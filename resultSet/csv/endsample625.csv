Their music combines elements of both groups, but it nearly became a casualty of the industry's current financial mess. Disappears were the very last act signed to Touch and Go before the label shut down, and as a result, their debut, <i>Lux</i>, was almost lost in the shuffle. Luckily they were eventually scooped up by Kranky, and though their style differs considerably from the experimental and ambient that label is known for, it seems a good fit for Disappears' dense and foreboding sound.</p>
<p>Disappears' sound is a pared-down, drone-heavy mixture of Velvet Underground scuzz, garage-rock energy, and krautrock propulsion. It may not feel like the most unique approach, but, importantly, the band seems aware of that. Part of Disappears' appeal is that they've chosen to work within a set of stylistic and sonic limitations, where vocals and instrumentation are stripped back to their most essential. It's more about minimalism and mastering the basics than making something brand-new.</p>
<p>It works because Disappears keep things tight; even though there's heaviness and repetition in these tracks, usually they're about three minutes long. ""Gone Completely"" is a killer opener, a rush of fuzz-laden guitars and simple, severe drumming. On this track and throughout the album, frontman Case's vocals are buried in the mix just right-- his delivery is kind of a Britt Daniel-meets-Iggy Pop sing-speak-- and clouded in the feedback his words sound more powerful, like they're trying to escape. The band mostly finds a comfortable zone and rides it, but each track tweaks the formula just so, and the mood stays jet-black dark throughout.</p>
<p>Things do start to feel a bit same-y toward the end of the record. On ""Little Ghost"" and ""New Cross"", it sounds like the band is revisiting ideas they touched on earlier. But when a group is working in such tight confines, some overlap is natural. That the goal here is intentionally limited ultimately works for and against Disappears-- they achieve the sound they want, and it does sound good, but it's hard to think of <i>Lux</i> as much more than that, because the components are so familiar. Still, that they're able to make these well-worn rock tropes feel quite so menacing after all this time is an achievement in its own right.</p></div>"|14162.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14162-lux/|6.9|Joe Colly

The reservoir of out-of-print/never-in-print gems from the fertile late 1970s and early 80s would have to dry up, and that hasn't happened yet. The last few years alone have seen excellent reissues of San Francisco's Units, New York's Interference, London's Lines, and Georgia's Method Actors. Writing about the latter, <i>Pitchfork</i>'s Andy Battaglia guessed that the ""post-punk vault... would almost have to be empty at this point.""</p>
<p>You'd think so, but mere weeks after the Method Actors release, Drag City has unearthed another treasure deserving of a new audience. Formed in Louisville in 1978, the Endtables lasted less that two years, releasing just one four-song EP while together. <i>The Endtables</i> compiles that EP, a posthumous two-song single, and six live tracks, painting a quick, sharp portrait of a band that sounded like they were in a hurry. Chugging along at a palpitating clip, the group flies toward the sun of the Buzzcocks and Gang of Four, but something about their hyper energy makes them a little more off-kilter than those groups. Like a sonic game of Jenga, their tunes feel like they could spill into unruly cacophony at the slightest nudge.</p>
<p>That never happens, but it's not for lack of pushing and shoving by guitarist Alex Durig and singer Steve Rigot. Rigot in particular has a uniquely skewed rhythm, biting off his words in strident yelps like the Undertones' Feargal Sharkey if you cut all of his lines in half. One of the best things about post-punk was the way many singers-- Ian Curtis, Mark Mothersbaugh, David Thomas-- turned technically imperfect voices into weapons through phrasing and attitude. Thomas may be the closest parallel to the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqB6HrZsst0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bulbous</a> Rigot, who certainly deserves a place in that patchwork pantheon of inventive vocalists. Durig is equally creative, slashing his chords across the songs like a whip across skin. But it's Rigot's delivery that gives these songs a mix of robotic staccato and wiry nerve.</p>
<p>Highlights abound-- the engine-rev of ""Process of Elimination"", the rubber-band snap of ""Circumcision""-- but the six studio songs are most notable for how little they deviate from the quality level established in the first note. The live tracks are less even-- endearingly earnest and raw but often rather illegible. A few little twists, like an interlude of Clean-style garage swing in ""Europe"", a song they never recorded in the studio, hint at some other places this band could've gone. But as a self-contained document of a lightning-quick, pretension-free moment in time, <i>The Endtables </i>is pretty spot on.</p></div>"|14166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14166-the-endtables/|7.5|Marc Masters

Musicians-- like A.P. Carter, who scrambled up and down Clinch Mountain in the late 1920s, collecting local songs for the Carter Family's repertoire-- have been reinventing folk songs since before we knew to call them folk songs. That's part of what folk music is, and does. What separates Amidon from the scrum of revivalists and archivists is how modern these renditions are. <i>I See the Sign</i>, Amidon's third folk LP, doesn't contain any original tracks, but his interpretations are so singular that it stops mattering how (or if) these songs existed before-- all that matters is how they exist now.</p>
<p>Amidon grew up singing folk music in Brattleboro, Vermont; his parents were members of the Word of Mouth chorus, a community choir which performed sacred harp hymns in the 1970s. Culturally, folk music is inextricably linked to the south (and Appalachia in particular), but rural Vermont has birthed its fair share of traditional strummers (pick up Margaret MacArthur's <i>Folksongs of Vermont</i> for an impeccable primer). Amidon inhabits these songs comfortably, with an ease that belies a childhood spent with a fiddle in one hand and a banjo in the other.</p>
<p>Much of <i>I See the Sign</i>'s success can be chalked up to its arrangements, which are fractured and frequently off-kilter; Amidon and his cabal of collaborators-- Nico Muhly, Ben Frost, Shahzad Ismaily-- have been merging chamber music with indie rock for awhile now (see also: Sufjan Stevens, Thomas Bartlett, Owen Pallett, Bryce and Aaron Dessner of the National), and their touch is nuanced and, on occasion, delightfully odd. Bits of percussion, distorted bursts of Moog, and hits of celesta pop up and recede, snapping into place like puzzle pieces. The arrangements are never bombastic (unlike what happens when, say, a pop artist gets paired with a philharmonic)-- instead, they're violent (the stabbing bass and scuttling percussion of opener ""Here Come That Blood"") or stiff and lonely (the restrained electric guitar and puffs of strings on ""I See the Sign""). On ""You Better Mind"", Amidon, harmonizing with Beth Orton, gets backup from threatening squeals of strings: ""You've got to give an account of the judgment, you better mind,"" they caution. Their voices are grave, concerned.</p>
<p>As a vocalist, Amidon is preternaturally calm, and his flat repetition of certain couplets (""Found my lost sheep,"" ""Loose horse in the valley"") feels mesmeric and mantra-like. He's poised, but never cold, and <i>I See the Sign</i> can play like a gospel record, with all the attendant modes and lessons. These are songs to live by (or in), and these iterations-- despite their sophistication, despite his stoicism-- never feel like museum pieces or anything less than functional.</p>
<p>The only non-traditional track here is a cover of R. Kelly's ""Relief"". On paper, the choice feels a little like a trap (R. Kelly fills an odd role for overeducated indie rockers), or at least a posture-- and while it could be didactic or a lame grasp at irony, Amidon's rendition is stunning. ""What a relief to know that/ The war is over,"" he and Orton sing, their voices earnest and tough, rising over the album's thickest, most optimistic swells. When Amidon finds an affirmation of faith-- ""What a relief to know that/ There's an angel in the sky,"" he sings, grateful-- it's hard not to feel that liberation deep down in your gut.</p></div>"|14149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14149-i-see-the-sign/|8.1|Amanda Petrusich

Three of them mention the smell of patchouli. Such were the times, certainly, but the ISB are loved equally by avant-garde musicians, psychedelia enthusiasts, and those slightly dweeby young gentlemen who hang around music shops on college campuses.  The reissue of their first four albums probably put to rest any notion that the ISB were a properly great band, releasing just one true classic, but they were rarely anything less than brave, inspired, and profoundly weird.</p>
<p>These reissues contain no extras or unreleased material, which might call to question their utility, but much of this music has been out of print in the U.S., or at least difficult to acquire, for years (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11760-incredible-string-band-liquid-acrobat-as-regards-the-air/"" target=""_blank"">previous reclamations</a> only unearthed odd pieces of the catalog). The remastering was necessary, but my old copy of <i>The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter</i> never sounded too thin or affectless; the new versions offer more space between the instruments and a general clarity, but they're not revelations in the way that many mid-1960s edits are.</p>
<p>The ISB probably weren't the first band to incorporate Eastern modes and instruments into folk music, but they were the first to achieve any manner of noticeable repute doing so. By 1968 the group was selling out venues like the Royal Albert Hall; they played at Woodstock. They had famous fans-- Paul McCartney and Robert Plant were public admirers-- and they still do: Stephen Malkmus once called ISB ""the greatest band of all time.""  There remain plenty of reasons to think about the ISB in 2010, not the least of which are the raves garnered by the likes of Joanna Newsom and Grizzly Bear. Messy, schoolyard orchestras like Neutral Milk Hotel and the Decemberists owe a debt as well.</p>
<p>The ISB met while playing in folk clubs around Scotland. They started slowly: Their self-titled debut was a mostly guitars-and-voices affair that openly aped Bob Dylan and Donovan. Heron and Williamson would grow to be legitimately adventurous songwriters, but neither is an overbearing personality, and the debut is understated. Gypsy violins (""Maybe Someday"") and Celtic influences (""Schaeffer's Jig"") hinted at broader vistas, but the self-titled is strictly for completists.</p>
<p>After the debut, Palmer split for the hippie trail while Williamson departed for Morocco, later returning with armfuls of (at the time) exotic instruments. <i>The 5000 Spirits or Layers of the Onion</i> was released during 1967's ""Summer of Love"", and everything from the album's painfully fried cover to its gently progressive arrangements (sitars, saloon pianos, bongos) reinforces this. Williamson and Heron earn credit as individual songwriters, and each album contains hints of competition. Heron wins <i>5000 Spirits</i> via ""The Hedgehog's Song"", a small blues-pop masterpiece, and the fact that the more adventurous Williamson still seems dependent on the facile eccentricity of psychedelia.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, was facile about <i>The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter</i>. The band finally earns its name, stuffing complex songs full of dulcimers, gimbris, ouds, and harps. The ISB are pretty easy to figure out, if you want to: <i>Hangman's</i> is their best album, and its centerpiece, Heron's ""A Very Cellular Song"", is their best song. It's a 13-minute tour de force, and I'd swap the band's first two albums for it to last one minute longer, so completely does it outpace the rest of their catalog. The rest of <i>Hangman's</i> is similarly superior, as everything from the pop gems (""Mercy I Cry City"") to the true oddities (""The Minotaur's Song"", in which the narrator bellows, ""Porridge for my porridge bowl!"" and a chorus echoes him, ""Porridge for his porridge bowl!"") seem richer, weirder, and more fun.</p>
<p><i>Hangman's</i> showed the band could benefit from excess, and its 2xLP followup, <i>Wee Tam and the Big Huge</i>, tested that. Released the same year as <i>Hangman's</i>, Official Band Girlfriends Rose and Licorice played increasing roles in loosely conceived epics about religion and myth. It's easier listening than <i>Hangman's</i>, with the band blending psych and folk smoothly; sitars rub against guitars without any hint of experimentation. Williamson's monstrous nine-minute jams (""Ducks on a Pond"" and ""Maya"") themselves justify the sprawl, but the band also loses itself in religious imagery (""The Mountain of God"") and far-flung melodies.</p>
<p>Many reissues see the involved rally around the idea that it's ""all about the music, man"" in some sort of arcane attempt to shout down context. The ISB are delightfully aware of their place in history, as everything from their essays to the unmistakably dated <i>5000 Spirits</i> suggests. The patchouli, it turns out, <i>mattered</i>. But the ISB helped bring Eastern and African influence to folk music, and <i>Hangman's</i> and <i>WT&amp;TBH</i> set the table for some of the conceptual epics we still see today.

<p>These reissues contain no extras or unreleased material, which might call to question their utility, but much of this music has been out of print in the U.S., or at least difficult to acquire, for years (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11760-incredible-string-band-liquid-acrobat-as-regards-the-air/"" target=""_blank"">previous reclamations</a> only unearthed odd pieces of the catalog). The remastering was necessary, but my old copy of <i>The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter</i> never sounded too thin or affectless; the new versions offer more space between the instruments and a general clarity, but they're not revelations in the way that many mid-1960s edits are.</p>
<p>The ISB probably weren't the first band to incorporate Eastern modes and instruments into folk music, but they were the first to achieve any manner of noticeable repute doing so. By 1968 the group was selling out venues like the Royal Albert Hall; they played at Woodstock. They had famous fans-- Paul McCartney and Robert Plant were public admirers-- and they still do: Stephen Malkmus once called ISB ""the greatest band of all time.""  There remain plenty of reasons to think about the ISB in 2010, not the least of which are the raves garnered by the likes of Joanna Newsom and Grizzly Bear. Messy, schoolyard orchestras like Neutral Milk Hotel and the Decemberists owe a debt as well.</p>
<p>The ISB met while playing in folk clubs around Scotland. They started slowly: Their self-titled debut was a mostly guitars-and-voices affair that openly aped Bob Dylan and Donovan. Heron and Williamson would grow to be legitimately adventurous songwriters, but neither is an overbearing personality, and the debut is understated. Gypsy violins (""Maybe Someday"") and Celtic influences (""Schaeffer's Jig"") hinted at broader vistas, but the self-titled is strictly for completists.</p>
<p>After the debut, Palmer split for the hippie trail while Williamson departed for Morocco, later returning with armfuls of (at the time) exotic instruments. <i>The 5000 Spirits or Layers of the Onion</i> was released during 1967's ""Summer of Love"", and everything from the album's painfully fried cover to its gently progressive arrangements (sitars, saloon pianos, bongos) reinforces this. Williamson and Heron earn credit as individual songwriters, and each album contains hints of competition. Heron wins <i>5000 Spirits</i> via ""The Hedgehog's Song"", a small blues-pop masterpiece, and the fact that the more adventurous Williamson still seems dependent on the facile eccentricity of psychedelia.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, was facile about <i>The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter</i>. The band finally earns its name, stuffing complex songs full of dulcimers, gimbris, ouds, and harps. The ISB are pretty easy to figure out, if you want to: <i>Hangman's</i> is their best album, and its centerpiece, Heron's ""A Very Cellular Song"", is their best song. It's a 13-minute tour de force, and I'd swap the band's first two albums for it to last one minute longer, so completely does it outpace the rest of their catalog. The rest of <i>Hangman's</i> is similarly superior, as everything from the pop gems (""Mercy I Cry City"") to the true oddities (""The Minotaur's Song"", in which the narrator bellows, ""Porridge for my porridge bowl!"" and a chorus echoes him, ""Porridge for his porridge bowl!"") seem richer, weirder, and more fun.</p>
<p><i>Hangman's</i> showed the band could benefit from excess, and its 2xLP followup, <i>Wee Tam and the Big Huge</i>, tested that. Released the same year as <i>Hangman's</i>, Official Band Girlfriends Rose and Licorice played increasing roles in loosely conceived epics about religion and myth. It's easier listening than <i>Hangman's</i>, with the band blending psych and folk smoothly; sitars rub against guitars without any hint of experimentation. Williamson's monstrous nine-minute jams (""Ducks on a Pond"" and ""Maya"") themselves justify the sprawl, but the band also loses itself in religious imagery (""The Mountain of God"") and far-flung melodies.</p>
<p>Many reissues see the involved rally around the idea that it's ""all about the music, man"" in some sort of arcane attempt to shout down context. The ISB are delightfully aware of their place in history, as everything from their essays to the unmistakably dated <i>5000 Spirits</i> suggests. The patchouli, it turns out, <i>mattered</i>. But the ISB helped bring Eastern and African influence to folk music, and <i>Hangman's</i> and <i>WT&amp;TBH</i> set the table for some of the conceptual epics we still see today. The Incredible String Band: come for the context, stay for the minotaur's porridge.</p></div>"|14153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14153-the-incredible-string-band-the-5000-spirits-or-the-layers-of-the-onion-the-hangmans-beautiful-daughter-wee-tam-and-the-big-huge/|8.1|Andrew Gaerig

It's hard for a band that operates on their level-- semi-prominent in certain circles with the odd stab of almost-fame here and there, such as when they opened for Tool-- to keep people interested for that long. They seemed sort of on their way in the late 1990s, when they were at their peak, making records that in hindsight anticipated some of the trends of the following decade at the crossroads of rock and electronic music. A couple of substandard albums in the early to mid-00s seemed to kill their momentum, but 2007's <i>Sex Change </i>was a strong return to form, and now we have the band's ninth proper album, <i>Thing</i>, which isn't quite as solid as its predecessor but still plays to the band's strengths.</p>
<p>They've backed off the very up-front and straight vocals that helped <i>Sex Change</i> sound so fresh for them-- on the only two tracks with vocals, Means hides inside a vocoder cocoon that works well but still feels like a retreat to their comfort zone, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. So you get your sci-fi post-rock like ""Space Dock"", which would fit neatly on the Tron soundtrack, and ""Naked Singularity"", which is like the ""Knight Rider"" theme turned inside out and remixed with heavy metal drums.</p>
<p>For a band that never seemed to take itself all that seriously, the aesthetic decisions Trans Am made ages ago fit with remarkably well with what's going on in music now. The nods to funk, the krautrock rhythms, the hints of electro, the occasional glitch in the beat-- all are just part of indie rock these days. There are times when Trans Am does it better than anyone-- fractured and funky ""Arcadia"", with its storm of delayed guitar set against locked-in drums and sequencer, is a good example, while ""Interstellar Drift"" does something similar, only with an insistent motorik bass and drum pulse.</p>
<p>And so Trans Am are in an odd place. The band is the oblivious kid that that never paid attention to fashion who suddenly finds that the look he's always had is cool. They still gets bogged down in places, padding the album with go-nowhere interludes and a six-minute centerpiece that's mostly too chaotic to make any impact, but on the album's best tracks, it's great to hear them again, doing what they do best.</p></div>"|14116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14116-thing/|6.7|Joe Tangari

For a while, Starkey fit this profile. The Philly-based producer's early releases (""Corner Store Riddim"", ""Pins"", ""Bounce"") sounded like a dry run for a new, heavy American take on classic 2-step. Starkey's debut album, <i>Ephemeral Exhibits</i>, put the gloss on his street bass sound: The beats stayed massive, but rave pianos, electro synths, and ghostly, pitched-up divas gave them a bright neon hue. Starkey's gift for matching melodic complexity to his forceful rhythms became clear-- tracks that could've otherwise just sounded huge wound up feeling moving as well. With his second album, <i>Ear Drums and Black Holes</i>, Starkey amplifies those tendencies-- every beat is matched to a soulful melody.</p>
<p>Granted, it's a particularly wonky kind of soul. Starkey's compositions are filtered through the heavy buzzes and oscillating warbles of the post-Joker sound. So you get these soaring, emotive melodies, with 2-step beats loosely translated into contemporary R&amp;B (""Neck Snap"") or American club rap (""Murderous Words"") that unfold into ultra-dense counterpoints between sweetly toned harmonies and clobbering low-end. And the tracks get more compelling the further those roles are blurred: The fundamentals of great bass music rely on every component reacting to and building on the rhythm, and in the purplish ""11th Hour"" or the rave-evoking ""Multidial"", multiple rhythms merge into a big wave of percussive harmony. The effect is nothing short of euphoric.</p>
<p>Yet for all its epic sweep, there's a certain lightheartedness and a sly sense of humor here-- a self-aware sense of playing with stylistic expectations. When the Underworld-esque ""Fourth Dimension"" baits the listener with a 4/4 throb in its first minute, only to switch to a gelatinous bassline, it's a great joke; when Starkey reincorporates the false-start melody into the track midway through, it's a stroke of brilliance. And even the Auto-Tune makes an odd sort of sense, cropping up on ""Spacecraft"" and ""Alienstyles"" where it feels right at home in the tracks' subtly tongue-in-cheek sci-fi futurism.</p>
<p>Starkey's style is rich with crossover potential, yet it could use a bit more adaptation to the hip-hop influences with which it feels made to fuse. Maybe it comes down to picking the right MC for the job-- ""Bounce"" combined dubstep with Young Dro's hook and made it work, after all-- but Starkey's beats accommodate Londoner P Money's rapidfire grime flow (""Numb"") more comfortably than the simple, halting cadence of San Antonio indie-rapper Cerebral Vortex (""Murderous Words""; ""Club Games""). Still, the job of bringing dubstep to the States has a worthy heir in Starkey, an ambassador of the style that proves American crowds don't have to stick with the hard and bleak.</p></div>"|14126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14126-ear-drums-and-black-holes/|7.9|Nate Patrin

Ever since he served as drummer and singer in the notorious Canadian punk act the Spaceshits in the 1990s, he's been fashioning harsh psych, rangey country, dreamy doo-wop, 50s juvie punk, and anarchic noise into strange, catchy, jubilant, occasionally jokey pop songs. He's also made a virtue out of his one-man-band set-up and his irreverent affection for the darker corners of rock history. In the last year, he has branched out into more collaborative projects, however-- donning a choir robe for the garage-gospel group the Almighty Defenders, a (hopefully) one-off collaboration with Black Lips, and playing Ding to Bloodshot Bill's Dong in the Ding-Dongs. Sultan also resumed his role in BBQ Show for another album (and a coloring book!) with friend and longtime cohort King Khan.</p>
<p>As plain-old Mark Sultan, however, Mark Sultan is less prolific, with only one solo album and a string of one-man-band shows under a variety of increasingly bizarre pseudonyms like Celeb Prenup and Blortz. Whatever banner he's flying, however, the sound remains the same, and his latest effort-- which isn't titled so much as branded with a dollar sign-- snaps and crackles with a familiar, flailing energy, as if any of these songs might fall apart at any moment. With a voice that recalls Afghan Whigs' Greg Dulli and Journey's Steve Perry in equal measure, Sultan reigns over the album, whether singing against a broken music box and shredding guitar or crooning on R&amp;B-rattled tracks.</p>
<p>Especially compared to King Khan's thousand-limbed Shrines, Sultan emphasizes austerity and economy, and his one-man band sounds most invigorated when he's immediate and concise, entertaining a melody and an idea for no more than a few minutes before fixing his gaze on the next. Too often on <i>$</i> he makes too much of a glorious mess. Songs meander, repeat sections to diminishing returns, and often just hang around too long. Opener ""Icicles"" begins with an aimless guitar jam that staggers around
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
for four tiresome minutes before finally getting to the end of the song; it's like listening to ice melt. ""Ten of Hearts"" may be one of his best doo-wop retreads, cutting through a lot of the revivalism to express something sincere and bittersweet, but there's no reason for it to be five minutes long. It'd be a tragedy if Sultan ever curtailed his wilder impulses or slowed his pace, but reining in his indulgences might have turned <i>$</i> into <i>$$</i>.</p></div>"|14145.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14145-dollar-sign/|6.8|Stephen M.

His albums have felt warm, loose, and ecstatic (especially 2003's still-career-best <i>Up in Flames</i>), despite Snaith's behind-the-boards meticulousness.</p>
<p>Snaith's latest, <i>Swim</i>, is even heavier on the precise sonic detail, and it's all the more impressive for it. Made with help from kindred spirits including Four Tet's Kieran Hebden, Junior Boys' Jeremy Greenspan, and Born Ruffians' Luke Lalonde, it was borne out of a desire to create ""dance music that sounds like it's made out of water."" <i>Swim</i> is darker both in tone and spirit than its predecessor, 2007's day-glo <i>Andorra</i>, swapping expansive drum-circle arrangements and ebullience for chilly rhythms and a bummed-out disposition. Easy entrance points here are scarcer than on any of Snaith's previous full-lengths-- as with 2005's kraut-centric <i>The Milk of Human Kindness</i>, repeat listens are key.</p>
<p>The record kicks off with its most accessible moment, ""Odessa"". Seasick bass, snatches of flute and guitar, and Snaith's mannered patter combine to give the song a pop-centric lean. But the song's easy appeal makes it easy to miss important details, like the ghosted acid-house bleat and lyrics about a break-up (""Taking the kids/ Driving away/ Turning 'round the life she let him siphon away"") that establish <i>Swim</i>'s bleary-eyed atmosphere. Lyrically, Snaith seems preoccupied with relationship-related indecision and ennui-- a noticeable departure from <i>Andorra</i>'s moony-eyed devotionals. On the LP's other highlight, ""Kaili"", Snaith muses on a couple ruefully growing old together. Elsewhere, divorce and crumbling relationships permeate ""Found Out"" (whose female protagonist suffers hopelessness as ""she knows she'll be there on her own"") and empty-nest song ""Hannibal"".</p>
<p>Lonely feelings abound, as Snaith employs  textures and compositional tricks from minimal techno, house, and disco  to convey this distant melancholia. The harshly juxtaposed interplay of beats on ""Found Out"" make for punch-drunk club music, ""Leave House"" unfolds with LCD Soundsystem's dance-rock know-how, and the warning horns of ""Hannibal"" give way to a sequined breakdown deserving of any side-long disco edit. Unlike many artists who attempt to dive headlong into the genre, Snaith demonstrates a deep understanding of dance music-- not just how it works, but <i>why</i>, right down to its most pleasurable idiosyncratic tics.</p>
<p>This historian's grasp, combined with the way  Snaith's soft, out-of-phase vocals seem to hover over his productions, inevitably brings to mind Arthur Russell. But while Russell's spirit is indeed felt throughout <i>Swim</i>,  Snaith's sonic heart still belongs to hash-laced psych, from the drone and Gong-worthy chimes that run through ""Bowls"" to the vocal chants that break up ""Sun""'s tech-house throb. Proof that, despite his chameleonic tendencies, Dan Snaith retains his singular identity as an artist-- and <i>Swim</i> is a reminder that even at his most challenging, the man's compositional capabilities can dazzle.</p></div>"|14157.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14157-swim/|8.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

That's the from the liner notes to <i>The Kids at the Club</i>, a 2006 compilation that features one of the earliest tracks from the London sextet led by songwriter/guitarist Andrew Laidlaw and singer Ali Howard. The image is pure Lucky Soul: a party where the nice kids are also the outcasts.</p>
<p>It's also pure indie pop, but Lucky Soul were always out of step even among the Bowlie set. Their 2007 debut, <i>The Great Unwanted</i>, was not only meticulously crafted and emotionally overflowing, but also polished for a popular appeal it could never realistically attain. Not that it did poorly: Despite being self-released and receiving little attention from big U.S. print publications, the record boasts worldwide sales of 50,000 copies. Three years later, sophomore album <i>A Coming of Age</i> is that much further removed from prevailing trends, and it's not quite as immediately endearing, but it's a little more grown-up. And it's still pretty easy to like.</p>
<p>The state of pop influenced by 1960s girl groups, Motown, and soul has changed a lot since the indie boomlet that gave us Lucky Soul, the Pipettes, and so many others. From Sharon Jones to Duffy, pre-Beatles throwbacks are on the rise. Younger acts like Vivian Girls, Dum Dum Girls, and Best Coast inherit from early girl-group singers the shambling ""feel"" as much as the emotional directness, adding their own reverb and lo-fi scuzz. As for the Pipettes, on the basis of at least one new song, they've skipped straight to the 70s-- and lost much of the human tenderness that made them special in the first place.</p>
<p><i>A Coming of Age</i> attempts a subtler maturation, with mixed results. Drawing again from Spector- and Bacharach-sized 60s pop-- plus glam (""Woah Billy!""), country (""Love 3""), and singer-songwriters like Carole King (""Warm Water"")-- the songs are packed with hooks, but they don't sink in as easily as before. For every ""White Russian Doll"", which bounds into the sort of romantic shadows where the Long Blondes used to smolder, or the title track, with its just-late-enough ""...come too late!"", there's a, well, ""Ain't Nothin' Like a Shame"". Still, Lucky Soul's latest proves once again that well-wrought, traditional melodic narratives packed with handclaps, strings, horns, whoa-oh-ohs, yeah-yeah-yeahs, and heartbreak can succeed without being painstakingly retro or modestly muffled. They only have to connect.</p>
<p>The nice kids are no longer so nice, nor such kids, but they're still just as unfashionably welcoming. The closest comparison to <i>A Coming of Ag</i>e is the 60s-steeped adult-pop of Stuart Murdoch's God Help the Girl project, except instead of fitting into indie's niche mindset, Laidlaw's glistening production doubles down on Lucky Soul's (poignantly unlikely) radio-readiness. Howard's delicately forceful lilt, which brings to mind Dusty Springfield and Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell, has only grown stronger, more supple. The debut's teenage themes, meanwhile, give way here to sadness, loss of innocence, and mortality. On <i>The Great Unwanted</i>, Howard sang, ""I ain't never been cool."" Now, she concludes, ""It could be that I just don't belong-- anywhere but here.""</p></div>"|14118.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14118-a-coming-of-age/|6.4|Marc Hogan

On the rare  occasion when he gives an idea the time to develop, he too often  suffocates it by packing too much in. Even his best work, 2003's  outré-rap collaboration with Busdriver and Radioinactive, <i>The  Weather</i>, was tainted by his weaker re-work, <i>Rethinking the  Weather</i>.</p>
<p>Still, despite Darlington's discography, it isn't unreasonable to at least  expect a slight uptick in quality from <i>Righteous Fists of  Harmony</i>, his new EP for Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label, which is being  put out as a prelude to a full-length for Ninja Tune later this year.  There's no better time than now for Darlington to redefine his  reputation as an artist, especially in a scene where his peers (FlyLo,  Dâm-Funk, Gaslamp Killer) are establishing more fully realized styles  and developing a higher profile.</p>
<p>It turns out that a slight uptick in quality is exactly what <i>Righteous  Fists of Harmony</i> delivers. It opens with a six-minute piece pitting minor-key drone against boilerplate glitch-hop, and it closes with a bit of soundtrack schmaltz; sandwiched between are takes on color-bled balladry, blunted electronica, and Brazilian-inflected lounge, with little apparent regard to sequencing. Even though it has just eight tracks and runs a little over 26 minutes, it's still  a mess</p>
<p>The aforementioned Brazilian influence is the only idea here that really feels fleshed out. Elsewhere, the EP leans more toward halfway interesting fragments: ""Tidal Waves Uprising"" begins with slowly picked acoustic guitar, delicately building urgency with measured snare hits and added guitar tracks, while EP centerpiece ""Order of the Golden Dawn"", features wife and frequent collaborator Laura Darlington doing her best Astrud Gilberto impression to a surprisingly strong effect. These okay moments, taken together, don't add up to much. Instead of giving listeners a distillation of his strengths, Darlington has produced what is essentially a so-so Savath y Savalas EP. After nearly a decade at it, he really doesn't need any more sources in his work; instead, his music needs some space to breathe and grow.</p></div>"|14127.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14127-righteous-fists-of-harmony/|5.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

Just listening to <i>Where Is the Truth</i>, the Brooklyn-based UK emigre's new album inspired by that discovery, neither would you. This founding member of UK electro-shoegaze pioneers Seefeel-- later known for his 1990s electronic output as Locust-- returns at a time when a similar strain of woozily psychedelic synth-pop has made the leap to indie prominence. Though not to be confused with chillwave or ""hypnagogic pop,"" Van Hoen's first new record in six years serves as a reminder that wistfully nostalgic electronic haziness is no Gen Y novelty-- and ups the sound-design ante for the contemporary style's typically lo-fi practitioners.</p>
<p>Musically, Van Hoen belongs to a distinguished family tree. Originally influenced by the likes of Brian Eno and Tangerine Dream, and later presaging both Autechre's glitch and Boards of Canada's pastoral IDM, with his latest album Van Hoen would fit in just as well alongside White Rainbow or Atlas Sound on a current label like Kranky: He combines oceanic drone with pop lyricism, using technology as a catalyst. On ""A Glimmer of Forgotten Ancestors"", a mesmerizing 23-minute epic from 1997's <i>The Last Flowers From the Darkness</i>, he excerpts a wonderful quote where, in the full remarks, you can hear Gandhi go on to say, ""God is...truth."" Bearing that in mind, then, as well as Van Hoen's newfound knowledge of the truth about himself, it seems best to approach <i>Where Is the Truth</i> as an album of-- but not <i>about</i>-- inner spiritual search.</p>
<p>It's an intricately constructed album, at that. Vintage synthesizers, tape, radio, drums, and Van Hoen's airy vocals join with elegaic electric guitar by Neil Halstead (Slowdive, Mojave 3) and somber piano by Julia Frodahl (New York septet Edison Woods) to tastefully evoke a journey of self-discovery. The emphasis on abstraction means that in casual settings, the more abstract tracks-- such as fragile organ-and-Orchestron opener ""Put My Trust in You""-- may tend to drag. And the ones with vocals-- even the fantastically falsetto-led ""She's Selda"", or murkily propulsive ""Render the Voice""-- don't quite communicate the way many pop fans would expect. Still, when you can spare your full attention, the album's meticulous production and nuanced conceptual unity make for a uniquely captivating listening experience-- a lot more cerebral than the stoner bliss-outs of the chillwavers, sure, but still related. Van Hoen may have found himself in more ways than he expected.</p></div>"|14150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14150-where-is-the-truth/|7.2|Marc Hogan

It's an exciting moment for soul music, as albums by Jones, Fields, Walker's the Dynamites, and now Kings Go Forth indicate these older musicians are taking nothing for granted, which lends their music an urgency that transcends mere revivalism.</p>
<p>The musician known as Black Wolf wasn't well known outside the world of cratediggers and soul enthusiasts when he struck up a conversation with Andy Noble, owner of Lotus Records in Milwaukee. During the 1970s, Black Wolf had been a member of the Essentials, a regional soul act whose claim to fame was recording in Curtis Mayfield's studio. He and Noble started a new band and named it Kings Go Forth, after a 1958 Frank Sinatra-Tony Curtis movie. Since then, the 10-member, intergenerational outfit has released a series of 7"" singles and gradually but determinedly built a reputation as a dynamic live act, settling easily into complex grooves that highlight Black Wolf's high-flying vocals. Along the way, the band has picked up some notable admirers: Famed disco DJ Tom Moulton, who really did invent the remix, mixed their ""Don't Take My Shadow"", and D.C. folk artist Mingering Mike, famous for painting covers for imaginary albums, created the artwork for the first Kings Go Forth full-length, <i>The Outsiders Are Back</i>.</p>
<p>This record gathers singles dating back to 2007 yet proves cohesive and consistent. Rather than a collection of mismatched parts, <i>Outsiders</i> sounds like a unified work, even if it does showcase the range of their sound and chops. Kings Go Forth run through soul-revue rave-ups as well as midtempo vocal-group numbers, and they even dabble in reggae on the snaky ""1000 Songs"". Drummer Jeremy Kuzniar's casually complex beats propel the songs forcefully. From that sturdy foundation, Kings Go Forth build songs full of punchy horns and swelling strings, topping off everything with insistent vocals from Black Wolf, Dan Fernandez, and Matt Norberg. None of the singers has the presence and personality of, say, Sharon Jones, but they compensate by trading off lead and back-up frequently, recalling groups like the Temptations and the Pips one minute and solo soul stirrers like Otis Redding or Lou Rawls the next.</p>
<p>Of course it sounds great: Adherence to period-appropriate production techniques is a bedrock tenet of the soul revival, so the album could be mistaken for a decades-old artifact. That's not an end in itself, but a means of bolstering the band's sound and ratcheting up the tension of their grooves. The horn breakdown on the sped-up ""I Don't Love You No More"" sounds like all of Michael Masser &amp; Mandrill squaring off against Ali, and ""You're the One"" bursts out in Technicolor vocals that stretch from Philly all the way to Motown. <i>Outsiders</i>, however, never comes across like a pastiche of old styles and steps. Instead, the urgency of these songs reveals a band anchored strongly in the present but with their eyes toward the future.</p></div>"|14152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14152-the-outsiders-are-back/|7.8|Stephen M.

<p>His work with the band, too, results in some fairly perfunctory arrangements; in hindsight, it's easy to see where a big crescendo might have gone had they had the means to pull one off at the time. The bouncy synth-pop breakdown in ""The Space Race"" is the first real evidence of his penchant for throwing a lot of unexpected elements into a song and making them stick.

It's more patient, more deliberate, and much more confident; the singing improves vastly, and the songs cease feeling like vehicles for spitting out lyrics.</p>
<p>All the hallmarks of Destroyer as we know them now are here: Rousing instrumental passages, lots of la-da-da's, effusive underlining of key phrases.

As much as Destroyer is about excess, <i>Thief</i> sometimes bites off more than Bejar could chew at that point, and the duller bits obscure the moments of graceful abandon.</p>
<p>But then there's <i>Streethawk</i>, a record of practically nothing <i>but</i> graceful abandon. Each line seems immaculately crafted, every note falling into perfect order, every word sung with the proper bite and bile.

<p>Bejar's pop songcraft gets a real shot in the arm here; instead of burying his best lines in verses, he builds his rave-ups around them, and the songs feel like a series of unlikely peaks that, in less able hands, would topple in seconds.

Their woefully overlooked 2008 debut full-length, <i>Parc Avenue</i>, was ripe to be expanded upon. Full of spacious, mostly acoustic almost-folk sounds, it spackled rich, otherworldly harmonies and honeyed, finger-picked guitar lines over rambling epics. On <i>Parc Avenue</i>, P&amp;A drew a direct line between the bearded Laurel Canyon folk-rockers of the 1970s and the modern psychedelia of bands like Animal Collective. But <i>La La Land</i>, unfortunately, is more concerned with plugging in and cranking up the volume than it is with the subtleties that colored its predecessor.</p>
<p>As its title suggest, <i>La La Land </i>sounds very much like the glitzy, tough L.A. It's not just song titles like ""Tom Cruz"", ""American Idol"", and ""Kon Tiki"" (named for a tacky L.A. hotel) that recall the entertainment capital, but also the album's fuzzed-out Sunset Strip guitar tones, kinetic, urban rhythms, and glossy production makeover. Yet while there is laudable roughness  and robustness to these harder charging tracks, no amount of energy or amplification can obscure  a song's bloat or lack of memorable hooks. Plants and Animals' strong suit  was never the sing-along chorus or the earworm melody, but this new album's aggressiveness-- which plays in stark contrast to the casual,  country-stoner pace of its precursor-- combined with the punch of its guitar  sound, makes you long for tight pop hooks that never come.</p>
<p>However, amid the album's overstuffed and more conventionally paced tracks, some beautifully strange gems can be unearthed. Unsurprisingly, the album's best moments most closely resemble the meandering songs of <i>Parc Avenue</i>. Songs like ""Game Show"" and ""Undone Melody"", which hinge on gritty acoustic foundations and climax with uplifting harmonies, represent the band's most logical progressions from <i>Parc Avenue</i>. The best use of their new plugged-in sound is<span> ""American Idol"", which, with the rhythmic patter of its vocals and the percussive groove of its riffs, sounds more like Talking Heads than Plants and Animals. So while <i>La La Land</i> may not be the stellar follow-up that <i>Parc Avenue</i> deserved, it does offer something for fans willing to look beyond its tarted-up exterior.</span></p></div>"|14123.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14123-la-la-land/|6.1|Rebecca Raber

Their caricatures of hip-hop boogeymen were never going to change anyone's mind about, say, DipSet, but the rush to caricature <i>them</i> as the backpacker fun police instead of talented rappers almost certainly resulted in people slagging off worthy projects like Foreign Exchange, the Chittlin' Circuit, and, oddly enough, their mixtape with DJ Drama.</p>
<p>To their credit, Little Brother have gone to lengths to make things right themselves. The key lyric on <i>LeftBack</i>, Little Brother's presumably final studio album is, ""Not mad at the radio/ 'Cause I don't know what's on it."" There is a subtle yet important shift in tone here: On albums past, this message might've been meant as a boast. On <i>LeftBack</i>, Little Brother acknowledge that rather than being defined by their perceived opposition, they're but one of many options.</p>
<p>Little Brother were always pretty entertaining when they weren't burdening themselves with hip-hop's salvation, but ultimately your enjoyment of <i>LeftBack </i>can boil down to whether you care about Phonte and Pooh debating if they can leave the game alone when it doesn't need them. Even on the triumphant career retrospective ""Curtain Call"", the two can't help but live with regret, blaming <i>The Minstrel Show</i>'s commercial failure on listeners not appreciating ""the real on the reel.""</p>
<p>More than ever, Little Brother appear to be a two sides to one group; duality informs nearly the entirety of <i>LeftBack</i>. There's almost an even split between ""for the love"" rap ciphers with peers like Truck North and Khrysis, and ""for <i>your </i>love"" relationship songs. Big Pooh comes off like the guy who's most intent on pursuing a new solo career, but he continues to be casually outshined by Phonte, whose nonchalance deflates even his corniest rhymes (""not being Cam'ron-ish, I mean diplomatic""). And while Phonte is trying to establish himself as viable outside of his collaborations, he constantly questions his commitment-- he appreciates what ""the kids"" are doing, but admits, ""one day I was playin' my old shit like 'who the fuck is this, I kinda miss this dude.'""</p>
<p>But even those of us who don't have an issue with their subject matter have been subjected to increasingly monochromatic listening experiences. Used to be you could blame that on 9th Wonder, but even with other producers, Phonte and Pooh seem incapable of rapping over something other than mostly interchangeable soul backdrops with papery drums that split the difference between handclaps and snares. Phonte raps, ""fuck if I'm goin' to be doin' this shit when I'm 60,"" but Little Brother were always well-suited to the mindset of rap as easy-listening.</p>
<p>In the end, the finality of <i>LeftBack </i>sticks with you more than anything, because unlike many rappers promising the same thing, Little Brother seem like they really mean it-- not to mention that a three-way Twitter beef with 9th Wonder over a disputed beat really felt like the final coffin nail, appropriate for a group whose narrative took place almost entirely on the Internet. But if <i>LeftBack </i>really is the end for Little Brother, it's a fitting epitaph for a likeable act who just could never seem to get out of their own way.</p></div>"|14142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14142-leftback/|5.9|Ian Cohen

As fair-minded listeners, we try to resist the temptation, but we're all human. Take We Have Band, a group with a name so generic it verges on parody. Sadly, one listen to the Londoners' debut album, <i>WHB</i> (yes, the name was so good they took the abbreviated form as their album title), reveals that this is no joke, or at least not an intentional one.</p>
<p>In fact, We Have Band may well have crafted the most serious, fun-defying dance-punk record since the genre's mid-2000s rebirth. This is the sort of album that begins with a piano ballad called ""Piano"" and only gets progressively more stone-faced from there. Even tracks presumably intended to be carefree floor-fillers, like the bassline-flaunting lead single ""Divisive"", sound curiously and persistently uptight. ""Honeytrap"" is almost painfully strained, its incessant chant of ""It's time/ Rejoice/ Line up/ Clap hands/ Let's go"" more a joyless command than an invitation to hedonism.</p>
<p>In taking such a dour approach, We Have Band manage to strip the album of any tension. The songs are so cautious and timid, so hemmed in by precedent, that it leaves little room for the unexpected; the mind-numbingly literal titles tell you what's coming. If there's a metaphorical meaning to ""Centerfolds and Empty Screens"", good luck deciphering it amidst the whining about unmet ""needs."" And while ""Buffet"" may not be their rewrite of ""Banquet"", they seem all too happy to settle for their own watered-down version of ""So Here We Are"". Of course, given dance-punk's flagging fortunes, We Have Band offer a few requisite half-hearted attempts to remain current. ""Love, What Are You Doing?"", in particular, seems to exist solely to earn comparisons to their more openly 80s-venerating Kitsuné peers like Delphic and Chew Lips. It's a fleeting, superficial nod at best.</p>
<p>With ambiguity losing out to obviousness at every turn, it perhaps comes as no surprise to learn that all three members of We Have Band are ex-EMI employees. <i> WHB</i> often sounds like it came right off an A&amp;R assembly line, the various songs cobbled together from aborted Bloc Party, Foals, and Rapture album sessions. The result is a bland dance-punk Frankenstein.</p></div>"|14086.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14086-whb/|3.7|Jonathan Garrett

His candidly titled debut, <i>Glider</i>, efficiently fed different pitches into the same algorithm over and over. The compositions for EBowed and filtered guitars almost always began with clouds of long, singing tones, blossoming and decaying slowly. A muffled kick drum or bass pulse would add definition and momentum, and off we'd go. Small accents-- the scratch of a guitar string, or a reverbed snare-- made big differences. <i>Glider</i> distinguished itself by being indistinguishable-- solid from end to end, with deep replay value.</p>
<p>The Sight Below's latest LP, <i>It All Falls Apart</i>, retains the consistency and heavenly sound while upping the variety, which makes the reclusive composer feel more present as a personality. His tones are allowed to shred and convulse, and an enhanced low range gives them more depth than <i>Glider</i>'s sheer planes. The difference is apparent right away: Opener ""Shimmer"" is a beatless, interpenetrating study in light and dark, with richly corporeal textures at the end. The guitar theme on ""Fervent"" is abstracted in a bright slush of resonance, but sounds startlingly like a guitar. His music is still austere, but there's a new swerve to it. It's the sound of a perfectionist relenting.</p>
<p>Irisarri sounds confident, coming off of well-received gigs at MUTEK and SÓNAR, not to mention praise from Thom Yorke. He's also got a collaborator now; ex-Slowdive member Simon Scott, who knows a thing or two about massive, weightless sounds. There's a sense of human tension and drama that <i>Glider </i>lacked. There's even singing on ""New Dawn Fades"", a shoegaze version of the Joy Division song with piercing vocals by Jesy Fortino (aka Tiny Vipers). It's a bit jarring to hear singing-- let alone such emphatic singing-- in this context, but Irisarri wisely keeps the music scaled even bigger than the vocals, so they blend well. And the lyrics of the song connect with the music's new mojo: ""Different colors, different shapes."" From the tensely syncopated bassline of ""Burn Me Out From the Inside"", to the foamy distortion of the title track, to the long Excepter-ish unraveling of ""Stagger"", they just keep coming.</p></div>"|14137.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14137-it-all-falls-apart/|7.2|Brian Howe

It's a 2xLP set (also available as a download, no CD), and the packaging is minimal-- two slabs of vinyl, no notes, and all credits and recording info are printed on the disc labels. The functional nature of the package says, ""The music is what's important here."" Callahan kicks off the album by mumbling, ""We're gonna get right down to business,"" and then he and the band-- guitar, bass, drums, violins-- proceed to do just that. It's 2007, they are in a small club in Australia, and Callahan is drawing from a catalog of songs any songwriter would envy. Turned out to be a good night.</p>
<p>Though <i>Woke on a Whalehart</i>, Callahan's first album under his own name after leaving the name Smog behind, was just about to come out when <i>Rough Travel for a Rare Thing</i> was cut, the setlist focuses heavily on his previous full-length, 2005's <i>A River Ain't Too Much to Love</i>. Five of the 11 songs come from that release, with stops at <i>Supper</i>, the ""Rock Bottom Riser"" single, and <i>Knock Knock</i> along the way. There's one reach back to 1995's <i>Wild Love</i> (""Batheysphere""), and one tune from <i>Whaleheart </i>(""Diamond Dancer""). Heard together, with this band providing lean and effective accompaniment, the songs sound like they belong on a single album. <i>Rough Travel</i> flows. Callahan's voice, having grown richer and deeper over the years, is front and center, putting the focus squarely on the words and the way he phrases them. There's plenty going on there to keep things interesting.</p>
<p>Indeed, Callahan's singing is a model of how much can be done with a limited vocal range. Sometimes he's half-talking and telling stories. Sometimes he's bending lines to put emphasis on certain words. Sometimes he's doing something close to a croon. In every case, his vocals are bound to the lyrics and reflect how he writes. The songs here are on the long side-- six minutes or so on average-- but it's not because Callahan wastes words. He knows when to leave space, and he has a way of making hard, clear images stay in your mind. When he sings a word like ""gold"" or ""river,"" you see the color and you can feel the water. Three words placed next to each other, like ""rock,"" ""bottom,"" and ""riser,"" the way he sings them, can tell a tiny story on their own, complete with a discernible arc. Performance and arrangements aside, <i>Rough Travel</i>, though not a ""greatest hits"" kind of set, affirms the authority of Callahan's songwriting. No wonder writers tend to love him.</p>
<p>Though Callahan's focus can come across as remote and stoic, he can also be playful. Take ""The Well"", for example. Much of the song focuses on the narrator's obsession with a single drop of water clinging to the edge of an old bucket perched at the top of an abandoned well. It's not much to hang a nine-minute song on, but Callahan imbues the image with drama and gets in some funny lines along the way. ""Everybody has their own thing that they yell into a well,"" he sings, one of those lines of his that makes you think, ""Yeah, that feels right."" And he puts some echo on his voice as he runs down his: a hoot, a ""Hello?"", and a ""Fuck all y'all.""</p>
<p>The instrumentation here is mostly acoustic, and the structure of the songs, including the traditional ""In the Pines"", which Callahan has covered on record and turned into something that feels like his own, lend a stately feel. But the songs are not easily bound to genre. Unlike his label-mate Will Oldham, whose loose rootsiness can lead to music that seems like it's drifting in from the past, Callahan's work seems of its time and makes you aware of the artist behind it. And <i>Rough Travel</i>, though ultimately only for established fans, turns out to be a very good snapshot of where that artist's music stood at the end of the last decade.</p></div>"|14135.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14135-rough-travel-for-a-rare-thing/|8.3|Mark Richardson

I'm sorry, but that's frankly hard to believe: The only jewelry he's wearing on the mixtape cover is a pair of handcuffs. Still, if that cover is to be believed, he has no trouble getting access to lobster, cell phones, and pink bottles of champagne while in prison. At no point do we learn how he opens bottles of pink champagne while he's got handcuffs on. It can't be easy.</p>
<p><i>The Burrrprint (2) </i>is the latest example of a long tradition: A rap album that comes out while the guy who made it is in jail. (And in this case, it really is an album rather than a mixtape, at least in the sense that his label is trying to rack up at least a couple of bucks by selling the damn thing in actual stores.) And while the bulk of the mixtape consists of tracks that Gucci recorded before starting his year-long parole-violation prison sentence, we still hear a whole lot of phoned-in missives from the imprisoned Gucci. He even recorded one song, ""Intro (Live From Fulton County Jail)"", from an actual prison phone. It's still very much a Gucci Mane song, not concerned with anything much deeper than his yellow Lamborghini with the butter rims. Even locked up, Gucci refuses to turn introspective. No matter what, he's determined to give us more cheap synthetic beats, more loopy word choices, more big choruses, more dizzy celebrations of materialistic pleasures. In other words, he's doing exactly the same shit he did before he went to prison. He's not even working out! ""No push-ups, but I'm still looking good as a motherfucker,"" he tells us.</p>
<p>As a straight-up Gucci mixtape, <i>The Burrrprint (2)</i> comes nowhere near the panache of its predecessor. The original <i>Burrrprint</i>, itself a sequel of Gucci's <i>The Movie</i> mixtape, was pretty much straight murder from end to end. On this one, though, filler abounds. Gucci's memorable punchlines come less often, and his choruses don't stick quite so easily. Gucci's cadences are less inventive, wheezier, more tired. Gucci's guest rappers are bigger stars than usual-- Ludacris, Rick Ross, Trey Songz-- but they add less than longtime collaborators like energetic mushmouth Wacka Flocka, who gets a couple of good moments. Considering the insane volume of material Gucci recorded before going to prison, it's pretty amazing that he wasn't on autopilot earlier, but it's still disappointing to hear him at something less than full speed.</p>
<p>But even when not at his best, Gucci continues to fascinate, partly because his voice has rap's best flattened-out party-dude bounce, and partly because you never know what kind of absurd word combinations he'll come up with next. (Some of my favorites from this one: ""Your girlfriend says my earrings are erotic,"" ""to a hood chick, Gucci's voice is euphoric,"" ""I got so much jewelry on that I think I need a clone."") ""Shining for No Apparent Reason"" has maybe the best Gucci song title ever. And some complete tracks are worthy entries in the Gucci canon, like the rumbling Ludacris collab ""Atlanta Zoo"" or the spare synth-whistle showcase ""Boy From the Block"". Best of all is the nine-minute posse cut ""Coca Coca"", on which Gucci rounds up six of his frequent collaborators (OJ Da Juiceman, Yo Gotti, Nicki Minaj, etc.) and takes every last one of them to school.</p>
<p>But the real takeaway from <i>The Burrrprint (2)</i> is that Gucci is going to continue to make these ecstatically ignorant bangers just as soon as he's able. ""Worst Enemy"", the closing track from Gucci's <i>The State Vs. Radric Davis</i> album, hinted at a more thoughtful and introspective Gucci, and that Gucci never returns here. Instead, any moments of reflection come almost by accident, as when he interrupts the brag-fest ""Do This Shit Again"": ""I got acquitted for murder, it was purely self-defense/ I hope they don't try to do that to me no more, don't wanna do that again/ Walking out my jail cell, don't wanna go through that shit again/ Thirty K at King of Diamonds, watch me throw that in the wind."" And <i>still</i> the image of bills floating through the air is what lingers. When Gucci gets back out of prison and returns to crafting images like that, it'll be a good day.</p></div>"|14144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14144-the-burrrprint-2/|6.4|Tom Breihan

He finally became prominent outside of niche circles when he joined Wilco last decade, and if there's any justice, he's finally reaping some long-elusive financial rewards for his music. Being in Wilco has slowed down his other musical output, but only insofar as he now doesn't release nine albums a year. You might expect a guy who's packed so much variety into his career to use each of his groups to focus on a different aspect of his craft; Cline has done that to some extent, but that's not how he uses the Nels Cline Singers. The long-running trio of Cline, bassist Devin Hoff, and drummer/et-ceterist Scott Amendola is sort of a brain-scraping catchall for Cline, and their records often seem like a concerted (and sometimes successful) effort to use lack of focus as an asset.</p>
<p>So of course, for a band with that M.O., the only thing better than a full disc of electronic rock-ish jazz is two of them. <i>Initiate</i> is split into a studio disc and a live disc, but both share similar sound quality and a manic tendency to swing wildly from one thought to another. The studio disc is considerably more layered, making greater use of a considerable array of electronic whirligigs to augment the band. Even within songs, it's unpredictable. ""Red Line to Greenland"" sounds like jazz until Cline's guitar comes in with a buzzing post-rock riff and the electronics start gasping and wheezing. ""Divining"" is perhaps the best illustration of the band's restlessness, morphing from contemplative jazz into a bizarre exotica number, with Cline singing wordlessly and multiplying his voice with processing. It's a sharp contrast to the delicate, complex leads he plays on the quiet, even pretty ""Grow Closer"" just a few tracks later.</p>
<p>Over on the live disc, the band seems to negotiate its set largely by feeling its way toward compositional signposts via listening to the other members. The flow is more discernibly jazz on most of the tracks, especially ""Fly Fly"", where Cline takes a series of alternately sinuous and thorny solos as Hoff and Amendola slip from straight rhythm to free time behind him. It's probably not a coincidence that Cline uses some very Sonic Youth-ish chord voicings on ""Thurston County""-- if <i>Daydream Nation</i> had been a jazz album, this is what it would have sounded like. Overall, the live disc has some of the rawness that the heavily overdubbed studio recordings of the Singers often lack, but it also wanders more and as such spends more time in unsatisfying places.</p>
<p>More than anything, <i>Initiate</i> shows a band whose sense of give and take and intuitive interplay is extremely well-developed. Cline is able to lead his compatriots just about anywhere his mind wants to wander, and they follow him with ease, whether he's merging Frippertronics with jazz, out-krautrocking Wilco, or bringing in David Witham to play a crazy, 1960s-tinged organ solo. Cline may never reach a larger audience working under his own name, but that doesn't seem to be his goal. He's reached a place where he can do his mutant thing to his heart's content, and the results are  exuberant, messy, and worth a couple of hours of your time.</p></div>"|14139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14139-initiate/|7.2|Joe Tangari

That's how I first reacted, struggling to find the same sort of entry points that its excellent 2009 predecessor, <i>Watersports</i>, offered. By contrast, <i>Steal Your Face</i> seemed too kinetic and overloaded to draw you in. It felt more focused on exploring the band's sounds than delivering a lasting impression.</p>
<p>Keep at it though: <i>Steal Your Face</i> is the sort of frantic, busy album that hides its hooks among fits of guitar savagery, dub textures, and ricocheting rhythms-- but only for so long. Mi Ami rips from the gates on opener ""Harmonics (Genius of Love)"", for instance. Singer Daniel Martin-McCormick stammers semi-intelligibly above a throbbing tom-tom beat <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6OGy57tmEY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(a pretty incredible music joke, given the title)</a> and a rusty guitar riff that splits the difference between post-punk, post-rock, and stoner metal. ""My body is so fucked, man, I just gotta move,"" he sings, while, appropriately, the band buries his words. It's as if Martin-McCormick is trying to find himself among the hot mess.</p>
<p>That's how the best of <i>Steal Your Face</i> works, by cramming every second with as many sounds and ideas as the trio can manage. Constant motion keeps the songs exciting, while the sense that there's always another layer you've yet to grasp is what recharges attention. On ""Secrets"", above a squealing guitar and a gut-punch bass, Martin-McCormick speaks volumes on bad drugs, guilty lust, and vacuous relationships, letting it all go in a curdling, 15-second scream that has the same effect as a sudden burst of harsh noise. Lined with Whitney Houston, Twitter, and white-guilt jokes, ""Latin Lover"" suggests the Fall finally looking good on the dance floor. And while it's possibly as straightforward as Mi Ami's ever been, ""Native Americans (Born in the U.S.A.)"" isn't an easy read, either: They march through six verses, pausing after each to restate a cooing hook or for Martin-McCormick to grind his guitar through the beat. The closing guitar solo-- 90 seconds of squeal and broken tones panning from speaker to speaker, fading only to reform-- feels like watching a street brawl.</p>
<p>Mi Ami's discursive and repetitive elements fortunately remain intact (just one tune clocks in at under five minutes), emphasized by the ""Dreamers"", the sole track here that couldn't be qualified as a rager. Martin-McCormick wraps his surprisingly muted whimper around trance-like rhythms and circular guitar. It's the third of the album's six tracks, meaning it's more of a chance for you to catch your breath than for the band to fade away. That's good, too, because Mi Ami seem only to be getting started: They've never been as good or as distinct as they are on <i>Steal Your Face</i>.</p></div>"|14140.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14140-steal-your-face/|8.1|Grayson Currin

Bobo's third album, <i>Sucker</i>,<i> </i>explain that these new songs were ""mostly written while courting an adventurous woman"" and following her around the world. ""The courtship was a success."" It's a great story with a happy ending, but it raises a crucial question: How will happiness, marriage, and fatherhood affect this boho Memphian's songs, which have historically veered toward the gloriously unhappy and unsettled? In documenting the ups and mostly the downs of romance, the eccentric singer-songwriter, who contributed string arrangements to Cat Power's <i>The Greatest </i>and has been known to wear painter's stilts onstage, typically picks himself as its favorite target and has never adhered to any one particular style for more than a song or two. Will contentment extinguish the spark from his music?</p>
<p>Not likely. It's a bumpy road to contentment, and Bobo chronicles it with insight and humor on <i>Sucker</i>, which may be short (just 29 minutes) but suggests a fully realized story that traces our sadsack narrator from the pits of despair to the heights of something like happiness. Opener ""Sweet Life"" refers not to what Bobo has, but what he aspires to: ""If I could be with you when you're down, if I could be more to you than a clown,"" he sings over trembling strings, ""you'd know life is sweet."" Indie pop rarely sounds so effortlessly stately. Things get worse before they get better, as Bobo drunk-dials a suicide note on the garage-raucous ""Crazy With Loneliness"" and bemoans his own advancing years on the folksily austere ""Old Man"" and the manic ""Hamster in a Cage"".</p>
<p>Even at his lowest, Bobo is never really a downer, perhaps because he views loneliness as some sort of cosmic joke or perhaps because musically he's all over the place. <i>Sucker</i> rambles between the manic swagger of ""Oh Boy"" and the sophisticated folk-pop of ""Errand Girl"", between the jaunty rag of ""Perfect Day"" and the spry double-entendres of ""Mlle. Chatte"" (which is only ostensibly about a housecat). At first that sprawling range comes across as an extension of his own eccentricities, as if he's being willfully unpredictable, but to his credit, a song's subject never dictates its style. There is no noticeable musical change when his lyrics stop evoking pain and start depicting desire and devotion. ""Energy"" and ""Bad Boyfriends"" chug with no less abandon, and ""Drank"" proves to be Bobo's most eloquent arrangement, meandering melodically as he recounts diving off a boat and nearly drowning in the ocean with that ""challenging woman""-- you don't need that soaring coda to know it's a love song. <i>Sucker </i>is an album about settling in but not settling down or, god forbid, simply settling, and Bobo's music reveals all the wanderlust left in him.</p></div>"|14133.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14133-sucker/|7.6|Stephen M.

In 2006, his self-titled EP introduced a singer with that familiar croak, a songwriter with a folk-revival revival sensibility, and a guitar player with an impressively agile fingerpicking style. The next year, his full-length debut, <i>Shallow Grave</i>, expanded nicely on those ideas, buffing away some of the rougher edges but emphasizing fully realized and beautifully evocative songs. <i>The Wild Hunt</i>, the second Tallest Man on Earth album and first for Dead Oceans, makes a few specific nods to Dylan at his most earnest and bare-- including a reference to ""boots of Spanish leather"" on ""King of Spain"". Ultimately, though, Matsson interprets Dylan, just as Dylan himself interpreted Guthrie. More to the point, Matsson translates him into the Scandinavian countryside, where he sings about changing seasons and quiet, lonely places far from cities. His lyrics are rough and often ragged, more concerned with evoking aching emotions than with making explicit sense. But that coded aspect only makes him sound more urgent, as if he's trying to convince you of something he couldn't possibly put into words.</p>
<p>As with previous albums, <i>The Wild Hunt</i> features mainly voice and guitar, and in this intimate, austere setting-- where the banjo on the title track sounds like an indulgence-- Matsson coaxes a wide range of colors from that limited palette, whether it's the testiness of ""You're Going Back"" or the exuberance of ""King of Spain"". His grounding in American Southern traditions is apparent: While not a blues musician per se, Matsson draws important lessons from the likes of Mississippi John Hurt and Bukka White by realizing that his guitar speaks as loudly and as clearly as he does.</p>
<p>His playing is sophisticated but never showy, alternating between spry picking and forceful strumming. Whether due to his tunings or his crisp production, there's something bright and expectant about his songs, so that even at his most forlorn, as on ""Love Is All"" or ""The Drying of the Law
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
ns"", Matsson's heraldic guitar playing generates a certain major-key hopefulness that softly shades the songs. When he switches to an old and battered piano on the teen anthem ""Kids on the Run"", the effect is not diminished but amplified, as the instrument reverberates uneasily. It's an unexpected moment that colors everything that came before it and paints Matsson as a distinctive and singular artist.</p>
<p>As a singer, he has become much more confident and capable, using that wily, deceptively limited croak with greater nuance and subtlety. The hiccup hook on ""Love Is All"" sounds like a joyful noise despite the song's tentative tone, and the rawness of his vocals lends gravity to the accusations of ""You're Going Back"". On the other hand, Matsson sounds warmly generous on ""Troubles Will Be Gone"" when he sings, ""The day is never done, still there's a light on where you sleep, so I hope someday your troubles will be gone."" Matsson is both a romantic and a realist, and on <i>The Wild Hunt</i>, he uses the barest of pop-folk settings to give mundane moments-- another break-up, another tour, another change of season, another Dylan comparison-- a grandeur so disproportional that it's difficult not to identify and sympathize with him.</p></div>"|14110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14110-the-wild-hunt/|8.5|Stephen M.

They started with a big bang, playing as noisy and abrasive as a band with structured rock songs could. Gradually, they stretched that approach, incorporating some space and restraint. The melodic skeletons beneath the music's cacophonous skin slowly poked through. By the time of their fourth studio album, <i>Arrived in Gold</i>, Sightings had mastered minimalism, sometimes exploring small, detailed sounds that were like the negative image of their white-hot noise.</p>
<p><i>City of Straw</i> opens with that kind of dark sparseness-- the first minute of ""Tar and Pine"" is all little clicks that sound more like Morse code than music. But when Mark Morgan's guitar slices through, and Jon Lockie's hybrid electro-acoustic drums lock in, the song becomes a tense, turgid combination of minimalist structure and maximalist sound. It's a mix the band perfected on their previous effort, 2007's <i>Through the Panama</i>, even producing a few catchy post-punk gems. <i>City of Straw </i>never quite hits that kind of head-bobbing snap, though it does offer a few songs you can pump your fists to. But the way it stirs the band's macro and micro sides together puts it squarely among their best efforts.</p>
<p>That mix also produces the album's strongest moments, both within single songs and through the juxtapositions of track sequencing. The contrasts are most vivid in a mid-album three-song stretch. The title track reiterates the tiny clips of ""Tar and Pine"", fusing them into nine minutes of buzzing sonics. The band's stubborn patience demands the same of the listener, but reward comes in the puncturing slam of ""Saccharine Traps"". There, a rumbling beat and Morgan's frantic howl (a contrast to the chilly vocal style he uses on most of the record) sound like Wolf Eyes trying to cover Joy Division. The switch from sparse to spastic is reexamined in the next cut, ""We All Amplify"", which might be the first dreamy Sightings track-- even Morgan's notoriously brittle guitar seems to soften a bit.</p>
<p>All the melting of echoey distance and full-on volume makes <i>City of Straw </i>a complex listen, but the album does contain a few bright, clear moments. On ""Weehawken"" and especially closer ""Sky Above Mud Below"", the band sculpts churning dissonance into rock shapes via Morgan's repetitive chants, Lockie's rolling rhythms, and the fluid bass of Richard Hoffman-- always the backbone of their sturdy attack. At this point those elements have become more like a language than a sound, a set of words and phrases that Sightings pour into song-molds like chemists concocting elixirs.</p></div>"|14134.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14134-city-of-straw/|7.9|Marc Masters

<p>Unlike the pair's previous efforts, <i>ForNever </i>feels less like a proper album than a collaborative airing of ideas, as both producer and MC breeze through beats and song concepts with a laid-back, Cali-minded approach. Unsurprisingly, <i>ForNever</i> is very much a California affair, with nearly every guest artist hailing from the Golden State (including album bookending features from Kurupt, far less dynamic here than he appeared on last year's collaboration with DJ Quik). From smoking kush on your momma's porch, hitting the 7-Eleven for chips and a Sprite, trying to convince your girl to wait until halftime to argue and getting in over your head with a porn star, each one of these little vignettes has a certain day-in-the-life appeal that work just fine as individual concepts. String them together and you might as well be listening to a treatment for the next <i>Friday</i> installment. Succeeding at their most humorous (including ""Let Me Talk"", which features some hilarious insight from the pimp-wise Suga Free), most of the songs are toss-offs, but it's plenty of fun to be along for the ride as long as some restraint is issued. Without it, <i>ForNever</i> alternately struggles to keep its head above water with washed-out cautionary tales (""The Problem Is..."") or slums it in the shallows with mildly tawdry goofs (""Asian Girl"").</p>
<p>If Murs weren't keeping so busy (with everything from comic books to a collaboration with members of Bad Brains in the pipeline), <i>ForNever</i> could feel slight. But even ignoring those greater ambitions, it's just good to find him in encouraging company that, above all else, at least has the rapper feeling comfortable again-- a crucial look for a guy like Murs. And even if these ideas haven't been given much time to fully form, it's hard to feel totally cheated: <i>ForNever</i> is simple fun, and fun while it lasts. As Murs asks on the opening title track, ""We do it for love, what the fuck you makin' music for?"" It's further proof that a lot of good can come from simply making sure your heart is in the right place.</p></div>"|14108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14108-fornever/|6.1|Zach Kelly

Blending the insinuating samba of her homeland with folktronic sensibilities, Cibelle collaborated with Seu Jorge and Devendra Banhart, and covered songs by Tom Waits and Caetano Veloso. Now, Cibelle is through being cool. Her latest effort, <i>Las Vênus Resort Palace Hotel</i>, pays tribute to the untrendy sounds of exotica, the orchestrally ornate lounge genre that brought 1950s suburbanites a bastardized version of world music rhythms and instrumentation.</p>
<p>Cibelle is an engaging, self-aware performer, and her rationale for honoring exotica is ""to embrace my exoticness and push it to the next level, and incorporate all that is considered ugly and cheesy and vulgar."" Her aim is provocative; it's brave to search for truth and beauty in the stylized, often tacky approximations outsiders have made of your culture. It also forces the listener to consider how his or her conception of ""cool"" shapes the listening experience. (As if that wasn't enough context, <i>Las Vênus</i> is also a concept album about a band performing at the last nightclub on Earth, complete with a metaphorically canny love story involving an ""outsider"" from space falling for Cibelle's ""exotic"" alter ego, Sonja Khalecallon.)</p>
<p>Now, if only the music matched the cultural critique. Cibelle may claim that any listener's dissatisfaction only proves her point about the slavish devotion to cool, but I don't think that's the culprit. The problem is that Cibelle is not a particularly strong melodist; her stellar skills as a colorist masked this deficiency on the subtle <i>Electric Leaves</i>, but the broad strokes of <i>Las Vênus</i> leave her with nowhere to hide. ""Braid My Hair"" and ""Mr. and Mrs. Grey"" are more madcap than memorable, while the garage rave-up ""Escute Bem"" comes off as second-rate Tarantino soundtrack fodder (as does the mariachi murder ballad ""The Gun and the Knife"").</p>
<p>Of the Cibelle-penned songs, only the gorgeous, light-as-a-feather ""Frankenstein"" is wholly successful, though ""Sapato Azul"" boasts a terrifically slinky bassline. The covers fare better: Raymond Scott's ""Lightworks"", a lovely reading of the Muppets standard ""It's Not Easy Being Green"", and a take on the kitschy <i>Dr. No</i> soundtrack relic, ""Underneath the Mango Tree"". In this latter instance, Cibelle takes cloyingly ""ethnic"" source material and turns it into something seductive and even beautiful. It's the apotheosis of her project-- there just aren't enough moments like it.</p></div>"|14130.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14130-las-venus-resort-palace-hotel/|5.0|Joshua Love

The quartet is based in Cardiff, Wales, and their bilingual music puts a whimsical spin on UK traditions ranging from music hall and psychedelia to glam rock and post-punk. So any discussion of Race Horses will inevitably lead back to equally warped Welsh forbears like Gorky's Zygotic Mynci and Super Furry Animals. But with Gorky's having disbanded in 2006, and the Super Furries continuing to mutate far beyond their psych-pop origins, it's more constructive to view Race Horses not as imitators but as rightful heirs to the Welsh Class-of-1996 legacy. Their wonderful debut album, <i>Goodbye Falkenburg</i>, certainly proves they're up to the task.</p>
<p>What's most striking about the record is that Race Horses never let their grandiose ambitions get in the way of energy and urgency. The album's sonic accoutrements-- reversed guitar solos, toreador trumpets, radio static, phaser effects-- propel the songs along rather than weigh them down. Race Horses could not be a more aptly named group: <i>Goodbye Falkenburg</i> charges out of the gate with three of its most engaging tracks, instantly establishing the band's sly, cheeky sense of humor: the suggestive boy-meets-girl courtship of ""Cake"" climaxes with a simple, innocent request for the titular dessert, and when frontman Meilyr Jones says he wants to be a ""pony"" on the Roxy Music-styled track of the same name, he's not owning up to some escapist fantasy so much as calling himself an ass (""I want to be the one to sit beside you/ I want to be the one you lie to"").</p>
<p>By stacking the most obvious singles up front, Race Horses ease you into <i>Goodbye Falkenburg</i>'s more bizarro turns. Even though it barely breaches the three-minute mark, ""Cacen Mamgu"" presents a bewilderingly frantic procession of glitter-rock riffs, stop-start change-ups, backward-loop effects and Welsh football chants. But perhaps not wanting to add another layer of inscrutability to <i>Falkenburg</i>'s more cluttered compositions, Jones generally saves his Welsh-language performances for the album's most straight-faced and affecting moments-- in particular ""Glo Ac Oren"", a gorgeous, Gorky's-esque piano ballad that showcases Race Horses' songwriting fortitude in the absence of their usual studio trickery or campy delivery.</p>
<p>When they first emerged in the mid 90s, Gorky's and the Super Furries were unfairly lumped in and/or judged against the dominant Britpop of the day-- and often written off as wackaloon eccentrics as a result. But Race Horses have emerged in more favorable circumstances, with spiritual kin like Wild Beasts and Los Campesinos! already bending ears on both sides of the Atlantic toward flamboyant and erudite UK art-pop. With any luck, Race Horses will score the victory lap for this absurdity-is-the-new-sincerity movement.</p></div>"|14128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14128-goodbye-falkenburg/|8.0|Stuart Berman

Because the Stooges heard on <i>Raw Power </i>were not the same band that produced 1969's self-titled debut or 1970's <i>Funhouse</i>, but rather some mutant, zombie version. With the Stooges dropped from Elektra, Iggy exploited a solo-artist deal with David Bowie's management to reassemble his band around new guitarist James Williamson, pushing Ron Asheton to bass and re-branding the Stooges as ""Iggy &amp; the Stooges"". And in accordance with those changes, Bowie's infamously treble-heavy <i>Raw Power</i> mix thrust Iggy's vocals and Williamson's searing solos miles out in front of the rhythm section, to the point of practically writing Ron and drummer/brother Scott Asheton out of the set.</p>
<p>All of which has made <i>Raw Power </i>the most contentious release in the Stooges catalog, a fact that Iggy himself effectively owned up to in 1997 when he issued an exponentially louder and beefier new mix that took the album's title to literal extremes (and, in the process, horrified audiophiles with a distaste for digital distortion). It speaks volumes about the songs' pure immediacy and charisma that, even in its original mix, <i>Raw Power</i> became the album most responsible for giving the Stooges a life after death. Where the primordial caveman blues of <i>The Stooges </i>and the proto-metallic grind of <i>Funhouse </i>made them touchstones for future grunge, stoner-rock, and noise artists, <i>Raw Power</i> provided a mainline for first-generation punks and the 80s hard-rockers that followed in their wake. (Case in point: When J Mascis and Mike Watt hooked up with Ron Asheton for some 2001 dates, they only performed songs from the first two Stooges albums; when Guns N' Roses and the Red Hot Chili Peppers covered the Stooges, they did songs from <i>Raw Power</i>.)</p>
<p>There's no denying that the <i>Raw Power</i> era was the band's most prolific: the album's eight songs account for just a fraction of the music Iggy &amp; the Stooges produced between their 1972 reformation and their unceremonious 1974 dissolution. Over the past three decades, the number of bootlegs that have attempted to collect all the unreleased material from this period-- from the <i>Rough Power </i>comp of de-Bowie-fied mixes to the notorious last-gig document <i>Metallic K.O.</i>-- have amounted to a mini-cottage industry that's been as vital to sustaining the band's legend as their four official releases.</p>
<p>So, for an album that runs a mere 33 minutes, <i>Raw Power</i> should provide ample fodder for deluxe-reissue treatment and an opportunity to streamline all that bootlegged ephemera into an official storehouse of all the songs the Stooges produced between 1972-74. However, this reissue-- available in a 2xCD, budget-priced Legacy Edtion set and as a more elaborate $60 4xCD Deluxe Edition-- doesn't attempt anything quite so ambitious. Instead, the main impetus is bringing a remastered version of the original Bowie mix back to market. This is understandable from an historical-preservation perspective, but then why not also include the '97 mix and allow fans to compare and contrast?</p>
<p>The new remaster certainly enhances the ambient details in the mix-- like  the tense acoustic underpinning of ""Gimme Danger"", or the echoing beat in ""I Need Somebody"" that illustrates Bowie's intention of making Scott Asheton's drums sound like a lumberjack chopping wood. But, personally, after spending the past 13 years having my ears ravaged by the '97 Iggy mix, I find it difficult readjusting to the leaner, original version-- even with the remastering, the '97 version far outstrips it in fidelity and sheer brute force, and remains a better entry point for younger listeners seeking to understand the album's impact.</p>
<p>Still, even if you've already bought this album twice, the Legacy Edition's second disc offers a compelling reason to shell out again: an immensely entertaining, well-preserved 1973 Atlanta club set that was intended for a radio broadcast but later aborted. Recorded months after <i>Raw Power</i> had been released, ignored, and consigned to cut-out bins, the set sees the Stooges in another transitory state, further asserting <i>Raw Power'</i>s 50s-rock roots with the addition of jaunty pianist Scott Thurston, but also patiently stretching out new songs like ""Head On"" and ""Heavy Liquid"" into loose, exploratory, Who-style workouts. It also unintentionally redresses <i>Raw Power</i>'s initial imbalance by smothering Williamson's leads in the Ashetons' thick low-end. Naturally, the combination of Iggy and a crowd of southerners results in some colorful exchanges (""You wanna get your little fucking face punched out, little cracker boy?""), and it's fun to revisit a moment when the Stooges' audience was sparse enough to make out individual conversations (says one spectator: ""I don't think he likes us!""). But more than a document of Iggy in his audience-baiting element, the set serves as a great tribute to the late Ron Asheton, whose bass-playing is finally revealed to be every bit as fierce and inventive as his guitar-playing.</p>
<p>The live disc is appended with two <i>Raw Power</i> outtakes-- a more compact, studio version of ""Head On"" and the silly rumble-in-the-jungle jam ""Doojiman""-- but anyone hoping for more vault-clearing revelations on the expanded 4xCD Deluxe Edition (available exclusively through <a href=""http://www.iggyandthestoogesmusic.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.iggyandthestoogesmusic.com</a>) will be disappointed. The ""Rarities, Outtakes and Alternates"" disc seems especially ill-conceived, padding out its few genuine finds (an amusing, embryonic version of ""Penetration"" dubbed ""I'm Hungry"", and the Velvets-via-Hendrix goof ""Hey Peter"") with a random assemblage of alternate mixes (including a pair of 1997 representatives) and an incomplete sampling of the era's well-known outtakes (""I Got a Right"" and ""I'm Sick of You"" are accounted for, so where the hell's ""Gimme Some Skin""?).</p>
<p>Easy Action's 2005 bootleg box-set, <i>Heavy Liquid</i>, did a far more thorough job of compiling the <i>Raw Power</i>-era castaways, so Stooges completists investing in this Deluxe Edition will need to be satiated by the non-musical extras: a replica Japanese ""Search and Destroy"" b/w ""Raw Power"" seven-inch, 48-page book (filled with celebrity testimonials and Mick Rock's iconic period photography), five 5x7"" photographic prints, and, most valuably, a DVD documentary about the album's creation by Morgan Neville. Comprising recent interviews with the surviving Stooges and famous fans like Johnny Marr, Chrissie Hynde, and Henry Rollins, the doc covers all the main album talking points and offers a memorable moment of candor when Iggy admits to feeling vindicated that the Stooges still have such vitality and relevance today. There was certainly no lack of irony and cheek when Iggy first sung ""we're going down in history"" on <i>Raw Power</i>'s kamikaze closer ""Death Trip"", but watching the closing shots of Iggy &amp; the Stooges performing for a Brazilian festival crowd last year, with Mike Watt inheriting Ron Asheton's mantle, those words now sound more assuredly prophetic than ever.</p></div>"|14125.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14125-raw-power-legacy-edition-raw-power-deluxe-edition/|8.3|Stuart Berman

In fact, he's been sort of hard to avoid for anyone with even a cursory interest in a Scandinavian electronic scene populated by artists like Rune Lindbæk, diskJokke, and Todd Terje. When Thomas' eponymous debut was announced abruptly in February, there was a sense of inevitability-- a coming-out party for one of nu-disco's premier names. <i>Prins Thomas</i>, however, is a bit of a curveball, one that moves away from most definitions of ""dance"" music toward a wilier sound inspired by 1970s German music and avant-garde composition.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about <i>Prins Thomas</i> is that it's slow, or at least reserved. Thomas has been mining krautrock legends like Cluster, Neu!, and solo works by Michael Rother and Manuel Göttsching. (No surprise-- one of Thomas' only proper tracks prior to this release was named ""Göttsching"".) His highest profile gig to-date has been working with fellow Norwegian Lindstrøm, with last year's collaboration, <i>II</i>, digging hard into fried instrumental jams. <i>Prins Thomas</i> came together quickly after mixing for <i>II</i> ended, and it's cut from the same cloth: slow grooves that leave room for guitars, keyboards, and sometimes vocals to voyage skyward.</p>
<p>These expeditions can be thrilling and impressive, but <i>Prins Thomas</i> often fails to establish any discernible mood; the album is not effusive or downcast, never giddy or stoic. It feels, at times, academic, which is a product of its well-worn influences but also Thomas' sturdy, uneventful pacing. The longest track here, ""Sauerkraut"", references its influences in both its title and its composition, speeding up the bassline from Neu!'s seminal ""Negativland"".  <i>Prins Thomas</i> sometimes feels like the work of a fan, a <i>study</i>.</p>
<p>Of course Thomas is much more than just a fan, and he's smart enough to know that he needn't assign too much importance to an album, even his first: In an <a href=""http://www.beatportal.com/feed/item/album-of-the-week-prins-thomas-prins-thomas/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with Beatportal (conducted by Pitchfork contributor Philip Sherburne) he refers to <i>Prins Thomas</i> as a ""snapshot."" He openly frets about his musical ability while name-checking the legends. It's safe to say that an artist who spent 10 years collaborating in a close-knit scene before dropping his debut has healthily non-traditional attitudes about a career in music. In turn, it's best to think of <i>Prins Thomas</i> not as a speedbump but as another iteration, slightly undercooked, of his still-developing style.</p></div>"|14124.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14124-prins-thomas/|6.3|Andrew Gaerig

No halfway-to-great songs at all, actually.</p>
<p>Now, this isn't a <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> situation. Priestess isn't a band out there blazing paths. Instead, they play the sort of fast, crunching <span class=""misspell"">stoner</span>-metal that <span class=""misspell"">Motörhead</span> and first-album Black Sabbath pioneered and that a few thousand bands have attempted to perfect ever since. What made them special was their way with a hook. <i>Hello Master</i> sounded at first like an easy album to dismiss; it did <i>absolutely nothing</i> new. But tracks like the<i> Guitar Hero III</i> jam ""Lay Down"" stuck with you. The band <span class=""misspell"">might've</span> been doing stuff <span class=""misspell"">that'd</span> already been done to death, but they did it <i>really well</i>, with swagger and assurance and craft. Flash forward a few years, and Priestess are a seasoned touring act, and a couple of their members have grown seriously <span class=""misspell"">badass</span> biker beards. But they've evidently lost their ear for sticky, soaring melodies. <i>P</i><i>rior to the Fire </i>is a perfectly acceptable retro-metal album, every part in place. But there's nothing exceptional about it-- and nothing here for anyone not already a fan of retro-metal.</p>
<p>That said, if 70s guitar-thunder is your thing, there's plenty to like here. Drummer Vince <span class=""misspell"">Nudo</span> keeps things moving admirably, throwing in all sorts of <span class=""misspell"">berserker</span> fills where other guys would've been content to smack a cowbell a couple of times. <span class=""misspell"">Heppner</span> has a great metal voice, a vaguely scraggly wail that comes off, at times, like a less-destroyed version of Lemmy's growl. The lyrics are fun: stuff about ""the forest of my soul,"" ""scum-filled city streets afraid,"" a priceless bit about how <span class=""misspell"">Heppner</span> is ""like a skull with no eyes"" because, it emerges, you're gone. The album is beautifully mastered, so that the quiet acoustic bits actually sound quieter than the loud ones; especially for a metal album originally recorded for a major, that's a rare thing.</p>
<p>So if <i>Prior to the Fire</i> does make its way onto your <span class=""misspell"">iPod</span>, you probably won't hit skip when its songs come up on shuffle, especially if you're already invested in this kind of thing. But when you hold it up to something great in the same vein, like High on Fire's masterful new <i>Snakes for the Divine</i>, it suffers. That album is the sound of a band at the peak of its powers, dropping bombs for the fuck of it. But <i>Prior to the Fire</i> just sounds like a competent, professional band running through the motions. The album has no grand arc; it's just a collection of pretty okay jams for people who already own everything Pentagram ever recorded. It's fine, but it's nothing more than fine.</p></div>"|14129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14129-prior-to-the-fire/|5.9|Tom Breihan

First, and most importantly, it's seen as an exciting extension of the various styles that have been swirling around the genre for the past few years-- specifically wonky and funky. The record also arrives with some cachet: It's only the fifth long player to be released by Hyperdub, still the genre's standard-bearer and the source of some of its most essential music. Ikonika's (real name Sara Abdel-Hamid) record is also one of the first high-profile dubstep full-lengths produced by a woman, and though that's moot with regard to her actual music, it's at least encouraging for what has been a mostly male-dominated scene so far.</p>
<p>Ikonika isn't the most musical or technical producer out there, but she does have a way with melody. In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/grime-dubstep/7778-grime-dubstep/"" target=""_blank"">an interview</a> with Pitchfork columnist Martin Clark, she told us, ""I don't really know how to play keys. So I just smack them until something nice comes out."" Okay, probably not the best defense of one's own work, but it is important to understanding how she differs from other dubstep producers. Instead of the meticulous, heady style that we've come to expect from the genre, Ikonika's approach is more spontaneous and direct, concerned more with impact than process. Her productions aren't as dynamic or complex as others' are, but they're arguably <i>fun</i> in a way that a lot of dubstep-- especially the traditional murky, low-end variety-- is not.</p>
<p>In terms of sound, Ikonika isn't that different from producers Joker, Rustie, and Starkey. Like them, she uses dubstep as a base for a jumble of styles-- in this case the wobble of wonky, the insistent thud of funky, and chiptune videogame sounds. Her pitch-bent synths are usually the focus-- they sit upfront in the mix and are manipulated to match a song's mood. Sometimes the album can feel almost cloyingly upbeat (there's a lot of very ramped-up, tech-y sounds) but there's also a good deal of variety. ""R.E.S.O.L."" nearly makes you woozy with its heavy, wobbling bass and distorted 8-bit squiggle. Videogames are a running theme, and certain tracks like ""They Are Losing the War"" <i>really</i> play up this quality. Others, like ""Millie"" are more slow-moving and syrupy.</p>
<p>Because of these distinct moods, the record works nicely as a full length-- it holds your attention, and the songs never bleed together. For those not expecting progressive dubstep, it's a catchy, immediate pleasure. But others who desire something heavy on craft, depth, and movement might find it insufficient. The record lacks some of those critical elements, but ultimately it's neither a great crossover dubstep-pop LP nor some kind of crude flop. It's a solid record. If nothing else, Ikonika's desire to inject some playfulness into a genre that could use a lot more of it is a good and welcome thing.</p></div>"|14131.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14131-contact-love-want-have/|7.0|Joe Colly

These two Florida youngsters are shedding influences and playing to strengths. They're also smartly packaging their ideas at an unusually brisk pace-- their <i>Wooden Blankets</i> EP arrives less than a year after their debut, <i>Season Dreaming</i>. They'd still do well to match their shimmering synth-pop textures with a more dazzling group of tunes, but their hues have intensified and their patterns grown more complex, which counts as significant progress for a fresh-faced ambient-pop band such as this.</p>
<p>Of course, my colleague Joe Colly's assertion in his review of <i>Season Dreaming</i> that BMC ""owes everything to Animal Collective"" still has more than a ring of truth to it. The songs on <i>Wooden Blankets</i> are all enveloped in a damp murk, a sharp contrast from <i>Season Dreaming</i>'s sunkissed feel; the effect is not unlike <i>Strawberry Jam</i>'s fizzy ""#1"", and just as with the AC track, tunes here take a backseat to texture. But they've opted to trade <i>Feels</i>-era shiftiness for a mellower, sparkly <i>Person Pitch</i> pastiche, and the resulting textures are richer, more vivid, and far prettier. There's evidence of a few more trips to the record store, too; the synths have a blocky Brian Eno quality, the drift floats like spacey <i>Phaedra</i>-era Tangerine Dream, and the alternately swooping and soporific vocals smack of Frog Eyes' Carey Mercer and Deerhunter's Bradford Cox, respectively.</p>
<p>The challenge BMC still don't seem quite up to is matching these impressive textures to songs you can carry with you once they're finished-- something most of their influences took years to manage. These melodies don't put up much of a fight through the dense haze on display here, and when they do-- as on mantra-like closer ""Sleeping Bag""-- they lose much of the sonic richness that seems at the moment like their best asset. That balance between tune and texture isn't an easy one to strike, and they still need to work on the former; these songs do feel more distinctly theirs, but they still don't quite have the gestures of songwriting down well enough to get away with being quite this gestural as songsmiths, and no amount of sonic wallpapering can cover over the holes in these tunes. But <i>Wooden Blankets</i> is a series of small successes, with evidence of progress and promise; they may still have a ways to go, but it's plain as day which way they're headed.</p></div>"|14132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14132-wooden-blankets-ep/|6.4|Paul Thompson

Before he was any of that, though, he was a Texan. Sources vary on where he was born-- some say Dallas, others Austin-- but he has spent virtually all his life in the Lone Star State. That's crucial, not simply because Texas breeds a particularly prickly form of artist-- from Lightnin' Hopkins to Townes Van Zandt to Eagle Pennell-- but primarily because its artists tend to fiddle around with form and style, throwing together sounds and genres almost haphazardly. So, as a Texas musician, Erickson is by nature a synthesist, and even his earliest recordings with the 13th Floor Elevators exhibit an intuitive mix of blues, rock, psych, country, soul, and prayer. As his career has progressed, he has settled into that station comfortably, so that he now has more in common with Doug Sahm, ZZ Top, and even the Butthole Surfers (who have all worked with him over the decades) than with any of his 1960s psych-rock peers.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that Erickson would partner up with Okkervil River for his first album in 15 years: Even though they've been branded broadly indie and have never been especially identified with their hometown of Austin, the band understands his origins and how they inform and even define his music. Will Sheff culled the dozen songs on <i>True Love Cast Out All Evil </i>from more than 60 that Erickson had written over the last four decades, then fashioned them into a setlist that emphasizes biography and breadth. Okkervil River back him like an especially erudite bar band, which allows them to indulge his every whim and mood and which emphasizes his songwriting range. As a result, the album repositions Erickson's psych rock as the foundation for a diverse sound that spans the Byrdsian riffs on ""Bring Back the Past"", warped folk of ""Ain't Blues Too Sad"", and garage-rock bluster of ""John Lawman"".</p>
<p>For his part, Erickson sounds better than he has in decades: His voice retains a lot of its growl and grit, but remarkably, the man who gave ""You're Gonna Miss Me"" it madman edge sounds absolutely convincing baring his soul and pleading for his life on ""Please, Judge"". He comes across as more relaxed, more confident, more lively in his vocals, especially on the dignified country number ""Be and Bring Me Home"". Just as Okkervil River's smarts give them the range to back him, Erickson's eccentricities have created a huge sentimental streak. Newcomers who pick up this album might find his lyrics a bit precious-- especially when he sings, ""I won't jump on you/ Though we are all rubber""-- but these songs are clearly and inventively anchored in an unassuming, enormously uncynical perspective. Ultimately, his words can't help but coalesce into a detailed portrait of a man whose trials have made him hold his family, his friends, and his life all the more dearly.</p>
<p>The urge with musicians like Erickson-- or like Syd Barrett, Skip Spence, Daniel Johnston, Nick Drake, or anyone with a tragic past-- is to hang their reputations on their pained histories rather than on their musical accomplishments. At times Sheff seems to be making too much of Erickson's biography, especially when he interrupts ""Please, Judge"" with a crescendoing cacophony of found sounds taken from old home videos or recorded at the Rusk State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where Erickson served for drug possession. It's meant to refer not only to that sad chapter, but also to Erickson's schizophrenia, which caused him to blast televisions and videos to drown out the voices in his head. Crafting those artifacts into a sonic element is more of an academic idea than a musical one, and as such it feels somewhat exploitive, as if too caught up in the past to see the healthier present. Sheff wants to present Erickson as both a rock legend and a real human being, but Erickson just wants to sing. On this affecting and ultimately triumphant album, Erickson comes out on top.</p></div>"|14120.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14120-true-love-cast-out-all-evil/|7.4|Stephen M. Deusner

Previous release <i>Fate</i> seemed to be a step in the right direction-- cleaner production, more attention paid to songwriting instead of bland jamming-- but the songs still registered as lazy and reheated in an uncomfortably boring way. So it's a pleasant surprise that after a gruelingly long run of dry, indistinguishable material, Dr. Dog have produced a record that shakes off (most of) their pallid Beatles-borrowing and embraces a bigger, more charismatic sound.</p>
<p><i>Shame, Shame</i> is arguably the band's finest moment. As if working in reverse, the band is finally making terse, jaunty chamber-pop and folk-inflected rock collages that would suggest the work of a younger, wide-eyed outfit. Perhaps thanks to pal Jim James from My Morning Jacket (who lends a hand on the title track here), Dr. Dog are digging deeper into their rootsier leanings, taking cues from the Band and CSNY. The songs are best at their springiest, with ragtime-y pianos, blooming back-up harmonies, and a healthy injection of 70s AM gold. Where previously resigned to the same kind of middling, simple constructions that often just glazed over, <i>Shame, Shame</i>'s highlights burst into full color: tracks like ""Where'd All the Time Go"", a euphoric farmhouse jam that suggests the Flaming Lips at their most anthemic, distract from the occasional lapse into circuitous ho-hummery.</p>
<p>Dr. Dog still aren't the most inventive band in the world, lyrically characterless and often prone to plow into their influences so forcefully it's almost uncivilized. And depending where you are in proximity to your first cup of coffee today, portions of <i>Shame, Shame</i> might prove to be just a little too effervescent-- certainly not a bad thing for a band with a track record that usually ran contrary. The important thing is that these songs hit more than they miss, occasionally with shimmering resolve and a couple of really big choruses to back it all up, often quite memorably. Finally, some work from a veteran band that is actually starting to act like one.</p></div>"|14089.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14089-shame-shame/|6.7|Zach Kelly

Fehlmann composed music for the project separately from fellow musical contributor Maurus Ronner, and much of Fehlmann's work didn't make the documentary.  So the re-edited and refined material presented here is more of an imagined soundtrack than a definitive one, even though a few of its tracks make regular appearances throughout the series.</p>
<p>Due to its cut-and-paste nature, <i>Gute Luft</i> lacks the sonic uniformity of previous Fehlmann releases, especially 2007's luxurious career-high <i>Honigpumpe</i>; this absence of a defining musical idea, where sounds and moods range from Detroit techno's insistent thump to  post-rock drone to ambient drift to spacey dub, when coupled with the record's 70-minute runtime, is at first overwhelming. But the big-tent approach also connects the music to the film that inspired it, Berlin being a cosmopolition and culturally diverse city.</p>
<p><i>Gute Luft</i> works as a survey of everything Fehlmann does well. He's stated that while putting the album together, he ""brought in elements from tunes from my previous albums,"" and anyone with a working knowledge of his solo work (not to mention his contributions to the Orb) will recognize where he's drawing from. The spiraling build of opener ""Alles, Immer"" and the more amorphous ""Von Oben"" recall <i>Honigpumpe</i>'s epic-stuffed back half, while the hiccupped tones and static wash of ""Berliner Luftikus"" resembles that record's swampy front end.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the glitchy, funk-strewn tech-house of 2004's <i>Lowflow</i> is distantly echoed in the jittery ""Cityscape"", while the shimmering piano that closes out ""Permanent Touch"" directly lifts the same figure that opens one of Fehlmann's more notable achievements with the Orb, 2005's <i>Okie Dokie It's the Orb on Kompakt</i>. The most obvious forebear throughout <i>Gute Left</i> is Fehlmann's groove-heavy Kompakt debut, 2002's <i>Visions of Blah</i>, from the circular beats on ""Wasser im Fluss"" (and its counterpart, ""Fluss im Wasser"") to the heady, laser-guided highs of ""Permanent Touch"". The most arresting moments come when Fehlmann explores post-rock's  cinematic terrain. ""Darkspark"" menacingly drones with a booming thud,  while the minimalist blips that open ""Falling into Your Eyes"" dissolve  into mournful horns and stretched-out orchestral sighs.</p>
<p>These sounds are nothing new for anyone with a passing familiarity with Fehlmann's catalog, but when they're executed by someone with his ear and sense of structure, the results still feel fresh. Even the ostensibly incidental music here rewards close attention, and the whole is striking enough to make you wonder which direction Fehlmann will take next.</p></div>"|14081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14081-gute-luft/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

Though <i>Heart That’s Pounding</i> is the first collection she's released under her own name (she was born Sally Russell, but took the surname of the Avalanches' Darren Seltmann when they married), she created two albums, 2005's <i>Last Beautiful Day</i> and 2007's <i>Somewhere, Anywhere</i>, as New Buffalo for Arts &amp; Crafts. She also co-wrote a little song called ""1234"" that she gave to her friend and labelmate Feist. Through ""1234"" and her own work, Seltmann has helped architect a specific strain of MOR indie-- slightly quirky songs with perky chamber arrangements or glitchy electronic shading to add depth to its acoustic backbone. By finally dropping New Buffalo in favor of her own name, she is possibly leading with her songwriting credits more than her previous records</p>
<p>Seltmann isn't a powerful singer, but her breathy, dainty voice is well-matched to slight, shivery melodies bulked up with silvery synths or swooning piano. Album opener ""Harmony to My Heartbeat"" fills the space between her spare, calliope-like melodies with peppy handclaps and a foundation of programmed-raindrop percussion. It's sparse twitchiness recalls bedroom electro-pop, but with sunnier, more expansive aims. But it's hard to walk the tightrope between hushed, poignant, electro-inflected pop ballads and mawkish lite-FM fodder, and Seltmann's songs can have trouble maintaining that balancing act. ""The Truth"" errs on the side of over-sentimentality with its gooey Karen Carpenter vocals. And on ""Over the Borderline"" Seltmann tries her hand at the kind of uplifting, this-is-a-new-day anthem that the Polyphonic Spree usually traffic in, and her bald-faced optimism is difficult to take with a straight face.</p>
<p>Parts of the album are guaranteed to give you a toothache, but it's the most overly saccharine songs that may appeal to satellite radio programmers
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
and licensing supervisors, and thus be Seltmann's ticket to name recognition. And, in fact, that is the lasting result of ""1234""'s success. Combining charming melodies, a wistful coo, and interesting-enough flourishes, these kind of unabashedly emotional, purposefully eccentric tracks are shorthand for a certain kind of hipster love affair. That is not Seltmann's fault, but it may be her legacy.</p></div>"|14109.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14109-heart-thats-pounding/|6.4|Rebecca Raber

Berliners Stefan Schneider and Ronald and Robert Lippok often sound as balanced and precise as their reversible band name. But they know how to finesse electronic timbres and human melodies, neither over-intellectualizing nor over-sentimentalizing their songs. What makes <i>Speculation</i> so welcome is that it represents a tweak to their established M.O. nearly 15 years into their career.</p>
<p>Recording sessions for <i>Speculation</i>,<i> </i>some of which were held in the rural studio of Krautrock legends Faust, succeeded in capturing a more live sound and looser atmosphere. Previous tracks have always been well composed. New ones like ""Working Against Time"" add bright cosmic rhythms and a sense of immediacy to the mix, as if you can feel the air move in the room between the synths and guitars. That song in particular has a swagger to it; synths pulse against a persistent beat, as if in reference to the title. Credit Stefan Schneider's bass playing with plenty of propulsion and muscle, especially the dark, skuzzy tone on ""Away"" or the bouncy middle section of ""Seele"".</p>
<p><i>Hotel Morgen</i>, the trio's previous record, wasn't nearly as energetic; momentum was sometimes slow to establish itself (and quick to fade) and the short closer, ""Opak"", was an awkward send-off. <i>Speculation</i> sounds much tighter, confidently moving between tracks and themes. The digital tones the band has been playing with for years sound richer yet also lighter, supporting soaring cyclical melodies.</p>
<p>The growing sense of looseness culminates in the epic, nearly 11-minute jam ""Friday"", which includes the mad organ playing of Faust's Jochen Irmler fiddling away on a homemade instrument. It's relatively unhinged for the group, yet they keep pace, enriching this particular freakout with bubbling cauldrons of noise, brusque tones and beats. It never quite boils over, as if the group's cool, calm hand still has sway. The music of To Rococo Rot has always had an organic element; <i>Speculation</i> furthers that with a real sense of play and exploration.</p></div>"|14119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14119-speculation/|7.6|Patrick Sisson

No such moments exist on <i>Congratulations</i>. Hell, there aren't even failed attempts at replicating those songs here. This time out, MGMT aren't crafting pop; they're Creating Art. The problem is that many of the half-million or so people who bought their debut, <i>Oracular Spectacular</i>, just want a couple catchy-as-fuck, ear-candy singles to blast in their cars or put on with their friends.</p>
<p>One possible response to <i>Congratulations</i> is that MGMT are having a real ""time to pretend"" moment-- that they're willfully being weird, and either shrinking from the challenge of repeating their crossover success or clumsily aiming to prove their underground cred. But the simplest answer seems most realistic: MGMT are being themselves. Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden wrote and released ""Time to Pretend"" and ""Kids"" way back in 2005. With a major-label contract in hand, they've never again written anything so radio-friendly. Instead, they penned the headier and exploratory (and weaker) parts of their debut album with help from go-to bells-and-whistles guy Dave Fridmann. This led to songs called ""4th Dimensional Transition"" and ""Of Moons, Birds &amp; Monsters"". Pastoral English pop, flighty mysticism, and studio-rat arrangements aren't the exception with this band, they're the rule.</p>
<p>Now they've returned with an album full of that stuff, and the result is audacious, ambitious, and a little fried. Working with Spacemen 3's Sonic Boom, MGMT have crafted a grandiose but not always clear-eyed record. Instead of the commercial climbers they're lumped alongside (the Killers, Kings of Leon, Muse), MGMT follow the lead of the Flaming Lips and Beck and prove to be kindred spirits with Of Montreal, Yeasayer, and Klaxons. They're in love with 1970s art-rock, and they've immersed themselves in uncool subgenres like pop-psych and prog. And despite the lack of marquee songs, they've made, top to bottom, a more interesting and even better record this time out.</p>
<p>If their success granted them the opportunity to do whatever they wanted, MGMT took advantage of it, layering songs with a surplus of ideas when a few good ones would have done. Every track here has successful passages, but frustratingly, they too often turn out to be detours or trap doors. In general, the less cluttered and more focused their tracks are, the better they turn out. The most satisfying songs are the ballads-- the title track in particular, but also ""I Found a Whistle""-- or the ones like ""It's Working"" and ""Someone's Missing"" that walk a fairly linear path. The most arduous is the 12-minute ""Siberian Breaks"", which has some intriguing elements but little discernible reason to be so densely constructed.</p>
<p>Few bands this year will release a record under more difficult circumstances than MGMT, and following a shock commercial success with a zig when your fans want you to zag has always been dangerous. MGMT aren't hitting the self-destruct button here, but the best-case scenario is that a cult, happy to shed the carpetbagger fans of <i>OS</i>, are willing to follow these guys around from idea to idea. Some may even use them as an introduction to the bands they've namechecked-- Spacemen 3, Brian Eno, Television Personalities-- and the sounds from which they've drawn inspiration. The more likely, short-term result is that MGMT are reined in a bit, not given so much rope to hang themselves. But that they <i>didn't</i> hang themselves here, given the circumstances, suggests a certain amount of talent. Whether they write club-friendly songs like ""Kids"" or tracks like ""Congratulations"" or ""Flash Delirium"" or ""It's Working"", they <i>can</i> write songs. Hopefully, next time they won't try to jam two dozen of them onto a nine-track album.</p></div>"|14122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14122-congratulations/|6.8|Scott Plagenhoef

It's not just because his discography includes a noisy digestive tract turned into a euphoric house melody; there's an appreciation for randomness, mistakes, and chaos that runs through his work. On his new solo album, <i>One One</i>, an artist who weaves multiple meanings into his music through contextual sampling strips down to a single source: himself.</p>
<p>At first, it seems like a playful volley in Herbert's game of dissecting music, politics, and theory. The first of a trio of conceptual releases, including <i>One Pig</i> (composed strictly of sounds from one pig) and <i>One Club</i> (sampled crowd noise from a club), <i>One One </i>focuses more on instruments and is 100% Herbert, including his own intimate vocals. It's a solo record simple and straightforward, less of a concept than we're used to from someone who can turn a rhythm track into an arch-consumerist critique. What then is the difficulty, statement, or challenge when an acclaimed producer makes his own album?</p>
<p>As with many things Herbert, it's not that easy or simple. A quieter, stripped-down approach to his typically tight rhythms and rich tones, <i>One One</i> has a deceptively relaxed vibe. It may be the rural studio that it was recorded in, or it may be Herbert being more introspective (just listen to him sing about home on ""Berlin""). He knows how to get the most out of his source material, and when that happens to be his own voice, he plays it cool or sticks to gentle, simple melodies. He doesn't showcase substantial range or a hidden talent, but Herbert does demonstrate a lack of artifice, self-awareness, and variety.""Singapore"" shines with a bright, folksy vibe and retro vocal harmonies. On the slow-burning single ""Leipzig"", his detached storytelling style fits the song's slinky, clubland theme.</p>
<p>While it's conceptually all about one man, by the end of the ten heartfelt tracks, it doesn't feel as personally revealing as it does poignant. Maybe it's because the self-contained solo project is more subtle overall, with poetic, yet still political, lyrics (""And with the rising of the seas/ Mouths will be open/ And with the drying of the fields/ Everything will be gone""). Herbert met the challenge of ditching some experimental baggage and being more straightforward; he doesn't always need an elaborate platform or sonic ruse to say something worth hearing.</p></div>"|14111.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14111-one-one/|7.6|Patrick Sisson

You can almost imagine Stones Throw offering Madlib the same luxury. The hyperprolific producer is a seeker, constantly refining and weirding up the signature haze he lends to his many projects. <i>Slave Riot</i> is the second Madlib-affiliated jazz record of 2010, a gauzy homage to the more freewheeling jazz of the 1960s and early 70s. Although it's missing much of the fire and the exploration of spirit that marked a lot of the jazz the Rebels tip their hats to, <i>Slave Riot</i> is further testament to Lib's open arms and near-unparalleled ear.</p>
<p>From the faux-vinyl crackle that opens and closes the record to the murky burble that underpins most of the tracks, there's little question this is a Madlib record. Drums take the front seat, and the constantly shifting rhythms provide the bed upon which these Rebels stretch out. Keys and electric bass provide much of the melody, as it were; there's precious little in the way of solos, opting instead for a casual interplay between the instruments. The aversion to structure and an abundance of loose, vampy improvisation demarcates this jazz as ""free,"" but this being Madlib, it trends towards the downbeat, content to percolate rather than boil over. The sound often echoes spacier Sun Ra records, with shades of Miles Davis' funk-forward early-70s bands (particularly in the live setting)-- or even the interstitial stuff on the mid-90s Boredoms LPs. That in-between feeling is <i>Slave Riot</i>'s biggest flaw; the Rebels constantly seem on the precipice of breaking out a towering solo, only to pull back or, worse yet, cut the track short.</p>
<p>But Madlib's every bit as adept at creating a mood on a jazz record as he is on his more familiar hip-hop productions, and <i>Slave Riot</i>'s gloriously overcast sound helps hold one's attention through its meanderings. This is free jazz for Madlib fans; it's crackly and inventive but warm and oddly familiar, and even if you're not the type to weigh Anthony Braxton improvisations against themselves, <i>Slave Riot</i>'s inviting tone is likely to draw you in. Though an aversion to virtuosity is odd considering the players-- Ivan ""Mamao"" Conti of Brazilian jazz-funk mainstays Azymuth and frequent J Dilla collaborator Karriem Riggins among them-- and things feel monochromatic at times, the record settles into an agreeable groove and builds slowly from there. One never knows what to expect next from Madlib, and <i>Slave Riot</i> would be a better record were it as unpredictable as its creator, but it's impossible to imagine another hip-hop producer succeeding quite this well acting on what amounts to a whim. Here's to whatever's next.</p></div>"|14121.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14121-slave-riot/|6.7|Paul Thompson

Originally a bedroom duo consisting of Ryan Heyner and Josh Kolenik, Small Black added two new members (including Pitchfork.tv contributors Juan Pieczanski and Jeff  Curtin) to bring the insular, demo-like tracks included here to a live setting. And if Small Black are shaping up to be a proper band (their upcoming full-length will feature the expanded line-up), this EP serves as an intriguing portrait of the group in its pollywog stage, making music that is simply stated and occasionally arresting.</p>
<p>Much of the EP sounds almost half-formed, as heavy reverb and over-processed synthesizers often overwhelm the subtle melodies and bright patches that anchor the dazed, mercurial songs. Most often, you have to work a little harder for the small rewards; beneath the tangled synth chatter and seasick sway of ""Weird Machines"" is a joviality that could be blown up to fill a large space (confirmed by a live version that appeared on a recent split EP with the like-minded Washed Out). Such revelry can spill out of a track at any given moment, and major highlight ""Despicable Dogs"" is by far the best demonstration of it here. But Heyner and Kolenik seem more interested in establishing a mood than pursuing full-on pop pleasures; they often sabotage their more accessible moments with noisy sample cycles and calamitous, disorienting percussion.</p>
<p>But <i>Small Black</i> should be approached as a document of a band in its embryonic form, a wash of ideas that work just often enough to be satisfying. The only real mistake is the addition of the two additional tunes-- the too-straightforward ""Kings of Animals"" and the ambling, harmonica-centered ""Baby Bird Pt. 2"". Both are true to the sound of the original EP, but they fail to conjure the same buzzing, sentimental vibe. Certainly the larger, fully formed version of Small Black is the one to look out for, but <i>Small Black</i>-- shaky, yet often gratifying-- is more than just a stop-gap.</p></div>"|14100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14100-small-black-ep/|7.0|Zach Kelly

Not only do they add urgency to familiar psychedelic rock templates, but they pay just as close attention to the quiet moments as the raging ones-- each track on their self-titled Thrill Jockey debut displays a careful layering of sounds and atmospheres.</p>
<p>The album is carefully sequenced and covers a lot of ground in seven tracks, though the propulsive ""Dead"", originally released as a single late last year, sits atop it like the flag on the peak of a mountain. While its guitars are chugging, and the intricate pummeling from Oneida drummer Kid Millions is almost exhausting, its force gets subtly distorted by the dreamy, shoegaze vocals. It's a push-pull between churning and floating, between abandon and control. ""Let the Right One In"" and ""Polvere Di Stelle"" are epics that benefit from the same attention and layering-- the former has a stillness to its clean guitar riff akin to Mogwai, while building patiently to a sizzling climax. On the latter, the band builds hair-raising guitar drones and squealing solos under the song's detached surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For other bands, the instrumentals between those aforementioned monsters would be a throwaway interlude; for White Hills; they're another chance to shine. These songs show the same careful layering, from the disorienting drones and campy space noises of ""Counting Sevens"" to the ambient outdoor noise of ""We Will Rise"" to the hair-raising tension of ""Glacial"". These songs are just as engaging in their own right, and the album's best tracks only benefit from the buildup and context that they provide.</p>
<p>There's hero worship here, for sure, in White Hills' nods to giants like Hawkwind and dorm-room-poster rock like Pink Floyd, but their scope is wide and their execution is steely and precise. Only the unabashed metal riffery of ""Three Quarters"" gets dragged down by an uninspired lyric and singing; tones and atmospheres come much more naturally to the band than theatricality. If they paid a little more care to their occasional vocal turn, White Hills could be world-conquering; as is, we'll have to settle for this merely excellent record.</p>

Pt. II </i>was that it actually existed. You could say the same for <i>Wu-Massacre</i>, a new<i> </i>collaboration<i> </i>from<i> </i>Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, and Method Man. Unlike <i>Cuban Linx II</i>-- a long-rumored sequel to a decade-old record-- talk of <i>Wu-Massacre</i> only began to surface last July. Tracks were leaked shortly afterward, videos were filmed, cover art was revealed, and now, it's here. Forget about Wu-Tang product; that timetable is unthinkable for most major hip-hop releases.</p>
<p>The limitations of that turnaround are unmistakable on <i>Wu-Massacre</i>. The three stars appear on a total of <i>three </i>songs together, and the padding they needed to push the album beyond CD-single status is obvious from the credits alone: two skits, guest verses from nearly every Theodore Unit B-teamer (Sheek Louch sorta counts at this point), and three remakes. All to account for about 30 minutes of music.</p>
<p>""Criminology"" was on <i>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx</i>, and it's probably the one word most closely associated with Raekwon's style. But for reasons that escape logic, he doesn't even show up to open the album on ""Criminology 2.5"". Hearing Method Man paraphrase some of his old lines (""Fuck that, criminology rap/ Niggas hate and I hate back, floating the flyest Maybach"") is a little like watching <i>Speed 2</i>, and the beat itself is just a glossed-up karaoke version of the original. ""Mef vs. Chef 2"" is better, but again, the sequel suffers from context-- on the original, whoever RZA chose as the winner of the duel of the iron mic would get the track on their solo release. Here, it shares space with a 30-second rant from Tracy Morgan on worthless hoes.</p>
<p>Still, at the record's core are three MCs willing to spend a little critical capital and just have fun over pitchshifted soul beats. Method Man could have felt like a third wheel here, but his concise hooks anchor the more awkwardly wordy ones from Ghost and Rae. Whether he's playing the seducer on ""Miranda"" or the verboloigst on ""Gunshowers"", Meth flexes the understated versatility that made his turns on <i>Cuban Linx II </i>so enduring. Ghostface thankfully sounds energized and committed again after last year's cynical <i>Wizard of Poetry</i>, which helps overshadow the familiarity of his material. ""Youngstown Heist"" finds him back in deranged ""Shakey Dog"" mode, which is fun again until Sheek Louch and Bully tank the song's second half.</p>
<p>But you evaluate what you got, not what you wanted, and being too harsh on <i>Wu-Massacre</i> is kind of like criticizing a hamburger for not performing a steak's duty. Twenty-five minutes of these three on autopilot still hits more often than not, ultimately making this disc a mixtape-y <i>More Fish</i>-style companion to <i>Cuban Linx II</i>-- hardly necessary, but not inconsequential.</p></div>"|14112.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14112-wu-massacre/|6.5|Ian Cohen

If anything, their innocent, home-recorded songs felt pastoral or coastal-- concerned more with breaking out of the city rather than toiling in it. That escapist tendency, mixed with their sonic primitivism and hopeful outlook, was refreshing. Even if their style wasn't exactly groundbreaking (we'd heard others combine global polyrhythms, hip-hop beats, and field recordings before), their approach was unique. In part because of Rob Barber's ragged production, High Places made those sounds feel roomy and lived-in.</p>
<p>While a good record, 2008's <i>High Places</i> was primarily an extension of what the band established with their singles collection <i>03/07 – 09/07</i>. The sound was slightly glossier, but mostly it was vocalist Mary Pearson once again cooing over Barber's fractured arrangements. With <i>High Places vs. Mankind</i>, though, all that is out of the window. If you count <i>High Places</i> as their first true album, then their latest is a classic sophomore change-up-- a departure in both style and temperament. Far from the doe-eyed innocence and sunny bliss of their earlier work, High Places are darker and much more somber here, and their approach to recording and presentation has changed.</p>
<p>The biggest difference is the band's mood. High Places used to stress resiliency and optimism, but now they seem resigned to life's disappointments. On early track ""On Giving Up"", Pearson, who once radiated childlike hopefulness, sings solemnly of loss: ""Though I have cried so many times before, it's all because I feel everything that's gone."" Similar themes of heartbreak and fear exist throughout the album, and there's a notable change in the way the band sounds, too. Instead of the earlier sample-heavy style, Barber incorporates more live instrumentation, and as a result High Places feel more like a <i>band</i>. There are still loops and dance elements, but the focus is often more on heavy post-punk guitar-and-bass lines that enhance the overall gloomy vibe.</p>
<p>It's a surprising turn for the group, and whether or not you like them more as sunny optimists or somber realists is a matter of taste. The more pressing question is how this shift affects the quality of the songs. Mostly it works, but there are also songs here, especially the instrumental ones (""The Channon"", ""Drift Slayer"") that aren't very memorable. Even a few of the more pop-focused cuts tend to skimp on melody, and it makes me think that in the band's desire to overhaul, they lost a bit of their initial spark. Still, the album is encouraging because it shows a talented young group unafraid of growth. Even if this isn't their best collection of songs, it takes nerve to try something so different.</p></div>"|14103.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14103-high-places-vs-mankind/|7.0|Joe Colly

They wrote a handful of songs together; several appeared on 2002's limited-run ""antifolk"" compilation <i>AFNY Collaborations, Vol. 1</i>, but they've largely gone unheard, if not unremembered. Almost 10 years later, we have <i>The Bundles</i>, a collection of tunes crafted on their first meeting, fleshed out with a few recent stragglers. The initial batch of songs comes from a particularly fertile, formative period for both songwriters: Lewis' early stuff is easily his most distinct, and Dawson's early-00s work with Adam Green is among her most beloved. The two seem like a good pair, sharing a bunch of fans, a kooky worldview, and a fondness for loose chords and uneasy answers. But listening to <i>The Bundles</i>, one wonders why they felt these songs were due for a resurrection.</p>
<p>As with most bursts of creative energy, <i>The Bundles</i> starts out strong; opener ""A Common Chorus"" has a Moldy Peaches-style two-songs-at-once verse that ambles toward the titular hook. Dawson's wizened warble and Lewis' world-weariness sit comfortably beside each other, and when they overlap for the tune's big payoff, it's nearly as satisfying as anything in either's vast catalog. But, as always, these two proudly display (and sometimes flaunt) their flaws, and <i>The Bundles</i> seems to amplify them. The mostly Lewis-led ""Shamrock Glamrock"" is dour and unfocused, a sharp shift in tone from the laughs they'd been having on previous tracks, and the hokey blues-punk of ""Ishalicious"" is a genre experiment that thankfully neither has replicated since. Dawson's budding ability to flip something strange into something strangely poignant hadn't fully formed yet, so a lot of these tunes lean awfully hard on nonsense. The lovely ""Over the Moon"", with its appeal to community and rousing choral closeout, is another winner, but there's little else to recommend in the middle of the record; the tunes feel limp and half-finished, the lyrics disjointed and drab, the two songsmiths often writing over, not with, each other.</p>
<p>Fans of Lewis or Dawson aren't gonna care much that this isn't holy grail stuff; if you've been following either, you're used to a little unevenness. But the true superfans have likely heard the best of these tunes before, on the <i>AFNY</i> comp-- save rousing closer ""Be Yourself""-- and the <i>Juno</i> set may not know what to make of Dawson at her most unbridled, to say nothing of Lewis' eager-Eeyore routine. If you never gave a hoot about either, 40 uneven minutes of frayed chords and poop jokes probably won't change that. Both have done and are doing better work, and while the bulid-up to <i>The Bundles</i> makes for a neat story, it reads a little better without this final chapter.</p></div>"|14106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14106-the-bundles/|5.0|Paul Thompson

Dosh's previous records had a tendency to open with a sort of tonal discretion, allowing the listener some sapce before working themselves into jazz-imbued grooves. <i>Tommy</i>, however, begins in the middle, and as such, ""Subtractions"" sounds as if someone had flipped the ""record"" switch during a jam session without letting anyone know that tape was rolling. That restlessly energizing sound bleeds right into ""Yer Face"", with vapor-trailed drum fills and snatches of coos surrounding a rare, sighing vocal turn by Dosh himself. Together, these tunes are arguably more potent than anything Dosh has recorded throughout his career. An album filled with tracks like these would be a real treat.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <i>Tommy</i> is not that album. Much of the record-- named after and dedicated to late soundman and friend Tom Cesario-- finds Dosh working comfortably within his folktronica wheelhouse. Maybe too comfortably, in fact: it's very easy to let this record pass right by you without noticing it's there. The issue isn't a consistent mood, though: there are takes on IDM (""Country Road X""), hip-hop (""Airlift""), and bummed-out folk (""Nevermet"") here. However, none of these genres are tackled with anything more than a mannered intention, as Dosh treats the material with fussiness. What it really needs is a shot of spontaneity. Album low point ""Number 41"", featuring Andrew Bird, is especially staid, with a drowsy vocal turn by Bird that makes even the most boring of his own material seem effervescent by comarpsion.</p>
<p>Regardless, <i>Tommy</i>'s strongest moments-- the elegiac piano on the ironically-named ""Loud"" or the hollow boom-bap of ""Airlift""-- sound fully realized and complete, suggesting that Dosh's best work is still yet to come. When Dosh stretches his legs on the album's longer compositions, the results are especially compelling: a honking saxophone riff turns ""Call the Kettle"" into a woozy carnival ride, while the acoustic post-rock textures of eight-minute-plus closer ""Gare de Lyon"" rip open to reveal a brawny guitar figure and supercharged cymbal hits. Dosh has indeed graduated from the sketchbook-like arrangements that marked his earlier work-- but <i>Tommy</i>'s occasional tedium is a reminder that there's nothing wrong with doodling in the margins, either.</p></div>"|14114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14114-tommy/|6.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

After a quick EP and single released within a year of their 2009 formation, they're bringing <i>Escape</i> (via recent lo-fi haven Woodsist) just as swiftly. Four songs in just under 30 krautrock minutes, it's an LP that pulls Johnson even closer to Suicide and Silver Apples, influences that have played an audibly important role in his work with Wooden Shjips. Johnson's vocals are barely there, whispers buried in sheets of two-chord riffs and Yamada's keyboard dissonance. Moon Duo don't stray too far from the deep-cutting, fuzzy gymnastics of Johnson's other band, though he's allowed further freedom to hypnotize on the playground where he's most comfortable. More than just a branching off deeper into another third eye, <i>Escape</i> is a pop record at its core.</p>
<p>Or at each end. Opener ""Motorcycle, I Love You"" churns along on a classic Phil Spector drumbeat, speeding up as Yamada and Johnson add layer upon layer of shadow and menace. It's a very sexy juxtaposition, and Moon Duo's music is sexy throughout, the interplay between Johnson and Yamada on full, propulsive display. Whether Johnson's taking a pause to add some breathy vocals or working up a froth on his guitar, the song's pulse won't quit. The middle of the record's a different animal. ""In the Trees"" slows shit down to a grind, Johnson soloing through screens and clouds of low-end more akin to the drone of Wooden Shjips. ""Stumbling 22nd St"" employs an equally heavy feel, Yamada acting as the song's melodic spine this time out with a keyboard riff her bandmate embraces from time to time by mimicking it on guitar.</p>
<p>The titular closing track is pure pop in comparison, if only in that it's infinitely lighter and easy to digest. Riffing over a drumbeat and a breeze, Johnson sounds a lot like Ducktails' Matthew Mondanile as the latter does when in his zone. All that track-by-track geeking aside, what makes <i>Escape</i> so successful is that these two are able to meet you halfway-- just as they do one another. Traditionally, the repetitive forms they're working with make for relatively passive listening. But this isn't that kind of psych record; textures are engaging, rhythms reveal serious drive.

Or at least truly awful. A 2xCD album, with 22 guest vocalists, devoted to the life, loves, and sartorial obsessions of the infamous Imelda Marcos, wife of equally infamous Filipino despot Ferdinand Marcos? Masterminded by two of music's most inventive nerds-- David Byrne and Fatboy Slim? Oddball subject, high-profile collaborators, unchecked ambition: a combination that should guarantee either a left-field classic or a cringe-inducing misstep. A grand or gaudy approach that fits the garish, romantic, obsessive arc of its heroine's life.</p>
<p>Instead we get efficient dance-pop and tropical-tinged adult alternative given the routinized sheen of Broadway showtunes. For a few songs the combination's curious enough to maintain semi-passive interest. Persevere through all 22 tunes, and you'll find an EP's worth of keepers, mostly thanks to strong performances by the usual suspects: Róisín Murphy transforming a just-funky-enough disco pastiche into another of her patented conversational come-ons; Sharon Jones as New Jack Swing-era rent-a-diva. But less than an hour in, the album's initially exquisite-sounding production starts to feel weirdly oppressive. It smothers the playfulness and rough edges of Byrne and Slim's respective obsessions-- Bahia-meets-Bacharach romanticism and shamelessly big beats-- in a layer of icky showbiz schmaltz.</p>
<p>Imagine a Vegas producer staging an all-star tribute to Caetano Veloso, or the Lawrence Welk band rearranging the Jam and Lewis songbook. Or maybe just imagine two oddball pop geniuses choosing to collaborate on a pet project in the waning days of the album era. But once in the studio, the pair contracts some kind of airborne soft-rock virus. Thus infected, they can only manage to write the kind of unthreatening but unfailingly <i>pleasant</i> filler designed to pad out department store playlists when programmers run out of Train songs. How else to explain the weakest songs on <i>Here Lies Love</i>, especially the second half of disc one? And even they're not <i>bad</i>, per se, unless the very idea of bland competence offends you.</p>
<p>Byrne and Slim never misstep here, but they also never surprise. At best you may wind up distantly admiring their craftsmanship. But if musicians are going for scale and spectacle-- and a project like this all but demands it-- shouldn't they, like, <i>go for it</i>? True, most overlong and overambitious concept albums wind up total trainwrecks, but at least then they're sorta enjoyable for it. But like a middling 1,000 page novel, or a three-hour cinematic epic that's just kind of okay, a competent 90-minute mini-musical serves only one purpose: To reinforce the precious finitude of human life. Devote an hour-and-a-half to this? Why? You could listen to <i>Remain in Light</i> twice with time to spare. Or just play ""The Rockafeller Skank"" 13 times in a row.</p></div>"|14113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14113-here-lies-love/|5.0|Jess Harvell

But ultimately that puts <i>The Dark Leaves</i> in a position to be judged against music that has so much more to offer. The project's shortcomings are even more pronounced this time out since <i>The Dark Leaves</i> sounds like it's striving and somewhat succeeding in being the band's most rhythmically vital record. <i>Leaves</i>' first third tries to pump itself up with double-time, handclap-sparked rhythms owing something to polite church revivals (""Starting"") and rockabilly (""Running Wild"", which gives a nod to Queen's ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love""). But neither comes anywhere close to generating actual friction amidst such downy arrangements. These are mostly compositions of ""roots"" instruments, including acoustic guitars, pedal steel, and violins. But a cooling wash of synth pads and reverb makes everything flow like a shot of Jäger down an ice luge-- smooth but sickly sweet and mostly numbing. Indeed, there's a narcotic effect to sleepy weepers like ""Brooklyn Fawn"" and ""Specks"", so when the ca. 2000 Brit-rock of ""Ruins"" hits a couple of strange flatted notes on its way up the piano scale, it's a jarring but welcome display of energy.</p>
<p>But elsewhere, too much is demanded of Pond, one of the meekest vocalists ever to name a band after himself. His voice isn't unpleasant in a grating or unusual way, but there's an unsettling quality to it that sounds like it's been shot through with Vaseline, eliding over his lyrics so you accidentally hear things like, ""I believe in manatees."" The actual next line is, ""I believe in you and me/ Everything we'll ever see,"" meaning that Pond is sticking to cryptic-- but not particularly interesting-- stories of lost love and icky Dave Matthews-style romance (""Running Wild""). Pond pleads on ""Remains"", ""If you want my blood, let me bleed/ If you want a ghost/ Then that's what I'll be."" But his hitching, strained phrasing conveys bothersome neediness rather than strident devotion. The subject of ""Brooklyn Fawn"" might be some sort of embodiment of substance-related frailty, but it's so vague that you only recognize Pond's habit of invoking the borough's name in hopes of siphoning some of its urban intrigue. Replace ""Brooklyn"" with ""Teaneck"" and it's pretty much the same song.</p>
<p>Another key line from ""Remains"": ""I can't remember which movie taught me pain."" Like some of Pond's better-known lyrics-- ""Heard it's modern to be stupid,"" ""I don't think I want to think about it""-- it's ostensibly meant to be a deadpan commentary on the emotional disconnectedness of the upwardly mobile. But it ultimately carries no weight in the context of <i>The Dark Leaves</i>' willingness to slip into the background, content to be something you tune out while going about your day.</p></div>"|14058.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14058-the-dark-leaves/|4.8|Ian Cohen

Not only did it look pretty boss as a jpeg, it also was pretty accurate visual shorthand for their sound: Less turntablism, more an FM tuner shoulder-jostling between low-watt stations playing electro, funk, world music, and early hip-hop.</p>
<p>Javelin first parceled out that unique approach with a series of mixes and singles, most of which were hazy and fidelity-challenged enough for people to lump them in with chillwave. But Javelin's genetic code seemed more early-80s than late-60s, and the sound quality seemed like more of a mood-setter than a slapdash affectation. On <i>Jamz n Jemz, </i>Tom van Buskirk and George Langford crafted a cohesive sound collage more in step with the dense travelogues of the Avalanches than any of their basement-electronic peers.</p>
<p>So it actually made sense when musical travel agency Luaka Bop signed them up for their proper debut, <i>No Mas</i>. By the sound of the record, Luaka Bop also gave Javelin a good, long bath, exfoliating away the crackles and hiss and distilling the songs from their interstitial surroundings. The fully groomed result is a segmented hybrid of semi-revised previously released tracks and new music that reveals the duo as a far less exotic product than early scouting may have suggested. ""Vibrationz"" is still a killer single, but other familiar tunes sound adrift when isolated from a broader mix, such as the 70s montage sequence ""The Merkin Jerk"", or the glitch-hop of ""Susie Cues"". Attempts to makeover old tracks are a mixed bag, as the sunny ""Intervales Theme"" holds up at double the length, while adding vocals to previously instrumental ""Mossy Woodland"" is an awkward move.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Javelin's new material fits in well alongside older tracks without doing much to expand the duo's palate. ""Tell Me What Will I Be?"" is a funk period piece that would turn the Dap-Kings green, ""On It on It"" summons up all the right robot-leg flashbacks, and ""Shadow Heart"" has a cinematic, psychedelic sweep that evades being pinned down as just one particular homage. If songs like the overdone retro of ""Moscow 1980"" and the directionless soul jam ""Dep"" are less memorable, well, at least they might have a second life as puzzle pieces in a future Javelin collage.</p>
<p>In the end <i>No Mas </i>can't top those longer mixes, which remain van Buskirk and Langford at their sample-heavy, genre-trotting finest. Dressed up and chopped into discrete chunks, Javelin suddenly bear a close resemblance to the Go! Team-- skilled peddlers of vintage party jams, but with a narrow range. Javelin's best tracks may hold up under professional production in a year where many a group's cassette-tape flaws will likely sabotage similar leaps, but trading in their boombox for a proper stereo isn't necessarily an upgrade.</p></div>"|14115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14115-no-mas/|7.2|Rob Mitchum

They've since released a few EPs, always honing a distinct, layered, and monstrous sound that seems far too large to be the work of just two men. <i>Extra Wow-- </i>their second full-length and first for Warp—keeps the eclecticism of their previous work but aims to be more cohesive via a relentlessly sunny, psychedelic feel.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Rather than lean on samples and loops as simple backing tracks, Nice Nice have a musical conversation with them. Over a drone of human voices and machine-like buzzing, ""Set and Setting"" begins with an insistent beat, and the guitar and vocals stab through the mix in monotone bursts. That haze slides into ""One Hit"", which is marked by full-band staccato pounding, falling apart into messy skronk before resuming again. ""A Way We Glow"" starts with a cymbal patter before layering on bells, whistles, bird noises, inscrutable percussion, and various electronic squiggles-- though it's the high falsetto that gives the track its airy, dreamlike feel. The two men manage to sound like one big machine on the verge of blowing apart.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The interplay between the two musicians and their numerous loops is so remarkably fluid, it's not until fifth track ""Everything Falling Apart"" that individual contributions become discernible. Yet even as that song provides a steadier beat and recognizable lyrics, its tension comes from the frantic pace and the circular, chirping melody that closes it. As the record progresses, the line between man and machine gets more blurred. A chorus of what sounds like thumb pianos gives ""See Waves"" a distinctive sound while keeping with the album's eclectic vibe. Most of the album's second half follows the same pattern to less memorable effect. There are a lot of recent genre-blurring artists that <i>Extra Wow</i> can remind you of in spirit-- recent Animal Collective, Dan Deacon, Caribou. But while those artists found greater success by paring down and tightening their focus, Nice Nice are all about repetition and expansion. It's technically stunning for just two men, but with the exception of a few tighter tracks, <i>Extra Wow</i> is too gleefully overloaded to do more than maintain a vibe and feel.</p></div>"|14072.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14072-extra-wow/|7.0|Jason Crock

Specifically, ""blood"" or ""conflict"" diamonds, gems mined by some of the world's poorest people and subsequently used to fund warfare that further endangers those impoverished individuals. Thanks to a song by Kanye West and a film starring Leo DiCaprio, Western audiences have recently been widely exposed to horrors taking place in Sierra Leone since the early 1990s. But voices originating from the country itself, addressing its struggles and disseminating its unique national character, have been in short supply in the West.</p>
<p>Musically, Sierra Leone likewise hasn't established a global presence on par with West African neighbors like Nigeria and Mali. Enter Janka Nabay, a Sierra Leone native who escaped the country during the bloody 90s and is now bringing its music to new ears as a transplanted resident of Philadelphia. Specifically, the sound Nabay makes is known as bubu music, a genre rooted in the rhythms of funeral processions conducted by the Muslim Temne people of the country's northwest region. Bubu is traditionally produced by large groups of players blowing on bamboo shoots, accompanied by shakers, triangles, and thudding pulse-beats pounded out on large wooden boxes. Nabay severely strips down this setup while preserving its teeming twitchiness, using keyboards and carburetor pipes to create a minimal but undeniably kinetic brand of music that he weds to socially conscious lyrics.</p>
<p><i>Bubu King</i> is an EP of four songs Nabay recorded before departing Sierra Leone and represents the first-ever commercial release of bubu music in the West. Considering these tracks have been sitting in the can for about 15 years, the frequent modernity of their sound is remarkable, starting with the opener, ""Top Sul Bah"", which pairs rattling percussion with dreamy synthesized tones. Of course, Nabay makes such minimalism all his own with the chanting intonations he lays atop the beat-- the song's title translates as ""What's Going On"", and that's exactly what Nabay wishes to convey. The succeeding track, ""Eh Congo"", ratchets up the politicized content with references to John Kennedy and allusions to the humanitarian influx of wheat and clothing, though the music's repetitive pipe pattern ultimately drags over the song's five minutes.</p>
<p>More sonically successful and even more socially charged, ""Good Governance"" boasts a busily skittering beat intermittently supplemented with a wonderful descending keyboard melody, with lyrics (in English) that call earnestly but admirably for democracy bolstered by the participation of women. <i>Bubu King</i> then closes with the lovely but anomalous ""De Debul"", a beautiful guitar-laden track that seems much more in line with the melodic West African stuff we in the West have been devouring with particular gusto in recent years.  It's a nice tune, but a touch less distinctive. Here's hoping this EP inspires Nabay to share more of Sierra Leone's uniquely engaging bubu music down the road.</p></div>"|14104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14104-bubu-king/|7.1|Joshua Love

Doves did enough anthemic rafter-reaching to honor predecessors like Oasis and the Verve. They were also studio-centric and tech-savvy enough to satisfy an <i>OK Computer </i>jones, while having enough British classicism for people not ready to follow Radiohead down the rabbit hole. And there were many of them, to the point where ""new Radiohead"" (ironically sounding like the <i>old </i>Radiohead) became one of the early new century's most briskly populated UK indie subgenres.</p>
<p>With the possible exception of Elbow, none were better than Doves. So as <i>The Places Between </i>collects the best of the Doves (fortunately, it's not fooling anyone going by ""Greatest Hits""), what's striking is how little it bears to the current landscape of rock music on either side of the Atlantic. As Stuart Berman pointed out in his review of <i>Kingdom of Dust, </i>former opening acts like the Strokes and the Rapture both pointed the way for sounds and, more importantly, images that would ultimately make Doves seem stodgy and unsexy by comparison.</p>
<p>Debut <i>Lost Souls </i>remains an enduringly consistent piece of shadowy, orchestral rock, and it could've been well represented here by any of its tracks. Despite being posed as the darkness before <i>The Last Broadcast</i>'s light, <i>Lost Souls </i>gets cherrypicked for its most emphatic numbers. ""Catch the Sun"" remains the strongest melody Jimi Goodwin has ever written, while the harmonica and guitar peals of the misty ""Sea Song"" exude a low-key ecstacy. Even the stately, string-led waltz ""Man Who Told Everything"" is included as a truncated ""summer"" version.</p>
<p>Still, ""There Goes The Fear"" might stand as their crowning achievement: seven minutes, none of them wasted, rushing forth with an undeniable freewheeling brio and a percussive outro that still stuns (unfortunately, companion piece ""Words"" and its mawkish U2-isms is included over the luminous ballad ""Satellites""). The grand, sweeping gestures of ""Caught By the River"" would be the most fittingly majestic closer of Doves' career if it weren't for the song that succeeds it on <i>Places Between</i>, which ends where Doves began, the ""what if <i>Second Coming </i>went right?"" drum barrage ""The Cedar Room"".</p>
<p>Though <i>Some Cities </i>features what might be Doves' closest thing to a stateside hit (the Motown-bound ""Black and White Town""), the record itself lacked the juice of its predecessors, coinciding with a time when Coldplay loomed large and Keane broke. <i>Kingdom of Rust </i>was solid as well, but at this point, Doves were simply a band easy to take for granted, or even ignore. ""Andalucia"", a new song included here, tends to affirm the reasons Doves eventually opened up for Coldplay instead of the other way around-- Doves' looser rock numbers don't have enough oomph to cover for Goodwin's questionable vocal range and the band's general lack of charisma.</p>
<p>As much as you want to view <i>The Places Between </i>as a triumphant document of Doves' potency, I can't help but feel a somewhat depressing sense of finality-- especially when the tracklist is so stacked toward their first two albums (nine out of the 14 previously available songs. In a weird way, it actually honors the latter two by picking far and away their best songs and reintroducing them. More likely, <i>The Places Between </i>is all about reintroducing Doves as a band to people who initially, wrongly wrote them off.</p></div>"|14107.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14107-the-places-between-the-best-of-doves/|7.8|Ian Cohen

Their lyrics stressed both punk principles and emotional outpourings. Their music was furious but catchy, with a set of mannerisms that flowed smoothly into indie-rock, pop-punk, and alt-rock: palm-muted power chords laced with bright octaves and harmonics; guitar leads rounding off into whistling feedback; counter-melodic bass lines; and epic breakdowns with arty sampled monologues. They had lofty ideals, but their songs walked around on the streets, sullen and pissed, with fresh scabs and dog-eared volumes of Bukowski in their back pockets.</p>
<p>The phrase ""emo-core"" itself is a problematic compromise between hardcore and pop-- an angst-inducing identity for a young band. Blake Schwarzenbach was 22 when Jawbreaker's 1990 debut, <i>Unfun</i>, came out, and this was but one of the pressures that drove him. Recriminating tunefully through a shredded throat, he calibrated himself against a punk scene and adult world of coequal injustice. <i>Unfun</i> was Jawbreaker's punkest record, but he feared it wasn't punk enough: ""Sorry we ain't hard enough to piss your parents off,"" he snipped on ""Incomplete"". His fretful intelligence often led him to dispense free psychological evaluations and strawman parables. There are many issues-based songs: ""Softcore"" is anti-porn, and ""Seethruskin"" is anti-racism. It gets almost Orwellian: ""Don't think that I ain't counting all the things you do,"" Schwarzenbach bristles in scene-cop mode. (He always loved those sassy ""ain'ts."") To that extent, the record earns its title.</p>
<p>Yet the music itself is irrepressibly fun. Drummer Adam Pfahler was a fucking behemoth, a whiz with galloping toms and breathtakingly long fills. He sounds great on this low-end boosted reissue, which, on CD and download, also includes the formative <i>Whack &amp; Blite </i>EP. And Schwarzenbach's prickliness was ultimately sympathetic, because it stemmed from a vulnerability he laid bare in songs like ""Want"", where dark secrets are exorcised in the name of love. ""So now you know where I come from,"" he sings, underlining it twice for emphasis: ""My secret's come undone/ My heart reveals my cause."" The world is fallen, but he's not dancing on the wreckage. He's looking for survivors, imploring on ""Busy"", ""We're all close to the end; don't you need a friend?/ Honor your allegiances!""</p>
<p>By 1995's major-label but still-fierce swan song, <i>Dear You</i>, Jawbreaker seemed wholly out of step with the scene that revered them; a broken lineage made painfully clear by the terrible cover versions modern emo bands produce. Schwarzenbach managed one pretty great album with Jets to Brazil, <i>Orange Rhyming Dictionary</i>, before petering out into mojo-less soft rock. With reunion and documentary rumors rumbling, Jawbreaker is primed for renewed attention, though one wonders what emo fans raised on Dashboard Confessional, Warped Tour, and Vagrant Records will make of their pinched, petulant sound. Regardless, the original music stands tall. On <i>Unfun</i>, Jawbreaker's conviction that punk could open up to pop while staying hardcore burns more urgently than ever, in the retrospective light of futility.</p></div>"|14079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14079-unfun/|7.7|Brian Howe

And given the nature of your typical odds-and-ends collection-- curious diversions at best, throwaway experiments at worst, and a whole lot of business as usual in between-- you'd be forgiven for expecting little more than fan-bait out of a release that gathers the band's between-album singles and rarities. But the big draw of Wooden Shjips is the way they go about streamlining multiple strains of psychedelic rock with the single-mindedness of a band more interested in refinement than experimentation, and there's plenty of refined material on <i>Vol. 2</i>.</p>
<p>It helps that Wooden Shjips had already synthesized a wide range of approaches into their sound by the time they set about following up their debut. Attention's been given to their old-school acid rock influences, but they draw from the other end of the 1970s just as vividly. ""Loose Lips"" here is a good exhibit of this-- not just with Ripley Johnson's characteristically distant, spooked Alan Vega vocals, but its nods to Chrome's aluminum-guitar sound and droning keyboards reminiscent of the first Tubeway Army album as well. B-side ""Start to Dreaming"" is a bit less distinct, and the rushed attempt at cramming a slow build into its first 45 seconds sounds a little superfluous, especially for one of their shorter songs. But it does a decent job of highlighting the frenetic interplay of Johnson's vertigo-inducing guitar solos and Nash Whalen's strobe-light organ riffs.</p>
<p>Like most of the tracks collected here, ""Start to Dreaming"" gives the guitar and keyboard free reign to wander elaborately over a relatively static rhythm section. Wooden Shjips songs aren't particularly restless when it comes to grooves, and good luck finding a chorus, but letting the drums and bass plod along until they sink into the background lets you zoom in on the elaborate swirls of noise that sprawl across them. They do this to bracing effect in a few different gears: The slo-mo Hawkwind swells on ""I Hear the Vibrations (E-Z Version)"" melt into the cracks between the beats and bubble back out again, while live-show cut ""Death's Not Your Friend"" stretches a cursory two-minute cut from 2006's <i>Shrinking Moon for You</i> EP into a blistering, loose-limbed seven-minute sprint.</p>
<p>Then there are the covers, which find the common threads that bind Neil Young and Serge Gainsbourg, however loosely. The two songs actually serve as good boundary markers for Wooden Shjips' usual rhythmic drone/melodic sprawl approach: at one end, buzzing stomps shot through with heat haze for ""Vampire Blues""; at the other, a fluid and sinuous motion on the pop-psych slink of ""Contact"". Good thing there's a lot of space between those two poles, since they sound best when they're at some point on that continuum. When everything sinks into the same rigid rhythm, like the band does on the solo-deficient churn of ""Outta My Head"", Wooden Shjips risk sounding like a band that's treading water instead of floating through it. It's atypical, sure-- but sometimes finding new approaches isn't necessarily more important than polishing up the one that works.</p></div>"|14078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14078-vol-2/|6.3|Nate Patrin

Granted, the rhythmic play in their work might not have always been the focus, but, live and on record, the duo's use of stereo effects has long given their tracks a tidal, back-and-forth motion. Since leaving Kranky in 2004, Growing have avoided flatlining hums altogether. On 2006's <i>Color Wheel</i>, when they were still collecting Eno and Earth comparisons, the effects through which Denardo and Doria routed their guitar and bass-- and the way those pieces fit, phasing and lacing up and down, in and out-- gave tracks like ""Fancy Period"" and ""Green Pastures"" tiny but distinct rhythms.</p>
<p>They kept at it: On both the 2008 EP <i>Lateral</i> and the 2008 LP <i>All the Way</i>, Growing emphasized that metric aspect, making it obvious by adding actual beats (""Rave Pie Only"") or, more frequently, by stacking gorgeous tones that created incidental rhythm. It comes as little surprise, then, that Growing have now made the next beat-driven advance, adding a third member, vocalist and sampler controller Sadie Laska, and shifting the balance of their focus from tones graced by rhythms to rhythms graced by tones. But there's always a downbeat: It doesn't work, at least not yet.</p>
<p>Growing have been at their best when they've been most immersive, when they let the listener slip into their atmosphere of ideas. And that-- not this newly pronounced dependence on rhythms and vocals-- is why <i>PUMPS! </i>is so underwhelming. Growing's approach is uncharacteristically undeveloped here, as the trio never seems to know for what exactly what it's aiming. On ""Massive Dropout"", they stunt an interesting, textural beat with unnecessary electronic interference. After all, it's easier to hide ancillary sounds beneath a roar that saturates the tape than beneath a drum machine that leapfrogs from one meter to the next.</p>
<p>Closer ""Mind Eraser"" succeeds where its predecessors don't, committing to one idea and stretching it across the album's most vibrant eight minutes. The beat-- quick, skittering bursts of cheap electronic drums-- enters at the top, followed by repeated, short stabs of noise that, relative to the rest of the kit, feel like a heavy-metal kick drum. Laska eases in samples of clipped phrases, pushing them and pulling them through the mix. Chopped and twisted, they bounce off of the beat and each other, different colors of light colliding in funhouse mirrors.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the new Growing jumps from thought to thought, with very few of them being very interesting. ""Camera '84"" lays spectral vocals beneath a big, dumb beat, adding veins of noise wherever they fit. It's a confused, ricocheting piece of music that never finds its groove. Similarly, the transitions are mostly circumstantial, half-baked attempts to make a somewhat seamless album. The wood block pitter-patter that emerges with only a dozen seconds left in ""Challenger"" and exits six seconds into ""Highlight"" has little to do with either track. With nearly 30 seconds left, ""Highlight"" sloughs the beat and the electronic pops and plinks flying from channel to channel, forcing a jump into the long drift that leads to ""Drone Burger"", the album's two-minute acknowledgment of Growing's sprawling past. It's a painful reminder: Growing, the half-dance trio, need to put in a lot of work before they can augment that legacy.</p></div>"|14105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14105-pumps/|6.1|Grayson Currin

His homebase is Brooklyn-via-Minneapolis, his label affiliation is Ghostly-via-Moodgadget, and his music is hip-hop-via-electro-- or maybe vice-versa; you know how lines get blurred these days. Lindgren's career as synthesizer-fidgeting beatmaker Mux Mool has been defined more by sounds than styles-- one of those widescreen genre-absorbing approaches that's made ""bass music"" the vague but fitting descriptor of choice for instrumental post-hip-hop. And in keeping with the approach of a generation that finds electronic sounds to be not only natural but familiar, he tends to bring out the loose, humanistic side of waveforms and electronic keyboards in all their idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p>That's probably one of the more cohesive ways to pin down the personality of <i>Skulltaste</i>, an album that's a hell of a lot harder to define in terms of scenes or categories. Floating through Boards of Canada wooziness one moment, churning out Tobacco-esque bass filth the next, Mux Mool has put together an album whose sonic multiple-personality disorder could be aggravating if it wasn't so consistently engaging. And for all his weirdo fronting-- eccentric song titles, a <i>Tron</i>-gone-metal visual aesthetic, sparsely doled-out party clichés and braggadocio as the only prominent lyrical content-- his work transcends its mild jokiness to reveal the adventurousness of a musical scholar.</p>
<p>Every scholar needs a starting point, and Mux Mool's seems to be the watershed period where chart-rap juggernauts, Native Tongues heirs, and independent-as-fuck iconoclasts were all pushing the boundaries of what they could do with synthesizers. So you could call this stuff hip-hop if you felt like it-- there's a heavy pulse of clap-beats, intricate snares, and rave bass that split the difference between <i>Fantastic, Vol. 2</i>'s warmth and the blown-out dirtiness of <i>The Cold Vein</i>. But that's just the support structure, and it bolsters everything from lurching boom-bap (""Breakfast Enthusiast"") and euphoric Dirty South bounce (""Ballad of Gloria Featherbottom"") to the blissed-out ""Morning Strut"", which features a choppy, mournful piano straight out of the 9th Wonder playbook.</p>
<p>And while <i>Skulltaste </i>falls under hip-hop jurisdiction if you go by Bambaataa rules, it definitely stretches way the hell out, branching into ambient downtempo, glossy disco, and neon electro. No complaints here, quality-wise-- ""Enceladus"" is perfect circa-1999 French-style house, and the manic shudder of ""Crackers"" is the kind of hyperspeed pop-and-lock fodder that leaves lesser 80s-evoking club jams in the dust. A fluid stylistic identity isn't the worst thing to have, and when he dials down the tempo and delivers something like the warped-tape ""SFW Porn"" or the lowrider-hovercar anthem ""Dandelion"", dude straight up steals your favorite chillwave band's lunch money. It's definitely exciting to hear an artist who can excel in so many different corners of beat music, but it'll really pay off once Mux Mool finishes carving out a corner of his own.</p></div>"|14090.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14090-skulltaste/|7.5|Nate Patrin

The title of her debut album, <i>Baduizm, </i>turned her name into a religion, a concept. On 2008's <i>New Amerykah: Part One</i>, she sang, ""Everything around you see/ The ankhs, the wraps, the plus degrees/ And, yes, even the mysteries-- it's all me."" It's not that she ignores the world at large, it's that she invariably draws her observations and opinions back to home base: herself, her family, her experience, her music. She and her boyfriend Jay Electronica took turns tweeting through her third pregnancy. (""I see the head, full of hair"" read one Biblically paced message.) She named the baby Mars.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">After <i>Baduizm</i>, she kept writing vocal lines and melodies but loosened her song structures to the point that her albums sounded like a series of digressions. The pose she struck on record became increasingly informal. Her final statements became ellipses. The change wasn't a drop in quality, but a shift in style. <i>Mama's Gun</i> and <i>Worldwide Underground</i> (from 2000 and 2003, respectively) are albums that, at best, sound like music that was made with no effort and very little planning. And though there's never any doubt that she's the center of attention, she started singing like she was off to the side. In its own way, Badu's music is ambient music: It drifts, ebbs, and flows. The verses don't have to hang together as long as the mood does.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">2008's <i>New Amerykah Part One</i> was an unusually dark, hard album for her. Instead of the precedent for India.Arie, she was the echo of Sly Stone: fucked-up, long-winded, and overflowing. In her own way, Badu is always protesting something-- the way people betray themselves to be accepted by society, the way society forces people to stop being individuals-- but <i>New Amerykah</i> was almost like a historical re-enactment of a ""protest album"": the government is watching you, America eats its young, etc. The coffeehouse Afrocentrism of <i>Baduizm</i> was wiped out by producers like Madlib and Dilla, whose collage style is as forward-thinking as it is backward-looking.</p>
<p><i>New Amerykah Two</i>,<i> </i>by comparison, is a return to the kind of music Badu was making in 2003: relaxed, personal funk that scans more like a sketchbook than an album. Considering this album was being promised as soon as <i>Part One</i> came out, I can imagine someone getting pissy at the inclusion of minute-long half-thoughts like ""Agitation"" and ""You Loving Me (Session)"", but... so what? They're funny, memorable, and most importantly, they're <i>hers</i>. And her ability to toe the line between sounding effortless and sounding tossed-off is remarkable-- it illustrates the big, variable personality she's always claiming to have. My least favorite song here is actually the one that sounds like she's really trying: the 10-minute, multi-part ""Out My Mind, Just in Time"".</p>
<p>Most of the lyrics here dwell on relationships, which Badu handles with a confidence and informality that most of square-ass, tax-filing society just hasn't caught up to and probably never will. (""Had two babies, different dudes,"" she sang on 2008's ""Me""-- ""and for them both my love is true."") Badu wants a window seat and nobody sitting next to her. Badu is fucking your friends and laughs about it. There's satire, too-- ""Turn Me Away (Get Munny)"", where she plays a vapid nag who just decided she really, really loves you. There's a song actually called ""Fall in Love (Your Funeral)"". But despite the breadth of attitudes toward love, there's no angst, which makes it an uplifting experience-- it's like Badu is <i>actually convinced</i> that life goes on.</p>
<p>There's stuff here that is empty excess-- about three minutes of ""Love"", for example, or the drowsy instrumental ""Incense"" (basically a collaboration between Madlib and harpist Kirsten Agnesta). But for the most part I appreciate the ease of the album-- it's really the first time I feel like I'm understanding her, actually. Her art is her life, and her life-- like anyone's-- is too messy and varied to contain. Whether or not it's her responsibility to distill and make sense of it all is beside the point. To invoke Badu logic, <i>Part Two</i> just is what it is-- a coherent expression of a big, scattered personality.</p></div>"|14095.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14095-new-amerykah-part-two-return-of-the-ankh/|8.0|Mike Powell

Harlem are an Austin three-piece that opt out of messing with fuzz pedals and wear their grime on their sleeve instead. You might say they rub some people the wrong way. Their first record's title, <i>Free Drugs</i>, was punctuated with the following, ironically placed emoticon: ;-) Their band name doesn't do them any favors with the more politically correct. Their current press bio reads as though it came to its author on PCP, nonsense slapped together solely to give hapless music journalists migraines. :-( Their live set is comprised of as much on-stage, intra-band ribbing as their jukebox rock'n'roll. But they do seem to care deeply about one thing, and that's their songwriting.</p>
<p>A garage band studied in the ways of <i>Nuggets</i> but clearly enamored with Pixies, they are committed to crafting bubblegum choruses flavored with booze and cigarettes. <i>Hippies</i>, their Matador debut, showcases just how strong that commitment is from the opening bell. On ""Someday Soon"", sometime-frontman Michael Coomer runs us through an exchange in which his friend catches fire and asks for a little help being extinguished. The pleas are ultimately declined for kicks. It's sick but singable, the Nirvana-nodding ""Torture Me"" one other deliciously dark example. Coomer shares time playing guitar and drums with co-founder Curtis O'Mara, the two halving songwriting/guitar/lead vocal duties. The split provides a duality in tenor that does the record some serious good. When Curtis is in charge, as he is during the psychotropic shimmy of ""Faces"" or Casper tribute ""Friendly Ghost"", the bent is relatively hopeful. If the strep-throated Coomer has the reins, expect thunderstorms.</p>
<p>If <i>Hippies</i> has a flaw, it's only that it overstays its welcome by just a few minutes. By the time highway mood piece ""Prairie My Heart"" runs its haunting, three-minute course, it feels like an opportunity is missed to wrap things up. But then again, if you look at the way they've stacked hook on top of hook on top of hook, each so dangerously close to one another, it becomes clear that this is a singles parade more than an album. Also, ""Stripper Sunset"" jams awfully hard. It's pervy, but man does it ever jam.</p></div>"|14093.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14093-hippies/|8.1|David Bevan

That album was chopped up, according to Stones Throw, by the Predicate Production Guild, a semi-mysterious electronic artist believed to be an alter-ego of Savath head Guillermo Scott Herren (who also goes by Prefuse 73).  <i>The Predicate</i> sounds even cloudier and less focused than the already cloudy <i>La Llama</i>, with Herren removing its thin structures and leaving the remains in a worryingly unkempt mound.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Savath moniker has long been Herren's outlet for exploring Brazilian folk and psych with longtime Savath collaborator Eva Puyuelo Muns (<i>La Llama</i> also featured beatmaker Roberto Carlos Lange), but <i>The Predicate</i> doesn't sound like anything quite so well defined. Where ""La Loba"" was once a delicate, atmospheric ballad, ""La Loba Collection"" cuts and obscures the original's vocals and instrumentation, leaving only what can be described as general ambience. Sometimes, Herren takes <i>La Llama</i>'s least evolved tracks-- such as the clanky, beatless interlude ""Pajaros En Cadaques""-- and turns them into full-fledged compositions.  There are two different versions of the already collage-y ""Me Voy"" (the second, a teary eyed cinematic take, is gorgeous). The long, lumbering ""There Is No Love in Your Heart"" is a new composition, unless it's not; it can be very difficult to tell.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Unfortunately, none of it sticks. The lack of boundaries-- between sounds, between songs, even between <i>The Predicate</i> and its source material-- doesn't do Savath's electro-folk any favors. Traditional dub edits often emphasize rhythm, but it's unclear what Herren's emphasizing on <i>The Predicate</i>, other than the atmospheric looseness already present on <i>La Llama</i>. Its best moments (""Me Voy Alone"", ""Abri.L Closed"") sound like a textured, electronic takes on the Savath sound, incorporating some of the dilapidated breakbeats and implied sexuality of Herren's Prefuse 73 work. But <i>La Llama</i> had already begun to incorporate some of this noisy ephemera, and so <i>The Predicate</i> meanders, prettily, without ever gaining a foothold.</p></div>"|14099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14099-the-predicate-dub-version/|5.7|Andrew Gaerig

Once a band who incorporated dusty electronics and odd instruments in sweetly bizarre folk songs, Tunng now record folk songs that are sweetly... sweet. That's an indictment, but less of one than it seems. Tunng's fourth album, ...<i>And Then We Saw Land</i>, contains few of the appealing crevices and pocks of their early work, but sees them developing as songwriters.</p>
<p>It's fitting that <i>Saw Land</i> is coming out within weeks of reissues of albums by the Incredible String Band, another British folk band that was always weirder in concept than reality. Tunng probably never deserved the laborious mini-genres they've been tagged with, as they fit neatly in a tradition of British bands who have a slightly warped take on pastoral folk. <i>Saw Land</i> features stronger songwriting than the too-even <i>Good Arrows</i>, which in retrospect feels like a transitional album. The increased presence of Becky Jacobs' vocals further separates <i>Saw Land</i> from Tunng's mumble-y, bookish albums.</p>
<p>Tunng still employ electronics, but instead of scattering them throughout the mix, here they construct gentle, noticeable grooves. ""Sashimi"", <i>Saw Land</i>'s hookiest track, opens with a fervent acoustic guitar, one that eventually shares space with a chiming rhythmic loop.  It's probably the closest Tunng have ever sounded to MOR indie rock, which might say more about the prevalence of folk and electronic elements in modern indie than it does about Tunng's transition.</p>
<p><i>Saw Land</i> moves between the gentle, accented folk-pop that has become Tunng's calling card (""Hustle"", ""Weekend Away"") and songs that seem burlier, or more obviously structured (""Don't Look Down or Back"", which features big group choruses and ornery electric guitars). This mix leaves Tunng in an awkward spot, audience-wise: they seem a bit too Grizzly Bear for the avant-folk crowd and probably too weird and British for the Grizzly Bear crowd. Only during ""The Roadside"" does the band truly find balance: Curlicues of guitar, vocals, piano, and percussion move in and out of frame. Its sounds are full and beautiful, but the structure is skewed and out of focus.</p>
<p>""The Roadside"" seems like something to build on, but doing so will require Tunng to move away from the more rigid structures they've adopted on their last two albums. No one should begrudge them their cleaner, smoother sound, but straight-laced songwriting has sapped the band's well-worn eccentricities. Tunng have outgrown and outlasted the restrictive genres they were once boxed into, but <i>Saw Land</i> struggles to find its place in a larger context.</p></div>"|14101.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14101-and-then-we-saw-land/|5.8|Andrew Gaerig

There's ANT as veteran Rhymesayers superproducer, Heiruspecs as the Roots-analogue live band, Doomtree as the sprawling backpacker/punk collective, and dozens of crews plying everything from bring-88-back classicism to glossy electro. An up-and-coming producer specializing in an RJD2-style blend of keyboards and breaks wouldn't be considered an anomaly in this environment, but he might not stick out, either.</p>
<p>Not that Mike Swoop's relative (and likely temporary) underexposure holds back his ambition. <i>New Love</i>, his self-released debut, has a distinct stylistic focus-- cratedigger-friendly 1970s soul jazz. Swoop makes up for his lack in envelope-pushing with a fine-tuned ear for classic downtempo atmosphere. You can gauge the album's musical sensibilities by picking out some of the more recognizable samples-- flourishes drawn from Fantastic Plastic Machine's psychedelic lounge synths on ""Fiend"", the same slick Gato Barbieri jazz-funk that Devin the Dude's ""She Useta Be"" mined on ""Artisan"", or a skank rhythm sourced from Steely Dan's foray into reggae on ""Spread It Thin"".</p>
<p>But those are mostly foundations rather than the main focus of Swoop's productions. The album's persona of relaxed intensity truly thrives where his own contributions come in. Swoop builds on vinyl-sourced samples with his own multi-tracked percussion, bass, and keyboards, which form a seamless rapport with the music he takes both loops and inspiration from. The vibraphone-tinged ""Up Late"" recalls Roy Ayers at his Ubiquity-era peak, while ""Gain"" and ""On My Mind"" split the difference between Marvin Gaye's more lavish productions and the underground soul and fusion artists who followed. Even then, it's not a fastidious recreation of a faded, decades-old atmosphere; clean-cut tracks like the subtly Afrobeat-indebted ""No Go Die!"" and the cotton-candy Bernie Worrell-isms of ""No Room"" still have
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
the shine of the new on them.</p>
<p>It's compelling stuff, the kind of thing old Native Tongues fans would do themselves a favor to listen to-- and that goes double for the tracks that actually feature rapping. The artists responsible for two of the Twin Cities' best hip-hop albums of 2009 provide their own highlights, with Big Quarters' evocative daily-grind verses on ""Fiend"" and Toki Wright's psychological struggle between defeatism and survival lending gravity to the blunted sizzle of ""Let It Go"". And Kavorkian &amp; Allpurpose, the MCs from Swoop's Diametrix crew, sound haunting over the shimmering guitars of ""Where Do We Go?"", a complementary study in late-night anxiety that proves Swoop can find the ideal beat to draw out a rapper's unique qualities. If there are more instrumental jams where this came from, Mike Swoop will have a deep, devoted following in Minneapolis for years to come. If there's a dedicated, full-length producer/MC teamup in his future, even better.</p></div>"|14060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14060-new-love/|7.3|Nate Patrin

As the lead singer of Sigur Rós, he's starred in several of this century's most epic songs; with their penchant for instrumental swells, feedback, and weight-of-humanity wails, the Icelandic band has practically set a new, near unreachable height for melodramatic art rock. But after perfecting this style on 2005's <i>Takk</i>, Jónsi and his mates have had some trouble finding a way out from beneath the burden of big. Their last album, 2008's <i>Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust</i>, tried to temper the bombast but occasionally got bogged down in aimless balladry. Jónsi's subsequent <i>Riceboy Sleeps</i> LP with Alex Somers offered largely voiceless ambiance, akin to Quentin Tarantino directing a silent chamber drama. But with his solo debut, Jónsi fights huge with huger.</p>
<p>Helping to realize the mini symphonies in the singer's head are two key collaborators: pianist, composer, and arranger Nico Muhly-- who has become the <i>de facto</i> solution for artists like Grizzly Bear and Antony and the Johnsons when in need of unique, showy flourishes-- and Finnish percussionist Samuli Kosminen, who can be seen literally banging on old suitcases in an in-studio video on Jónsi's website. The conspirators balance well; though Muhly's manicured arrangements could have come off stiff in this context, their combination with Kosminen's unbridled wallops brings the orchestration dizzily whirling forth. But what truly elevates <i>Go</i> is Jónsi's voice, which still has the ability to stun a decade after <i>Agætis Byrjun</i> introduced most listeners to his alien bleats.</p>
<p>Along with Jeff Buckley and Thom Yorke, Jónsi's pipes have set the standard for modern eunuch-like crooning. And on <i>Go</i>, he makes up for the lack of vocals on <i>Riceboy Sleeps</i> by working overtime, backing himself up to create a Jónsi choir, offering skyrocketing counter-melodies, and even making the occasional bird sound. He beams ecstatically on ""Go Do"", cracks hearts on the string-laden ""Sinking Friendships"", and comes as close as he probably ever will to rapping on ""Animal Arithmetic"". He may lack Buckley's soulfulness or Yorke's infinite melancholy, but Jónsi's distinguishing trait is an innocence that helps make emotions sound fresh. This child-like view is more apparent on <i>Go</i> because it finds the singer mostly expressing himself in plain English rather than his usual combination of heavenly vowel sounds and Icelandic.<br/><br/>On the surface, the language breakthrough is irrelevant; whatever you thought he was singing about before is probably close to what he's singing about in English here. For instance, the hook on ""Go Do"" goes, ""<span class=""mediumtxt"">We should always know that we can do anything</span>."" Of course it's corny, but Jónsi's sincere intent makes the feel-good anthem feel good. Images of nature come up often, which makes sense considering his gale force lungs. Even when he comes close to ""Legend of Zelda"" territory, like when he sings of <span class=""mediumtxt"">""<span class=""mediumtxt"">a treasure chest full of labyrinths""</span></span> on ""Around Us"", his committment and wide-eyed naivety go a long way. In Jónsi's universe, cynicism has yet to be invented.</p>
<p>Much of <i>Go</i> matches the uplift of Sigur Rós at their most dramatic. There's more sonic density here than ever-- <i>Go</i>'s cacophony of  flutes, piano, horns, strings, and bird calls beg for a 5.1 mix. At the  same time, the songwriting is pruned down. The usual crescendos  spring up in condensed bursts, rather than being spread out over seven  minutes. And Jónsi seems to be getting less murky and moody as he collects years. Still, <i>Go</i> isn't pure escapist Peter Pan theater. ""No one knows you 'til it's over,"" he yowls on ""<span class=""mediumtxt"">Sinking Friendships""</span>, ""you know no one true 'til it's over."" For Jónsi, life and death are spoken in mythic, uncompromising terms.

They make soul music in the classic sense, the kind of tracks that might have been laid down in Memphis, Muscle Shoals, Detroit, Philadelphia, or Chicago in the late 1960s and early 70s. But there's more to their sound than a nostalgia trip-- it's an affirmation of the validity of working in specific styles, even ones most people stopped exploring decades ago.</p>
<p>The Dap-Kings succeed through attention to detail. While a lot of music makes aesthetic or stylistic nods to 60s, almost none of it actually captures the sonic character of the era. But on each of their albums, Jones and her collaborators, led by Gabriel Roth, have done just that. And it doesn't just come down to the production and placement of the microphones. Jones deserves the most credit, simply for having an amazing voice that she understands how to wield effectively. Her impeccable sense of delivery balances power with nuance, varying her forcefulness for maximum impact. The songs give her plenty of room to move, too-- if these tracks weren't every bit as good as the ones that inspired them, all of the performance and production acumen in the world couldn't save them. As rote as it sounds, ""Better Things"" and ""The Game Gets Old"", among others on <i>I Learned the Hard Way</i>, would likely be classics today if they'd been released alongside the music that influenced them. In fact, they may yet become classics to a smaller, more niche audience today.</p>
<p>""Better Things"" in particular is incredible, a brilliant kiss-off in which Jones reveals layers of anguish beneath her anger, while the band supports her with a heavy Muscle Shoals-style groove. It's striking to listen back to the very basic pastiche of the band's first album and see how far they've come, exploring different corners of funk and soul, experimenting with different meters and very complex arrangements. The trumpet in the intro to ""Better Things"" plays around with the vocal melody with a jazzy slyness that hits even harder when Jones follows it up by taking it over. Elsewhere, the horns and stormy backing track on ""Money"" save it from being a pretty typical soul rumination on being down and out, while Jones grabs the surfish guitar and bounding beat of ""She Ain't a Child No More"" and runs with them, delivering a commanding vocal to which her bandmates dutifully respond.</p>
<p>It all comes together to make an album that stands up as a varied and well-sequenced work, and as a collection of songs you can scatter through a shuffle and dig just as deeply. It's nice to hear the band really stretch themselves and develop the drama and tumult of songs like ""I'll Still Be True"" and ""The Game Gets Old"", which you can really hear the band putting its creative all the way into. This record hardly needs to be recommended to soul fans, but even if revisitations of older music styles aren't usually your thing, <i>I Learned the Hard Way</i> is worth digging up.</p></div>"|14085.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14085-i-learned-the-hard-way/|8.0|Joe Tangari

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Between 1987 and 1993, Pixies released four records and one EP that changed indie music. Between 1993 and the present, Pixies singer Black Francis (aka Frank Black, formerly Charles Thompson, now Black Francis again) has released over a dozen discs under various names and with various collaborators-- some more noteworthy than others, but none changing much of anything. Indeed, changing things hasn't seemed to be part of his agenda-- if not with his first band, then certainly not since, as his solo releases and side projects tend to look more to the past for inspiration than to the future.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Not even the celebrated Pixies comeback<span> could</span> slow his prolific pace. In fact, he's practically doubled his output since the group reunited in the spring of '04. In February, he released a five-disc box set and book for his score to the 1920 silent film <i>The Golem</i>. And now, two short months later, we have <i>NonStopErotik</i>. Like so many of his other releases, the album was recorded quickly and ad hoc with frequent co-conspirator/producer Eric Drew Feldman. And while it won't make you forget the Pixies, some of it seems specifically designed to bring them to mind.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Perhaps logically, Black Francis seems to have no qualms connecting his current output with his formative work. ""Six Legged Man"" feels like it comes from the same place as <i>Trompe Le Monde</i>, and the dreamy déjà vu gait of ""O My Tidy Sum"" hits a similarly comforting sweet spot (drum machine, electric piano and fake strings or no).<span> In fact, from ""Dead Man's Curve"" to ""Lake of Sin"" to the not-quite-as-icky-as-you-might-expect ""When I Go Down On You"", few songwriters are as adept at deviously slipping as many changes into relatively concise songs without calling attention to their tricks. It's a stealth trademark: instantly recognizable when you hear it but harder than you think to replicate.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Yet even when Black plays it straight, the results still sometimes skew. If the younger Black Francis might have transformed a cover of the Flying Burrito Brothers' ""Wheels"" into a cool surf epic
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
rather than a Velvet Underground-inspired reconstruction, the elder delivers an intriguing mix of vitality and cool detachment. It's easy to take those seemingly at-odds qualities for granted, but here Black Francis sounds not just comfortable with that aesthetic but surprisingly and paradoxically in control of it as well.</span></p>

If ever there were an under-appreciated, defunct indie rock band deserving of a second wind, it's the Glaswegian foursome who disbanded in the mid-2000s after five critically acclaimed but commercially ignored albums. However, founding member Emma Pollock may not be so eager to give into the lure of easy nostalgia and big festival guarantees, given the encouraging evolution of her solo career. Where her winsome 2007 solo debut <i>Watch the Fireworks</i> saw Pollock operating well within the Delgados' orchestral pop comfort zone, <i>The Law of Large Number</i><i>s</i> takes a more deconstructive tack, gradually breaking down the standard rock band formation to experiment with texture and rhythm, and establish a more absorbing, nocturnal atmosphere.</p>
<p>Pollock's voice is so consistent in its matter-of-fact assertiveness that she can afford to take structural liberties without sacrificing personality. Never one to resort to maudlin sentiment or theatrical vamping to get her point across, Pollock frequently manipulates rhythm to frame her pointed portraits of relationship malaise, whether playing up the confessional tension of ""Red Orange Green"" with a metronomic tick-tock track, or illustrating the post-breakup confusion of ""The Loop"" with a flurry of vibraphone tones and harmonic vocal tics. Even when her ambition overshadows the execution, as with the gratuitous Dixieland dressing of ""Nine Lives"", Pollock still has inspiration to spare, as she eventually cuts through the song's smoky jazz bar haze with an invigorating, group-march denouement.<br/><br/><i>The Law of Large Numbers</i> is a smartly sequenced record, following a dusk-to-dawn trajectory that begins on familiar ground (""I Could Be a Saint"" boasts a grand, Delgados-worthy sing-along chorus) and descends into solitary, dead-of-night piano pieces (""House on the Hill"") before embarking on the long, lonely walk toward morning-after redemption, with the pulse of ""Chemistry Will Find Me"" charting that journey one heavy footstep at the time. The interpersonal narratives laid out over the course of<i> Large Numbers</i> do not culminate in a tidy, conciliatory conclusion or moment of celebration; rather, the album's open-ended quality more accurately reflects the sense of uncertainty and aimlessness we all feel in the wake of a broken relationship. That Pollock recorded this album with her husband (fellow ex-Delgado Paul Savage) only makes her strengths as a storyteller all the more apparent.</p></div>"|14096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14096-the-law-of-large-numbers/|7.5|Stuart Berman

Despite learning how to play their instruments in different ways, Christy and Emily both approach them with a sense of experimentation and curiosity. They want to see what sorts of sounds they can make with them, how to exploit those sounds, how to make something musical from noises that seemingly sound non-musical. It's no coincidence then that for their latest album, <i>No Rest</i>, they chose a producer who knows a little something about exploratory shenanigans: Faust co-founder (and Klangbad co-owner) Hans Joachim Irmler.</p>
<p><i>No Rest</i> sounds best when the group serves these adventurous impulses; yet when C&amp;E play it straight, their songs suffer. These lackluster moments often occur when focus is shifted from the music to voice and words. Both Christy and Emily have indistinct yet sweet voices that work together well. However, they're often paired with simple-to-a-fault lyrics (see the hokey folky ""Sundowners"" or the equally rustic ""Idle Hands""), which does neither them nor listeners any favors. Sometimes, the music can overcome these shortcomings, as on ""Firefly"", whose minute-plus bookends of guitar and gently descending Wurlitzer makes up for C&amp;E's breathless vocals and repetitive lyrics. The enjoyable approximation of third-album Velvets on ""Beast"", the lovely duet between electric piano and violin on ""Guava Tree"", and the stuttering organ-like loop behind ""Kings &amp; Monsters"" help make the wordy missteps bearable.</p>
<p>Thankfully, C&amp;E often create vast and evocative spaces that do the talking for them. And on their best songs, the lyrics benefit from exacting discipline. Instead of wearing a pencil down to a nub trying to find an answer to a line like, ""What if there's no fire where there's smoke"" (from ""Little World""), they simply sketch around its edges and let the listener fill in the blanks. Album closer ""Amaryllis"" is the best of these, abetting the haunting Medieval player-piano melody with quiet, amelodic guitar and fragmented lyrics. When the song returns to its more atmospheric portion, however, the contrast provided by the sped-up interlude helps to make its coda that much more unsettling.</p>
<p>In this light, it's not surprising that they chose to cover Tom Brosseau's ""Here Comes the Water Now"". It's a charming tune that ably displays Brosseau's conversational wit, as well as his way with an arrangement. Christy &amp; Emily simplify the already spare song even further, letting the its lyrics and melody proudly stand on their own. And while this cover serves as a fitting tribute to Brosseau's talents, it also seems to serve as a blueprint for what Christy &amp; Emily ultimately want to achieve in their own songs. <i>No Rest</i> is still more uneven that one would hope, but it's a definite step in the right direction.</p>

Few hearts could. So begins <i>The Wonder Show of the World</i>, the Kentucky sage's first tandem outing with guitarist/Cairo Gang chief Emmett Kelly. Historically, the former has always displayed wolverine instincts when it comes to selecting creative partners, and this is no exception. In addition to beautiful contributions on both <i>The Letting Go </i>and <i>Lie Down in the Light</i>, Kelly's furnished a sturdy CV exploring folk music's boundaries on his own. As a pair, Kelly and Oldham are a very natural fit. Amongst the shadows and amber, ambient hook of ""Troublesome Houses"", his voice and Oldham's fold into one another like lovers. The rest of their trip is as inviting as that first step.</p>
<p><i>The Wonder Show of the World</i> is a perfectly titled look at the ways in which we all tangle ourselves up with one another-- as friends, fathers, mothers, daughters, wives, husbands, and on and on. All of Oldham's takes on love and companionship here are worth the price of admission, but what makes the album really stick is the way each tale is mirrored by its sonics. Spontaneity still being Oldham's jam, this is a clear move away from the country-based records of recent years, and this record's much more about space and on-tape interaction than it is any strain of American sound. Whether the arrangement is full-bodied or spare, upended folk or gospel, you can really sense that these two are reacting to one another as though the song's coming to them for the very first time. Kelly's guitar work here spans a long list of genres, gathering ingredients from blues, jazz, country, and Spanish guitar. And no matter the flavor, Kelly does well to buttress Oldham's zigs and zags, never overwhelming any of his verses. He just lets him do his thing and vice versa.</p>
<p>This is arguably Oldham's most austere record to date, but there's much to dig into. From the aforementioned opener onward, the first half is quiet fire. In ""Teach Me to Bear You"", Oldham gets down on his knees and begs for honest answers from a woman, combining with Kelly for some gorgeous church vocals before the latter tears open a blues solo that'd make John Mayer sweat. Much less direct, ""With Cornstalks or Among Them"" is a rapturous, reverb-y showcase for Oldham's singing voice, which has only continued to evolve along with his eye for erotic detail. On ""The Sounds Are Always Begging"", Oldham awakes to his wife chopping up their bed, his dick too hard for him to be scared. That line's inclusion feels like a total put-on, but the album's most memorable doesn't at all: During the ""That's What Our Love Is"", a seven-minute centerpiece, Oldham wails to his lover that the smell of her ""box"" is still on his mustache. It's as intimate and daring a note as any songwriter could make, the kind of observation that leaves you slackjawed. But not just because it throws your balance or because he isn't Lil Wayne, but because few songwriters feel so comfortable going there. In full, this outing feels as close to that sentiment as any. Not just comfortable-- honest.</p></div>"|14088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14088-the-wonder-show-of-the-world/|7.4|David Bevan

Marling possessed an undeniable knack for writing about young love with directness and authentic feeling, but at times her pseudo-profound poetics suggested the young folkie was in too much of a hurry to be a serious adult.</p>
<p>Clearly, I significantly underestimated Laura Marling's capabilities. Her sophomore effort, <i>I Speak Because I Can</i>, finds Marling, still only 20, shrugging off virtually all traces of girlishness and wide-eyed charm, instead delving into darkly elemental, frequently morbid folk. And yet, astonishingly, the expected growing pains never come. To say Marling evinces wisdom beyond her years on <i>I Speak</i> would be a criminal understatement, considering she's created a haunting, fully flowered gem of an album despite being younger than two-thirds of the Jonas Brothers.</p>
<p>These are folk-rock songs, but Marling doesn't lazily trade on it like so many other would-be old souls. Instead, like Fairport Convention or Nick Cave or Cat Power, she uses folk as an archetypal form to get at the essential realities of love, sex, heartbreak, and death. Sometimes she does it with heart-stopping quietness, her voice dropping to conversational tones on ""Made by Maid"" and ""What He Wrote"". Just as often, Marling sets her allegories to raucous musical accompaniment, an especially impressive feat considering the calm of her debut. The bluesy jig of opener and first single ""Devil's Spoke"" might elicit a few less-than-ideal comparisons with KT Tunstall, but Marling blows that kind of politely insistent stuff out of the water on the soaring, thunderous ""Rambling Man"" and the gypsy-ish breakdown of ""Alpha Shallows"" (which makes up for that song's momentary slip into sub-Dylan poetic doggerel).</p>
<p>It would have been all too easy for an album like this, so grimly fixated and coming from someone of such tender age, to be written off as the work of a morose young Romantic. However, Marling seems to have a great deal of self-awareness of her melancholic bent, lightly skewering herself on ""Goodbye England (Covered in Snow)"" for writing an ""epic letter"" to an estranged lover that's ""22 pages front and back/ But it's too good to be used."" And yet, she's not playing dress-up. She's a wholly developed artist in full command of gifts that may not yet be finished arriving.</p></div>"|14075.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14075-i-speak-because-i-can/|8.1|Joshua Love

Scuba has done this both through his own work and through his stewardship of the almost bulletproof Hotflush label, home to 2009's nominally dubstep breakouts by Mount Kimbie and Joy Orbison. On <i>Triangulation</i>, Scuba continues his label's thrilling run with a proper full-length of fluid, melodic dubstep that sounds beautiful and aggressive in equal measure.</p>
<p>If Scuba's name doesn't resonate quite like those of his labelmates, it's likely because through one full-length (2008's <i>A Mutual Antipathy</i>) and an armful of singles, Scuba has yet to stumble into one breakout track (his remix of his own ""Hard Boiled"", under his SCB moniker, came closest). Scuba tracks tend to fall into one of two camps: bass-heavy thumpers or slow, melodic cut-ups that often sound like dubstep's version of a ballad.  Scuba's dance numbers have a tendency to lie in the weeds and lurk; where a song like ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11461-hyph-mngo/"" target=""_blank"">Hyph Mngo</a>"" sounds like a siren, Scuba's are the glue that hold a mix together. (See: DJ /rupture subtly weaving Scuba's ""Braille Diving"" into the second half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12371-uproot/"" target=""_blank""><i>Uproot</i></a>.)</p>
<p>This seamless construction defines <i>Triangulation</i>. What Scuba lacks as a dance hit-maker he makes up for with careful pacing and an ever-present tension between dark, tech-y sounds and inviting melodicism. These sorts of daring sleight-of-hand tricks are Scuba's specialty. ""Before"" sounds like Boards of Canada covering modern R&amp;B, and it leads into ""Tracers"", a pounding, industrial-strength romp.  ""So You Think You're Special"" plasters an echoing, hopeful loop (""Here you'll find the one/ Here in the sun"") over ominous, pulsing bass. It's not a comedown so much as club music for those who never make it out of the apartment.</p>
<p>Had ""dubstep"" never entered the lexicon, it would be easy enough to label <i>Triangulation</i> house music, but without the implied build-ups or ecstasy. <i>Triangulation</i> ultimately falls into the dubstep camp because of its mood and temperament. By expertly juxtaposing the dark with the romantic, the hectic with the serene, Scuba's produced a triumphant, balanced album. It's also one that can feel too well adjusted. It's easy to hear parts of <i>Triangulation</i> as clay for bridging DJ sets or potent source material for remixers. But <i>Triangulation</i> is also worthy of attention in its own right, a cohesive record whose complications lurk just under its surface.</p></div>"|14076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14076-triangulation/|8.2|Andrew Gaerig

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The self-released <i>Outbursts </i>mostly operates on a scale reminiscent of their humble beginnings-- frantically strummed acoustics, dewy lead guitar, close harmonies, and an occasional spit shine of synthesizer. Weirdly though it's actually as unsettling as the new Liars album.<span> Not s</span>onically-- it's nobody's idea of edgy; yet thanks to Olly Knight's lyrics, the listener is perpetually wondering whether he can make it through the next 10 seconds without saying something stupid.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The list of Knights' clunkers is long and distinguished and he honors tradition here, never failing to pockmark perfectly decent folk-rock with anti-quotables that pop up with even greater frequency than in the past-- the longing slide guitar and sparkling major-7th chords of ""Paper Heart"" give way to Knights testing the limits of to what ""paper"" can be applied as an adjective (worlds, girls, boys, toys) and dropping knowledge like ""I live by the sea/ Not the one you're thinking / The sea inside of me.""<span> </span>""Rocket Song"" goes for the endlessly skyward grandiosity of Jeff Buckley's ""Hallelujah"" and comes up with ""You're a bruise upon the brain/ I lay my cards down on the grain/ Slowly bursting into flame/ Then you leave me smoking in the rain.""<span> </span>""The Invitation"" creeps on the kind of kenning, baroque chord progression used in Radiohead's piano ballads, but stumbles over pick-up lines lke ""I hail from an old-fashioned dream/ I'm outside your window making a scene.""<span> </span>At one point he says he's the ""ruler of this Internet.""<span> </span>I have no idea what that means.<span> </span>Maybe I should consult Paul Wall.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Opening salvo ""Sea Change"" warns of a non-specific danger that has ""six billion backs against the wall"" and its final-countdown lyric is actually somewhat cleverly constructed.<span> </span>But then they flesh out the mix with incompatible disco strings and bongos that go for that ""funky mixed meter"" vibe and just end up sounding hilariously off-beat.<span> </span>Nothing on <i>Outbursts </i>turns out to overblown sonically, but ""Sea Change"" does signal a straining quality that runs throughout the album. Past highlights like ""Underdog"" and ""Future Boy"" hinted at a sense of humor and scrappy charm; yet no matter how stripped down or underwritten they sound these days, Turin Brakes still always come off like they're actually <i>really </i>trying, which is the saddest part about it.</p>

Their obscurity is at least somewhat deliberate. In all this time, they have not toured or participated in any typical promotional activity, preferring to pour their creative energy into ambitious studio recordings. The group is led by singer and primary songwriter Joshua Babcock, a man with a seemingly endless appetite for old-school psychedelia, science fiction, and head shop ephemera. Babcock's best compositions blur the lines between many strains of 1960s and 70s pop and exotica, coming together on albums that sound like either an alternate version of the past, or an older version of the future.</p>
<p><br/>Up until 2003, the Society was known as the Shimmer Kids Underpop Association. The core personnel remained mostly the same, but the tone of the band's music changed, or at least it did for their first two releases under the name. Whereas the Shimmer Kids records had a bright, poppy tone characterized by Beach Boys harmonies and whirring theremin, the initial Society of Rockets albums were slower and more subdued. They were going for a sort of spacey country-rock thing, but ended up with tunes that felt flat and listless compared to the colorful whimsy of their older material. Their 2007 album <i>Our Paths Related</i> was more interesting, but their experiments with hard psyche grooves and funky horn flourishes were a poor fit for Babcock's reedy voice.<br/><br/>Thankfully, their latest record is a return to form. <i>Future Factory</i> sprawls out over four vinyl sides-- it's not being released on CD-- and finds Babcock and his collaborators reclaiming the sunny ba-da-ba tunefulness of their early days while successfully integrating elements from krautrock and bossa nova. The album sequence is punctuated with interstitial song fragments that shift mood, provide texture, and capture brief moments of inspiration that require no further elaboration. At just under an hour, it's generous but not overlong, and its restless spirit and variety of tones keep the music from falling into the samey ruts of previous Society of Rockets releases. <br/><br/>The group sound genuinely thrilled and engaged by these songs, and that spark results in some of the finest recordings of the band's overall history. ""Circulate and Sing"" and ""I Am a Battery"" blend chiming British Invasion chords with delirious, hazy synthesizers. ""We"" recalls early Stereolab with its super-charged motorik groove, while ""The Great Experiment"" brings to mind that band's later excursions into zoned-out polyrhythmic lounge pop. ""Guess My Name"" nods in the direction of Hall &amp; Oates smooth, R&amp;B-inflected studio pop without a hint of kitschiness, while ""Blowout Chief"" is reminiscent of Guided By Voices in their mid-90s heyday. It's a pile-up of scattered influences and recycled ideas to be sure, but the execution is distinct. After years of seeming to chase after some kind of artistic growth, Babcock and his band have made the best album of their career by letting loose and playing to their strengths.</p></div>"|14087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14087-future-factory/|7.4|Matthew Perpetua

And that's not just burnout talking, the after-effects of one too many crappy ""all-star"" remix compilations designed to part fans from their money. <i>Sisterworld Reinterpretations</i> is not some cash-grab. Liars aren't that kind of band. Their music is already a fevered mash of disparate genres, perfect source material for ruthless remixing. <i>Reinterpretations</i> assembles arena rock celebs and art-rock lifers, weirdo club kids and zonked folkies. And Liars presumably instructed these peers, pals, and heroes to attack their music with gusto.</p>
<p>So why do the results sound so limp? The main problem is that few of these remixers seem to understand what makes Liars' music interesting in the first place. <i>Sisterworld</i> is an album of opposites: Brutal and weirdly tender. Pastoral and industrial. Musical and damn near unlistenable. It revels in good old fashioned tension and release, playing those opposites against one another, often within the same song. But the majority of these remixes flatten the tension and forget the release entirely. They limp (Kazu Makino) and skitter (Thom Yorke) and drone (Boyd Rice) along for three or four or five minutes. And then they end.</p>
<p>Way too many tracks are content to float along, inoffensively, recycling familiar sounds-- the pretty textures of ambient or the ugliness of free-form noise. They turn some of the most bracingly physical rock of the year into avant background music. Liars are certainly in love with sound and texture, the kind of otherworldly atmosphere you can create only in the studio. But stripped back to nothing <i>but</i> atmosphere-- without Liars' love for the heavy rhythms and metal guitars-- <i>Sisterworld</i> becomes as commonplace and dismissible as any second-rate ambient album or half-hearted noise performance.</p>
<p>In the case of, say, Melvins, this seems like missing the point to a perverse degree. Imagine the ass-flattening potential of a true Buzzo/Crover assault on the Liars' catalog. Instead we get plinks and plonks and feedback splutters and cheesy tape effects. The overall lack of effort on display is all the more disheartening given the general talent level involved. Tunde Adebimpe's cover (not remix) of ""Scarecrows on a Killer Slant"" sounds like a demo in preparation for a (hopefully better) full-band version: dull arrangement, sketchy backing track, lazy singing from a master. The lack of energy is almost startling when you compare it to the original, <i>Sisterworld</i>'s most violent song.</p>
<p>So, yes, most of <i>Reinterpretations</i> can be painlessly deleted. But it'd be foolish to toss out the bright spots out with the murky bathwater-- Atlas Sound's shimmering, Steve Reich-ish take on ""Here Comes All the People"" springs to mind. <i>Reinterpretations</i>' inconsistency is another reason to thank your god of choice for the 30-second MP3 preview, still the cherry-picking downloader's best friend.</p></div>"|14082.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14082-sisterworld-reinterpretations/|4.0|Jess Harvell

So wrote Pitchfork's Chris Ott in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/776-complete-recordings/"">his April 1999 review</a> of Black Tambourine's <i>Complete Recordings</i>, and at the time, the line sounded like wishful thinking. After all, that compilation of the Washington, D.C. band's brief, brilliant career didn't surface at the most opportune time for a reassessment, given pre-millennial indie rock's aesthetic drift away from fuzz-covered slop-pop toward exploratory instrumentals (Tortoise, Mogwai) and folky formalism (Belle and Sebastian, Elliott Smith). But the arrival of this reissue of that reissue-- which supplements the <i>Complete Recordings</i> tracklist with two demos and four unearthed tracks-- confirms that revisionist history is now real. Not only does it mark the 20th anniversaries of the band and its Slumberland imprint, but also the renewed ubiquity of Black Tambourine's sound in certain contemporary indie pop circles.</p>
<p>And yet even with their emergent iconic status, it's hard to say if Black Tambourine were ahead of their time or simply out of place. The music they created was novel not necessarily for its era-- forming in 1989, they essentially modeled themselves on the girl-group/post-punk collision instigated by the Jesus and Mary Chain and the C86 set-- but its point of origin, making them anomalies in a D.C. scene very much beholden to Dischord-schooled hardcore. Their history thus mirrors that of cult touchstones ranging from mid-60s <i>Nuggets</i> bands to Big Star: American Anglophiles operating in relative isolation, translating their out-of-step influences into flashes of inspired songcraft before quickly flaming out in a sigh of indifference, only to be survived by future generations of record-collecting converts.</p>
<p>If the 20-year-old songs compiled on <i>Black Tambourine</i> still sound strikingly contemporary, it probably has less to do with the band's own foresight and more to do with modern indie's retreat into lo-fi insularity. But so long as timid young rock bands choose to hide their innermost emotions behind a foggy veil of feedback, songs like the urgently despairing ""For Ex-Lovers Only"", the hypnotically propulsive ""By Tomorrow"", and the giddily expressed girlfriend murder fantasy ""Throw Aggi Off the Bridge"" will forever stand as paragons of the form.</p>
<p>That <i>Complete Recordings</i> has long gone out of print makes <i>Black Tambourine</i> an essential acquisition for current In the Red, Woodsist, and Slumberland loyalists. And even for old-school adherents, the bonus tracks included warrant a repurchase. Never mind the demos for ""Ex-Lovers"" and ""Aggi"", which merely present these already crudely rendered songs in more severe states of tape decay. The four previously unreleased tracks-- new recordings by the original line-up of old, undocumented set-list standards-- fit seamlessly alongside the vintage material both in terms of quality and fidelity: a pair of upbeat distorto-pop jaunts (""Lazy Heart"", ""Tears of Joy"") as immediately engaging as anything in their canon, plus raucous but reverential covers of Buddy Holly (""Heart Beat"") and Suicide (""Dream Baby Dream"") that map out the pop/drone polarities of Black Tambourine's sound world. For a band whose legend was initially built on two officially released singles, these quality extras should be more than enough to see us through to the 2030 reunion tour.</p></div>"|14074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14074-black-tambourine/|8.3|Stuart Berman

Three of its definitive bands-- the Notwist, Tied &amp; Tickled Trio, and Lali Puna-- share members, not to mention a knack for emotive electro-acoustic melodies. But each band has its own angle. The Notwist go for the broadest appeal, and tend to hit big or mildly miss. T&amp;T is the most obscure, in both style and profile. Lali Puna is the most polished and consistent. Their music is reserved, in a way that seems old-fashioned: more like Stereolab in the 1990s than the demonstrative electro-pop of today.</p>
<p>Lali Puna's first album in five years dials down the guitar from <i>Faking the Books</i>, although it's still there, along with live drums, creating an organic undertone. The music is sophisticated and low-impact, and makes you marvel that Lali Puna is ever described as an experimental band. That must come from their judicious use of vocal effects, like the shivering ""ohs"" looped on ""Remember"" and the underwater distortion of ""Everything Is Always"". But really, they never use any gestures that aren't entrenched in pop's vocabulary. The occasional skipping-record synths or trip-hop beats aren't cracking any heads open in 2010 either. They don't intend to. Instead, the electronic interventions strengthen the effortless-feeling melodies.</p>
<p>But there is something internal about <i>Our Inventions</i>. Valerie Trebeljahr's lyrics are well-turned and unobtrusive; they register and instantly dissolve. Paired with her unornamented vocal style, she blends seamlessly into her surroundings; her voice carries the same impact as the warm chord or tidy tone pattern idling beside it. The arrangements stick to an effective coast-and-surge model of development: The tracks skim low and then tilt upward with the addition of a drum or synth part. It's a stock trick that works well, and Lali Puna use it with unusual tact. They gently float up, drift down again, always arriving at the same coolly appealing place, regardless of whether they've loaded their framework with blown-out bass, IDM garbles, or tuned metal plinks. Large portions of songs by similar acts such as Stars, Au Revoir Simone, and Alaska in Winter can seem to exist solely to set up the big, memorable drop. Lali Puna are just as approachable, but less ingratiating. As a result, every moment matters, which has a curiously muting effect: No individual moment seems to matter especially much.</p></div>"|14041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14041-our-inventions/|6.5|Brian Howe

For one thing, the members all kept playing together. More importantly, each project that sprang up in the band's orbit and wake-- including Loftus, Califone, Orso, and Sin Ropas, as well as a lot of Brian Deck's production work-- carried on and expanded the band's aesthetic, making it a major part of the Chicago sound over the past decade. So Red Red Meat didn't so much die as fractalize. Sin Ropas, the project of former Red Red Meat bassist Tim Hurley, hasn't been as prolific as Califone, to which Hurley sometimes contributes, but their four albums have written interesting twists into Red Red Meat's noisy Americana legacy.</p>
<p><i>Holy Broken</i> comes five years after the band's third album, <i>Fire Prizes</i>, a record that sometimes sank under the weight of its own noisiness and strangely was a vinyl-only release in the U.S. Hurley and his primary partner in Sin Ropas, percussionist/multi-instrumentalist Danni Iosello, have come back from that break with their most direct and immediate album yet. That's not to say they've made a pop record-- this is still fuzzy indie rock that mixes noisier elements with acoustic folk instruments-- but they have left behind the long, slow, sludgy tracks of <i>Fire Prizes</i> for higher tempos, shorter songs, and brighter textures.</p>
<p>Outside of Hurley's overdriven guitar, one of the most prominent sounds on the album is the wordless two-part harmonies of Hurley and Iosello. Whether cutting through a grungy guitar buzzsaw or gently interacting with acoustic guitar, quiet organ, and wandering banjo, their harmonies are oddly consistent. Their sweetness also serves as a foil for Hurley's dusty croon on the lead vocals, which works well in the context of the band's sound, but nowhere better than on album opener ""The Fever You Fake"", a thick rocker built on a teetering fuzz riff that's spiked with candy-colored piano and the occasional counterintuitive solo.</p>
<p>One knock against the band is that their exceedingly basic vocal melodies tend to blur together, relying on the instrumental arrangements to differentiate them. That doesn't always work, but even on some of the slower, less dynamic songs that pad out the album, the band's sonic signature is strong. <i>Holy Broken</i> rests comfortably alongside <i>Trick Boxes on the Pony Line</i> among the best Sin Ropas releases and keeps a band that seemingly had faded away in the post-Red Red Meat conversation.</p></div>"|14052.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14052-holy-broken/|7.4|Joe Tangari

The end result is a cataloging of the fear and morbidity-- as well as the strange peacefulness and hope-- that permeates the sterile air of waiting rooms and ICUs. Sometimes they accomplish it by delivering a hardline narrative; sometimes by allowing the sheer melodrama of these fractured takes on anthemic ambient and shoegaze to do the heavy lifting. <i>Machines That Listen</i> occasionally suffers at the hands of it's own theatricality, but there's also a great deal of rich, real-life drama to latch onto here.</p>
<p>Ex-hip-hoppers David Bolt and Craig Gordon (plus bassist Karrie K) clearly have a keen eye for the histrionic, offering vivid peeks into the lives of the characters that haunt the record, from a parting bedside moment between a husband and wife on ""And the Radio Played On"" to the disquieting experience of the waiting room on ""A Room for Waiting"". But where these little vignettes often falter, the Delta Mirror have the good sense to reinforce the storytelling with interesting soundscapes. Often taking a flood of lush melodies and dense tones and augmenting them with craggly electronics, undulating bass lines, and soft thuds and ticks, it's the music that shoulders most of the sentimental heft. Celestial opener ""It Was Dark and I Welcome the Calm"" and highlight ""We Got It All"" help better to conceptualize the hospital's blend of the ominous and the peaceful.</p>
<p>Despite its heart, the music is so mechanized (save for the occasional piano suite), right down to its title. <i>Machines That Listen </i>suggest that these stories are somehow being translated by the machines themselves (though thankfully never going so far as to insert, say, the sounds of an EKG machine), with each disconnected stutter or pained guitar yowl inching closer to something innately organic. Often fogging the human vocals, this android-like device also gives the album's stories a new shape. But whatever the read, <i>Machines That Listen</i> is a patient, layered piece that offers a deeply romantic-- and occasionally oddly reaffirming-- take on experiences often written off as purely antiseptic.</p></div>"|14065.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14065-machines-that-listen/|6.8|Zach Kelly

Though only single ""Jail La La"" (the would-be LP's title) deals with actually being imprisoned, it's an oddly appropriate fit for the Dum Dum Girls' aesthetic: leather, cherry red lipstick, a classic girl-group sound that nods to drag races as much as malt shops. Because of an image licensing snafu, the original concept was scrapped, and in its stead is <i>I Will Be</i>, a blistering half-hour of menacing, witty bubblegum pop.</p>
<p>Originally, Dum Dum Girls was a one-woman show. Kristin Gundred (stage name Dee Dee) first introduced the project as a bare-bones experiment, taking lo-fi 60s pop and beating it to all hell on DDG's self-titled debut EP. But unlike your average bedroom artist with a four-track and a thing for the Ronettes, Dee Dee was writing songs that were as catchy as they were well-rounded, even when buried under a thick layer of scuzz. (She accomplished the same with the Mayfair Set, an equally scuffed collaboration with Blank Dogs.)</p>
<p><i>I Will Be</i> still retains her EP's grit, but smartly updates the sound, enlisting three new members (including ex-Vivian Girl Frankie Rose) and hiring Richard Gottehrer (co-writer of the eternal ""My Boyfriend's Back"" and producer of records by seminal groups like the Go-Go's and Blondie) to produce alongside Dee Dee. The result is a more accessible version of Dum Dum Girls, bolstered by terrific harmonies (three of the four girls contribute vocals) and a crisper rhythm section. Most notable of all is the production: No longer a lo-fi group, DDG are now a rock band, and an occasionally ferocious one at that. Gottehrer and Dee Dee are perfect foils: She protects the song's fuzzy edges; he enhances the pure pop pleasures with a more textured bite.</p>
<p>All of this technical detail would be lost, however, if it weren't for the fact that these songs are genuine earworms, both unfailingly hip and often wonderfully associative. Most adhere to a deep romanticism that details the various incarnations of love, from the fatalistic (""Yours Alone"", featuring guitar work from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner) to the overprotective (""Everybody's Out""). There is an air of disaffection that peppers a lot of these songs (for example, ""Oh Mein M"" is sung entirely in German), but they never end up feeling too cool for school, with their giddy bounce often fostering a more inclusive feel than anything else. The quick highs, dissatisfaction, and longing can't hide how terrifically fun most of <i>I Will Be</i> is.</p>
<p>But in the end it's ultimately Dee Dee's show, her voice often deeply mysterious and feminine and other times coy and a little perilous. And as good as she is at anchoring a two-minute burst of rattling exuberance, the closing cut finds Dee Dee doing an ethereal rendition of Sonny and Cher's ""Baby Don't Go"", adding a real sense of fragility that undercuts the exquisite nature of the whole gritty thing. It's a grand little final gift from a record that's absolutely packed with them.</p></div>"|14054.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14054-i-will-be/|8.2|Zach Kelly

And yet, all of those seem less implausible than the second Deadly Syndrome record being received so quietly. This band was<i> on its way </i>three years ago-- galvanizing live shows, fervent local support, and <i>The Ortolan</i>, a record which hit enough populist-indie pleasure points to transcend the notion that they were mere beneficiaries of Silver Lake's hype cycle.</p>
<p>I don't know exactly what happened to the Deadly Syndrome in the time since, but judging from <i>Nolens Volens </i>not much of it was good. The record sounds haunted by missed opportunities, isolation, and spiritual crisis. Solo acoustic opener ""Villain"" announces <i>Nolens Volens </i>as a totally different record than its predecessor-- the carnival instrumentation is dialed way back. You will no longer be hearing Wolf Parade comparisons. More startling are singer Chris Richard's vocals, which sound sapped of all hope, his yelp turned into a confessional plaint almost ashamed of itself before he turns accusatory (""why don't you just go fuck off and die? Is there anything you need?"").</p>
<p>Despite a dangerously sweet piano lead, ""Doesn't Matter"" is no brighter, Richard shrugging through another morning wasted on sleep. ""Party City"" and the ""Paint It, Black""-drone of ""Deer   Trail Place"" conjure drawn blinds and the disappearance of once-familiar faces, but while they're visceral, they're not muscular. Instead, they convey a feeling the record as a whole absolutely nails, the twitchy confusion borne of someone feeling trapped by their own inaction.</p>
<p>As with <i>The Ortolan, Nolens Volens </i>rounds out with a synthetically composed epilogue, but the differences between the two are the most vivid illustration of the Deadly Syndrome's attitude shift.<i> </i>""This Old Home"" was a Casio-heavy lark that conveyed a sense of humor the band mostly evidenced outside of their actual songs. ""Heresy"" is eight minutes of mournful drones and chipping snares. Hell, in the end I don't know if <i>Nolens Volens</i> predicts the band packing it in or hitting a crucial turning point. I'm hoping for the latter-- for all <i>The Ortolan</i>'s pleasures, in retrospect it feels like a record that was going only as far as its ability to draw name-drops. <i>Nolens Volens </i>may be more sonically spare and emotionally despondent, but it's exponentially more honest and direct. This might not be the band's debut, but it feels like the first time we're really hearing what the Deadly Syndrome have to say.</p></div>"|14071.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14071-nolens-volens/|7.7|Ian Cohen

This, his first full-length under the MB guise, was produced by Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock for the latter's Glacial Pace imprint, a footnote that's actually no footnote at all. In addition to simply signing him, Brock has taken Lacy under his wing in recent years, bringing him along to open Modest Mouse amphitheater tours, and leaving behind audible prints on his studio efforts as well.</p>
<p>Lacy's extremely gifted with cyclical melodies: thorny, fingerpicked spines around which he can snake a range of sounds simply for ambience. He accomplishes a lot of that here by considering a lot of the same moods and midnight tones as Brock did on his masterstroke <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i> or his work in Ugly Casanova. The vocal layers in particular are used as backup instruments, garbled and muffled (see the thunderclapping coda of ""New Doomsdays"") as though they're being transmitted from other orbits. Yet on openers ""Home and Somewhere Else"" and the appropriately titled ""The Loop"", it works because of how close it all feels when streaming through headphones. Whether Lacy's whispering or rasping, purring or stretching out his falsetto, you can hear each inhale and exhale as though you're listening from inside the dude's chest cavity. Lyrically he keeps in time and rhyme with the nature of his picking, the effect just as riveting as it is meditative.</p>
<p>But much of the record's success relies on arrangement in lieu of variety. When Lacy introduces more to the fold, be it floating piano (""10 Percent"") or strings (""Cabin Fever"") or light horns (""Under and in Rocks""), the results are gorgeous. On the other end of the spectrum, ""Them"" falls totally flat without a tooth or hook to be found. It's actually a tough, restrictive way to operate as a songwriter, and when he breaks out, he's at his very best. Bookended by elliptical guitars, ""Burning Stars"" inverts his songwriting steez and blooms into a more traditional pop strummer. It's got great velocity, an achy-breaky melody, a terrific solo and even a few choruses and verses, too. It also doesn't sound like anyone but him.</p></div>"|14084.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14084-mimicking-birds/|7.4|David Bevan

Scott Morgan is one of those guys. Unlike Tim Hecker or Pantha du Prince, who draw from more intricate arrangements, Morgan lays his sounds bare and lets them go right to work. Recording as Loscil since the early 2000s, he's built an impressive catalogue of pensive, minimal records that turn computerized sounds into something strangely soothing-- the kind of music you want to listen to flat on your back, eyes fixed at the ceiling. While each of his records is at least good, it started to feel by 2006's <i>Plume</i> like Morgan had reached a creative plateau.</p>
<p>His latest effort, <i>Endless Falls</i>, breathes some new life into the Loscil project. Not so much a departure but a natural progression of what he cooked up with early albums <i>Triple Point</i> and <i>Submers</i>, the record is again a concept piece. At its most basic, the idea here is that <i>Endless Falls</i> is a rainy-day album, overcast but cozy, and there's an aquatic theme that extends to its cover art and the rain-droplet field recordings that bookend the record. Morgan plays with the idea of water-as-sound throughout and pulls it off in appealing ways. ""Shallow Water Blackout"" is kind of liquid headphone music that swooshes from ear to ear, and the very good ""Dub for Cascadia"" is, as you might expect, an exercise in deeply submerged, underwater dub.</p>
<p>Sometimes conceptual ambient albums can feel a bit forced-- Klimek's recent film-centric <i>Movies Is Magic</i> comes to mind-- but here the theme works hand-in-hand with the music. Morgan breaks with the concept for the final track, though, for one of the album's most interesting moments. ""The Making of Grief Point"" is a spoken-word piece featuring Destroyer's Dan Bejar (Morgan also plays drums in that band) about the struggles of the creative process. Bejar's voice comes as a shock after 50 some-odd minutes of gentle atmospherics, and he speaks about feeling conflicted and confused about making art. ""I have lost interest in music"", he says. ""It is horrible."" It's very a strange way to close out an album like this, but confident, I think, to punctuate it so forcefully. You're at ease for a time and then yanked back into the real world-- don't all good records end like that?</p></div>"|14077.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14077-endless-falls/|7.5|Joe Colly

Evoking the feral angst of button-pushers like the Blood Brothers and more notably proggy acts like At the Drive-In and Coheed and Cambria, Native don't move too far in either direction. So <i>Wrestling Moves</i>, their debut LP, is gussied up to sound more epic than it actually is. While it occasionally hits a stride with an invigorating surge of punked-up thrash, more often the album is it nullified with arbitrary transitions and tempo shifts that leave Native with too much space and little to fill it with.</p>
<p>It's pointless to talk about individual tracks here, since there is so little distinction between them. While the approach may have meant to create a uniform sound for the record, there's a difference between trying to establish a thread and making it nearly impossible to tell one cut from the other. Each squall of anxiety-ridden, teenage disquietude as embodied in lead singer's Bobby Markos' shredded screech is always followed with a tempo change that leaves the song feeling sprawled-out and motionless, colored only by a limp toss of a few pallid guitar melodies into the mix. Instead of building and releasing structures or employing a memorable hook, the band simply moves back and forth between these two points for the entirety of the album. A few cuts apply some interesting ambient guitar interplay, but there's very little divergence throughout.</p>
<p>Native show some potential. These Arms Are Snakes drummer Chris Common nicely handles production duties, and wisely anchors most of the material around drummer Nick Glassen, who sometimes is able to save otherwise bland retreads with terse syncopations. But <i>Wrestling Moves</i> winds up feeling inert, suggesting that Native might have only one move after all.</p></div>"|14047.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14047-wrestling-moves/|3.7|Zach Kelly

It's not that there isn't plenty of good music in this vein being made. It's that one band, 20 years ago, did this sound so well and with so much personality, they set a difficult standard for newcomers to meet.</p>
<p>Galaxie 500 didn't last long. They formed in Boston in 1986, released three albums between 1988 and 1990, got great notices in the press (especially the UK), and then dissolved. Following their breakup, after which lead singer and guitarist Dean Wareham went on to Luna and the rhythm section of Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang formed Magic Hour and Damon and Naomi, Galaxie 500 albums went out of print. Krukowski bought the master tapes in an auction, the albums were gathered with bonus material in a box set by Rykodisc in 1996 and then reissued separately. They fell out of print again.</p>
<p>Damon and Naomi's label, 20/20/20, are now bringing them out again in expanded 2xCD form, along with newly mastered vinyl editions. The CD packages are more functional than revelatory. The three original LPs have been smartly paired with extra discs that gather all extant material: 1988 debut <i>Today </i>with the covers/demos/B-sides set <i>Uncollected</i>; 1989's <i>On Fire</i> with Peel Sessions; and 1990's <i>This Is Our Music</i> with the live album <i>Copenhagen</i>. The liner notes by Byron Coley originally included in the latter are included with all three packages. There's no new information or previously unheard stuff  in these sets,  but there is a lot of remarkable music.</p>
<p><i>Today </i>might be the best song-by-song album of Galaxie 500's three. It's also the most varied, moving from the ghostly mid-tempo beauty of opener ""Flowers"", the dreamiest dream-pop song of them all, to the deeply affecting absurdity of ""Tugboat"", where the narrator wants to leave the world behind and ""be your tugboat captain,"" to the pounding, mantra-like cover of Jonathan Richman's ""Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste"", which actually rocks. Wareham's voice stays in a cracked upper register that can either be yearning or transcendent, and his guitar sustain seems to go on for days. Yang's bass playing, like that of Peter Hook, from whom she borrowed heavily, is the band's emotional center, and Krukowski's drums are as much about texture as they are about time-keeping. There were no virtuosos in this group, but everyone's part was essential. Rare is the band where three voices this distinctive come together to make a fourth, equally distinctive thing that transcends everything that went into it. And even more rare is the debut this assured and complete.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>Today </i>was such a terrific first statement, the only way for Galaxie 500 to best it was to narrow their focus and concentrate on doing one thing perfectly. Everything about 1989's <i>On Fire</i>, from the iconic cover art (the sleeve, like all three of their records, was designed by Yang) to producer Kramer's brilliantly surreal liner notes, to the just-under-mid-tempo beat that drives every song, comes together to support the whole. Wareham's guitar in particular remains fixated on one primitive strumming pattern, and the first three songs all find him taking off onto soaring wordless choruses in a falsetto-drenched reverb. Krukowski uses his drums to superb effect throughout, reinforcing the narcotic pace of the music with his slow-mo percussive explosions. It sounds samey in a sense, but <i>On Fire</i>'s narrow focus turns out to be a strength. It feels immersive, the rock album as ambient record, and it's the definitive slowcore statement.</p>
<p>On this reissue, as with the prior Rykodisc set, the original album is augmented with three additional songs originally on the <i>Blue Thunder </i>EP, including a take on Joy Division's ""Ceremony"" that could be the best cover of the legendary band in existence. And the Peel Sessions set, collecting two four-song sessions, is nothing short of essential. Galaxie 500's versions of their own work are just as strong but different, and the covers of the Sex Pistols, Young Marble Giants, and Buffy St. Marie, show how they could absorb the songs of others into their aesthetic.</p>
<p><i>This Is Our Music</i>, from 1990, has a few of Galaxie 500's best tunes and it also has the richest production, with greater focus on keyboards and layered guitars. ""Fourth of July"" is funny, ""Summertime"" has an almost blinding sparkle, and Yang's vocal on the cover of Yoko Ono's ""Listen, the Snow Is Falling"" is a pretty good argument that she should be fronting her own project. But despite its high points, <i>This Is Our Music</i> also has a few duds, which are the only easy skips on the band's proper records. ""Way Up High"" and ""Hearing Voices"" are nice enough, but feel like Galaxie 500 on cruise control. Hard to say where they might've gone from here.</p>
<p>Given the relative merits of <i>This Is Our Music</i>, a fine album that sometimes sounds sleepy instead of dreamy, the fact that Galaxie 500 called it quits in spring 1991 is no tragedy. Some bands are meant to last for three albums; this was one of them. All involved would go on to do good things, including Kramer, who carried his sonic innovations into Low's early work. The live album, <i>Copenhagen</i>, which is heavy on songs from <i>This Is Our Music</i> and in almost every case improves upon them, turns out to be the ideal closing chapter. During the 1990 show in Denmark, Galaxie 500 play magnificently to what sounds like a pretty small crowd. But that small crowd is <i>into it</i>. Sometimes bands work like that. They never made it big, but during their short run, Galaxie 500's often quiet and always beautifully rendered music had a profound impact on a few people, including this writer.

They cull their sound from time-honored sources on their debut, <i>Tomorrow is Alright</i>, yet they're a wonderful anomaly-- never feeling tied to any particular era, overly beholden to their source material, or like they chose reverence for lack of better ideas. You can throw out influences all day-- Everly Brothers, glammy garage, doo-wop-- but you'll never quite cover it, and this slipperiness is key to their success. <i>Tomorrow Is Alright</i> matches 10 of Sonny Smith's wry, easygoing tunes with a far-reaching pastiche of vintage trappings, never feeling dutifully retro but rather, like their tough-to-pin-down citymates Girls, intangibly classic.</p>
<p>Smith's been kicking around San Francisco for a minute now as both a playwrite and songsmith. The former's written all over <i>Tomorrow</i>'s best tunes, which paint slightly askew, slyly funny portraits of wayward spacemen and the women who enslave them, randy youngsters, and Mary Kay test subjects. Throughout the record, Smith himself seems to be playing this unflappable bemused observer character. Smith's bent sense of humor and his sweet, scraggly pipes further sets them apart from their obvious sonic forebears. In no particular hurry to get to his point, Smith comes off as a likeable dude, and that easy charm helps put even the more directly descended songs over. No matter how you dressed these tunes up, they'd still feel cool, confident, and at times, wickedly funny.</p>
<p>The Sunsets, featuring members of Thee Oh Sees, the Fresh &amp; Onlys, and Citay, plus Sub Pop's Kelley Stoltz largely stay in the background, providing sparse but carefully considered instrumentation. Citay's Tahlia Harbour is the lone exception, although even she's used sparingly; her deadpan counterpoints to Sonny's stoney spaceman in ""Planet of Women"" or rationale-spouting youngster in ""Lovin' on an Older Gal"" are impeccably timed, a fitting gee-whiz to Sonny's endless aw-shucks. The production's crisp and roomy, allowing each word to linger, each note its own space.</p>
<p><i>Tomorrow Is Alright</i> feels like the work of a songwriter comfortable with himself and his limitations. Smith doesn't have a knockout voice; he's a natural, unflashy guitarist; and his lyrics skew conversational rather than confessional. Rather than outpacing himself with wild ambitions, <i>Tomorrow Is Alright</i> picks a lane and sticks with it, yet it feels far less reductive than most retro rock due to his easy charm. The couple-three tunes towards the back of <i>Tomorrow</i> that lean just a tad more heavily on older tropes don't leave quite the same mark as the very distinctive early highlights ""Planet"" or ""Too Young to Burn"" or ""Death Cream"", but even those throw an earworm or sweet harmony your way. So many bands put in a lot of work trying to make themselves sound older than their years; with their quiet confidence and no shortage of killer material, the Sunsets make it seem almost too easy.</p></div>"|14069.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14069-tomorrow-is-alright/|8.0|Paul Thompson

Their songs have a remarkable sense of atmosphere and romanticism. They nod at their heroes-- maybe Stereolab and Björk, maybe Cocteau Twins or 1980s pop-- without overtly stealing. They seem to know they are capable of great things; perhaps ostentatiously, they <a href=""http://vimeo.com/8685376"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">released a trailer</a> for <i>Color Your Life</i>, just their second EP (following November 2008's brief but occasionally stunning <i>Vampires With Dreaming Kids)</i>. The EP features six songs, one of which is the instrumental ""Galaxy Plateau"", a stormy, harmonium-lead bit of futzing that is completely inessential. Even then, it's handled with such grace, it never feels presumptuous. Almost earned.</p>
<p>Twin Sister's singer, the mousily enchanting Andrea Estella, has the sort of breathy, committed voice that untangles knots. It sits all over the mix on <i>Color Your Life</i>, a significant, if not monumental leap forward for the band. Sometimes Estella is high up, as on ""Milk &amp; Honey"", a wrenching ballad about what so many of their songs are about: the promise of love and the confusing moments at the beginning and end of every relationship. It's a gorgeous song that quakes and quivers before abruptly ending. The respite is brief before they sharply enter the best thing they have done to date. ""All Around and Away We Go"" is a magical thing, driving and relaxed at once. Pitchfork's Ryan Schreiber recently compared the song to Andrea True Connection's disco chestnut ""More, More, More"", and despite the seeming incongruity, that's right on. Twin Sister thrive when things are hushed, as on <i>Vampires</i>' arresting ""I Want a House"" but they seem unhappy with those simple moves. ""All Around"" takes them to a new and better place.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Color Your Life</i> weaves in and out with little urgency. ""Lady Daydream"" is similarly lush, and full of heartfelt declarations-- ""If you can't find the sea, I will take you there,"" Estella sings on the chorus. Seven-minute opener ""The Other Side of Your Face"" seems to be the unfinished cousin of ""All Around and Away We Go""-- it never quite leaves the launching pad. Closer ""Phenomenons"" is polished and, strangely, almost radio-ready if it had an actual chorus. But that's not who this band is, either.

With township music to the south; Afrobeat, highlife, and juju going on Northwest; and soukous thriving just over the northern border, there's something bluntly Western about some of the music that came out of cities like Kitwe or Lusaka mid-decade. But then, considering the European post-colonial influence that still ran through the country at the time, Zam-rock's fuzzed-out, psych/proto-metal bent shouldn't be that surprising. Neither should the fact that so little of it actually came to the surface until recently; if a dedicated ethnomusicologist is going to take a trip to central Africa, it's probably not to bring back albums that sound like Blue Cheer's <i>Vincebus Eruptum</i>.</p>
<p>Which brings us to a more interesting facet about Zam-rock besides how out of place it initially seems: how out of time it actually sounds. <i>Africa</i>, the sole album by Kitwe five-piece Amanaz, is one of the better examples of the genre's style, and how it was both behind and ahead of its era. It was released in 1975, rock's weird no-man's-land period between glam and punk, but its buzzing riffs and noodly solos place it a bit closer to 1969. That said, it's hard to pinpoint their exact influences, and the ones that come to mind at first listen seem like some kind of projection: if few people in the States or Europe bought albums by the Stooges or the Velvet Underground when they first came out, what's the likelihood that they made it to a Zambian audience even five years later? Yet you get a Ron Asheton wah-wah snarl in ""Making the Scene"", and there's a pretty Sterling Morrison-style lead guitar on ""Sunday Morning""-- which, besides sharing a title with a popular Velvets song, also sounds eerily like ""Oh! Sweet Nuthin'"".</p>
<p>But it could all just be the shared byproduct of recording straightforward, low-budget rock in an economically depressed environment. For all their cursory musical similarities with the same bands that inspired punk rock, Amanaz were fairly unassuming, even through all the fuzztone. Unassuming in this case doesn't necessarily mean unambitious-- on record, they sound like a band that wanted to ply their trade in heavy rock, folk-pop, and funk all at once-- but there's a rawness on this album that gives it a familiar garage-band appeal. Rhythms shift from minimalist plod-stomps one track to supple grooves the next; lead singer Keith Kabwe's voice sometimes stretches past his melodic range into an off-key flatness that would be more off-putting if it didn't sound so spontaneous, and it's all recorded with a muddy fidelity that, if reminiscent of bedroom tape culture, doesn't do the music any favors by turning what could've been a wall of guitar squall into a flimsy chain-link fence.</p>
<p>Not like much of that can be helped or even really matters, since <i>Africa</i> is one of those albums we should at least consider ourselves lucky to even get a chance to hear. Kabwe had retired to a life of farming by the time this album was proposed for reissue, and out of the other four band members, only guitarist Isaac Mpofu still survives. So hearing Kabwe wail, ""Lemme tell you something new/ About the history of the man/ He's got nothing to lose,"" in ""History of Man"" resonates a bit more knowing just how little was saved from the Zam-rock scene for future posterity and how close to impermanence Amanaz's music actually came.</p></div>"|14050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14050-africa/|7.0|Nate Patrin

<p>Don't be dissuaded by other, more infamous ""White""-themed guitar-and-drums duos: Alex White still has swagger for miles as a guitarist and vocalist. To compare younger brother Francis to his counterpart from the aforementioned White Stripes, he's a more accomplished player but less present as a personality. As the band's rhythmic anchor, he's nearly as unbuttoned as Alex with his instrument, and uses tracks like ""Overwhelmed"" to play drum fills that last for the entire songs. When he contributes a vocal, even if it's just to egg the elder White on, it makes a difference, whether adding backing vocals to the concise and melodic opener ""White Widow"" or a counterpart to the slower and sassier ""Don't Hold My Hand"".</p>
<p><i>White Mystery</i> is almost too long; what could have been eight to 10 single-release-worthy tracks is 14 almost exhausting ones. The same basic elements can be fatiguing, and can feel more like jamming the same button on the jukebox 14 times than a cohesive record with peaks and valleys. But even more than bratty lyrics, posessed vocals, or perpetual swagger, these songs beam with a sincere, almost perverse feeling of pride. The live-in-the-room-feeling, warts-and-all production makes obvious sense for a garage-rock duo, though it belies some of the sweetness at the core of some of their most immediate songs-- the ode to bipedalism ""Take a Walk"" or the PG-rated flirt of ""Don't Hold My Hand"". The lyrics of ""Respect Yourself"", bordering on pull quotes from an inspirational after-school special, are delivered so earnestly that they demand to be taken at face value. Irony, just like subtlety, holds very little import on White Mystery's debut.</p></div>"|14043.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14043-white-mystery/|7.2|Jason Crock

It emerged in the aftermath of his stabbing death the year before, during which the shock over his gruesome death was compounded by troubling revelations. We were hearing about spiraling drug problems, ambiguities in his autopsy, and his fraught relationship with his family. For Smith's hardcore fans, the album's very existence was charged. Smith's family had assumed the task of completing the record and several contentious artistic decisions were made, including bringing in longtime producer Rob Schnapf and Joanna Bolme to finish a number of Elliott's songs that had been recorded as demos. At the time, the final result felt too hot to touch, and it remains the uneasy outlier in Smith's discography to this day.</p>
<p>It was a sad fate for what had been shaping up to be the most sprawling, ambitious record of Smith's career. Whatever troubles may have been plaguing his personal life at the time, Smith seemed thrilled at the direction his music was taking.  In interviews, he exulted in having discovered a ""big"" sound that made sense for him-- one that squared his expanding ambitions with his demand for pin-drop intimacy. His previous record, <i>Figure 8</i>, coated his songs in a blinding sheen that suited him as poorly as the rumpled all-white tux he'd worn to the Oscars. <i>Basement</i> saw him recoiling from that polish without abandoning his dream of a bigger sound, and whatever else it might be, it's the most complete document we have of the music he was hearing in his head those final years.</p>
<p>The opening of ""Coast to Coast"" immediately gives us an idea of the changes Smith had in mind. After 40 seconds of haunted carnival music, a brambled wall of guitars presses in from all sides, with Smith's wounded tenor emanating weakly from the center. Everything  feels uncomfortably, purposefully <i>too-close</i>; with mics pressed up against the instruments, every twitch and scrape is crystalized. The mix is startlingly vivid: When the first guitar is strummed on ""Pretty (Ugly Before)"", the chord doesn't ring so much as bloom, suffusing the song with soft light. ""Strung Out Again"" is a lurching waltz, with Smith's guitar lines creaking and stumbling into wrong notes. Elliott's voice, in this context, has never sounded lovelier or more ruined.  No beautiful sound escapes without scars.</p>
<p>Smith wrote with painful economy and eloquence about his own shortcomings, and his words cleaved through bullshit with bracing force. During the <i>Basement on the Hill</i> sessions, he began writing about his drug problems and depression with an unprecedented clarity. It seemed like an implicit rise to the challenge he posed himself in ""Strung Out Again"", where ""Just looking in the mirror/ Will make you a brave man."" He sings calmly and directly about terrifying scenarios. After years of rehabilitation and relapse, he had boiled the exhausting cycle of lifelong addiction down to eleven brutal words: ""Took a long time to stand/ Took an hour to fall.""</p>
<p>The context is part of the reason listening to <i>From a Basement on the Hill</i> felt somewhat indecent in 2004. Now, Kill Rock Stars is re-releasing the album alongside a remastered reissue of his 1994 debut, <i>Roman Candle</i>, situating the two records as bookends to an extraordinarily fertile career that may even help the volatile <i>Basement on the Hill</i> settle in more comfortably alongside the rest of Elliott's work.</p>
<p><i>Roman Candle</i>, for its part, remains a fan favorite, and it contains some classic Smith songs: ""Condor Ave"", the title track, and ""Last Call"", in particular. And yet it mostly serves to point to all that Elliott would later become. It's wispier and more diffuse than his self-titled or <i>Either/Or</i>, and nothing here is as indelible as ""Needle in the Hay"", ""The Biggest Lie"" or ""Ballad of Big Nothing"". A few of the ""No Name"" song sketches drift in and out without leaving much of a mark-- Smith's music would become fuller, and his harmonic language more confident, on subsequent albums.  The sound is there, though, unmistakable from the first note: the defeated whisper of the vocals, the deceptively intricate guitar work, and the angry little mantras (""leave alone, leave alone, 'cause you know you don't belong here"").  From these beginnings, Smith would experiment with how much he could add to this framework without crushing it; on <i>From a Basement on the Hill</i>, he found a thrilling new plateau. Sadly, we can now only imagine where he would have gone from here.</p></div>"|14070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14070-roman-candle-from-a-basement-on-the-hill/|7.8|Jayson Greene

As an arranger, he devised backing tracks for many of the country's popular singers, and as a solo artist he forged an unorthodox path of his own, developing a unique Ethio jazz style. It had at its core fundamental Ethiopian musical concepts, the pentatonic scale first and foremost. But Astatke, the only vibraphonist on the Addis scene, mixed these sounds with the jazz, Latin music, and psychedelia he'd picked up during his time at music schools in the U.S. and Britain to make something new.</p>
<p>As important as he was to Ethiopian pop's golden era, Astatke's solo recordings were never commercial successes, and they remained little-heard outside his home country until Buda Musique's Ethiopiques series devoted its fourth volume to him in 1998. The cover showed him with Duke Ellington during the latter's 1973 visit to Addis, which was apt-- his own music had an Ellingtonian richness and sense of texture. Since that release, interest in his music has steadily grown. In the last few years, Astake got himself back in the game, heading to Harvard University on a Radcliffe Institute fellowship, where he worked on an opera and a modernization of the krar, a traditional Ethiopian stringed instrument. Last year, he cut an album and toured with London's Heliocentrics, and on <i>Mulatu Steps Ahead</i>, he works with them again, as well as Boston's Either/Orchestra, to take his music to a few places it's never been before.</p>
<p>For one thing, much of Astatke's past music, especially his classic stuff, was much more structured and stately than what he does here. It's as though he's come out of his Ellington period and he's moving into a looser, more improvisational realm. The band eases into the album with ambient opener ""Radcliffe"", guys in a room gathering steam together, and the sound coalesces on ""Green Africa"". By the time they get into ""The Way to Nice"", they're hammering out a swinging groove.</p>
<p>The way the saxes wind through pentatonic themes in unison on ""Mulatu's Mood"" recalls classic Astatke, and they give a solo to the bass sax and another to a kora, a West African harp that Mulatu drags across the continent and seamlessly inserts into his own music. He reaches way back into his own catalog on ""I Faram Gami I Faram"", a tune he originally wrote and recorded in New York in 1966. The combination of Ethio jazz texture, Latin rhythm, melismatic Ethiopian lead singing and salsa backing vocals is amazingly natural, and it's a much more distinctive version than the original, which features a more typical boogaloo vocal.</p>
<p>It's great to hear Mulatu himself stretching out, soloing on ""Ethio Blues"" and creatively filling out the chords elsewhere. Anyone who's liked his music in the past is very likely to enjoy this, but I think <i>Mulatu Steps Ahead</i> will broaden Astatke's jazz following as well, and frankly, it's a much more coherent record than a lot of heavily improvisational modern jazz albums. It's a very easy album to access for listeners who aren't particularly schooled in either jazz or the Ethiopiques series as well, moving an old, appealing sound forward and outward. It's a pleasure to hear a man of Mulatu's age and past accomplishments push himself artistically like this, and it will be interesting to see where his music goes next.</p></div>"|14023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14023-mulatu-steps-ahead/|8.3|Joe Tangari

Among the notables left behind is singer, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Jim Putnam, who arguably has always been the band's central figure. Ironically, getting whittled down to one primary member probably makes it easier to stretch out the lifespan of a band, and Putnam soon rechristened the group Radar Brothers and recruited a new rhythm section (bass player Be Hussey and drummer Stevie Treichel) to record <i>The Illustrated Garden</i>. Just as the band's name is only slightly different, the new lineup's sound is only slightly different as well, yet the impact of the changes is still felt. It could be just be a trick of the light, but Putnam's songs here seem a little less elliptical than usual, the music more focused in its gauzy exploration of what could be loosely called Americana.</p>
<p>The ""Americana"" tag sticks thanks to the general country-rock tropes and all the natural imagery, but as usual the group excels at blurring the edges of an already blurry genre with spacey (but never indulgent) psych leanings, controls set for the heart of the sun but anchored comfortably down to earth. Songs such as ""Quarry"", ""Radio"", and ""For the Birds"" recall such fellow travelers as the Meat Puppets at their most desert-fried, but Putnam's gentle vocals and the generally blissed-out disposition of the new lineup highlight the band's allegiance to craft over sun-bathed affectation.</p>
<p>Indeed, when all else fails, <i>The Illustrated Garden</i> sure sounds great, with ""Horses Warriors"", ""And the Birds"", ""Xmas Lights"", and ""People"" all echoing the settled, mellow spirit of the early 1970s. Each track glows like a golden hour snapshot capturing a certain sunset idealism (occasional flashes of menace in the lyrics aside), and if Putnam surely harbors no illusions at this point of his music's reach, that doesn't mean his songs shine any less brightly.</p></div>"|14066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14066-the-illustrated-garden/|7.0|Joshua Klein

In from the horizon sweeps a black cloud, kicked up by an army of similar-looking rodents. That's the basic set-up of <i>Varmints</i>, a 24-minute film by Studio AKA animator Marc Craste, based on a book written by Helen Ward and illustrated by Craste. Jóhann Jóhannsson draws the title of his latest album from the book, and this is the music he composed for the film's soundtrack. There's quite a bit of extra material-- the album is a full 15 minutes longer than the film-- but there's really no padding.<i> And in the Endless Pause There Came the Sound of Bees</i> works as a suite and doesn't require knowledge of the film or even the film's existence to work as a recording, though I recommend seeing the movie if you get the chance, as it's a very well-done eco-parable.</p>
<p>As a recording, the album displays a few sides of Jóhannsson we haven't heard before. Among his albums to date, it's one of the most musically active, and befitting its origin, also the most soundtrack-y, which means something for a guy working in a genre frequently referred to as cinematic. We first got to know the Icelandic composer through two brilliant minimal electro-orchestral albums, <i>Englabörn</i> and <i>Virðulegu forsetar</i>, both of which displayed a knack for unifying the whole work by exploring and re-exploring the same themes in different contexts. <i>And in the Endless Pause</i> does the same, returning to a series of motifs and using the orchestration to imply different meanings each time. Though it does incorporate some of Jóhannsson's trademark electronic treatments, this is largely an orchestral and choral work, given a vividly atmospheric, almost spectral performance by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.</p>
<p>One of the biggest surprises of the score is how openly dramatic it is given the composer's past work. The solo cello that moans up out of the droning morass of ""Escape"" before being swallowed by a hideous electro-acoustic groan is among the most nakedly emotional sounds I've heard in his music. The richness of the arrangements elsewhere gives them dramatic heft-- ""Rainwater"" is so thick with strings it feels as if it could burst (it scores an odd scene in which huge flying jellyfish sprinkle dandelion seeds over the city). It has the glacial beauty of a lot of his past work without the glacial pacing. Which is not to say it's better, as the slow pacing of <i>Virðulegu forsetar</i> was one of its assets, but it is more immediate, whether or not you're watching those civilization-building rodents.</p></div>"|14064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14064-and-in-the-endless-pause-there-came-the-sound-of-bees/|7.3|Joe Tangari

Like the other Tee Pee Records band in which Mascis is involved (sludge merchants Witch), his role here is strictly supporting. Sweet Apple's main man is instead John Petkovic, a Cleveland-area musician with his own three-decade career, in two respected yet unheralded bands (Death of Samantha and Cobra Verde).</p>
<p>After the passing of his mother, Petkovic drove from Cleveland to Vermont to visit Mascis and bassist Dave Sweetapple, which lead to him writing the 70s arena rock-like songs that would end up on <i>Love &amp; Desperation</i>.  There's a cathartic who-gives-a-shit vibe to the entire enterprise, which is great when Sweet Apple stumble upon something worth giving a shit about.  A few songs (the glammed-up barnburner ""Hold Me, I'm Dying""; grungy behemoth ""Never Came"") manage to successfully turn that trick.  A Casio-abetted ballad like ""Dead Moon"" falls a little short of that mark, but it's a welcome digression.  On much of the album, Petkovic unfortunately goes against his strengths as a songwriter, trying to strike a irony-free bad-to-the-bone rock-god pose that neither his voice nor words can back up.</p>
<p>He comes up with a few killer lines-- ""I wasn't born, I was detached""-- and doesn't come up short as a singer for lack of trying (though his howling on ""It's Over Now"" comes close).  However, all the not-so-tough talk about vampires and dead bodies and bad-ass chicks loses its luster after the third or fourth go-around.  Coupling these clichés with sky-high guitar heroics doesn't help matters (though the faux-epic ""Blindfold"" manages to sidestep that pothole with a truly epic guitar solo).  At their best, Sweet Apple sound like they're trying to emulate the lovable-loserdom perfected by one of Petkovic's unsung Cleveland rock peers, Prisonshake.  At their worst, such as ""Goodnight"", Petkovic goes on and on about him and his hard-luck honey while the group tediously grinds away in the background.  It's a sour note to hit, especially on such a haphazard journey.  From the sounds of things (both in the press materials, and, intermittently, in some of the songs), the journey that lead Petkovic to make this album was one he needed to take.  Here's hoping that whatever road lead Petkovic to <i>Love &amp; Desperation</i> ultimately gets him back to doing what he does best.</p></div>"|14067.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14067-love-desperation/|5.1|David Raposa

Jack starts to play the piano and sing his ballad ""White Moon"". Meg starts to cry. It's a heartbreaking, out-of-nowhere surge of intimacy that briefly lifts the curtain on one of the most fascinatingly private bands to ever reach arena-rock ubiquity. It's also one of those revealing moments that raises more questions than it answers. Are the tears a harbinger of the crippling anxiety that struck Meg soon after the film was shot in 2007, forcing the Stripes to cancel dates and enter a mysterious hiatus that continues to this day? Is Meg acknowledging a hidden truth behind her ex-husband/little brother/good friend's song? Maybe she just didn't get enough sleep the night before. We don't know.</p>
<p>It's this sense of unknowing that makes the White Stripes such a riveting live act. The exquisitely packaged  <i>Under Great White Northern Lights</i> box set aims to summarize the duo in their most potent form-- onstage, with two spotlights beaming straight through them, using little more than eye contact and reflexes to figure out where to go next. And it's a wild success. In a 2002 <i>Spin</i> interview, Meg summed up her musical goals succinctly: ""The point is being a live band."" This comprehensively indulgent live set drives that point home with force.</p>
<p>The box's centerpiece is the <i>UGWNL </i>film directed by Emmett Malloy, which follows Jack and Meg as they hit small Canadian towns with names like Yellowknife and Whitehorse while making their way through every province and territory in the country. The pair also celebrate their 10th anniversary near the end of the trek, lending the affair some sentimental heft; the strange trip from being a couple of married oddballs in peppermint duds to being divorced, canonized Saviors of Rock can sometimes be seen flickering across their faces.</p>
<p>In order to recapture their early days playing for a handful of doubters at Detroit's Gold Dollar, the Stripes scheduled a slew of impromptu, word-of-mouth ""B-side"" shows along the way at a bowling alley, a flour mill, on a bus, and at a cafe in the Northwest Territories. The weirdest and most unorthodox gig goes down at an old-folks home in the sparsely populated city of Iqaluit. The resident elders treat their dark-haired guests to avian myths (""ravens used to speak like us... they are smarter than us"") and raw caribou-- the meeting is warm, out of time, and charmingly absurd. Kind of like a White Stripes song.</p>
<p>Those searching for behind-the-scenes dirt on the band would be better served by an exploitative, unauthorized biography. <i>UGWNL </i>is ultimately a hagiography meant to bolster the White Stripes' status as porcelain, godlike geniuses. And Jack and Meg indeed look impeccable while simply walking across frozen tundra or posing in front of customized red, white, and black tour planes. (Some 200 pages worth of their shutter-ready mugs grace a gorgeous book by ace photog Autumn de Wilde that's included in the box.) No matter where they are or what they're doing, it's tough taking your eyes off these two.</p>
<p>The pair almost comically play into type in the few non-performance candid scenes, often shot during post-show comedowns. Jack is loud and intense; Meg's first words are spoken a full 23 minutes into the film-- and they're so soft they require subtitles. The movie's most contentious exchange is pretty mild, and actually revolves around Meg's refusal (or perhaps inability) to speak up. Throughout, the White Stripes live up to their mythic roles: Jack runs around, charismatically blabbing, yelping, and flailing like a little brother while Meg's big-sis stoicism keeps things grounded. Unlike the similarly formatted 1967 Bob Dylan pic <i>Don't Look Back</i>, which featured the young singer interacting with outsiders and sometimes coming off like a jerk, <i>UGWNL</i> rarely lets us see the Stripes outside of their carefully controlled realm. Even so, moments like Meg's minor breakdown poke through. And more than enough personality comes across in their manic live shows anyway.</p>
<p>The <i>UGWNL </i>movie neatly packs concert highlights into quick-moving medleys. But to explain this band's appeal onstage, the uncut White Stripes live experience is a must. For that, the box offers a manageable 16-track, hit-filled album on both CD and double vinyl and a more hardcore 135-minute DVD of the Stripes' 10th anniversary show in full called <i>Under Nova Scotian Lights</i> and filmed at Glace Bay's Savoy Theater on July 14, 2007. The album sounds ridiculously heavy, with many songs-- including the gurgling ""I'm Slowly Turning Into You"" and the Dusty Springfield cover ""I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself""-- easily trumping their studio counterparts. But the LP is also relatively linear and song-based, which isn't really how White Stripes shows work.</p>
<p>On the flip, the <i>Under Nova Scotian Lights</i> DVD is the best simulacrum of a Stripes live set ever produced. The pair are locked in, switching songs up on the fly, tumbling into old blues covers without pause, and generally proving exactly why they're considered musical superheroes in real time. There's no net for these gigs, and dropped notes or beats happen now and then, but the overall streak of spontaneity is key. In a <i>UGWNL </i>interview segment, Jack talks about how he purposely sets up his instruments far away from each other on the stage as a masochistic motivator to force him to hustle-- he starts sweating through his shirt early on, and doesn't stop. Without a single drum fill or snare roll, Meg once again proves to be the ideal foil for Jack's virtuosity as she fills the room with her crash cymbal while pounding out staunch hard-blues beats John Bonham would appreciate. When Jack sings about ""lookin' for a home"" on traditional closer ""De Ballit of De Boll Weevil"", it's clear he's already found it as he flies feedback through a crowd with Meg to his right. It's exactly where he belongs.</p>
<p>The <i>UGWNL </i>box is also a triumph of Jack's ongoing quest to show the world that ""there is more beauty and romance in tangible, mechanical things than in invisible, digital things."" Though he's ramped up the web presence of his label, Third Man, Jack is still a Luddite at heart, obsessing over outmoded instruments and recording techniques. His aversion to technology can seem stubborn, but a big part of this set's power lies in its physicality. It's blocky and sturdy and aesthetically beautiful in its three-color minimalism. And the seemingly slight bonuses-- a photo-illustration book with Jack as the Tin Man and Meg as Dorothy, a colored 7"" single, a silkscreen print-- add up to give the package a fanclub-style sense of exclusivity (note that the live album and documentary DVD are also being sold separately; the live DVD is exclusive to this box). But its over-the-top grandness as well as its stark black box with red inner-lining also give the set an air of casket-like finality. ""I hope you appreciate what I do for you,"" sings Jack on ""A Martyr for My Love for You"" near the end of the anniversary show. He then steps away from the mic for a good 15 seconds, letting the words float in silence. Then he finishes the song.</p></div>"|14068.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14068-under-great-white-northern-lights-box-set/|8.7|Ryan Dombal

""As soon as I put the headphones on,"" he says, ""the world seemed to be a nicer place."" Nearly 20 years later, after three albums and a slew of remixes, Schnauss still seems engrossed with those lush sounds. Like Sonic Cathedral, the British club night and label that embraces shoegaze in all its permutations, he takes a wide-angle view of the genre, seeing it as a current that runs through many different eras. The solid source material he reworked for the remix collection <i>Missing Deadlines</i>-- which <span style=""font-style: normal;"">ranges from solo work by members of Slowdive and Ride to songs by Rainbirds' frontwoman Katharina Franck and the John Tejada/Takeshi Nishimoto project I'm Not a Gun-- speaks to this sense of related history and possibility.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Taken as a whole, though, Schnauss' treatment of these tracks is aesthetically redundant. Prone to creating ethereal music that sometimes skews toward being too amiable, many of Schnauss' remixes sound like pretty shoegaze setpieces, orchestrated to create a familiar emotional payoff with tricks we've heard many times before. While he pulls some of the songs in a more dance-friendly direction, his bent guitars, clouds of static, and vocal echoes have a way of blending together here.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Take Madrid's ""Out to Sea"", a track built around bright synths, gentle guitar, and breathy vocals. Schnauss' remake bathes it in warm synths and gauzy vocals, softens the guitar, and washes out the sound, placing a halo around the song for emphasis. That dreamy haze also seeps into his treatment of ""Remembrance"", a single by the Joy Division-influenced Dragons that's smoothed over with bent vocals and thick, swirling layers of suspended synths. Mojave 3's epic ""Blurbird of Happiness"" has a warm, rambling vibe that Schnauss over-accents with nature samples and back-masked glockenspiels that sound like wind chimes. Orbital-like echoes are applied to Juanita Stein's vocals on Howling Bells' ""Setting Sun"", maintaining the track's sensual groove, while the rhythm of A Sunny Day In Glasgow's ""Ghost in the Graveyard"" is brought more to the fore until it sounds a bit like M83.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But redundant or not, Schnauss knows how to create sweeping, emotive, grandiose music-- and his remix of Mark Gardner's ""The Story of the Eye"" gets it right by bulking up the track, trading the quiet focus and slow bassline for vocal layers and accordion-like synths. Schnauss always adds a certain signature to his remixes, but it's not always clear if making something busier necessarily makes it better.</p>

Between them, they represent a range of the Bluegrass State's musical traditions: Lexington native Ben Sollee plays cello in a style that borrows from Appalachian techniques, Daniel Martin Moore of Cold Spring is a solo folk artist whose unsolicited demos earned him a slot on Sub Pop's roster, and producer Yim Yames sings in Louisville's famed My Morning Jacket. On their first record together, they play songs about the Kentucky mountains and the plight brought on by the industrial practice called <a href=""http://ilovemountains.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mountaintop removal mining</a>, which is just as invasive and evil as it sounds. <i>Dear Companion</i> examines what it means to be from Kentucky when Kentucky is disappearing-- both literally (entire mountains are being obliterated) and culturally (the geography that shaped its culture and music is being drastically reshaped).</p>
<p>So this is exactly the kind of album you want to succeed, and for the most part, it does. <i>Dear Companion</i> generally avoids the self-importance of most issue-driven music, mainly because Sollee and Moore write songs that rarely stray from their own points of view. Rather than sing about a tractor dismantling a mountain, they focus on their own fears and hopes, especially as they bear on subsequent generations. In addressing these concerns, the songs can be measured and even moving, but occasionally they get a bit lofty. On the aggressively humble ""Only a Song"", with its lyrics about ghettos and Harlem Globetrotters, Sollee and Moore solemnly offer, ""But this is only a song, it can't change the world."" While their voices don't have the rough edges to sell the hardened blues of the title track, their harmonies are loose and casual on opener ""Something, Somewhere, Sometime"" and ""My Wealth Comes to Me"", which breaks into a chorus that sounds like an updated Louvin Brothers.</p>
<p>Fine singers all, Sollee, Moore, and Yames wisely keep the focus primarily on the stringed instruments. Playing guitar and cello almost exclusively, Moore and especially Sollee draw from regional music traditions, but instead of making a folk or bluegrass or country album, they have meshed those styles into a modern sound whose spareness may be its greatest virtue. Sollee's cello adds chilling low end to the coda of ""Sweet Marie"" and creates a high, keening melody on ""It Won't Be Long"", but mostly he plucks and hammers at the strings to create a tectonic rumble, as if trying literally to interpret the sound of mountaintop removal. He and Moore play like they're trying to prove Kentucky's cultures and traditions not only remain relevant at a time when regional distinctions are rapidly disintegrating, but continue to inspire new generations of musicians.</p></div>"|14032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14032-dear-companion/|6.4|Stephen M.

More interestingly, there are very few moments during the last decade-plus that this statement wouldn't be mostly true. The Scottish producer crafts dark, ornate music that seems intentionally at odds with electronic music's current fixation on luminescent house sounds; he has a reputation for minimalism, but his productions seem too roiling to slot into whatever sounds that word represents. Dubstep is similarly deep and ominous, but Smoke sounds steely and focused, not foggy and stoned. On his third album, <i>Lux</i>, he again uses tough arpeggios, mumbled vocals, and furrowed percussion to enact mini-dramas of industrial techno.</p>
<p>Though <i>Lux</i> can evoke comforting sadness, its orchestral bent and general meticulousness keep it from ever feeling truly despairing. So the album offers these small perversions of mood without becoming overbearing. Because he obscures his voice and has a reputation for making complete albums (as opposed to singles), Smoke's work has been compared to Thom Yorke's solo outing, <i>The Eraser</i>. While both share an affinity for the hardscrabble rhythms of mid-1990s IDM, Smoke's compositions are less linear and song-oriented. The 14 tracks on <i>Lux</i> often stretch past six minutes, but Smoke doesn't build to climaxes so much as sniff out every corner of his creations.</p>
<p><i>Lux</i> is Smoke's least motive album yet-- only the most generous definitions of ""dance"" would include this music-- but these tracks don't idle, they prowl. When Smoke increases the tempos-- the thrumming ""Blingkered"", the lite-rave of ""Pilk""-- his songs sound tense, not celebratory. You can connect the lurching ""Physic"" or ""Lux+"" to Hyperdub's smeared sound attacks, but minus the exposed-nerve bass. <i>Lux</i> occasionally sounds like Coil's snake-y masterpiece, <i>Love</i>'<i>s Secret Domain</i>, but that album alluded to sex and drugs (or maybe druggy sex), and Alex Smoke seems chiefly concerned with Alex Smoke.</p>
<p>More than anything, <i>Lux</i> feels self-contained: produced by a single artist and released on Smoke's own Hum + Haw imprint, it projects dark vistas that feel deeply personal. Unlike many techno artists, Smoke builds his albums for sitdown sessions (EPs containing floor-friendly versions of ""Lux+"" and ""Blingkered"" are already available) and has seemingly little concern for where these dense, thoughtful behemoths fit in a broader context. Forunately, <i>Lux</i> needs little besides an accommodating, stormy mindset for its hum and shiver to make sense.</p></div>"|14034.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14034-lux/|7.8|Andrew Gaerig

""Maybe if you listened to LiLiPUT/ Your songs would find more friends."" The Swiss band that called itself first Kleenex, then LiLiPUT, formed in 1978, went through a succession of lineups and three singers, produced a handful of singles and two albums, broke up in 1983, and released a 2xCD of all its extant studio recordings more than a decade later. That collection, called simply <i>LiLiPUT</i>, is a singular post-punk document-- a band inspired by the punk revolution but doing something radically different. You can hear them inventing an idiom from scratch, writing songs that used their rudimentary skills brilliantly, then building on their initial momentum to push themselves further out. It's unlike anything that came before it, and a total blast to listen to. (There may never have been a giddier song recorded than ""Split"".)</p>
<p>Any further recordings, you'd think, would be precious; I've bought more than a couple of dodgy records by other bands because somebody compared them to this one. (A word of advice to anyone thinking of buying, say, the Nixe reissue that came out in 2008: It turns out that being European women who started a band in the post-punk era and didn't have a lot of technical facility at first was not, in fact, what made LiLiPUT special.) So this new 2xCD release sounded mighty promising: a Kleenex set from 1979 and a LiLiPUT set from 1983, plus five previously unreleased songs, and a DVD with half a dozen video clips and <i>Roadmovie</i>, a film of their 1982 tour.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, from the evidence of <i>Live Recordings</i>, LiLiPUT weren't a particularly great live band, and Kleenex were terrible-- shaky, often way out of tune, clinging as tightly as they could to the contours of their recordings and occasionally not even able to manage that. (Somebody bobbles the ending of ""Ain't You"".) The unheard songs are lesser variations on other things they were doing at the time. <i>Roadmovie</i> turns out to be silent, hand-held Super-8 footage of whatever caught the camera-holder's eye on the road, scored with recordings from LiLiPUT's albums; if you've ever wanted to see blurry images of the Swiss autobahn circa 1982, this may hold a smidgen of interest for you.</p>
<p>The video clips are a bit more interesting, especially the 1979 TV appearance in which they wear color-coded outfits and awesome new wave hairstyles, and bassist Klaudia Schiff uncertainly mugs for the camera. But the bottom line is that someone coming to this album without having heard Kleenex/LiLiPUT's studio recordings would have very little idea why one of the greatest bands of their era was anything special. Passionate fans of LiLiPUT still long for anything more that lives up to their legacy. We're going to have to keep waiting.</p></div>"|14056.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14056-live-recordings-tv-clips-roadmovie/|3.3|Douglas Wolk

Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory have  always valued style along with song,  and on most of the fifth Goldfrapp album, <i>Head First</i>, pink  spandex turns out to be a great look. Bringing 1980s  roller-disco synth-pop motifs out of mothballs has given the UK duo their most immediately entertaining album since 2005 electro-glam juggernaut <i>Supernature</i>. The only problem: They fail to give  each song a face as memorable as the overall album's Jane Fonda  workout-video get-up.</p>
<p>Good thing Goldfrapp do spectacle like few else. No less a glamor  lover than Adam Lambert was quoted recently saying he had wanted to work  with the group for his debut, but couldn't because they were already  busy with Christina Aguilera-- not exactly pop's dowdiest persona  herself. Whether in the clown robes and animal masks of Goldfrapp's expert live shows, or the sharp-edged sound design of an eclectic discography, they treat pop as a form of not just communication, but presentation.</p>
<p>With sunny Van Halen synth tones, <i>Xanadu</i>-era Olivia Newton  John optimism, and galloping Giorgio Moroder basslines, <i>Head  First</i> marks as dramatic a shift from 2008's disappointing <i>Seventh  Tree</i> as that album's moodily atmospheric folk did from the fembot  stomp of Goldfrapp's prior two LPs (or those from the John  Barry-soaked trip-hop of 2000 debut <i>Felt Mountain</i>). Alison's  voice is still commanding, gaining a bit of Stevie Nicks  huskiness while staying versatile enough to rise to a glassy peal or  drop to a suggestive purr. So, too, are Gregory's electronics, from the  fist-pumping opening trio of songs to the krautrock seduction and  wordless vocal ambience on the second half.</p>
<p>First single ""Rocket"" shows <i>Head First</i> at its best, but it's  also a reminder of where some of the other songs fall short. When Alison  exhorts, ""I've got a rocket/ You're going on it,"" the potential double  entendre is obvious. This isn't a come-on, though; with suspicions about  ""how she got in the door uninvited"" and a decisive ""you're  never coming back,"" it's a lot closer to a kiss-off. (Although not available on the album, Richard X's powerhouse remix is even better.)</p>
<p>Still, beyond ""Rocket"", few of the songs  here are melodically or lyrically catchy enough to attain anything like  the the popularity of the 80s songs they'll remind you of-- or of Goldfrapp's past  highlights. An exception is  ""Hunt"", which approaches the bedside intimacy of Beach House or White  Hinterland through gorgeously breathy space disco. Another is ""Shiny and Warm"", full of Suicide-seeking synths and icy sensuality. Alas, a nine-song album doesn't leave much room for error.  Goldfrapp remain excellent in the studio-- any future work they do for  Aguilera or anyone else (they also recently scored the soundtrack for John  Lennon biopic <i>Nowhere Boy</i>) deserves watching-- and there's plenty of  highly stylized fun to be had here. Just don't expect to remember many  of the details when it's all over. You might be the best-dressed person at 80s dance night, but if there's nothing particularly noteworthy about you otherwise, nobody's going to recognize you out of costume.</p></div>"|14063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14063-head-first/|6.6|Marc Hogan

Hardly surprising, since Love Is All are one of the era's great punk bands. But wait: Should you really use the word ""punk"" to describe a band with such obvious ambitions beyond the guitar/bass/drums baseline? Because if you've heard Love Is All, you know they're hardly formalists: disco beats, post-punk sax honking, twee-pop boy-girl harmonies. They've got a definite sound, but within its boundaries they're thrillingly unconstrained.</p>
<p>Listen past the kitchen-sink sonic clutter, though, and <i>Two Thousand and Ten Injuries</i> could have wooed the same teen rabble as Sam the Sham and the Trashmen. After all, the garage and psych bands of the <i>Nuggets</i>-era also played ham-handed organs and saxes, and pounded their way through ethnic percussion and a hundred variations on the Bo Diddley beat. And nobody would describe <i>them</i> as post-punk. Take <i>TTaTI</i> opener ""Bigger Bolder"", with its learn-in-a-minute melody and reverb-ragged ""bad"" production. It's the kind of fuzzy, bouncy racket you could imagine blaring from jukeboxes in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>But then there are the lyrics. It's the lyrics that separate Love Is All from those garage rock pioneers and really connect them to the late-70s DIY explosion. Love Is All singer Josephine Olausson is one of the early 21st century's great poets of romantic dissatisfaction, and like the ladies of the Slits, the Raincoats, and the Delta 5, her take on bad romance is deeply personal, beyond post-punk pastiche. Her kiddie yelp, with its innate cuddliness when she goes soft and conversational, can sound like a precocious grade-schooler obsessed with her mom's copy of <i>Wanna Buy a Bridge?</i>. But the sugary cuteness is a smokescreen, hiding the kind of scalpel-edged self-examination most of us like to avoid at all costs.</p>
<p>Pay attention, and certain lines all but draw blood with their plain-spoken pain: ""I know I was acting a fool/ I remember you calling me cruel/ Well that was ages ago/ Oh how I wish I could prove how I've grown."" In Olausson's world, there are no predators and no victims. Just human beings, emotional fuck-ups trying to do a little better this time out, capable of life-changing kindness and casual cruelty in the same 12-month span. And accordingly, given Love Is All's mix of the unflinching and the playful, no one's left off the hook. Olausson knows that when a relationship cracks up, both parties are often to blame, and that failure was always a possibility. And still we try again, if only because it beats the alternative.</p>
<p>That kind of romantic realism, however witty or self-deprecating or full of non-sentimental pathos, makes Olausson's vulnerable moments all the more unexpected, and all the more effective as emotional sucker-punches. When she shouts, ""I want my head resting on a lap,"" on ""A Side in a Bed""-- over the kind of lovesick new wave worthy of a John Hughes climax-- you know she's lived enough to know the sacrifices behind the fantasy the music both celebrates and subverts.

But during a worrisome stretch for the Wu-Tang Clan that year, he seemed among the most likely to survive and even thrive if the Clan ceased to exist as a functioning group. Largely self-produced and forgoing any A-listers (U-God doesn't count), the album harbored no delusions about what it was meant to provide-- Deck ripping through one simile-laden verse after another with beats that stayed out his way. But since then, his fall-off has been dramatic, as he's rattled off increasingly less-noticed solo drops and sounded wholly uninspired on higher-profile Wu-related releases (remember ""keep it fresh like Tupperware"" from <i>8 Diagrams</i>?). It was easy to view last year's ""House Nigga"" as some sort of nadir, Deck spending five minutes dissing Joe Budden for his Internet fame. This was the guy whom even GZA was scared of following on ""Triumph""?</p>
<p>A more positive approach is to see the song as Deck's attempt to find his place in a galaxy of faded NYC stars; the wise ones realize they're not competing with Drake. At the outset, Deck seems aware of what could constitute a solid 2010 release on his part. Though the ringside samples of ""The Champion"" are beyond played, he still lets off rounds of impressively pugilistic internal rhyme. Meanwhile, the Obama-quoting ""Born Survivor"" continues the low-key revival of Cormega and reveals the image Deck wants to create for himself here, a grind-oriented street soldier not all that far removed from latter-day dead prez albums. They called it ""revolutionary but gangsta,"" while Inspectah boasts, ""Still I'm quick to pop it off/ With the model broads or the Molotovs.""</p>
<p>But as<i> Manifesto</i> runs through its forbidding 20-track playlist, it unsurprisingly falters when it chases Hot 97 spins that are laughably out of reach. The aluminum hand-claps of ""We Get Down"" evoke a G-Unit beat so generic that even Tony Yayo would take pause, ""T.R.U.E."" is a limp rap&amp;B overture for empire states of mind, and ""The Big Game"" is saddled with a cornball hook of a non-metaphor that can't fully commit to Auto-Tune. And while the relationship songs of <i>Uncontrolled Substance</i> offered an occasional glimpse behind Deck's otherwise stoic veneer, ""Luv Letter"" comes awfully close to Murs at his most needy.</p>
<p>But worse than the blind fumbling for hits is hearing what sounds like an average MC doing an uncanny Inspectah Deck impersonation. It's disorienting to hear him put such conviction behind subpar get-that-paper rhymes. And while Raekwon, Billy Danze, and Kurupt hold serve, ""Brothaz Respect"" houses quite possibly the most embarrassingly off-beat Cappadonna guest spot to date (and I've heard <i>The Yin and the Yang</i>), and too much of<i> Manifesto</i> is turned over to aggressively average foot soldiers like Fes Taylor and the indefensibly-named Carlton Fisk.</p>
<p>Look, it's no fun to criticize Deck for reaching for that brass ring. You can't help but think he realizes this disconnect during ""This Is It"", where he counters those who think he's slipped by boasting of ""A million kids thinkin' he rich/ A million bitches think he the shit."" Sadly, it shows how the dynamic's been reversed for Inspectah Deck since <i>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</i>-- you sit there and watch him play himself, knowing he's lying.</p></div>"|14049.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14049-manifesto/|5.2|Ian Cohen

But while its ideas were hardly groundbreaking, the band at least sounded like it was trying to create, rather than simply emulate. On the Danish quintet's <i>Sleep Mountain</i>, that is hardly the case. From the palm-muted chords and chiming bells that open it, this album is stained to the point of unintentional parody by the Arcade Fire's influence. If you think it's a coincidence, note that there is actually an accordion-festooned, we're-all-in-this-together shout-along called (wait for it) ""Don't Wake Up"".</p>
<p><i>Sleep Mountain</i>'s lack of originality is made worse by the fact that few of its songs actually go anywhere. Themes recycle themselves without providing much in the way of progression, and the few effective ideas, like the looped percussive beat in ""Painter"" or the new-wave romanticism of ""Beat Your Heartbeat"", are undercooked and underrealized. And it's not like the Kissaway Trail are working under strict time constraints-- almost every song that makes up the record's 55-minute length runs past the four-minute mark.</p>
<p>Those who brave the record's turgid front end will be treated to <i>Sleep Mountain</i>'s more interesting portion. The tangled guitar lines and mixed-back shouts on ""Whirr of Wings"" are faintly evocative of the better parts of 1990s emo, and despite a funereal accordion making another appearance, ""New Lipstick"" hits with a broad pop appeal reminiscent of their fellow countrymen, the underrated Figurines.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most listeners won't make it to these brief bright spots with the band's brutal cover of Neil Young's ""Philadelphia"" blocking the way. Young's frail voice (in full effect during his <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmaCQ4-2T5I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">performance at the 1993 Oscars</a>) created maximum emotional impact, while the Kissaway Trail's take is overblown, with its vocals processed to oblivion and dramatic orchestral swells adding layers of hyperbole that suffocate the simple, affecting melody. Ironically, it's here that <i>Sleep Mountain</i> is at its most worthwhile, teaching an important lesson: Without personality, pathos doesn't mean shit.</p></div>"|14057.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14057-sleep-mountain/|4.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

And now here's <i>The Optimist </i>with its Serious Artist design, but really it's just a preview for dance-rock at its most pro forma and drab, a triangulation of Garbage at their most blandly professional, Bloc Party at their least agitated, and Ladytron at their most bored.</p>
<p>At the center of it all is Tahita Bulmer, her deadpan voice previously lauded for conveying a nonchalant carnality on minor hits ""Ice Cream"" and ""The Bomb"". Not much has changed on that front, but <i>The Optimist </i>too often gets lost in non-committal melodies as Bulmer tries and tries again to capture quote-worthy elegant wastefulness-- ""You got the instinct/ Tell me what's the answer,"" ""We want to/ I don't want to do any of this without you,"" and the <i>coup de grâce</i>, ""Don't look at me now/ Look at my intellect/ The things I leave behind like footsteps.""</p>
<p>So much goes into this ice queen guise, and yet the best parts of <i>The Optimist </i>occur when she opens up on the hooks-- ""We Want To"" has a hands-in-the-air agreeability pulled fresh from the days of mandatory Franz Ferdinand rips, and opener ""Lost a Girl"" has a kinesis that's notably lacking on the rest of the LP. Memorable passages like these are lost amidst songs that stretch out to five minutes when they should be three, and are constructed nearly the same exact way in nearly the same exact tempo-- there's promise in the syncopated percussion of the title track, but it plods when it should glide, while ""Stone"" wastes the most intriguing keyboard overdubs by sloppily using them all at once.</p>
<p>In the end, <i>The Optimist </i>isn't just disappointing for people who believed in NYPC, but for people who want to believe in microgenres even when they are clearly not built for the long run. New Young Pony Club weren't nu-rave, blog-house, or French touch, but they didn't need to be-- their maximalist, fashion-forward, club-friendly aesthetic gave them enough philosophical congruence to benefit from the prevailing trends of the time. They seemed positioned as a latter-decade Ladytron, a bastion of aloof cool amidst an otherwise spazzy and day-glo scene. But Ladytron's <i>Witching Hour</i> proved that fantastic art could result from complimenting that facade with inspired songwriting, considered production, and an occasional peek at emotional resonance. Those qualities are absent from <i>The Optimist</i>, an album that pretty much shows NYPC content to ride this aloof cool thing out.</p></div>"|14061.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14061-the-optimist/|5.5|Ian Cohen

<p>Surprisingly, Neva Dinova's Jake Bellows gets the better of Oberst on the new material. Perhaps it's a matter of relativity-- Neva's 2008 LP <i>You May Already Be Dreaming</i> was dreary, lacking anything near the Cure-like flanged bass and escalating melodies of <i>One Jug</i>'s surprisingly celebratory leadoff track (""Rollerskating""). ""Someone's Love"" hews more toward Neva Dinova's typical barstool lamentations of busted romance, but it's far more ballsy than any of <i>Dreaming</i>'s longfaced weepers.</p>
<p>The results are decidedly more mixed on Oberst's contributions. Bright Eyes were never convincing as a rock band, and the transparency in which Desaparecidos <i>tried </i>to be a rock band always made it feel hollow. True to form, the distorted guitars prop up the chorus of ""Happy Accident"", but it can't help but come off as forced. Fortunately, Oberst is inspired to dip into the inkwell with his early-decade poison pen, dashing off brutal accusations at what could possibly be an abandoned young mother. But after that fit of inspired bile comes ""I Know You"", where Oberst gets all Colin Meloy with his diction and pronunciation (""brah-mbles"") within a stultifying, heavy-handed rhyme scheme that could pass for a next-level po-mo exercise of Oberst parodying himself parodying Dylan.</p>
<p>Don't confuse <i>One Jug</i>'s surprising revival as a sign of it being an acknowledged lost classic:<i> </i>Its six tracks are the Saddle Creek collective trying to reconcile emo's mainlined communication with the realest of all musics (non-Nashville country, naturally). All of it holds up fine-- the found sounds never feel tacked-on, and it's a good freeze-frame of a time when Mike Mogis' production really turned a corner. Oberst, too, displays growth here: With its cynical view on companionship and blatant references to cocaine abuse, ""I'll Be Your Friend"" hints at the lyrical direction of <i>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn.</i></p>
<p>But while the brief resurrection of the Bright Eyes name and the reissue of a relatively obscure recording may seem like the Saddle Creek people throwing us a bone, for the most part, the pleasure in making the record is what feels like its enduring quality-- as songwriters, Oberst and Bellows sound more comfortable than challenged here. As a tribute to once prolific and unique songwriting community, <i>One Jug </i>is better served as a reminder of how much outstanding and original music Saddle Creek produced from 2000-2003 rather than a document of it.</p></div>"|14035.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14035-one-jug-of-wine-two-vessels/|5.8|Ian Cohen

The band's basic riff is simple: Drummer Russell Simins pounds out brutal rhythms, guitarist Judah Bauer pummels repeated riffs mercilessly, and Spencer channels a frenzied mix of Elvis, Little Richard, and Ross Johnson. With no regard for the previous generation's interpretation of the blues-- Spencer is a living affront to Eric Clapton-- the Blues Explosion take everything tasteless and dangerous and ugly and irredeemable in rock and run with it. Their music is highly crafted and gloriously messy, heavily conceptual but still visceral, serious while also being funny. Nearly two decades after their formation, their music has outlived its superficial provocations and hits with a force that is perhaps even greater now than it was the first time around.</p>
<p><i>Dirty Shirt Rock 'n' Roll</i> surveys the years between their 1992 debut and 2002's <i>Plastic Fang</i>. Unlike the consistently name-checked and beloved Pavement, another Matador band with a new retrospective in stores, the Blues Explosion seem ripe for re-evaluation. The early-2000s garage rock revival and the success of the White Stripes have given us a new context to hear these disarrayed blues-rock excursions, which similarly peel back the layers to get to rock's core elements.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, however, when Spencer was a contemporary of Steve Malkmus, Robert Pollard, and Mac MacCaughan, this music sounded so far removed from any particular scene that the band could be easily dismissed as an anomaly. In retrospect, Spencer's real peers may have been the Afghan Whigs' Greg Dulli and Beck, artists who had very specific ideas about how to transform African-American music traditions into a personal style that made sense to the alt-rock nation. Unlike either of them, Spencer borrowed almost exclusively from pre-Beatles sources: blaring mid-century blues riffs, outlandish vocals from some fever dream of the 50s, and no truck with niceties like song structure. Tracks like ""Chicken Dog"" (a great duet with the late Rufus Thomas) and the slithery ""Afro"" meander aggressively, as if demanding and daring you to keep up. ""Bellbottoms"", one of JSBX's better-known singles, doesn't even get started until nearly two minutes in, by which time the band has been hammering away next to a string arrangement by Lalo Schifrin. The song screeches to a halt and peels out again in the direction of a terrifically catchy call-and-response chant. How do the two halves connect? These guys could care less.</p>
<p>As the decade wore on, the Blues Explosion began tinkering with their fairly austere sound, which lead to collaborations with Dan the Automator and Alec Empire. If at the time they seemed to have lost the thread, <i>Dirty Shirt Rock 'n' Roll</i> argues that they still held firm to their core values. Moving back and forth in time, with no regard whatsoever for intelligible chronology, the comp holds together remarkably well, like a good live setlist or a friend's mixtape. Guests from Beck to hard-living R&amp;B legend Andre Williams sit naturally with the Blues Explosion's sparer guitar-drums-Theremin breakdowns, suggesting that for all their reliance on decades-old styles and gestures, these gloriously messy songs live in the present. Whatever you or Spencer or anyone else calls it, this music is just as exciting and alienating now as it was then.</p></div>"|14038.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14038-dirty-shirt-rock-n-roll-the-first-ten-years/|8.3|Stephen M.

Here Sufjan's presence makes a little bit more sense. Like his Scandinavian co-conspirators, Sufjan likes his jams elaborate. And though the absurdly titled <i>S-M 2: Abyss in B Minor</i> might not bring the layered twee overkill of, say, <i>Illinois</i>, it's still busy as all hell.</p>
<p>This time around, Serena-Maneesh face down the <i>Loveless</i> challenge more directly and bravely than any of their neo-shoegaze peers. While most effects-pedal new jacks are content to let their guitar whoosh enhance their diffuse hooks, Serena-Maneesh use noise and pop <i>against</i> each other, staging an internal war in every single track. The band does write hooks, but those hooks have to claw their way through layers of wriggling noise to reach sunlight. To get to track two, album-highlight and single ""I Just Want to See Your Face"", you have to make it through ""Ayisha Abyss"", a seven-minute instrumental motorik dirge caked in crackly, inscrutable shards of walkie-talkie chatter. And you'd think ""Face"", a three-minute love song, would prove a lot friendlier, but no, not really. Even there, everything seems to be fighting everything else, as staticy half-formed guitar riffs push against each other, and the melody, while pretty, never quite resolves. Serena-Maneesh make your ears <i>work</i>.</p>
<p>More often than not, they reward that work. There's nearly as much <i>XTRMNTR</i>-era Primal Scream here as there is MBV. It's fun just to hear the way they orchestrate all the chaos on a song like ""Honeyjinx"", where, at any given moment, you'll hear quasi-medieval flute-tootles, windchimes, narcotized vocals, and gigantically misanthropic doom-metal riffage. On the album-closing ""Magdalena (Symphony #8)"", acoustic guitars and rippling bongos sweeten the mood but can't pierce the thick, viscous coat of synthetic drone that slathers everything.</p>
<p>But the problem with any album that invites this many comparisons to <i>Loveless</i> is simply that it's not <i>Loveless</i>. As on that album, the songs feel like they're whirling so far into the stratosphere that they might fly apart any second. But the basic melodies on <i>Loveless</i> were strong enough to carry the burden of the effects, and the same can't always be said about Serena-Maneesh. Like Primal Scream, they rely a little too much on seething cool when any sort of deeper feeling would go a long way. Elvira Nikolaisen's vocals may have a certain mysterious, icy beauty, but it's not the kind that hints at big things going on beneath the surface. Meanwhile, when her frontman brother Emil sings, he doesn't even have the icy-beauty thing to fall back on. So it's easy to admire the roiling conviction that makes the album go, but it's a lot harder to love the actual songs that that conviction yields.</p></div>"|14029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14029-s-m-2-abyss-in-b-minor/|6.4|Tom Breihan

Its diffuse, bruise-colored skies illustrate not only the band's meteorological obsessions-- it's not just the band name; almost every song here references rain or clouds or ice-- but also the gauzy sound of its music. And just as a brilliant beam of sunlight penetrates the cover's cloudy horizon, the vocals of drummer Sarah Winchester and guitarist/songwriter Aaron Gerber poke through the band's musical haze. Together or separately, her silvery coo and his drowsy whisper cut through the songs' airy, dreamy ambiance with pointed delicacy.</p>
<p>Much of what distinguishes A Weather, however, from other gentle, spare singer/songwriters and indie folkies is their albums' thoughtful, high-quality production. <i>Everyday Balloons</i>, like 2008's <i>Cove</i>, is restrained without being sparse and manages to feel cozy without resorting to lo-fi bedroom acoustics. Produced by Adam Selzer (who has worked with the Decemberists and M. Ward), the album has a hard-won sheen. In lesser hands, these sleepy/stoned breakup songs could be mawkish or, worse, forgettable. But grounded in a strong slowcore aesthetic, A Weather smartly strike a balance between lush, evocative instrumentation and concise, essential arrangements.</p>
<p>For a band that leaves so much open space in their songs (and therefore creates room for listeners to pay attention to and place emphasis on their lyrics), A Weather have carved out an unusual lyrical landscape. Yes, there is an overarching sadness to their work, but their painstakingly constructed songs never seem personal or confessional. As a result-- rather than feel like hangdog character studies-- they manage to capture both minutely imagined details and suggestive, opaque poetry.</p>
<p>Despite the strong melodies and arrangements of LP highlights ""Ducks in a Row"" and ""No Big Hope"", <i>Everyday Balloons</i> falls short of the high watermark set by <i>Cove</i>. Perhaps that's because it is a plugged-in collection, and the band's anesthetized grief is a better match for its acoustic predecessor, or perhaps it's because these more ambitious compositions require swells and segues that the band hasn't quite mastered yet. But despite these faults, the album is still laudably subtle and sadly pretty. And patient listeners will be rewarded.</p></div>"|14048.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14048-everyday-balloons/|7.0|Rebecca Raber

Since their last collaboration, 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10748-fire-escape/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fire Escape</i></a>, Hebden has been busy, re-establishing himself as one of electronic music's crossover stars. For Sunburned, well, it's been business as usual: according to this band-endorsed <a href=""http://www.myrecordcollection.org/artists/sunburned/shotmpage.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">discography</a>, the group has released 48 albums/tapes/CD-Rs and one book since <i>Fire Escape</i> (winning album title from this period: <i>Weekend at Burnie's 2</i>). There's no tip-toeing around the notion that <i>A</i> stands out in Sunburned's catalog mostly because of Hebden's presence. Toning, sculpting, and orchestrating, Hebden again turns Sunburned into an ethereal, electronic version of themselves.</p>
<p>Sunburned have kept <i>A</i> close to the vest. Whereas <i>Fire Escape</i>-- released on Norway's increasingly promiment Smalltown Supersound-- received a reasonable promotional push, <i>A</i> is a limited-run, vinyl-only (with download card) release on Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace. Recorded live in-studio in Southern Vermont, <i>A</i> feels like the work of a fairly tight group. On <i>Fire Escape</i>, the burly collective was wrangled into Kraut-rock rhythms but retained some of their unkempt chattering and lumbering bass. <i>A</i>, though, smolders and teases.</p>
<p>The give-and-take in this collaboration seems sort of obvious: Hebden is freed to waste moments (in a positive way) while Sunburned are gifted with the tightest and most controlled compositions in their considerable body of work. ""Arp and Hammer"" is a rhythm-less tone poem that bridges the record's halves; ""Radish vs. Beet"" contains a whinnying synth that builds a small amount of momentum before being cut off. Four of <i>A</i>'s 11 tracks clock under 70 seconds. Sunburned find room for their jams, too, though. ""A Red Rag to a Bull"" features gnarled drum programming and improvisations from the band's usual array of acoustic string instruments. ""Action Figure"" is a wonder, offering a sturdy, dance-able electro-bass and chiming radar blips.</p>
<p>Hebden doesn't tame Sunburned so much as direct their energy. The result generates plenty of heat, but it's small and concentrated. <i>Fire Escape</i> retained some of Sunburned's manic bigness; <i>A</i> feels self-contained and distressingly tiny. When the album ends and iTunes rolls into a Finnish live set the band released, a deliriously derivative and silly guitar riff totally erases any memory of ""Alpha, Beta, Adam""'s three minutes of pleasant drone. Sunburned may ultimately be suited to bigger, lesser sounds than <i>A</i> offers. That's fine: Heaven knows Sunburned produce plenty of music without Hebden, too.</p></div>"|14059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14059-a/|5.9|Andrew Gaerig

Absent from that laundry list is the first artist LCD ever covered, Harry Nilsson, whose ""Jump Into the Fire"" was an early live staple and eventual ""Daft Punk is Playing at My House"" B-side. Nilsson's weird 70s run of records approximate an accurate depiction of the L.A. experience, describing in his gentle, decaying falsetto the melancholy beneath the surface of sunny days and movie stars. So what better time for Murphy to indulge his inner Nilsson than when he's given the chance to go Hollywood, handling film score duties for Noah Baumbach's <i>Greenberg</i>. If previews are to be trusted, <i>Greenberg</i> itself finds Ben Stiller's main character down and out in L.A., so voila, the perfect storm for Murphy to finally make his own version of a sadsack record like <i>Nilsson Schmilsson</i>.</p>
<p>Nowhere is that more apparent than ""Photographs"", the only song to appear in both vocal and instrumental form among 11 tracks credited here to Murphy. A woozy acoustic guitar and piano ballad, it's as far away from LCD Soundsystem as it is close to being a standard-issue indie film soundtrack piece. It also unfortunately is a succinct portrait of the gulf between Murphy and Nilsson, as the former's voice bears more cracks than a dropped carton of eggs-- more the ""partied all night with John Lennon"" Nilsson of <i>Pussy Cats</i> than the vocal showstopper performance of ""Without You"". Murphy's singing has gotten a lot better since he basically monologued his way through the first LCD singles, but it's still better left disguised on the solo-Lennon howl of ""Oh You (Christmas Blues)"" (credited, strangely, to LCDSS) or the Cecilia-ish folk jam of ""If You Need a Friend"".</p>
<p>As far as the non-Murphy tracks, there's no Nilsson song to draw stark comparison. But a substitute measuring stick is provided by Stroke-Dad Albert Hammond, whose ""It Never Rains in Southern California"" is perfect L.A. pop-- depression and misanthropy wrapped in exquisite production. It's also exceedingly passive, which fits thematically with the Steve Miller Band's ""Jet Airliner"", Duran Duran's wonderful ""The Chauffeur"", and Galaxie 500's ""Strange"". Good songs all, but I'm thinking there are a lot of shots of a sad, unshaven Ben Stiller looking out the window and wondering where it all went wrong.</p>
<p>With his score, Murphy doesn't do much to shake the main character out of that presumed self-pity. The instrumental numbers here are low-key wallpaper (save the flamenco-style ""Gente"", which sounds more fit for Baumbach's buddy Wes Anderson), and many of the vocal tracks sound sparse and half-realized. It is a peek at a singer-songwriter side of Murphy that we haven't previously glimpsed, but searching for clues about the LCD Soundsystem LP due later this year is probably a futile effort-- Greenberg has side project written all over it. Love letter to Harry Nilsson or Greater Los Angeles, it's partly cloudy; as much as New York may be bringing Murphy down, it's a more appropriate muse.</p></div>"|14039.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14039-greenberg-ost/|5.3|Rob Mitchum

The tension between those two poles-- refusing to grow up and yearning to move on-- is the emotional engine that drives the band and its impressively confident record.</p>
<p>The members of Let's Wrestle are barely out of their teens, which helps explain their uncanny knack for articulating the pain of youth. Despite their age, they take most of their reference points from the shaggy, careening indie rock of the mid-1990s, an era in full force when they were in diapers. Singer/songwriter and guitarist Wesley Patrick Gonzalez ladles big bursts of overcharged guitar onto his winsome pop songs, and his cracked, hoarse voice recalls Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis. The songs don't advance so much as stumble drunkenly from one section to the next, and Gonzalez himself is a blurter: ""I've got only one function, and that's to mess things up,"" he admits (or boasts) on ""I'm in Love With Destruction"". The album is full of this kind of compulsive truth-telling-- ""I Won't Lie to You"", a galloping punk tune opens with a devastatingly honest realization: ""No matter how many records I buy, I can't fill this void.""</p>
<p>Gonzalez clearly <i>has</i> bought a lot of records though, and while they might not have cured his loneliness, they have boosted his songwriting. You can hear echoes of little-known but well-loved indie and punk bands he has in his collection. Some popular albums, too: <i>Parklife</i>-era Blur make an appearance in ""My Schedule"", in which the narrator offers a deadpan list of all the mundane things he's going to do today. ""Diana's Hair"", a disarmingly mournful ode to Princess Diana, recalls the sort of plainspoken story-songs the Kinks used to pen. All of it is worn pretty lightly, though-- witness the album's title, a completely ridiculous nod to King Crimson and an indicator these kids keep their influences at arms-length, where they can bat playfully at them. On ""Song for Old People"", Gonzalez squints and tries to imagine what happens to you when you grow old; the worst he can come up with is  ""their sense of humor may be lost."" Considering that in a recent interview, Gonzalez revealed that he intends to title the band's next record <i>Trout Mask Wrestlica</i>, it seems, for him, those days are far, far away.</p></div>"|14055.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14055-in-the-court-of-the-wrestling-lets/|7.6|Jayson Greene

It's in this context that Motor City Drum Ensemble's <i>Raw Cuts, Vol. 1</i> sounds so refreshing: It is straightforward, effusive dance music spun from the most basic of elements, and done very, very well.</p>
<p>A showcase for MCDE's eponymous label, <i>Raw Cuts, Vol. 1</i> compiles three Raw Cuts 12""'s, labelmate Jayson Brothers' debut single, and three exclusive tracks. Clearly indebted to the dance music developed in Chicago and Detroit since the mid-1980s, MCDE (Danilo Plessow, from Stuttgart, Germany) aligns himself with electronic musicians deadly serious about placing music before image. Fortunately, Plessow's music isn't concerned with evasion. Open and melodic, <i>Raw Cuts</i> overflows with warm electric keys and cracking rhythms. Tension is massed then resolved with big, descending chords and wily guitar. Looped vocals roam in and out of the mix like shouts from the other side of the floor.</p>
<p>Plessow, though, isn't just toying with 1980s dance nostalgia. <i>Raw Cuts</i> often sounds like dance music constructed by and for people who grew up listening to dusty, 1990s hip-hop. His sliced-up funk and interlocking slogans make ""Raw Cuts #3"" sound like a dissertation-length exploration of a J Dilla beat. ""Raw Cuts #2"" could be a clear-headed, taking-their-medicine Avalanches jam. We associate madcap samplers like those with a certain skittishness, but Plessow's sounds are thrillingly, ingenuously focused.</p>
<p>Brothers' contributions nearly split the album in two, both through their placement and their lingering funk. ""Monster Box"" is still electronic music, but its brawny shuffle sounds like it could be the product of a particularly amped backing band. ""All My Life""'s sunken steps provide a base for the symphonic-soul strings.</p>
<p>The source material ensures that <i>Raw Cuts</i> never veers into giddy, Technicolor party music, and there are times when these tracks feel like a really great party viewed in sepia tones. Take that as you will, but a slightly muted great party is still a <i>great party</i>. <i>Raw Cuts</i> is your first opportunity to hear the young, ultra-talented Plessow on disc. His warm, everyman house music is as sturdy and lived-in as his adopted hometown.</p>

Bassist Alex Bleeker's first solo EP is in front of the Freaks, a gang that's more Crazy Horse than Galaxie 500, and one that happens to include Real Estate frontman Martin Courtney and guitarist Matthew Mondanile. (The former has taken over bass duty, while the latter bangs drums.) The sonics are similarly submerged, but the pop format is much different: this is Strumming Country, tone trumps texture. Bleeker's got a fantastic ear for steering his crew's floating-mattress sensibility toward the classic rock side of things. As instrumental (duh) opener ""Summer"" winds its way into ""Epilogue"", Bleeker signals the shift with some chord-slamming. When the volume jumps, Bleeker begins to whinny in a register as Neil Young-like as the crispy guitar Julian Lynch jabs throughout. That said, the guitar interplay clearly comes from the gut in a way that allows for the kind of total freedom that these dudes and their many stripes of song seem to hold so dear.</p>
<p><span>Lyrically, Bleeker keeps his songs in familiar territory. There's summer and there's spring, and everybody's either hanging out or remembering times when they did. On ""Prisoner of the Past"", Bleeker gets old-timey as he sings about a friendship that's run its course. It's a really short verse before the guitar starts squaking, but in a few lines he (probably inadvertently) bottles up the hypernostalgic vibes that bleed into all of bandmates work, together or alone. </span></p>
<p><span>It's hard not to notice all the fun that's being had messing around with the rock grid here, the ways in which you can make a trusted blueprint your own simply by stamping it so. When Real Estate jam, they do so in a way that's flush with Courtney's indie rock vision. When Mondanile runs off on his hypnogogic spirit journeys as Ducktails, he solos his way to infinity. Even though each of Bleeker's songs here are ultimately interchangeable in layout, their warmth is not. On ""Animal Tracks"", a blistering cover of a song by Vermont's Mountain Man, the Freaks sing in unison of sipping Barq's root beer and hanging out on a set of backstairs. It quickly recalls Real Estate's ""Suburban Beverage"", a song most easily identified by the chant, ""Budweiser, Sprite, do you feel alright?"" The drink may be different, but the buzz comes from the very same place.</span></p></div>"|14044.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14044-alex-bleeker-and-the-freaks/|7.3|David Bevan

It's not that<i> Total Magique</i> has aged poorly; that album, with its multi-lingual lyrics, blistering, noisy synthesizer melodies, and aggressive rhythms, holds up well given the mass exhaustion with its dance-punk genre. But We Are Wolves' overall approach, as proved by their latest, <i>Invisible Violence</i>, has worn thin.</p>
<p>Even the band seems bored with their chosen genre, and they can't seem to muster the level of intensity that once set their electro-rock apart. These tepid tunes are spare where their predecessors were crowded with noise, and the mid-tempo dynamic is just animated enough to get asses on the dancefloor but not vigorous enough to inspire a frenzy. The band's buzzing analog synthesizers used to be the weapon of choice, but <i>Invisible Violence</i> favors guitars to drive the songs, leaving keyboards for bass flourishes or electronic decoration. These changes dilute what was once vibrant and original about the band.</p>
<p>The best song on<i> Total Magique</i>, ""Fight &amp; Kiss"", pulses with sinister sexual energy and a dangerously relentless beat as Alexander Ortiz sings about volatile passion that conflates fighting and fucking. But the best songs on this new collection are sweaty, almost sweet disco tracks like ""Blue"", with its percolating groove and glossy melody. And the lyrics throughout are softly emotional (""I am going somewhere where my tears won't fall and my heart won't break,"" Ortiz sings on ""Near Fear"") or languorously poetic (the aptly named ""Dreams"" opens with the line, ""Reflection of the moonlight on the suede of my skin""). There's nothing wrong with tempering one's stance or mellowing out-- and to We Are Wolves' credit, the slowest, spaciest numbers here are the most unexpected and most satisfying-- but the driving momentum and risky harshness of past efforts are missed. <i>Invisible Violence</i> finds We Are Wolves losing their taste for gory, carnal aggression, and with it, a little bit of their sense of self.</p></div>"|14027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14027-invisible-violence/|5.8|Rebecca Raber

Actors from Eddie Murphy to Don Johnson to Lindsay Lohan record albums so that we can laugh at their hubris and casually dismiss their efforts. The story is so common it's created a Hollywood archetype: the actor-turned-singer-turned-punchline. But Zooey Deschanel is rewriting the script. With She &amp; Him's <i>Volume One</i>, her first collaboration with M. Ward, she proved that not only could she act, write songs, and sing, but she could do them all very well, with a sparkle of personality glinting in those big eyes and bigger voice.</p>
<p><i>Volume Two</i> picks up almost exactly where <i>Volume One</i> left off, with Deschanel still playing a smart, sensitive young woman often on the unrequited end of love but never letting romantic disappointment get her down: ""Sometimes lonely isn't sad,"" she declares on the stately opener ""Thieves"". She's still the headstrong heroine, though: ""Why do I always want to sock it to you hard?"" she wonders on ""Over It Over Again"", sounding as playfully frustrated as Loretta Lynn. And Ward remains content to cede her the spotlight, toiling behind the camera. He dresses her songs in deceptively simple SoCal folk rock, dusty cowboy-trail country music, and crisp Brill Building pop. The similarities to <i>Volume One</i> don't make <i>Volume Two</i> redundant, but reassuring: It's not typecasting if the role is this complex.</p>
<p>On the sequel, Deschanel seems more confident as a singer, songwriter, and vocal arranger. She still has more personality than range, but has learned to maneuver around the parts she can't nail in order to sell them. Transforming herself into her own version of the Watson Twins, Deschanel often backs up herself and channels 1960s country gold classics on the languid ""Me and You"" and the plaintive ""Brand New Shoes"", pointing to older styles but never sounding beholden to the past. Her ah-has and mm-hmms make her cover of Skeeter Davis' ""Gonna Get Along Without You Now"" sound impossibly perky, as if she's lighter for having dumped that creep, and on closer ""If You Can't Sleep"", Ward layers her humming into a gentle orchestra that add
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
s to the song's lullaby sweetness.</p>
<p>He has a lot of tricks like that up his sleeves. If <i>Volume One</i> seemed a bit compartmentalized, each song working one idea or genre, <i>Volume Two </i>sounds much more synthesized as Ward mixes so many styles into each song. It never plays like an M. Ward album, though, as he tailors the music to fit her deceptively simple songs. As Deschanel fashions a romantic metaphor out of the myth of Orpheus, Ward adds some Beach Boys orchestration to reinforce that sense of longing, that rolling snare suggesting a slow, painful look backwards. An unlikely protégé of Owen Bradley, Ward adds countrypolitan strings to many of these songs, but never crowds her vocals or steps on her lines. In fact, it's easy to forget he's even there, so that his verse on their cover of NRBQ's ""Ridin' in My Car"" has the force of a surprise cameo, turning the he-said/she-said story into a hipster <i>Grease</i>.</p>
<p>Even as they look to the past for inspiration-- specifically, to some never-was heyday of 60s radio-- they aren't making a period piece on <i>Volume Two. </i>What makes the album so distinctive isn't just the sound of her voice, the quality of her songwriting, or even the resourcefulness of his arrangements, but their joint insistence that these old sounds have as much to say nowadays as they ever did. In that regard, She &amp; Him has given Deschanel her best role yet, one that shows off her charm and intelligence to best effect-- one that she is essentially writing for herself.</p></div>"|14036.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14036-volume-two/|7.6|Stephen M.

The production duo's energetic 12-hour online radio broadcast from earlier this month-- joyfully tweeted about and linked to by fans-- was a massive, almost exhausting display of influences and favorites. Floating between Coil and Lord Quas, the mix inspired someone to crowdsource the track list on Google Docs.</p>
<p><i>Oversteps </i>takes a much quieter approach, focusing on a smaller scale. Coming after 2008's <i>Quaristice</i>, a varied collection of shorter tracks that originated during live jam sessions, <i>Oversteps</i> leans toward some of the slower, more atmospheric aspects of albums like <i>Amber (</i>minus the metered pulse). After the album's initial 20 seconds of silence, the opener ""r ess"" slowly surfaces-- cold, distant synths arc overhead while broken, incomplete rhythms clatter and collide-- seemingly suggesting that steady beats aren't the main focus here.</p>
<p>Many tracks, such as ""O=0"" and ""d-sho qub"", do contain propulsive rhythms, and a slow funk and dull handclap seep through ""Treale"". But the textures are where things get interesting. Whether it's from tones floating in space or notes brushing up against each other in quiet but effective dischord, the ambience and atmospheres of <i>Oversteps </i>are haunting. ""st epreo"" expands and contorts with bass notes that seem bound to the rules of fluid dynamics. ""Yuop"" steadily builds and crests with ringing, grandiose synths. Sometimes, the lack of propulsion distracts, like on ""pt2ph8"". But the overlapping round of notes in ""see on see"" points to a clear design within the synthetic ether.</p>
<p>Autechre have evoked heavy moods while pushing the possibilities of production technology forward and broadening the vocabulary of electronic music. The famous video for their track ""Gantz Graf"" suggests as much, that they harnessed the grating sounds of a machine in the middle of a grand mal seizure. <i>Oversteps </i>finds them working in a comparatively less rigid fashion, almost organic compared to something like <i>Confield.</i> Focusing on creating tension and release within their compositions, they're still incorporating new designs, not merely repackaging the previous products.</p></div>"|14051.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14051-oversteps/|7.2|Patrick Sisson

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Method Actors thrived in the 1980s in Athens, Ga., in the same scene that gave rise to R.E.M., the B-52's, Pylon, Love Tractor, and many more. This was the Athens shrouded in tangles of wild kudzu and the kind of homey eccentricity on display in the great rock-doc <i>Athens, Ga.-Inside/Out</i><span>, in which pretty much everyone and everything seems weird in some way. In the liner notes to this great new reissue CD, Method Actors guitarist Vic Varney talks about Athens as an inviting little town and calls Ricky Wilson from the B-52's his ""favorite rock and roll guitar player. Ever."" And R.E.M.'s Peter Buck, no slouch of a guitarist himself, writes of harboring much Method Actors love in his Athens days and standing in front of Varney night after night ""watching his hands and trying to figure how he did what he did.""</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">What Varney did was striking, and really does count as some of the most distinctive post-punk guitar work ever done. The same goes for his bandmate David Gamble, who played drums in a way that was highly versatile and even more highly musical. That was it for the Method Actors: two guys, both with wild styles that grew all the more wild as they grew more tightly coiled. And with the release of this reissue record, <i>This Is Still It</i>, they still sound as thrilling as they did 30 years ago.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>This Is Still It</i><span> opens with ""Do the Method"", a blast of a song that sounds like the work of way more than a duo. Varney's guitar traffics in a beautiful mess of open-tuned jangle and jags, with a complex sense of internal melody that could handle the duty of a hook on its own. Gamble's drums fan out and spray the space with frenetic kicks pumped beneath all the splashy cymbals and fills. And then the vocals: a cloying, toying mix
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
of insouciant sass and arty call-and-response jabs, all delivered with an unhinged sense of preening and play.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That's pretty much the Method Actors method condensed, and it plays out to deliriously rewarding and consistent effect on a CD that collects songs recorded from 1980 to 1981. Hints of other sounds from before and after drift in-- DNA, Polvo, Gang of Four, Captain Beefheart-- but the Method Actors sound too wound up in their mania to get distracted by anything from the outside. Here really<i> is</i><span> a total find from what would almost have</span><i> </i><span>to be an empty post-punk vault at this point. And it's a find that sounds like it lost no sleep while waiting around to be found again.</span></p></div>"|14033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14033-this-is-still-it/|8.3|Andy Battaglia

And just as Obama is, for better or worse, an inspiring figure whose influence isn't quite in sync with his accomplishments, Muldrow can sometimes come across as an amazing artist in theory: She hasn't totally delivered on the promise hinted at by her debut album, <i>Olesi: Fragments of an Earth</i>. It's not her inspirations or intentions that are in doubt. But hope is a campaign, not a governing strategy; similarly, dropping spiritual signifiers and referencing legends Nina Simone and Alice Coltrane doesn't necessarily make great music.</p>
<p>But <i>Kings Ballad</i> stands on its own, a vessel for Muldrow's lyrics and beliefs. It sounds more concentrated, cohesive, and restrained than previous albums, especially her binge of releases last year. Soulful where she was occasionally brash, her voice pivots and floats but sounds more grounded and assured, like on ""Doobie Down"", where she calmly vamps over her own coos and chorus (""No apologies, I'll be as black as I want to be""). It flows well, outside of a final stretch of songs seemingly tacked on for variety, including vaguely Latin ""Morena Del Ray"", vocoded sci-fi riff ""Industrial Bap"", and the senseless pop-punk outlier ""Room Punk!"".</p>
<p>Throbbing low end plays well with jazzy piano throughout the album, like the riff on ""Indeed"" and the elegiac, descending line on ""R.I.P."", an ode to Michael Jackson that achieves a certain tension by ending on a snapped beat. The instrumental passages, including the liquid funk-lite of ""Chocolate Reign"" and chugging ""R.I.P."", are decent. Her beats aren't the most adventurous take on splashy, one-two rhythms, but they work here. <i>Kings Ballad</i> still doesn't meet all the expectations Muldrow may have initially inspired, but it's a positive, measured sign that there's more to come.</p></div>"|13913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13913-kings-ballad/|6.9|Patrick Sisson

There's of course that cinematic pseudonym, alluding to a Hollywood epic almost half a century old. There's also his unyielding devotion to 1960s pop music, which treats the Beatles catalog as untrod territory. But mostly it's the New Zealander's steadfast refusal to join any current pop trend, indie or otherwise, which seems a bit surprising given that Milne has played with the Ruby Suns, the Brunettes, and Okkervil River. He distances himself so far from the present that he actually sounds somewhat distinctive. Pop history, however, is littered with those who have taken up the Fab mantle to high praise, from Jim Noir all the way back to Todd Rundgren and beyond.</p>
<p>Which is only to say that Milne is no outsider. His well-schooled command of hooks and pomp does not make him unique, just obsessive and perhaps a bit single-minded. In fact, his debut's primary limitation is that for all his fifth-Beatle vocals and the loose Höfner plunk of his basslines, <i>Chant Darling </i>seeks to imitate, not to innovate. At times it sounds like nothing we haven't heard before, but there are, of course, pleasures to be found in this approach, like the snaky guitar and snappy hook of ""Apple Pie Bed"", the chipper calypso sample that forms the rhythmic foundation of ""Auckland CBD Part Two"", or the decadent languor of ""I've Smoked Too Much"". Milne lets a lot of ideas loose on this album, and occasionally they get away from him. In particular, he has a tendency to repeat phrases and melodies, striving for hynotic but more often achieving tedious. ""The Undesirables"" run its sleepy hook into the ground in just two minutes, and ""The Beautiful Young Crew"" tugs obsessively at its knotty melody.</p>
<p>Lyrically, Milne can be slyly witty and genially self-deprecating, as on the opener, ""Like a Fool"". ""I'm on the ground, girl, I'm thrashing 'round,"" he sings. ""It's easy to see what this display is for, to show you what you mean to me."" In addition to anchoring him in the here and now, that sense of haplessness is at direct odds with the song's dapper arrangements; if his thoughts are scattered, his music remains suave and martini sophisticated. <i>Chant Darling</i> doesn't hit strike that balance often enough, and very few of these songs allow such a glimpse of the musician behind them. Ultimately, Lawrence Arabia's carefully tailored influences have the same effect as that stage name, as if Milne was intent on absenting himself from his own album.</p></div>"|14024.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14024-chant-darling/|6.3|Stephen M.

It was breezy without being drifty, humorous without being goofy, and even tender and romantic when it needed to be. The production was effortlessly bouyant-- its tropical synths and stuttering beats propping up cooing vocals-- and even during a season that saw no shortage of balmy sounds, the album still felt like a warm gust of Mediterranean air.</p>
<p>Since then jj have revealed their identities (Joakim Benon and Elin Kastlander from Gothenburg, it turns out) and after justifiably wide praise for <i>jj n° 2</i>, moved from boutique imprint Sincerely Yours to the larger Secretly Canadian. And even though it's only been about eight months since their debut was released, jj already have the follow-up, <i>jj n° 3</i>, ready to go. It isn't clear what prompted them to put the album out so quickly (maybe they wanted to capitalize on all the attention, maybe they're just prolific songwriters) but despite a couple of memorable tracks, <i>jj n° 3</i> is uniformly worse than its predecessor and a curious step down for the group.</p>
<p>Song to song, the album lacks the charm and melodies of <i>jj n° 2</i>, but even on a general level there's a tonal shift here that doesn't suit jj well. Instead of narcotized, sun-drenched pop, the duo have embraced a softer, bleary sound that at worst feels almost New Age-y or Enya-esque. It's a bit like the detour fellow Swede El Perro Del Mar took with her second album, <i>From the Valley to the Stars</i>, in which she embraced darker, more somber textures to mixed effect. As fans, we of course expect artists to explore new styles, and the party line on <i>jj n° 3</i> is that it's intended to be a winter record instead of a summer one; the problem here is that the album simply sounds adrift. With wispy, beat-less production, tracks like ""And Now"" and ""Light"" are slight-- the type of songs you hear and then instantly forget.</p>
<p>The record does have its moments, but they don't come often. One of the endearing things about <i>jj n° 2</i> was its use of chart hip-hop, most notably the druggy Lil Wayne semi-cover ""Ecstasy"". They repeat that trick on opener ""My Life"", copping Wayne's verse from the Game song of the same title. It's not as cute the second time around, but there's still something appealing about hearing Kastlander sing lyrics like, ""They say you ain't grindin' until you die,"" in her honey-coated vocal manner. Late in the record, the perky ""You Know"" also stands up to the quality of <i>jj n° 2</i>, but between these tracks is mostly B-side fare. It's a shame, but I don't get the sense listening to <i>jj n° 3</i> that jj's best work is behind them. Let's hope this is a temporary setback.</p></div>"|14045.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14045-jj-n-3/|5.4|Joe Colly

His alternate vision of the universe, which he laid out in the controversial 1950 bestseller <i>Worlds In Collision</i>, reads suspiciously like the plot to <i>Stargate</i>: ancient mythology, astrology, and astrophysics woven together into the kind of vividly apocalyptic swirl that attracts cults of believers. Velikovsky's theories, unfortunately for him, were debunked by every reputable physicist of the era.</p>
<p>It's easy to see the appeal this doomed, charismatic fringe figure might have for a melodramatic goth-rock band. This is where Junius comes in: their second full-length is a loose concept album about Velikovsky's life and trials. He is the ""catastrophist"" of the title, and a recording of his thickly accented voice, straight out of mad-scientist Central Casting, graces the album's opening. Here Junius treat Velikovsky not unlike how metal bands behold Aleister Crowley: a compelling Faustian figure, a man who was punished by society for his forays into forbidden realms of knowledge.</p>
<p>Junius are not a metal band, however. In spirit and sound, the Boston quartet are closest to darkwave bands of the 1980s, a kinship that only begins with lead singer and guitarist Joseph E Martinez's pitch-perfect Robert Smith wail. Like the bands they resemble (Tears for Fears, the Cure, and Depeche Mode, primarily), Junius have a knack for translating weepy melodrama into anthemic choruses. Almost every song makes its careful way through a maze of subsections, but this maneuvering is often hidden behind an instantly memorable hook, which tends to make the record's esoteric conceit melt away instantly. ""We are so curious,"" Martinez howls on ""Ten-Year Librarian"", a song that is ostensibly about Velikovsky staying up endless nights to rewrite his life-changing thesis, but a line that probably resonates just as powerfully with sexually repressed teenagers.</p>
<p>The sound of the record is similarly stadium-ready. The reverb is cranked to cavernous levels, so that every isolated sound-- the glimmering Interpol-style guitar leads, the hi-hat cymbal washes, the unison ""whoa-oh-oh"" vocals-- spirals endlessly upward into a starlit sky. ""The Antedeluvian Fire"" has tinkling chimes doubling its murmuring, arpeggiated guitars, while waves of Mellotron well up in the background of ""Ten-Year Librarian"". As you would expect from such an 80s-rooted album, there are rich bands of synthesizers here too, and they shimmer darkly from every corner of the mix. Taken as a whole (as it demands to be), <i>Catastrophist</i> is a rich, immersive experience, a bleak jewel of a record that takes obsession as its theme and rewards it in equal measure.</p></div>"|14020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14020-the-martyrdom-of-a-catastrophist/|7.5|Jayson Greene

But that's not the case with Tanlines, the duo of Jesse Cohen and Eric Emm, who arrive at their new project with pretty diverse backgrounds. Cohen comes from the dance-y post-punk act Professor Murder while Emm spent time in dissonant math-rock bands Don Caballero and Storm &amp; Stress, and interestingly Tanlines don't really sound like any of those groups. What they make now is tropical synth-pop that's more indebted to the Tough Alliance and, to some degree, <i>MPP</i>-era Animal Collective.</p>
<p>Tanlines are more production team than proper band and, not unlike Barcelona electro-poppers Delorean, their style is inspired as much by club music as indie rock. Straddling the line between dance and pop but hewing more towards the latter, Tanlines put together African percussion, swirling guitars, and dancefloor elements inside catchy, effervescent tracks. Their <i>Settings</i> EP comes on the heels of some early singles and remixes for groups such as Telepathe and finds the duo honing in on a fuller, more developed sound.</p>
<p>The record is split evenly between instrumental cuts and vocal tracks, and Tanlines do well with both. The appeal of these songs is primarily sonic (rich, surging arrangements and big clean hooks), so they don't all need words, but when Cohen and Emm do weave in lyrical content, it adds intrigue. The best example is standout ""Real Life"", where Emm gets wistful over knocking percussion and heaving, squeaky synths. ""You might think I'm still that way, it's only natural/ It was a past-life thing, it wasn't anything at all,"" he laments. If you've ever bumped into an ex who dumped you for doing something stupid, you know exactly what he's talking about.</p>
<p>Tanlines have a strong pop sensibility and a good working knowledge of global club sounds, and it's this balance that makes <i>Settings </i>an enjoyable listen. They're said to have an affinity for Depeche Mode (not so subtly hinted at here on ""Policy of Trust""), and while that may seem strange with music this sunny, you can hear pretty clearly in Tanlines' tracks their appreciation for hook-heavy dance-pop of all kinds. Not everything on the EP works as well as ""Real Life"" (they lose me a bit on the calypso and hip-hop informed ""Bees""), but mostly <i>Settings</i> functions as a punchy introduction to what these guys do well.</p></div>"|14031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14031-settings-ep/|7.6|Joe Colly

So it's curious that almost no one is doing more to boost San Francisco's ascendant art-pop scene. In the past six months alone, Woodsist has put out albums by the Fresh &amp; Onlys, Moon Duo, and the Art Museums. Of the three, the Art Museums-- comprised of Josh Alper (Whysp) and Glenn Donaldson (Skygreen Leopards)-- comes off as the most conventional. Passing on their peers' experimental tendencies, the duo enthusiastically professes the lo-fi indie pop religion of heroes Television Personalities and legendary labels like Sarah, Slumberland, K, and Flying Nun.</p>
<p>So the songs on their debut, <i>Rough Frame</i>, are catchy and concise and authentically coated with the gunk of a Tascam 388 tape machine. In fact, their primitive recording equipment is probably the best instrument in the duo's arsenal, which also includes rattling guitars and chintzy vintage synthesizers and drum machines. The Art Museums plead poverty and a desire for spontaneity, but you have to be pretty shrewd to sound this sloppy and this great. Album opener ""We Can't Handle It"" would be a fine pop song if you took a bar of soap to it. But its production debris gives it texture and substance, and the country mile that stretches between its Casio beats and muffled vocals lends the track a mystery that would probably otherwise elude it.</p>
<p>Lyrically, the release is just as hyper-conscious. <i>Rough Frame</i> stalks artist-wannabes in their natural habitats-- sculpture gardens and cinemas, rock clubs and hipster parties-- to subtly satiric effect. ""You took your bike to a nearby park/ Was it romantically charged?"" they tease on Guided by Voices-flavored ""Paris Cafés"". Meanwhile, the title track narrates a ""crisis of youth shot in 24 frames"" with beatific harmonies and a straight face. And ""Oh Modern Girls"" surveys the scene from the perplexed perspective of an older guy dating a younger girl: ""These animals in sweater vests/ DIY kids, standard test.""</p>
<p>It's obvious where the band's sympathies lie, but I doubt the Art Museums would exempt themselves from their own critique. Responding to a blogger's ""musical inspiration"" query, Donaldson offers up ""modernism, pop art, social commentary, and personal catharsis."" In case his bandmate's meaning isn't crystal clear, Alper adds, ""ecstatic absurdity and blissful reflection on imagined subcultural scenes and the tension of modern life."" Dudes may be calling bullshit on bohemian-like-me posturing, but they also understand their role in the racket. Fortunately, their tunes admit no such ambivalence: <i>Rough Frame</i> is a brief, brilliant set of infectious songs, and you can always ignore the lyrics if you want.</p></div>"|14025.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14025-rough-frame-ep/|7.9|Amy Granzin

Look at Fyfe Dangerfield. As lead singer for Guillemots, his swooping vocals helped lead the London four-piece to a Mercury Prize nomination for 2006's <i>Through the Windowpane</i>, a debut album overflowing with ideas and passion. Romantic grandeur and wide-eyed sincerity were part of Guillemots' early appeal, but that group's stylistic adventurousness and avant-garde impulses are all but gone on Dangerfield's solo debut, <i>Fly Yellow Moon</i>.</p>
<p>Instead we get syrupy sentimentality and drab earnestness. <i>Fly Yellow Moon</i> sticks to the modest, direct simplicity of classic 1970s singer-songwriter albums. Backed by piano, acoustic guitar, and in places orchestration that dimly recalls Guillemots' lushness, Dangerfield's voice still leaps tall buildings, while his words trade in schmaltzy clichés and his tunes too often fail to assert their own personality.</p>
<p>The problem definitely isn't a lack of feeling. The opening whoop of ""When You Walk in the Room"" sets the carefree, love-filled spirit nicely enough, and it's easy to believe Dangerfield when he sings, ""I can't help it if I'm happy."" Some of his former band's knack for atmosphere comes through occasionally, too. On the waltzing, acoustic ""High on the Tide"", children's chatter and seagull's squawks give a beach setting to Dangerfield's delicately voiced professions of happiness.</p>
<p><i>Fly Yellow Moon</i> just can't quite solve that old problem: how to be mushy but not mundane. Dangerfield wants ""to be near you all day"" on the ""Hallelujah""-ish ""Barricades"", to ""put my hands around your heart"" on the ""No Woman No Cry""-ish ""Livewire"", and to ""run circles around you"" on the ""Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon""-ish ""So Brand New"". ""Firebird"" finds him wanting to re-enact music hall staple ""Daisy Bell"". I'm sure it's all very well-meaning, but it's also saccharine and, in places, a little embarrassing. Before his next outing, let's hope Dangerfield remembers that even Stevie Wonder, that maestro of happy love songs, eventually did ""I Just Called to Say I Love You"".</p></div>"|14028.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14028-fly-yellow-moon/|4.7|Marc Hogan

No matter how flexible the definition has always been, they are not what you might call an ""indie rock"" band. It started with the five Philadelphians' first mpfree single last spring, ""Dream City"". The song is a distinctly American take on glam-boogie that immediately brings to mind teenage imagery: cruising around with friends late at night; inhaling bad beer way before you legally should; bottling the kind of wide-eyed, wild-haired feeling that galvanized Richard Linklater's <i>Dazed and Confused</i>. It has a huge, classic rock hook. It's frothy and light and waxed to a shine. It is both hopelessly hopeful and unabashedly corny. It is also really, really fun.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Stuck on Nothing</i>, their long-incubating debut full-length, doesn't hold back either. Produced by James Murphy (and released on DFA, his braintrust for New York dance/cool), it's stuffed with equally ham-fisted hooks and melodies, all of which hit their marks without apology or guile. The band (formerly members of the Pavement-worshipping St. Paul, Minn., outfit, Hockey Night) hooked up Murphy simply by sending him demos of all the songs here. Since then, he took them into the studio to flesh everything out. And flesh he did: from cowbell to strings to Hammond to sax, 1970s studio flourishes gussy up all corners of the recording. The guitar sounds are rich and creamy, the bass fat and warm. In a way, Murphy's production work here is such an integral part of the vibe, he comes off as a sixth member of the band. Everything pops, but the gloss never makes the songs here feel processed or too glossy. It simply fits them well.</p>
<p>And the songs are strong, too. From end-to-end, hooks come easy and freely. When the Les Pauls first bite down in opener ""Free Energy"", it's with purpose. What's most surprising about is how well the album stands on its own two legs, despite the fact that it feels like a rock'n'roll period piece. But if you dig deeper into the heavy of ""Bad Stuff"" or whir of ""Light Love"", you can get a sense of how and when these guys likely came across Thin Lizzy records. Namely, through rock touchstones of their youth, like Weezer's Blue Record or even Green Day's <i>Dookie</i> or Pearl Jam's <i>Ten</i>. In that regard, this is classic rock as interpreted by guys who heard those sounds second or third and not first.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Stuck on Nothing</i> feels like a healthy game of <i>Rock Band</i>, just without the console and TV around. Their devotion to the many clichés (see: karate kicks, drumstick twirls, the dueling guitars of highlight ""Hope Child"" and er, sleeveless tees) is about as firm as frontman Paul Sprangers is to hammering his lyrical M.O. home. He wants to wring the night of everything it's worth. He breezes through a few volumes' worth of conversational, inspirational poesy that's bound to send a few of you into fits of cringe. But, the fact that it's all delivered so un self-consciously is very refreshing. Much the same way kids shoot hoops pretending to be Michael or Kobe or LeBron, these dudes are doing the same with classic rock. And the posing and pastiche sound great.</p></div>"|14040.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14040-stuck-on-nothing/|8.1|David Bevan

When album opener ""Transparent"" starts, with a need for speed that trades paint with Deep Purple's ""Highway Star"", it seems like <i>Massa Hypnos</i> is just going to be business as usual. If only.</p>
<p>Nipping on the heels of ""Transparent"" is ""Flying"", which proves Awesome Color are equally adept at dispassionately ripping off indie rock.  With its effect-free, strummy guitars and singer/guitarist Derek Stanton doing his best Thurston Moore imitation, the group comes up with a <i>Dirty</i>-era outtake even Sonic Youth completists could live without.  It's a half-hearted attempt to diversify Awesome Color's already derivative portfolio, and it's sadly not the last on the album.</p>
<p>It's a shame, too, because when Awesome Color is cookin', and you can forgive their lyrical sins (and your copies of <i>Raw Power</i> and <i>Paranoid</i> aren't handy), they're a decent sludge-loving rock band.  If that seems like too many hoops to jump through, you're right, but hear me out. ""Oaxaca"" finds the group working an insidious shuffling groove to great effect. It not only acts as the perfect backdrop for a fuzzy psych'd-out guitar solo that fills the song's final third, but it also distracts from the tune's corny lyric about escaping New York City because ""Everyone's in a hurry/ And the noise is getting old."" Unfortunately, ""Vision"" is the only other tune on <i>Hypnos</i> that recalls the ""classic"" Awesome Color sound, and for every track on the album that highlights Awesome Color's limited strengths, there are plenty illustrating how limited those strengths actually are.</p>
<p>The most egregious is ""Zombie"", which finds Awesome Color all but asking for Alice Cooper to sue them.  Then again, I'm not sure Cooper would want to have anything to do with this ""I'm Eighteen"" knock-off's woe-is-society metaphor.  The less said about a shaggy blues groaner like ""Slaughterhouse"" (or, as Stanton sings it, ""slaaawter hawwwwss""), the better.  And as a reward for making it all the way through the album, there's the played-out freakout at the ass end of ""IOU"". The album's eight tracks total only 36 minutes, but <i>Massa Hypnos</i> seems twice as long, and wears out its welcome in a fraction of that time.  Back in 2006, writing about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9457-awesome-color/"">their eponymous debut</a>, Marc Masters suggested that ""it would be unfair to say Awesome Color won't eventually grow into something more unique."" Four years and two albums later, Awesome Color find themselves burning through reams of tracing paper, waiting for a growth spurt that might never come.</p></div>"|14030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14030-massa-hypnos/|3.8|David Raposa

Their 2006 debut, <i>Be He Me</i>, a timely mix of Animal Collective before they went electronic and Arcade Fire before they went morose, had them positioned to be an ideal test case for the starmaking ability of blogs. But bandleader Adam Baker and crew seemed just as excited and invested in their various electro side projects as they were in their meal ticket. It was hard not to jump to conclusions about focus when 2008's major-label <i>Such Fun</i> showed no interest whatsoever in upping the ante. Its title seemed like a weirdly deadpan admission of defeat.</p>
<p>So is the self-produced <i>Sweet Sister</i> EP just Annuals taking a hands-on approach out of necessity? In any case, they've cemented themselves as a rootsier Yeasayer, still endlessly curious about studio gadgetry and electronic composition but doing little to hide serious hopes of a H.O.R.D.E. tour revival. Just try to keep a running tally of every sonic doo-dad that pops up during the driving, Latin-tinged rhythm of ""Loxstep""-- is that a tabla hooked up to a wah-wah pedal or a jaw harp? Did they just put some Swizz Beatz turntable-scratch effect on Baker's voice? Check out all those bells and whirring synth lines! Their previous work was hardly minimalist, but their arrangements have become increasingly ostentatious in display of new toys. On the title track, bongos percolate and crystal-clear guitar peals evoke Mediterranean nylons, suggesting the word ""Balearic"" has been used on the Annuals tour bus. And then ""Holler and Howl"" does a Texas two-step immediately after, and it's hardly a harsh transition.</p>
<p>I still haven't mentioned the melodies or lyrics yet, which underscores what made <i>Such Fun</i> such a worrying listen. The band's debut stood out more for its youthful exuberance-- embarrassingly/memorably portrayed as ""magic coming out my ass""-- than any of its songwriting substance. And youthful exuberance isn't exactly a renewable resource. Baker has all but abandoned <i>Be He Me</i>'s unhinged yelping, favoring a more plaintive EveryIndieDude tone that suits the dusky atmosphere of ""Turncloaking"" but doesn't offer much that sticks. Likewise, the lyrics rarely stand out except for the occasional hippy-dippy homily: ""I can't get high, but I can get lost,"" ""Love is what keeps you kind,"" things like that.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be a surprise that ""Flesh &amp; Blood"", a song not written by Annuals, is by a wide margin the most memorable song here. The light countrypolitan glaze laid on the Johnny Cash song indicates that Annuals take neither themselves nor their source material too seriously. But the lyrics' yearning for something tangible and substantial ultimately feels at odds with what <i>Sweet Sister</i>, promising surface and all, actually brings to the table.</p></div>"|14004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14004-sweet-sister-ep/|5.6|Ian Cohen

It was an album content to play well within a defined set of parameters and found them tinkering with rockabilly, 1960s R&amp;B, and British Invasion rock. It's easy to imagine the Strange Boys could churn out sets of these half-drunk shakers forever, and considering how well they did pull it off, that seemed like something to look forward to.</p>
<p>But follow-up album <i>Be Brave</i> isn't <i>Girls Club II</i>. It's far less boisterous, unafraid to slow things down and let the band stretch out a little. Though still alive with rambling charm, loneliness hangs over much of album, nurturing a more introspective feel. ""Life changed on you again,"" frontman Ryan Sambol mentions at the beginning of ""A Walk on the Bleach"", in his unmistakable early Dylan yowl. And indeed, something seems to have changed for the Strange Boys, as they no longer have a need to get their Ya-Yas out on every track. <i>Be Brave</i> is a cleaner, more mature look, peppered with feelings of unease and imparting a greater focus on country, blues, and a little balladeering.</p>
<p>Most of <i>Be Brave</i> is marked by mid-tempo numbers that give the band a little space to play around with rootsier incarnations that favor bits of organ, piano, and plenty of twangy guitar. The jauntier songs tend to have a woozy, communal appeal, like opener ""I See"" or the saloon-piano accented ""Da Da"". Fans of <i>Girls Club</i> will find joy in the title track, a thrilling little slice of twist-inducing primal R&amp;B (augmented by a warped sax break, courtesy of the now-disbanded Mika Miko's Jenna Thornhill). But the majority of the album takes on a different shape, taking great care to show some restraint even when it seems unnatural.</p>
<p>The Strange Boys have proved to be great attention-grabbers but seem a little lost when things get too quiet. The three acoustic ballads that round out the album are a little dull, and the Boys' cautious pacing doesn't always hold up to close listening. A lot of these moments leave you feeling antsy, with hope that another one of their deranged sock-hop jams might be lurking somewhere around the corner. But the key to <i>Be Brave</i> is allowing the band to dig around, and the rewards-- while occasionally a little slow in coming-- reveal that the Strange Boys can offer more than just a quick fix. For a band formerly so brash and unhinged, it's a bold look in its own way.</p></div>"|14005.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14005-be-brave/|6.6|Zach Kelly

From Weezer to At the Drive-In, Fugazi, the Presidents of the United States of America to Sonic Youth, the index makes clear this band bashes out anthems that recall post-punk and alternative rock heroes. No, it's not exactly original stuff, but, at their best, Double Dagger feel fresh and urgent. Each song is like another alarm clock ringing.</p>
<p>That makes ""Imitation is the Most Boring Form of Flattery"", <i>Masks</i>' opening shot, the perfect gambit. Like a thick shot of <i>Red Medicine</i>, Double Dagger rises into a scrim of noise. ""Look out, kids! We're all in danger. Our history has no future. Don't be just another repeater. Our history has no future,"" singer Nolen Strals and bassist Bruce Willen shout together, offering the hook as a preamble. Strals rails against those who simply offer pale versions of old records for an easy ride into mass consumption. But Strals questions himself here, too, especially given that list of inspirations: ""You don't see the past as a source of inspiration/ You just have it sat at your final destination."" At first, I misheard this lyric, so that it felt as if he were contemplating his own guilt, allowing for interpretation: Is it that when you accept your influences at face value, you die, or is it that you haven't reached creative fulfillment until you acknowledge that art is bigger than your own ideas? But given the list of comparisons the band recognizes, it works more as a credo-- never be satisfied with sounding too much like anyone. If you do, beware: ""I guess how it went is just how it goes,"" he recapitulates, shrugging it off and barreling ahead.</p>
<p>Despite its instrumental ferocity and sharpened focus, Double Dagger never take themselves too seriously, eschewing some of the proselytizing of their previous albums. The EP is both hilarious and furious, poking fun to prove bigger points. On ""Pillow Talk"", for instance, Strals relates half a dozen ribald tales of sexual deviance-- the woman who wants to suck on her friend's stinky feet; the man who thinks his way through sex with his girlfriend so he doesn't cry out ""Bob""; the guy who hopes to be bound but fears what his partner will think when he brings the rope into the bedroom. But Strals isn't out for laughs. ""If I could leave you with one bit of advice,"" he says, ""whisper in their ear how you want it tonight."" Likewise, ""Sheep in Wolf's Clothing"" revels in the sort of linguistic back flips its title suggest, stringing a handful of good-for-nothing catch phrases together. Even the seven-minute ""Sleeping with the TV On"", which tackles unfaithful friends, high taxes, health insurance, raised rent, and generally bad situations, is a love song of sorts. With all the reasons in the world to be nervous, or to sleep beside the adult nightlight of a Lifetime rerun, he'd like a little comfort and companionship. At least until the next alarm clock rings.</p></div>"|14026.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14026-masks-ep/|8.1|Grayson Currin

Case in point: the Morning Benders' 2008 debut, <i>Talking Through Tin Cans</i>, a collection of boilerplate indie rock that borrowed more than a bit from the Shins' jangle pop. Despite a few bright spots, the record branded the San Franciscan outfit with a second-tier reputation.  Add that to the fact that the Shins aren't groundbreakers themselves, and <i>Talking Through Tin Cans</i> begins to sound as limited as the rudimentary children's activity suggested in its title.</p>
<p>The title to the Benders' sophomore effort and Rough Trade debut, <i>Big Echo</i>, appropriately evokes their sonic shift in the past two years. The album is a homecoming of sorts, as it finds the Morning Benders correcting their PacNW indie pop identity crisis in favor of a more coastal, kaleidoscopic California haze. It also finds them embracing the cavernous experimental rock sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear""></a>Grizzly Bear, whose Chris Taylor shares a co-production credit with Benders singer/guitarist Christopher Chu.</p>
<p><i>Big Echo</i> kicks off with ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11788-excuses""></a>Excuses"", a sunny, lilting little ditty that carries simultaneous debts to 1950s pop balladry and <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i>-inspired orchestral mania. The song is an easygoing and excellent introduction to the Benders' stylistic changes, and its charming melody serves as an adequate explanation as to how these guys got so many San Franciscan music notables into one room to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/episode/2115-the-morning-benders/1"">perform the tune</a> for videographers Yours Truly.</p>
<p>The trio that follow ""Excuses"" round out <i>Big Echo</i>'s more accessible front-end and come closest to the Benders' previous, less complicated sound. Even then, the band finds ways to add touches of weirdness to each track. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11756-promises""></a>Promises"" may be just another song about an uncertain relationship, but the song's big-beat thump and tangled voices add something sticky to the bittersweet presentation. The simple shuffle of ""Wet Cement"" is augmented by scale-sliding background vocals, while the economical ""Cold War (Nice Clean Fight)"" features glockenspiel to accentuate its ramshackle charm.</p>
<p><i>Big Echo</i>'s second half is slightly slower and swampier than its first; it's also where the band's newfound Grizzly Bear influence comes through clearest, from the jagged guitars that crack open ""Hand Me Downs"" to the breathy, multi-part swooning of ""Pleasure Sighs"" and ""Stitches"". Taylor's studio presence is all over <i>Big Echo</i>, from the warped music-hall strings of ""Excuses"" to the hymn-like, soft-focus vocals on album closer ""Sleeping In"". This cavernous production gives <i>Big Echo</i> another titular double-meaning, lending gravitas and providing guitarists Christopher and Jonathan Chu room to stretch amidst the wooly arrangements.</p>
<p>Giving too much credit to Taylor's influence and direction, however, undermines the Morning Benders' stylistic transition, one any band would envy and many listeners will love. Many bands spend entire careers trying (and failing) to even nail down the one thing they're good at. The Morning Benders have already found a handful. Here's hoping they continue down the path illustrated on <i>Big Echo</i>'s gorgeous oil-painted album cover: into the unsure seas, and away from the relative safety of stable terrain.</p></div>"|13965.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13965-big-echo/|8.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

Freelance Whales' Jacob Hyman' addition to this legacy is... incorporating a watering can into his kit. I wouldn't bring this up if everyone else didn't-- it's the most oft-repeated factoid regarding Freelance Whales in all of their pre-release hype. But I'll be damned if I could pinpoint that watering can on record. It's basically a cutesy affectation without actual purpose, which isn't a bad metaphor for the band itself.</p>
<p>Freelance Whales are gaining attention for good reason. Besides being on Frenchkiss, a label with a great recent track record of locating bands with quality plus commercial appeal (Passion Pit, the Antlers, Dodos, Local Natives), FW sound on the surface a lot like 00s Indie Hall of Famers Arcade Fire, Ben Gibbard, and Sufjan Stevens. Freelance Whales have plenty of band-camp orchestrations, complete-sentence lyrics, and banjo; but their predecessors' work was so resonant because it felt birthed out of necessity and populated with real people and relatable emotion. Here, everything is based in stunted adolescence and rote ideas-- you almost wonder if they think storks bring babies to this world.</p>
<p>The cloying overload starts with ""Hannah"", wherein frontman Judah Dadone empties a vault of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Pixie_Dream_Girl"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Manic Pixie Dream Girl</a> clichés-- martinis, balconies, chance encounters on spiral stairs. He also unveils an early contender for the most eye-gouging lyrical run of 2010: ""Every now and again she offers me a lemon Now &amp; Later/ Please don't play the matchmaker/ Please don't be a player hater/ If you dig her recent work/ You should go congratulate her."" They should've just been up front and titled this song ""Zooey"".</p>
<p>Most of <i>Weathervanes </i> is serviceable modern rock, so it will find an appreciative audience despite its egregious derivativeness and a lyricist who seems like he'd use the word ""inebriated"" to talk about how drunk he got last night. ""Kilojoules"" fascinates itself with bodily function in a manner similar to Death Cab's ""Tiny Vessels"" or ""We Looked Like Giants"", but while Gibbard's lyrics were awkward in a vitally hormonal way, Dadone's are awkward merely as a result of bad poetry: ""You liken me to a vampire/ My left hand was wearing fake plastic teeth all winter."" ""Ghosting"" doesn't trust the understated delicacy of its acoustic motif enough to convey beauty, so it dumped an entire Christmas' worth of bells and choirs over stilted nostalgia.</p>
<p>Freelance Whales are a far cry from the unforgivable Owl City, but it's kind of amazing this <i>Nick &amp; Norah</i>-core is both surviving and thriving. At this rate Death Cab are staking out Pearl Jam status in the 2010s, i.e., a band that gave many astute listeners an entry to more outré sounds but ultimately became reviled for the shitty music they, through no fault of their own, inspired. Now that the Etsy set's poet laureate has married its prom queen, you wonder if guys like Freelance Whales are trying to draw a wedge between Gibbard and Deschanel by somehow sullying both of their work. As a document of high-concept revenge, <i>Weathervanes </i>is actually kind of fascinating. Alas, that's likely not to be the case, and as just plain music it's not very fascinating at all.</p></div>"|13955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13955-weathervanes/|4.2|Ian Cohen

In late 2008, the Vermont native, who also writes and records on his own as King Tuff, had some new songs to share. He was too scared to play them out alone, so for one show he threw together a band with Chris Weisman on bass and Ruth Garbus (sister of tUnE-yArDs' Merrill Garbus) on drums. It went over pretty well. They decided to keep playing together, and four gigs later, Sub Pop snapped the trio up. Thomas' songs can take your breath away that easily.</p>
<p>As King Tuff, he developed a committed DIY following by sticking close to the textures of 70s power pop and glam-- T. Rex and Flamin' Groovies are two handy reference points. As Happy Birthday, Thomas and his bandmates still hang out with those sounds some, but they've also combined to make a two-faced blend of twee and grunge, a pretty natural fit for their label. Aesthetically and sonically, few other subgenres could be further away from one another, but the meet-up is a great idea executed really well. Thomas glues the pretty (Garbus' vocals) and ugly (his own screeching, see also: his work singing in Witch) together with fantastic melodies, at times so plentiful they bury one another. He also has a tendency to vocalize his guitar melodies, an effect that makes for heavy layering, burying some of his best hooks. (In opener ""Girls FM"", a haymaker single that's already been making the web rounds, listen closely to how Thomas' guitar twists during its runs through the coda.)</p>
<p>But the songs that bulldoze you grant all of their moving parts a similar amount of space. ""2 Shy"" is a clinic in vocal harmonizing, and ""Pink Strawberry Shake"" is the kind of AM gold David Vandervelde's been going in circles searching for recently. Lyrically, however, Thomas spends a lot of time indoors, framing himself as an acne-splotched teen who enjoys no successes communicating with or courting the opposite sex. And without question, the sly romance of ""Subliminal Message"" is the crown jam here: four minutes of sugar featuring a behemoth, synth-hinged chorus that he should share with that girl ASAP.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday falter only when Thomas chooses to burp all over a song when he should just let breathe. On ""Perverted Girl"", he forgoes a bridge by wrenching some sore-throated wails and racket in there instead. Or maybe it's a bridge. That short blast of scuzz and scream works perfectly within the bratty punk of ""Zit"", Thomas' refrain, ""Now I wanna break shit/ Don't want to make shit/ Just want to waste it""-- a pretty funny line coming from a dude who's rumored to have stockpiled huge numbers of songs in his room. He should definitely keep them coming.</p></div>"|14042.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14042-happy-birthday/|7.8|David Bevan

Sometimes, people play music because they want to belong to a community. And once in a while, community-driven sounds intersect with a historic and political moment, and music takes on special significance.</p>
<p>Such was the case with the Tribe, a creative collective founded in Detroit in 1972 by trombonist Phil Ranelin and reed player Wendell Harrison and whose media arm included a label and quarterly magazine. The Tribe was born out of the African-American consciousness of the Civil Rights era, and its mission was to further the cause of black empowerment. Its magazine featured news and editorials on the issues of the day-- busing, government corruption, the dimming economic climate-- alongside discussion of music. The label issued the work of area musicians, some of whom made a living as session players for Motown (the company left Detroit for L.A. the year Tribe was founded) while simultaneously pursuing jazz. Everything about the Tribe was local, intent on reflecting and documenting the surrounding community. There was a lot of uncertainty in Detroit in the early 1970s-- the auto industry was declining, parts of the city had been destroyed during riots in the late 60s, and population was in the early stages of a long, dramatic decline. The Tribe was a group of people banding together, trying so sort through it all as it happened.</p>
<p><i>Message From the Tribe</i>, originally issued in 1996 and now re-issued by Soul Jazz's Universal Sound imprint with new packaging, gives an overview of Tribe's output during its five-year run. The music is most striking for its eclectic, without-borders approach: though ""jazz"" is an appropriate catchall term and the music feels of a piece, the individual tracks defy easy categorization. In the notes, comparisons are drawn between the Tribe's mission and that of Chicago's Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, but the music here is comparatively accessible, with a steady, danceable pulse, and it never veers into avant-garde abstraction. Ranelin, represented as a leader on three of the comp's 12 tracks, plays jazz, but he was ultimately re-discovered
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
by the rare groove set, which gives an idea of his dedication to hypnotic rhythm. While his ""Vibes From the Tribe"" combines the ethereal harmonic drift of Miles Davis circa <i>Nefertiti </i>with the bass-driven grooves concurrently being explored by Herbie Hancock, ""For the Children"", though certainly still jazz, finds him singing as well as soloing on trombone. The music billed to the Tribe-- basically an all-star band drawn from members of the collective, including Ranelin and Harrison-- ranges from the nimble funk blowing session ""Beneficent"" to the politicized message of hope ""What We Need"", with vocals by Jeamel Lee. Another vocal cut, Doug Hammond's ""Moves"", is a strange and haunting ballad featuring  Hammond's earthy voice trading melodic lines with violin, Fender  Rhodes, and Moog.</p>
<p>The music from <i>Message From the Tribe </i>is strong, a great set of open-minded and accessible jazz from an exciting time in the music's history. But the full impact of the package, which includes a 60-page booklet featuring reprints from the magazine along with postcards containing additional covers from the publication, provides depth. Looking through the essays and news alongside the advertisements for black-owned businesses, the music's context as the center of a community becomes clear. There's an article by a student from Wayne State University on Watergate, a piece outlining the basics of the then-current recession, and a feature on Jesse Jackson's burgeoning Operation PUSH. There are also music reviews and interviews. In <i>Tribe</i>-- ""Detroit's First Magazine for Black Awareness"" was the subtitle-- the lines between politics, activism, art, and entertainment are not just unclear: No one seemed to see any reason to draw them in the first place. When you spend so much time enjoying the easy benefits of commitment-free consumption, it's easy to forget about such possibilities.</p></div>"|14046.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14046-message-from-the-tribe-an-anthology-of-tribe-records-1972-1976/|8.2|Mark Richardson

The glitchy electronics of Kosemura's prior work are gone. The music is so hushed you can hear the action of the pedals, the keyboard shifting in the body of the piano. This quiet rumpus serves as a relaxed rhythm track-- one suspects Kosemura mic'd the piano to capture these extraneous sounds, drawing them purposefully into the music. The gesture is Cagean, but the questioning, wonder-filled style is pure Satie. The cover art captures the mood perfectly, although a blue sky filled with kites and balloons would have been just as apt.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Music described approvingly as ""childlike"" strives for a rich, timeless simplicity that makes us forget about the constructed world we worry over. <i>Polaroid Piano</i> is stuffed with this feeling, not to mention some more blatant signifiers. A toy xylophone plinks through the sustained piano and softly rubbed acoustic guitar strings of ""Higari"". <span> </span>On ""Sign"", birdsong twitters above the tentative piano phrases, while the faint sound of acoustic guitar ripples forward and backward. On ""Tale"", Kosemura cuts to the chase with a field recording of children playing over xylophone and sleigh bells. Bound to be the most divisive moment on the record, ""Tale"" will make your eyes either roll or tear up.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">A few pieces break <i>Polaroid Piano</i>'s mold in careful ways. On ""Tyme"", the busiest piece here, the greater speed and density of the notes makes the clunks and creaks of the piano sound like an old copy machine. On ""Guitar"", guitar and piano notes blur amid crackling, fiery sounds and lightly scratched strings. And closer ""Venice"", the album's longest piece, is contrastingly liquid, with piano swirling against the lulling sound of water flowing calmly. Because it's so transient and mild-- 10 pieces flow by in less than half an hour-- the album, paradoxically, expands with multiple listens. It feels impossible to get tired of, circumscribed and boundless at once, and it's so subtle that you might let it spin two or three times before you start to notice the repetition.</p></div>"|13980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13980-polaroid-piano/|7.9|Brian Howe

As the band matured and its <i>de facto</i> frontman Patterson Hood started writing songs that were weightier and more universal in sentiment, however, its more darkly off-kilter early work came to be generally viewed as juvenilia, the dicking around these guys did before they grew up into real artists. That would be a mistake, because songs like ""18 Wheels of Love"", ""Bulldozers and Dirt"", and ""Zoloft"" were wickedly clever and deeply revealing slices of Southern life that hold relatable truths for all listeners regardless of region. That said, it's a refreshing surprise that the group's latest album, <i>The Big To-Do,</i> finds Hood reconnecting with the macabre, with grim twists and booze-fueled mayhem, and with the dark corners of the American psyche.</p>
<p>The album begins morbidly with ""Daddy Learned to Fly"", its whining riff propelling the first-person reflections of a young boy whose father has died. It's a colorful kind of morbidity, however, as we learn the boy has been eased into an acceptance of loss by the creative lie that his father is perpetually flying the friendly skies. Weighing the most deadly serious facts of life against a highly skewed sense of irreverence has always been one of DBT's greatest feats, and it's a balancing act the group maintains throughout the album's raucous first half-- on the booze-fueled bottoming-out of ""Fourth Night of My Drinking"", the small-town sex scandal of the portentously delivered ""The Wig He Made Her Wear"", and the nasty little slice of backwater intrigue called ""Drag the Lake Charlie"".</p>
<p>It's a damn good thing Hood drops some of his gravitas, too, because his partner in crime, Mike Cooley (aka the Trucker you've always been able to rely on for witty shit-kickers) inexplicably contributes only three songs out of <i>The Big To-Do</i>'s 13. Two of the three are great, as ""Birthday Boy"" offers up the musings of a savvy stripper while ""Get Downtown"" provides a shaggy snapshot of no-account losers outfitted to a shucking Chuck Berry groove. Still, that leaves quite a heavy burden on Hood's shoulders, even after you account for a couple of very nice turns from bassist Shonna Tucker, who was a bit of a weak link on <i>Creation's Dark</i> but who chills the blood here on the heartrending, hymnlike ""You Got Another"", then sets it racing again on the full-throated ""(It's Gonna Be) I Told You So"".</p>
<p>To his credit, Hood's restored mischievousness manages to carry the album for quite some time, but he starts to falter along the record's back stretch. ""This Fucking Job"" and ""After the Scene Dies"" are sonically torqued-up and admirably pissed-off, but their respective gripes against occupational drudgery and the death of the rock'n'roll dream represent well-trodden ground for this songwriter. <i>The Big To-Do</i> then proceeds to bow out rather unceremoniously with the relative whimpers of ""Santa Fe"", ""The Flying Wallendas"", and Cooley's sweet but tepid ""Eyes Like Glue"". The Truckers demonstrated with 2008's <i>Brighter Than</i> <i>Creation's Dark</i> that they don't need non-stop yuks and grotesqueries to reach greatness, but the best moments of <i>The Big To-Do</i> nonetheless offer tantalizing proof that these guys still possess fascinatingly warped minds when they feel like showing 'em off.</p></div>"|13993.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13993-the-big-to-do/|7.4|Joshua Love

The Besnard Lakes may have been a (mostly) unknown quantity when they broke out to a wider audience in 2007, but they were also insiders of sorts-- guitarist/vocalist Jace Lasek had done production work with Montreal heavyweights Wolf Parade and Sunset Rubdown. Fitting of its title, <i>Are the Dark Horse</i> had a subtle, almost shy, quality-- on many songs, the group's quiet side slowly swelled into a symphony. On the follow-up, <i>Are the Roaring Night</i>, husband-and-wife duo Lasek and Olga Goreas map out a sonic landscape that follows the peaks and valleys of their previous work, but the terrain is more ragged.</p>
<p>New songs like ""Glass Printer"" sound more electrified and easily triggered from the outset. Marching forward with the inexorable, unforgiving pace the title implies, ""And This Is What We Call Progress"" pairs a steely two-drum pulse with a line of static suspended by an EBow. Even the slow, pretty interludes often exude more tension than the suspended-in-space, Spiritualized vibe of an older song like ""For Agent 13"". There's more unease in the band's bold space rock-- vocal harmonies mask that sense of menace on the two-part ""Like the Ocean, Like the Innocent"", which opens the album with oscillating notes and fluctuating guitar. After trading cloying choruses with Goreas, Lasek sings, ""Deciphered your lines from the short wave/ It said 'Kill all the swine, young and old.'"" Darkness and destruction are also central to ""Land of Living Skies"", made even more poignant after an opening segment of sinister radio transmissions.</p>
<p>Talk of scrambled signals and short-wave technology is fitting considering Lasek's production background (check out the <a href=""http://www.breakglass.ca/breakglass%20studios%20Equipment%20list.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">online gear list</a> for his Breakglass studio). An impressive array of crunchy guitar tones courses throughout the album, pushing forward two-part epics so the steady cycle of build and release doesn't become overwrought. Craftsmanship permeates the peels of reverb-laden melodies or the <i>Loveless</i>-like<i> </i>gyre of lead single ""Albatross"". <i>Are the Roaring Night</i> sounds richer, and while it doesn't rewrite the formula, it contains many small refinements to the band's songwriting and production skills. Outside of the twinkling, sub-orbital synths on the closer ""The Lonely Moan"", there isn't anything that would be considered a radical departure. But when you make the kind of entrance the Besnard Lakes did, there isn't much to fix.</p></div>"|13973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13973-are-the-roaring-night/|7.8|Patrick Sisson

But ever since Ondi Timoner's notorious 2004 documentary <i>Dig!</i> cast his erratic, sometimes violent personality in a most unflattering lens, he's seemed less willing to put himself front and center in his own music. He deferred most of the vocal duties on 2005's <i>We Are the Radio</i> to guest singer Sarabeth Tucek and spent the duration of 2008's nigh impenetrable <i>My Bloody Underground</i> submerged in a lo-fi murk. On first approach, <i>Who Killed Sgt. Pepper?</i> continues the subterfuge-- like its predecessor, the new album boasts cassette-quality fidelity, features revolving-door collaborations with various European comrades, and carves another couple pounds of brisket off the sacred cow that is the Beatles. But in sharp contrast to <i>My Bloody Underground</i>'s stoned lethargy, <i>Who Killed Sgt. Pepper</i>? represents a genuine attempt on Newcombe's part to revitalize his band's sound. It's the Brian Jonestown Massacre album that's the least informed by the usual parade of 1960s mod/psych influences, opting instead for flirtations with disco rhythms, drum loops, boom-box beats and house-diva wails.</p>
<p>In a sense, Newcombe has simply replaced one form of repetition (droning/jangly guitar jams) for another (dance workouts). Once locked into a groove, he's not always sure what to do with it, letting Hacienda flashbacks like ""This Is the First of Your Last Warning (Icelandic)"" and ""Feel It"" chug along unnecessarily past the six-minute mark without introducing much variation on their pre-established themes. And in ""Let's Go Fucking Mental"", we find two brutish British traditions-- soccer chants and late-90s Big-Beat electronica-- combined into a laborious, lunk-head stomp that pummels enough brain cells to fulfill its own prophecy.</p>
<p>Newcombe's beat experiments produce greater results when he uses them to draw out his songs' underlying menace. Compared to the steady 4/4 pulse of the aforementioned tracks, ""This Is the One Thing We Did Not Want to Have Happen"" provides a welcome mid-album jolt, with Newcombe's threatening vocal spurred on by a torrent of squalling guitars and a corrosive ""She's Lost Control"" rhythm loop (presumably a cheeky response to Bernard Sumner's band Bad Lieutenant nicking the riff to the Brian Jonestown Massacre's ""When Jokers Attack"" on their 2009 single ""Sink or Swim""). ""Someplace Else Unknown"" gets even more unhinged, with a ticking-time-bomb beat and queasy background textures that coax a strung-out Newcombe to maniacally scream, ""Look motherfucker, now I'm looking for drugs!"" Newcombe may be sober these days, but this track provides the most convincing recorded evidence in the entire BJM catalogue of the volatile character we see in <i>Dig!.</i></p>
<p>As if to underscore his distance from the smack-habit days that ""Someplace Else Unknown"" revisits, Newcombe's mood brightens considerably in the home stretch, offering up a pair of peace-offering pop songs that hearken back to the band's shoegazered 1995 debut <i>Methodrone</i>, and the delightfully WTF curio that is ""Dekta! Dekta! Dekta!"", a jaunty new-wave jig that's of a piece with early-80s Euro-pop novelties like Trio's ""Da Da Da"" and Falco's ""Der Kommissar"". But, of course, Newcombe can't let things lie without one last gratuitous exercise in kill-your-idols provocation, in this case the 10-minute sound-collage closer ""Felt Tipped Pictures of UFOs"". Juxtaposing John Lennon's infamous ""bigger than Jesus"" apology speech with the rantings of a young, impoverished Scottish woman calling bullshit on his ""imagine no possessions"" rhetoric, the track initially serves to encapsulate the philosophical disconnect between rich pop stars and the common fan. But as Newcombe lets the woman spout off on the details of a John Lennon-séance reality-TV special for the last five minutes, you start to wonder which musician's self-indulgence is really the issue here.</p></div>"|14009.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14009-who-killed-sgt-pepper/|5.7|Stuart Berman

Their music features abstract vocals, electronics, and a sense of practiced spontaneity. But in fact, their focus is on musicianship, not innovation. <i>Wildling</i> is built from familiar units-- the patient development of jazz, the spacey glide of classic German psychedelia (think Cluster), and a bendy guitar style familiar from spaghetti Westerns scored by Ennio Morricone. With just a tinge of indie-rock melodicism and art-rock posture, KK bind these familiar touchstones into a striking personal sound.</p>
<p>This is cerebral, subtle music. There are few obvious climaxes. The conglomerated style feels balanced, because everyone plays their role sensitively. Double bassist Johannes Frisch provides a rock-solid jazz foundation for the movements, shifting between deep grooves and deft extemporization. Guitarist Thomas Weber provides a lot of the 1970s experimental and cinematic feel, simultaneously handling woozy but hard-flecked guitars and electronic textures. Heike Aumüller provides the personality and humanizing voice, either sitting at her harmonium, or hunkering down on the floor with a flute or synthesizer. Drummer Christopher Brunner is adroit and feather-light. No one ever flies off on their own trip; all play tactfully and with a sense of the overriding structure.</p>
<p>The scary mannequin-creature from the cover of 2007's <i>Jinx</i> makes a return appearance here, now with its dress pulled down ominously. Fans of that record will find themselves right at home, as KK has always stressed gradual refinement over sudden left turns: The music is mannered, restrained, redolent of 70s exotica; the vocals are cool and remote but essentially passionate. Aumüller coos like an out-music ice-diva amid the slow bluster of ""Move Right In"" as the guitar bends like cold starlight around the thumping double bass. ""I feel lightheaded,"" she sings on ""Aum A-Go-Go"", against a backdrop of xylophone and metallically textured ringlets. But you'd never guess it from her utterly composed delivery, which sounds low-key even when chopped into a blur during the song's conclusion. She sings in a weird, sometimes incomprehensible English that conveys just fine-- you can tell that ""Spookin' the Horse"" is a love song, just from how the voice plays against the big swoony guitar chords. Regardless of whether it sounds like melted indie rock or coiling jazz, each song has a mysterious, soulful pulse to follow, always just out of reach. The record eschews highs and lows for a steady, seductive purr.</p>
<p>To their credit, Kammerflimmer Kollektief get a long way into the record before their regimented style begins to show signs of wear. Former collaborator Dietrich Foth lends the welcome new timbre of his saxophone to ""Silver Chords"" and ""Spookin' the Horse"". ""In Transition (Version)"" is an epic, shivering dub, and ""Rotwelsch"" has an archly medieval feel, like Mary Timony gone jazz. While there are some nice numbers tucked away near the end-- the dubby ""Cry Tuff"", and ""We Paint the Town Beige"", whose chord progression and vocal melody obliquely but strongly suggest ""Karma Police""-- the monolithic guitar tone begins to impose a kind of sameness. The music eventually gets so deep into the lizard brain that it nearly vanishes. But for fans of controlled musicianship and mysterious mood, this is a very nice surprise.</p></div>"|13986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13986-wildling/|7.0|Brian Howe

Perhaps you know him from his keyboard and vocal duties in Oakland's garishly theatrical, ambisexual band Gravy Train!!!!. Or perhaps you recognize him from his very naked appearance in the ""hardcore"" version of his labelmates Girls' ""Lust For Life"" video. Or maybe you're one of the fans that have been trolling eBay for the five hard-to-find, sold-out Hunx and His Punx singles that have been released (and just as quickly snapped up) over the past two years.</p>
<p>If you count yourself in the latter category, then you're in luck; this album collects the tunes from those 7”s, presenting them (along with new bonus track ""Do the Make Up"") together for the first time. If you count yourself in the first category, however, you may be quite surprised by <i>Gay Singles</i>. There are no cartoonish synthesizer melodies, cheap Casio beats, or party-starting cacophonies of cowbell. There's no tongue-in-cheek rapping, either. Yes, the content is still overtly sexual, but it is softer and sweeter-- both lyrically and musically-- than anything you'd expect from a Gravy Train!!!! member.</p>
<p>Hunx and His Punx make swooning bubblegum-punk, and though they aren't the first group to marry the effortless, sugary pop of 60s girl groups with the garage-rock revival, they might be the first whose skuzzy ""My Boyfriend's Back""-like songs are explicitly homoerotic. There is a wry dissonance between the songs' easy three-chord strums, resonant vintage organ flourishes, and hand-clapped percussion and their plainspoken lyrics about getting into someone's pants. The songwriters (most tracks are credited to a combination of Bogart and Justin Champlin, the garage-punk character known as Nobunny) may think they're being shocking, but the lyrics are actually charmingly innocent. While Gravy Train!!!! sing explicitly raunchy lyrics about masturbation, lap dances, and hand jobs, Hunx are more interested in winning over straight guys (""I don't think he's gonna miss her/ Cuz I'm a really good kisser,"" Bogart sings on ""Good Kisser""), and flipping 60s girl-pop tropes like waiting for boys to call.</p>
<p>The outrageously tarty presentation plus faux naïve musical content highlights a winning group of influences-- John Waters, the Shangri-Las, the Ramones-- and the collection is surprisingly cohesive for a singles compilation. Bogart sings with a whining, nasal bray that may be off-putting or gratingly flat to some, but swathed in cheap, tinny reverb, it gets the rebellious, adolescent vibe right. After all the homoeroticism, this is at heart a record about the thrust and vitality of rock'n'roll: ""You like Morrissey, you like U2/ What the fuck is wrong with you?"" Bogart sings on opener ""You Don't Like Rock'n'Roll"", and if you think it's a legit question you might want to sing it along with him.</p></div>"|14015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14015-gay-singles/|7.3|Rebecca Raber

So it's appropriate that the band's website features a video of them jamming out with kindergartners and another with Andrew WK-- people so caught up in having a good time that you sometimes wonder if they're bullshitting you. What helps Fang Island<i> </i>steamroll past cynicism is how ""fun"" isn't just an ornament for them, it's<span> </span>embedded in the band's musical DNA<span>. </span></p>
<p><span>Fang Island's self-titled</span> second album is joyous despite its general lack of verses or choruses. It's fractured like any post-punk record while also speaking the language of classic rock, yet often feels like an intricate collage pieced together from elements that make songs memorable-- palm-muted power chords following wide-open intros, blistering solos, double-time outros.<span> </span>Pretty much all of that is crammed into the deleriously infectious ""Daisy"", an emphatic crossbreed of the Go! Team and the Promise Ring's ""Is This  Thing On?"" The dance routine in the song's video feels like the only natural reaction to hearing it.</p>
<p>As <i>Fang</i><i> Island</i>'s entry point, ""Daisy"" might come on a bit strong, but what precedes it sets the tone perfectly. The record opens with fireworks<span> (literally), before an armada of severely EQ'd guitar harmonics swoop in like fighter jets. The band then bursts into a dense chorus of four-part harmonies, earnestly intoning the WK-ish positive mantra: ""They are all within my reach. They are free.""</span> Next comes ""Careful Crossers"", which has no words but would be shortchanged by being called an ""instrumental"" when such lyrical riffs pop up every eight bars.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Fang Island aren't total deconstructionists-- the see-sawing rhythms and stutter-step cadence of songs like ""Life Coach"" and ""Treeton"" wouldn't be out of place on a Spoon or Modest Mouse album. But unlike other pop craftsmen, Fang Island rarely give you any indication of what direction they might take.<span> </span>""Sideswiper"" appears to settle into a Ted Leo-ish 12/8 stomper after its darting intro, until a sudden acoustic guitar and high-wire leads hints that the whole thing might just be one big riff on ""Jack and Diane"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The music coordinators at MTV recently tapped ""Daisy"" to soundtrack a series of commercials for the reality show <i>The Buried Life</i>.<span> </span>The premise of the show-- ""What do you want to do before you die?""-- is pretty corny, but Fang Island's exuberance is<span> perfect for chasing dreams. </span>While their manic musicianship and group-hug vibe may inspire more than a few comparisons to the badly missed Mae Shi, they aren't about proselytizing. This music is just honest and life-affirming and infectious, and it's that rare concentration of directness and simplicity that makes <i>Fang Island</i> so uniquely and wonderfully inclusive.</p></div>"|14011.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14011-fang-island/|8.3|Ian Cohen

That's less time than most Americans will spend at work in a day. While that pace created a final product much less polished than the band's previous work, <i>Rush to Relax </i>is also a more accurate, interesting sonic articulation of the band's frenetic frontman, Brendan Suppression. ""Anxiety"" picks up right where <i>Colours</i> left off-- its rubber-band riffs wrapped tightly around Suppression's existential babbling. The guitar sound is still a spring-loaded hybrid cobbled together from Saints and Stooges records.</p>
<p>At their best, <i>Rush to Relax</i>'s songs maintain a firm grip even when they meander. ""Gentleman"" and ""I Can Be a Jerk"" are essentially the same song, but while the former is pretty, the latter is too cute for its own good. And the band still has a tendency to jam around one whale of a crescendo, as though every song is capable of morphing into a kind of krautrock-infused soundcheck. (After all, these dudes originally formed during a lager-fueled jam session at the tail end of a Christmas party.) ""Tuning Out"" and ""Second Guessing"" fall under that category, and, despite some truly great stretches of psychedelic tension, both lose their grip fairly often. ""Burn"" is much more efficient and white-hot, Suppression sounding particularly ferocious when consoling a friend suffering from manic depression. Its foundation is basic, its hook sturdy. But its lyrical shift outward feels weirdly transformative.</p>
<p>In the album's titular closer, just before the three-minute mark, it sounds as though the band is about to take off on another hike-- the track has a 24-minute running time after all. But then something extraordinary happens. What felt like the rumblings of one hell of a ride became something completely different, zen even. After some existential tripping about ""going on a holiday and you're never coming back,"" Suppression nails down a mantra. Guitars begin to bleed into the sounds of surf lapping against the shore. ""Slow down before you fall down,"" he murmurs. And for the last 20 minutes of the record, you can hear nothing but water and sea birds in conversation with one another, all of it as mesmerizing as every riff and rant that came before.</p></div>"|14017.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14017-rush-to-relax/|7.5|David Bevan

The band uses simple, traditional elements but aims for something unique. Some songs feature just the voices of the three members; the rest of the time, they limit themselves to violin, a little double bass, and various percussion instruments. Recording much of their material live, their antecedents are as modern as drone and as old as early American folk, though with the latter they're often stretching the definition of the genre.</p>
<p>It helps that percussionist and singer Mark Trecka has a deep, sonorous baritone that can carry the long notes-- and there are many in the vocal-only opener ""Root/Joy""-- with a wizened authority.  The band uses vocals almost like stringed instruments, which become even more noticeable when violins are added to their chanting. Though its lyrics are sparse, ""The Center Of"" adds thick atmosphere via slow, reveberating percussion and the acrobatic vocal of violinist and singer Beth Remis (think the Dirty Projectors' female singers in half-time). Whether the band is chanting, thumbing a double bass, or shaking marimbas, it's hard to believe <i>Lay of Pilgrim Park</i> is the work of just three people in the same room, and their roles are so fluid it's hard to pick out where one member's contributions start and another ends. The album's abrupt changes, deliberate silences, and movements rather than verses and choruses feel almost more classical than folk (or jazz, or indie, or anything else they might be considered).</p>
<p>Though the wordless and percussion-less tracks sometimes can seem meandering and incidental, they add context to a tightly focused album-length piece. Part of what's exciting about the melody on the 12-minute ""Park Saint and Folly"" is that it resolves all the tense, hanging melodies that lead up to it. Still, the songs with more instrumentation and melodic drive are the clear highlights. ""Made Sheen"" doubles down on the percussion and repeats its title to hypnotic effect, and ""Park Saint and Folly"" builds from a solo string part into something layered and more purposeful-- even introducing a bassline in its ninth minute that’s almost funky. The malleability Pillars and Tongues introduce to more rigid, traditional forms of music should be really exciting-- at times it is-- but usually they're merely quietly impressive rather than visceral, so what could be thrilling often feels more like a museum piece.</p></div>"|14016.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14016-lay-of-pilgrim-park/|6.0|Jason Crock

The first half of that tag may seem misleading-- unless they're planning to hang 10 on Shutter Island, it's difficult to imagine surfing to Reed's more ominous tones. But considering Vancouver's cool summers and propensity for rain, Reed's debut EP for Warp, <i>Shaved</i>, could be easily pegged with a beach-bummed outlook.</p>
<p>As for the ""step"": despite the fact that dubstep's rapid splintering makes its classification tricky, distinct elements of that sound are disparately placed throughout <i>Shaved</i>. There are snapping backbeats, irregular rhythms, amorphous bass lines-- enough reference points to prove Reed's done his homework. But although <i>Shaved</i> sometimes flirts with pastiche, its most promising moments occur when Reed steps out of the comfort zone of genres-- both self-invented and preexistent-- and creates overcast, suffocating sonic landscapes.</p>
<p>The material collected here aren’t as much songs as they are dark mood pieces. Opening track ""Popcommon"" establishes the portentous mood-- its lone melodic line is a burnt-out, static charge that sounds like a jet engine powering down. Here and elsewhere Reed displays a talent for utilizing negative space, creating a sense of urban paranoia and isolation that runs throughout <i>Shaved</i>. ""Care"" recalls the Knife at their creepiest and most sparse, with a wizened female voice emerging from the horror-stringed ether, while the album-closing title track utilizes warped bass and muffled tones to create a doomsday atmosphere. If those two tracks are gearing up for the end of the world, then the ironically titled <i>Shaved</i> highlight ""Celebrate"" is pure atomic fallout, complete with static sheets and foghorns sounding a warning that no one will hear.</p>
<p><i>Shaved'</i>s weaker moments discard haunting atmospherics for genre formalism, such as the second-rate IDM of ""Tummy Sticks"" and the record's most uninspired, straightforwardly dubstep moment, ""Screwby"".  While the track begins promisingly, with a pair of skittering rhythms that juxtapose nicely, one-drop keyboard stabs and wobbly bass stick out like a fist full of sore thumbs. Ultimately, <i>Shaved</i> is successful when Reed is embracing his downbeat tendencies.

There are no big concepts or specific themes on Flying Nun's <i>In Love With These Times</i>, Homestead's <i>Human Music, </i>Teenbeat's<i> 50</i>, or K's <i>International Pop Underground Convention</i>,<i> </i>but something less tangible-- energy, common backgrounds, maybe just the serendipity of timing-- unifies these sets. Whatever it is, the label heads certainly heard something unifying in those bands, seeing past surface styles to a deeper camaraderie.</p>
<p>That kind of camaraderie is all over <i>PV006/IBB004</i>, whose odd-looking title replicates its two labels' catalog numbers. It helps that most of these bands-- rooted at their most basic in a shared love of lo-fi garage rock-- actually are comrades. Seek them out on MySpace and you'll see the others listed as top friends, alongside announcements about joint performances and split releases on cassette or vinyl. There's some kind of underground community bubbling up here, but there's no name for it yet. And if the album's title is any indication, the people involved don't want one. Aboveground recognition may come-- one contributor, Male Bonding, has a Sub Pop debut due in May. But as long as these bands get to keep playing together, whether their audience is the whole world or just each other seems kinda trivial.</p>
<p>The music itself is roughly recorded, but only a few tracks are drenched in noise or hidden behind walls of distortion. Songwriting is a priority, from the most basic two-chord melodies to some chops-heavy jams. It's all pop of the garage variety, and a lot of it is very catchy. Plug's ""Fresh Pleasures"" and La La Vasquez's ""Don't Rush Me"" both ride bass lines so sturdy they make off-kilter guitars and vocals sound oddly tuneful. Just as snappy are the ringing guitars of Cold Pumas' ""Tropical Guilt"" and Fair Ohs' ""Christmas Tree"", both mining territory between Abe Vigoda and Vampire Weekend.</p>
<p>But the point here isn't so much how each band sounds as how much energy they bring to the enervated proceedings. Even slower, more casual songs have a nervy insistence. Mazes deliver a creaking near-ballad that sounds like Times New Viking covering Dinosaur Jr., while Spectrals' offering conjures the primitive twang of Beat Happening. Still, the faster tunes on <i>PV006/IBB004 </i>captivate most, and the best come at the beginning and end. Teen Sheiks' ""Germs"" stirs New Zealand pop and American garage into an uncannily familiar hook. Twenty-two minutes later, Not Cool's ""Limbs are for Liars"" ends the comp with speed-punk rhythms and slashing guitar. Those bookends make for a nice prologue and epilogue, and while the album may not tell a specific story, there's certainly some kind of moral here-- maybe something about how great bands can sound when they feed off each other, both in real life and in the crackling grooves of well-sequenced vinyl.</p></div>"|14022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14022-pvi006ibb004/|7.5|Marc Masters

On their second album, New Jersey's Titus Andronicus split the emotional atom with anthemic chants, rousing sing-alongs, celebrations of binge drinking, marathon song titles, broken-hearted duets, punked-up Irish jigs, and classic rock lyric-stealing. And through it all, they take subtlety out on the town, pour a fifth of whiskey down its throat, write insults on its face in permanent marker, and abandon it in the woods.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Loosely based on the U.S. Civil War, <i>The Monitor</i> may be one of  the most absurd album concepts ever, invoking the battle that caused  Abraham Lincoln to claim, ""I am now the most  miserable man living,"" to illustrate the sound and fury of  suburban Jersey life in a shattered economy. In the annals of using historical metaphors for emotional communication, it's up there with Jeff Mangum empathizing with Anne Frank. But it all turns out so ridiculously fun-- with Ken Burns-style readings of speeches from Lincoln and Jefferson Davis, daguerreotype cover art, and song titles all participating in the reenactment-- that it never even begins to approach the pretentiousness these elements might suggest.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the end, the Civil War is just a recurring theme, and one that's more personal than political. For stadium-rock inspiration, Titus Andronicus look no further than their home-state hero, paraphrasing Bruce Springsteen in the first song and name-checking him in the last. And while the central muse is obvious, there's a full menu of influences on display. There's the Hold Steady in its mythology of intoxication, the Pogues in its cathartic singalong gutter-punk, and Conor Oberst's Desaparacidos in its brazen earnestness. There's also the fatalistic fuck-all of early Replacements and the brutalist thrashing of east-coast hardcore in its violent instrumentation and apocalyptic worldview.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Somehow that laundry-list of inspirations all manage to make an appearance in the first two minutes of leadoff track ""A More Perfect Union"". After an opening half that's equal parts slop and ambition, the album turns a corner on ""A Pot in Which to Piss"" and settles into a reliable pattern, each song building from frontman Patrick Stickles' self-described ""piss and moan"" to a punk-rock fury, and finally to an instrumental call-to-arms. The repeated structure feeds the album's narrative arc and provides some much-needed breathers, until the record's big finale. At 14 minutes, ""The Battle of Hampton Roads"" adds a couple of extra X's to the already XL project: Oscillating even more wildly between the album's twin poles of suicidal ideation and vengeance fantasies, Stickles builds to his frothiest moment, spilling it all out in a verse that rivals Neutral Milk Hotel's ""Oh Comely"" for uncomfortable honesty. And in the end there's a bagpipe solo.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""The enemy is everywhere,"" Stickles keeps reminding us over the course of the record. It's difficult to tell what that enemy is, as Stickles' target moves from social anxiety to pure boredom to the symbolic frat-brahs of ""Hampton Roads"". But as the casualties pile up and the battle hymns keep egging on the troops, it becomes clear that the opponent isn't nearly as important as the fight itself. Catharsis is Stickles' fuel, and <i>The Monitor</i> is a 65-minute endorsement of angst and opposition as the best way to present that combustible sorrow: Light it with footlights, throw a giant shadow against the back wall, and rock the fuck out of it.</p></div>"|14010.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14010-the-monitor/|8.7|Rob Mitchum

But his debut LP as Infinite Body, <i>White Hymn</i>, found him working with surprisingly restrained tones; it was pretty but transitional. His new album, <i>Carve Out the Face of My God</i>, released on the label run by No Age's Dean Spunt, is bolder and fully realized, with almost every shoegazey glow countered by a noisy growl. Parker's noise origins are perceptible in his music, but you could boil down the story to ""Lapsed harsh noise guy goes soft; produces best work of his career."" This sort of mellowing usually happens over time-- think of how Hisham Bharoocha's music changed from Lightning Bolt to Black Dice to Soft Circle. Parker seems to have leapfrogged ahead: Gator Surprise was gnarlier than Lightning Bolt, while Infinite Body is dreamier than Soft Circle.</p>
<p>Here, Parker has managed to synthesize a lot of familiar sounds into a broadly appealing statement: Burning Star Core's contoured interference, MBV's ear-piercing chords, and Rhys Chatham's invincible distortion. Parker's own thumbprint manifests in the clear, meticulous interplay of these elements. ""Dive"" operates on three distinct levels: a warm, soupy base drone, a high modulating one, and a graceful synth melody that slowly rocks back and forth. The timbre of the melody bloats as the drones fade out, so that it seems to be soaking up the distortion. Transparency is the album's watchword: All transactions between noise and beauty are fully disclosed.</p>
<p>A good deal of variety fits within these generous parameters. ""A Fool Persists"" is merely a single string figure that rises and gently crumbles, over and over. It doesn't sound like much on paper, but slight modulations in the tempo and phrasing give the stack of notes a slightly different character with each repetition. It's actually one of the most magical tracks here-- black and white spilling into Technicolor on a quiet loop. ""On Our Own to Fall Off"" is shot through with glassy, chattering lines, like a distorted Field track with the drums stripped off. And ""Sunshine"", the most involved composition, exemplifies Parker's artfully mechanical approach-- gradually turning itself inside out, its staccato pulse giving way to a mass of drones. Parker's diligence pays off big. <i>Carve Out the Face of My God</i> is overwhelming, but not disorienting, thanks to core melodies that work like signposts pointing our way through the distortion. It's a rare meeting of raw force and listener-friendly order.</p></div>"|14012.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14012-carve-out-the-face-of-my-god/|8.2|Brian Howe

Nearly a year before the breakup, frontman Miles Kurowsky was already questioning the purpose of continuing, telling <i>Rolling Stone</i>, ""Here I am in an indie rock band that's done     quite well and done a lot of things we never thought we would.   We've played festivals, we've been on     <i>Conan O'Brien</i>... but at the end of the day I wonder what  I've done.  All I got is some crow's feet.     What's the fucking prize?""</p>
<p>Though they never quite gained the foothold it seemed they might've during their eight-year run, Beulah's catalog has won them quite a few converts in the years since their split, with this new crew finding particular solace in their later work. Now, after six years of almost complete silence, Kurosky delivers his solo debut, <i>The</i><i> Desert of Shallow Effects</i>, to a cult in waiting. I can't help but think of fellow California pop geeks Weezer a decade ago; their difficult post-hiatus work, like this newfound appreciation of Beulah's last couple records, had served as a new entrance point for latecomers while the band was in limbo, and upon reentry, the band found itself faced with an unusual set of expectations.</p>
<p>In a few ways, <i>Desert</i> could've easily served as the next Beulah record; Kurosky's voice hasn't lost a step in his years away, and it's as pristinely orchestrated as ever, thanks in part to the many ex-Beulah members lending a hand. But Kurosky, who's likened these newer songs to stories rather than his earlier confessionals and free associations, seems hellbent on making sure we consider the half-decade-plus he's had to incubate these numbers. The songs have grown knottier and the arrangements more finicky, and Kurosky's lyrics have shed much of their directness in favor of more emphasis on narrative. It's a striking pullback from the swoony sulk of <i>Yoko</i> and <i>The Coast Is Never Clear</i>;<i> </i>like Weezer's Green Album, it's a proficient but impersonal collection of tunes that seem guided less by heart than by a kind of muscle memory.</p>
<p><i>Desert of Shallow Effects</i> is a tremendous <i>sounding</i> record, brimming with nuance but never averse to orchestral overload. It's a precision attack, and as lofty and lovely as these tunes can sound, even their note-perfect nature seems to hold the listener at arm's length. But the real distance in the record is generated by Kurosky's lyrics, a series of clipped phrases and red herrings loosely compiled in the shape of story-songs, rich in imagistic detail but short in the personals department. This is a guy whose best-ever lyric might be ""all we need is a pretty song,"" but there's simply nothing that directly affecting here; it's as if Kurosky, shy of the virulent response to his heart-on-sleeve stuff from <i>Coast</i> and <i>Yoko</i>, wanted nothing more than to stay the hell out of the way this time around. And, while a line or two pops out of nearly every song here, his tendency to shove several words where a few would do further adds to <i>Desert</i>'s overstuffed feeling.</p>
<p>Amidst all the prim and proper stuff here, picking moments that stand out proves a challenge. The Beulah loyal may well lap this one up, but it's hard to imagine Kurosky's solo bow winning him many newfound fans; unless you're all about flute solos and such, <i>Desert</i> is just a tough record to make inroads with. It's nice to see Kurosky has moved on from the beauteous bumouts of the <i>Yoko</i> days and good to see he's not interested in repeating himself, but were <i>Desert</i> the fifth Beulah record, it'd be the fifth best. One hopes next time around, after getting six years' worth of songs out of his system, Kurosky can find a way to sneak some more heart into the symphonies playing in his head.</p></div>"|14014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14014-the-desert-of-shallow-effects/|6.0|Paul Thompson

Much of the music on <i>Be So True</i> shares some of the same hallmarks that freckle that movement: soft pulsing rhythms, dream-washed melodies, and nostalgia-inducing electronic patterns. Much less sample-heavy than its predecessor, this year's earlier <i>Sunndreamm</i> EP, <i>Be So True</i> collects more straightforward, deeply romantic electro-pop creations, alternately simmering with joy and traces of fragility.</p>
<p>The music here sounds more synthetic than most current bedroom electronic projects, and Diaz reconfigures aqueous tones with an impressive array of rhythmic accents to give his productions momentum. But it's Diaz's vocals that lend a much-needed organic element. Though it's sometimes difficult to locate exactly what Diaz might be saying, since he often chops and pitch-shifts his already distant-sounding voice much like Washed Out's Ernest Greene does, lyrical sentiments take a backseat as his words melt into the lushness of his productions, often evoking a mood or emotion with a simple vocal intonation.</p>
<p>With the careful attention Diaz pays to his assortment of drum sounds, it's also easy to make a dance connection-- even the day-glo artwork suggests the EP has as much to do with movement as feeling. ""Cynthia"" and ""Soft Denial"" possess enough momentum and blissed-out nuance to earn club play. But due to paced, introspective additions like the slow, Human League-indebted ""Mien"" or quick interlude ""Pilfer"", <i>Be So True</i> feels most rewarding in headphones, as repeat listens find the record inhabiting a more somber, personal space.</p>
<p>Most ambitious and impressive is the closing track, ""Day We Met"", a distorted collage of the ideas and accents Diaz toys with throughout the disc's too-brief 17-minute span. Here, a more complex time signature gives way to cascading percussion, a pair of intertwining, waterfall-like synths, and a clipped female vocal. Only about midway through does Diaz's own voice appear to bring order to the mounting chaos. ""I just want to hold it all in my hands,"" he wails as the storm finally begins to break. Here, Diaz gets his wish, as <i>Be So True </i>is condensed into one fractured swoop.</p></div>"|14018.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14018-be-so-true-ep/|7.6|Zach Kelly

One of the most misguided was that I assumed the amount of stuff I'd like would be manageable. I now know how wrong that was-- and that's a positive. I also figured that highlife would be something really distinct, a highly specific sound that was easy to describe. It turns out it's more like rock-- rock music isn't any one thing. It's more of an umbrella term to blanket a group of related styles, and so it is with highlife as well.</p>
<p>Highlife has its roots in the coastal towns of modern Ghana, where it developed in the early 20th century as a fusion of calypso, sailors' songs, palm-wine guitar music from Sierra Leone and Liberia, rhythms from both inland and across the ocean in the Caribbean, and European harmonic concepts. As it caught on, it became acquisitive, adding horn arrangements indebted to European dance bands and American jazz, rebuilding first around the electric guitar and then around synthesizers and drums machines a couple of decades later. It moved to the rest of English-speaking West Africa, absorbed the sensibilities of R&amp;B and funk, fragmented into subgenres, and survives today as a powerful thread tying together generations of musicians.</p>
<p>Soundway's second <i>Nigeria Special</i> volume homes in on the early 1970s and gives us a glimpse of what highlife sounded like in Africa's most populous nation during that period. It attempts to do it all in one disc stuffed with 20 tracks (or three LPs with 22). Like 2008's first volume, it digs deep, touching on artists familiar to those who have kept up with the wave of Afro sound compilations and reissues over the past few years, while locating a huge trove of obscurities. The vibe across most of the comp is laid-back and confident, with plenty of harmony vocals, horns, and buoyant rhythms.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there are the guitars-- the cycling, fluid lines that underpin virtually every song. Highlife guitar styles vary considerably from player to player, but they all seem to have constant motion in common. The ragged, angular lines of Fidel Sax Bateke &amp; the Voices of Darkness' ""Motako"" sound dissimilar to the mellow-toned, interlocking parts that snake around the cowbell and conga of Fubura Sekibo's ""Psychedelic Baby"", but they serve a similar function-- pushing the music forward and building a lush harmonic bed for the vocal harmonies and horns.</p>
<p>For listeners looking for a bit more influence from funk and Afrobeat, they can get that from Tunji Oyelana &amp; the Benders, whose ""Iwo Ko la Dami"" clearly bears the stamp of Fela Kuti's Afrobeat in its muted guitars, stabbing horn arrangement, and fluttering, jazzy drum part. ""Shango Oba Onina"" by Black's Zenith is short and punchy, with crashing horns, a taut vocal, and catchy rhythm section, and the Don Isaac Ezekiel Combination get funky with the Lord's Prayer, literally setting it to music.</p>
<p>The strangest cuts that stretch furthest outside what I've come to think of as highlife's malleable boundaries are ""Totobiroko (Ogbele)"", by Twins Seven-Seven &amp; His Golden Cabretas, which loads up a rampaging beat with talking drum and vibraphone to back a chanting vocal, and Joy Nwoso &amp; Dan Satch's ""Egwo Umu Agbogho"", which wraps up the CD version of the compilation with a straight-enough highlife arrangement over which Nwoso wails operatically in an incredible display of vocal virtuosity.</p>
<p>For listeners who haven't yet explored beyond some of the funkier, more overtly Western-influenced styles of African music, <i>Nigeria Special, Vol. 2</i> offers a fine selection of 70s highlife that can help point toward new avenues of exploration, while offering a handful of selections that provide easy entry points. In fact, it somewhat mirrors the way I got into highlife myself, gradually letting go of the funk and soul elements that helped me get into vintage African pop to begin with. If you're already into highlife, this set provides a wealth of welcome surprises, with plenty of information to help you wrap your head around where all this stuff has been hiding.</p></div>"|14003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14003-nigeria-special-vol-2-modern-highlife-afro-sounds-nigerian-blues-1970-6/|8.1|Joe Tangari

In the past decade, Danger Mouse's landmark<i> Grey Album</i> mash-up and membership in Gnarls Barkley  helped anticipate indie rock's increasing openness to hip-hop and R&amp;B crossovers. A couple of years earlier, James Mercer paved the way for future indie crossover  success stories with the Shins' <i>Garden State</i> contribution and controversial Olympics-aired McDonald's commercial. That the pair's paths might eventually cross was more inevitable than unexpected.</p>
<p>Mercer and Danger Mouse's debut as Broken Bells is not quite up to the level of either's best projects, but in its own quiet way, it hits its marks. The pair first worked together on the David Lynch/Sparklehorse project <i>Dark Night of the Soul</i>, and <i>Broken Bells</i> picks up the sadsack spirit of that record-- it's a deceptively catchy album centered on personal loss. It's unclear whether we're supposed to trace Mercer's lyrical malaise to a shattered relationship with his band (Mercer split with Shins mates Marty Crandall and Jesse Sandoval in 2008), a lover, or both. But this much is certain: Something has ended.</p>
<p>In the album's brightest moments, there are enough swooning harmonies,   replayable choruses, and psych-baked production elements that you might   not even notice Mercer's dark thoughts. Besides, the singer is clearly attempting to move on here, taking advantage of this fresh setting to try on new looks: film-score orchestration and acid flange meet a <i>Pet Sounds</i>-like vocal odyssey on ""Your Head Is on Fire""; ""The Mall &amp; the Misery"" opens with Springsteen-ian Americana and then veers off into post-punk guitar stabs; ""Sailing to Nowhere"" is a horror-show waltz; and Mercer's nearly unrecognizable falsetto on album standout ""The Ghost  Inside"" recalls the high, cracked croon of another Danger Mouse collaborator,  Blur/Gorillaz singer Damon Albarn.</p>
<p>An early version of the record included a nicely gloomy song with Knife-like vocal effects that's been replaced by the sumptuous psych-pop balladry of ""Citizen"". ""Trap Doors"", already one of the album's catchiest songs, benefits from some extra synths and backing vocals, and ""October"" has a few new lyrics.</p>
<p>Still, unlike its creators' best prior accomplishments, <i>Broken Bells </i> doesn't seem prepared, or even attempting, to cross over. Nor does it feel like a new direction or outlet for either artist-- it's more of a nice detour. In one of the record's more cheerful moments, amid the shambling acoustic guitar and slithering keyboard of ""October"", he shares some helpful advice: ""Don't run, don't rush, just float."" It's what he and Danger Mouse do here, and while that's hardly a recipe for breaking new ground, the results are rarely less than pleasant.</p>

Whether it's wordless yowling, an extended cover of ""Somebody to Love"", or something as disarming as <i>The Spoils</i>' ""Clay Bodies"", her singing has a way of sticking in your memory. Even so, the <i>Stridulum</i> EP represents a large stride forward, not just in production quality, but in the band's focus. Heard next to their gauzy beginnings, these six synth-driven tracks sound surprisingly clear, even poppy. Whether this cleaner sound is here to stay or not, the emotions behind the music are just as heavy, and this self-contained EP is the perfect place for the band to try something different.</p>
<p>Danilova still belts out the lyrics from behind layers of cavernous reverb and the overall sound remains dramatic and foreboding. And though there are moments here where the foundation rumbles and the sound is disorienting, recording quality has nothing to do with it. Instead, Zola Jesus are more inclined to shake up the atmosphere with dissonance, like the whirring that disrupts the otherwise calming ""Trust Me"" or the ominous chamber-of-souls hissing at the end of ""Night"". Still, these hints of abstraction haunt the margins of more direct songs where hooky verses and memorable choruses are the norm.</p>
<p>The tracks on <i>Stridulum</i> follow a pattern that opener ""Night"" nails at the start: They build from minimal but insistent beats and simple melodies into crescendos where the synthesizer tones, sampled incidental noise, and layered vocals merge into a stirring whole. Danilova leans on immediate, familiar phrases here: ""At the end of the night, we'll be together again""; ""When you're lost, know I'll be around""; ""It's not easy to fall in love""; ""I can't stand to see you this way"". The lyrics are visceral, and swooning chords and always-operatic vocals multiply the effect. Zola Jesus may be experimenting in more earnest and accessible pop here, but the charged theatrical mood is just as overwhelming.</p>
<p>Zola Jesus' brooding, gothic vibe probably isn't going anywhere, nor is their willingness to experiment with the sonics and constraints of their songs. But <i>Stridulum</i>'s immediately striking cover art hints at the depth of the band's ambition: Their personality is still here, but there's more thought in the composition and the presentation. So rather than cleaning up and getting ready for a close-up, the EP feels more like a lateral move, in the best possible way-- there's no guessing what comes next.</p></div>"|13987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13987-stridulum-ep/|8.1|Jason Crock

The singer's last full length with White Hinterland, 2008's <i>Phylactery Factory</i>, swayed to brushed drums, dainty piano, and perky vocals. Later that year, she created prickly, sophisticated art-lounge on the <i>Luniculaire </i>EP, a collection of originals and covers all sung in French. Like her earlier work, there was still a strong theatrical element in those edgier songs, but it didn't exactly point the way toward the hazy pop pulse of <i>Kairos.</i></p>
<p>From the opening seconds of the album-- a lazy tide pool of swirling synths and echoing vocals-- White Hinterland strike a different pose. The graceful piano, chamber-pop arrangements, and storybook lyrics of the past were crisp snapshots; <i>Kairos </i>is a collection of over-exposed and landscapes-- bold, blurred, and wide open.</p>
<p>Dienel and bandmate Shawn Creeden removed the piano from the equation on <i>Kairos</i>, and the result is a textbook case of addition by subtraction. Dienel's voice, still delicate and fluttering, sounds more powerful and expressive, free and untethered from the jazzy arrangements of the past. With antiquated references stricken from the lyric sheet, Dienel's words come off as more personal and direct. She swoons on ""Cataract"" and ""Magnolias"", two of the gorgeous tracks in which her sweet tone and confident phrasing, along with unfurled guitar melodies, recall <i>Bitte Orca.</i></p>
<p>Considering the album's chugging, fuzzy rhythms and lo-fi synth wash, Dirty Projectors won't be the only indie reference point cited when discussing <i>Kairos. </i>But the myriad of elements, from the dubstep-grade bass hits to looped vocals, beautifully comes together. <i>Kairos</i> represents a bold step for Dienel and White Hinterland, a re-imagining of the music-making process and an example of musical experimentation and evolution. As the restless Dienel sings on ""Moon Jam"", ""I am afraid of so many things/ But I do not fear the future.""</p></div>"|13982.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13982-kairos/|7.5|Patrick Sisson

<div>
<p>Aloha practically sum up their new album with the line ""your sunrise knocks me to the ground."" Hell, that could describe songwriter Tony Cavallario's imagination and career trajectory, too-- his characters occasionally emerge from the shadows, make a small ripple, then retreat. <i>Acres </i>is Aloha's first full-length since 2006's <i>Some Echoes</i>, and it picks up where that album left off: tales of anti-social sadsacks set to a pristine mix of Chicago indie-prog and late-90s emo. Though he's still trying to figure out how to pen a memorable chorus, Cavallario's melodies are sharper than ever here, and they're again ably fleshed out by engineer T.J. Lipple and Chad Clark. It won't knock you down, but at a few points, <i>Acres</i> is the best stuff they've ever done.</p>
<p>The key to enjoying an Aloha record is to hone in on the sounds and textures as much as the stories. With that in mind, <i>Acres</i>provides plenty of subtle rewards.<b> </b>The dizzy organ under the refrain of ""I'm in Trouble"", the <i>Hail to the Thief</i>-style rumbling bass/guitar of opener ""Building a Fire"", the processed guitar tone of ""Everything Goes My Way"", Cale Parks' off-the-chains drumming and trademark marimba-- they all reward repeat headphone listening. Yet at the same time, Cavallario's able to push the band out into the light like never before. The jangly power-pop of standout ""Searchlight"" and the propulsive ""Cold Storage"" are as catchy as the band is typically rhythmically potent, and they rank amongst the top tier of the group's catalog.</p>
<p>Yet this is still an Aloha record, and certain things about the music aren't ever going to change. It's important to note that the ""pop"" moments here aren't going to make you forget Big Star; instead, they sound vibrant amongst a stark, occasionally oppressive atmosphere. Simply skimming through song titles and the dark cover art previews Cavallario's basic dark/light dichotomy-- along with ""Searchlight"", there's ""Blackout"", ""White Wind"", and Moonless March"". It's made clear if you read the lyric sheet that his poetic point is to create a sense of confusion and disorder about the relative value of the private and the public. With <i>Home Acres</i>, Aloha themselves have come out of hiding again, and showed that, just maybe, a little more sunlight might do them some good.</p>

And then, boom: Wayne Rogers launched into the first of many acid-rock solos and full-front assaults. I was awestruck in a way you assume people felt when first seeing, say, session guitarist Pete Cosey (best known for his work with Miles Davis) or Wayne Kramer (MC5).</p>
<p>I don't throw those comparison points around lightly, either. But Rogers, partner Kate Biggar, and third guitarist Tom Leonard do play as if the merger of those two turn-of-the-70s titans was the most natural thing the world. The Major Stars sound begins with the post-blues/proto-metal of the MC5 at their most raucous. Unlike many 21st century bands known for guitar pyro, <i>Return to Form</i> trucks in muscular anthems rather than sprawling mess. Tunes like ""Black Point"" and ""Low Grade"" are as memorable for their rhythm section's heavy-machinery lurch as the feedback splatter. Which just makes the freaky, near-freeform soloing-- think electric jazz before it was tamed into fusion or psychedelia at its most caustic-- all the more surprising when it erupts on ""Black Point"".</p>
<p>But despite what you may have heard-- or how the above sounds-- this is <i>not</i> is a noise band, at least in the feedback-for-its-own-sake sense of the word. At their best, Major Stars combine tight riffs and chops with a deep, abiding love for joyous guitar slop. Vocalist Sandra Barett only sometimes adds to the band's hummability quotient. If nothing else her slightly droning style adds a human presence, sometimes tough and sometimes surprisingly fragile, to what would otherwise be an hour of epic screech and murk. But she's not Major Stars' focal point by a longshot; the guitarists have a lot more charisma. Major Stars' leads alone could command an arena, if bands this hairy hadn't been banned from arenas a long time ago.</p>
<p>But occasionally the devotion to six-string mayhem overwhelms the songwriting, and unless you really get off on reams of guitar raunch, Major Stars on CD may still not be for you. Sure, <i>Return to Form</i> has the sound of hardcore 1970s psych down, even if the mp3 is about as ideal for capturing the music's oomph as cheap hi-fi's and transistor radios were 40 years ago. But for music as much about volume and spectacle and physicality, it's undeniably easier to be wowed when the band is within spitting distance-- flopping all over each other, axes and hair flying, amps approaching critical mass. <i>Return to Form</i> may not always have the tunes or the funkadelic special effects to keep casual listeners interested in the comfort of their own homes/cars/heads. Still, if the album sometimes feels like an advertisement for the next Major Stars tour, well, it's still a pretty damned good advertisement.</p></div>"|14013.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14013-return-to-form/|6.4|Jess Harvell

Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett's animated misfits have always been mainly interesting as a concept, and on much of the third Gorillaz album, <i>Plastic Beach</i>, it feels like Albarn and co. are ditching the idea of writing pop songs a cartoon band might front anyway. The one-time Blur frontman has transcended some of the post-modern artifice of this project, and created the group's most affecting and uniquely inviting album. Joke's over, Gorillaz are real.</p>
<p>So why make this a Gorillaz album in the first place? It wasn't meant to be one. Hewlett, the celebrated <i>Tank Girl</i> co-creator, told <i>The Observer</i> last July, ""Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters anymore-- it's more like an organization of people doing new projects."" The project was to be called <i>Carousel</i>, presented by, but not performed by, Gorillaz. It never panned out. So Albarn devised <i>Plastic Beach</i>, a loose enviromental-song cycle warning against disposability. It's a noble conceit, if a transient one.</p>
<p>Along with a typically diverse band of collaborators, Albarn dips into Krautrock, funk, and dubstep, as well as the weary, more melodic music he's been perfecting for much of last decade-- sort of an electronic take on baroque pop. Albarn also sounds more comfortable as a leader here than he has in some time. On the standout ""On Melancholy Hill"", he recalls the swooning strains of one of his heroes, Scott Walker. And when he shares or cedes vocals, he has the good sense to turn things over to luminaries like Lou Reed (magnificently dry-throated on ""Some Kind of Nature"") and Bobby Womack (good on first single ""Stylo"", better on the twangy ""Cloud of Unknowing""), while effortlessly integrating them into the sound.</p>
<p>Handling most of the production himself, Albarn has reversed the good fortune of the first two Gorillaz albums. With Dan the Automator on their 2001 self-titled debut and Danger Mouse on 2005's <i>Demon Days</i>, the group was adept at fusing giddy pop with hip-hop, inserting De La Soul, Del the Funky Homosapien, or a yippy Miho Hatori into some of their best songs (""Clint Eastwood"", ""Dirty Harry"", ""Feel Good Inc."", ""19-2000""). Those songs crashed in from all places with little mind to sequence or balance, and the result was two fairly unfocused records saved by some decent alt-rap.</p>
<p>On <i>Plastic Beach</i>, things are the other way around. The rap moments here feel almost needlessly idiosyncratic amidst the lusher treatments. Snoop Dogg's appearance on ""Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach"" is an incongruous introduction to an album that has nothing to do with Snoop Dogg. De La repeat themselves on the faux jingle ""Superfast Jellyfish"". Grime MCs Kano and Bashy compellingly play pass-the-baton on ""White Flag"", but only after disrupting an absorbing intro and outro by the Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. Only on ""Sweepstakes"" is Mos Def able to assimilate into the production.</p>
<p>Albarn is more natural when working in the kind of ornate <i>Village Green Preservation Society</i>-style pop that dominates <i>Plastic Beach</i>. His collaborations with Little Dragon, ""Empire Ants"" and ""To Binge"" are two of the most arresting things here-- they're airy, elusive, and amazingly beautiful. It's been years since Albarn has written anything as blatantly gorgeous. If he had to work past the animated pretense to rediscover it, all the better. Why be a cartoon when you can be a real person?</p></div>"|14008.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14008-plastic-beach/|8.5|Sean Fennessey

Sure, the California leather jacketers came up a few years after the Dandy Warhols and Brian Jonestown Massacre, and more or less alongside Detroit garage-rockers like the White Stripes. But 2001 debut <i>B.R.M.C.</i> loudly heralded the rock-is-back swagger that would soon hit glossy magazines in the form of the Strokes, the Vines, and the Hives. As if that weren't enough, BRMC's stratosphere-pummel predicted not only the Jesus and Mary Chain reunion, the Magnetic Fields' <i>Distortion</i>, and A Place to Bury Strangers, but also last year's Verve-scale electro-shoegaze anthems by the Big Pink.</p>
<p>Here in the future, though, the sneering young dudes who once asked ""Whatever Happened to My Rock'n'Roll"" now bear all the telltale signs of a band desperately flailing to live up to the dangerousness of their band name. In 2005, that meant divisive folk-blues change-up <i>Howl</i>. In 2008, it meant not-even-divisive insomniac-wank instrumental album <i>The Effects of 333</i>. Sixth studio outing <i>Beat the Devil's Tattoo</i> is already getting billed as the one that brings all these prodigal sons' (and daughters'-- ex-Raveonette Leah Shapiro is now on drums) stylistic detours back home. It kind of is, but if BRMC's sound has cohered, their songwriting has unfortunately done the opposite.</p>
<p>So yeah, <i>Beat the Devil's Tattoo</i> assembles BRMC's full arsenal of swamp-stomp riffage, chain-gang acoustic blues, rawk-Spiritualized psych-gospel, endlessly repeated gothic nonsense, and effects-geek pedal farts. And no, of course, originality isn't <i>necessarily</i> a prerequisite for rock'n'roll fun times. So if someone apathetically intoning about whether he wants to ""feel love"" on a midtempo Velvet Underground guttersnipe castoff called ""Evol"" (yup) is enough to make you remember that, oh my gosh, <i>you</i> wanna feel love, then who am I to argue? Plus BRMC can sound surprisingly pretty when finding the tear in Ryan Adams' blandly folksy beer (""The Toll"", ""Sweet Feeling""); in a Grand Funk/Free way, their bluesy proto-punk jams (""Conscience Killer"", ""Shadow's Keeper"") or mythological T. Rex boogie (""River Styx"") can be mookishly satisfying-- big dumb fun.</p>
<p>There's a fine line, however, between ""big dumb fun"" and ""insulting your intelligence."" The Ride-like whooshes of ""Mama Taught Me Better"" (main lyric: ""It brings me down""), are one thing, but finale ""Half State"" stretches the 1990s neopsych pedal play to an utterly excruciating 10 minutes. Witchy-woman screamer ""Aya"" and vaguely political lurcher ""War Machine"" feel like they were probably already somewhere in this band's catalog. And there's little fun for anyone, dumb or otherwise, on piano-pop comedown ""Long Way Down"". Besides, BRMC already had<i> </i>a release that brings together all their disparate elements: last year's solid, strobe-lit DVD/CD package <i>Live</i>, which actually has some memorable songs. Chalk it up to another case of being ahead of their time.</p></div>"|14001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14001-beat-the-devils-tattoo/|4.0|Marc Hogan

Sure, released by Neurot Recordings, it's one of the few titles in the band's two-decade run to have a substantial marketing push, but it's also one of the most extreme. Built on depth charges and swan dives into razing nine- and 14-minute instrumental immersions, and forgoing any pause between them, <i>Strange Keys</i> overpowers and exhilarates, the sort of record that rewards the commitment it demands with intensity and brutality.</p>
<p>The history of British experimental legend Matthew Bower is perhaps the only thing more overwhelming about his discography: Since the early 80s, Bower has been a persistent if oftentimes overlooked presence in international sound exploration, first with his projects Pure and Total and then with Skullflower. That's the band that took Bower places, particularly to North American audiences, thanks to 1992's <i>IIIrd Gatekeeper,</i> reissued stateside on Crucial Blast in 2007. A lumbering, playfully psychedelic record that cut big-beat paths through a world of weird guitar tones and stretched riffs, <i>IIIrd Gatekeeper</i> served as an introduction for Bower, who's since proven to be one of music's most restless and prolific souls, rivaled in his own spheres only by Jandek and David Tibet for variety and output.</p>
<p>In 1996, though, Skullflower disbanded. Bower busied himself with the often still, stately collaborations of Sunroof! and the earliest releases by his power electronics duo, the Hototogisu. After a seven-year break, Bower revived the handle for the LP <i>Exquisite Fucking Boredom</i>, a sprawling, gorgeous record that seems to revel in reverse. But on the closing track, ""Celestial Highway IV"", the sound bristles, the melody and beat wheezing beneath the pressure of static, noise, and a guitar line that won't sit still. By track's end, you can kind of trace a melody.</p>
<p>That concept-- burying and occasionally revealing something familiar beneath a harsh flood of sounds-- has served as Bower's chief compositional device with the second incarnation of Skullflower.<i> </i>It's loud music-- really loud music-- that demands you sit close and listen up. <i>Strange Keys</i> ups the ante: Though ""Gateway to Blasphemous Light"" and ""Enochian Tapestries"" settle into moments of warped bliss, <i>Strange Keys</i> is generally relentless and tremendous, burying its themes in kaleidoscopic distortion. It's as if the comparisons that Bower has earned in the last seven years-- Merzbow, Wagner, second wave black metal-- finally took magnificent hold.</p>
<p>All of those comparisons compute, too. In fact, together they are only parts of a much bigger musical picture, where dozens of sounds connect in a dense though meticulous web, waiting to be teased out and untangled by the listener. And in the end, devoting two hours at a time to <i>Strange Keys </i>and chasing down whatever phantom sounds you think you might hear at work is what makes this such a rewarding-- if difficult-and-demanding to irritating-and-impossible-- listen, especially on return spins.</p>
<p>Something about ""City of Dis"", for instance, suggests the mechanical flux of a breathing machine, though its wide peaks-and-valleys motion recalls an all-star noise team scrambling the Death in June discography-- rigorous and mean with drama-- and dredging up an album that sounds nothing like the source. Similarly, ""Gateway to Blasphemous Light"" sounds as though every cheap black metal recording in the world-- you know, those early ones so loud that everything sounds like a smear-- was dumped into a 14-minute space and blurred together into one tidal piece.</p>
<p>Most illustrative, though, are ""Rheingold"" and ""Blood Mirror Streams"", two seven-minute pieces on the altogether more-finessed second disc. They pile pounding sheets of noise above gentle, distended riffs, which poke out of the maelstrom like lone rays of light. In its loudness, it faintly recalls Fuck Buttons'<i> ""</i>Sweet Love for Planet Earth"", where ruined tones hovered above house beats and chirpy keyboard melodies. That's all to say that, for its controlled destruction and distortion, there are moments here that suggest the possibility of redemption. Listen for them: You at least know you're bound to hear something else, too.</p></div>"|13999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13999-strange-keys-to-untune-gods-firmament/|8.2|Grayson Currin

Showing up a tad late to the backpack renaissance, Penn graduates Naledge and Double-O have spent three records now trying on several different hats, none of which fit particularly well or were worn comfortably. Maybe we just expected two Ivy Leaguers to make music that was challenging musically and lyrically; instead we got odes to drunk girls and corny self-esteem lectures. If that's how they want to get down, the more power to them.</p>
<p><i>Land of Make Believe</i> pitches itself as the most ambitious record of the duo's career, most notably thanks to Double-O's sample-free production. It's a clear attempt to steer from the classic hip-hop staples and try to update the Kidz's sound. Double-O always had a good ear for the soul-driven boom-bap that marked their debut and 2008's <i>The In Crowd</i>, so this route, albeit contemporary, removes a strength from his work. From the flat chip-tune bounce of ""Running"" (a ""Day 'N' Nite"" rip if there ever was one) to the diet-disco on ""L_O_V_E"", most of <i>Land of Make Believe</i> is going for a decidedly pop and ""now"" look, but one that often feels unnatural.</p>
<p>The long list of guests here indicates a record in need of some padding, but most of these names provide little more than hook fodder. For every Kid Daytona (who does a pretty enjoyable Slick Rick on ""Out to Lunch"") there's a handful of unnecessary rappers and overly dramatic crooners adding to the already chintzy mélange. Most notable is Canadian goofball Colin Munroe, whose hook on the appallingly schmaltzy, big-album-moment ""Take Over the World"" (co-produced by Just Blaze) finally confirms that Mr. Hudson's feature fee is as dangerously high as we feared.</p>
<p>Along with a lack of hooks, the real trouble lies with Naledge. He's always sported a decent flow and been able to pull off the occasional clever punch (opening ""Intro"" is a good example) throughout his career. Between being often either overvalued or undervalued, it's no wonder Naledge spends a good portion of <i>Land of Make Believe</i> explaining how much effort he expends trying to prove himself. Too bad he never really uses any of this space to actually make a case either way.</p>
<p>Instead, most of Naledge's time is spent shrouded behind Cartier shades, talks about getting drunk like he's still a junior in high school, and making grandiose claims about his mic proficiency. Naledge often finds himself tangled in contradiction, or simply stuck in worn conceptual territory. The overwrought sex jams (""Bougie Girls"", ""Jukebox"") and flossing <i>ad nauseam</i> (""Fresh Academy"") might be tacky, but he's never as unbecoming as when his braggadocio lies in direct contention to his actual skill set. It's in these instances that the Kidz once again find themselves scrambling to catch up, no matter how they try and convince that they're in the lead.</p></div>"|13994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13994-land-of-make-believe/|4.0|Zach Kelly

But while most of Titus' associates, whether it's Fucked Up, Spider Bags, or Vivian Girls, have some sort of relation to their beer-and-spittle soaked populist rage, Dinowalrus' influences are notable for their inaccessibility: Sonic Youth circa <i>Bad Moon Rising</i>, no wavers like Flipper and Glenn Branca.</p>
<p>Yet that overstates <i>%</i>'s standoffishness-- judging from the song-length ambient break of ""I Hate Letters"" and the rafter-reaching, reverb-soaked ""I Hate Numbers"", the album won't be too prickly for anyone who still listens to Deerhunter's <i>Cryptograms</i> in its intended sequence. But where that album's flow was crucial, Dinowalrus stays true to its name by smashing incompatible parts together into an intriguing, if occasionally nonsensical, sonic blend. So much of ""Electric Car, Gas Guitar"", for example could've been explored further, from the exposed-wire synth shocks to the dub-like reverb effects, to squawking saxophone. About the only thing that holds it together is an almost joke-y baritone from Feigenbaum that barks lyrics like, ""A Chinese wall/ A toilet stall.""</p>
<p>Dinowalrus are too chaotic to have memorable structure, but not unpredictable enough to bring to mind improv. The Steve Reich nod ""Bead"" straightens its cycling synths into a sturdy four-on-the-floor disco, but only for about a minute. Though this brief glance of coherence serves as one of <i>%</i>'s most exciting moments, shortly after it, Kyle Warren's vocals come off like a unholy midpoint between Comets on Fire's echoplexed wails and Lightning Bolt's megaphone cheerleading. It's enough to momentarily jar you out of a comfort zone, but like most of <i>%</i>'s abrasive effects, it doesn't quite burn hot enough to singe.</p>
<p>There's an initially clever shift from warbly surf riffs to double-time cowpunk on ""Cage Those Pythons"", and ""Nuke Duke 'Em"" has a title as badass as its stun-gun guitar runs, but these brief glances of songwriting congruence only occasionally lift this 10-minute block from aimlessness. And ultimately, that puts a damper on what <i>%</i> could be. It's easy to gain the band's sense of sonic pranksterism, but from where does their passion derive? The Wire-y fuzz workout ""I Hate Numbers"" has an arena-sized chorus that provides a fresh wallop, but like most of the intelligible moments of <i>%</i>, it's more of a relief than anything else. ""Haze on the Mobius Strip"" tries for a similarly room-filling sound (for me it brings to mind Smashing Pumpkins' ""Porcelina of the Vast Oceans"") and eventually reaches a satisfyingly noisy climax, but the silo reverb lends too much distance for it to generate its intended impact. I'm sure it's all firecrackers live, and in their defense, Dinowalrus' populist-noise contemporaries (Liars, Oneida) needed periods of woodshedding to find their way. But I suppose it does the title justice when <i>%</i> finds a band that's not quite all there yet.</p></div>"|13977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13977-percent/|5.9|Ian Cohen

The fifth Liars album is relentlessly tense-- not so much scary as surreal. Every track is shrouded in echo and anxiety, and often all the tension erupts into bursts of buzzing guitars or pounding beats. Not every dark cloud breaks into a thunderstorm, but it constantly feels like one is lurking around the corner.</p>
<p>Despite such potential for surprise, overall <i>Sisterworld</i> isn't actually all that surprising compared to the rest of Liars' discography. For a band known for switching gears from track to track and album to album, this is the most thoroughly Liars-sounding record so far. It has the rhythmic insistence of <i>Drum's Not Dead</i>, the sleepwalking chants of <i>They Were Wrong, So We Drowned</i>, and the straightforward songwriting of <i>Liars</i>, often sounding like a streamlined update on the latter. The narrowed range brings increased depth, and it's intriguing to hear Liars focus on detail and texture rather than stylistic schizophrenia. It turns out refinement suits them as nicely as reinvention.</p>
<p>Take ""Here Comes All the People"", which the band spent a year on, crafting its basic structure in Los Angeles and adding orchestral atmospheres in Prague. None of that guarantees quality-- it's possible to make crap in both L.A. and Prague. But Liars used this elongated process to give zoomed-in attention to each moment. So the trembling guitar line, high-pitched strings, and psychotic piano all fit together, like a puzzle whose picture isn't clear until the last piece is in place. When singer Angus Andrew ends the song by chanting ""counting victims one by one,"" the killer effect comes through lethal injection rather than a loud, blunt act. That mood continues into the meditative ""Drip"", a track that's almost all atmosphere, with Andrew murmuring, ""When will I awake from this dormant sleep?"" as if he has no say in the matter.</p>
<p>Not everything on<i> Sisterworld </i>is so subdued. ""Proud Evolution"" grows into a persistent Krautrock-styled groove; the clicking ""No Barrier Fun"" has the catchy lilt of a nursery rhyme; and ""Scarecrows on a Killer Slant"" sounds like a warped version of Liars' slamming ""Plaster Casts of Everything"". Even ""Drop Dead"", a drunken march that sound ever ready to collapse, holds upbeat energy in its skewed sway. Still, the dominant mode here is creeping tension without tons of cathartic release. That tension is so well-crafted that it consistently engages, but 42 minutes of it might not completely win over every Liars fan, especially those drawn to their more raucous moments. Admittedly, some parts are easier to admire than they are to enjoy. But stick with <i>Sisterworld </i>as it builds, let it seep into your brain while you wait for its bulging seams to burst, and you might find yourself unable to turn your ears away. Eventually, Liars' commitment to their own creepy cause proves contagious.</p></div>"|13991.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13991-sisterworld/|8.1|Marc Masters

Ted Leo's got some fine instincts, and over the course of his career he's built up cred at an enviable rate. Lifers like Leo, unafraid of inserting passionate personal politics into ebullient guitar rock, don't come around too often, and few can boast a track record like his. The ease with which he synthesizes punk and its many roots and branches into something distinctly his own has only occasionally shown signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>Still, you couldn't be blamed for being a little worried about Leo's dedication in the wake of his flimsiest full-band effort to date, 2007's <i>Living With the Living</i>. <i>Living</i> had its moments, for sure, but it was an overlong, unbalanced, occasionally sluggish record, one that felt especially weary in the wake of 2004's vitriol-guided <i>Shake the Sheets</i>. It felt almost instantly like one of those long, all-over-the-place punk records you admire and namecheck but don't ever pull out; the kind of thing that's historically ushered in the sunset of a once-firebrand career.</p>
<p><i>The Brutalist Bricks</i>, the first Pharmacists LP for the increasingly punk-leaning Matador, feels like a massive corrective to <i>Living</i>'s letdowns. It runs 20 minutes shorter and has tauter, better tunes. After the bitter <i>Shake the Sheets</i> and the resigned <i>Living</i>, <i>Bricks</i> feels hopeful, purposeful, direct-- a mood helped along by the Pharmacists' most
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
impressive musical showing on wax since 2003's masterful <i>Hearts of Oak</i>. One never doubted Leo's passion, but <i>Bricks</i> finds him sounding rejuvenated, a refugee from the Bush regime poking his head above ground after lying low for <i>Living</i> and finding that now's the time to get to work.</p>
<p><i>Bricks</i> kicks off with the throat-grabbing ""The Mighty Sparrow"", and from there, the stink of shrapnel hangs in the air through the rest of the proceedings. Leo, ceasing to shout only to peel off a blistering solo, sounds plenty invigorated, but it's the Pharmacists-- new bassist Marty Key, longtime drummer Chris Wilson and jack of many trades James Canty-- who seem to be straightening Leo's spine and providing these tunes with a solid backbone. Leo's sound, so expansive in <i>The Tyranny of Distance</i> days, has been pared down further with each subsequent record, and despite a few dubby touches and a bit more acoustic guitar, <i>Bricks</i> follows that path. These tunes feel distilled to their very essence, and the first half of the record feels more like one long earworm.</p>
<p>The middle third of <i>Bricks</i> is where you'll find its best bits, none better than ""Bottled in Cork"". Leo's long been a master of the travelogue; this one details the experience of being an Jerseyite overseas through the Bush era, and providing tips on how not to come off as an American idiot. The lightly funky ""One Polaroid a Day"" finds an unusually husky Leo him bemoaning the loss of true experience to constant documentation; take note, bloggers. The more breathless ""Where Was My Brain?"" and ""Gimme the Wire"" manage to stick despite their breakneck paces, thanks to Leo's insistence here on piling hooks on top of hooks; largely gone are the long expository verses from the <i>Hearts</i>/<i>Sheets</i> era and the never-ending choruses of <i>Living</i>.</p>
<p>But in distilling everything down to their essence, some of Leo's lyrical directness comes across a bit blunt-- not all, mind but there's a distinct lean towards sandwich-board fodder rather than the carefully constructed, metaphor-laced screeds of old. Few songwriters could kick off their best tune in years with a line like ""There was a resolution pending on the United Nations floor"" without inspiring either a yawn or a giggle, but Leo does it here with ""Bottled""; he pulls it off okay, but there are a few more metaphor-eschewing moments like these where Leo goes way literal. ""We all got a job to do and we all hate God"" is how he kicks off ""Woke Up Near Chelsea"", and it reads better than it sounds on record. The otherwise lovely ""Ativan Eyes"" begins with a too-clever nod to Marx: ""The industry's out of touch. The means of production are now in the hands of the workers"" just isn't a line that belongs in a pop tune, particularly one that implores someone to lay their hands on Leo just a couple stanzas later. Leo's still exceptionally adept at saying a lot in a small space but there are more than a few lines that feel a little too forceful no matter how many times you run into them, sitting slightly askew next to the richer images and more pointed jabs here.</p>
<p>That occasional obtuseness is really the only thing keeping <i>Bricks</i> from the absolute upper-tier of Leo records; well, that, and ""Tuberculoids Arrive in Hop"", an unfocused, murky number that's serves as little more than a breather amidst the LP's hyperkinetic back end. Still, you hit play on <i>Brutalist Bricks</i> and these things seem, at best, like secondary concerns; weak spots and strained metaphors aside, the passionate, instinctual <i>Bricks</i> is the finest record from one of the greats in six rocky years.</p></div>"|13992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13992-the-brutalist-bricks/|7.9|Paul Thompson

Side projects between established solo artists tend to produce more mediocrity than magic-- even if every participant is on point, the result often lacks the kind of intuitive communication that usually takes years to establish. But on 1999's <i>Magic Sound of Fenn O'Berg </i>and 2002's <i>Return of Fenn O'Berg</i>, Viennese laptop guru Christian Fennesz, British electronic wizard Peter Rehberg, and American multi-tasker Jim O'Rourke sounded like they'd been conversing sonically for a while. The fact that both albums came from the tightrope-walk of live performance made their chemistry especially impressive.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only thing more impressive would be for that chemistry to survive a nine-year hiatus. Unfortunately, on <i>In Stereo</i> the Fenn O'Berg magic has faded. Recorded last fall in a Tokyo studio, it sounds more like the work of a project than a band. Even when things do click, there's an aura of predictability that never quite lifts, producing something that's hard to dislike but even harder to get lost in.</p>
<p>Much of that effect is due to the trio's oddly limited palette. Previous albums were kaleidoscopic, filled with everything from cinematic string samples to robotic voices to cartoonish effects. Those many surprises meant repeat visits could reveal new colors and patterns. But most of the sounds on <i>In Stereo</i>-- windy whooshes, machine-like whirrs, shortwave squiggles-- are pretty run-of-the-mill for electronic music. The trio works hard to mix them up in new ways, and they succeed at least half the time. But the incessant familiarity weighs the album down. The more I listen, the more theses pieces seem to shrink rather than expand.</p>
<p>Still, there is well-crafted sound on <i>In Stereo.</i> The title's no joke-- the trio makes good use of the stereo space, circling their sounds around each other so everyone has room to move. In ""Part V"", that 3D quality creates a busy mix, with high-pitched drones turning into underwater rumbles, rhythmic noise, and a beatific close that hints at Fennesz's best dream-scapes. Even better is ""Part VII"", which begins sharp and brittle as bed of needles, then crests into a wash of digital foam. In fact, skip around and pick a track here, a passage there, a note anywhere, and <i>In Stereo </i>sounds pretty good. But let it just play, and it slips past without much impact-- at least not the kind of impact Fenn O'Berg have made in the past.</p>
<p>Of course, it was a risk for them to resurrect this project so long after their initial triumphs. Much transpired in the intervening years, both in their respective careers and within the many sub-genres of electronic music, and the range of new things to be said has narrowed. So you have to admire them for taking on this challenge, but the ambition of the task just isn't matched by the sounds applied to it. Yet I wouldn't bet against them getting it right if they try again. Let's hope it happens, because even though <i>In Stereo </i>has its moments, they don't deserve to be Fenn O'Berg's last.</p></div>"|13998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13998-in-stereo/|6.5|Marc Masters

I first saw the group in summer 2008 as the opening act on a night Deerhunter debuted a lot of <i>Microcastle</i> material. That performance-- and Golden Triangle's chaotic stage presence-- stuck with me for some reason. I mentally tagged them as ""psychotic B-52's"" and followed along as they played a ton of other shows, many in Brooklyn warehouses, and put out a self-titled EP on Mexican Summer last year.</p>
<p><i>Double Jointer</i> is the band's first full-length, and it falls in line with the throwback garage-rock of Black Lips and King Khan, as well as the murkier scuzz-pop of Vivian Girls. The B-52's description wasn't totally accurate, but they build a ragged shimmy around co-vocalists Vashti Windish and Carly Rabalais similarly to how the Georgia group highlight Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson. Mostly though, Golden Triangle remind me of the rockabilly side of punk. While you could very easily lump them in with the current shitgaze sound, there's an added tinge of madness that brings to mind bands like Gun Club and the Cramps.</p>
<p>That's a bunch of comparisons to say that most of what you'll encounter on <i>Double Jointer</i> you've already heard in some form or another. Golden Triangle are kind of an amalgamation of many strains of rock from the past 30 years-- garage, rockabilly, punk-- but presented in a more spastic, dancier style. This could be a sticking point for some if the songs didn't work, but they're successful for the most part. The band is a six-piece, and behind singers Windish and Rabalais are four talented players, specifically guitarist OJ San Felipe, who develops oddly catchy hooks with fuzzy, asymmetrical guitar lines. Such is the case on tighter rockabilly tracks like ""I Want to Know"" and ""Death to Fame"", but the band often sounds best at their loosest. ""Jellyroll"" and ""Jinx"" have a nice herky-jerky quality to them-- almost a muddier form of doo-wop.</p>
<p>""The Melting Wall"", which comes late in the record, is arguably the best song here, and it's when Golden Triangle feel most at ease. On this one, they allow for lots of space, let the guitars rumble and growl, and have Windish and Rabalais trade vocals overtop the smoldering arrangement. And it's here that the band sounds most like they did that night in Brooklyn back in 2008. There's a spark and energy to the song that's missing from some of the others on the album, and it makes me think that, for now at least, Golden Triangle's music is still best absorbed in the live setting. These fuzzy, frenetic songs are ones you want to hear in a crowded club, bouncing along as you spill half your drink on the guy next to you. While most of <i>Double Jointer</i>'s tracks are at least good, the band doesn't tap into that spirit often enough, and ultimately it leaves the album feeling a bit flat.</p></div>"|14007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14007-double-jointer/|6.2|Joe Colly

The relatively short-lived genre ran concurrent with guitar-based post-punk and early new wave from the late 1970s to the mid 80s without enjoying the commercial success of either. Featuring the analog synthesizer as a foundation, minimal synth tracks were fleshed out with little more than a drum machine, vocals, and occasionally, a bass line. The limited sonic palette arguably enabled the ultimate DIY movement, with solo and duo minimal synth projects cropping up all across Europe.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the ubiquity of minimal synth in the European underground may have worked against its broader acceptance: the sheer number of acts made it difficult to form a consensus around its leading practitioners. Furthermore, many of the artists preferred singing in their native tongues, creating regional pockets-- in France and Belgium in particular-- as opposed to a truly pan-European movement. As a result, while minimal synth flourished on the stage, its recorded works were often consigned to regional European labels and quickly went out of print. The fragmented nature of the movement has also posed a formidable challenge to anyone hoping to offer a representative compilation.</p>
<p><i> Cold Waves</i> is not the first minimal synth retrospective, though it certainly stands as one of the best and most accessible. Assembled by Pieter Schoolwerth, founder of the Brooklyn-based Wierd Records, along with Joe Daniel of Angular, the compilation leans heavily toward DJ-friendly material. Wierd has been championing minimal synth, along with guitar-driven cold wave, since 2003, as part of its series of DJ nights in Brooklyn called Wierd Nights. Schoolwerth, meanwhile, has been an avid minimal synth collector for years, making him uniquely qualified to oversee <i>Cold Waves</i> for London label Angular.</p>
<p>The album opens with the ferocious and sinisterly assertive ""Figures"", from Belgium's Absolute Body Control. An early tone-setter, ""Figures"" portends the aggressive fare to follow, and lithe, sinewy tracks like End of Data's ""Danse Votre Monde"" and Ausgang Verboten's ""Consumer"" deliver on that promise, favoring immediacy over subtle shading. Even the few restrained and pensive tracks, like ""A Gift of Tears"", from Italy's Jeunesse d'Ivoire, remain hauntingly elemental in construction. In this respect, <i>Cold Waves</i> remains true to minimal synth's fundamental tenet of simplicity, never sacrificing raw emotion for complex arrangements.</p>
<p>While minimal synth is typically classified as a strictly European movement, two of the most arresting songs on <i>Cold Waves</i> come courtesy of North American artists. ""Watching Trees"" from New York's Eleven Pond has been a staple at Wierd Nights almost since its inception, and with its eerie, icy veneer, it's easy to hear why its become an anthem of sorts for Schoolwerth's weekly parties. Canada's Land of Giants offer the somewhat less severe but no less engrossing ""Cannibal Dolls"". The 1982 single features a playful, pinball rhythm that hints at the new wave movement that would follow even as Anya Varda's tense, strained vocal keeps it squarely within minimal synth's darkly paranoid tradition.</p>
<p>That neither song sounds out of place is fairly remarkable considering their creators were an ocean removed from the epicenter of minimal synth, even if the seamlessness also suggests that, as minimal synth compilations go, <i>Cold Wave</i>s might be a little too convenient. As other retrospectives have demonstrated, including the recent <i>Minimal Wave Tapes</i>, this music isn't as singularly focused or narrowly defined as <i>Cold Waves</i> might lead a newcomer to believe. However, as an introduction to this obscure movement, <i>Cold Waves </i>is tough to top. These songs may not have been popular in their day, but Wierd and Angular together have ensured they won't soon be forgotten.</p></div>"|13843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13843-wierd-presents-cold-waves-and-minimal-electronics-vol-1/|8.2|Jonathan Garrett

Over the past decade, their B-sides, radio sessions, and assorted rarities have been repackaged into a series of excellent reissues, which has made it easy to be a Pavement completist without blowing a lot of cash. It's all very accessible, but it's not easy to know where to start. <i>Quarantine the Past</i>, the first-ever Pavement retrospective compilation, solves this problem by providing a cheap and easy entry point to the band that represents the breadth of their songbook. The best-known songs are featured-- ""Cut Your Hair"", ""Gold Soundz"", ""Here"", ""Shady Lane"", ""Spit on a Stranger""-- but so are concert staples, fan favorites, and at least a couple of curveballs. The sequence is non-chronological, zig-zagging through the catalog and evenly distributing the obvious classics throughout the running order.</p>
<p>It's important that a Pavement best-of not only focus on their singles, which often erred on the side of novelty and levity. The dark horses here are essential in sketching out the group's range, from the punky blast of ""Unfair"" and ""Debris Slide"" to the loose, stoned sound of ""Heaven Is a Truck"". ""Grounded"" is majestic, ""Shoot the Singer"" is wistful, ""Date With Ikea"" is a suburban anthem. ""Embassy Row"" is like an alternate-universe Pavement that could compete on modern rock radio with the likes of Weezer, and ""Box Elder"" is a platonic ideal of simple, lo-fi indie pop. Fans of the band may look over the tracklisting and wonder why some of their favorites didn't make the cut, but every song on this thing is an unimpeachable gem, and the collection presents a well-rounded summary of their distinct and varied body of work.</p>
<p>Pavement were mainly a vehicle for the songwriting of Stephen Malkmus, who penned almost all of the band's material. In terms of rock archetypes, Malkmus is a true original. He's erudite but bratty, laid-back yet buttoned-up. He's an inscrutable goofball, a pragmatic romantic, an aloof charmer. His music is loaded with references to cultural history-- one of these songs is an imaginary history of R.E.M.-- but his nerdy impulses and arty affect is consistently overwhelmed by his casual coolness. There's an impossible ease and haphazard grace to this music. A lot of bands work very hard to make you appreciate their meticulous craft or browbeat you with hooks, but Pavement tossed off brilliantly composed pop songs with a shambling, carefree swagger. They made it sound easy, and maybe it was. The best kind of genius tends to come very naturally to people, like a side effect of just being themselves. In ""Frontwards"", Malkmus sings ""I've got style/ Miles and miles/ So much style that it's wasted,"" and that's pretty much him and his band in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Malkmus' lyrics, central to the band's appeal, alternate between whimsical nonsense and epigrammatic quotables. The songs seldom slot neatly into readily identifiable emotional states or refer to specific experiences, instead falling into the liminal spaces between thoughts and feelings. Malkmus' words indicate context and supply the listener with rich imagery, but the real poetry is in the way his phrases flow with the melodies, and are offset by evocative guitar textures and unexpected noises. The group never compromised tunefulness for artiness, but mystique and abstraction were among their core values. In retrospect, certain lines ring out like statements of intent-- ""We need secrets,"" ""Tricks are everything to me.""</p>
<p>The very best Pavement songs delight in curiosity and imagination, drawing connections between images and ideas as if everything in the world was full of character and significance. This is part of why, for example, a playful joke about the voice of Rush's lead singer in ""Stereo"" never gets stale. It's in the middle of a song that may as well be a sub-genre unto itself, bouncing about gleefully, utterly fascinated by the all the obscure details of the world. They found the magic in the mundane, and could make small enthusiasms, silly in-jokes, and skewed observations seem profound and glorious.</p>
<p>A decade after the band's dissolution, Pavement's music has proven itself to have an evergreen quality. To be sure, it's all very much of its time and no band aside from perhaps Guided By Voices better epitomizes the sound and style of 1990s indie rock, but the material transcends its era as much as it defines it. This compilation exists mainly to get an entry-level Pavement product on the market to coincide with their reunion tour, but it has a value beyond crass commercial necessity. Unlike other cross-generational legacy bands like the Pixies, Sonic Youth, and Talking Heads, Pavement's songs fit together comfortably as a jukebox-friendly hit parade.</p>
<p>Some tracks, like the Spiral Stairs showcase ""Date With Ikea"" and the early EP cut ""Mellow Jazz Docent"", shine brighter than in their original contexts, while numbers like ""In the Mouth a Desert"" and ""Gold Soundz"" come out sounding like modern standards. As much as their albums excel as unified works, no one ever needed to hear those records in full to fall in love with ""Cut Your Hair"", ""Shady Lane"", or ""Range Life"" on MTV, college radio, or someone's mixtape. <i>Quarantine the Past</i> doesn't replace the albums, but it's a highly listenable alternative that is as much a treat for nostalgic older fans as it is a valuable gateway for new listeners.</p></div>"|14002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14002-quarantine-the-past/|10.0|Matthew Perpetua

The Scottish group began as a trio featuring brothers Scott and Grant Hutchison and their friend Billy Kennedy, but they blossomed into a quartet during their last tour and are now a five-piece with the addition of Make Model's Gordon Skene. The band's sound has also expanded. Having made a name for themselves with raw, confessional folk-rock driven by urgent guitar interplay and brutal percussion, Frightened Rabbit have left behind their folky beginnings and given in to their loudest, most blustery impulses for their third full-length.</p>
<p><i>The Winter of Mixed Drinks</i> is definitely more sophisticated than its predecessors. From the reverberating electronic buzz that swathes album opener ""Things"" to the spoken-word samples that lie underneath the droning ""Man/Bag of Sand"", Frightened Rabbit have muddled their simple melodies with arty effects, washes of shoegaze guitars, and baroque orchestrations. Tunes meander instead of galloping ahead toward a climactic chorus. Many songs are obsessed with oceanic motifs-- starting with the escapist maritime metaphors of the shuffling single ""Swim Until You Can't See Land"" and continuing through the sailing and floating imagery of the stomping ""Living in Colour""-- and the album is likewise murky and vast. The Hutchison brothers still write rousing anthems, but the slickness of their production or the tarting-up of their simple setup makes them sound a little more like other bombastic bands from the British Isles (like Muse) and a little less like the band that made those first two albums.</p>
<p>One of the collection's best tracks, ""Not Miserable"", does manage to capture the dramatic crescendos of <i>Midnight Organ Fight</i>, but perhaps its title is a clue to <i>Mixed Drinks</i>' new sound. Frontman Scott Hutchison is, as he sings, not miserable anymore. <i>Midnight Organ Fight</i> was an account of his own terrible breakup, and though he doesn't necessarily sound happy throughout <i>Mixed Drinks</i>, he is definitely more optimistic and less heartbroken. ""I am not put-upon, I am free from disease, no grays, no liver spots, most of the misery's gone,"" he sings of his newly earned glass-is-half-full outlook. But it was more viscerally affecting to hear Scott's hangdog tales of how it's OK with him if you call out the wrong name during sex or how it takes more than fucking someone to keep warm than it is to hear him detail the frustration, purpose, or assurance of moving on and growing up. <i>Midnight Organ Fight</i> announced with its title that its underlying concern was sex (not getting it, not getting it from who you want, being unfulfilled by it), and the songs on this new album, though more lyrically complex, seem neutered by comparison.</p>

The glossy production of <i>The Winter of Mixed Drinks</i> coupled with its less personal/more universal storytelling, makes its songs seem bigger musically than their content deserves. </span></p></div>"|13983.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13983-the-winter-of-mixed-drinks/|6.6|Rebecca Raber

It takes something extraordinary to inspire someone that was there for the birth and ascendancy of Gang of Four and Wire and Public Image Limited and Joy Division and any other notable group from that scene to pen something like, ""she might have been Fac 17/or she might have sung two shows with Section 25 and once met Blue Orchids around the back of a cinema showing Existenz."" In other words, Morley's not just saying that LoneLady does a fine job mimicking her musical idols, but actually positions herself as a worthy peer to those very same groups.</p>
<p><i>Nerve Up</i> is primarily the creation of singer/guitarist Julie Campbell, a native of Manchester who shows an uncanny ability to reinvigorate a sound that was seemingly beyond saving. When she slashes a pick across her guitar strings, there's no way to avoid using a word like ""sharp"" and ""angular"" in describing what emerges, and the way she sings-- agitated, clipped, in terse fragments-- perfectly complements those sounds. Campbell also employs a drum machine; it's presumably out of necessity, but the unerring precision of the backbeat does help maintain the sharpness of <i>Nerve Up</i>'s edges. The combination of these elements gives the album a nervous, contagious energy that's evident the moment ""If Not Now"" starts, with Campbell furiously cycling through a two-note pattern on her guitar.</p>
<p>Most of the songs on <i>Nerve Up</i> follow the same template-- guitar chords are fired off, cryptic phrases are aired out (""sun threaten the horizon like a black sign""; ""said a ghost is more solid than that""), and the drum machine hits it marks. Thankfully, Campbell finds enough wiggle room in this formula to keep things from stagnating-- where ""If Not Now"" and ""Early the Haste Comes"" hit the ground running, ""Intuition"" ass

.</p>
<p>Thanks should also be directed to co-producer and former Laika member Guy Fixsen (My Bloody Valentine, Pixies, Stereolab). Fixsen adds the right amount of polish to these proceedings without overwhelming the songs-- accentuating the pish of a faux-cymbal here, adding some reverb to Campbell's voice there. These touches are so slight as to seem inconsequential, yet they prove to be invaluable. And sometimes the touches aren't so subtle-- a song like ""Immaterial"" with its charming lope and Campbell's keening vocals, would probably sound like a long lost 4AD gem (from the days of Throwing Muses and This Mortal Coil) without much trouble. The gauzy sheen that the track is given, however, is so reminiscent of that sound, it'd be hard for folks of a certain age (cough cough) to not imagine the accompanying (and undoubtedly awkward yet charming) video. I don't doubt that Fixsen also had a hand in giving the title track-- a funky pop earworm that lets Campbell stand toe-to-toe with Goldfrapp and Róisín Murphy-- a little something extra to make it truly pop.</p>
<p>And then, after nine tracks of this wonderful wall-to-wall skittishness, comes the album finale-- ""Fear No More"", a complete departure from what preceded it. It's a stark, spacious song that fills the void with a sepulchral guitar line, haunting background moans, what sounds like violin and balalaika, and Campbell singing about ""the furious winter"" and dreams of ""fields, lonely and sweet, like Montana or Idaho."" ""Fear No More""'s pensive yearning, however, is of a piece with the more up-front restlessness that permeates the majority of <i>Nerve Up</i>. Hopefully, this type of maneuver is proof that LoneLady, having shown an astonishing ability to express her voice using the sounds of others, will work extra hard to make sure she doesn't repeat herself.</p></div>"|14006.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14006-nerve-up/|7.7|David Raposa

<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's easy to compare ambient music to nature; Thomas' album title certainly isn't shying from this language (his only other full-length is entitled <i>Fearsome Jewel</i> and adorned with a macro photo of grass). <span> </span><i>Between Buildings</i>, though, conjures something more refined and fragile, like stemware or, well, the type of nice champagne you might drink out of stemware. Unlike on <i>Fearsome Jewel</i>, Thomas never saturates your speakers.<span> </span><i>Between Buildings</i> seems far more interested in dusting airspaces, sprinkling sound around a room.<span> </span>Some majorly distended tones aside, there's very little bass on <i>Between Buildings</i>, which allows Thomas' wispy pianos to rise in the mix.<span> </span>It's a style that has often seemed too pale on the <i>Pop Ambient</i> comps, but spread over nine tracks it feels light and thoughtful.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Thomas doesn't deal in monolithic movements-- perhaps they would scan <span>as</span> too intimidating, or too sturdy-- and most of the tracks on <i>Between Buildings</i> glide comfortably for four or five minutes.<span> </span>Parsing the individual compositions is a bit silly (it's difficult to imagine a situation in which you'd play just one) but Thomas' best moments usually come on the piano.<span> </span>""Above the World So High"" moves from noir-y, stumbling progressions to a quiet, cleansing hum.<span> </span>Opener ""A Dream of a Spider"" builds a rhythm out of a hesitant, near-lurch.<span> </span>""Net to Catch a Ghost"" (clearly there is a Random Ambient Track Titling App as well) is as threadbare and tender as its name suggests.<span> </span><i>Between Buildings</i> often sounds like an album on which no two sounds ever come into direct contact.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Even casual fans of ambient composition will recognize <i>Between Buildings</i>: It lacks for new methods, singular noises, or moods not relaxed and/or contemplative.<span> </span>Thomas' commitment to space, and the way his pianos and tones brush against it, makes <i>Between Buildings</i> consistently worthwhile.<span> </span>It would be wrong to say that <i>Between Buildings</i> beats this year's <i>Pop Ambient</i> installment, but only because Thomas' light drifts are coolly incapable of any action quite so forceful.</p>

Her years inform her craft but do not limit its scope. As the band-- which includes her sisters and sister-in-law-- backs her up with sympathetic arrangements built on early rock and contemporary indie pop, Cottingham expresses misgivings and uncertainties that accompany any person's search for self, no matter their age: ""I need the answers for this,"" she sings on the deceptively sunny ""Opposites"", ""but nobody knows how I'm supposed to say things when I don't even know how they go.""</p>
<p>Such concerns, especially when expressed by a young woman not old enough to drink, are sometimes dismissed as naïve and inconsequential (see also: Taylor Swift, a fine songwriter often derided for lyrics that convey a similar perspective). While Cottingham may not have settled into her songwriting voice just yet, she definitely has something to say about her own insecurities and confusions, and moreover she has a seemingly contradictory means of saying it. Ortolan's most distinctive trait may be her deeply mannered vocals, which imply that, for her, performing means indulging certain protective eccentricities. Listen to her chew on a syllable like it's a pen cap, or stretch her vowels out like taffy. There's no way to spell out her pronunciation of the pronoun ""I"" phonetically. She's not an especially powerful singer-- she doesn't have much range or force-- but Cottingham manages to convey personality in her vocals. Her tics may turn off some listeners, but they reveal a confidence that Cottingham swears she doesn't have. ""If I hit the wrong chord, please don't take offense,"" she sings on ""Mirror Image"". ""I'm doing this more, but I don't mean to do the things that I do.""</p>
<p>Despite her protestations, the music itself contains no such flubs, though it lacks the rawness of her songwriting. As produced by Smith, Ortolan can be resourceful and a bit too controlled. ""Once"" sounds like a sped-up ""Earth Angel (Will You Be Mine)"", which underscores the fairy-tale quality of the lyrics, while the rising keyboard line on ""Just Like Me"" is as much a hook as the vocal melody. Ortolan never really cut loose on <i>Time on a String</i>, which means they don't risk quite as much as Cottingham does, but they do provide a bubbly backdrop for her inner conflict, so that when her songwriting wavers-- as on ""Insist for More"", about a bratty child, or on ""Be So Bold"", about her own bookishness-- her family has her back, another protective scrim against the world. Even so, an intriguing friction between boldness and hesitation illuminates most of these songs, which makes closer ""Anything"" sound all the more triumphant when Cottingham sings, ""I'm ready for anything you give me, I'm ready for everything.""</p></div>"|13958.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13958-time-on-a-string/|6.4|Stephen M.

That night, the singer looked too embarrassed, bored, or confused to make his show at Manhattan's United Palace Theater anything more than a depressing dud. It wasn't like the album he was touring behind,  <i>Modern Guilt</i>, was exceptional, and the same could be said of his previous few LPs, too. Meanwhile, his website was a lumbering, flash-based nightmare that was successful at crashing browsers but little else. At that point, it seemed like a good idea for longtime Beck fans to cut and run.</p>
<p>But perhaps Beck was growing weary of himself around that time as well, because 2009 marked an under-the-radar creative comeback for one of the alternative era's most beloved stars. His team-up with the increasingly ineffectual Danger Mouse on <i>Modern Guilt</i> was so-so, but it apparently spurred his collaborative spirit as he went onto write and produce Charlotte Gainsbourg's surprisingly stunning <i>IRM</i>. And he completely overhauled his website, swinging his online presence from worst to damn-near first almost overnight.</p>
<p>The best feature of the new web space is <a href=""http://www.beck.com/recordclub/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Record Club</a>, which finds Beck and some (usually quite famous) friends covering an entire album in one day. Along with people like MGMT, Devendra Banhart, Nigel Godrich, and brother-in-law Giovanni Ribisi, Beck tackled the Velvet Underground &amp; Nico's 1967 debut and Leonard Cohen's 1967 bow <i>Songs of Leonard Cohen</i> via weekly videos across the second half of 2009. According to a modest disclaimer on the Record Club homepage, ""There is no intention to 'add to' the original work or attempt to recreate the power of the original recording,"" and, aside from a few flashes of offhand greatness-- usually occurring when the players took more liberties with their source material-- the covers were passable trifles. But hey, seeing Beck, MGMT, and Devendra goofing around in pixelated home movies was a lot more fun than seeing Beck halfheartedly rehash his old hits live.</p>
<p>With Record Club number three, the ante was officially upped: This time Beck wrangled Wilco, Feist, Jamie Lidell, legendary session drummer James Gadson (Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, the Jackson 5), and others to take on Skip Spence's 1969 cult favorite <i>Oar</i>. And most everyone stepped up to the task-- this is the best, most focused Record Club yet, at times transcending the project's transitory, celebrity-cover-band conceit.</p>
<p>Spence originally recorded <i>Oar</i> after a six-month stay at New York's Bellevue Hospital, where he was deemed schizophrenic. (The onetime Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape member was committed after hacking a bandmate's door down with an ax during a particularly rowdy LSD trip.) The Summer of Love hangover LP was predictably all-over-the-place-- at times funny, dark, psychedelic, folky, somber, spiritual. And, if nothing else, Beck's diverse group do an admirable job of conveying the album's infinite tangents and possibilities; their many-voiced approach could be descended straight from Spence's cracked psyche.</p>
<p>Since each song comes packaged with its own in-studio video, Record Club gives people a rare glimpse at not just an artist's sound but their creative temperament as well. With this in mind, the undoubted star of <i>Oar</i> is techno twiddler-cum-soul blower Jamie Lidell, who grabs the spotlight on two of the project's most offbeat covers and can be seen spreading merriment throughout. Locking in with Gadson, Lidell transforms folk-blues tracks ""Cripple Creek"" and ""Books of Moses"" into skeletal funk workouts while losing none of Spence's tortured soul.</p>
<p>Feist nails her lone solo vocal performance on one of  <i>Oar</i>'s more indelible tunes, the harrowing lament ""Weighted Down"". Instead of trying to match the original's heft, the crew wisely backs her with bubbly, <i>Midnite Vultures</i>-style electro-pop and a virtuosic, hummingbird-like solo from Wilco guitarist Nels Cline. And this project's finest moment is also one of the simplest; woozy strut ""All Come to Meet Her"" is stripped down to a near-<i>a cappella</i> hymn with almost everyone involved forming a half-circle around a microphone. As the voices of Beck, Jeff Tweedy, Lidell, and others blend into one, it's like hearing the imagined goal of Record Club brilliantly coming to life.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Tweedy does his best with the album's sillier songs, including innuendo-laced sex romp ""Dixie Peach Promenade"" and the skewed ""Margaret/Tiger Rug"", but not even he can make such hippie nonsense vaguely contemporary. (He fares better singing with Feist on ""Broken Heart"", which could pass for a Wilco outtake.) And then there's Beck himself, who takes lead on the least-risky covers, ""Little Hands"" and ""Diana"", and often looks more content directing traffic on the sidelines.</p>
<p>In fact, when it comes to Beck, the session's most enlightening moment is featured in a <a href=""http://videotheque.beck.com/videotheque/index.php/record-club-3-behind-the-scenes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">behind-the-scenes mini doc posted in January</a>. In it, we see Gadson and Lidell in a heady funk, grooving on ""Books of Moses"". Then the camera turns to Beck on the other side of the studio glass, debating whether to fade the jam out or let it ride. ""Let's fade it, we've got like 10 more songs to do,"" he says-- a disappointing-yet-logical choice indicative of his latter-day mien. Then he just stands there, smiling and nodding for a few more seconds. ""I hate killing it-- let's fade it back up,"" he tells the engineer, laughing. He's not ready to call it quits just yet.</p></div>"|13997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13997-oar/|6.9|Ryan Dombal

Their breakthrough album, <i>Sea Lion</i>, dropped in the early spring of 2008; it was a fun, loose take on Panda Bear's seaside psychedelia. Last summer, many indie fans fell hard for a smattering of artists-- Washed Out, Neon Indian-- that echoed the same big-wave aesthetic as the Suns. Justice would see head Sun Ryan McPhun return to claim a spot at the picnic table, but <i>Fight Softly</i> mostly abandons the gentle soufulness and playful strums of <i>Sea Lion</i> in favor of stale electronics and busy loops.</p>
<p>The departure from <i>Sea Lion</i> is apparent immediately: Twinkling ambience and dollops of synthesizer open <i>Fight Softly</i>. The rhythms remain bouncy and ebullient, but simple, slapping drum machines weigh them down. The Suns used to sneak in bits of odd percussion and puns on world music (""Kenya Dig It?""), but McPhun's sound design is unable to harness that kind of nuance and adventure. The resulting compositions seem full of color but lacking in depth or space: drum thwacks and buzzing keyboards caulk every track.</p>
<p>McPhun has taken to singing with melisma, twisting simple lyrics into meandering phrasings. He takes almost 30 seconds to sing the album's first line: ""It's my turn in the front seat"" (many of his lyrics address this sort of innocence and alienation). At his best, like on ""Closet Astrologer"", he recalls Arthur Russell's awkward, thrilling navigation, but McPhun often lacks Russell's coy balance.</p>
<p>McPhun's voice seems incongruous with his songwriting. He seems languid and relaxed over ""Cinco""'s aggressive shifts. On album closer ""Olympics on Pot"", he idles over sweet, furtive drumming. (For those of you who cried foul about Animal Collective lyrics like those in ""My Girls"": sharpen your knives.) ""How Kids Fail"" is almost oppressively anthemic, its huge keyboard stabs weighing down one of the album's better verses. ""Cranberry"" inexplicably shifts from a charging, abstract march to a plodding pop song to a rummy party jam. <i>Fight Softly</i> constantly jars and pivots, but with little purpose.</p>
<p>Animal Collective remain the obvious sonic touchstone for the Ruby Suns-- damn if ""Dusty Fruit"" doesn't sound like a diet version of ""Brother Sport""-- but McPhun's best work exhibits a surprisingly formalist synth-pop streak. ""Haunted House""'s bouncing pads and treated vocal samples sound like a pillowy Cut Copy. The penultimate ""Two Humans"" is a delicate love ballad-- ""When are you leaving?/ And will you stay the night""-- that sounds like the Junior Boys on vacation. ""Closet Astrologer"" is a paean to introverts that tries to parse young adulthood (""I'll find time to do what I want/ Whatever that is"").</p>
<p>These moments aren't indicative of <i>Fight Softly</i>'s general tenor, though. The album sits heavily, uneasily, even when its mood is light. It's a true departure in sound and method; this is not a lazy or complacent record. McPhun, though, never settles into these new sounds, and <i>Fight Softly</i> retains very little of the ease and abandon that, to date, had marked the Ruby Suns.</p></div>"|13969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13969-fight-softly/|6.1|Andrew Gaerig

Dropping a breakup album for your first LP seems a risky move. Listeners are just starting to get to know you, after all. But considering his last solo outing, the scrappy song-sketch collection <i>The Josiah EP</i>, was self-released all the way back in 2003, maybe he had to make this record at this time. If only to get it out of his system.</p>
<p><i>Jet Lag</i> indeed has its share of emotional baggage, although it's hard to tell if it's getting unloaded, or simply re-packed for a later trip. These songs are filled with observations, open-ended questions, and musings on post-breakup life, but with little resolution. ""The New Car"" revolves around the purchase of a vehicle to ""help with the separation,"" detailing a failed attempt to pawn a mattress as well before Wolf sighs, ""But when you told me/ That I wasted your twenties/ I didn't know what to say."" Meanwhile, ""Unused 'I love you's build up"" in his throat in the somewhat cornily named ""The Apart Meant"", after expressing the lonely sentiment that ""For 11 years/ We didn't touch another/ And now I can't sleep,"" in ""Skull in the Ice"".</p>
<p>Lyrically, Wolf is convincing when sticking to the grief-stricken script. It's when he goes off-book that things start to get awkward. ""Master Cleanse (California)"" and ""The Opposite of Breathing"" opt for a wide-eyed and spiritual tone, but their offbeat musings on praying naked in the shower and waiting for ""Thomas Edison/ With seven heads/ To come from the sea"" sound forced. Later, attempts at surrealism, like the adolescent wet dreaming detailed in ""That Kind of Man"", stumble out of the gate and suggest that Wolf doesn't share his brother's talent for crafting absurdist yarns that hold a weird car-crash fascination.</p>
<p>If Wolf could be accused of lyrical overcompensation, the opposite could be said about the music. ""The Opposite of Breathing"" and ""The New Car"" represent the sort of competent but dull chamber-pop that litters much of the record, where the jammed-together folksy melodies of ""In the Seam"" and ""The Apart Meant"" sound less like actual songs and more like half-decent ideas haphazardly grouped together. Listeners coming to <i>Jet Lag</i> expecting the bizarre pop mutations of WHY?'s 2008 career-high <i>Alopecia</i>-- or even its more straightforward cousin, last year's <i>Eskimo Snow</i>-- are going to be disappointed. Wearing your heart on your sleeve is one thing, but musically, Josiah Wolf isn't really taking any risks here.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Wolf's anguish comes over as real and consuming, and <i>Jet Lag</i>'s highlights offer an occasionally compelling look at his darkened mindset. Opener ""The Trailer and the Truck"" stretches and yawns via elongated guitar bends and bursts of concentrated drumming, while ""Is the Body Hung"" rolls with freak-folk touches and Wolf's cracked vocals. Most affecting, however, is the spooked folk closer ""The One Sign"", in which Wolf likens a plane crash to the slow dread of uncertainty, before uttering a final epitaph: ""'Heaven help me' are just words/ That time will make you say."" Time heals all wounds, sure. If and when Josiah Wolf decides to make another record, here's hoping he'll be newly restored by then.</p></div>"|13953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13953-jet-lag/|5.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

Tipped in January as the sound of 2010 in two tastemaker polls, she's received distinctly underwhelmed reviews now her album has been released. It's an odd record to have been caught in the crossfire: There's no high concept or big personality, it doesn't ride any particular fashion wave or nostalgia agenda. Instead critics have seized upon a sense of contrivance, the idea that UK pop culture is meme-splicing from the recent past, and that Goulding has been cynically designed to hitch the nu-folk fad of 2008 (Laura Marling) to the 1980s pop vogue of last year (Little Boots) and achieve full-spectrum media approval from <i>Mojo</i> to Popjustice. And so she's getting shot by both sides: not folky enough for purists, not sensational enough for the pop crowd, but mid-market, middlebrow-- the new Dido.</p>
<p>If she'd been born Else Goldsdottir, and hailed from Helsinki rather than Hereford, Goulding probably wouldn't have these problems. Maybe it's because ABBA started out in folk groups, but the Scandinavians seem more comfortable with the idea of a confessional pop that marries immediacy with intimacy. Goulding would fit in perfectly alongside Lykke Li, Jenny Wilson, even Robyn.</p>
<p>Outside of its immediate context, <i>Lights</i> is a sometimes great, always promising debut. It's an album about leaving home, and it works best when the contrast between the folk singer and the pop production chimes with the tensions between the pull of home and the allure of the city. ""Guns and Horses"" may be the best opening invitation for travel since ""Two Divided by Zero"" kicked off the Pet Shop Boys' <i>Please</i>: ""Let's join forces, we've got our guns and horses...."" It builds from spare acoustics to urgent trance pop-- ""I left my house, left my clothes, door widen open, heaven knows, but you're so worth it, you are...""-- concluding with a desperate <i>a cappella</i> coda, and a brief breathless chuckle at her casual audacity.</p>
<p>""Wish I Stayed"" is apparently the first song that Goulding emailed to Vincent Frank (aka Frankmusik, south London's bedroom pop auteur) as an acoustic songwriter. It's still the song that best captures the tensions of <i>Lights</i>, with<i> </i>Goulding singing of ""skipping ropes, trampolines"" and crafty schoolgirl smokes. It's reminiscent of the suburban pop of the Sundays (if they'd had an electro makeover like their forbears Everything But the Girl)-- the details of small lives and sitting room triumphs, the low horizons and ""the carelessness of running away.""</p>
<p><i>Lights</i> is mostly produced by Frank's protégé Starsmith, and he does a largely good job, notably on the euphoric e-rush of ""Starry Eyed"" and ""Under the Sheets"", a grand, almost Björkian hyperballad. On the negative side, ""The Writer"" is a big bluster of a song, with a chorus where the spectre of the Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan is all too vivid, whose future success could be Goulding's undoing. The cheap tinsel backing track to ""I'll Hold My Breath"" is reminiscent of Wham!'s ""Last Christmas"", while ""Your Biggest Mistake"" could be a Frankmusik cast-off.</p>
<p>But at its best <i>Lights</i> feels remarkably uncontrived, cantering across genres, following personal whims and visions rather than marketing agendas. Unusually for a British pop debut album, it doesn't seem desperate for the immediate approval of chart success. You get the feeling Goulding could write another album or two (after <i>Lights</i>, <i>Cameras</i>, and then <i>Action</i>) before she really gets going, becoming the sound of 2012 or 2015 or whenever. Whether the UK pop industry has the patience to bear with her remains to be seen.</p></div>"|13995.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13995-lights/|6.8|Stephen Troussé

Or more specifically, given that these guys are known to shout themselves out like rappers, and lead singer Johnny Whitney runs his own fashion line (the new LP also comes with a limited edition wristband for folks who pre-ordered), it's probably better explained as a rebranding. Whitney became increasingly fond of writing songs on a drum machine, which led to the release of drummer Jay Clark, and Whitney and Cody Votolato (both formerly of the Blood Brothers) reappeared as a duo with more of a dance flavor and switched labels from Matador to Fat Possum.</p>
<p><i>Take Me to the Sea</i> is still a good record, but its uniquely psychotic fusion of hardcore, heavy metal, glam, electro, and kitsch was also Jaguar Love's central problem: It's highly combustible and can't last forever.  Instead of blowing up and starting over, however, Whitney and Votolato opted to slim down the band's concept along with its ranks. As an unfortunate side effect, they've more or less drained everything vital and exciting out of the first album, and replaced those ingredients with generic equivalents. <i>Hologram Jams</i> (that title remind you of <i>Oracular Spectacular</i> or <i>Robotique Majestique</i>?) is a vastly inferior record to <i>Sea</i>, replacing the dynamic punk psychedelia of their debut with sugary overstimulation and rank nostalgia.</p>
<p>There's no better encapsulation of the record's overall tone than ""Everything Is Awesome"", which fleshes out a sentiment fit for a puffy sticker at the top of a fifth grader's A+ paper with exhortations like ""you are the ultra-star"" and ""you're glowing in the dark"" over boilerplate dance-rock signifiers. On the whole, the first three-quarters of <i>Jams</i> is more or less a list of stuff that the band thinks is totally rad: drinking 40s, ""Immigrant Song"", staying up all night, starting fires, cherry soda, puking up said cherry soda on the lawn after a party, riding a ""motherfucking mastodon,"" graveyards. Like the title, these things aren't just annoyingly deployed in the manner of a 15-year-old's Facebook page, they feel target marketed, a strategically laid-out shop window display devoted to spazzy youthful dumbassery. The music follows suit: For a conceit so superficially high-energy, the dirty repetitiousness of the synths, drum machines, and modern-rock guitars are stunningly bland and repetitious. This until the shock of recognition of the album's last song, which, yes, is a cover of ""Piece of My Heart"". Which... no. At best, the cover is a bad aesthetic choice rendered unimaginatively.  At worst, it feels like a cheap attempt to manufacture a show-closing sing-along that appeals across demographics.</p>
<p>The stylistic shifts on <i>Jam</i> suggest that Jaguar Love know exactly what they're doing and why they're doing it, even if the new direction isn't a step forward. And though you could argue that Jaguar Love have succeeded in making their music register on a physical level, the primary sensation I'm getting here is exhaustion, and not the fun kind. The deeper and longer I immerse myself within their nihilistic high-fructose corn syrup soundworld-- ""Sugar-coated cherry soda/ It's like the future's over""-- the more I want to crash on the couch with a bad headache.</p></div>"|13959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13959-hologram-jams/|2.0|Eric Harvey

FlyLo called it ""timeless, incredible filth,"" which reads more laudatory than descriptive, but there's something about that voice that escapes simple specifics. On ""Testament"", Gonajsufi lost himself in the track's wispy, ghostlike soul, but on earlier self-pressed records like <i>Dead Midget on Stilts (Crutches) </i>and <i>Flamingo Gimpp </i>(released under the name Sumach), his voice had a gruff, restless quality. His singing can sound raw, maybe a bit off, but his ability to pull off a frail falsetto and ragged rasp in equal measures gives him a serious depth of range.</p>
<p>In pairing with L.A. producer Gaslamp Killer, Gonjasufi has found a powerful outlet for his otherworldly strain of singing. Together they've created <i>A Sufi and a Killer</i>, one of the most fascinating slabs of hallucinogenic head-nod music to arise from Southern California's post-hip-hop vanguard. Unlike the digital bleeps and squelches of SoCal contemporaries FlyLo and Nosaj Thing, however, Gaslamp Killer and Gonjasufi draw from their hip-hop background to create an LP that could as easily fit on the Stones Throw roster as well as it does IDM-centric Warp. The beats knock, but for every moment of b-boy-friendly atmosphere, there's another moment-- or a simultaneous one-- that makes like 21st century acid rock.</p>
<p>Gonjasufi's vocals are both haunting and haunted, coolly assertive yet frequently fixated on mortal matters, and they bleed vividly through Gaslamp's corroded analog wall of zero-fi psychedelic noise. The results are stark: Brooding, bad-trip laments (""Kobwebz""), a doo-wop number punctuated by spacey twang (""Duet""), a warping of the blues (""Ageing""). Even the more straightforward stuff has a grimy quality to it, particularly the heavy soul of ""Change"", the bar-jazz tension of ""Advice"", and the woozy ""Kowboys &amp; Indians"" with its Eastern vocals looped against a rust-covered revision of club rap beats circa 2003. A couple of previously issued tracks helmed by other L.A. producers sneak into Gaslamp Killer's showcase as well: Warp 2010 comp selection ""Ancestors"" maintains the psychedelic mood with a sitar-driven Flying Lotus boom-clap, while both sides of last year's Mainframe-produced ""Holidays""/""Candylane"" single contribute mini-Casio chirpiness and roller-rink funk. Even with the additional producers and the stylistic elasticity, it all coheres nicely.</p>
<p>And if the production on <i>A Sufi and a Killer </i>proves anything, it's that Gonjasufi can stitch himself into the beat whether it's a heavy banger or a quiet ballad. ""Sheep"" is the most notable example of the latter, as well as a testament to both the singer and the producer's ability to salvage a potentially corny concept: The lyrics are a vague and contradictory metaphor about wanting to be a sheep instead of a lion, but Gonjasufi sells it expertly with a fragile, subtly harmonic multi-tracked voice. And in the more impassioned moments-- ""She Gone"", ""DedNd"", ""Stardustin""-- his off-kilter wail pushes an already surreal junkshop-rock aesthetic into a kinship with <i>Safe as Milk</i>-era Captain Beefheart. There are plenty of times where the mix renders the exact words elusive and indistinct, and a track or two where you might wish they'd stay that way, but the meaning comes clear enough. And what the words don't hold, that incredible, filthy timbre does.</p></div>"|13968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13968-a-sufi-and-a-killer/|8.4|Nate Patrin

In 2004, the Whigs weren't short of either.  At the time, Parker Gispert, Hank Sullivant, and Julian Dorio were enrolled at University of Georgia in Athens, the same town that spawned the quintessential college rock band, R.E.M. Like Athens' most famous sons, the unsigned Whigs separated themselves from their peers early on, courting an audience well beyond the campus gates. Their headlining shows in Atlanta were almost always packed-- and not just with weekenders from fraternity row. Watching the Whigs in those early days, it was easy to understand the appeal. The band's jangly, Southern brand of indie rock was never especially novel, but their rare combination of power and raw, naïve energy ensured that their sets were always pushed to the brink without ever spilling over.</p>
<p><i>In the Dark</i>, the band's third full-length album, arrives in record store six years after those electrifying local shows, though it sounds several lifetimes removed. There is good reason for the difference as the Whigs are, in fact, no longer the same band. Founding member and co-songwriter Hank Sullivant parted ways with the Whigs following their first ATO effort, <i>Mission Control</i>. (He joined MGMT and was subsequently replaced with Tim Deaux.) It's hard to say for sure how much his loss influenced the direction of <i>Dark</i> or whether this album was always part of their plan. Either way, it's a dreary, dispiriting development. <i>Dark</i> is technically flawless but wholly sterile, like a Whigs album as conceived and executed by Hollywood session musicians on an especially short leash.</p>
<p>The band claims their arena tour with Kings of Leon strongly influenced <i>Dark</i>, and it's hard to argue on the evidence. The songs are uniformly brawny, loud, and cheaply anthemic without much variation, let alone personality. ""Someone's Daughter"", with its plodding jackhammer drums, could even pass for a distant cousin to ""Crawl"", with Gispert creepily wailing, ""How could I forget that she is someone's daughter?"" The Whigs have also abandoned the breezy Southern charms that characterized their early music for the geographically non-specific, leaving only vague, empty signifiers-- a hint of drawl here (""I Am For Real""), a fleeting twang there (the opening bar to ""Kill Me Carolyne""). Because of this generic approach, the Whigs' rare attempts to inject some character sound even more incongruous, such as the pealing feedback that crashes the title track's bloodless alt-rock.</p>
<p>While the songs certainly do the Whigs no favors, the production and mixing on <i>Dark</i> are downright unconscionable, making one long for the relative restraint of Don Gilmore or Andy Wallace. Gispert's weathered rasp was always the Whigs' distinctive trait; throughout <i>Dark</i>, however, his voice is so muffled and smoothed that it barely registers. And while no one would dispute that Julian Dorio is a superb and technically gifted drummer, <i>Dark</i> seems designed to convince an army of imaginary skeptics, with each snare hit ratcheted up to a comically absurd level. <i>Dark</i> is processed to the point of pasteurization, a record that conjures images of mixing desks and vocal booths as opposed to beer-soaked stages. They may no longer be amateurs, but with <i>Dark</i>, the Whigs prove that professionalism has its own perils.</p></div>"|13894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13894-in-the-dark/|3.6|Jonathan Garrett

With no qualifications except a keyboard and an Internet connection, anyone can publish simple thoughts on complex ideas for all the world to read. Now that we're instantly able to procure so much data and to proffer so many notions, editing and restraint seem to be slipping more and more out of fashion. Content is a matter of quantity, not quality or precision. Announcing overwhelms analyzing. After all, if everyone is talking, why not say everything you think, as emphatically as possible, and see what sticks? I tweet. I know how it goes.</p>
<p>That's what's most surprising about <i>Constellations</i>, the fourth album by Austin instrumental ensemble Balmorhea. Instead of going for the quick cinch or the grand statement, the quintet focuses its sound. Eschewing the need for frequent climaxes, Balmorhea practice patience across the group's most satisfying LP to date. <i>Constellations</i> begs for more rather than delivering all of the goods all of the time. Perhaps that's an old-fashioned concept-- demanding the sort of patience and attention that technology's made obsolete. But at this point, it's exactly the move Balmorhea needed to make.</p>
<p>In retrospect, Balmorhea's first three albums seem packed with enthusiasm, each new track presenting another of the band's ideas. On 2008's <i>Rivers Arms</i>, Balmorhea-- then a duo of multi-instrumentalists Michael Muller and Rob Lowe, recording with a guest string section and guitarist-- paired acoustic miniatures and grand piano anthems with <i>musique concrète</i> foundations and electroacoustic experiments. By the time Balmorhea recorded 2009's <i>All Is Wild, All Is Silent</i>, they'd assembled a full band with drums, banjo, upright bass, more strings, and more guitars. They put the sextet to heavy-handed use: Many tracks employed a combination of marching drums, strident violins, group shout-alongs, and aggressive guitar strums. As involving as those records are, they're also a bit exhausting, so busy that they're better suited for quick bursts than obsessive spins.</p>
<p><i>Constellations</i>,
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
however, is the sort of record you'd like to call home-- fitting since, after albums themed with water and land, it's their attempt to describe the cosmos with sound. The band's most concise record to date, <i>Constellations</i> never overreaches or demands attention. Its rich textures push it past the point of background music, and its gorgeous melodies serve as anchors for even the sparest moments. Opener ""To the Order of Night"" does both, setting a gentle piano theme adrift in a wide, reverb-warped atmosphere. Space and silence are paramount throughout. ""Bowsprit"" might have the biggest build here, but it depends as much on rests as it does on note. An acoustic guitar introduces the tune, stopping and starting frequently. The violin that glides in and out is as interesting when it exits as when it enters.</p>
<p>Nowhere is Balmorhea's newfound temperance more surprising and exciting than ""On the Weight of Night"", a track whose title suggests a crescendo worthy of Texas brethren Explosions in the Sky. Balmorhea expand their toolkit here with slowly walking electric bass, winding organ sustains, and a drum kit that ambles and teeters. Sonically, the track suggests Sigur Rós' ""Untitled 7"", a 13-minute epic from <i>()</i>. Sigur Rós used these same sounds as a launching pad, leaping into loudness and drama; Balmorhea may have headed in the same direction two years ago, rushing to a climax that's already been mastered. Here, they control the impulse, using the low, lingering tones and a deliberate drum pattern to test the limits of the ceiling, not punch their way through it. They sustain the feeling through closer ""Palestrina"", an ingenuous epilogue that uses bowed cymbals, long violin tones, and sweeping, resonant guitar chords to translate what Christian Fennesz does with a computer to a full band. For Balmorhea, a group that's carefully restrained and edited itself here despite every trend that demands otherwise, it's a perfectly human closing gesture.</p></div>"|13990.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13990-constellations/|7.9|Grayson Currin

From Jóhann Jóhannsson's <i>Englabörn </i>to Erik Enocksson's <i>Man Tänker Sitt</i>, they often contain similar ingredients-- gothic strings, terse pianos, haunting vocals, and a melancholy atmosphere. But due to the format and the potency of the style, you can actually get away with making some very slight music. At minimum, you have to write only one memorable, stirring theme. Record it in a string-led arrangement, and again in a piano-led one. Stash allusions to it in a bunch of filler drone you use to glue things together and, <i>voila</i>, you're done.</p>
<p>But on <i>Draumalandid</i>, a soundtrack for a new Icelandic environmental documentary, Valgeir Sigurðsson goes the extra mile to produce work that stands up against the best of its genre. He lays the requisite foundations in place, with a palette of classical instrumentation and severe electronics. The powerful title motif he concocts for strings on ""Dreamland"" is reprised on ""Draumaland"", now scored for mercurial pianos wrapped in wheezing pump organ. But Sigurðsson isn't content to let his themes just sit there; he works them through a variety of mutations, climaxes, false endings, and codas. A bevy of collaborators, culled from Sigurðsson's own Bedroom Community label, inject their personalities and prevent the album from being stylistically monolithic.</p>
<p>Sigurðsson has an illustrious career as a producer and engineer. He's worked with Björk on numerous albums, plus CocoRosie, Ben Frost, Sam Amidon, Will Oldham, and Nico Muhly. His first and only solo LP to date, 2007's <i>Ekvílibríum</i>, predicted the magisterial classical/electronic style he explores here. But as a producer first, he knows how to use his collaborators effectively. Amidon and Muhly appear on opener ""Grylukvæði"", the best and most distinct track here. Amidon has one of the most inviting voices around today, and his Icelandic folk song, flecked with banjo, sounds wonderful, glinting through a rich haze of strings and crackling with space-transmission interference. And Ben Frost threads subliminal disturbances through the Death Star strings of closer ""Helter Smelter"".</p>
<p>But most of the record's success stems from Sigurðsson's commitment to making the music a drama unto itself, not just a supplement for existing drama. In the final minute of ""Dreamland"", a simple 4/4 thwack appears, but it does wonders, turning the stately dirge into a desperate march. ""Past Tundra"" seems like it's going to be pleasant but nondescript, until the mighty bass chords kick in, the string section starts to cook, and the piece veers off on a warpath you'd have never predicted from its beginnings. There are other gradations of tone, some effective (""Beyond the Moss"", where stripes of melody lick out of loose, jazzy clutter), some less so (a trio of brief, negligible interstitials in the middle of the album). But overall, <i>Draumalandid </i>is an excellent addition to my growing collection of music for movies and plays I'll probably never actually see.</p></div>"|13976.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13976-draumalandid/|7.3|Brian Howe

Soundway's <i>Nigeria Special </i>series has found some remarkable stuff in the crates, mostly from what was happening elsewhere in Nigerian music in the 1970s; this fifth volume turns its attention to Afrobeat proper, and that means grappling directly with Fela's legacy.</p>
<p><i>Nigeria Afrobeat Special</i> kicks off with an actual Fela Ransome Kuti &amp; His Africa 70 recording: The single version of ""Who're You"", from 1971. It's an extraordinary record-- as promised, it's a harder, brasher take than the more familiar one from <i>Fela's London Scene</i>, a crazily taut, rubbery rhythm whose lyric is Fela snapping back against old-timers who didn't get his new thing. It's also the best thing on <i>Afrobeat Special</i> by a significant margin-- tight, cleverly constructed, and rhythmically on-point in the way that not much else here is.</p>
<p>That's fine if you're a Felaphile: One way to understand the impact of a major pop artist is to listen to the people who ripped them off, and figure out which parts of their work caught on with their peers. (The recent <i>Black Man's Cry: The Inspiration of Fela Kuti</i> compilation of international Fela covers and impersonations is enthusiastically recommended to anyone who thinks they might enjoy hearing three consecutive steel band covers of the same Fela tune.) <i>Nigeria Afrobeat Special</i> focuses on obscurities rather than hits; apparently, even third-rate Nigerian bands' drummers in those days were pretty great. The slowly bubbling instrumental ""Gbomojo"", by Segun Bucknor's Revolution, is like a Silly Putty impression of Africa 70, but it's not bad in its own right. Eric Showboy Akaeze &amp; His Royal Erico's ""We Dey Find Money"" suggests that he'd figured out that Afrobeat songs were supposed to be long and include some horn parts and keyboard solos, but that he hadn't picked up on how to structure one so that it stayed interesting for ten minutes, or worked out how to keep his band playing at a consistent tempo.</p>
<p>A lot of the artists here were dance bands first and foremost-- calypso, highlife, whatever moved the crowd-- and in the early 70s, Nigerian clubgoers wanted to hear Afrobeat. Saxon Lee &amp; the Shadows International, whose 1973 ""Mind Your Business"" is the second-catchiest tune here, were a long-running act who glommed onto Fela's grooves the way American funk groups shifted into disco a few years later. There are touches of American funk here, too: The hop-and-stomp intro of Anansa Professionals' ""Enwan"" could be a Charles Wright &amp; the Watts 103rd St. Rhythm riff.</p>
<p>In some ways, Fela is to Afrobeat what Bob Marley is to reggae: The outsize figurehead who frustrates serious fans by being the genre's alpha and omega to musical tourists, the father of an ongoing bloodline and franchise. There was more to 70s Nigerian pop than Afrobeat-- the earlier volumes of <i>Nigeria Special</i> have made that clear. But all the evidence from this reissue, as with others in the last decade or so, is that Fela and his immediate circle really did have a lock on the best of the form he invented.</p></div>"|13978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13978-nigeria-afrobeat-special-the-new-explosive-sound-in-1970s-nigeria/|6.1|Douglas Wolk

But like their new approach to cover art-- once muted and minimal; here a spectrum of vivid color-- the National's Bryce Dessner and co. have crafted a new version of Clogs that revels in pushing boundaries and redefining their sound.</p>
<p><i>Veil Waltz</i> does offer one clue: New song ""On the Edge"", which stands out thanks to a vocal turn by  My Brightest Diamond's Shara Worden. Effortlessly soaring and trilling above mandola, oboe, and vibraphone, here she's nearly unrecognizable, and the track serves as a striking departure from what both Worden and Clogs are best known for. The rest of that EP finds leader Padma Newsome, Dessner, percussionist Thomast Kozumplik, and bassoonist Rachael Elliot collecting songs they contributed to two film soundtracks-- <i>Turn the River</i>, a low-budget drama directed by Whit Stillman regular Chris Eigeman, and <i>Colony</i>, a documentary about bees. The music on this EP-- from the xylophone lullaby ""Turn 13"" to the mumbled rustic gypsy-folk on ""Parallel Man""-- is lovely, even if some songs cover well-worn orchestral post-rock ground.</p>
<p>Even keeping ""On the Edge"" in mind, however, won't prepare you for <i>The Creatures in the Garden of Lady Walton</i> opener ""Cocodrillo"", an <i>a cappella</i> performance by co-vocalists Worden and Newsome. ""These are the creatures in Lady Walton's garden,"" they intone, round-robin style, while also singing the Italian names of various animals (""cocodrillo,"" ""rana,"" ""pappagallo"") in a seemingly onomatopoetic fashion. Composed-- like every song here-- by Newsome, it's a marvel of composition and production, the way the song stacks their voices as each ""animal"" enters the fray, the cacophony mimicking the sounds of a vibrant jungle. Then, just as skillfully, these voices are removed one at a time, returning the song to its starting point. It's a perfect litmus test for potential <i>Lady Walton</i> listeners, regardless of one's familiarity with Clogs' previous works: By its conclusion, you'll either think this is the most pretentious nonsense in the world, or you'll be taken by its romantic grandeur.</p>
<p>Even if the conceit rubs you wrong, <i>Lady Walton</i> contains the most accomplished and varied music Clogs have recorded to date. ""Cocodrillo"" is right at home beside a Baroque waltz like ""The Owl of Love"", and Newsome's Nick-Drake-like vocal turn on ""Red Seas"" can comfortably share space with ""Last Song"", which feature the National's Matt Berninger on vocals. Despite the exposure that Sufjan Stevens' appearance on <i>Lady Walton</i> has gotten, fans coming strictly for his contributions might feel slighted, as his input is limited to some singing and banjo strumming on the album's elegiac closing track, ""We Were Here"". Those coming for a Shara Worden fix, on the other hand, will not be left wanting.</p>
<p>It's fitting that promo pics of the band include Worden, as she's on over half the tracks on <i>Lady Walton</i>, and whether she's making a grand gesture on ""The Owl of Love"" or simply lending her voice to the firmament as on ""Raise the Flag"", her contributions are an indelible part of what makes this album work. Some might take issue with her grandiose vocalizing, or perhaps with the words Newsome has her singing. Newsome's lyrics, however, are endemic of the passion that informs and emboldens <i>Lady Walton</i>.

But like their new approach to cover art-- once muted and minimal; here a spectrum of vivid color-- the National's Bryce Dessner and co. have crafted a new version of Clogs that revels in pushing boundaries and redefining their sound.</p>
<p><i>Veil Waltz</i> does offer one clue: New song ""On the Edge"", which stands out thanks to a vocal turn by  My Brightest Diamond's Shara Worden. Effortlessly soaring and trilling above mandola, oboe, and vibraphone, here she's nearly unrecognizable, and the track serves as a striking departure from what both Worden and Clogs are best known for. The rest of that EP finds leader Padma Newsome, Dessner, percussionist Thomast Kozumplik, and bassoonist Rachael Elliot collecting songs they contributed to two film soundtracks-- <i>Turn the River</i>, a low-budget drama directed by Whit Stillman regular Chris Eigeman, and <i>Colony</i>, a documentary about bees. The music on this EP-- from the xylophone lullaby ""Turn 13"" to the mumbled rustic gypsy-folk on ""Parallel Man""-- is lovely, even if some songs cover well-worn orchestral post-rock ground.</p>
<p>Even keeping ""On the Edge"" in mind, however, won't prepare you for <i>The Creatures in the Garden of Lady Walton</i> opener ""Cocodrillo"", an <i>a cappella</i> performance by co-vocalists Worden and Newsome. ""These are the creatures in Lady Walton's garden,"" they intone, round-robin style, while also singing the Italian names of various animals (""cocodrillo,"" ""rana,"" ""pappagallo"") in a seemingly onomatopoetic fashion. Composed-- like every song here-- by Newsome, it's a marvel of composition and production, the way the song stacks their voices as each ""animal"" enters the fray, the cacophony mimicking the sounds of a vibrant jungle. Then, just as skillfully, these voices are removed one at a time, returning the song to its starting point. It's a perfect litmus test for potential <i>Lady Walton</i> listeners, regardless of one's familiarity with Clogs' previous works: By its conclusion, you'll either think this is the most pretentious nonsense in the world, or you'll be taken by its romantic grandeur.</p>
<p>Even if the conceit rubs you wrong, <i>Lady Walton</i> contains the most accomplished and varied music Clogs have recorded to date. ""Cocodrillo"" is right at home beside a Baroque waltz like ""The Owl of Love"", and Newsome's Nick-Drake-like vocal turn on ""Red Seas"" can comfortably share space with ""Last Song"", which feature the National's Matt Berninger on vocals. Despite the exposure that Sufjan Stevens' appearance on <i>Lady Walton</i> has gotten, fans coming strictly for his contributions might feel slighted, as his input is limited to some singing and banjo strumming on the album's elegiac closing track, ""We Were Here"". Those coming for a Shara Worden fix, on the other hand, will not be left wanting.</p>
<p>It's fitting that promo pics of the band include Worden, as she's on over half the tracks on <i>Lady Walton</i>, and whether she's making a grand gesture on ""The Owl of Love"" or simply lending her voice to the firmament as on ""Raise the Flag"", her contributions are an indelible part of what makes this album work. Some might take issue with her grandiose vocalizing, or perhaps with the words Newsome has her singing. Newsome's lyrics, however, are endemic of the passion that informs and emboldens <i>Lady Walton</i>. It's the same passion that National fans see during the band's live shows, as Newsome careens about the stage, furiously bowing his viola as if he means to saw the thing in half. It's a willingness to look the fool while doing what you love most, to follow your muse wherever it leads and trust its guidance.</p></div>"|13989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13989-the-creatures-in-the-garden-of-lady-walton-veil-waltz-ep/|7.1|David Raposa

I do, and if it weren't for the spinal tap and blood patch procedures that followed, it would probably be the most painful experience in my life. Rogue Wave singer/guitarist Zach Rogue suffered two slipped discs in his neck, essentially rendering him paralyzed for a span of months. When his condition improved and the songwriting muse began to call again, like many who've been laid up for a significant time, it seems like he just wanted his life back: Rogue made <i>Permalight, </i>the most active, physical, and fun album the Oakland band has ever released.</p>
<p>Rogue Wave have two solid albums to their name (<i>Out of the Shadow, Descended Like Vultures</i>), but both used distorted guitars for texture more than visceral force, and had no dance-related influence unless you count playing in waltz time. Unfortunately, and perhaps predictably, their new drive can be awkward. Even more unfortunately, it's most notable on what should be their catchiest songs. ""Good Morning (The Future)"" seems to think the future is IDM + fey indie songwriting à la the Postal Service. (Hey, it worked for Owl City.) Both ""Good Morning"" and the title track are hooky, but both come off like pep talks when they hope to seem like ecstatic roars. The chintzy vocal effects aim tobe inspired production touches; instead, they feel hastily tacked on, almost arbitrary.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Rogue Wave succeed in making their most aggressive album. That's all relative, granted, as hinted at by cautiously aggressive titles like ""We Will Make a Song Destroy"", ""Per Anger"", and ""Solitary Gun"". But due to curiously anemic and trebly production, the guitars comes across thin and brittle-- a band bringing knives to a gunfight. ""Per Anger"" fares best because its jangle doesn't stray far from Rogue Wave's area of expertise, and ""Solitary Gun"" has a sturdy melody. Elsewhere, ""Right With You"" and ""We Will Make a Song Destroy"" try the Pixies' whisper/scream dichotomy but end up somewhere between R.E.M.'s <i>Green </i>(if we're being generous) and Better Than Ezra's angsty <i>Friction, Baby </i>phase (if we're being realistic).</p>
<p>Rogue Wave are tough to root against, considering they've experienced a run of terrible luck that could have them drinking the Wrens under the table: their ""Lake Michigan"" used in ill-fated Zune commercials, a split from Sub Pop records despite an astonishing track record with TV music coordinators (four songs on ""The O.C."" alone!), Pat Spurgeon's debilitating kidney problems, and the departure and, later, shocking death of bassist Evan Farrell. You can't blame them for not dwelling on any of that, but now that Rogue's back in good health, here's hoping his band soon does the same.</p></div>"|13887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13887-permalight/|5.1|Ian Cohen

But what if they actually <i>did</i> know? That was the case for the noise/drone duo Yellow Swans, who made most of <i>Going Places </i>after deciding to disband in 2008. So if you hear a sense of finality, reflection, or even fate in this album, that impression has some basis in fact. It's even there in the title.</p>
<p>The thing is, Yellow Swans' music-- dense drones that build like narratives-- has always conveyed these kinds of concepts and feelings. What makes <i>Going Places </i>so great is how it transforms them from explainable ideas into things that can't be easily captured in words. When ""Opt Out"" rises from underwater tones into thick howls, you can feel anger and catharsis, but there's something else there, too. The long tones of ""Sovereign"" are clearly wistful, but that's just the tip of the track's layers. Maybe Pete Swanson and Gabriel Saloman's awareness of their pending demise added those extra levels, but it feels like <i>Going Places </i>would sound this good no matter what the time or circumstances.</p>
<p>The closest analogue to the album's effect might be cinema, where pictures and sound create an experience more like dreaming than just watching and listening. <i>Going Places </i>is music that plays like a movie. The duo relies more on field recordings and tape loops than before, and it gives a picturesque quality to their abstract sounds. Every moment is tactile and visual, like paint strokes that are just color on their own but together create a meaningful image. The resulting pictures are also wide and expansive, like a slow Stanley Kubrick pan or a meditative Terrence Malick nature shot. Think of it as noise in Imax.</p>
<p>Whether or not these cinematic pieces tell stories is probably up to the listener. But, as with the album title, Yellow Swans leave clues in the song names. On the hyper-busy ""Limited Space"", it sounds as if they're trying to let out every sound they can make before time runs out. ""New Life""'s beatific tones convey the optimism of rebirth, almost like noise-based therapy. And the title track feels distinctly like a takeoff, its whirring drones conjuring images of an airplane's wheels rolling, engines revving, and wings tilting toward the sky.</p>
<p>You might not hear those exact tales in these pieces, and that's one of the album's strengths. It gives you space to discover tons of themes and ideas without limiting you to specific ones. Still, this<i> </i>is no blank canvas, but more like a series of Rorschach tests where the shapes are in constant motion. The emphasis there is on constant-- this may be the last we'll hear of Yellow Swans, but <i>Going Places</i> doesn't sound like an end, or a beginning, or anything else tethered to the anchor of time.</p></div>"|13963.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13963-going-places/|8.3|Marc Masters

The same month, he released <i>Gonna Work Out Fine</i>, an aggressive set of music that crystallized a lot of what I'd been hearing in singles coming out of dubstep and what you could call the post-dubstep diaspora: an incorporation of house-music  rhythms, a more acidic sound palette, and some upbeat misanthropy in an otherwise superserious genre. Listening to his singles is like hearing dubstep getting a wedgie.</p>
<p>Untold is one of two producers featured on both <i>Sub:stance</i> and <i>Elevator Music</i>, two new compilations that serve as mini-anthropologies of dubstep in 2010-- who's making it and what it's sounding like. <i>Elevator Music</i> is a set of unmixed, exclusive tracks released on Fabric Recordings, a label linked to the London club of the same name (a former cold storage building; #2 on DJmag.com's Top 100 Clubs of 2009). <i>Sub:stance</i> is named for a dubstep-themed night at Berlin's Berghain (a former power station; #1), led by producer and Hotflush Recordings founder Paul Rose, aka Scuba.</p>
<p><i>Elevator Music</i> is brighter; <i>Sub:stance</i> is deeper and more atmospheric. What sounds better to you probably depends somewhat on temperament. If you don't think house music is chintzy shit for drunk clubbers, <i>EM</i> might be more appealing to you-- I certainly have more fun listening to it. If you like dubstep's mannered beauty and stiff upper lip, try <i>Sub:stance</i>. Even <i>EM</i>'s most downtempo track (Om Unit's ""Encoded"") has a sizzling, up-front feel that <i>Sub:stance</i>'s liveliest track (Joy Orbison's ""Hyph Mngo"") doesn't. There's certainly some overlap-- Martyn's ""Friedrichstrasse"" (from <i>EV</i>) could work on <i>Sub:stance</i>, and Ramadanman's ""Tempest"" (from <i>Sub:stance</i>) could work on <i>EV</i>: both tracks blur more lines than they draw.</p>
<p>I'll admit that I'm not sensitive to mixing when I'm listening to a disc like <i>Sub:stance</i>-- I hear it more as a set of songs than a demonstration of his DJ prowess. Still, that doesn't bring <i>Sub:stance</i> down at all-- it's a listenable and succinct lead-in to a lot of what's happening in dubstep, and I'd definitely recommend it to people who get freaked out and angry at the mere mention of dance-music subgenres. <i>Elevator Music</i> isn't perfect either-- it's a scattered record that does more to undercut a definition of dubstep than to help define it. But when I hear what guys like Untold are doing-- ""No-One Likes a Smart Arse"" for <i>Sub:stance</i> and the standout ""Bad Girls"" for <i>EM</i>-- I start to feel like that's part of the point: to set its weird little bastards running across the dancefloor, just to see what happens.</p></div>"|13971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13971-elevator-music-vol-1-substance/|7.5|Mike Powell

The troubled and trying DM album work apparently took so much out of Simenon that he spent several of the ensuing years recovering. In fact, Bomb the Bass went largely quiet after 1995's On-U Sound clash <i>Clear</i>, with no new album released until 2008's <i>Future Chaos</i>.</p>
<p>After a 13-year gap between previous Bomb the Bass records, the announcement of <i>Back to Light </i>was a slight surprise. The new record refines the Bomb the Bass relaunch with the addition of Gui Boratto as co-producer. On paper, this is just what Simenon needed. Bomb the Bass have rarely been about exploring the outer edges of dance music, and indeed the mundane <i>Future Chaos </i>boasted only the barest of nods to then-contemporary trends. Boratto, on the other hand, one of the stars of the Kompakt stable, is a savvy pick to bring Simenon up to date.</p>
<p>Boratto's addition seems to have inspired Simenon to loosen up. The blueprint of the record remains familiar to anyone who's heard Bomb the Bass, but the tempos have been slightly upped, the beats aren't quite all weighed down by a shared dour gravity, and the songs given an almost dreamy nuance. Yet the album still mostly mines the same analog gloom of <i>Future Chaos</i>, which in turn recalled Simenon's decade-old work with Depeche Mode. Indeed, DM's Martin Gore even pops up on the instrumental album closer ""Milakia"", adding keyboards to a track Simenon concedes had been sitting around unfinished for over ten years.</p>
<p>That the song fits right in really says it all about the Bomb the Bass disc as a whole-- solid and mostly serviceable. Simenon and Boratto keep the dynamics so even and consistent that very little jumps out. There are glimmers of Boratto's playful light-touch gifts simmering beneath the surface of songs such as ""Up the Mountain"" (featuring singer Sarah O'Shura of Portland's the Battle of Land and Sea), ""Blindspot"", or ""Burn Less Brighter"" (the latter two of which feature Gore-y BtB regular Paul Conboy, as do two other tracks), but they're largely subsumed by Simenon's moodiness.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with being down, and Simenon does it well. But what <i>Back to Light</i> boasts in studio acumen it lacks in personality. One even suspects Kelley Polar and Richard Davis were also tapped as guest vocalists because their sensibilities were already so in line with what Simenon wanted to achieve and not because they had anything particularly unique or original to offer. From a pioneer like Simenon, the decision to tread water is puzzling, since he remains capable of so much more. After all, not many producers have as strong a grasp of songs as they do sounds, and Simenon has always been one of those few. Hopefully his renewed activity continues apace, and next time his instincts and collaborators encourage him to risk the unfamiliar rather than settle for safety and comfort.</p></div>"|13981.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13981-back-to-light/|5.0|Joshua Klein

His bedraggled voice drips through the words. He's an addict, but it's as if he realizes none of it mattered, anyway-- there's no salvation, no redemption, only cold life and sudden death. One cop lives to kill another cop. (Or a junkie survives only long enough to shoot up again.) The world keeps turning. Just like in his opening line, he quotes John Prine: ""Jesus Christ died for nothing, I suppose.""</p>
<p>Since the 1997 release of <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>, Spiritualized have recorded three LPs, a handful of singles and EPs, and two double-disc sets called<i> Complete Works</i>. And the noise-gospel rock sprees that followed <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i> cemented Spiritualized's reputation as one of rock'n'roll's best live spectacles. Pierce has also scored a Harmony Korine film, recorded a solo electronics album, collaborated with Spring Heel Jack, and sculpted a mesmerizing long-form drone record with pianist Matthew Shipp. He also almost<i> </i>died, in 2005 of bilateral pneumonia, only to recover and finish a remarkable return to form-- <i>Songs in A&amp;E</i>. Yet Pierce unequivocally reached the height of his recorded powers with <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>. Bolder than the term Britpop might suggest, more focused than the term psychedelic might imply, <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i> is one of the great triumphs of the 70-plus-minute CD era. Alternately chaotic and meticulous, thundering and quivering, <i>Ladies and Gentlemen </i>finds power in conflict-- between restraint and excess, addiction and isolation, and ultimately, love and hate.</p>
<p>Like most any critical and commercial success, the record has now been repackaged with extra content-- specifically, in an ornate limited run meant for collectors and zealots. <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>'s treatment as an edition of 1,000 numbered box sets from ATP is outrageous and elegant enough to match its contents: Each song comes on an individual black three-inch CD, the discs sealed inside black blister packaging, like the single tablets of a treatment regimen. Two discs of demos and isolated elements from the finished tunes-- those lonesome, blue horns blaring through ""No God Only Religion"", for instance-- get their own package, too, as does a personalized prescription signed by the doctor Jason Pierce himself. The liner notes take the form of lengthy instructions and technical specs for the medicine-- how the pills were made, who made them, and how they should be taken. ""What is Spiritualized used for?"" asks the silver metallic ink. ""Spiritualized is used to treat the heart and soul.""</p>
<p>There's no better way to put it, really. <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i> is, at its core, an album about wanting something you don't have until, as ""Cop Shoot Cop..."" says, it brings you to your knees. Pierce wants to fill that hole in his arm, or-- as it were-- the hole in his heart. Kate Radley plays keyboards and sings on <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>, and she begins the album with that famous telephone call: ""Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in space,"" her voice delivering horrible news with ruinous calm. Her romance with Pierce had just ended. Four days before Spiritualized were to open for the Verve in England in 1995, she secretly married the headliner's Richard Ashcroft. ""All I want in life's a little bit of love to take the pain away,"" Pierce repeats for the album's first minute. Your heart would hurt, too.</p>
<p>Pierce famously denies that <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i> has anything to do with Radley, telling <i>The Guardian</i> as late as 2001 that ""People have this idea that anyone who writes music is bearing their soul."" He cited ""Broken Heart"", in which he admits that he's too busy to actually have one, as an example of <i>playfulness</i>. These songs were mostly written before they called it quits, he's said, and, after all, it's only rock'n'roll. But with very vivid words and visceral sounds, <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i> expresses the extremes of attachment and separation. ""I just don't know what to do on my own/ All of my thoughts are with you,"" Pierce sings. But he's not just hurt-- he's also angry. His band eventually unloads a rock salvo that feels like a fistfight. The drums roil. The piano pounds. If there ever was a melody, the harmonica's choked the breath from it. By the next number, he's practically sobbing over a galactic country drift: ""Stay with me/ Smile all the time/ Don't go."" He's still addicted to something, and on ""Electricity"", he lets us know how good it felt. ""I'm playing with fire, if you know what I mean.""</p>
<p>The rub, of course, is that we don't know what he means. We can only interpret and internalize for ourselves. Maybe it <i>was</i> Radley, or maybe it was the heroin he smoked and the booze he drank. Hell, maybe he was just being an entertainer. But if you don't know those feelings, the highs of love and the lows of loss, you've fared better than most. This sort of emotional ambiguity makes <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i> an eternal album, as provocative then as it is now. People haven't stopped loving and losing and hurting yet, and they won't, of course. These pleasures and pains can be attached to anything. But what makes this ostentatious reissue-- the box costs £125.00, or about $190, plus postage-- so interesting right now is that it feels like a souvenir forwarded from another era. <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i> is an extinct breed of album, a production so lavish that you have to think most record label executives would balk or faint at the thought of funding it in 2010. To wit, New Orleans fixture Dr. John is but a session player here, joining a cast of a dozen players, the London Community Gospel Choir, and a high-profile string quartet. (The record is also being reissued as a single disc, with new artwork, and as a 3xCD set without a lot of the pricy trappings of the more extravagant package.)</p>
<p>That spirit is evident on the demos included here as well. On <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>, ""Cool Waves"" is a diorama built with weepy vocals, darting flute, schmaltzy strings, building concert bass drums, and a choir that's just begging for salvation. But its one-minute demo included in this set seems no more complicated than the demos Pierce made with his schoolmates in 1984, his former band Spacemen 3's first recordings. If the demo is a Polaroid, the album is <i>Avatar</i>. There's no way it could have been cheap.</p>
<p>While <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i> established Spiritualized as one of the supreme bands of the 90s, it was by no means an overwhelming commercial success. It earned album of the year honors from NME in 1997 and placed on year-end charts in <i>The Village Voice</i>, <i>Q,</i> and <i>Uncut</i>. But <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i> charted only as high as No. 4 in England. In the United States, it's sold slightly more than 111,000 copies-- about 20,000 less than <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i>. To wit, Sony Music scrapped its plans for this reissue in America, meaning it's available only through ATP's mail-order service. The disc did better by the band's legacy, one assumes, than it did for any label's bottom line.</p>
<p>After all, it's an album mostly without a clear hit single, a massive production better enjoyed as a whole than in bits and pieces. Though Spiritualized eventually released edits, remixes, or reworkings of ""I Think I'm in Love"", ""Come Together"", and ""Electricity"", those songs thrive best in the context of the album-- in their original, much more grand iterations. ""I Think I'm in Love"", for instance, flows brilliantly from ""Come Together"" and, eight minutes later, its dénouement shapes the perfect non-introduction to the casual piano of ""All of My Thoughts"". In the interim, Pierce reveals the breadth of the band's ideas and influence. The first half combines Spacemen 3's LaMonte Young-like 20th century composition (with its growling synthesizer drone), dub, soul (with its thick, stunted bass line), American blues (with its twisted harmonica howls), and folk (Pierce's subtle autoharp strums). The back half is a sassy, baritone saxophone-backed dialogue between Pierce's self-confidence and his self-doubt: ""I think that I can rock'n'roll,"" he sings. ""Probably just twisting,"" he answers. And on ""Come Together"", one of only a few <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i> tunes you're likely to still hear live, Pierce fancies himself a young man that's sad and fucked (a word he manages to use five times in as many minutes here) amid references to suicide, heroin, and busted dreams.</p>
<p>Even ""Broken Heart"", the album's ballad and most beautiful moment, clocks in close to seven minutes. It needs every one of them, too, since the song's overwhelming sadness depends entirely on its length and its ability to establish an atmosphere. This is an album of emotion and empathy, and it's hard to capture feelings with a format. That's what ranks <i>Ladies and Gentlemen We are Floating in Space</i> alongside the best art: Jason Pierce and a big band that included his ex-girlfriend and a whole slew of people that soon became his ex-bandmates faithfully render the cycle of loving anything-- the innocent exuberance, the bitter rejection, the episodic denial-- in 70 perfect minutes. And even if you can't afford this version of that achievement, you should have it on hand. One day, it'll come in handy. After all, ""Spiritualized is used to treat the heart and soul.""</p></div>"|13984.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13984-ladies-and-gentlemen-we-are-floating-in-space-collectors-editon/|10.0|Grayson Currin

For every hauntingly poetic Sam Beam (Iron &amp; Wine) or piercingly larynx-blessed Jonathan Meiburg (Shearwater), there are a million and one singers a little too in love with their pens and pipes. Jason Collett isn't going to blow you away with his imagery, and his voice-- while sturdy and appealing-- doesn't stand out from the alt-troubadour pack. What Collett does know, however, is craftsmanship. While so many insurgent folkies treat sonics and structure as afterthoughts, Collett suffuses his music with a level of playfulness and variety that's reflective of his membership in the acclaimed indie-rock collective Broken Social Scene.</p>
<p>In a seeming demonstration of What Not to Do, Collett's fourth solo album, <i>Rat a Tat Tat</i>, is actually bookended by two songs that showcase the worst tendencies of indie-folk. On opener ""Rave on Sad Songs"" Collett lays on his maverick country pretensions syrupy-thick, affecting a John Prine/Terry Allen sneer to sing some ridiculously stylized stuff about tears falling in stereo and how ""happiness is for amateurs."" Closer ""Vanderpool Vanderpool"" is even worse, as Collett appears hellbent on cramming every noun Bob Dylan's ever uttered (hustlers, madames, levees, and Jerusalem all make an appearance, among many others) into a single track. Unsurprisingly, both songs feature accordion.</p>
<p>In between those self-indulgent missteps, however, Collett delivers a solid album that moves with confidence between breezy pop-rock and more pensive, artier endeavors. The reverbed, reggae-tinged ""Lake Superior"" and cheekily shuffling ""Love Is a Dirty Word"" posit Collett as Mellencamp 2.0, an earnest roots-rocker with a firm hold on rhythm. Meanwhile, ""Love Is a Chain"" yields a playful organ-and-handclaps-driven stomp as well as some genuinely engaging lyrics about a hot-and-cold relationship (""We fight and then we fuck and then we fight all over again/ It never ends"").</p>
<p>At the subtler end of the spectrum, Collett proves he can wring something ear-catching even out of quiet material, ornamenting ""Cold Blue Halo"" and ""Winnipeg Winds"" with delicate layers of studio effects and offering up ""Bitch City"" as the kind of hangdog burnout shamble that would fit perfectly midway through a BSS album. The modesty of Collett's ambitions is evident in the way he doesn't seem to mind being stuck beneath some of rock's more omnipresent influences (as the Beatlesque trifles ""High Summer"" and ""The Slowest Dance"" attest). Still, he deserves loads of credit, particularly considering his folk milieu, for almost always putting the song in front of the self.</p></div>"|13911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13911-rat-a-tat-tat/|7.0|Joshua Love

That was what people kept asking about Andrew W.K. around the time he emerged. Chant-along pop-metal anthems about partying mixed with earnest self-help talk about living every moment to the fullest? In 2001? Given that W.K. had some serious noise-rock/art-dude pedigree (drumming for To Live and Shave in L.A., for one), the whole thing seemed like it had to be some titanic art-school prank. But then came <i>I Get Wet</i>, the first album that carried the A.W.K. name, and <i>every song</i> sounded like introductory single ""Party Hard"". <i>I Get Wet</i> is a work of impeccable production and serious craftsmanship, every chorus and key-change in its exact right place. If it was part of a joke, it was dizzily well-rendered. After that, the few years of frenzied live shows dispelled any doubts. A.W.K. would straight-up tell security to let kids surge onstage, and it's not really possible to maintain ironic distance from the bottom of a pigpile of sweaty bellowing teenagers.</p>
<p>So Andrew W.K. isn't a joke, never was. If anything, he's like Stephen Colbert: A character played to such perfection, for so long, that the guy playing it couldn't help but merge it with his actual self on some level. <i>Close Calls With Brick Walls</i> is the moment the character started to break down, where W.K.'s noise-art tendencies finally came bubbling to the surface. On the 2006 LP, W.K. followed two straight platters of revved-up stomp-and-shout with something weirder, an album that mixed his old full-speed-all-the-time persona with blurts of Frank Zappa/Mike Patton squelch-and-growl, as well as a few totally incomprehensible sound experiments.</p>
<p>The slow, epic, triumphant opening track ""I Came for You"" was exactly the sort of thing that would've led perfectly into another roaring banger. Instead, track two is ""Close Calls With Bal Harbour"", a 1:20 dark ambient burble, with A.W.K. intoning sinister nothings over a throbbing synth. ""Dr. Dumont"" is a minute of placid, eerie piano and nothing else. The entire lyrical content of ""Golden Eyed Dog"" is as follows: ""The small golden eyed dog with the body shaped like a cat."" But amid all these WTF experiments, we can hear plenty of the old A.W.K. in the form of surging, unstoppable hookfests like ""One Brother"", the vaguely girl-group-esque ""Don't Call Me Andy"", and ""You Will Remember Tonight""-- the latter of which is one of the purest and best songs A.W.K. has ever written.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time in 2006 listening to <i>Close Calls</i> without coming any closer to understanding what the hell was going on with the record. Back then, the album only saw release in Japan and Korea, possibly because of a bitter legal dispute with a former manager, and interested parties like me ended up making do with downloads. (There was also a short-lived vinyl release on Providence noise label Load, thus making <i>Close Calls</i> probably the hookiest album in Load history.) Now, the album is finally getting an American release, packaged along with the unreleased-material collection <i>Mother of Mankind</i>, and it makes at least a tiny bit more sense. Throughout <i>Close Calls</i>, W.K.'s basic message never varies from what it was on his two major-label albums: Live every second as if you were about to keel over and die. ""Not Going to Bed"" is literally about not going to bed: ""Are you gonna go to sleep on the table? <i>I'm not!</i> Are you gonna fall asleep watching cable? <i>I'm not!</i>"" The rest of the album, despite its stylistic left turns, basically follows suit: Big anthems about being yourself and having fun.</p>
<p><i>The Wolf</i>, W.K.'s second album, had repeated all the same tricks as <i>I Get Wet</i>, to slightly diminished results. So maybe <i>Close Calls</i> was an attempt to musically expand in as many directions as possible, Philip Glass minimalism and Motörhead biker-boogie as well as the Zappa stuff. It's not entirely successful, partly because W.K. didn't have the same gigantic, expensive production at his disposal. (The totally disposable <i>Mother of Mankind</i> seems to back this up. Comprised almost entirely of budget-ass attempted party anthems, it's not the kind of thing anyone needs to hear more than twice.) But the great moments on <i>Close Calls</i>, ""You Will Remember Tonight"" in particular, remain undiminished four years later. And when you've got four or five ridiculously great songs on one album, the ill-advised noise experiment bits suddenly become a whole lot more tolerable.</p></div>"|13957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13957-close-calls-with-brick-wall-mother-of-mankind/|6.8|Tom Breihan

Aesthetic differences aside, songs like ""Dart for My Sweetheart"" and ""Cherry Lips"" were almost Spoon-like in their economy. And while ABO singer/guitarist Sam Windett's voice isn't conventionally pretty, he conveyed a rare emotional intensity, even danger. <i>Derdang</i>'s timing, however, was unfortunate. Ahead of any garage rock revival, the 2006 LP dovetailed with the rise and UK chart triumph of Arctic Monkeys.</p>
<p>No surprise then that, four years later, the bearded trio's copping a different sound-- one that includes synthesizers, dance beats, and Tim Goldsworthy's production work. Lame bandwagon-jumping? Actually, no. Former DFA-co-honcho Goldsworthy didn't stamp his dance-punk signature on every one of <i>Coconut</i>’s tracks, but the ones he did are uniformly ace. On first single ""Shark's Teeth"", ABO's buzzsawing guitars and punk instincts are preserved, but leavened with Hercules &amp; Love Affair-style disco nostalgia. ""Hoola""'s another peak, its cooing female backups flirting with Windett's strangulated yelp in a swirl of beats and hooks. Two psychedelic rave-ups on the record's first half, ""Magnetic Warrior"" and ""Wild Strawberries"", offer both delirious drone and expert popcraft.</p>
<p>But <i>Coconut</i> stumbles midway through with ""You Have a Right to a Mountain Life/One Up on Yourself"". A title like that's a tip-off, and the song is indeed a malodorous heap of bellowing reverb, guitar noodling, and dire lyrics like ""Eat your heart out/ It's yours to eat."" ""Mountain"" is only four minutes long, but feels like 40. However, it may be preferable to the several cuts that follow. With little of their predecessors' electro-pop sparkle or psychedelic fireworks, but plodding rhythms and vanilla-flavored melodies to spare, tracks like ""Bite It &amp; Believe It"" and ""Hunt You Down"" kill any momentum the album had generated.</p>
<p>In fact, the whole second half of <i>Coconut</i> would be a wash if it weren't for finale ""Run Gospel Singer"", in which Windett assumes a favorite role as maiden-tempting-Mephistopheles. ""You're a gospel singer and I am a seller of songs"" he wheezes over swishy tambourines and Arp Cleveland's headlonged kick drums. The track's rough and rushed, but also sexy and spontaneous, leaving you wishing the album offered more like it. So, yes, <i>Coconut</i> seems to be a ""transition album"": A sometimes-exhilarating, sometimes-WTF layover between a possibly played-out formula and exciting new sounds on the horizon.</p></div>"|13985.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13985-coconut/|6.4|Amy Granzin

Most of those records were self-released-- cut by Fred from the same lathe the Kingsmen's ""Louie, Louie"" was once famously carved. But in 2006, Dead Moon finally broke up after nearly two decades of grinding. The Coles were nearing 60; Fred was wearing hearing aids; Drummer Andrew Loomis felt it was time to stop. Naturally, they hung out for a few months before forming a new band: Pierced Arrows, with new drummer Kelly Halliburton, the son of a former bandmate of Fred's. As Toody Cole told <i>Seattle Weekly</i> in August 2007: ""Mom and Dad aren't ready to mellow out just yet.</p>
<p>And they haven't. Not much, anyway. While <i>Descending Shadows </i>(their second full-length and first for Vice) is leaner and mellower than anything they've done, it still barrels forth with the same haggard, long-fanged intent that made Dead Moon so great. Here they mix in more country and blues licks, though where Pierced Arrows' garage rock truly deviates is in Fred and Toody's increased attention to melody. While fronting Dead Moon, Fred spent a lot of time filling his lyric sheets with nightmarish images of graveyards, impending doom, and (get this) moons. Pop elements were never far away, but riffs burrowed straight to your gut. Opener ""This Is the Day"" and the claustrophobic ""Buried Alive"" stick to that formula, as the ramble of ""Tripped Out"" and ""This Time Around"" sound stately. And in ""Ain't Life Strange"", we feel a fresh force. Over a flickering guitar, the Coles combine on vocal duties, sounding perfectly in-step and totally in love. It's a slow jam and there are few traces of fuzz pedal, but it still has the mark of songwriting that can knock you down if you're not ready for it.</p>
<p>Not long thereafter they up the volume again for ""Paranoia"", six mangy minutes of guitar noise slung around one simple, sly bass figure. Within its first 60 seconds, the cracks in Fred's voice are more on display than usual. While the two of them have never sounded polished behind a microphone, he sounds especially out of breath. But it's fitting: The Coles' music has always been direct and gloriously raw; they were, after all, pressing lo-fi long before the current wave of fuzz-loving bands. Which is a slightly defensive way of saying that this music has never gone down smooth on tape. Be it in the growl of ""On Our Way"" or the belted/traded choruses of closer ""Coming Down to Earth"", the rough edges can't obfuscate how passionately every note's delivered. That can't be an easy thing to capture off-stage. Somehow the Coles did.</p></div>"|13988.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13988-descending-shadows/|6.6|David Bevan

Sadly, this will probably wind up being the epitaph for <i>Tomorrow, in a Year</i>. No matter which angle you approach it from, the Knife's latest project-- a 90-plus-minute longform work about the life of Charles Darwin-- can seem bewildering.  However self-consciously arty and macabre the Knife have been in the past, they've always seemed like a pop group at heart. Here nothing even remotely approaching a steady beat shows up for more than half its length. Whether Knife fans will hang on through the album's formless, screeching opening, or whether opera aficionados will simply regard this as the dabbling of pop-music dilettantes, is hard to say. What does seem certain is, like many difficult, unclassifiable albums before it, <i>Tomorrow, in a Year </i>is fated to be discussed more than actually heard.</p>
<p>Part of <i>Tomorrow, In a Year's </i>dilemma is that it comes contextualized as an opera. For most listeners, opera has vague, mostly derogatory connotations: old, imposing, foreign, dead, faintly ridiculous. And once you invoke opera, the Knife aren't just trying to match their fans' expectations after <i>Silent Shout</i>; they're implicitly demanding to be measured by the same yardstick used to size up, say, Wagner's <i>Ring Cycle</i>.  While the designation is, in some senses, accurate-- <i>Tomorrow</i> has a libretto and an operatic mezzo-soprano, and the whole thing was performed in September 2009 by the Danish performance group Hotel Pro Forma, which commissioned it-- the tag is probably more off-putting than useful for listeners already struggling to locate entry points into this forbidding, oftentimes-alienating work.</p>
<p>Things don't get off to a flying start: <i>Tomorrow, in a Year</i>'s first 10 minutes are a painstaking buildup of environmental noises-- a primordial soup of sound appropriate to a work about the origin of life. That's one way of putting it; another might be that it opens with the sounds of a drippy sink and a chain link fence buckling in heavy winds, followed by five minutes of patience-trying buzzing. Where you come down on this spectrum will probably depend on your level of investment, and, more crucially, your listening environment. Taking in the album in different settings gave me a little of both reactions. (At home, in front of massive speakers, following along with the lyrics: absorbing. On an iPod during a morning commute: maddening.) This is deeply un-portable music: It either demands your complete attention or invites you to shut it off.</p>
<p>Once through that opening stretch, your attention will frequently be rewarded. There is powerfully evocative, richly imagined music to be found here. Olof Dreijer and Karin Dreijer-Andersson's commitment to the Darwinian conceptual framework is complete, sometimes pushing the borders of sanity: Olof Dreijer spent time in the Amazon recording and observing different species while writing, and in ""Letter to Henslow"", one of the album's most supremely batshit moments, Dreijer and his sister whoop and ululate alongside actual field recordings of Amazonian birds. Dreijer's field research also turns up in his synth tones through the album, like the chittering, insectoid buzzing at the edges of ""Variation of Birds"".</p>
<p>Karin and Olof find all kinds of neat little ways to echo the unfolding drama as Darwin's observations move from geology and biology toward a unifying theory of all life. In ""Geology"" and ""Minerals"", mezzo-soprano Kristina Wahlin Momme delivers her lines in bursts of hurried singspiel as massive sheets of industrial noise grind and shudder beneath her, suggesting the shifting of the Earth's core. The disarmingly gorgeous ""Ebb Tide Explorer"" is a fragile collection of wisps and swells, Swedish singer/songwriter Jonathan Johansson singing in lilting two-note phrases that mimick the lazily swaying action of the seaweed he is describing.</p>
<p>As the story moves from Darwin's theories of all life into the details of his personal life, the relentless ominousness of the music finally lifts, and the album enters its most inviting stretch.  ""Annie's Box"" is a spare, plangent ode to Darwin's daughter Annie, who died when she was only 10 years old. With its yawning open spaces, haunted by a single, mournful viola drone, it recalls the icy beauty of Nico's <i>Marble Index</i>. That's mere prologue for the one-two climax: ""The Colouring of Pigeons"" and ""Seeds"", 20 minutes of tingly alchemy that feel like the lightning-flash realization that the entire work has been struggling toward.</p>
<p>Anchored by a groaning cello and a rolling tribal beat, ""The Colouring of Pigeons"" unfolds in graceful layers, all in service to an aching, upward-arcing melody shared by Olof, Karin, and Momme. ""Seeds"" surges forward on a light four-on-the-floor pulse, surrounded a prismatic light show of bell sounds and a rubbery synth not far from current dubstep. At long last, it's a floor filler of sorts-- albeit one with harmonized mezzo-soprano overdubs and lyrics like, ""Transoceanic pods and capsules/ Will old occupants allow for room and sustenance?""</p>
<p>The uninterrupted stretch of ""Pigeons"" into ""Seeds"" is the only moment on <i>Tomorrow, in a Year</i> where this is recognizably the work of the Knife, and not coincidentally it's the most thrilling and vital music on the record. Reconciling their boundless ambitions with their crowd-pleasing instincts, they hit upon a sweet spot that only Laurie Anderson and few others have managed to locate-- a clearing where pop and the avant-garde meet and make each other freshly strange and inviting. Who knows what kind of reception this will receive; if it's any kind of prologue to an epiphany that allows whole albums of music as inspired as ""Pigeons"" and ""Seeds"", however, maybe we'll look back at it in five years as the moment the Knife first went next level.</p></div>"|13974.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13974-tomorrow-in-a-year/|6.9|Jayson Greene

That second type tend to be stopgaps and rewards for committed fans, and as such they tend to be the more forgettable of the two. (Though Grizzly Bear's <i>Friend</i> was a recent notable success.)</p>
<p>Still, we can forgive a band like A Sunny Day in Glasgow for offering up something of a patchwork EP with <i>Nitetime Rainbows</i>. After all, this is a group that managed to cram no fewer than 22 tracks onto last year's winning hour-plus opus, <i>Ashes Grammar</i>, so it stands to reason that there would be plenty more from where that came from. What's more, the Philly outfit seems to be experiencing something of a recent renaissance. After playing lineup musical chairs for a few years, a band has finally coalesced around ASDIG mastermind Ben Daniels, and it makes sense that the new crew is eager to get more representative material out there. Hence the <i>Nitetime Rainbows</i> EP, home to three new compositions, alongside the title track (lifted from <i>Ashes</i> but newly mixed) and three remixes of said tune. As if the times needed another sign, it's vinyl and digital only.</p>
<p><i>Ashes Grammar</i> was the rare record that actually benefitted from its sprawl, and the act of teasing ecstatic moments out of that sprawl is a key delight of the <i>Ashes</i> listening experience. <i>Nitetime</i> foregrounds one of the finer moments, a series of particularly evocative synthetic tones that form the intro of ""Nitetime Rainbows"". Hidden amidst the LP, these sounds have a transformative, palette-cleansing effect, but even divorced from that context they still make for a marvelously effective mood-setter. Otherworldly and nocturnal, that mood is less second-hand signifiers and more of a piece with the stuff that makes dream-pop and shoegaze so alluring in the first place.</p>
<p>As if to suggest there's more than one way to assemble the <i>Ashes Grammar</i> puzzle, ASDIG roll ""Nitetime"" right into ""Daytime Rainbows"", and a renewed <i>esprit de corps</i> immediately becomes evident. The syrup-thick toms and initial volley of ""do-do-do""s would have us think we're due for a jangle-pop throwback rave-up in the style of Vivian Girls or the Pains of Being Pure of Heart, but before long a guitar goes de-tuned, the vocals get smeared, and we're right back to business as usual. Even so, to date it's their most pure pop moment. ""So Bloody, So Tight"" is pretty clean and patient by ASDIG standards, while ""Piano Lessons"" turns Daniels' late-night attempt to relearn the titular instrument into a spirited ride along a motorik groove. It would have made a perfect closing track were it not for...</p>
<p>The remixes, which is where, in true clearinghouse fashion, things start to taper off and feel tacked-on. Athens, Georgia's the Buddy System come up trumps here with their take on ""Rainbows"", which shimmers things up and chops the vocals into a delirious rhythmic component. It's rote but enjoyable all the same. Kranky recording artist Benoît Pioulard sands the smooth edges of ""Nitetime"" with glaciers of static, very much in the manner of Fennesz or Tim Hecker.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, there's Anticipate label boss Ezekiel Honig, whose significantly more subtle reworking deconstructs the original track into a few chief elements: a drone here, a guitar loop there, a lone handclap somewhere in between. If anything, though, it serves only to prove that it's the <i>collusion</i> of these elements that makes the original such a golden egg. <i>Ashes Grammar</i>, mind you, wasn't without its dull moments-- they were just tucked away at appropriate intervals across a majestic sonic vista. Here those moments cloud together, and the view gets a little obscured.</p></div>"|13962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13962-nitetime-rainbows-ep/|7.0|Matthew Solarski

Matt Pike growls out his badass nonsense lyrics like a more gnarled Lemmy, if that's even possible, and rips out one gut-busting riff and shattering solo after another. His rhythm section does their best to imitate an elephant stampede. Their basic format might vary a bit over the course of an album; they're not averse to floridly acoustic intros or eastern-tinged psych moments. But their fundamental mission won't ever change. They make tough, fast, snarly stoner metal. It's just what they do.</p>
<p><i>Snakes for the Divine</i> is the band's fifth album. For this one, they've decamped from the venerable metal indie Relapse to the way-less-venerable indie E1. On their previous two efforts, the band worked with legendary scuzz-rock producers (Steve Albini on 2005's <i>Blessed Black Wings</i>, Jack Endino on 2007's <i>Death Is This Communion</i>). On this one, they switch things up a bit, working with Greg Fidelman, who produced Slayer's 2009 comeback album, <i>World Painted Blood</i>, and worked on a whole mess of recent Rick Rubin projects. Fidelman's not as natural a fit for High on Fire as Albini or Endino, and the very, <i>very</i> slight sheen he brings to the proceedings doesn't do them any favors. The drums don't wallop <i>quite</i> as hard, and Pike's guitar doesn't sound <i>quite</i> as much like the sound of a swamp demon bellowing. But Fidelman's smart enough to keep his tweaks from interfering much, and the band's apocalyptic fury sounds undiminished even after the last masterful two albums.</p>
<p>And High on Fire aren't in any danger of losing their punch. They've gone through a few bassists now, but over the years they've developed the sort of telepathic alchemy that defines a great power trio. When one of their eight-minute tracks pauses for a split second, your heart leaps because you just know they're about to rip into yet another totally flattening new riff. Their songs don't really bother much with earthly concerns. ""Ghost Neck"", which I  <i>think</i> is about some sort of junkie, contains the following unparseable line: ""Overdosing on the mutual garbage/ Skeleton in the end unfolds"". If I had to guess, I'd say the awesomely named ""Frost Hammer"" was about some sort of invasion of winter gods, but the song's highlight comes when Pike just screams the title four times. High on Fire are the sort of band who put devils or skulls or snake-demon ladies on their album covers just because those things are awesome, not because they illustrate any larger cultural point. And five albums in, they're very, very good at generating awesome on demand.</p>
<p>A couple of songs here, ""Bastard Samurai"" and ""How Dark We Pray"", do awesome better than the rest by slowing down the band's galloping tempo and letting their riffs breathe. Pike already did slow to perfection in his previous band, doom-metal legends Sleep, and these two songs don't sound much like Sleep. They pull all the same tricks as the fastest HOF ragers; they just pull them slower. ""Bastard Samurai"" locks into a brontosaurus stomp, letting Pike actually sing on the verses, building up to a climactic roar instead of just hitting with that roar straight in. (And when he does finally roar, the lyric is this: ""Son of a bitch will <i>bleed a whiiiiiiile</i>!"" It's <i>so badass</i>.) On ""How Dark We Pray"", bassist Jeff Matz gets enough room to add some melodic flourishes instead of just crunch, and the song builds up a serious head of steam over its eight minutes.</p>
<p>But even though those two tracks may be highlights, the album really has no weak moments. Like the other HOF full-lengths before it, <i>Snakes for the Divine</i> shows that metal, in its most basic and elemental forms, still has plenty of visceral thrill left in it-- as long as it's done right. And High on Fire do it right.</p></div>"|13966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13966-snakes-for-the-divine/|8.0|Tom Breihan

That's less a joke at the expense of Wu odds-and-sods collections than a legit point of clarification: This is literally a sequel of sorts to the deceptively similar <i>Mathematics Presents: Wu-Tang and Friends Unreleased</i> collection from 2007.</p>
<p>But even if there is a tacit acknowledge that the Wu market is defined by insatiable demand, such collections should come equipped with a purpose-- either as a primer for novices (like 2008's <i>Wu: The Story of the Wu-Tang Clan</i>), or full of obscurities for Wu fans. We'd say <i>Return of Wu and Friends </i>fails spectacularly on both counts, but it's a shame to waste the term ""spectacular"" on such a mundanely depressing, blatant cash-in. (Though, let's get real, this probably won't make a dime for anyone.)</p>
<p>If you're in a forgiving mood, perhaps you can enjoy <i>Return </i>as a kind of song-spotting game, since most of this <i>is </i>recycled material from the numbingly forgettable post-<i>The W</i>, pre-<i>8 Diagrams </i>Wu dead zone. At the time, only Wu members with some variation of the word ""Killer"" in their name made music worth a shit. Yet this doesn't even pull tracks from the <i>good</i> Masta Killa album-- ""It's What It Is"" and ""Iron God Chamber"" might've been the strongest cuts from <i>Made in Brooklyn </i>and have the liveliest and cleanest production within context, but it's hardly the sound of anyone pushing themselves.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it's mostly Mathematics getting high on his own supply: ""Rush"", ""John 3:16"" (a preview of Method Man's sorta-revival on<i> 4:21... The Day After</i>), and Inspectah Deck showcase ""Real Nillas"" can be found on 2005's <i>The Problem</i>. Some tracks are on even greater <i>Multiplicity </i>shit: ""Strawberries and Cream"" also showed up on <i>The Problem</i>, but Ghostface's verse is taken verbatim from <i>Bulletproof Wallets'</i> ""Strawberry""-- though trading Trife Da God for Deck and RZA is an upgrade.</p>
<p>You're promised ""exclusive"" new tracks, yet in order for there to be ""Clap 2010"", an original ""Clap"" had to exist. And you know it does, if you happened to let <i>The W </i>run after ""Jah World"" ended. Only back then, it didn't sound like it was playing inside a duffle bag, and it kept the kung-fu fighting effects to a minimum. ""Steppin' 2 Me"" is actually GZA's ""Breaker Breaker"" remix given a boom-bap beat dull even by latter-day GZA album standards and ""Early Grave"" picks off an ODB verse from <i>4:21's </i>""Dirty Mef""-- give yourself a hand if you managed to spot the raw material and decide for yourself if it's something you're either proud or ashamed of.</p>
<p>Goddamn, even the title is false advertising, considering the display of vitality from <i>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II </i>just months prior. They didn't return to do anything here other than overlook the application of dubbed-cassette production values and haphazard sequencing to what were B-level Wu-Tang raps in the first place. Used to be that everything you were trying to forget about the Clan during the mid-2000s-- the disinterested rhyming, the anonymous and outsourced beatmaking, the complete lack of inspiration or organization-- was a little something called <i>Iron Flag.</i> Consider this a suitable replacement.  <i> </i></p></div>"|13967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13967-mathematics-presents-return-of-wu-and-friends/|3.2|Ian Cohen

Specifically, the popular ideal of mix-making, i.e., the kind you make to express yourself to another person. As such, their songs tend to be kinda cutesy and obsessed with love and relationships. The world is one in which people are constantly falling in and out of love, and even when their lyrics stray into cynicism and self-deprecation, it's obvious they are true believers in old-school romance. Most of their songs come across like a young person putting up a jaded front to defend their wounded, open heart. It's very sweet stuff, but usually just shy of cloying. Their technique is mature and refined, yet loose and free-wheeling. More than anything, they're wholesome. That could be a damning term for some listeners, but if you're the type of person who does not reflexively recoil at reading the word ""cuddle,"" you're probably going to find something to like in their music.</p>
<p>Rebecca Taylor and Charles Watson co-write their songs, and in most cases, sing the songs together. Their voices complement each other nicely but are distinct in tone and personality. Most often, Taylor and Watson sing in unison, and generally avoid making it seem as though they are singing to one another. Whereas many male-female vocal pairings have a communicative quality and/or an apparent subtext of sexual tension, Slow Club have a more neutral dynamic. It's not sexless, but there's seldom an implication that Watson and Taylor are pining for each other. The major exception is the nearly-saccharine opening track ""When I Go"", which has them making a series of pacts to get married if they're both still alone at various ages. Perhaps putting that song at the top of the running order is in some way meant to have us question their relationship in the subsequent songs.</p>
<p>Though Watson has a pleasant tenor voice, Taylor is generally a better singer, and the songs come alive when her more expressive voice is highlighted in the arrangement, as when she takes the lead on the chorus of ""Giving Up on Love"" or the during climax of the jangly travelogue ""Trophy Room"". She gets a few spotlight songs, and the best of them is in an unlisted song on the same track as the finale ""Our Most Brilliant Friends"". It's the simplest, saddest song on the album, gently building up to their most heartbreaking lyric: ""You say 'baby' a lot in your songs/ It takes all my courage not to sing along."" It's a fragile moment, but it's not oversold or delivered with an ironic grin. It's almost unbearably earnest, actually, but sometimes that is precisely what you need. Slow Club nail these precious, vulnerable feelings without getting mawkish or melodramatic. Everything, from their cheery optimism to their crestfallen lovesickness is life-sized and lived-in, resulting in a crop of tiny, good-natured tunes that invite the intense identification of young romantics.</p></div>"|13975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13975-yeah-so/|7.4|Matthew Perpetua

But Stewart's strong personality made it feel like a solo project-- at least until Caralee McElroy came along. It's not immediately obvious why she would become so strongly associated with Xiu Xiu by fans, in a way prior collaborators weren't. She joined after Stewart's flagship album, <i>Fabulous Muscles</i>, and she didn't divert much attention from his dark charisma. Instead, she pierced through in small ways: scatters of gamelan, synthesized ruffles, cuddly lead vocals on ""Hello from Eau Claire"". She seemed a calming presence in Stewart's turbulent world. But mostly, it just seemed right that there should be two, a boy and a girl, a xiu and a xiu. One person alone in the woods is a scary story. Two is a fairy tale.</p>
<p>Alas, McElroy has left the Xiu Xiu fold and joined Cold Cave. <i>Dear God, I Hate Myself </i>features collaborators both new-- Angela Seo on pianos, synths, and drum programming-- and old, like Saunier, Deerhoof's John Dieterich, and out-music drummer Ches Smith. It leans heavily on some ""crossover album"" signifiers: There's lots of steamy synth-pop and gothic chiptune; a traditional folk cover (""Cumberland Gap"") and a guest choir on ""This Too Shall Pass Away (For Freddy)"". But Xiu Xiu's music has always featured constant cosmetic modification, and fans will find themselves on familiar turf. New listeners will be immediately confronted with a couple of very catchy, horror-laced new wave anthems about fatal beatings and bulimia, and make that perennial first-Xiu-Xiu-experience decision: Do I buy this?</p>
<p>""If you expect me to be outrageous/ I will be extra outrageous,"" Stewart sings on ""Gray Death"", but that's a tall order for a guy who began his career with albums called <i>Knife Play</i> and <i>Fag Patrol. </i>If his obsessions with negative self-image, violence, and mental disorder have lost some of their shock value, that's okay: ""Gray Death"" doesn't need it to be an excellent song. It has an instantly appealing vocal melody and an urgent arrangement for acoustic guitar and synthesizer, not to mention one of those touching moments Stewart uses to temper his brutality: ""You were beautiful and I loved you/ My little bank robbing boy/ You were beautiful and I lost you/ Like a whip covered in pins and glue."" Now that the novelty of his volatile temperament has worn off, we can hear his sharp songwriting and fascinating sound design more clearly.</p>
<p>The album has strong elements of pastiche. ""Hyunhye's Theme"", one of those creaky ballads Stewart does so affectingly, stands apart from all the sweaty art-pop, as do the bleary strings of ""Impossible Feeling"". This sense of ordered disturbance plays out in individual songs, too. There's a snippet of blocky rock guitar airdropped into the soft contours of ""Gray Death"", and the title track is a chest-beater that repeatedly breaks down into everything from IDM blips to hip-hop scratches. Over a rubbery pulse, ""Chocolate Makes You Happy"" seems to transform bar by bar-- flurries of computer noise, broken bells, touch-tone synths and more weave in and out of the aching vocal line. These are songs with their hair sticking up. This cultivated chaos produces complex music filled with insinuating hooks.</p>
<p>The chiptune elements tend to be the weakest links. Stewart made four tracks primarily on music software for the Nintendo DS, which can obviously get a little chintzy-sounding. It works fine on the title track, where the bouncy glitches have powerful vocal and guitar parts to play against. But ""Apple for a Brain"", with its weaker vocal melody and more pronounced video game sounds, feels listless and bare. Xiu Xiu should never even remotely remind you of Atom and His Package. Luckily, most of the album avoids easy preciousness and focuses on Xiu Xiu's more troubled, troublesome variety. It's remarkable how much mileage he's wrung out of basically melding New Order with the <i>Suspiria </i>soundtrack. Every time he's about to come out with a new album, I think, ""I must be over this by now."" I never am. Even without McElroy at his side, he's still got plenty of excoriating to do, and a surplus of pressurized self to vent.</p></div>"|13933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13933-dear-god-i-hate-myself/|7.3|Brian Howe

Since she dropped her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11419-boogybytes-vol-04/"">Boogybytes mix</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11525-sool/""><i>Sool</i></a> in 2008, however, she's acted more as a scene curator than an artist, counting just a remix and a single as official releases and instead focusing her energy on BPitch Control's expanding roster and her own <a href=""http://fashion.ellenallien.de/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fashion label</a>. <i>Watergate 05</i>, a mix for Berlin's famed Watergate club (where Allien holds a DJ residency), not only marks Allien's first full-length release since 2008, it is her latest contribution to a high-profile mix series, following both BPitch's own Boogybytes and her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10613-fabric-34/"">2007 mix</a> for London's Fabric club.</p>
<p><i>Watergate 05</i> is the second mix Allien has provided from Watergate-- her 2009 podcast for <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast-episode.aspx?id=152"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Resident Advisor</a> was recorded live at the club. Working there seems to have loosened up Allien a bit, as both <i>Watergate</i> and her RA mix are friendlier and jammier than previous deck work. Where <i>Boogybytes</i> felt tightly wound, <i>Watergate</i> is almost schizophrenic, featuring work from looser producers like Matias Aguayo, Luciano, and Röyksopp.</p>
<p>Here Allien allows her selections to develop-- <i>Watergate</i> offers just 16 tracks during its hour runtime. This leads to few mixing revelations, placing the focus squarely on Allien's choices. After a ho-hum opening featuring some meticulous but boilerplate techno from John Tejada and DJ Yellow, Niconé &amp; Sascha Breamer's ""Nur Ma Kurz (Philip Bader Remix)"" sets the tone: humid, busy percussion set against earworm vocal samples. It's something Allien returns to with Aguayo's vocal mix of ""Bo Jack"", Allien's own remix of Uffie's ""Pop the Glock"", and AGF/Delay's outstanding Connection (""Heartthrob Remix)"". Finishing the set with Brigitte Fontaine &amp; Khan's ""Fine Mouche (Original Tango Paris Version)"", a wry French piano ballad, is a welcome concession, as it's probably not the type of track you can close a proper live set with.</p>
<p><i>Watergate</i>'s main fault is that it's too backloaded: The Uffie and AGF/Delay tracks both appear in the final minutes, as does nsi.'s disquieting remix of Margarat Dygas' ""Hidden Form View"". The mix hinges on longtime Allien pal Apparat's remix of Röyksopp's ""This Must Be It"", which features the Knife's Karin Dreijer Andersson. The remix takes the original's glassy Euro-pop and replaces it with a roiling electro loop, massive enough that it overshadows the mix's excellent back-end.</p>
<p>At this point it seems unlikely that Allien is going to submit a truly defining mix; she seems content to use these high-profile gigs to tweak her formula while continuing to build the Berlin scene (as always, several of Allien's friends and collaborators feature here). <i>Watergate 05</i> can frustrate, but ultimately Allien's ability to differentiate her mixes while retaining her voice makes <i>Watergate</i> a worthwhile addition to her catalog.</p></div>"|13949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13949-watergate-05/|6.9|Andrew Gaerig

On each of the Danish band's first two albums, they've had flashes of melodrama, majesty, and melody capable of approaching indie's top tier-- the Arcade Fire's masterfully built crescendos, M83's epic electronic accessibility, Sufjan Stevens' pretty, piled-high themes.</p>
<p>Efterklang splice those little shots of splendor through <i>Magic Chairs</i>, their third LP and first for 4AD, too. Surveying just the first three tracks, certain spells are breathtaking. On album highlight and opener ""The Modern Drift"", loose, rattling drums puncture a canvas of pointillist piano and stretched strings. On ""Alike"", distant female vocals and a squiggling trumpet chase Casper Clausen through the third verse, demanding a sing-along. And on ""I Was Playing Drums"", a bass tone becomes both the bully and the bedrock, creating perfect suspense as it pushes through flitting violins and stuttering drums with one note and pulls them back into place with the next.</p>
<p>But the generous surroundings those moments enjoyed on Efterklang's previous LPs are largely absent on <i>Magic Chairs.</i> On the new album, aggressive editing aims more for pop clarity than musical intrigue. Despite the contributions of auxiliary members Heather and Peter Broderick, everything seems standard and safe. ""Harmonics"" feels like a tepid adult-contemporary take on Dirty Projectors, and ""Raincoats"" is a straight shot for the heart of college radio. The album's unabashed attempt at a hit, ""Scandinavian Love"", seems as if it hopes to pull U2 out of the stadium and into the theatre. ""Human lips, stop loving like a boy,"" sings Clausen, dragging the limpid line over an array of violins and background vocals. It's the sort of ham-fisted pop that Efterklang used to combat. Only ""The Modern Drift"", which suggests <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i> repurposed into hero-rock, delights with uncertainty.</p>
<p>Slaraffenland, the excellent troupe of Danes that's often toured and collaborated with Efterklang, made a similar move on last year's <i>We're on Your Side</i>. Their previous record, <i>Private Cinema</i>, subdivided hooks with textural escapades that were innovative if not always well incorporated. <i>We're on Your Side</i>, though, seemed too aware of that criticism, focusing more on tightening the songs than teasing out the liberties that might have been taken with them. <i>Magic Chairs</i> just feels circumscribed, then, like the work of a band hoping to put the full weight of its big ensemble behind anthems bound for international audiences.</p>
<p>Most frustratingly, the songwriting is still here: Even if ""The Soft Beating"" rises to a romantic high in the most predictable fashion, you won't soon forget the choral proclamations in the coda. And though the path ""Mirror, Mirror"" takes to its climax is familiar and safe, its weepy confessions are no less memorable. So the songs are here now, but the accompaniment was there then. Let's hope <i>Magic Chairs</i> is as much terminal as it is transitional, meaning that next time, they'll get all of that grandness right.</p></div>"|13972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13972-magic-chairs/|5.9|Grayson Currin

Beyond being an easy way for these Vancouver Anglophones to score some Francophone cool, it serves to contemporize an album that both deliberately evokes-- both in sound and collaborative process-- early-60s Brill Building pop-song production, and one whose recording first commenced some five years ago.</p>
<p>On top of enumerating the album's formidable 39-person guest list, Gigi principals Nick Krgovich (of art-popsters No Kids) and Colin Stewart (producer for Black Mountain, among others) are careful to itemize each track's recording date in the liner notes-- perhaps to show their efforts coincided with, or even predated, those of soft-pop peers the Pipettes, Lucky Soul, and Camera Obscura. But then <i>Maintenant</i> feels more an extension of a certain Vancouver-bred pop classicism-- one that dates back to Carl Newman's pre-New Pornographers outfit Zumpano on through to the unheralded ensemble Young and Sexy-- than part of some prevailing, blog-buzzed trend. That regionalist quality manifests itself in the aforementioned supporting cast, which pulls equally from Vancouver-scene mainstays (Duffy Driediger of Ladyhawk, Veda Hille) and K Records kin from across the border (Rose Melberg of Tiger Trap/the Softies, Karl Blau, Mirah), plus frequent flyer Owen Pallett.</p>
<p>It's essentially Krgovich's version of the 6ths' <i>Wasps' Nest</i>, one where he gets to upgrade his lo-fi indie-rock heroes from a Motel 6 to a penthouse at the Hilton-- but has them sleep alone. Because Gigi understand that the most important period-era sound to capture here isn't a ""Be My Baby"" kick-drum boom or a Bacharachian bossa nova swing (though both are in full effect), but rather the sound of repression-- of forcing a smile while your heart sinks, of maintaining appearances while you're dying inside.</p>
<p><i>Maintenant</i>'s best songs stretch the distance between what is said and how it's expressed, like the way <i></i>Sydney Vermon and Marissa Johnson's ""I'm Not Coming Out Tonight"" channels its post-breakup desperation into a heavenly orchestral ascension. Liberated from Ladyhawk's anguished grunge, Driediger proves himself a surprisingly gentle crooner on the charming boys-do-cry serenade ""The Hundredth Time""; Mirah shows she's game for a Supremes-style romp on ""Won't Someone Tell Me?""; and, in the wake of the conceptual intricacy of <i>Heartland</i>, it's a revelation to hear Pallett in affectingly somber piano-balladeer mode on ""I'll Quit"".</p>
<p>However, if Gigi wanted <i>Maintenant</i> to truly resemble an early-60s artifact, they would've been wise to trim the 15-song tracklist to a more period-appropriate 10. For an album that's steeped in anachronistic detail-- jukeboxes, drives to ""lookout point"" and listening to ""'Mockin' Bird Hill' on the radio'""-- the references to club lighting guys and shopping malls on Joey Cook's ""One Woman Show"" feel more 1993 than 63, a quality reinforced by the fact the song sounds a lot like an early Liz Phair track. And beyond this incongruity, there are redundancies; Melberg's ""Alone at the Pier"" pales next to the similarly Spectorized ""No, My Heart Will Go On""; and in the lonesome Bacharachian ballad department, Katie Eastburn's po-faced ""The Marquee"" can't match the understated camp of Parenthetical Girls frontman Zac Pennington's ""Dreams of Romance"". Still, as a paean to the past, <i>Maintenant</i> sounds right in the here and now-- because for all their vintage dressing, Gigi are ultimately most interested in the bad romance that makes our present so tense.</p></div>"|13970.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13970-maintenant/|7.2|Stuart Berman

The glinting guitar and twisty vocal harmonies of opening track ""Vinterbarn"" establish the album's gusty cadence, but piano ornaments keep it from stagnating. The songs finally begin to run together in the final third or so, but it's gorgeous and clever throughout.</p>
<p>Massed, ethereal singing dominates, half the time in wordless harmonies; the other half in winsome folk-pop verses. It's indebted to Scandinavian folk music, but might remind North American listeners of Thom Yorke, or Neil Young at his most otherworldly-- especially on the lingering ""Milo"". Fredrik rely heavily on finger-picked arpeggios, textured finely with reverb effects. Minimal electronic rhythms pulse through lean, cavernous arrangements. There are waltzes and ballads, chased with trip-hop and synth-pop. The songs come together like puzzles, the pieces scattered on the floor and gradually snapped together in way that feels both meticulous and organic.</p>
<p>Fredrik's best songs have the haunting depth of medieval folk and the towering, evolving feel of post-rock. The sound quality is always pristine-- you can tell they slaved over each part to get it <i>just right</i>. Their guitars plink and ripple like thumb pianos. Mournful horns and cellos blur into eerie digital loops. A couple of songs seamlessly turn folk into Notwist-style electronic anthems: ""Holm"" does so by cranking up epic bass synths, ""Flax"" with pillowy beats and aquatic themes. It's forceful, sensuous music with a refreshing clarity of intention. And if you don't mind an emphasis on tone over hooks, it's very rewarding.</p></div>"|13939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13939-trilogi/|7.0|Brian Howe

<p>Johnny Cash recorded most of the tracks for the fifth and sixth installments of his <i>American Recordings </i>series between his wife June Carter Cash's death in May 2003 and his own just four months later. He was in poor health, and the effects of Shy-Drager syndrome prevented him from working most days. But when he felt up to it, he recorded; when he felt too weak, he wished he were recording. The able-bodied <i>A Hundred Highways</i>, released in 2006, was the first product of all that working and wishing, and <i>Ain't No Grave</i> is now the second. It doesn't tell us anything we didn't already know about Cash in his final months, nor does it sound like an attempt to re-brand an icon or re-shape a legacy. Instead, it plays like a desperate means of keeping Cash alive just a little longer. As such, it may say more about producer Rick Rubin, who has guided this series for 16 years, than it does about Cash himself.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Rubin comes across as deeply sentimental and fashions <i>Ain't No Grave</i>-- rumored to be the final installment in the series-- as a tearjerker. Listen as Cash ponders the delicate seam separating life from death on his own arrangement of ""I Corinthians 15:55"". Listen as he reminisces sweetly about life and love on Kris Kristofferson's ""For the Good Times"". Listen as he realizes he has a long past and little future on Tom Paxton's ""Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound"". It can be manipulative and obvious: Just the title of ""I Don't Hurt Anymore"" looms ominously on the tracklist. Cash's weak but determined performance aside, it's meant as a beyond-the-grave pronouncement, a consolation from the afterlife. The song itself was never about heaven. It's about numbness as a salve for heartache, so in this context it feels like<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span> a</span></span> great tune that cannot carry such a heavy conceptual burden. Between that and all the other tracks about mortality, <i>Ain't No Grave</i> has the feel of a séance-- morose and possibly even staged.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And yet, we want to believe. We want Cash to go out on top, with a strong batch of songs created in the interval between hardship and grace. Even so, it's hard not to question some of the choices made in assembling and arranging these new songs. The album begins with its two clumsiest tracks: Cash's vocal is strong on the title track, weaker on Sheryl Crow's ""Redemption Day"", and here's where Rubin shows his influence over the project. He overloads both with goth-country instrumentation meant to recall ""The Man Comes Around"" and ""God's Gonna Cut You Down"", but the nail-in-coffin percussion, the eerie organ, and the blues guitar playing through an old radio all sound like clichés by now. The Old Testament ambience has lost its impact, contrasting sharply with the hands-off approach that defined the first and still best <i>American Recordings</i> album.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">When Rubin leaves the fire and brimstone behind, <i>Ain't No Grave</i> picks up considerably, revealing itself as a personal rather than preacherly album. Even in those final days, when his spirit was strong but his voice weak, Cash remained a charismatic and commanding singer, with an easy gravity and a friendly, grandfatherly presence. He draws out the long syllables and sustained vowels of Bob Nolan's ""Cool Water"" gracefully and even joyfully, and sounds particularly invigorated on Joe ""Red"" Hayes and Jack Rhodes' ""A Satisfied Mind"" (given the relative robustness of his voice, the track actually seems like it's from a different session altogether). And of course, it wouldn't be a final <i>American Recordings</i> album without a weepy send-off. No one, not even Cash, could pull off Ed McCurdy's ""Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream"" without sounding sappy, and Queen Lili'uokalani's ""Aloha Oe"" is the studiously unsentimental sentimental send-off we all knew was coming. <i>Ain't No Grave</i> isn't really Cash's farewell as much as it is Rubin's memorial mixtape.</p>

Or, at least, a living. When advance mp3 ""Walls"" started showing up in bit.ly links late last year, its horns and jittery piano made Merge labelmates Spoon an easy first reference. A more revealing comparison, however, may be Lou Reed and John Cale's ""Work"", which reportedly gave Shout Out Louds' third album its title. From 1990 collaboration <i>Songs for Drella</i>, the Reed-Cale song is a manic, edgy portrayal of Andy Warhol's blue-collar Pittsburgh work ethic that sounds best on undistracted listens. <i>Work</i>, by contrast-- all innocuous midtempo thrum and vague yearning-- will be pleasant enough soundtrack bait, but it suffers from the bland risk-averseness that can sustain careers while smothering creativity.</p>
<p>Still, having a job at all is cause for celebration these days, and Shout Out Louds have tightened their belts accordingly. <i>Work</i> scraps the Cars synths and trashy Lower East Side glamour of 2003 debut <i>Howl Howl Gaff Gaff</i>, along with the orchestral lushness of 2007 follow-up <i>Our Ill Wills</i>, both at least co-produced by Peter Bjorn &amp; John's Björn Yttling. In his chair is Phil Ek, who worked wonders for Built to Spill, the Shins, Fleet Foxes, and Band of Horses. Ek makes Shout Out Louds sound like rock'n'roll pros, with every drum hit or tastefully atmospheric guitar lead in its right place, especially on a decent stereo. Dude obviously knows harmony, and his best call is bringing keyboardist Bebban Stenborg's tender backing vocals more to the front.</p>
<p>Under Ek's guidance, Shout Out Louds have also cheered up a little. Adam Olenius' high, light vocals lose some of their sensitive quaver-- just the change you'd expect when a band leaves twee-friendly Stockholm to record in Seattle with an indie-rock guy who came up in the 1990s. More broadly, <i>Work</i> replaces <i>Our Ill Wills</i>' open-wound heartbreak with wistful nostalgia. When the choruses are big and the memories relatively specific, as on Phoenix-cosmopolitan opening pair ""1999"" and ""Fall Hard"", that's a fine change. But by the bazillionth time Olenius repeats, on strummy sixth track ""Throwing Stones"", ""I'm not slowing down,"" well-- it sounds like he's trying to convince himself.</p>
<p><i>Work</i> finds these former Next Big Things railing against maturity while tacitly embracing it. The title of lulling finale ""Too Late, Too Slow"" pretty much sums the album up. Olenius may want us to ""Show Me Something New"", but those ringing chords and ignorable lyrics are commercially palatable without a hint of novelty or much personality. ""Even if I know that you're right, I'll still go on,"" Olenius retorts again and again on ""Four by Four"", as if to unseen parents suggesting he find a normal job, before repetition runs yet another solid chorus into the ground. String-flitting anthem ""Moon"", meanwhile, gives us the album's most unexpected moment-- unless you encountered any aspect of pop culture in vampire-friendly 2009: ""Have you ever tasted young blood?""</p>
<p>For the 21st century's ""creative class"" of young professionals, <i>Work</i> raises bigger questions, ones that very few-- Warhol, Reed, and Cale, I hope, among them-- have ever been able to answer successfully. Questions like: When does making a living with your art require such inoffensiveness that it's no longer art? And: At what point does getting by mean being untrue to yourself? Thankfully, Shout Out Louds aren't there yet. But they're closer than they were three years ago. ""I play the game,"" Olenius confides. ""Are you the same?"" <i>Work</i>, as the TV dads say, is work.</p></div>"|13805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13805-work/|5.4|Marc Hogan

Of those hours, about 5%-- or 11,000 full clock turns-- are spent in a state somewhere between slumber and alert, when you're not sure where you are or what day it is or if that lingering dread is real or just a remnant of a nasty dream. Detroit-raised, Brooklyn-based 27-year-old Holly Miranda's debut album is the soundtrack to that uncertain limbo. The double-edged realm is depicted on the cover of <i>The Magician's Private Library</i>, which shows a young girl lying on the grass with arrows surrounding her body. ""Every time I go to sleep I kick and scream and dream a little bit/ Violently awakening to what's real is really bullshit,"" sings Miranda on the LP, her bluesy wonder of a voice bringing the alarm clock's evil chime to life. This is also music to fall asleep to-- soothing thanks in part to producer Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio, who helps to provide pillowy, languid atmospherics. But whether the resulting zzz's are peaceful is another matter.</p>
<p>Miranda currently resides in Brooklyn, but she doesn't fit the Brooklyn mold in 2010, which is defined by noisy, lo-fi bluster on one end (Crystal Stilts, Vivian Girls) and picayune intricacy on the other (Grizzly Bear, Dirty Projectors). She's a bona-fide singer-songwriter who can and will simply sell a song around just her voice and the sound of an acoustic guitar. In this way, she's more akin to Jeff Buckley-- who gigged relentlessly with nothing more than his guitar and a vast catalogue of disparate songs before his break-- than the alternately kooky, maudlin, or devastatingly scared Cat Power, to whom she's often compared.</p>
<p>Miranda's sense of wounded mystery and her sometimes surprising choice of covers bolsters comparisons to Buckley, who dealt with his own half-awake thoughts on <i>Grace</i>'s ""Dream Brother"". Recently, she's reworked Lauryn Hill's <a href=""http://vimeo.com/6592382"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ex-Factor""</a>, Buckley's own <a href=""http://vimeo.com/7788931"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lover, You Should've Come Over""</a>, and, most surprisingly, Tool's <a href=""http://vimeo.com/9306988"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ænema""</a>. ""It's a bullshit three ring circus side show,"" she seeths on the Tool cover, a sentiment not terribly far removed from her ""reality as bullshit"" stance on <i>Library</i>. Because while the album's airy arrangements and gentle flourishes make it perfect for ""very special"" moments on cheesy hospital dramas, Miranda's mature, world-weary inflections bring everything-- nightmares, hopes, loss-- to the fore. (Notably, the recording of the album was financed by publisher Chrysalis Music, who helped nab a ""Grey's Anatomy"" placement for Miranda's old band, the dutiful guitar-rock act Jealous Girlfriends.)</p>
<p>Her crackling vocals lend themselves to murkiness and intrigue, and <i>Library</i>'s best tracks bring those traits forward. On the twinkling ""Waves"", the singer is stoic in the face of loss: ""Where do the waves go, my love?"" she asks, while the swirling music hides a wicked, unseen undertow. And her breathy sensuality makes ""Slow Burn Treason""-- a duet with TV on the Radio's Kyp Malone-- and ""Canvas"" simmer. When she sings ""Curl yourself around my frame/ Our canvas is still one that's blank,"" she recalls Sade's effortless cool. Elsewhere, sprightly and cloying arrangements bring Miranda out from the shadows, but the exposure does her no favors on ""Sweet Dreams"" and ""Everytime I Go to Sleep"". And synthetic ""Kashmir""-like touches turn the pun-filled ""No One Just Is"" into an instant trip-hopping relic. While Miranda is gifted with Buckley's soulful earnestness, she doesn't have his range.</p>
<p><i>The Magician's Private Library </i>isn't an attention-grabbing debut in the plain sense. The best moments drift along naturally and without hassle. And there's an inherent modesty involved in Miranda's personality as a performer. All that makes her a welcoming, supremely likable figure, but it also puts her in danger of blending in with her surroundings-- whether it be a bustling cafe or a too-easy TV spot. That half-awake state that greets us each morning can be intoxicating, but eventually we have to decide whether to hit snooze or stumble into the shower.</p></div>"|13964.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13964-the-magicians-private-library/|6.7|Ryan Dombal

Riding a steady trip-hop inspired groove, the hushed and mostly mellow <i>Eyelid Movies</i> seems a fine companion piece to a long stroll or something more sedentary and meditative; point being, it sounds great in the background.</p>
<p>But lean a little closer and you'll find plenty about <i>Eyelid Movies</i> to get swept up in. Behind the synth wash are shades of Portishead crackle, Dust Brothers clutter, even a little late-era Yeah Yeah Yeahs geek glamour. ""Street beat"" seems to be a nice way to gloss over the fact that this is, at its core, a trip-hop record, a genre that Massive Attack's latest seemed to suggest had moved well past its use-by date. But <i>Eyelid Movies</i>, although decidedly a nighttime record, doesn't lean on heavy-lidded noir or string-led psychodrama to get its grooves across. It gets messy, sweet, and a little weird; with most trip-hop, the best you could hope for would be two out of three. Try ignoring <i>Eyelid Movies</i> too long, and something will reach out and shake you a bit.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, opener ""Mouthful of Diamonds"", which matches an alluringly buzzy backdrop with Sarah Barthel's breathy vocal. You could just as easily get lost in her voice or trip out on the oddly loping, slightly off-kilter synth line that underpins the whole thing. Or the ratchety thunk of ""When I'm Small"", which suggests a funky <i>Odelay</i> cut as sung by Martina Topley-Bird. Rife with sonic detail but not overrun by it, they'd still be fine songs without all the toppings. But Barthel and partner/producer Josh Carter find ways to dress the songs up without weighing them down. They can be emotionally affecting-- the ""should've been easier on you"" chorus of the Carter-sung ""Turn It Off"" is a heartbreaker-- and they can be just plain strange. The xx, with their slinky trickle of spy guitars and frequent collision of boy-girl vocals, are probably Phantogram's closest contemporaries, but there's a self-serious intensity in the xx that's lacking here. It's hard to imagine Romy and Oliver from the latter band pulling out the Weenish vocal of ""Running From the Cops"", and harder still to imagine them pulling it off without cracking a rare smile.</p>
<p><i>Eyelid Movies</i> runs a tad long. This many breakbeat-based numbers in a row can be numbing, and the strong currents of melody that run over the first two thirds of the LP subside a bit toward the back, giving way to atmosphere. And Carter doesn't have quite the voice Barthel has, a fact of which he seems aware. He's smart to dress his voice up in effects, and smarter still to spend so much time singing in tandem with Barthel. But the best bits of <i>Eyelid Movies</i> show range and attention to detail, so it's hard to care when they downshift into waves of serpentine sound. <i>Eyelid Movies</i> is a sumptuous, seductive record, easy to let fall into the background, sure, but easier still to fall into.</p></div>"|13954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13954-eyelid-movies/|7.5|Paul Thompson

A collaboration between the husband-and-wife duo Colin Newman (Wire) and Malka Spigel (Minimal Compact), and Robin Rimbaud (aka Scanner), it looked like a quick one-off. But it had its own sound, albeit one reminiscent of both Wire and very early Stereolab-- driving rhythms, strong basslines, distorted and compressed guitars, and understated vocals. With a few minor adjustments, that sound is still here on album three. Githead have expanded to include former Minimal Compact drummer Max Franken, and Spigel has gradually edged past Newman to become the primary voice of the band. On <i>Landing</i>, she handles most of the lead vocals, and though her singing style blends into the music as another part of the texture, she's a welcome contrast to the guitars, which frequently gray out in a wash of digital distortion.</p>
<p>A modest vocalist, Spigel doesn't get many showcase moments; the closest is ""Ride"", a nice change of pace that slows the tempo, dials back the density of the guitars, and focuses on her sung-spoken, Belgian-accented lyrics. Newman gets in his best vocal on the following song, ""Over the Limit"", which has the archetypal Githead backing track: guitars smearing across the bar lines, frantic, nimble drumming, and a staccato bass part backing a classic even-toned Newman rant. He gets more melodic on ""Before Tomorrow"", which stands out for possessing one of the few real choruses on the album. If there's anything Githead need, it's more variety in approach-- most of their material falls into two broad categories: Malka songs and Colin songs.</p>
<p>The opening instrumental track, ""Faster"", falls into neither category. It has no melody to speak of and comes off more like a summary of the band's peculiar groove than anything else. The droning effect of the guitars-- all that static strumming-- might be more effective if they didn't sound so rounded-off and sanded down into a blur. It saps the life out of the songs, which come off more drab than they should-- when the band coasts into the end of ""Lightswimmer"", the whole thing just sounds like mud. Any

one who's enjoyed Githead's output to this point will find things to like here, but it will take a creative jolt for them to avoid making the same album yet again.</p></div>"|13898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13898-landing/|5.8|Joe Tangari

I don't think economics or the slipperiness of mp3s will save it, so much as musicians who like the format will. It lets them say something a single track often can't, and it's hard to figure a better way to capture a snapshot of where a band is in its creative life. Based on <i>The Golden Archipelago</i>, Shearwater are perfectly served by the medium. The record has just a couple of tracks that would be especially striking outside of their context on the LP, and nothing on the level of the huge highs of 2008's <i>Rook</i>, ""Snow Leopard"" and ""Rooks"". But it's still thoroughly captivating and confident-- and one of the best recent examples of effective sequencing.</p>
<p>The placement of every song is so precise that it almost sounds as though they were recorded in order. The listener feels an impeccable sense of balance as the album's loudest guitars follow its quietest whisper of a song during the transition from ""Hidden Lake"" to ""Corridors"". ""Castaways"" is deliberate and mannered and achieves the sort of restrained grandiosity that distinguishes Shearwater from nearly everyone else-- it carries you to a peak, and the song that follows gently carries you away from it as it bobs in on a swaying, natural beat. The album's first three songs feel almost like a suite. Hovering over all the perfect transitions is songwriter Jonathan Meiburg's loose unifying theme, islands. That seems simple enough for a concept, but it's a natural extension of Meiburg's fellowship work studying daily life in remote communities, as well as his well-documented interest in ornithology and academic work focusing on migration patterns.</p>
<p>Indeed, the record is introduced by a field recording of what sounds like an island choir, before the band kicks in with an oceanic swell of guitar and imagery of waves on the shore. Meiburg's voice is finely honed, and it's the primary reason the band is frequently (and justifiably) compared to Talk Talk-- he has the same richness, range, and inexact enunciation that made Mark Hollis so enigmatic and interesting. He belts powerfully on the intro to ""Black Eyes"" before he's joined by a weighty beat that subtly shifts beneath him as the bass line evolves and the drums gradually change their emphasis. It's a sharp arrangement that doesn't do anything overtly odd but makes the song captivating and exciting nonetheless.</p>
<p>The only parts of the album that don't feel quite as balanced as their surroundings are ""God Made Me"", which lacks the fluency of the record's other songs and weighs down the middle a bit, and the final two tracks: ""Uniforms"" is okay on its own, but its extreme dynamic range and slow start leaves the already wispy closer ""Missing Islands"" feeling, well, like an island, divorced from the rest of the record. Even so, it's a great  piece of work, capturing a band at a moment of creative confidence and maturity. The band's organic incorporation of marimbas and other mallet percussion, its use of acoustic instruments to create textures, its sense of restraint-- these are all well on display on <i>The Golden Archipelago</i>. It's an album you can spend time with and understand as a whole work, and one that grows on you with each listen, revealing yet more detail and nuance.</p></div>"|13934.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13934-the-golden-archipelago/|7.9|Joe Tangari

Since 2003, he's been plugging away at an ambient style that is emotionally broad but conceptually narrow. There's only so much you can do with a palette limited to light classical instrumentation and drifting electronics, and Cooper's done most of it. <i>An Accidental Memory in the Case of Death</i> was a collection of Erik Satie-inspired piano pieces. <i>When I Live By the Garden and the Sea</i> drenched similarly plaintive melodies in radiant streams of noise. <i>Copia</i>, his greatest and most fully realized album, was full of hulking themes for strings and winds, while <i>Miniatures </i>(released under his real name) was tiny and fluttering. <i>Life Through Bombardment</i>, the deluxe vinyl box-set collecting his entire oeuvre up to 2009, was more than a collector's item-- it seemed to put a completed body of work to rest.</p>
<p>Whatever his approach, Cooper always goes hard for the same matrix of emotions-- melancholy, wistfulness, yearning-- and those of us who love his music cherish this predictability. His sound has an emotional intensity that is almost unseemly, evocative of heartbreak. That hasn't changed on <i>Similes</i>, his first post­-<i>Bombardment </i>album, although the intensity is muffled to make room for delicate new elements: soft, stitchy percussion and Cooper's own laconic vocals. In a distant way, these are pop songs: Verses and choruses revolve slowly through wafting electronic sheens that glint with naturalistic piano. But his voice is so subdued and intermittent that it doesn't scan as a lead. It's just one slowly beating, spreading element among others.</p>
<p>Cooper's singing is weary and muted, in the neighborhood of Ian Curtis or Matthew Dear. He murmurs, so you catch only snatches of what he's saying, which seems appropriate in Eluvium music, always peacefully fragmented. His voice sits still amid the ruffling synths and pin-drop drums of ""The Motion Makes Me Last""; the piano keys do the real singing. Cooper's affecting vulnerability is really pronounced on ""Weird Creatures"", where he cautiously treads the chords like slippery stones over a river. He was wise to limit the vocals to a few tracks, as they're not dynamic enough to withstand a whole album. Much of <i>Similes </i>is more standard, wordless Eluvium fare: the rumbling piano-based ""In Culmination"", the slow-burning ""Nightmare 5"" and ""Bending Dream"", and most of all the long, flickering closer ""Cease to Know"".</p>
<p>Whether <i>Similes </i>will truly wind up being the start of a new career phase or a footnote for Eluvium remains to be seen-- Cooper sounds so tentative about his singing that it won't be shocking if he follows it with a more characteristic album of instrumentals. If he continues to strive for pop forms, he may have to figure out how to make his voice do more than color his arrangements in monotonous shades. If not, <i>Similes </i>will retain value as more than a curio for its sheer approachability and its unique take on Cooper's well-established style.

Hunkering down at home with his acoustic guitar, he returned to the country blues he had abandoned years before when a teacher told him it wasn't worth trying if he couldn't sing. Woodshedding diligently, Rose became a masterful finger-style player, adept at bluegrass, ragtime, pre-war folk, Indian ragas, and more-- and started a solo career that would eventually make other employment unnecessary.</p>
<p>His timing was fortuitous. The 1990s/2000s resurgence of John Fahey as an underground guitar hero inspired reams of skilled new players, including Glenn Jones, Ben Chasny, Harris Newman, James Blackshaw, and Nick Schillace. Rose became one of the<i> de facto</i> leaders of this loose movement, and his music seemed to grow and expand because of the company, or perhaps the competition. Each subsequent solo album revealed advances in technique and imagination, culminating in 2005's wide-ranging <i>Kensington Blues</i>.</p>
<p>Rose also toured and collaborated more frequently as the decade progressed, sharing space and sounds with everyone from Mogwai to British folk legend Michael Chapman to Black Twig Pickers, a bluegrass offshoot of Pelt. That's why the shock of his sudden death last December at age 38 was so resonant, rippling through the many corners of underground music he had visited. That shock is even more palpable now that his final album, <i>Luck in the Valley,</i> has been released. It's a big, bold work, just the way Rose was a big, bold guy-- confident, honest, and forthright, sometimes to a fault, but always with huge heart.</p>
<p>This forceful poise is what distinguished him from his predecessors and peers. Though his playing was often intricate and subtle, it was never hesitant, always supremely assured. And <i>Luck </i>in particular was intended to be big. As Rose told <i>Foxy Digitalis</i> in 2007, ""<i>Kensington Blues </i>is a really hard record to live up to. So [the next one]'s just gotta be really good.""<i> </i>Indeed, he outdid himself-- <i>Luck </i>isn't just good, it's great. And it makes the stunning silence of his absence, already as large as his burly persona, feel even larger.</p>
<p><i>Luck</i>'s size comes from the diversity of its sounds and the wealth of its partnerships. Rose winds through a range of instrumentation and lineups, adding the braying fiddle of Mike Gangloff (of Pelt and Black Twig Pickers) to the hoe-down of ""Lick Mountain Ramble"", the downbeat banjo of Glenn Jones to the wistful ""Moon in the Gutter"", the ragtime piano of Hans Chew to the woozy waltz of W.C. Handy's classic ""St. Louis Blues"". But the jumps in style and context never jar, making the album less like a compendium then a suite of related themes. Many ideas and moods make up those themes, but the one that stands out most is joy. Rose injects a celebratory energy into every note, so even the most wistful moments-- my favorite is his poignant slide guitar on ""Woodpiles on the Side of the Road""-- sound excited by the mere fact of their own existence.</p>
<p>Of course, it's easy to see the work of those no longer with us through a sentimental prism, letting emotion bleed over into the perceived profundity of the music. But <i>Luck in the Valley </i>is so vibrant, engaging, and alive, it's hard to overestimate it. In fact, we've been robbed of how much greater it would sound if we could look forward to Rose playing these songs live, or building on them tomorrow the way he did yesterday. But no matter what the past has taken or the future holds, this is simply great music from a great musician. That, luckily, is something that neither life nor death can change.</p></div>"|13950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13950-luck-in-the-valley/|8.2|Marc Masters

In fact, much of the former Moldy Peach's latest album, <i>Minor Love</i>, finds Green trying to obstruct the persona he's spent almost a decade fine-tuning. As occasionally funny as he was while cloaking his emotions with crudeness and junk-pop crooning, he was rarely as forthcoming as he is on his sixth solo outing. <i>Minor Love</i> suggests Green is interested in sometimes actually saying what he means, even if it's usually about how unavailable he actually is. ""I had to be the schmuck who tries to be smart,"" he explains on highlight ""Stadium Soul"". At least this time, he doesn't need a Wayne Newton parody about a hooker to tell us.</p>
<p><i>Minor Love</i> also finds Green in a different headspace musically as well, ignoring a long-standing predilection for cleanly expressed pop. Instead, the minimalist approach he takes with most of these songs-- with their simple constructions and complete lack of production value-- confirms an interest in a rawer feel. Part of this might also have something to do with Green retroactively slipping into the skin of the leather-jacketed SoHo rocker he might have secretly always wanted to be. Single ""What Makes Him Act So Bad"" boasts a frighteningly good Lou Reed approximation, playing like a gem of an old Velvet Underground demo. ""Stadium Soul"" and ""Give Them a Token"" both share a similar downtown-cool appeal, yet still retain a helpful bit of the sweetness and whimsy found in Green's earlier work.</p>
<p>It's on these tracks that Green really hits his mark, now posing like those old New York City contemporaries of his did a decade ago (a time he spent famously dicking around in a Robin Hood costume). So it's a little disappointing to see him lose sight of this for the remainder of the album, filling in the gaps with paced acoustic tunes and the occasional weird one-off. There's even a handful of surprisingly appealing urban cowboy ballads, most of which would seem less out of place if there weren't as much authentic investment in their dusty-trail aesthetic. From the ominous but goofy showdown vibe of ""Buddy Bradley"" to the bizarre campfire tale ""Boss Inside"", what seems like ripe pranking ground for Green results in a few pleasant left turns, even if they ultimately don't end up sticking.</p>
<p>Despite its strong first quarter, <i>Minor Love</i> fails to stick. Though there's a nice sense of humor throughout, there's just not enough meat on the bone to inspire any sort of real investment in the majority of these songs. They're simple, fuzzy, and occasionally quite hooky, but most lack any sort of magnetic element that would require a second spin. You hate to admit it, but at least the old Green had a little shock value to fall back on when things came out a little watery. And even though it's fun to watch Green turn a wacky phrase or brighten things with a peculiar image, it's pretty clear that Green still prefers hiding behind the obtuse vagary he's grown so accustomed to. ""I've been too awful to ever be thoughtful,"" he confesses on opener ""Breaking Locks"". A lot of <i>Minor Love</i> suggests otherwise-- I just wish he could've rolled with it.</p></div>"|13943.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13943-minor-love/|5.7|Zach Kelly

From the earliest Velocity Girl singles to last year's Pains of Being Pure at Heart full-length, its records share an affinity for washes of reverb, bubblegum melodies, and shoestring-budget production. Even their most recent records have an aged patina to them, as if every album they were ever going to release was recorded in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>The debut by Bay Area all-woman trio Brilliant Colors could, therefore, not have found a more appropriate home. Its 10 tracks zoom by in barely more than 20 minutes of urgent, fuzzy guitars, muffled vocals, jangly melodies, and burning, vital percussion. The band has boiled their influences down to their most essential ingredients-- a C86 jangle, shouty, atonal no-wave singing, a shoegaze saturation of echoing guitars. The LP strikes a surprising balance between faux-naïveté and knowing grit, punk toughness and twee tenderness, vintage sounds and vibrant novelty.</p>
<p>The songs' brief run-times are Brilliant Colors' biggest strength and their most unfortunate weakness. There is a fundamental vibrancy to a track that blasts by in less than two minutes. Nothing is superfluous; everything sounds fresh and crucial. And Brilliant Colors' brevity is the source of, if not their wit, then at least their terse, maddeningly obtuse yet strangely specific lyricism. But alternately, it is difficult to develop an emotional attachment to a song that is over before you know it began. And it becomes difficult to make a distinction between many of the songs, because they are never really given a chance to blossom into memorable hooks or to rev up to distinct speeds. (One exception is ""Absolutely Anything"", a punk-sock-hop interpolation of Nena's ""99 Luftballons"".) This makes for the strange problem of mostly indistinguishable songs that, ironically, combine to form a memorable overall album-listening experience.</p>
<p><i>Introducing</i>, therefore, does exactly what its name implies: announces the arrival of a new noise-pop talent without giving too much away. It's a scrappy record that relishes contradictions, layering gentle vocal melodies over gritty industrial distortion and charging eagerly ever forward toward the next over-too-soon track. It is an alluring collection that hints at greatness but halts at achieving it, instead teasing listeners for its sequel. <i>Introducing</i> may not be the in-depth introduction that we might want, but it is a suitable prologue for a band that has taken that old vaudevillian advice to heart: always leave 'em wanting more.</p></div>"|13961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13961-introducing/|6.8|Rebecca Raber

Where 2004's <i>The Milk-Eyed Mender</i> was an unusual record with its share of quirks (her squeaky voice and fondness for arcane language, the harp), it also had its simple pleasures. Most of the tracks were short and the sound was spare; you pretty much liked it or you didn't based on how you felt about Newsom's sound and her ability to put a song together. <i>Ys</i>, on the other hand, was unapologetically dense. The five songs averaged more than 10 minutes each, and through them Newsom sang continuously; Van Dyke Parks' arrangements were similarly relentless, seeming to comment upon and embellish almost every line. It was a rewarding album-- filled with memorable turns of phrase and impressive storytelling. Many were enthralled, and almost everyone at least admired it. But in comparison to <i>Milk-Eyed</i>, <i>Ys</i> took some serious work to crack. So when I heard that Newsom would be following it with a 3xLP set called <i>Have One on Me</i>, I had troubling visions of 25-minute songs with lyrics that stretched to 5,000 words.</p>
<p>As it turns out, <i>Have One on Me</i> is a ""triple album"" in the vinyl sense, in the same way that the Flaming Lips' <i>Embryonic</i> is a ""double album,"" even though it fits onto one CD. There are 18 songs here, and they total about two hours. To pick a couple of reference points from the CD era, that's the same length as Smashing Pumpkins' <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</i>, and just a bit longer than Biggie's <i>Life After Death</i>. Two hours is a lot of music, but having it broken into three discs, each the length of a 1970s LP, helps. You can dip into <i>Have One on Me</i> at a given point, listen for a while, and move on to something else. But while the album invites sampling, I've found myself returning to a different section each time I sit down with it. The highlights are spread out evenly, and Newsom couldn't have sequenced the record any better.</p>
<p>While songs here evoke moments of <i>Ys</i> and <i>Milk-Eyed</i> and Newsom's harp is still the dominant musical focus, it's striking how much <i>Have One on Me</i> feels like its own thing. Not a progression, exactly, more of a deepening. You can feel roots going down and an edifice being built. Her voice has gained depth and she sings with more force and clarity, so that's part of it. And the arrangements are more judicious and draw less attention to themselves (some tracks are just harp, others add horns, strings, and percussion, but with a lighter touch). But the bigger difference seems to be the overall mood, which is expansive and welcoming. The best songs feel more like conversations rather than artworks to be hung on the wall and admired from several paces away. Newsom seems to sing from somewhere deep inside of them, and her earthy presence has a way of drawing you in, bringing you closer to her music than you've been before.</p>
<p>The name you'll most hear in discussion of this record is Joni Mitchell. Part of it is that Newsom can sound a fair bit like her with her more richly textured voice. Sometimes, almost eerily so, like on ""In California"" (the way she wraps the vocal melody around the evocative title word is just a few miles up the PCH from <i>Blue</i>'s ""California""). In addition to her voice and phrasing, the more approachable songs here, from the stirring harp-and-voice ballads ""Jackrabbits"" and ""Esme"" to the funny, weird, and hugely appealing road song ""Good Intentions Paving Company"", have bluesy chord progressions that stand in stark contrast to the rigid folk modes of <i>Ys</i>. These songs sway and heave with a warmth and approachability that are new for Newsom. They, and several others like them, offer a fresh way into Newsom's music for the curious.</p>
<p>""The phantom of love moves among us at will,"" goes a line in ""Esme"". Most of the songs here deal with love in some form, another quality that connects <i>Have One on Me</i> to the broader singer-songwriter tradition. Sometimes the love is romantic; other times its about friendship or family. Newsom sometimes approaches the subject from her elliptical perch, talking in pictures-- ""Each phantom-limb lost has got an angel (so confused, like the wagging bobbed-tail of a bulldog),"" is the line that follows the one above in ""Esme"". But though Newsom indulges her gift for imagery early and often, <i>Have One on Me</i> has moments of simplicity and directness, where the tangled phrases can be boiled down to, ""Life can be difficult and lonely and we all need love, but holding on to it can be hard.""</p>
<p>One significant difference between Newsom and Mitchell is that the latter, especially early in her career, was writing songs that would sound good on the radio. For better or worse, Newsom is not a pop singer-- that's just not what she does. So I don't want to overstate this record's accessibility. A few tracks here, especially longer ones like the title track and ""Kingfisher"", approach the winding density that marked <i>Ys</i>. On these, song structure is elusive-- at any given moment you're not sure if you're listening to a verse, chorus, or bridge. The lyric sheet helps a bit, but with two hours of music to digest, you won't feel too guilty about using the skip button here and there, or digesting the record in pieces. Helpfully, returning to the most immediate songs causes their charm and appeal to bleed into the tracks that surround them-- so the album seems to grow and change as you listen.</p>
<p><i>Have One on Me</i> begins with ""Easy"", about a wish for the kind of life the title suggests, and closes with ""Does Not Suffice"", which finds the narrator packing up a house to leave after a breakup, putting away all that reminds her lover of how ""easy [she] was not."" The latter is subtitled ""In California, Refrain"", it uses a similar gospel-inflected progression as the earlier song, and it's flat-out gorgeous, heavy with sadness (""the tap of hangers swaying in the closet"") but also exhibiting quiet dignity and strength. It's my favorite song here, and it comes last, which is a dependable sign that I'll be returning to an album often. When I hear Newsom sing the word ""easy"" in ""Suffice"" and my mind jumps back to the opener, it reinforces just how many threads she's weaved between those songs and how incredible it is to discover new things with every listen.</p></div>"|13960.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13960-have-one-on-me/|9.2|Mark Richardson

It's not a comeback in the sense of being a return to form or a drastic departure, but it is a promise that prolific frontman Eef Barzelay won't have to go it alone again. <i>Hungry Bird</i>, a shoulda-been swan song that was initially abandoned mid-record because of the band's slow dissolution, was issued a year ago with news that Clem Snide would press on. So while <i>Meat of Life</i> should get a little burst of energy coming from a band returning after being so near the end, it winds up being a plodding next step from a group that once got by on its smirk and quickness.</p>
<p>Lambchop's Mark Nevers again handles production duties, and much like <i>Hungry Bird</i>, <i>Meat of Life</i> finds Clem Snide deserting wily, irreverent arrangements and witty aphorisms in favor of a more earnest and streamlined sound. Even Barzelay's voice-- once bursting with character, unafraid of the occasional pubescent crack or gargle-- now sounds subdued and polite.<i> Hungry Bird </i>was ostensibly about a break-up, and while this record digs into love and lust from a few different angles, it's hard not to notice that the guy sounds not only a little burned, but just plain burned-out. Even from its title, ""Wal-Mart Parking Lot"" might seem pretty over the plate, but Barzelay plays it straight: She bails, he drives all night and ends up watching the sunrise outside of a Supercenter, and he still can't manage to find any irony in the commerce of love.</p>
<p>The band also sounds like the wind has been taken from its sails, rarely finding a way outside of the same waltzy, indie-pop ballad structures. Most of the songs have such a predominant lite-rock FM quality to them that even the occasional lilt of a lovely cello part or the blast of a trumpet (far too rare here) is unable to rise above the din. Even the when the songs do branch out, it's usually in an unbecomingly strange direction. The album bookends ""With Nothing Much to Show for It"" and ""Anita"" (the latter of which boasts an ""Anita""/ ""I need ya"" rhyme, just in case you wondering how completely uninterested Barzelay is in being clever) have a weird and lonely calypso vibe, sounding like ballads for the only guy at Sandals without a date to the Luau. Strangest of all might be the title track, a lucid bit of blacklit space folk that somehow manages to make the cosmic beauty of conception sound frighteningly repulsive: ""To grow the meat of life, I will plant my seed"".</p>
<p>It's disappointing that Clem Snide seem to have nestled into a very comfortable, moth-eaten place, and it's sadder still when you can hear Barzelay's sense of humor worming it's way in, most notably on ""I Got High"". Dedicated to ""all you beautiful American girls and boys"", ""I Got High"" is a warm, nostalgic look at those fumbling adolescent escapes into love and drugs. It's wistful, in part because you can sense the ""old Barzelay"" returning. That tug in his voice makes me think that he misses that guy a little bit, too.</p></div>"|13928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13928-the-meat-of-life/|5.3|Zach Kelly

He carries that momentum into his first commercially available DJ mix, the 50th (!) installment of London nightclub Fabric's ongoing series. A beguiling and sometimes difficult mix, <i>Fabric 50</i> showcases Martyn's increasingly divergent interests, touching on all manners of UK dance subgenres.</p>
<p>Martyn gets tossed in with the dubstep crowd, but as Philip Sherburne noted in his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12883-great-lengths/""><i>Great Lengths</i></a> review, Martyn's productions incorporate elements of Detroit techno and house music and feature dance-friendly tempos. <i>Fabric 50</i> features some of dubstep's current powerhouses, but they are mostly those whose music is already amenable to the floor: Zomby's siren-laden raves and Joy Orbison's soulful spinning. <i>Fabric</i> does serve as a departure for Martyn, though, as it leans heavily on the growing UK Funky movement, a branch of garage music that incorporates contemporary R&amp;B as well as African and Caribbean rhythms. Tracks by UK Funky mainstays Altered Natives, Cooly G., and Uncle Bakongo are included.</p>
<p>This makes <i>Fabric 50</i> a challenging, idiosyncratic blend, especially for the Fabric series, which usually leans heavier on techno (sister series FabricLive is more groove oriented). It also makes for some extremely interesting juxtapositions. Martyn wastes no time on pleasantries, opening with four minutes of Hudson Mohawke and Olivier Daysoul's ""Joy Fantastic"", which comes out of the gate winking and laughing. It's a risk that Martyn continues to trade on through the first third of <i>Fabric</i>'s 65-minute runtime, segueing into the busy, shallow percussion of Nubian Mindz's ""Bossa Boogie"" and the Soca-flavored bounce of Maddslinky's ""Lost on Tenori Street"". During one of the album's most impressive stretches, Martyn mixes Zomby's ""Little Miss Naughty"" into the humid percussion of Uncle Bakongo and then leads us into another Zomby track, the clubby headrush of ""Light Cycle"".</p>
<p>These early minutes are both fascinating and confounding: Though the mixing is impressive, Martyn offers few footholds, instead subjecting listeners to 20 minutes of clacking percussion. He makes amends in the middle of the mix, offering Joy Orbison's ""BRKLN CLLN"", Roska's remix of his own ""These Words"", and Martyn's remix of the Detachments' guitar-led ""Circles"", the melodicism of which is almost jarring after the percussive opening sequence.</p>
<p>The mix's final third is a blend of choices both inspired-- Actress' ""Slowjam"", Levon Vincent's ""Air Raid""-- and confusing. SpaceApe's Rorschach-ranting on a Ben Klock remix of Martyn's ""Is This Insanity?"" (SpaceApe's unsurprising answer: yes) seems like a poor fit with <i>Fabric 50</i>'s overall tenor, while Jan Driver's hardcore-infused ""Rat Alert"" and Dorian Concept's shifted house chords on ""Trilingual Dance Sexperience"" close the mix how it began: surprisingly abrupt uptemo jamming.</p>
<p><i>Fabric 50</i> is one of the most intriguing and risky mixes you're likely to hear this year, but it's also a harsh and tricky set. Martyn is a tremendous DJ, sliding between genres and shedding new light on his own work as he casts it amongst the set here. <i>Fabric 50</i> is a slippery overview of both Martyn's developing skill and of current UK dance trends, one that requires thoughtful attention before it pays off.</p></div>"|13956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13956-fabric-50/|6.8|Andrew Gaerig

These studio auteurs may wander between genre borders, but their penchant for listenable electro-pop offset by voices (almost exclusively female) tinged with melancholy tends to help make their albums feel like organic units rather than tossed-together jumbles. Not so with Kasper Bjørke, whose vocal-aided tracks are odd and disparate and whose instrumental cuts are even more schizophrenic.</p>
<p><i>Standing on Top of Utopia</i> is Bjørke's second full-length release under his birth name, following 2007's equally haphazard <i>In Gumbo</i>, and it's full of tantalizing moments that never threaten to coalesce into something resembling a coherent whole. The album's first track, ""Animals"", is disconcertingly cool and minimal, nicely throbbing electro-pop that nonetheless feels out of place as an opener. ""Young Again"" is equally disquieting thanks to vocalist and songwriter Jacob Bellens, whose brooding, loud voice contrasts oddly with the song's romantic words (Bellens appears again on ""Alcatraz"", where his deep voice comes off cheesy delivering serious lyrics).</p>
<p>The best vocal cut by far is ""Efficient Machine"", which successfully blends post-punk steeliness with pure disco pleasure much in the same vein as LCD Soundsystem, complete with irresistibly slippery bass, handclaps, and cowbell. It's bookended by the album's two best instrumentals-- ""Dasko Vanitas"", which features muted disco guitar plucks bleeding into techno, and ""Melmac"", a woozy jam that touches on mutant disco. On the whole, however, <i>Utopia</i> has a haphazard feel-- it moves from piano-driven disco vamp ""Alcatraz"" to the darkly foreboding instrumental ""Great Kills"" to a cover of the forgotten Rolling Stones' gem, ""Heaven"".</p>
<p>Bjørke closes <i>Utopia</i> with a pair of tracks every bit as unexpected and awkwardly fitting as the two that began it. The glitchy ""Fido &amp; the Friendly Ghost"" nods both in title and tenor to Bjørke's minimal house side guise, Kasper Bjørke &amp; His Friendly Ghost, while the beatless, burbling ""Fasano"" ends things on an expectant but unresolved note. Bjørke is clearly an artist-producer who likes to put his finger in lots of different pies, and he should be commended for such restlessness and flexibility. Still, it would be nice to see him pursue some of these avenues a bit more thoroughly as opposed to cramming so many detours into one 48-minute trip.</p></div>"|13945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13945-standing-on-top-of-utopia/|6.1|Joshua Love

Named after a Serge Gainsbourg song, winsome indie poppers Sambassadeur won't shake up any Sarah Palin fan's European stereotypes.

One part ABBA, one part C86, the fragile, idyllic pop of 2005's self-titled debut translated naturally to a studio and the lusher production of Dungen's Mattias Glavå on fine 2007 follow-up <i>Migration.</i> The new album doubles down on an aesthetic that should appeal to fans of Camera Obscura, the Clientele, or the Concretes, resulting in Sambassadeur's most consistent full-length to date, even if its peaks don't quite match earlier highlights like ""Between the Lines"", ""Kate"", or ""Subtle Changes"", marred in part by occasionally generic lyrics.</p>
<p>As with generations of Swedish popsters before them, Sambassadeur excel at picking up sounds from the U.S. and UK and refining them to their catchy essence. When <i>European</i> is at full gallop, making loneliness almost cheerful on first single ""Days"" or another album highlight, ""Sandy Dunes"", it's pretty tough to beat: Those horns! Those strings! That piano opening! Where <i>Migrations</i> quotes Pavement and includes a Dennis Wilson cover, Sambassadeur's latest sprinkles its lyrics with well-selected phrases from Nick Drake or James Bond movie titles (though you probably enjoy them more if you don't realize it). Plus there's a hushed, intimate rendition of Tobin Sprout's ""Small Parade"".</p>
<p>For all that, it's hard to pinpoint moments when <i>European</i> rises beyond ""pleasant"" or ""comfortable"" to something transcendent. While the slower songs may drag on early listens-- hint: try speakers instead of headphones-- ""Albatross"" eventually emerges as the closest thing. ""I was happier alone/ Cut my hair just like a boy,"" sings frontwoman Anna Persson, her voice full and conversational over <i>Astral Week</i>s-style upright bass. It's a moment that more than makes up for every ""ivory skyline of your smile"" or ""pine trees like paintings."" Put down your protest signs, people: There's still so much we could learn from each other.</p></div>"|13932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13932-european/|7.0|Marc Hogan

And that's just <i>Hidden</i>'s first two tracks. Raise your hand if you thought These New Puritans had it in them. Just two years ago, the band from Southend-- a UK borough set where the Thames meets the North Sea-- took a stab at Gang of Four rhythms and Mark E. Smith vitriol. Their debut album, <i>Beat Pyramid</i>, made interesting uses of negative space and some of the record's spartan tracks turned up as killer remixes. But if anything, TNP were late to the post-punk revival party and about as likely to author a grandiose and triumphant concept album as Glasvegas.</p>
<p>And yet <i>Hidden</i> is a strikingly inventive and original rock record. Granted, nothing is ever completely new in pop music, but the album freshly synthesizes older ideas (post-rock textures, no-wave skronk, Steve Reich-influenced phasing) and current trends (dubstep's delay, chart pop's stentorian synth lines, global beats). You have to listen really hard to hear any guitars. Similar to contemporaries Sigur Rós, Nico Muhly, and Joanna Newsom, These New Puritans challenge classical and popular value distinctions by fully integrating a 13-piece orchestra. A clutch of melodic motifs and variations weave through <i>Hidden</i>, keeping the song set extremely tight and aesthetically cohesive, so when ""Orion""'s rabid beats and gothic choir feed into orchestral palette cleanser ""Canticle"", the transition is fluid and unpretentious.</p>
<p>That's not to say the record is particularly organic-sounding. TNP frontman/songwriter/arranger Jack Barnett has plotted this work of sonic theater to the smallest detail for the biggest bang. ""Attack Music"" pits dancehall horns against massive beats and cooing female voices against Barnett's arch sing-speak. If possible, the drums, played mainly by Barnett's brother George, are even more spectacular on M.I.A.-shoutout ""Fire-Power""-- a track which simulates the crushing of a human skull with a cracker-wrapped melon. Drums, in fact, are so central to <i>Hidden</i>, that Liars comparisons are unavoidable. Barnett credits Benjamin Britten's 20th century opera <i>Peter Grimes</i> as an influence (it was inspired by the same estuary region TNP call home), and <i>Hidden </i>seems to drive at some sort of human/natural world showdown. Given the fact that we're perched on the precipice of ecological Armageddon, it's probably safe to say the band has appropriately scaled their sound to their subject.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: While<i> Hidden</i>'s risktaking and relentless focus are easy to admire, they're harder to love. As Leonard Cohen's ""Anthem"" famously goes, ""There is a crack in everything/ That's how the light gets in."" Good luck finding <i>Hidden</i>'s cracks. Still, the record rewards dedication: Beneath the bombast, the playful piano-driven ""Hologram"" is human, even vulnerable, and the electro-pop contribution ""White Chords"", with its Thom Yorke-channeling vocals, is unexpectedly lovely.</p>
<p><i>Hidden</i> is a statement, but not a manifesto. A band needs considerable imagination and skill, not to mention borderline delusional levels of ambition, to attempt this kind of project and hope to be successful. So we probably won't be hearing a lot about new genres ""doombeat"" or ""woodwindwave"" anytime soon. And now that they've shown what they're capable of, we can probably expect TNP to do something totally different, if not genuinely amazing, next time around.</p></div>"|13951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13951-hidden/|8.2|Amy Granzin

Perhaps that's due to other band commitments; perhaps because Quasi rarely perform outside of the band's Portland hometown. (Though they are about to embark upon a fairly extensive tour in support of this new effort.) Or perhaps it's because Quasi's lyrical content-- from the overt politics of <i>Hot Shit</i> to the silly-yet-obtuse children's poems of <i>When the Going Gets Dark--</i> can be too arch for some. Or maybe it's just that the band's tricky mixture of jazzy piano honky-tonk, Southern blues guitar, and rambling psychedelica is a jarring concoction that can, for some, be an acquired taste. Whatever the reason, it seems like even the band's best reviews seem to note the band is unlikely to convert new fans.</p>
<p>Well, that is not the case with <i>American Gong</i>. The band's eighth album (and first with bassist Joanna Bolme) is both a summation of its career and an accessible introduction for new listeners. <i>American Gong</i> showcases Weiss' textured, musical fills and muscular beatkeeping and Coomes' bar-piano melodies and bent-note blues guitar riffs. But here they focus on those strengths and boil their songs down to their most essential ingredients: knotty, seasick melodies, heavy riffs, surprisingly sugary harmonies, and virtuosic drumming.</p>
<p>Quasi have always been enamored of repetition, both lyrically and musically, but often to a monotonous effect. Here that becomes a draw. ""Laissez Les Bon Temps Roulez"", a mid-tempo rocker featuring barely more than its titular lyrics, makes Coomes' nasal, keening delivery as much a part of the song's syrupy groove as Weiss' undulating drum rolls. And the fuzzy guitar arpeggios anchoring ""Bye Bye Blackbird"" and cyclical structure and central refrain of ""Rockabilly Party"" accomplish the same thing.</p>
<p><i>American Gong</i> is also blessedly free of typical Quasi jams-- which work live, but can drag on record. There are still lurching, aggro guitar solos and hints at foundations for what will become showcases for improv on tour, but the album's arrangements are simplified and mostly serve their vital hooks. There are some surprisingly quiet moments-- from the subtle, acoustic track ""The Jig Is Up"" to the mournful opening of piano-peppered ""Everything and Nothing at All""-- that show off the band's dexterity. But with an experimenter's adventurous spirit, they eschew pure prettiness by adding a shambolic solo or acidic harmony to keep things from getting predictable. And 16 years into their career, that's a valuable thing. Here, a rewarding one, too.</p></div>"|13942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13942-american-gong/|7.2|Rebecca Raber

Though certainly drawing from the roots music of the Southern U.S., they are equally entrenched in mead-soaked English folk, classic rock, and psychedelia. For each woolly bit of boogie, there's a supporting cast of trippy flute accents, backwards guitars, and ramshackle nods to mod rock and paisley-patterned freakouts. All of which work together to produce a number of catchy stompers on the band's first full length, <i>Tidings</i>.</p>
<p>But as much as <i>Tidings</i> rides high on it's own brand of sweaty juke-joint appeal, its finest moments are a grab bag of genre detours. ""Black Water"", a crunchy slab of drug-rock steeped in mystic imagery (it sounds only a little bit like a Spinal Tap song), works more like a Renaissance Faire theme than a muscular blues number. ""Cotton Strands"" is a Love-styled bloomer bursting with sitars and flutes, yet it still manages to retain the feeling of a creepy backwoods séance. ""Untitled"" acts like the perfect introduction to both <i>Nuggets</i> and LSD, and late album cut ""Empty Heart"" boasts a strut that has T. Rex stank all over it. And there's plenty of brawniness to go around, too, like the single ""October Fires"", which is a wild, noodly groover, detailing some sort of sacrifice ritual over a sweaty honky-tonk rhythm, harmonica, and punchy guitar details.</p>
<p>Thing is, <i>Tidings</i> isn't the tight rock record it appears to be. Almost half of the songs are tagged as interludes, most of which are field recordings or outtakes of aimless strumming, strange whirrings, and drunken ramblings. Frontman Jack Sharp made these recordings between 2005 and 2007 in Bedford, England, before the current iteration of Wolf People. So in a sense <i>Tidings</i> serves as more of an odds-and-ends collection than an album proper. Though occasionally a particularly strange piece of noise or a tasty riff will manage to prick up your ears during these sections, they seriously hamper the movement of the record. While the patchwork construction does unintentionally remind you of a live set (one that's obviously just lousy with tech problems), skipping through the dodgy one-offs and tepid noise detours will leave you with only a handful of tracks worth holding on to.</p>
<p>Most of the proper tunes succeed because they roll along so eagerly, so it's hard to imagine why Wolf People would sap the album of all its momentum with these little speed bumps. If these experiments weren't so dull and scatterbrained, they'd at least serve as a sort of counterweight to the rockers, making the good stuff really pop. But the full-band cuts don't need a push. Ditch the interludes and you have yourself a hot, swampy EP full of terrific little boogie-minded gems.</p></div>"|13921.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13921-tidings/|6.4|Zach Kelly

Yet Memoryhouse are so chill on their debut EP they're practically glacial. In contrast to the kinetic early single ""Radium Girls"", the songs on <i>The Years</i> offer a less festive take on the past than many of their sand- and surf-loving contemporaries.</p>
<p>The relatively somber approach works to <i>The Years'</i> benefit, lending it a more classic, polished feel than other sample-indebted releases. Due to their limited recording budget and ever-present drum machine, the band may technically fit the definition of lo-fi; however, Evan Abeele and Denise Nouvion's ethereal dream-pop hints at loftier ambitions. At times, <i>The Years</i> plays like a shoegazer record minus the feedback, leaving just the reverbed loops and frostbitten vocals behind.</p>
<p>Opener ""Sleep Patterns"" is one such somnambulant gem-- its sputtering beat, never quite rousing, always purposely lags two steps behind. Further underscoring the heavy-lidded, dream-like state is Nouvion's eerily affectless timbre, caught somewhere between a soft coo and spoken word. The vocals may not be in tune, though they do seem appropriate in their disconnect from the melody, suggesting a kind of suspended animation. ""To the Lighthouse"", <i>The Years</i>' standout final track, continues the EP's lethargic and oceanic themes but adds an ever-so-slight twang to its gentle ebb. Nouvion, meanwhile, flattens her tone even further, as she dispassionately describes the sensation of drowning. It's a testament to her calm delivery that she manages to make lungs filling with water sound not only serene but downright seductive.</p>
<p>Belying its title, <i>The Years</i> almost sounds cut short: four tracks in just over 12 minutes, with one song, ""The Waves"", acting as little more than an extended segue. Yet the songs fit together seamlessly, and the fact that a full-length is planned for May suggests that <i>The Years</i>' brevity is by design, not due to any shortage of material. Most importantly, the EP clearly sets Abeele and Nouvion apart from their more amateur peers. <i>The Years</i> may be awash in nostalgia, but far from inviting unfavorable comparisons, it mostly confirms that the past was indeed as good as you remember.</p></div>"|13946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13946-the-years-ep/|7.3|Jonathan Garrett

The Brooklyn-based, Berklee-educated foursome surely aren't the only music lovers who self-identify that way these days-- even <i>beyond</i> their home borough. Based on the recent chart successes of Vampire Weekend, Grizzly Bear, and Animal Collective, a growing portion of U.S. record buyers now think a lot like critics. If widespread connoisseurship leads to more adventurousness inside and outside the mainstream, as Solange Knowles' Dirty Projectors cover or Antony Hegarty's Beyoncé cover appear to portend, then the stage could be set for some of the weirdest and most exciting pop in ages.</p>
<p>As <i>Animalore</i> shows, however, the new snobbishness isn't always for the best. That's a shame, because the mature, earnestly proficient folk-pop of Via Audio's first LP, 2007's <i>Say Something</i>, was mild-mannered to a fault. Again produced by Spoon's Jim Eno, <i>Animalore</i> keeps its predecessor's smooth gloss and evident chops, demonstrating why Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla was an early supporter, but adds touches of funk, R&amp;B, and cloying humor. With songwriting that veers between snoozy and face-palming, it's the kind of sophomore album that makes you question whether the debut deserved so much love in the first place. To paraphrase <i>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</i>, true expertise is knowing there's a whole lot we don't know.</p>
<p>For instance, I don't know how much it matters that <i>Animalore</i> shares its name with a rare 1953 ""animalanthology"" featuring Lewis Carroll. If there's a concept here, it's subtle: ""The Lizard Song"" ably ventures into tropicalia; ""Tigers"" rides an indie pop groove but catches its tapping toe on Mother Goose-like rhymes. <i>Animalore</i>'s charms are subtle, too, but easier to find. Spoon's Eno establishes a dubby sense of space beginning with the jazzy chords and thick bass of coolly seductive opener ""Hello"". Co-songwriter Jessica Martins' light, versatile voice should please fans of former tourmates Headlights, particularly on acoustic-to-technicolor finale ""Happening""-- the album's best song. Martins also keeps the Fleetwood Mac-dreaming ""Summer Stars"" and castanets-kissed ""Wanted"" from collapsing underneath their complex arrangements. She can't save ""Goldrush"", which sounds like a 1970s-era ""Sesame Street"" ditty about the Olympics, but its hook should be sharp enough to catch some listeners.</p>
<p>When Via Audio engage with recent chart pop, though, they bring an ironic distance that can be... off-putting. It's hard to imagine anyone would actually ""want to make babies"" to first mp3 ""Babies"", which turns the sci-fi synths and slinky rhythms of a Timbaland production into wry parody. ""Digital"" adopts the deadpan electro of LCD Soundsystem to broach the shocking revelation that pop stars use Auto-Tune: ""It doesn't even matter how good you are,"" co-songwriter Tom Deis sneers, aghast. It's sad and embarrassing hearing complaints about ""something 12-year-olds will like"" from a band that elsewhere sings, ""Olga, the poetry of music rises like the ashes of a life before I knew you."" As long as pop is going to encourage us would-be connoisseurs, here's hoping it doesn't forget about the 12-year-olds-- or the 17-year-olds, either.</p></div>"|13877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13877-animalore/|4.8|Marc Hogan

Not that it's particularly hard to describe, with its improvised electronic squiggles, dubby synth noise, criss-crossing drum machines, and zombified moans. But explaining their music by cataloging the sonic elements is like saying water tastes like hydrogen and oxygen. It doesn't catch the magic of Excepter's alchemy, how they move between comatose meandering and inspired epiphany so seamlessly it's hard to decide which is which.</p>
<p><i>Presidence, </i> a 130-minute 2xCD set filled with half-hour-plus pieces, doesn't really make the Excepter formula any more transparent. Nor should it-- I doubt these magicians are particularly interested in revealing their tricks. But <i>Presidence</i> offers clearer evidence of how the band's process doesn't depend on specific sounds or formats. Put simply, Disc One is mostly classic Excepter, and Disc Two is mostly something else. That both are equally stubborn, challenging, and interesting shows how sturdy their approach is. Currently a six-piece, Excepter continue to reorganize themselves into new shapes and sizes without losing their core identity.</p>
<p>If you're already familiar with that identity, you might want to start your <i>Presidence </i> experience with Disc Two. All four pieces there explore new sounds, and each feels more repetitive than previous work, more interested in riding out one pattern or beat than morphing through several. Most striking is the title track, a 33-minute solo synth odyssey crafted by founder John Fell Ryan back in 2003 (as the press kit puts it, the band's ""pre-war"" days). Ryan's creative process usually manifests itself in his edits of Excepter source material, or in his mesmerizing vocals. But here we get a glimpse of his improvising methods away from his bandmates, and the result is practically an album unto itself.</p>
<p>Like a meditative amalgam of spacey Krautrock, Terry Riley's ""all-night flight,"" and the synth escapades of Oneohtrix Point Never, ""Presidence"" moves from clusters of starry notes to big swaths of electronic noise and drone. Yet Ryan glides through it all with a stubborn anti-logic in line with Excepter's established M.O. The same is true for Disc Two's other experiments, as the band's weird sense of timing unites tracks as disparate as ""Anti-Noah"", an ambient piece dominted by weather-report samples, and the robotic, Residents-on-downers ""Open Well"".</p>
<p>Disc One's sounds are more familiar, but Excepter's ways of getting in and around them are just as idiosyncratic. The first half, a somnambulant half-hour suite called ""Teleportation"", gurgles through rattling drum-machines and low-end rumbles, reaching highest when Ryan and his co-singers Lala Harrison and Clare Amory wrap their hums together. The suite never quite wakes up from its subdued dream-state, but Excepter's woozy rainbow brightens on ""Og"", mixing a loping beat, melodic synth waves, and chilled vocals into an oddly catchy New Age jam.</p>
<p>That may sound like a bit of a niche pleasure, and ultimately <i>Presidence</i> stands closest in Excepter's oeuvre to 2007's <i>Streams </i> (the aforementioned double-disc of podcast mixes), both best suited for the converted. This is, as the band calls it, ""long distance music""-- sounds that take a while to absorb, and work better out on the horizon rather than up in your face. But while <i> Presidence </i>may keep its distance, it's never hard to enter, and individual pieces are as intriguing by themselves as they are in the album's wide-open context. In that sense, maybe every Excepter album should be called <i>Streams-- </i>the band's vision channels varied sounds and ideas into something worth wading through.</p></div>"|13929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13929-presidence/|7.1|Marc Masters

For nearly a decade, Pearson has lent his considerable talents as a producer to both crossover dance-rock stars and folks who predate the rave era entirely. Perhaps these musicians, who live between pop and club life, are drawn to someone who gushes over Radiohead and St. Vincent as well as Âme and Radio Slave, someone with an up-to-the-minute knowledge of dance trends as well as an understanding of what makes trad songwriting tick.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that Pearson's released his latest mix CD on Kompakt, a label that's spent the last 12 years turning avant dance music into a kind of pseudo-pop, and vice versa. During the first wave of microhouse, which it helped pioneer, Kompakt also released cheeky Madonna interpolations and chanteuse-techno hybrids that verged on outright tweeness. And as minimal techno's deep-underground hit a fallow patch mid-decade, Kompakt remained friendly enough to attract the attention of both <i>Spin</i> magazine and the Pet Shop Boys, among thousands of others.</p>
<p>Much of Pearson's <i>We Are Proud of Our Choices</i> hearkens back to the label's earliest days, its micro-era clicking and snapping, while retaining at least a flicker of that now near-mythical Kompakt glow. A_Idric's  ""Birds on Tree"" pairs the melancholy of Gas' string samples with scissor-sharp percussion. Wah Chu Ku's ""T Times Too"" recalls a more minimal Plaid, its cool-breeze synth gusting over stiff house drums.</p>
<p>But Pearson's tracklist also eschews both songs and pop remixes,  the two choices that still guarantee a look-in from an audience with limited time for instrumental techno. Vocals surface mostly as ghostly shudders and robotic punctuation on tracks like Hot Natured's ""Equilibrium"" and Xenia Beliayeva's downright spooky ""Analog Effekt"". Perhaps true to his nature as a regularly gigging DJ, Pearson affirms himself as a drums man here, a fan of gleaming Euro-techno snares, static-ridden electro kicks, deep house woodblocks, and beyond. Pearson manages to choreograph rhythms of all sorts-- both rigid and fluid, ugly and beautiful, straight banging and downright delicate-- into one slowly unfolding dance.</p>
<p>Pearson's range isn't surprising; <i>Choices</i> is now the third mix to show off his enviably wide-eared listening habits. Perhaps that's why, if <i>We Are Proud of Our Choices</i> is occasionally dark, it's also never alienating or pointlessly sparse. A sensualist rather than an acetic technician, Pearson expertly juggles the astringent and the voluptuous, even when we're just talking drum sounds. None of the tracks leap out on first listen as obvious show-stoppers, but Pearson's nonetheless collected the most rhythmically diverse selection of tracks to appear on a Kompakt-branded mix in quite some time. We're lucky to have him, out there patrolling the border between hard and soft, rhythmic experiment and low-key pleasure, pop and underground.</p></div>"|13948.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13948-we-are-proud-of-our-choices/|7.0|Jess Harvell

Rather, it's a play at quaint family businesses run by real people in real small towns, trades passed down through generations: both independent (yes, as in indie) and commercial. It's a shallow cry of authenticity, but this West London quartet really does sound more like a business than a band, supplying value-added products at discount prices. Their debut, <i>Sigh No More</i>, is stocked with group harmonies straight from the Fleet Foxes warehouse, exaggerated earnestness on consignment from the Avett Brothers, some of the same rock ""real""-ness that built the Kings of Leon brand, second-hand drama from that run on Keane a few years ago, and some insistent Gomez rusticisms gathering dust in the back room. It's not spot-the-influence if they're pushing them on you with a salesman's insistence.</p>
<p>Mumford &amp; Sons take an emporium approach, with an inventory that's broad but never deep. By spreading their attention around so many different trends, they aim to do many things adequately-- perhaps to distract you from an inability to do any one thing especially well. They love big moments and acoustic instruments, so you might call what they do hoedown pop, although that might be giving them too much credit: Every hoedown on <i>Sigh No More-- </i>every rush of instruments in rhythmic and melodic lockstep-- conveys the same sense of hollow, self-aggrandizing drama. And they pull that shit on every track.</p>
<p>Among the predictable crescendos, there are some unexpected textures, mostly courtesy of some guy calling himself Country Winston playing banjo and dobro. And they contain hints of Celtic melodies in songs like ""Roll Away Your Stone"" and ""Thistle &amp; Weeds"", like they might be trying to update Fairport Convention and Pentangle. But none of these ideas is fully developed or explored, the gestures fleeting at best.</p>
<p>For music that ostensibly prizes the appearance of honesty and confession, <i>Sigh No More</i> sounds surprisingly anonymous, giving a sense of the band as engaged music listeners but not as real people. Mumford paints himself a sensitive guy put upon by insensitive lovers: ""Tell me now where was my fault in loving you with my whole heart,"" he whines on ""White Blank Page"", as the music swells and ebbs to exonerate him of any misdeed or misunderstanding. Worse is ""Little Lion Man"", which is already a hit in Britain but sounds overly self-absorbed in its insistent mea culpas, as if admitting wrongdoing is a noble gesture: ""I really fucked it up this time, didn't I, my dear?""</p>
<p>When Mumford &amp; Sons stray from their tales of romantic martyrdom, the results are actually worse. Late in the album, ""Dust Bowl Dance"" kicks up some American Gothic ambience with what sounds like the least believable stab at a murder ballad ever set to record. ""I'll go out back and I'll get my gun,"" Mumford sings, like a man who had never handled a firearm in his life. ""I said, 'You haven't met me, I am the only son.'"" When the Sons' electric guitars finally kick in, the song descends from ill-advised to downright embarrassing. Live, it's probably their closer, but ""Dust Bowl Dance"" hints that Mumford &amp; Sons are in the costume business. They're playing dress-up in threadbare clothes.</p></div>"|13906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13906-sigh-no-more/|2.1|Stephen M. Deusner

But the clip at which they've arrived lately seems almost superhuman. And while he's not immune to the occasional failure, since late 2008 or so Pollard has enjoyed a late-career renaissance, consistently rewarding those of us still paying attention.</p>
<p>Messy though the sonics can be, there is something very deliberate about the construction of Pollard's recent work; even last summer's haywire <i>Elephant Jokes</i> felt like an attempt to capture the clipped construction of his muddy mid-90s masterpieces. <i>We All Got Out of the Army</i>, his first solo album of 2010, is a gleaming and hefty glam-pop record without the rough patches and rushed moments and that can bog him down, and it's among his most deliberate yet.</p>
<p>""Silk Rotor"" starts the album with an amicable enough guitar chug before exploding into a weighty stomp; after a string of fine LPs with less than stellar first tracks, it feels good to dive right into this one. ""Post-Hydrate Update"" lopes around into a nice series of hooks, and the thwacky ""Your Rate Will Never Go Up"" is similarly catchy. ""On Top of the Vertigo"" is one of Bob's best vocal performances in years, the gnarly track thrashing against an aside-laden tale of ""sleeping in a puddle of puke."" ""How Many Stations"" is a true lighters-in-the-air moment, while the manic title track might well inspire a mosh pit should this new studio rat incarnation of Pollard tour again. And ""Wild Girl"", a stripped-bare piece of melancholia that suggests Syd Barrett doing ""Across the Universe"", might just be the best tune here.</p>
<p>A fine lot of Pollard songs is one thing, but it's gotta sound right, and right-hand-man Todd Tobias, working from his new studio, lends these numbers just the right amount of flash and grit. Unlike last year's <i>The Crawling Distance</i>, which found Tobias dressing up a drab grab-bag of Pollard tunes in the most utilitarian arrangements imaginable, the music here works against the songs beautifully. It's fuller, brighter, more nuanced, and more natural, closer to the much-loved <i>Isolation Drills</i> than almost anything else that's come since. And Pollard actually straps on a guitar and lets a few solos fly, a show of effort and personal involvement practically unheard of in the period immediately following Guided by Voices' split. Pollard's a loopy guitar player, favoring feel over form, but his personal touch helps to offset Tobias' steady hand.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be a Pollard record without inspiring a raised eyebrow or two. The not quite right ""Rice Train"" is a little too weird to be wonderful, and ""Talking Dogs"" feels slight, as befits the set's shortest number. A few tunes, while not exactly sleepwalkers, seem driven by autopilot. Most egregiously, ""I Can See"" nicks the central riff from Pollard's best and most recognizable song, <i>Bee Thousand</i>'s ""I Am a Scientist"", pretty much wholesale; it'd be a lousy trick if the tune that followed weren't pretty good, although, of course, ""Scientist"" it ain't. But if we're getting to a point where the worst thing you can say about a Bob Pollard record is that it's got a tune that reminds you of his best work, well, clearly we're getting somewhere. Last year was a good one for Pollard, and with a record like <i>We All Got Out of the Army </i>coming right out of the gate, 2010 is shaping up nicely.</p></div>"|13937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13937-we-all-got-out-of-the-army/|7.3|Paul Thompson

That was in 1961. From ""Yes, I'm Lonesome Tonight"" to ""You Know I'll Love You Tomorrow"", ""Roll With Me, Henry"" to ""Wearing His Rolex"", songs that respond to other songs have long been a lively pop tradition. In 1995, German reissue label Bear Family put out a three-volume compilation series, <i>And the Answer Is: Great Pop Answer Discs From the '50s and '60s</i>. It shows that as engrossing as the answer record trend can be, most of the records themselves are for obsessives only.</p>
<p>Eddie Argos is such an obsessive. The plucky raconteur for UK rockers Art Brut has always portrayed himself less as a pop star than as the ultimate fan, whether California dreaming about Axl Rose on 2004 debut <i>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll </i>or belatedly discovering the Replacements on last year's <i>Art Brut vs. Satan</i>. And, as titles like ""Pump Up the Volume"", ""Nag Nag Nag Nag"", ""Twist and Shout"", and ""The Passenger"" may indicate, Art Brut were already making ""answer songs"" of a sort.</p>
<p>Everybody Was in the French Resistance... Now! is Argos' band with Dyan Valdés of L.A. group the Blood Arm. Produced by former Mighty Lemon Drops guitarist Dave Newton and recorded at Joshua Tree (take that, U2!!! ...I guess?), <i>Fixin' the Charts, Vol. 1</i>, an album-length excursion into answer songs, is only the latest example of Argos' fascination with participatory culture. Too often, though, its jokes are one-note, and so are its arrangements. It's irony. It's rock'n'roll. It's a listening experience not worth repeating a second time.</p>
<p>Wisely if foolhardily, Everybody Was in the French Resistance... Now! have chosen to respond to songs already rich in history. Wisely, because it's difficult not to take ""The Scarborough Affaire"" on its own terms when the Simon and Garfunkel original was already based on a Martin Carthy arrangement of a traditional song. Foolhardily, because this approach also highlights <i>Fixin' the Chart</i>s' shortcomings: The limply parodic indie funk of ""Billie's Genes"" has nothing on earlier answer records like Lydia Murdock's Billie-Jean's-view ""Superstar"".</p>
<p>Argos is still witty, but here his punchlines tend to be predictable, due in part perhaps to the disc's overstretched answer-song conceit. I get that trying to reveal the emotional truth behind classic pop songs could theoretically be a way of giving <i>Fixin' the Charts</i> the sort of honesty about relationships that makes <i>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</i> or <i>Art Brut vs. Satan</i> stick with you for so long. But to ""fix"" the tacit anti-feminism of Avril Lavigne's ""Girlfriend"", ""G.I.R.L.F.R.E.N. (You Know I've Got A)"" would have to out-entertain her. Drunken indie-pop karaoke won't cause a generation of young women raised on Taylor Swift's ""You Belong With Me"" to stop fighting over boys and embrace girl power.</p>
<p>Then again, everybody was on the right side of history... now. When the Replacements sang about a musical hero of theirs, on <i>Pleased to Meet Me</i>/""Rock Band 2"" fave ""Alex Chilton"", Paul Westerberg rasped, ""I'm in love/ What's that song?/ I'm in love/ With that song."" On ""Hey! It's Jimmy Mack""-- in which, guess what, Jimmy tells Martha and the Vandellas he's never coming back-- Argos quips, ""It certainly didn't deserve a song."" What makes for a mildly amusing MySpace click can lead to a painfully obnoxious album. Particularly when, if you really think about it-- and I'm hardly the first person to have this idea-- <i>every</i> song is an answer song. Why else would you form a band?</p></div>"|13895.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13895-fixin-the-charts-vol-1/|3.8|Marc Hogan

<p class=""MsoNormal"">2005's <i>Perfect Pitch Black </i>followed, with little else other than talk of Cave In's indefinite hiatus. When they did return last year with the <i>Planets of Old </i>12"" it seemed more of an assurance that they're still around than proof of their artistic vitality.<span> </span>It's less of an EP, damn near single-length, and each of its four tracks is nicely compartmentalized if not terribly diverse. And now it's being released on CD, along with a live DVD of a performance last year at Boston's Great Scott.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Opener ""Cayman Tongue"", by a large measure the slowest <i>Planets </i>track, finds Stephen Brodsky and Adam McGrath careening around a time signature damn near impossible to keep track of, yet a dominating low-end provides a visceral punch.<span> </span>Halfway through its six-plus minutes, they submerge into a miasma of feedback punctuated by full-band interruptions. It's initially startling, but they sort of overplay their hand-- this section of ""Cayman Tongue"" is longer than any of the tracks that follow and the ultra-modern production smooths out most of its dynamic edge.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The remainder of <i>Planets of Old </i>plays out like a series of windsprints. The first, ""Retina Sees Rewind"", sticks a Thin Lizzy riff into an electrical socket and showcases Brodsky's nasal singing, which sounds sort of like a sedate Geddy Lee.<span> </span>It's the hookiest of the four, especially since double-kick-drum scream machine ""The Red Trail"" is aerodynamic to the point that hooks would be considered a luxury.<span> </span>The fourth and final piece of <i>Planets of Old, </i>""Air Escapes"", is a compact hearkening back to <i>Antenna</i>'s more Clear Channel-flavored stylings, loud and super-compressed but ultimately letting Brodsky's just-tuneful-enough melodics punch through.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So in a span of time slightly equal to that of a latter-day Sunn O))) track, Cave In make their case for... well, it remains to be seen whether it's brand reinvigoration or a desire to shed light on a band that was probably ""hipster metal"" before anyone knew what that really meant.<span> </span>But <i>Planets of Old </i>might be too little, too late considering how narrow its range is-- the type of listener that might've made, say, <i>Jupiter </i>their sole metal purchase of the year has far more access to extremes either in volume or melody or texture. And while <i>Planets of Old </i>doesn't demand a whole lot of the listener, Cave In were considered great in large part because albums like <i>Jupiter </i>did.</p>

Which is kind of great, if only because it prohibits us from falling back on categorizing Chaz Bundick's sound as ""beach music."" After all, chillwave was never really about the beach. Even if the springy sounds of Neon Indian and Washed Out often felt coastal and waterlogged, the style was always more about texture and atmosphere than it was about place. As Bundick told me in a recent interview, ""The beach thing is coincidental. If I look at a band like Best Coast or Wavves, they live on the beach. I go to the beach, like, once a year.""</p>
<p>The other hump to get over when discussing chillwave is the purported sameyness of the artists involved. You know, the idea that Toro Y Moi isn't really that different from Washed Out, Memory Tapes is basically an ambient Neon Indian, and so forth. This one's a little more difficult because there really are clear aesthetic similarities between these guys. Still, there are distinctions. Looking at Toro Y Moi in comparison to Washed Out and Neon Indian, the main difference is that the latter two put more of an emphasis on hooks. Their songs are generally catchier and more straightforwardly composed. Bundick, on the other hand, is more producer than songwriter. While they might lack the immediacy of a ""Deadbeat Summer"" or ""Feel It All Around"", his tracks often have deeper, more interesting layers.</p>
<p>Which approach you prefer will impact how much you get out of <i>Causers of This</i>. The album is geared more toward those who appreciate production, and in some ways is a departure from Bundick's earlier singles such as ""109"" and ""Sad Sams"". At times guitar-based, those songs were generally pretty punchy and utilized a fair amount of lo-fi tape hiss. Here, though, Bundick embraces a cleaner and mellower sound that's more indebted to hip-hop. He wears his inspirations proudly, and throughout there's a clear nod to producers like J Dilla and Flying Lotus. What he extracts from these sources, Bundick combines with his own vocals and other instrumentation to make warm, wobbly pop songs that, while not always as catchy as his contemporaries', are distinctive and appealing in their own right.</p>
<p>The album starts out strong with a string of tracks that showcase Bundick's range. First two songs ""Blessa"" and ""Minors"" exhibit his pop sensibilities, setting a wash of vocals over looped electro-funk instrumentals and crisp drum programming. Here Bundick strikes a nice balance between sticky vocal melodies and the undulating arrangements that feature through the rest of the record. On other tracks in the first half, he takes on genre experiments with similar success-- first jaunty piano soul on ""Imprint After"" and then sparkly disco with ""Lissoms"", the album's most propulsive moment. While these songs are all enjoyable, ""Fax Shadow"" serves as the best representation of Toro's potential. It's the most complex track here, and in its Dilla soul sampling and distorted beat pattern, Bundick shows production skill far beyond most of his peers.</p>
<p>Each of these songs work in a similar way. Instead of using crude production, he manipulates sounds to create texture. It's the way ""Freak Love""'s drums fall off that enhances its mood, not that they sound blown-out or tinny. This craftsmanship carries him through most of the album, but begins to fade towards the end. Bundick doesn't run out of ideas at this point, but his balance of arrangement and song feels off. ""You Hid"" is wobbly but one-note, lacking punch, and the closing title track is too cluttered. If <i>Causers of This</i> stayed consistent through the end, it might be up there with the assured debuts of his peers; instead, it's just a few notches below.</p></div>"|13931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13931-causers-of-this/|7.6|Joe Colly

In the ensuing months, brothers David and Peter Brewis kept working-- the former as School of Language and the latter as the Week That Was-- each occasionally enlisting the services of the other. And now, a couple of years later, Field Music have indeed reunited (albeit minus keyboard/utility player Andrew Moore, reportedly training to be a chef). You've got to love a band that stays true to its word.</p>
<p>Field Music last left off with 2007's <i>Tones of Town</i>, a relatively manageable 11 songs over a modest 30 or so minutes. The pair now seems refreshed and reenergized for the third Field Music LP, <i>Measure</i>-- it<i> </i>runs a staggering 20 tracks spread out over 70 minutes. Factor in the formidable arrangements, which often make a single song sound like two or three or four crammed together, and before you even press play you know <i>Measure</i> won't be casual listening.</p>
<p>In that regard the brothers Brewis don't disappoint, either. Retaining an affinity for the fussier side of XTC, Field Music values careful precision over outright prodigious velocity, which keeps their music from tipping over into the proggy abyss. Further, it laces their songs with winningly fragmented melodies that don't always resolve or even repeat but still provide a vital point of entry to the band's rigorous compositions. That's the upside.</p>
<p>The downside is that Field Music have a tendency to come off so cerebral, their charms are sometimes buried beneath the non-stop musical flourishes. Constantly inventive/evolving electric and acoustic guitar filigrees, meticulous percussion, strings, finger-snaps, handclaps, and intricate harmonies that bounce from speaker to speaker: <i>Measure</i> is, if nothing else, a truly <i>crafted</i> record.</p>
<p>In fact, <i>Measure</i> crams so many complex twists and turns into each of its tracks that it starts out imposing and rarely lets up, making it a lot easier to give up than give in. That'd be a shame, since even though the band's constant motion can be exhausting, its pleasures aren't as far-flung as they first appear. ""Them That Do Nothing"", with its interlocking acoustic guitars, steady beat, and genial vibe, is a pop gem, and the surprisingly lithe ""Let's Write a Book"" sticks to a groove long enough to prove that the Brewises understand well when to keep things simple(r). ""The Rest Is Noise"" is proud pomp that gives way to a sinewy but satisfying denouement.</p>
<p>It helps that the Brewis brothers have such a sharp understanding of space and, despite the sprawl, pacing, which is why they can get away with music this busy without completely overwhelming the listener. At times <i>Measure</i> feels like a suite, each track a separate part of the same (long) song that settles naturally into dynamic peaks and valleys. Admittedly, once closer ""It's About Time"" winds down into traffic sounds and hushed piano, you're likely to feel as much relief as exultation that Field Music made it this far without toppling off their precarious high wire and making a mess of themselves. But music this simultaneously careful and out of control would never get made if failure weren't a real risk.</p></div>"|13917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13917-measure/|7.5|Joshua Klein

In the early 1990s, she turned her cult notoriety with Blake Babies into ""120 Minutes"" buzz, and she harnessed the momentum from her 1993 decent-seller <i>Become What You Are</i> into something resembling a career. She's still going strong at a time when most of her alt-peers have long ago faded into obscurity or nostalgia tours. More than 20 years after her first recorded notes, she runs her own label (Ye Olde Records) and tours and releases albums on her own schedule. On her 10th solo album, <i>Peace &amp; Love</i>, she goes from being her own boss to being her only employee: Not only did she record and produce it herself, but she played all the instruments, including guitar, piano, drums, and bass.</p>
<p>Her DIY sensibility, still intact so deep into her career, is certainly admirable. Too bad it's not put in service of better music. With its acoustic strums and coffeehouse intimacy, <i>Peace &amp; Love </i>sounds like that stalest of 90s relics: the unplugged album. In fact, it seems to be defined by Hatfield's <span> </span>limitations rather than her strengths. Her playing is rudimentary throughout, and while occasionally that beginner's aesthetic leads to some nice moments, such as the overlapping guitar lines that open the instrumental ""Unsung"", generally it makes the absence of a full band seem like a bad idea. The lead guitar licks that open the title track are graceless and awkward; on piano, she repeats the same theme over and over until it grates; and on drums, she barely keeps time.</p>
<p>Hatfield's voice has aged well over the years-- or, more to the point, it hasn't aged at all. While her kid-sister inflection might seem to undermine the maturity of her recent output, it actually adds a new and bittersweet dimension to some of her lyrics. At least that's how 2008's pained <i>How to Walk Away</i> worked. On <i>Peace &amp; Love</i>, her songwriting sags with too many awkward rhyme schemes, clunky line meters, and come-together pronouncements. ""Why can't we love each other?"" she asks on ""Why Can't We Love Each Other?"" ""I won't give up on peace and love,"" she declares on the title track.</p>
<p>Of course <i>Peace &amp; Love</i> picks up considerably when she gets away from saving the world, but then again, the only difference between ""Butterflies"" and a middling Jewel song is history. ""I Picked You Up"" manages to devise a catchy chorus, but then runs it into the ground with too many repetitions. Some electricity might have given these songs some much-needed life, or sturdier lyrics might have given her acoustic DIY project a weightier anchor. As it is, <i>Peace &amp; Love</i> sounds like a rough draft full of rookie mistakes, rather than a veteran defiantly going it alone.</p></div>"|13862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13862-peace-love/|3.9|Stephen M.

<p>It was surprising because Gabriel seemed like the kind of artist who would remain blissfully ignorant of the changes that have befallen the music business in the years since he released his last album, <i>Up</i>, in 2002. Somewhere between the time of the smash <i>So</i> in 1986 and the launch of the Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, Gabriel seemed to transcend the pop machine. He'd undertake offbeat projects (scoring films like <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i>, making an early stab at interactive art with the <i>EVE</i> CD-ROM), release an album or two when he felt like it, mount the occasional tour, and appear on the odd film or TV soundtrack. But with his graying hair, air of intelligent dignity, and avoidance of celebrity trappings, he was the rare pop star who didn't seem to mind losing relevance or growing old. The last place you expected this guy to show up was singing lead on a blog-bait Vampire Weekend cover.</p>
<p>If nothing else, that Hot Chip cameo mitigated the shock that otherwise came with news that Gabriel's next full-length, <i>Scratch My Back</i>, would be a covers record, featuring songs by Arcade Fire, Bon Iver, Radiohead, and the Magnetic Fields, along with work by Gabriel contemporaries like David Bowie, Lou Reed, and Paul Simon. From the outset, it sounded like an idea dreamed up by a management team, a way to introduce Gabriel to the coveted New Generation of Listeners. But a recent interview on<i> The Quietus</i>, where Gabriel ran down the song selections and explained how he was introduced to each, revealed the project's organic roots.</p>
<p>The <i>Scratch My Back</i> songs are either lushly orchestrated by the Durutti Column's John Metcalfe or feature just solo piano; all are arranged in a sweeping cinematic style that steers clear of the Hot Chip collab's playfulness and humor. There's a fleeting ""Hey, neat"" factor in hearing Gabriel use his legendary ""I'm bathing in red rain"" / ""I'm shooting into the light"" upper register on lyrics by Justin Vernon and Elbow's Guy Garvey. And there's no question that the years have been kind to Gabriel's vocal instrument: he sounds ready to launch into a full-throated chorus of ""San Jacinto"" at any moment. But once the initial novelty wears off, we're left with some ponderous, dull, and ultimately pointless versions of songs that sound much better elsewhere.</p>
<p>Every song on <i>Scratch My Back</i>, regardless of its original tone or meaning, is flattened out and turned into this one melodramatic and depressing thing, often with Gabriel whispering half the words to go with the ultra-slow tempos. This uniformity of mood highlights the most puzzling aspect of the record: Gabriel's clunky phrasing. Throughout, he seems to be singing words without necessarily understanding what they mean. If you close your eyes you can almost see him reading them off paper. ""You know me, I like to dream a lot/ Of what there is and what there's not,"" he sings in Lou Reed's ""The Power of the Heart"". Heard with Gabriel's stiff delivery, the humble declaration is entirely unconvincing. His take on David Bowie's ""Heroes"", glacially slow and building to a single climax, affirms, like many failed takes before it, that the original is about 70% brilliant record and 30% brilliant song. On Paul Simon's ""The Boy in the Bubble"", the New York Knicks fan's line about a ""turn-around jump shot"" sounds exceedingly silly inside of a heavy, life-or-death funeral ballad.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that this album sounds earnest, professional, and ultimately very awkward. When the orchestra reaches yet another world-shattering crescendo on Arcade Fire's ""My Body Is a Cage"" (one more fine record that sounds melodically feeble in this setting), things almost start to drift into the campy territory of William Shatner's <i>The Transformed Man</i>. This album is called <i>Scratch Your Back</i> because all of the songwriters here will eventually return the favor and cover a song of Gabriel's, to be collected on a sequel. Here's hoping they have better luck. As for this collection, <i>Feels So Unnatural</i> wouldn't have been a bad title, either.</p></div>"|13935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13935-scratch-my-back/|4.5|Mark Richardson

Zion appeared as one of many satellite projects orbiting around the Godspeed You! Black Emperor mothership, alongside fellow offshoot acts like Fly Pan Am and 1-Speed Bike. Today, it has supplanted the long-dormant godspeed as Constellation Records' flagship act-- not just in terms of popularity or acclaim, but as outspoken exemplars of the label's uncompromised business ethics. That outcome, however, seems less the product of a grand master plan-- as legend has it, the band was originally formed by Godspeed's Efrim Menuck, Sophie Trudeau, and Thierry Amar to pay musical tribute to Menuck's recently deceased dog-- than part of a dutiful obligation to fill an ideological void in underground rock culture. Over the course of a decade when Fugazi fell silent, Touch and Go Records shut down, and indie rock became a music-supervision goldmine, Thee Silver Mt. Zion have incrementally evolved from a meditative, mostly instrumental orchestro-folk ensemble into an imposingly heavy, politically enraged rock band, with Menuck emerging as the most seething, peculiar agit-punk mouthpiece since Guy Picciotto.</p>
<p>Naturally, not all of TSMZ's early adopters have been eager to follow the band's transformation into psych-metal curmudgeons-- 2008's mordantly hostile <i>13 Blues for Thirteen Moons</i> was the band's most divisive release.<i> Kollaps Tradixionales</i> makes no apologies for this shift, but it does defuse <i>13 Blues</i>' sometimes oppressive air by reconciling the band's current incarnation with its more graceful earlier output. Because, for all the change that TSMZ have undergone in the past 10 years, their music remains rooted in the ideology of perseverance in a cruel world. That quality is reflected in the band's collaborations with various veteran outsiders (Patti Smith, Grant Hart, the late Vic Chesnutt), and in Menuck's own torn and frayed voice.</p>
<p>On 2001's <i>Born Into Trouble as the Sparks Fly Upward</i>, a young girl is heard to say, ""All we need is a little more light""; <i>Kollaps Tradixionales</i> revisits the sentiment on opener ""There Is a Light"". The song's theme of hard-won hope plays out in its structure-- a series of attempted ascensions and soft landings, each aiming higher than the one previous. With its church-organ hum, waltzing string, and brass arrangements-- and a final act where Menuck starts belting it out like David Bowie on ""Five Years""-- this side-long suite is the most genial, comforting piece of music the band has produced in years.</p>
<p>But it's also a red herring, establishing a false sense of levity on an album that grows increasingly dark and despairing. ""There Is a Light"" is immediately answered by the two-part ""I Built Myself a Metal Bird""/""I Fed My Metal Bird the Wings of Other Metal Birds"", which redirects <i>13 Blues' </i>bulldozing menace into more accelerated, exhilarating chamber-punk. The song's war-machine allusions climax with Menuck hysterically shouting, ""dance, motherfuckers!""-- revealing not so much a desire to shake our hips as to point guns at our feet.</p>
<p>If ""Metal Bird"" captures TSMZ at their most incendiary, the trio of tracks that comprise the album's third side present the scorched-earth aftermath: ""Kollapz Tradixional (Thee Olde Dirty Flag)"" and ""Collapse Traditional (For Darling)"" are somber hymns that ruminate on faded glory, before the triptych's closing piece, ""Kollaps Tradicional (Bury 3 Dynamos)"", rides a psychedelicized Celtic reel skyward and explodes into a Zep-heavy grind. But TSMZ's perpetual process of channeling frailty into ferocity-- the recurring patterns of rising and falling, flaming out and reigniting-- has had a noticeably exhausting effect on the band by the time we reach album closer ""'Piphany Rambler"". Clocking it at 14 minutes, and staking claim to the album's entire fourth side, the song charts a pained, slow-crawling course similar to that of its nomadic, mountain-climbing narrator, the severity of his journey intensified by windswept string swells.</p>
<p>And in that, it's hard not to draw parallels with TSMZ's own course-- an autonomous rock band trying to assert its ethics, ideals, and political will in an indie rock culture that seems to value those principles less and less with each passing year. But when Menuck sings, ""We crawled upside that mountain/ Down its ass and back again,"" his matter-of-fact delivery implies he's not expecting any great reward for his grunt-work. In fact, in the midst of the song's stormy finale, he pleads, ""don't take these blues away""-- suggesting that Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra are well aware their own perseverance is emboldened by the very cultural forces that threaten it.</p></div>"|13924.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13924-kollaps-tradixionales/|7.3|Stuart Berman

""If anything I want to bring myself (and my bandmates, as well as my friends and family) closer to everything I like.""</p>
<p>The interviewer had asked Feinberg about irony in his music-- specifically, how he hoped the irony of Led Zeppelin references, sizzling electric leads, and a heroic, fantasy-rock instrumental dubbed ""Vinter"" might work amidst a landscape of cynics and smartasses. After one record, it might've been hard to say much of Feinberg's intentions. Yeah, those classic riffs ruled, and the layers of warm Jethro Tull and ELO textures that he and producer (and former Fucking Champ) Tim Green stuffed into Grateful Dead-like shapes sounded fantastic. But what about that flute? And those keyboard layers and string-section sprees? He must be teasing at least a little bit, right?</p>
<p>If any doubt lingered after <i>Little Kingdom</i>, Citay's triumphant and enormous 2007 debut for Dead Oceans, then <i>Dream Get Togethe</i>r-- Feinberg's third and most expansive album as Citay-- dispels it entirely. From the Fleetwood Mac grandeur of the ballad ""Mirror Kisses"", sung by tUnE-YaRdS' Merrill Garbus, to the five minutes of instrumental swagger of ""Secret Breakfast"", <i>Dream Get Together</i> gathers the totems and taboos of 1970s rock and, as the record's title suggests, treats them all like the guests of some imagined jam session. At times, it might seem a tad cornball or cute, but Citay make triumphant, affirming music that leaves no room for irony.</p>
<p><i>Dream Get Together</i>'s closer, a cover of the 1988 Galaxie 500 single ""Tugboat"", is the most concise and accessible example. A room-filling acoustic guitar, more brisk and bold than it is schmaltzy, takes the rhythm, and a radiating electric line washes atop, announcing the theme in advance of Feinberg's, for once, dominant vocals. ""I don't want to stay at your party/ I don't want to talk with your friends/ I don't want to vote for your president,"" he sings in harmony with himself. If the original take followed those declarations with question marks or uncertain ellipses, Feinberg chases them with exclamation points. Like the Galaxie 500 take, Citay end with an extended guitar vamp. But Galaxie 500's dissonance and stuttered lines wound tightly in turmoil. Feinberg and Green whirl in delight, their foil guitars treating the exit more like a liftoff than a comedown. It just feels good.</p>
<p>That holds for much of<i> Dream</i>, too. The title track, for instance, is a total celebration-- shakers, strums, and big drums opening the door for a sharp guitar line and Feinberg's summertime revelry. In one verse, he references Neil Diamond and Steely Dan and, more importantly, details the joy of his dreams-- ""two hands out the window, two hands shifting gears."" Opener ""Careful with That Hat"" is a sidewinding epic veering between choral swells, a Motorik midsection, and a solo that sends San Francisco's past exploding into the air like sparks.</p>
<p>Through it all, Citay supply a surprising amount of editing and elegance to these jams. Just two break the seven-minute mark. When Garbus' oohs and aahs float through a thick keyboard-and-acoustic haze on ""Mirror Kisses""-- or even when the guitars lock in long, winding harmonies during ""Fortunate Sun""-- Citay remain controlled and careful. Songs are constructed so that each line plays a certain role, every note tells its tale. Maybe that's where it will lose some listeners, too: It's not tough and rough and wild around the edges like Green's old band could be, or a lot of heavy metal can be. And it's not open at the ends like jam-band music. But this is Feinberg's third album of eight tracks in about 40 minutes, all exploring the same excitable intersection of psychedelia and pop. By now, he doesn't seem to be the sort to back down from his musical decisions or not to pursue the lavish sounds he hears in his head. Good thing, too: If he did, these intense little trips would be a lot less fun.</p></div>"|13936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13936-dream-get-together/|7.6|Grayson Currin

We Say Die!-- the Canadian dance-punk quintet who had famously been barred from entering the United States for the past four years-- have finally gotten their visa problems worked out in time for the American release of their third LP, <i>XXXX</i>. Because, more than any point in their career, audiences will want to hear their new songs live. While other bands of their ilk petered out along with the intensity of the public's interest in dance-punk, YSP!WSD! have chugged along, touring tirelessly through Europe, and finally developing beyond the constraints of hi-hat 16th notes and wiry, stabbing guitar lines on a collection that encompasses both the gothic ambiance of Siouxsie and the Banshees and the tough-girl 1980s hooks of Pat Benatar.</p>
<p>At first glance the new album's title may seem like a reference to a porn rating, but the multiple titular Xs are actually acting as a stand-in for a four-letter word-- and not the one you think. As proved by opening track ""There Is XXXX (Within My Heart)"" and its repeated ""there is love within my heart, there is love, love, love"" refrain, XXXX stands for ""love,"" which attests that the band is now more interested in feelings than actions. In the past, the five-piece dwelled firmly in the realm of physical wants-- see songs like ""Cold Hands! Hot Bodies!"" and their breathless rhythms and thumping basslines. But the slower pace and more sentimental outlook of <i>XXXX</i> gives listeners the necessary space and encouragement to surrender to the band's emotional message.</p>
<p>That message, though overwhelmingly positive, is married to melodies that are antithetically moody, melancholic, and minor-key. So while singer Becky Ninkovic sounds besotted, she layers lines about the redemptive and uplifting power of love against sinister synths and the hard edges of needling, repetitive guitar riffs. YSP!WSD! have long been compared to Yeah Yeah Yeahs-- after all, both are bands fronted by strong-voiced frontwomen who possess banshee caterwauls, and both are enamored of confrontational yet danceable rhythms and arty, aggressive riffs. And much like how Karen O and her crew reinvented themselves as louche, grooving synth-poppers on <i>It's A Blitz</i>, YSP!WSD! have similarly overhauled themselves for <i>XXXX</i>. Comfortable now on gentle, prettily sung slow-burners like ""Heart of Gold"" as well as on throttling, thickly percussive barnburners like ""Cosmic Wanship Avengers"", YSP!WSD! have made something unexpectedly tender out of darkly colored and often heavily propulsive material.</p>
<p>A lot of credit goes to Ninkovic, whose voice is richer and smoother than ever on these new songs. Distancing herself from comparisons to the tarter, more prickly Karen O, Ninkovic has finally found a unique voice that is still emotive but way less shrill than before, and it adds a welcome warmth to the collection. Her voice, like her band's sound, has grown beyond the limitations of YSP!WSD!'s early genre confines, giving the band new legs. Perhaps all they needed to mature was the incentive of a now-possible U.S. tour. And, of course, a little bit of <i>XXXX</i>.</p></div>"|13918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13918-xxxx/|7.0|Rebecca Raber

He's already opened for Sigur Rós, and like them, he isn't afraid to go right for the emotional jugular. <i>Found Songs</i> collects seven compositions, mainly for piano and strings, each created and Tweeted in a single day. Appropriately, they're concise: Grand, melancholy themes explored for two or three minutes apiece, sometimes closer to etudes than songs. But the slow pacing and careful recording lend an opulent scale to the compact spaces, and the pieces work like tiny yet detailed scenes in music boxes, charming and sad.</p>
<p>Throughout the album, a mood of doomed romance prevails. On ""Erla's Waltz"", a stately heartbreaker for solo piano, you can practically see the elegant ceramic figurines turning their tragic steps, and the plangent melody bowed across ""Faun"" seems to be openly weeping. There are few ""difficult"" passages, only limpid revolutions of melody and counterpoint with an overemphasis on climaxes. The album approaches that troublesome quality-- sentimentality-- with earnestness and faith. It's like Arnalds is picking up cues from the emotionally-charged ambient of Eluvium as the latter embarks on a new vocal-centered style.</p>
<p>From music-box melodies to maudlin strings, <i>Found Songs</i> dispenses clichés at an astonishing pace, which makes it seem both under- and overwhelming at first. (How easy is it to admire and then forget pretty albums filled with strings, pianos, and light field recordings?) It seems too stirring in a way that's too easy. But Arnalds' attention to nuance amid all the fanfare, and to tone at every moment, goes a long way toward redeeming those intense emotions we write off as puerile. On ""Romance"", the wearily hopeful, Satie-like piano line sidewinds briefly into a more tentative-sounding key before righting itself again, an unsentimental touch that makes everything around it more piercing.</p>
<p>Slight thematic complications like this hint at a formidable future for Arnalds, once he sheds some youthful excesses. But even when they smother his subtler instincts, his passions have a certain charm, and arrangements that could have been weak tea gain a palpable kick. You feel moved, but not quite used, and <i>Found Songs</i> feels special beyond the means of its borderline wallpaper-y aesthetic.</p></div>"|13808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13808-found-songs/|6.3|Brian Howe

Plenty as it turns out.</p>
<p>Local Natives have already gained a foothold in parts of Europe-- their album has received attention in the UK and they graced the cover of Scandinavia's <i>Sonic</i> magazine late last year-- at home in L.A., and online. With good reason too: Advance singles ""Airplanes"" and ""Sun Hands"" recalled elements of Dodos or the Fleet Foxes. The best comparison perhaps is that they're sort of a West Coast Grizzly Bear-- right down to naming an album after the location in which it was recorded. Yet whereas Grizzly Bear's <i>Yellow House </i>is a cozy, isolated New  England seaside shack, Local Natives' <i>Gorilla Manor </i>is a squalid Orange County party pad.</p>
<p>At first listen that seems off-- the chops and compositional sense here are the most immediately impressive part of the album. But dig deeper and you realize Local Natives never lose sight of the pleasures of being a youthful rock band-- right down to themes of wanderlust and discovery. ""Oh, to see it with my own eyes,"" goes to the central lyrics to album opener ""Wide Eyes"".<span> </span>This inquisitiveness and quest for self-knowledge may as well be the record's life-affirming and open-armed thesis statement.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Indeed, this optimism relishes experience and finds opportunity where others may see obstacles: Garage rocker ""Camera Talk"" initially reads like a harried travelogue (""We're running through the aisles/ Of the churches still in style""), but the
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
band still comes off like they're living the dream-- ""
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
And even though I can't be sure/ Memory tells me that these times are worth working for."" <span> </span>""Airplanes"" is a tribute to one of the bandmember's pilot grandfather, and while the counterpoints of strings and piano are buoyant enough it's the evocative images (chopsticks from his time spent in Japan, a well-thumbed encyclopedia) that indicate his life was well-lived.<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But even where the lyrics get more obtuse (a Skype exchange with an ex is likened to a ""Cubism Dream""), there's almost always a strong pulse running through the busy, precise compositions: ""Shape Shifter"", for example, is about impressionistic themes of self-reckoning but the sentiment is also reflected in the song's arrangement. At certain points, it's <i>Gorilla Manor</i>'s sludgiest track; at others, it's the most quicksilver and agile.<span> </span>The strings and harmonies of the glacial ""Cards &amp; Quarters"" and ""Who Knows, Who Cares?"" are gorgeous, but drum rolls and washes of cymbal hint at imminent collapse.<span> </span>Only closer ""Sticky Thread"" offers calm.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So while the record's second half dials back the tempo, stuck in its midsection is a cover of the Talking Heads, hardly a band that would be considered ""loose.""<span> </span>""Warning Sign"" isn't the most canonical of their songs, but taking it on is an audacious decision for a band that would be wise to let the comparisons come to them first.<span> </span>They retain the elasticity of the bassline and the general verse-chorus structure, but that's about it: David Byrne's pinprick vocals are treated with melodic contour and supple harmonies, the breakdown veers from nervous to joyfully emphatic, and the guitars soften around the edges.<span> </span>Whether it's ""better"" than the original is besides the point-- at least for four minutes, Local Natives take ownership of it, fully integrating what might have been an incompatible hard left turn into the record's seamless whole. True, we tend to bow at novelty and innovation, but <i>Gorilla Manor </i>proves to be a refreshing reminder of the pleasures of synthesis.</p></div>"|13925.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13925-gorilla-manor/|8.4|Ian Cohen

The first member mentioned was keyboardist and co-founder David Boulter. He's one of the architects of the band's sound, and his piano and organ have been signatures of the band for almost 20 years. And in the video he was playing... tambourine. His big moment on camera didn't show him doing what he does best. There is something perversely appropriate about this-- Tindersticks have always made music that thrives on their lack of egos, and here Boulter was just doing what the song asks for.</p>
<p>The track in question is an odd one, opening the band's eighth album (not counting soundtracks), and in terms of vocals it's more of a mantra than a song. There are three lines of lyrics, sung over and over in different combinations by smoky-voiced Stuart Staples and bassist Dan McKinna as the band provides jazzy drumming and wiry guitar figures. Longtime collaborator and satellite band member Terry Edwards plays sputtering trumpet, and the word is that he wasn't allowed to listen to it while playing-- they just told him what it sounded like. That kind of creative process-- encouraging the happy accident-- and the overall dialogue-ish approach to building a song that marks <i>Falling Down a Mountain</i> as an attempt to re-energize the veteran band.</p>
<p>This is their second album since half of the original sextet quit. Its predecessor, 2008's <i>The Hungry Saw</i>, exhibited some of the same tentativeness. They are, in a sense, a new band living in the long shadow of an old one. Their first three albums were difficult masterpieces, their next few strange explorations of soul music, their sixth a summary and a farewell. Albums seven and eight have been relaxed and seemingly unconcerned with besting the old stuff. That's probably for the best, as it lets them crank out the kind of simple pleasures that seem to flow naturally from them. On this album, that's evident on low-volume lullaby ""Keep You Beautiful"", which is like a Willie Mitchell production stripped to its barest, topped by a guy with molasses for vocal chords. Elsewhere, ""Factory Girls"" is a simple but lush piano-led ballad that lets Staples play around in his upper register as he licks romantic wounds and ruminates on aging. It stays sparse until its final minute, when the whole band comes in to lift him up.</p>
<p>McKinna and the other new members, drummer Earl Harvin and guitarist David Kitt, provide Tindersticks with something they've never had before: a backing vocal section that can go call-and-response with Staples. They do it best on ""Black Smoke"", a Velvet Underground-type groove that features plenty of backing harmonies and a crazy sax part that sounds like it wandered off from a Roxy Music session. The Latin-flavored ""She Rode Me Down"" is another standout, pulling the band together into a rhythmic juggernaut. At the complete opposite end of things is ""Peanuts"", a spartan duet between Staples and singer/actress Mary Margaret O'Hara that never gets anywhere-- it's sparse to the point of boring, and next to past duet highlights like ""Travelling Light"" it pales completely.</p>
<p>Especially during its quietest moments, this album is almost more like the memory of a song than the song itself. It leaves a very hazy, almost spectral impression when it ends. But it's also warm and in some ways comforting, and it improves the more you listen to it and tease out the details in the songs. Tindersticks Mk II seems to be hitting its stride and discovering where its real creative chemistry lies.</p></div>"|13849.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13849-falling-down-a-mountain/|7.0|Joe Tangari

In the 1990s, women from Riot Grrrl to PJ Harvey made joyously raw, aggressive, and polemical rock, now a much-missed sound. That is what makes Wetdog-- a British all-woman trio whose sophomore effort celebrates their percussive, atonal foremothers like the Slits, the Raincoats, and LiLiPUT-- sound so fresh despite their obvious influences. After all, the girls at home with their videogame plastic Gibsons need Guitar Heroes, too.</p>
<p>After their 22-track 2008 debut, Wetdog return with the more concise <i>Frauhaus</i>. The new LP blows through its 14 songs in less than half an hour, building its tracks out of sinister, plucky bass rumblings, alternately bored and screechy vocals, and rhythms so geometric that it would be cliché to call them ""angular,"" were that not already the name of the band's British label. The album kicks off with first single ""Lower Leg"", which gets a lot of mileage out of wiry rhythms and an urgently pulsing bassline. Rhythms shift from a syrupy strut to a chaotic double-time, and the strangely disjointed symmetry that holds the first track together acts as connective tissue for the rest of the collection. ""Snapper"" weaves its creepy-carnival polka melody around spaghetti western rhythms, while ""Trehorne Beach Song"" adds a pretty garage-pop shimmy into the mix, and ""Long Long Time to Go"" layers a menacing guitar throb and deadpan harmonies over a steady, militaristic march. There is a powerful yet playful chaos to the way the collection is organized, but that is part of its charm.</p>
<p>One can't help wish, however, that some of the songs were given space to breathe, especially the much-too-short ""Trehorne Beach Song"" and the ethereally harmonized ""Round Vox"". Rather than allowing their tensely con

structed, minimalist melodies to blossom into infectious hooks, often a sloppy verse and a brash chorus is all they can spare in a track's quick, two-minute runtime.</p>
<p>Were we swimming in a sea of likeminded releases, <i>Frauhaus</i> may seem merely competent-- a collection that leaves listeners wishing the trio weren't so slavish in their devotion to early-80s post-punk and no wave, but one that gets the toughly innocent, acidic vibe right nonetheless. But it acts as a welcome torchbearer of smart, female-led punk and, perhaps for its youngest listeners, a much-needed history lesson.</p></div>"|13900.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13900-frauhaus/|6.6|Rebecca Raber

<p class=""MsoNormal"">That album cover up there is misleading: When E.C. Ball faced a frowning world, he did so with a smile. Or at least that's the impression his songs give-- that the stern-voiced singer and songwriter took immense joy in praising the Lord through music. When he wasn't driving a school bus and running a service station in Rugby, Virginia, the folk-gospel artist and his wife Orna traveled around Appalachia, playing churches of all denominations and radio stations of all wattages. Ball was no fire-and-brimstone scold, though, nor did he fashion himself as a God-appointed teacher with special moral authority. Instead, he remained humble, content, and hopeful, writing simple songs with simple messages. Even at his darkest, his songs celebrate faith: ""Lord, I want more religion,"" he sings on one of his most famous compositions. ""Religion makes me happy.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Not that every song is upbeat, but Ball preached salvation more than damnation. By and large, the artists on <i>Face a Frowning World</i>, which declares itself <span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span><span> </span></span></span>a ""memorial album"" rather than a tribute (I'm guessing for reasons of Christian humility), revere this aspect of Ball's music, and in covering his songs, they also consider his faith-- whether they share it or not. Dave Bird testifies proudly on ""He's My God"", and Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy extols the stalwartness of ""John the Baptist"" before keening ostentatiously over Catherine Irwin's earthy vocals on ""Beautiful Star of Bethlehem"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">By contrast, Rayna Gellert's soft-spoken ""Lord, I Want More Religion"" is a ruminative, plainspoken prayer, a subdued take that suggests a one-on-one with the Big Man Himself. Even on ""Tribulations"", sung here by Joe Manning and Glen Dentinger, Ball's depiction of the apocalypse contrasts dramatically with the promise of rescue and reward: ""When the fire come down from heaven and the blood shall fill the sea, I'll be carried home by Jesus and forever with him be."" The two Louisville musicians sing those lines steadfastly, with a content resignation bolstered by the band's spare arrangement.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Face a Frowning World </i>has the feel of a jubilee, as Louisville's Health &amp; Happiness Family Gospel Band back a range of Ball fans and followers with the enthusiasm of a Sunday morning pick-up band. On the whole, they keep things loose and lively, although at times their energy gets the better of them: They liven up Jon Langford's ""When I Get Home I'm Gonna Be Satisfied"", but while the spirit is willing, their cover is too loud, too lusty, too worldly. Not that Ball was strictly a religious singer. In fact, he and his wife had a sprawling repertoire that included secular songs, and <i>Face a Frowning World</i> strains to make room for a few of them. Michael Hurley smocks through ""The Early Bird Always Gets the Worm"" as if he wrote it himself, and Pokey LaFarge turns ""Poor Old Country Lad"" into a jumpin' C&amp;W romp. On the other hand, the Handsome Family inexplicably transform the playful children's rhyme ""Jenny Jenkins"" into a slow, dour duet that sucks all the fun out of the song's jumble of syllables. They turn Ball's smile upside down.</p>

With long hair and a penchant for wearing Weezer tees, his look is straight out of 1990s alt America. Which fits, since A Grave With No Name (ostensibly a solo bedroom-pop project but now fleshed out as a three-piece) features many of the hallmarks of 90s guitar indie from this side of the pond-- Pavement slop, the crackle and fuzz of GBV, and so on. But Shields isn't a revisionist, more a mixed-genre collagist, and the other sounds he incorporates are decidedly of the moment-- lo-fi haze, hypnagogic pop pastiche, and gurgly aquatic sound effects are all part of his approach. In fact, if you wanted a time capsule of what a good chunk of 2009 and early 2010 sounded like, <i>Mountain Debris</i> could be it.</p>
<p>That might sound like a dig, but it's not. Shields is part of a crowded pack of artists working in this style-- think also Atlas Sound and Banjo or Freakout-- but his take is punchier than the others, yet still heavy on mood and atmosphere. With material thus far scattered on limited-run releases (a self-titled EP arrived last summer), <i>Mountain Debris</i> collects that earlier work alongside some newer tracks and functions as a handy guide on what the band does well and where it could stand to improve.</p>
<p>The album works its way through a variety of song types in short bursts and hangs together in part because it doesn't linger in one spot for too long. (At 16 tracks, it's still just a little over a half an hour long.) The standard vibe here is a spooky, overcast take on melodic guitar jangle, like C86 stranded out in the woods at night, but Shields and co. take plenty of detours to keep things interesting. Often the best stuff is the simplest, like the warm, encrusted melodies of ""Sofia"", which serves as a good example of how lo-fi production can be not just a textural effect but a way to add depth and intrigue to a song. (This is important, lo-fi upstarts!) There's a clear sense of loss and longing in this track, and that runs throughout the record-- most conspicuous on grainy shoegaze exercises like
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
""Lavender"" and ""Silver"".</p>
<p><i>Mountain Debris</i> can feel scattered, quickly jumping from one idea to the next, yet that doesn't pose a problem until the final stretch. Through ""Horses"", this restless quality actually helps keep your attention. At that point and after, though, you get the sense that the band has run out of ideas and the album starts to stumble. ""Horses"" is shout-y and atonal, not particularly appealing, and the tracks that follow each have a similar fatal flaw: ""Fire Island"" is weirdly kind of proto-grunge meets mumbly lo-fi, ""Chimes"" is too wispy for its own good, and so forth. This stutter to a halt isn't an ideal way to end a record, but it's not quite enough to derail the strong moments that come before it. Mostly <i>Mountain Debris</i> is an encouraging listen, a solid introduction to a band that I'm sure we'll hear more from.</p></div>"|13926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13926-mountain-debris/|6.6|Joe Colly

(And, yes, <a href=""http://www.sade.com/us/biography/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sade are a band</a>.) In the mid-1980s, before hip-hop and R&amp;B became inexplicably twinned, the band helped to define the quiet storm era, when smooth grooves aimed at grown-ups were still a legitimate mainstream phenomenon. In 2010, Sade seems wholly unique.</p>
<p>Music this tasteful and even-keeled can be wearying in large doses, and when the radio was chock full of impossibly slick Vandross-alikes, it was easy to take Sade for granted. But the new <i>Soldier of Love</i> feels soothing after a few hours spent in the company of Ke$ha and Lady Gaga. <i>Soldier of Love</i> offers listeners a rather narrow range of interest-- songs that (at their best) suggest strong feeling restrained by a fierce dignity-- but Sade remain the best at what they do.</p>
<p>And so <i>Soldier of Love</i> is unsurprisingly of a piece with the five previous Sade albums. Songwriting-wise, it could have been released at any point in the band's career. The production only occasionally draws attention to itself-- the dub-esque snare crashes on ""Babyfather"" are a bit of a surprise-- and you can forget any gauche stabs at currently hip sonic tricks. The idea of singer Sade Adu robo-warbling through Auto-Tune would be laughable if it weren't impossible even to conceive. Even the album's curveball first single, title track ""Soldier of Love"", with its strident marching band snare rolls, doesn't so much deviate from Sade's core sound as cast it in a new light: What better to emphasize Adu's sense of control than a rhythm with the stiffly regimented forward momentum of a parade ground drill? And if ""Soldier of Love"" seems ""hard,"" it's only because the surrounding tunes are once again delicate to the point where nuance is all.</p>
<p>The music often gets the short shrift when discussing Sade, because the band is so purposefully unobtrusive. Theirs isn't the kind of minimalism designed to draw attention to itself, merely to capture a mood (usually longing or the gentlest of joy) in as few moves as possible. It's a tricky thing to praise, the kind of competency that's always just a few steps from blandness. Musically, <i>Soldier of Love</i> has plenty of deft touches, like the way ""Morning Bird"" suggests desolation with a piano motif paired back to as few notes as possible. The band knows its job is to provide as unfussy a backdrop for its singer as possible.</p>
<p>And Adu is one of the odder candidates for modern soul-singer canonization. While she's got one of the warmest tones in modern pop, she'll never, ever lose herself in the moment, let her voice run wild. She always seems to be pulling her emotional punches. So if your interest in modern R&amp;B is limited to dance music-- that lineage that runs from new jack swing through Timbaland and beyond-- you may be surprised to learn that the heartbeat-steady ""Skin"" is what Sade calls ecstasy. But Adu's voice has to be one of the most <i>calming</i> sounds on planet Earth. Not for everyone, or every mood, but perfect for working out the kinks caused by pop's mile-a-minute barrage of capital-p Pleasure.</p>
<p>That unwavering sense of understatement has also left Sade strangely underrated, especially by listeners who get antsy when an act makes a virtue of restraint. For decades, pop fans have been mistaking reserve for repression, and composure for lack of soul. In 2010, though, things seem to be changing, at least a little. Describing something as ""smooth"" no longer sets off the same alarms for younger listeners, or younger critics. And Sade's <i>Soldier of Love</i> is kind of a litmus test in that regard. Sade hasn't changed, and <i>Soldier of Love</i> will likely be the year's most <i>relaxing</i> album. But will listeners reared to expect the immediate gratification of rock or rap go for music that hovers tremulously on the edge of both pleasure and pain?</p></div>"|13920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13920-soldier-of-love/|7.0|Jess Harvell

With its nihilism and necromancy, its demons and doom, heavy metal-- especially this strain-- is most often tagged for its dark, grim obsessions, not its celebration. Liturgy, at a glance, might not seem much different: Frontman Hunter Hunt-Hendrix writes about meaninglessness, disaster, and apocalypse in terse, declarative terms, and the band's guitar waves and drum cascades sometimes suggest suffocation.</p>
<p>But crank <i>Renihilation</i> again, and notice the way Greg Fox rebuilds his beats when the band relents-- how hard he slaps those cymbals, how he slowly fills the spaces in his own meter, especially during the backend of ""Pagan Dawn"". Or listen to the intensity of ""Arctica""-- the triumphant guitar introduction, the thunderous way the drums roll into it, the sudden stops and stronger restarts. It feels, conveniently enough, ecstatic, the sound of four ""Brooklyn hipsters"" (as some super kvlt Internet analysts have derided) who go by their given names, wear street clothes, and avoid corpse paint treating extreme metal with the élan of a ripe young garage rock band or a focused noise artist. However harsh the words and however heavy the music, Liturgy have fun with their chosen form-- playing ferociously, writing imaginatively, and, in the process, making a record that reveres black metal's legacy while, at its best, pushes it forward.</p>
<p>For, you know, Brooklyn hipsters, the quartet supplies convincing power and precision. They play hard, fast, and with stamina, storming through these seven three-to-five-minute tracks and using only four interludes (always some combination of guitars, electronics and overtone singing) for rest. But it's not all bustle and blaze. There's lot of space in these tracks, so that even the most tumultuous tunes offer surprising detours.</p>
<p>That's actually where Liturgy are the most compositionally interesting. On ""Mysterium"", for instance, Fox overruns his own frenetic clip, drumming so quickly that all he can do is start and stop again. Each time this happens, Liturgy pause on sharp, dissonant notes, maintaining a pins-and-needles suspense rather than resolving the drama. Liturgy cites minimalist composers La Monte Young and Glenn Branca and Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan as influences. The record's interludes are obvious homages to those outsiders, but so are these moments, when Liturgy reinforce the tension with choices that run counter to rock'n'roll impulses. The possibilities are infinite and largely unexplored.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of <i>Renihilation</i>'s most appealing aspects is what isn't here: From the dissonant guitar shards anchoring the pauses on ""Arctica"" to the mix of chants and electronics serving as interludes between tracks, Liturgy deliver a stream of ideas that seem like strands for continued exploration and synthesis. It's a captivating listen in its own right, but mostly <i>Renihilation</i> establishes the band's bona fides. Yeah, maybe they're art kids or the sons of classical music critics, but Fox destroys on the drums, and Hunt-Hendrix suffers for his words when he howls. He and Bernard Gann comprise an interesting guitar pair, too, as comfortable marching along the same serrated path as they are spiraling around each other in riffs and counters. Bassist Tyler Dusenbury mostly stays out of the way. <i>Renihilation</i> suggests that Liturgy are more certain of possibilities than, at this point, their ability to achieve them. That is, despite a frontman who roars, ""being shall become the eternal return of fire,"" during a song in which he depicts the modern world crumbling in a natural blaze, the aggressive ecstasy of <i>Renihilation</i> promises an exciting future-- for Liturgy, and for us.</p></div>"|13915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13915-renihilation/|7.8|Grayson Currin

Flying Lotus isn't really dubstep, and Rustie isn't quite hip-hop, but they're both wonky-- which, as Martin Clark <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/grime-dubstep/6840-grime-dubstep/"" target=""_blank"">observed a couple of years back</a>, initially emerged as more of a theme than a genre. That theme unites so many veins of inspiration that a closer look at the sound reveals things either uniquely specific (Glasgow's ""aquacrunk"" scene) or so descriptively wide-- Philadelphia's Starkey calls his music ""street bass""-- that they're no more helpful. So wonky is one of those know-it-when-you-hear-it things, a digital pulse of unstable time signatures that aims to unite the sonic commonalities between hip-hop, dubstep, electro, UK funky, IDM, and any other potential source of those synthesized basslines' shared DNA.</p>
<p>Gathering them all up into one place for an attempted overview is the kind of project that risks becoming both illuminating and confusing. <i>North/South/East/West</i> was originally meant to be a collaborative art/music project between photographer Shaun Bloodworth and designer Stuart Hammersley, who initially intended to highlight a few artists from the London dubstep world for Warp subsidiary <a href=""http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=22523"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bleep.com</a>. It was after they took a similar project to Los Angeles' beat-music underground that they decided to tie the two scenes together, and throw in two others-- Glasgow and New York-- to complete a sort of four-corners wonky overview. The final product mostly adheres to a certain intangible sense of style without actually sounding like its artists are all following the same route.</p>
<p>The UK's North/South axis of the collection shares the most common musical background; most of these artists can trace a direct lineage to UK garage, whether it's through grime, dubstep, or UK funky. The London and Bristol artists that were the project's initial focus include two early catalysts of post-garage dance niches, with dubstep innovator Skream providing the brooding, kick-heavy throb of ""Slumfunk"" and UK funky curator Geeneus contributing the vintage Detroit inflections of ""Ultrafunkula"".</p>
<p>Their commonalities are in the fine details (foamy low-end; a certain glowing cast to the synth sounds) rather than the bigger rhythmic picture, which is why Headhunter's ""Collecting Butterflies""-- combining uptempo, borderline-rave synth and snare with a growling mid-tempo bassline-- is a good selection to tie the two together. Glasgow, meanwhile, is represented by the aforementioned ""aquacrunk"" variant popularized by Rustie, whose ""Bad Science"" takes Southern-bounce to a hyperactive extreme. Given the other two slices of the Glasgow scene on display-- the night-ending dubstep swoon of Taz Buckfaster's elegaic ""Au Revoir"", and Hudson Mohawke's handclap-driven, cathedral-sized ""FUSE"", the most anthemic track on the comp-- it's the closest there is to an easy stylistic convergence.</p>
<p>Things get more spread out and fractured where the American coasts are concerned, and the only real commonality that the New York and L.A. artists hold is a general sense that they owe a bit more to left-field breakbeat and jazz. The musicians that represent NYC here find a lot of elbow room in that particular area, even as they all have the same tendency to cultivate similar post-hip-hop atmosphere. Kotchy's ""You Know You"" extrapolates a strange sort of mournful soul-jazz out of a boom-bap rhythm and lets it flutter in and out of space, switching up between cocktail-bar piano and distorted 80s funk synthesizers to disorienting effect. Mike Slott's ""When Giants Meet"" is an escalating series of sharp detours-- truncated riffs, quick blasts of notes, melodies that travel in and out of frame-- over a fidgety drumbeat. Next to those two, FaltyDL's mid-tempo acid-jazz electric piano meditation ""Some Day My Queen Will Come"" sounds like an outtake from a mid-90s Mo Wax comp.</p>
<p>Ironically, even though Bloodworth and Hammersley's visit to L.A. sparked the multi-city nature of <i>North/South/East/West</i>, that scene feels like the most loosely represented. Nothing really unites the two Flying Lotus tracks (the brief but impactful demi-Asian g-funk of <i>L.A. EP </i>cut ""Rickshaw"" and Matthew David's soupy, beatless ambient reworking of ""Comet Course"") with the quirky, baroque contribution by Daedelus (""A Bloodworth""). And given how sprawling and creatively active the Brainfeeder collective is-- it's the same scene that gave us next-level beat futurists like Nosaj Thing, the Gaslamp Killer, and Ras_G-- the West-representing side of this comp feels like surface-scraping in comparison.</p>
<p>As a collection of tracks, <i>North/South/East/West</i> is a solid effort with plenty of highlights, and even with the stylistic divergence it doesn't throw listeners off too much, opting to sequence for mood rather than regional affinity. As an art project, it certainly looks nice-- the photographs and visual design of the limited-edition package rope together an evocative visual aesthetic that complements the music's mood of darkness without bleakness. (The limited-edition CD is a fancy-packaged art piece; more casual listeners will likely settle for the digital download, which includes individual artwork with each music file.) And as a summary of a multi-fronted hydra of a scene, it does as well as can be expected-- whether it's a genre or just a theme, the fact that it can be alluring in so many different ways, none of which have been mined to the point of cliché, should be enough to forgive the sprawl.</p></div>"|13904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13904-northsoutheastwest/|7.4|Nate Patrin

In the quickest, dirtiest sense, the Amazing trade Dungen singer and sole songwriter Gustav Ejstes for former Granada frontman Christoffer Gunrup, and where Ejstes sings entirely in Swedish, Gunrup opts for English. The two men don't share all of the same influences (though they do share some), and that's where the groups diverge, because if there's one thing Ejstes and Gunrup have in common, it's a keen faithfulness to their particular sources of inspiration. The Amazing's reference points aren't nearly as broad as Dungen's, but each project succeeds by reproducing vintage sounds so lovingly and masterfully that a lack of originality ceases to matter.</p>
<p>Most people first caught wind of the Amazing late last year via the wonderfully lissome single ""Dragon"", the majority of which is given over to misty, moody acoustic folk rumination in the vein of Nick Drake. Almost half of the album explicitly mines this same terrain. The achingly sensitive, fingerpicked fragilities ""Beach House"", ""Is It Likely"", and ""The Strangest Thing"" may skirt the line that keeps out soggily simplistic pushovers like Damien Rice and David Gray, but Gunrup's alluring lyrics and the sheer loveliness of the instrumentation ensure they stay on the non-douchey side of the divide.</p>
<p>The element of ""Dragon"" that leaps out on first listen is its beautifully fluid twin-guitar refrain that evokes the easy-bake grooves of the Allman Brothers Band and the Grateful Dead. This sun-dappled style crops up again at various points on the album, and, in a more general sense, the parts of the record that don't find Gunrup conjuring up Drake's pink moons and northern skies instead see the band exploring various permutations of stoner-friendly rock. Opener ""The Kirwan Song"" features a sublime interpolation of Fleetwood Mac's ""Sunny Side of Heaven"", penned by the eponymous Danny Kirwan and recorded just as the Mac were transitioning from jam-friendly blues-rock to soft-focus pop. Fittingly, Gunrup and co. take Kirwan's original, intimate instrumental and blow it up to stadium size, complete with thunderous drum rolls from Dungen kitmaster Johan Holmegard. That's just a warm-up for the massive, molten ""Code II"", a roiling monolith of wicked, doomy guitar shards and more skull-rattling drumming.</p>
<p>The hazy, heavily treated ""Dead"" could pass for mid-period Flaming Lips, but it's on the penultimate ""Had to Keep Walking"" that the Amazing really kick into interstellar overdrive. As the song cycles through a cerebral, ruminative groove, it touches on post-rock before melting into a keyboard-laden head trip ripped straight from the Tangerine Dream and Pink Floyd playbooks. As far-flung as Dungen may be, they're clearly not going to be able to exhaust every avenue of album-era revivalism all by themselves.</p></div>"|13882.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13882-the-amazing/|7.3|Joshua Love

One of a spate of late-2009 electronic records to get caught up in the end-of-year wash (see also: Redshape's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13802-the-dance-paradox/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Dance Paradox</i></a>), <i>Playtime</i> caps an impressive year for Germany's Workshop label with a no-seams mix of gliding house music and ambient composition. This is Moufang's second fruitful collaboration in as many years-- 2008's Benjamin Brunn collaboration, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12539-songs-from-the-beehive/"" target=""_blank"">Songs From the Beehive</a><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, </span></i>offered bright, brainy techno-- and it's logical to ascribe most of <i>Playtime</i>'s success to him (Sharp has been mostly silent since the mid-1990s).</p>
<p>Although the duo met at an Autechre show, drawing connections to that band is a red herring: <i>Playtime</i> sits lightly and never intentionally perturbs. Its 80 minutes race by as the duo balances dense, low-tension keyboard epics with graceful, urban-gray mood pieces. The record opens with ""Dinner With Q"", a playful disco thrum that features a classic juking bassline and splashes of guitar. Over the course of 13 minutes, Moufang stretches his legs into spacey arpeggios and a beatless, acoustic interlude as the track careens toward the sort of athletic house music that appeared on his mid-90s classic <i>Kunststoff</i>.</p>
<p>The comparatively short ""Shibuya Day"" cools the heat that ""Dinner With Q"" and the lounge-y ""DJ Friendly"" generate, drifting lightly until a careful beat inches in. ""Confidence"" earns its name; ""Keep Building"" is traditionally polemic house music, with Black Jazz Consortium's Fred P providing husky mantras that never get too pushy (""You just gotta keep moving forward... one step at a time""). ""Freerotation"" is perhaps the album's one misfire, five minutes of echoing patter that mainly serves as an intro for <i>Playtime</i>'s behemoth closer. Swallowing the album's final 24 minutes, ""Du Bist Hier!"" (""You Are Here!"") never seems its length as its heartbeat rhythm trolls through decaying keyboards.</p>
<p>It isn't novelty that carries <i>Playtime</i>-- plenty of ""deep house"" toes the line between ambient and dance music-- but rather  execution. After a decade of mostly lauded house production, Moufang has spent the last two years choosing collaborators to help him stretch his melodies until they're soft and threadbare. <i>Playtime</i> is comfortable and lived-in, a veteran's work than never tires or lapses into old habits.</p></div>"|13902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13902-playtime/|7.3|Andrew Gaerig

They carried an air of mystery and surprise, and at their best (""2080"", ""Sunrise"") managed to make offbeat mysticism and off-kilter pop music seem attractive and exciting. They were basically a rootsy, classic rock-ish version of MGMT then. Their fate seemed doubly sealed by ""Tightrope"", their laser-focused and damn near best-in-show contribution to the all-star charity compilation <i>Dark Was the Night</i>.</p>
<p>Then they arguably topped that with ""Ambling Alp"", the pre-release single to sophomore album <i>Odd Blood</i>. ""Alp"" managed to retain the leftfield bona fides within an easy-to-love glassy pop sheen. That duality extended to the lyrics as well: The song is about infamous Italian boxer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primo_Carnera"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Primo Carnera</a>, but in the chorus Chris Keating sang the kind of wholesome fatherly advice you might hear in a <i>Shrek</i> montage.</p>
<p>Like ""Ambling Alp"", <i>Odd Blood</i> itself should appeal to a lot of people: Yeasayer have made a  potentially vanguard record using the full range of possibilities of software-based music to create what once would have been radio-friendly rock. The elastic ""O.N.E."" and the Tears for Fears-ish ""I Remember"" are successful mid-80s throwbacks, achieving the full potential hinted at on <i>All Hour Cymbals</i> and rivaling that album's best material. Opener ""The Children"" also works by tailoring their offbeat tendencies into a tightly packaged song. In much of the first half of the album, Yeasayer demonstrate a rare craftsmanship and consideration that's too often shoved under the rug in modern indie music. Their lyrics may not say much of anything, but their agile arrangements, sense of dynamics and pacing, and singer Chris Keating's expressive vocals communicate plenty.</p>
<p>The rest of the album suffers from a major identity crisis-- few of the various far-flung ideas it explores pan out, and most of them wind up overcooked. On the whole, the record alternates between a prog-rock version of 80s UK synth-pop  (and those are the good songs) and dreadlocky alt-pop or yuppie-era world music imitations (aaaand... those are  the bad ones). Songs like ""Rome"" or ""Love Me Girl"" aim for ambitious sprawl but just wind up muddy, while the ballads ""Strange Reunions"" and ""Grizelda"" seem plodding and congested. The more in need of editing the music gets, the weaker the lyrics become: ""Mondegreen"" is the worst offender, with Keating chanting ""Everybody's talking about me and my baby makin' love 'til the morning light"" ad nauseum over shamanistic electro-boogie. (But you knew that-- I mean, <i>everybody's talking about it.</i>)</p>
<p>Of course, Yeasayer aren't going anywhere: quality singles, inventive videos, and solid live performances go far. But it's hard to miss the pressure the band was under to deliver here-- it's nearly palpable in their overfed production and search for direction, and as a result, <i>Odd Blood</i> is a bit too much of not enough. I went back and  listened to ""Tightrope"" again. It remains charming, human, and assured, winning your affection instead of trying to earn your respect. When <i>Odd  Blood</i> succeeds, it does the same, but when it fails,  it fails badly.</p></div>"|13922.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13922-odd-blood/|6.1|Scott Plagenhoef

Judging from the surplus of overdriven machine noise in which their hippie-folk tunes are mired, you'd think the trees in Pittsburgh came equipped with electrical outlets. They insist on texture over definition, and as a consequence, their albums invariably sound warm, inviting, and homogenous.</p>
<p>With <i>Periphery</i>, the third solo release by a member of the band (Maux Boyle), you begin to suspect that the tendency to favor timbre over songwriting is a function of the band's dynamic, and not the inclination of the individual members. Tobacco's <i>Fucked Up Friends</i>, a largely instrumental hip-hop record released on Anticon, retained BMSR's shaggy atmosphere, but drew it into focus with spirited beats. As the Seven Fields of Aphelion, Boyle strikes a similar bargain between her main group's fetish for analog unpredictability and a more precise method of composition. Working with synthesizer and lightly treated piano, she has produced an album of more comprehensible sounds, which seems plainly indebted to certain Eno collaborations-- with Harold Budd, on the piano-led numbers, and with Robert Fripp on the synth-led ones. There is, however, some pussyfooting.</p>
<p>The sounds here are almost too comprehensible, and at times, deployed too tentatively. Music that treads the ambient/new age line can't stint on mystery, and these tracks, while always very pretty, can feel too obvious to draw us below the surface. On ""Slow Subtraction"", we hear some reversed synth hums and delayed piano keys-- there's never a ""Wow, what am I hearing?"" moment. A big challenge for this kind of music is to make soothing sounds we've heard many times interesting. Across this album, mostly stock tricks are deployed: chimes and drones on ""Pale Prophecy"", detuned wobbles on ""Cloud Forest (The Little Owl)"", gradually encroaching static on ""Saturation: Arrhythmia"". These effects feel moderately effective yet entirely familiar.</p>
<p>Even though the building blocks are well-known, Boyle often manages to animate them persuasively and creatively. The bass that sweeps through ""Slow Subtraction"" has a grand upward shift, and ""Grown"" gets exciting when spacey synthesizers come corkscrewing out of the piano line. In fact, the record is almost always more attractive when Boyle lets her synths do more than sculpt the background, like on ""Mountain Mary"" and ""Michigan Icarus"", where they disrupt the linear slog with a sense of height and freedom. <i>Periphery </i>has all the right moves in place to deliver a pleasurable experience, and it delivers one: I'll certainly break this album out once in awhile. But it's missing an intangible quality-- the depth of Budd/Eno's <i>The Pearl</i>, or the force of Fripp/Eno's <i>Evening Star</i>-- that makes the best ambient music outstrip its scanty means.</p></div>"|13886.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13886-periphery/|5.8|Brian Howe

It is tied in with astrology, and in those terms, it's basically a humbling process that spurs the introspection and self-evaluation necessary for transformative growth. With that in mind, the title of Scout Niblett's sixth album is rather appropriate. She truly sounds like a woman willing to suffer through anything, to burn away what doesn't work, in order to gain strength and wisdom. Her music has always been lonely, introverted, and anguished, but the stakes seem much higher on this album, like it's a do-or-die scenario. To some extent, listening to <i>The Calcination of Scout Niblett</i> is more like bearing witness to a ritual. Even if the music is often arresting and engaging, it's not for us so much as something Niblett obviously needs to do for herself. This is a very uncompromising work of art, to say the least.</p>
<p>Scout Niblett is a woman who takes astrology and alchemy very seriously, and over the course of her career, these themes have become central to her songwriting. I realize that may sound kinda crackpot and off-putting, but it's important to note that you really don't need to be as invested as she is in those ideas to get something out of this music. This isn't dense, overly mystical nonsense. Niblett draws on these archetypes and iconography for their metaphorical value, and she consistently places the emphasis in the songs on anticipation and catharsis. Her compositions typically alternate between a heavily distorted thud and brittle, minimal passages that serve as lulls. Percussion comes and goes, and some of the loudest moments are without the clatter of drums, resulting in an eerie, hollow noise.</p>
<p>On a surface level, this music can resemble PJ Harvey on <i>Rid of Me</i> or Nirvana on <i>In Utero</i>, both of which were also engineered by Niblett's collaborator Steve Albini. The substance is closer to Cat Power's <i>Moon Pix</i> and the early albums by the reclusive songwriter Jandek. Like them, Niblett has a way of making you hang on her every note, and making her guitar strings sound like some kind of fragile tether to sanity. Her voice is expressive and raw, shifting between wounded soulfulness and unhinged fury. Her songs are not uninviting, and tracks like ""I.B.D."" and ""Duke of Anxiety"" have strong, memorable melodic hooks, but the starkness and intensity of it all makes for a very difficult and challenging record. However, on the occasions when the music connects, it is mesmerizing and uncanny whether you are directly relating to her or having a more voyeuristic experience.</p>
<p>The extreme intimacy implied by the recording is both fascinating and uncomfortable, but that isn't necessarily a complaint. This is an excellent document and a successful expression of something that is clearly personal to the artist. Our comfort level and patience is beside the point, but not unimportant. Niblett's music is very much an acquired taste, and there are few ways to enjoy this other than on her terms. She's not oblivious to this, and she has a sense of humor about it. The black and white photograph on the cover is a sly, on-the-nose bit of dark comedy: She's standing there waving and smiling at us as she holds up a welding torch, presumably about to set herself on fire. It's her odd little way of welcoming an audience to what she describes on the title track as her ""self-made sweat box."" It's grim and indulgent, but not lacking in style and wit.</p></div>"|13916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13916-the-calcination-of-scout-niblett/|7.3|Matthew Perpetua

His first track, ""Sequence 10"", was featured on Virgin's seminal <i>Techno: The New Dance Sound of Detroit</i> in 1988. You can draw short, uninterrupted lines between Shakir and any of the first- (Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May) or second-wave (Underground Resistance, Carl Craig) Detroit techno acts. Yet his hometown, chosen genre, and general demeanor-- much of Shakir's work has come out on his own Frictional label; he refused to promote his work in European markets, although they embraced many of his contemporaries-- have boxed Shakir into obscurity. <i>Frictionalism 1994-2009</i>, a 3xCD, 35-track retrospective on Rush Hour Recordings (an abbreviated, 4x12"" vinyl set of the same name appeared late last year), places many of Shakir's records on CD for the first time and sheds light on one of Detroit techno's great, unclaimed dance artists.</p>
<p>At his best, Shakir is a hypnotic producer, spools of psychedelic noise whipping off his tightly coiled beats. A noted pop fan-- he's notoriously unafraid of playing pop music in his DJ sets, and he once sampled the B-52's-- the tracks on <i>Frictionalism</i> rarely betray their samples, yet they also avoid slipping into noise or ambience. Tracks could function on the floor, but they don't always feel as if they were constructed for that purpose. This is fitting. In interviews Shakir comes off as an introspective ball of contradictions; it is difficult to imagine him attending many club nights. Within a group of musicians already notoriously peeved about a lack of respect, Shakir seems particularly upset, referring to himself as the ""invisible man of techno."" But Shakir is also self-deprecating and aware: He frequently referred to himself as the janitor of Juan Atkins' Metroplex Records; he now admits that much of his invisibility is his own doing.</p>
<p><i>Frictionalism</i> is spry and elegant throughout, notable from a scene whose progenitors were both establishing a new genre and learning to use their instruments. ""Stereotype""'s slowly gathering strings and ""Arise""'s alien synthesizers sound deluxe and deeply musical. ""Roaming"" contains a bobbing jazz bassline; ""Simpatico"" is a keyboard-helmed house jam that is modest and self-contained. <i>Frictionalism</i> spreads out over three and a half hours but it contains few anthems and fewer indulgences, Shakir preferring instead to provide to just lay in the grooves of his regenerating hop.</p>
<p>Shakir is known for incorporating hip-hop into his productions, and while the vast majority of <i>Frictionalism</i> exists on the techno axis, it'd be easy to see J Dilla latch onto the symphonic jazz of ""Detroit State of Mind"" or Madlib onto the smoky Eastern funk of the spectacularly titled ""Things Come and Go"". Influence is a strange concept with an artist like Shakir, though. He produced formative work during a formative period, but his records have long been out of print, and ascribing any real guidance to his work requires a lot of faith in the record collections of his offspring. Did Kieran Hebden ever run across the Four Tet-y ""Tracks for My Father"" 12""? Does it matter if he didn't?</p>
<p>Shakir is at a crossroads. Earlier this decade he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis; he attributed a years-long recording layoff to purchasing the wrong recording software for his laptop. But last year's <i>Levitate Venice</i> EP was received with reverence and acclaim; <i>Frictionalism</i> makes his work available in a way it has never been (Shakir chose Rush Hour specifically for their European distribution capabilities). Shakir fondly compares techno producers with jazz musicians for their ability to extend their creative lives. <i>Frictionalism</i> gives him the opportunity to continue in front of an audience, but it also exposes an already rewarding creative life that deserves more company.</p></div>"|13914.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13914-frictionalism-1994-2009/|8.3|Andrew Gaerig

Cosloy had no designs on this being the definitive document of the Austin music scene, and <a href=""http://www.avclub.com/austin/articles/matador-records-gerard-cosloy-builds-his-casual-vi,36656/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he'll eagerly cop to that</a>.  The ways and means might have changed, but the impulses that inspired Cosloy to throw together <i>Casual Victim Pile</i> are the same impulses behind <i>Bands That Could Be God</i>, a compilation of Boston-area bands he co-released in 1984: an unabashed love of music, and an interest in getting that music heard.</p>
<p>If this compilation is making any sort of definitive statement, it's Cosloy's influence on the Amerindie underground over the past 20-plus years.  Aside from a couple of tracks (most notably the Distant Seconds' ""Akron Bureau"", a decent enough tune that is nevertheless a little too fond of Spoon), most of <i>Pile</i> sounds like  music that could've been found on a Homestead Records compilation circa 1987.  Even the compilation's anagramatic title-- its built around Austin's nickname, ""live music capital""-- has a certain punk-just-died terseness and clarity to it.  Yet the music on <i>Pile</i> doesn't sound stodgy or dated; it's instead a testament to the continued creative viability of that nebulous yet unmistakable classic indie rock sound. As Cosloy notes in the AV Club interview linked above, there's plenty of aesthetic wiggle room between bands on this album.  But while the Wipers-esque tremors of Dikes of Holland's ""Little City Girl"" doesn't share much in common sonically with the pure hardcore of the Teeners' ""Nazis on Film"", the bassy reverb of the Young's ""Blister"", or charming, shambling twerpiness of Harlem's ""Beautiful and Very Smart"", their engines are all fueled by a similar fire.</p>
<p>The quality of <i>Pile</i> rarely wavers, though front-to-back listeners will encounter brief stretches of catchy straightforward punk or punk-like tunes that might encourage some skipping.  Those with a hankering for some cavernous swampy post-punk can cue up ELVIS' ""Mommy's Little Soldiers"" or the appropriately titled ""Spirits Roam"" by Woven Bones.  With ""The Engineer"", Tre Orsi offers something akin to a kinder, gentler Unwound, while Wild America rocks out in a feeling-Minnesota (by way of Buffalo Tom) fashion.  There are plenty of guitar-rock wrinkles to be found all over this comp, but if you're looking for the best <i>Pile</i> has to offer, the album graciously gives listeners that right at the start.  Follow That Bird!'s ""The Ghosts That Wake You"" is a propulsive and wiry tune that's agile enough to shift gears gracefully and has its shows of musical force ably abetted by Lauren Green's unfettered belting.  It makes the sort of first impression that quickly leads to a second and third one, and hopefully <a href=""http://www.avclub.com/austin/articles/matador-records-gerard-cosloy-builds-his-casual-vi,36656/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a quick web search</a> to purchase some of the group's offerings.  That said, if you simply stop with this lead-off track without exploring <i>Casual Victim Pile</i> further, you're doing yourself, and this compilation, a grave disservice.</p></div>"|13919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13919-casual-victim-pile/|7.5|David Raposa

As a spoken-word artist and poet, he could pinpoint the fissures in the American dream and exorcise them with a wit that blended righteous anger and arch sarcasm. As a singer he could envelop those same uncomfortable confrontations in a rich, emotional tone that brought out the empathetic face of unrest. Yet except for a chorus cameo on Blackalicious' ""First in Flight"" and a memorable shout-out on LCD Soundsystem's ""Losing My Edge"", he was rarely heard or cited in the early years of America's great post-traumatic decade, even if his pained depiction of ""a nation that just can't stand much more"" in ""Winter in America"" rang as true in 2002 as it did in 1975.</p>
<p>Instead, Scott-Heron spent much of the 00s in and out of prison on drug charges, adding onto a long hiatus that saw him turn away from the record industry in favor of live performance and writing. Between 1983 and 2009, he released only one studio album, 1994's <i>Spirits</i>, so issuing his first in 16 years could've been rife with potential for a pent-up analysis of everything that's happened in the process of race relations and American culture over the last couple decades. Yet <i>I'm New Here </i>sees an incisive political voice turning inwards, not protesting the doings of the greater world but crafting a frank confessional over the state of his own. He does this allusively, through cover songs and short soundbite interludes and original compositions that feel like sparse flashes of a deep, once-dormant creative impulse. Yet it still feels honest, like something said out of necessity instead of opportunity, and the result is an album that engages with the idea of loneliness in exceptional ways.</p>
<p><i>I'm New Here </i>is bookended with a two-part spoken-word track that sounds like a metatextual stunt: the quintessential hip-hop prototype discussing his upbringing over a loop of the intro to Kanye West's ""Flashing Lights"", returning the nod towards ""Home Is Where the Hatred Is"" that underpinned <i>Late Registration</i>'s ""My Way Home"". But ""On Coming From a Broken Home"" is a powerful mission of purpose that sets the tone for the rest of the album, a reflection of his upbringing that made him the man he is today. ""Broken Home"" pays homage to the women in his family and the strengths they passed on to him; other interludes hint at darkly comic acknowledgements of wrongdoing, modest but defiant statements of enduring survival, and an admission that even his less desirable personality traits are an inseparable part of his identity.</p>
<p>Those brief interstitial statements link pieces of brain-wracked guilt and anxiety that rank as truly haunting moments: ""Where Did the Night Go"", a study in lonely insomnia and the inability to communicate with someone he loves, and the confession in ""New York Is Killing Me"" that the city that held him in an alienating grasp for so long-- ""eight million people, and I didn't have a single friend""-- only makes him long for the home in Tennessee he left at 13 after his grandmother died. It's an interesting contrast to the sentiment of his 1976 song ""New York City"", where he sang of a metropolis he loved because it reminded him of himself. Either the personalities of the man and the city have diverged too much, or they've gotten too close for comfort.</p>
<p>But the most noticeable thing about Scott-Heron on this album to anyone familiar with his work is how worn his voice sounds. It's raspier and age-weathered, less agile, and occasionally prone to letting words slur and melt into each other instead of leaping out as they did back in the 70s. But Richard Russell, the album's producer and owner of XL Recordings, hit on the idea of recasting a man who came up through soul-jazz as a grizzled blues performer, and setting Scott-Heron against sandblasted folk and heavy, borderline-industrial beats augments the rawness of his voice well. Three songs reveal him as an adept interpreter of three generations' worth of roots music: Robert Johnson's ""Me and the Devil"" rendered as vintage Massive Attack, a minimalist, piano-driven orchestral reworking of the Brook Benton-written Bobby ""Blue"" Bland classic ""I'll Take Care of You"", and the unexpected but deftly claimed title track, sourced from Smog. And two spare, static-textured cuts late in the album, ""Running"" and ""The Crutch"", give his equally-gritty voice a fitting place in the post-Burial strain of bass music.</p>
<p>For an album that comes so far after its creator's last trip to the studio, it's a bit of a relief that the only cause for disappointment is its brief length. <i>I'm New Here </i>is less than half an hour, though in that short span it does the impressive job of reviving an artist that's been out of the spotlight far too long and setting him up for a new incarnation as an elder statesman of modern roots music. Comparisons have been made to what Rick Rubin did for Johnny Cash in the 90s, and the parallels are there: <i>I'm New Here </i>and <i>American Recordings </i>are both cover-heavy, starkly-produced releases where rebellious icons become reflective as they hit their sixties. If Gil Scott-Heron's creative resurgence continues after this reintroduction to his poignantly aging voice, we could be looking at one of the most memorably resurrected careers of our time-- a man renewed.</p></div>"|13893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13893-im-new-here/|8.5|Nate Patrin

It may have lost some of the youthful agility that marked her work with guitarist Loren Conners in the 1980s, but she has gained a grace and gravity to match her age and experience. A cult figure from the tiny New Haven folk scene, Bloom is no retreating artist waiting to be rediscovered by a new generation: While she may not pursue music as determinedly as she once did, she never stopped recording or performing, whether solo or with a group of friends called the Love at Work Band. It's just that her records have usually been small-run releases, usually sold through her website and at the occasional show or folk-fest appearance. So credit goes to Australian label Chapter Music for giving her a wider audience by reissuing some of her 80s albums, collecting her 90s output on the 2007 comp <i>Finally</i>, releasing a strong collection of new material called <i>Terror</i>, and organizing a tribute album featuring Devendra Banhart, Bill Callahan, the Dodos, and Mark Kozelek.</p>
<p>Kozelek was apparently so taken with Bloom that he signed her to his Caldo Verde label and has released her latest album, <i>Thin Thin Line</i>. Again backed by members of the Love at Work Band, Bloom sounds like a woman who has spent years in the wilderness. Against the elegantly rustic folk backdrop, which swirls with fiddle and harmonica, she sings about fragile hearts and precarious relationships with tender, maternal authority (the album is dedicated to her son Jack). An earthy, unpretentious presence, she can snap a heart like a twig on the title track and ""Heart So Sadly"". Her voice is shaky and imprecise, but as always, it's all the more affecting for its imperfections. When she sings wordlessly and forcefully in her upper register on ""Another Point of View"", the effect is harrowing. When she whoops through ""I'm Thinking of Love"" or chirps out the sing-songy ""Freddie"", she sounds joyful even if her words are not.</p>
<p>This is an album about the thin line between happiness and sorrow. In conveying such emotional extremes, Bloom's songwriting remains startlingly direct in its plainspoken poetry. Bloom writes like she's working through problems, so her songs tend to build organically and gracefully. On ""Heart So Sadly"", she arrives at a sing-along melody that isn't just an effective hook, but a hard-won epiphany: ""This is good, this is great/ This is good, this is great."" It's simple, yet poignant. On ""Let's Get Living"", Bloom sings a chorus that in other hands might be simply a bromide: ""If we're living, let's get living."" In a sense, it's her ""Let's Get It On"", a desperate plea to move beyond arguments and grudges and just be together.

He's continued to record smart, affable power pop-- one record as the frontman of the band Georgie James, and now recording most everything himself under the name Title Tracks. If <i>It Was Easy</i>, his first full-length under the name, is any indication, it seems he's just getting started.</p>
<p>The record begins with his 2009 debut single, ""Every Little Bit Hurts"", which is a fine place to start: With just Davis' voice and guitar (and barely any drums at all), ""Every Little Bit Hurts"" is as unassuming as it is infectious, burrowing into the brain on the strength of just a few chords.  If you thought Ted Leo's mostly-solo <i>Tell Balgeary, Balgury Is Dead</i> EP should have been longer, this is a jam you need to hear.</p>
<p>But while Davis proves himself worthy as a one-man studio band, the record still seems sparse and somewhat bare. Most of the time, that works in his favor. Take his cover of Bruce Springsteen's ""Tougher Than the Rest"", re-imagined here as a Casio keyboard-led lullaby sung as a duet with Camera Obscura's Tracyanne Campbell. It's a departure for Davis, but is also a fine example of his ability to do less with more. (Granted, having a voice like Campbell's to assist you goes a long way; Camera Obscura recently released their own version of ""Tougher"" as a B-side to a recent single). On other songs, little details add up, sometimes changing the whole tone and feel of a track. The lazy skank of ""No, Girl"" opens with a surprising saxophone riff courtesy of Kriston Capps. And on ""Hello There"", dance-informed rhythms appear, lending the verses a syncopated buoyancy before a gentler, strummier B-section takes it somewhere else entirely.</p>
<p>The faster pace of tracks like ""Every Little Bit Hurts"" or ""Steady Love"", with their mouthful of syllables and quick phrasing, suit Davis' strengths. While he's a capable vocalist, it would take a voice with a lot of character to really sell tracks like the saccharine commercial jingle-like ""Black Bubblegum"" or the whisper-level intimacy of ""At Fifteen"". Davis has crafted a careful and infectious power-pop record on his own that's easy to love (especially for fans of the aforementioned Ted Leo or the New Pornographers). But while he's done the full-band frontman thing before in Georgie James, he might take Title Tracks even further if he pulls in some more helping hands with more of the canny decision-making he's made here.</p></div>"|13880.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13880-it-was-easy/|6.8|Jason Crock

They blend pianos, live drums, and techno-inspired electronics into invigorating displays of virtuosity, which evoke the club and the conservatory without really belonging to either one. (Their name is German for ""stairway""-- an intermediate place, neither here nor there.) Given to singing out ecstatically, Aufgang's self-titled debut highlights the emotional extravagance these two different worlds have in common. It sounds kind of posh on paper, but it's actually really buoyant and fun. It always makes me picture an anthropomorphic grand piano in an old Warner Bros. cartoon, bouncing on rubbery legs to its own irrepressible music.</p>
<p>We're not talking about indie rockers pasting a few major thirds and fifths onto a preset. This is serious piano playing. Rami Khalifé and Francesco Tristano both trained at Julliard. Khalifé is the son of Lebanese composer Marcel Khalifé, and Tristano is well-regarded for his recorded repertoire (which includes <i>The Goldberg Variations</i>, in fact). Drummer Aymeric Westrich contributes a lively yet understated attack, somewhere between the four-on-the-floor throbs of house and rock music.</p>
<p>Aufgang's dual education, in the nightclub and the academy, shows in the historical and stylistic range of their music. ""Barock"" is baroque, while ""Channel 7"" (which has already been winningly remixed by John Talabot) pays homage to DJ Rolando's ""Knights of the Jaguar"" with wave after wave of divebombing trills courtesy of Westrich, whose cinematic loops add drama to many tracks. Blindingly happy piano playing fills in for swept strings, like Schroeder from ""Peanuts"" riding a huge caffeine rush. You can tell they've studied their Satie, Glass, Bartók, Prokofiev, etc., but their music doesn't feel much like a master's thesis. It's earnest and rapturous, gliding elaborately in fast, intelligible currents.</p>
<p>Usually, at least. If you expect heat from every track, then <i>Aufgang </i>is far from a perfect album-- the songs are deeply contrasted, with almost no middle ground between the thunderclaps and long, sullen rumbles. Only ""3 Vitesses"" really explores that broad middle range of intensity, with insistently ticking drums and sharp-cornered, diabolical piano intervals that continually dodge comfortable resolution. For attention-grabbers, you've basically got ""Channel 7"" and ""Barock""; ""Sonar"", which has the album's most sure-footed build-up; ""Good Generation"", where rolling, 1970s-sounding pianos blur into sparkly electro; and ""Aufgang"", which admits a little rowdy acid into the mix.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, ""Prelude Du Passé"" crawls at a glacial pace, and ""Soumission"" closes the album with over 10 minutes of dissonant, decaying chords. It can be hard to get all the way through that one, knowing that the unstoppable ""Channel 7"" is about to wrap around. But the more austere tracks underscore something good about Aufgang. They don't just charge straight for the rafters; they pause, reconsider, begin again. They ask the listener to flip back and forth between patience and euphoria on cue, over and over. For those willing to do so, the gemlike clarity of the album's peaks feel even harder and brighter.</p></div>"|13875.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13875-aufgang/|7.7|Brian Howe

Flashing through late-1970s New York, the movement came off as a nihilistic plot to first dismantle punk rock, then abandon it. The funny thing is, the perpetrators didn't exactly run off and hide. Before the dust had settled, many No Wavers were already reworking their ideas into new forms that actually lasted longer than the original spark. Some, like Glenn Branca and Rhys Chatham, morphed rock experiments into avant-garde minimalism, which in turn spawned the noise-rock of Swans and Sonic Youth. Others, like James Chance and Pat Place of the Contortions, created disco-damaged punk-funk that led to the stripped-down dance of ESG and Liquid Liquid. Though those two post-No Wave trends shared some participants, there was a vague line between them. To oversimplify, one side was rock, the other dance.</p>
<p>It turns out that at least one band, Interference, straddled that divide. But their innovations were hidden, because their only recording-- a 1982 debut slated for release on Branca's Neutral label-- never came out. Now Social Registry has rescued it from the vaults (though Branca <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2009/12/16/interference-excerpt-1-version-1-mp3/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">claims</a> that this version<i> </i>is different than what the band gave Neutral). The six original songs on the first half of this 2xLP set sound like a missing link between Branca's pioneering symphonies and ESG's seminal funk.</p>
<p>The former style was something in which Interference were clearly versed-- drummer David Linton and bassist Michael Brown both played in Chatham's ensemble the Din, while multi-instrumentalist Anne DeMarinis was in the first incarnation of Sonic Youth. Still, Interference must have been equally attentive to the downtown dance-rock developing in the early 80s. The band's blend of chiming guitars, rattling rhythms, dark bass grooves, and cresting noise feels less like a stylistic hybrid than an organic swirl of body-moving thought and head-bobbing momentum.</p>
<p>That comes across strongest on the two densest tracks-- ""Excerpt #1 (Version 2)"", which at times sounds like an extended instrumental take on Bush Tetras' downtown classic ""Too Many Creeps"", and ""Contempt"", a snaky grove that evokes the nervous energy of DNA or the Feelies, but whose insistent beat feels timeless. Things tip further to the avant-rock side on closer ""Number Four"". Its frantic rush recalls the slam-rock symphonics of Chatham's ""Drastic Classicism"" (a song Linton and Brown actually played on). But even that track feels remarkably fresh, like something you wouldn't be surprised to hear blasting from a Magik Markers or Talk Normal album.</p>
<p>That timelessness makes the second half of <i>Interference-- </i>a bonus LP with six new remixes-- more than just tacked-on filler. Linton has been involved in the New York avant-electronic scene for a while, and his choice of remixers is sharp. All of them rework a funkier version of ""Excerpt #1"" (the original of which Social Registry offers as a bonus digital download). I'm partial to the QPE ""#5 Dub"", which matches Brown's thick bass line to a detached hip-hop lope, and Criterion's ""Interferix"", a marriage of hard beats and warpy echo. But all six remixes show the richness of Interference's music, which after nearly three decades of hidden fermentation sounds as vital as it must have to anyone who witnessed it back then.</p></div>"|13909.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13909-interference/|7.5|Marc Masters

As the moods of their albums gradually transitioned from refined soul to grimy abrasion on <i>Blue Lines</i>, <i>Protection</i>, and <i>Mezzanine</i>, they used that balance to toy with the emotional structure of their sound. The result was some of the decade's most haunting, forward-thinking music. Depending on how and when you listen, the same Massive Attack song can creep you out, fill you with sorrow, or send you into a deep reverie. The best ones do it all at once.</p>
<p>Many fans consider what little music Massive Attack released since <i>Mezzanine</i> to be a retreat of sorts, and it's true that they may have lost something with each original member that split off-- namely the hip-hop sensibility of Andrew ""Mushroom"" Vowles and the frigid snarl of Grant ""Daddy G"" Marshall. Their next release, 2003's <i>100th Window</i>, seemed like a creative holding pattern brought on by the group's personnel situation, but it did have a few moments of sinister beauty. <i>Heligoland</i>-- the first non-soundtrack Massive Attack album in seven years and the first with Daddy G back on board in 12-- misses that quality. The undercurrent of menace and sadness that defined Massive Attack's best music is largely absent, replaced with a drowsy, half-formed gloom that, if anything, suggests resignation instead of dread.</p>
<p>Last fall's <i>Splitting the Atom</i> EP offered a couple of warning signs that reappear on this album. ""Pray for Rain"" is a woozy, overlong dirge redeemed only by Tunde Adebimpe's rich voice, the only instrument that bothers with anything approaching dynamics. And the EP's title track, which reunited the voices of Daddy G, Horace Andy, and Robert ""3D"" Del Naja over achy-kneed downtempo electro, just blithely rotates in place alongside a dead-eyed organ riff like a beat-to-shit merry-go-round. The potential of both these tracks-- strong vocalists carrying a sense of weariness over bleak ambiance-- is sabotaged by the music's unwillingness to rise, crest, and fall, to shift momentum or volume, to do anything more than sulk in the background with its hands in its pockets, kicking at the ground.</p>
<p>That problem becomes more obvious throughout the rest of the album, especially when you're hit with one of its exceptions. ""Girl I Love You"" is a bracing embodiment of everything that made those classic Horace Andy-fronted Massive Attack tracks so great: a half-Reznor, half-Gaye backbeat; ghostly filtered guitars and snarling blasts of brass; that exceptional voice transfusing vintage lover's rock into harrowing cries for help. It completely annihilates nearly everything else on the album: the watery, choppy acoustic guitar loops that underpin Martina Topley-Bird on ""Psyche"", which sound like something Dan Deacon would come up with if he was scared of being abrasive; the listless half-skank of Hope Sandoval spotlight ""Paradise Circus""; the Damon Albarn-feels-sad moment ""Saturday Come Slow"", which sounds kind of like Blur's ""Sweet Song"" with all the hope drained out.</p>
<p>And note those names, 90s icons all-- they're a quick and easy shorthand if you need to point out how little <i>Heligoland </i>engages with current music. Since <i>100th Window</i>, the post-hip-hop landscape of bass music has extrapolated into an endlessly creative nebula of dubstep, wonky, UK funky, Balearic, and other rich veins of style. And how does this album engage with it? By closing out with a track, ""Atlas Air"", that sounds kind of like Aeroplane bliss-disco trying to be as creepy as the Knife. Elsewhere, we get a flimsy New Order pastiche (""Rush Minute"") and glitchy quasi-jungle (""Babel"") to show for it. Burial's been given these tracks for a potential <i>No Protection </i>treatment, so there's that, at least, but it's a shame to think that it'll take an outside producer to salvage this stuff rather than simply reinterpret it.</p>
<p>So what does an album this defeatist-sounding have to say? It just so happens to come at a time where defeatism feels pretty natural, and ironically that makes these songs feel even harder to relate to. When Daddy G mutters despairingly how there's ""No hope without dope/ The jobless return/ The bankers have bailed"" on ""Splitting the Atom"" or Elbow's Guy Garvey moans fearfully about home insecurity on ""Flat of the Blade"", it feels of-the-moment-- but part of a moment you want to break out of because the malaise feels suffocating. Anxiety is one thing, hopelessness is another entirely. And when your whole world can feel, in the words of ""Pray for Rain"", like a ""dull residue of what once was,"" it's probably better to wait for an album that can't be described the same way.</p></div>"|13864.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13864-heligoland/|5.0|Nate Patrin

Featuring 24 minutes of reverby guitars and spluttery drums careening around singer/keyboardist Rebekah Raa's hook-heavy character sketches, it's a fine record; despite its length, it's fleshed out and full of flourish. If anything, it's all over way too soon. If only they knew more people.</p>
<p>There's something wonderfully ramshackle and even a little weird about the songs on <i>Songs</i>, from the creaky Victrola of opener ""Gifted"" (apparently recorded in a London bus) to the unspooling C86 haze that covers the rest. Bleary guitars, tricky rhythms, and Raa's ascendant vocal melodies seem engaged in a tug of war, and even the odd ballad feels, well, odd when cast in their able amble. The best tunes here aren't too fitful to be unruly or even undancable, yet their muddled construction always seems to threaten a topple. It's Raa who holds it all together, her voice dipping and soaring over these tunes, a little like a looser Sue Tompkins from Life Without Buildings. Even with an oddball backdrop, an unlikely vocal melody, over an unruly pile of guitars, Raa finds a way to captivate, and without much apparent effort.</p>
<p>The intimate portraits promised in the title don't quite materialize-- most songs are about people you know, y'know-- but the legit pangs of longing in Raa's voice lead one to believe she entered the booth for every tune with somebody specific in mind, even when the sentiments feel a little general. The accordion-led ""Sometimes I Love You"" leans that way-- sometimes she hates you, too-- but, on the strength of its unique arrangement and Raa's resigned vocal, you'll barely notice. Stark closer ""Terrible Things"" smacks of PJ Harvey's bleak <i>White Chalk</i>, and Raa, much like Polly Jean Harvey, conveys an awful lot even when she doesn't seem to be saying much. There's just so much ground covered here that throwing something else at them, like a more complicated lyric, might prove their tipping point. As it stands, though, Songs is a series of small successes in slightly askew songcraft.</p></div>"|13907.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13907-songs-about-people-i-know/|7.5|Paul Thompson

The label has always kept an eye on the under-underground, putting out Postal Service with one hand while sneaking out a Wolf Eyes album with the other-- not to mention releasing the final record by the still-underrated A-Frames, some of whose members make up AFCGT. But if you were looking for the dark minimalist guitar rock of that band (or their offshoot, the Intelligence), AFCGT ain't it; and even if you were familiar with the drones and sound collages of Climax Golden Twins, among whose members also make AFCGT, you still likely aren't prepared for what this record sounds like. The meeting of the atmospheric and the angular takes both approaches to someplace often bewildering and wholly unexpected. Even among the sub-genres that make up noise and drone, they still defy categorization.</p>
<p>It's not very mixtape-friendly, but given the members' respective backgrounds, the band's palette is stunningly large. ""Black Mark"" has a two-note riff that sounds on the verge of collapse before it finally does break. ""Two-Legged Dog"" stretches some muted, watery guitar chords on a loop, over which squealing, textural guitar congeals into a thick psychedelic stew. ""New Punk 27"" stops and starts in fits, with grooves and riffs rising out of full-band chaos, and ""Reasonably Nautical"" is an uneasy rising drone of washed-out guitar, field recordings, and white noise. ""Nacht"" and ""Slide 9"" are ominous almost-grooves of cymbal taps and guitar squiggles; the former has vocals, but modulated down to a thick drawl and in a foreign language. You may have heard some of this before, but never put together in quite such a way.</p>
<p>It's clear the group is more concerned with courting chaos and incorporating it into their compositions than they are with verse-chorus-verse. That said, there are moments, flashes, and vibes here that are indelible, like the teeth-grinding groove that closes ""Nacht"" or the moments of ""New Punk"" where the jarring quick edits drop away to anguished, muffled vocals. One gets the feeling AFCGT are continually re-editing and re-contextualizing snippets from one strange, endless jam. The pieces on this particular release are disparate-- even earlier AFCGT releases had more of a band-in-the-room feel to them-- but it's a trade-off to show what different sounds the band can summon, which are often fascinating and affecting.</p></div>"|13869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13869-afcgt/|6.5|Jason Crock

The more of their stuff I tracked down-- and there's a <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Robedoor"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lot</a> of it-- the more vivid that image became, convincing me they were heirs to the path carved by Double Leopards, Axolotl, My Cat Is an Alien, and Yellow Swans. But others feel Robedoor's entrancing combo of heavy atmosphere, endless vibrations, and dark, dense tones makes them more a doom-metal band with drone overtones-- like a looser, grimier version of Sleep or Sunn O))).</p>
<p>That distinction may ultimately be academic, but whatever they were before, Robedoor<i> </i>may have finally swung their pendulum toward doom-metal. Easily their most song-oriented effort, <i>Raiders</i> is driven by Sabbath-y bass chug, momentous crash/pound drumming, and moaning vocals that conjure a Satanic ritual. Alex and Britt Brown (no relation) have dabbled in beats and riffs before, but here they fully commit, letting their swirling noises and enveloping drones grow out of patterns rather than vice versa. The effect is intentional-- as Britt recently told me in an email, their goal was ""to consolidate all the sprawling dungeon improv Robedoor aesthetics into shorter, replicable songs.""</p>
<p><i>Raiders</i> is certainly the first Robedoor record that I've found myself humming along to. The big fat bass riff on ""Indo Shadow"" (played by longtime Robedoor producer Ged Gengras) is instantly memorable, launching the Browns into starry guitar/drum cacophony. Fourteen-minute closer ""The Downcast Eye"" takes a similar tack, rocking like a creaky boat on a foggy, black sea. ""The downcast eye is the only eye I know,"" Britt intones, suggesting a vision darker than that of the L.A. bands Robedoor share stages and labels with (Britt runs Not Not Fun with his wife Amanda of Pocahaunted). But somehow the band's blurry, hallucinatory music makes underground L.A. seem just as dreamlike as it does in sunnier work by groups like the Mae Shi and Foot Village.</p>
<p>Still, Robedoor fit best in the global drone underground, and with lots of the best bands drifting away-- Yellow Swans broke up in 2008, and Double Leopards have been on extended hiatus since before then-- the Browns have become flame-keepers alongside Emeralds, Black to Comm, Jazzfinger, and Sun Araw. It's a role they may be too modest to claim, but judging by <i>Raiders </i>(and the forthcoming <i>Burners, </i>another song-oriented affair and their first album as a trio with Gengras)<i>,</i> the drone fire is in good hands.</p></div>"|13851.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13851-raiders/|7.2|Marc Masters

The history of recorded sound only stretches back to 1878 (1857 if you count the phonautograph), but in that time, output has been prodigious, on the order of millions of recordings, many of which are lost. How cool would it be to walk into an Indiana Jones-like warehouse with the entire unabridged catalog of Columbia Records, a company that's made recordings since 1888? Of course, no such place exists-- the many large companies that made records worldwide through the middle of the 20th century had no central warehouses where everything was gathered, and the smaller labels often suffered from lack of organization and resources. If your offices burned in a war, well, that was it for your archives.</p>
<p>Cuba's EGREM (Empresa de Grabaciones y Ediciones Musicales-- literally ""Music Recording and Publishing Company"") is one of the many labels whose history I'd love to tour. It is the product of revolution, founded in 1964 after Castro and his government had consolidated their power, and it's been the sole entity responsible for documenting Cuban sounds on record ever since. While the generic name reflects the ideology of its communist overlords, the label has played host to a mind-boggling array of soulful, vital, innovative, and inventive music. On the first <i>Si, Para Usted</i> volume, Waxing Deep exposed a clutch of funky, sometimes psychedelic recordings from the 1970s and 80s that showed that the changes that swept through the world's pop music in the decade previous didn't leave Cuba behind in spite of the suffocating political environment. Here, they've gone even deeper, jettisoning many of the known names of the first volume in favor of mostly unfamiliar artists.</p>
<p>Some of these artists recorded only one or two songs, owing mostly to the arbitrary nature and complete lack of business sense that characterized the Cuban music business. Los Barba, for example, was one of the most popular bands in the country but never made an album. Which is a shame, because ""Al Sonar La Hora"" suggests they were exceedingly capable, with swelling horn accents, slashing psychedelic guitar, tweaked organ solos, and dead-on harmony vocals that come out of nowhere for the chorus. Most recordings made in Cuba were by acts on the government payroll, but there are a few LPs of amateur bands floating around. These featured non-professional (as in, not employed by the government) groups who performed well in national arts and culture festivals, and the examples included here are inspired. Combo Los Caribe's ""Andalucía"" has elements of surf, exotica, and 60s now-sound records layered onto its Cuban rhythms, while on ""Safari Salvaje"", Los Rápidos open with a wild Afro-Cuban barrage of drums and incantation, only to blindside you with a crackling drum fill and an onslaught of chicken scratch guitar.</p>
<p>As much as they tried, Cuba's censors couldn't beat back the tide of American music. The island is close enough to Miami to hear its radio stations, which is probably how Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna managed a version of Ides of March's 1970 horn rock hit ""Vehicle"". Theirs is a crazy, funky instrumental that ends with a garage rock organ quotation of Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue in D Minor"". Cuban musicians may have operated with a great many more constraints than their counterparts up north, but their exploratory spirit and artistic invention was no less vibrant, and it's great that we're finally getting to hear some of this music, presented with a great deal of background information.

Delivering lines about ""20-inch rims"" and ""Yo La Tengo"" in a proper English accent, as they did on their 2005 debut, can have that effect. Yet on their two subsequent records-- 2006's <i>The Warning</i> and 2008's <i>Made in the Dark</i>-- Hot Chip steadily rebuilt their reputation  by toughening up their sophistipop side. Their melodies began to develop an itchy, nervous twitch, and they earned dancefloor credibility through an association with DFA.</p>
<p>Best of all, Hot Chip crafted some of the sneakiest and most effective earworms around-- songs that seem deceptively simple and assuming on first listen became year-end list locks by listen number 10. Their quirky detours, winks, and nods were no longer Prince and Stevie Wonder shoutouts; instead, they were subtler, so the band that initially came across as affable goofballs eventually revealed themselves to be the smartest guys in the room. In short, after a half-decade of having our expectations challenged and any hesitations about them erased, it finally felt like we knew who Hot Chip were. But their fourth album, <i>One Life Stand</i>, changes things a bit. After dialing back some of their eccentricities, their latest feels if anything even more likely to be underestimated.</p>
<p>Oddly, this is arguably their best record yet. Whether you'll agree will depend on what you want from Hot Chip and what you want from an album. <i>One Life Stand</i> is their most consistent and most complete record, but it's missing an A-list single on par with ""Boy From School"", ""Over and Over"", or ""Ready for the Floor"". It's also missing dance songs in the mode of the latter two, focusing instead on Hot Chip at their most lush and romantic. Some will claim it's them growing up, but that's not true-- they've always exhibited panache and sophistication. This is simply the first time since their debut that they've primarily honed in on those sensibilities, in the process revealing just how far they've come sonically in the past five years.</p>
<p>It's a bold move but well earned. The band's split personality was in full effect on <i>Made in the Dark</i>, which flitted between heart-on-sleeve songs like ""We're Looking for a Lot of Love"" and ""One Pure Thought"" and nebbishy hip-shakers like ""Shake a Fist"" and ""Bendable Poseable"". If you wanted a record of the former without the latter, well you're in luck, because that's basically what you have here. As Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal pointed out to me, it's a move akin to the one Pet Shop Boys took circa <i>Behaviour</i>-- a near-shedding of their more overt disco and house influences and an embrace of personal songwriting free of irony or distance.</p>
<p>Because the songs not only share mood and tone but also are generally of the same high quality, <i>One Life Stand</i> has a sense of consistency and completeness missing from their other records, too. At its most basic, <i>One Life Stand</i> is a record of love songs; more specifically, it's often a record of self-actualization and redemption-- of recognizing our need for real human connection. Whether about romance or friendship, the songs on <i>One Life Stand</i> are often about commitment (as the album title indicates) and reciprocal relationships. These qualities aren't typically celebrated in pop culture-- stable monogamy and sensitive male bonding don't have the inherent drama of a star-crossed, fleeting, or unrequited love, after all.</p>
<p>And yet Hot Chip locate the beauty and power in commitment and in stability. Fully two-thirds of the record is built upon proclamations of long-lasting love, which is made clear in many of the record's key lyrics: ""You are my love light,"" ""I only wanna be your one life stand,"" ""Please take my heart and keep it close to you,"" ""Happiness is what we all want,"" ""I only want one life together in our arms.""</p>
<p>If that seems like a sort of bait and switch, then you've <i>really</i> underestimated Hot Chip, because they've been trading in this sort of sincerity for years. On the one hand, between their inauspicious start, geek-chic dancefloor excursions, and videos, Hot Chip can be viewed as wired, robotic, almost anti-human. Yet Hot Chip have functioned as sort of a mirror image of intelligent, dryly confessional 1980s bands like ABC and the Pet Shop Boys: Whereas lyricists like Martin Fry and Neil Tennant smuggled cynicism into the Top 40, Hot Chip sneak sincerity into an indie electro-pop scene dominated at times by the dress-up of blog-house. Perhaps it's no coincidence then that the best of their peers-- electro-soul brothers-in-arms Junior Boys and big-room dance stars Justice-- are also so straight-faced that people also assumed at first they were each a put-on. And each of the three is far outstripping those chasing fads. (Hey, where's that Uffie record we've been ""promised""?)</p>
<p>Weirdly, the songs here most likely to turn people off aren't the odes to everlasting love, but those explicitly about the importance of male connection (""Brothers"") or the quest for spiritual guidance (""Slush""). And yet these are the record's twin centerpieces. Neither is as embraceable as singles and potential singles ""One Life Stand"", ""Take It In"", ""Hand Me Down Your Love"", or ""I Feel Better"", but they're the tracks that elevate the record from a collection of very good songs to a complete picture of an important band near the peak of its powers. Whether Hot Chip now stay in this headspace and sonic range-- perhaps there is a record full of nervy, upbeat and/or more tongue-in-cheek songs á la ""The Warning"" or ""Wrestler"" next-- won't obscure the risk they've taken here by fully embracing big-hearted electro-pop. And it won't obscure how successfully they've done it either.</p></div>"|13908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13908-one-life-stand/|8.4|Scott Plagenhoef

He lived a long and productive life, giving a great deal of marvelous recorded music to the world, seeking ways to bridge the regional musical traditions of his homeland, Mali, and developing a guitar style all his own. He recorded only a few times in the final years of his life, having retired to become the mayor of his hometown, Niafunké-- he used his own money to improve the roads and sewage system, and fueled the town's generator as well. The recordings on this album, the second collaboration between Touré and Diabaté after 2005's justly lauded <i>In the Heart of the Moon</i>, are the last Touré ever made, and they are uncommonly beautiful.</p>
<p>Diabaté is a 71st-generation musician, and his mastery of the harp-like kora is complete. He's perfectly comfortable playing traditional songs that stretch back centuries or sitting in on a Björk album, and to hear him play with Touré is a treat. These two men, so different in age and background, nonetheless seem to inhabit the same mind for the length of the sessions. They are joined here and there by guest musicians, including Touré's son, Vieux, and legendary Cuban double bassist Orlando ""Cachaíto"" López (this is also his final recording), but the focus is on the interplay between the two principles. Touré treated the sessions as though he knew they may be his last, returning to his roots to play ""Sina Mory"", the song that inspired him to pick up the guitar in 1956, and ""Sabu Yerkoy"", a celebration of Malian independence in his repertoire since the 60s, but recorded only this one time.</p>
<p>For as much pain as he was apparently in, Touré's guitar work sounds untouched by illness. In fact, his playing on opener ""Ruby""-- named by Touré for producer Nick Gold's young daughter-- is so supple and intuitive that he sounds like a much younger man as Diabaté joins him, surrounding his hypnotic figures with fluid runs on the kora. They brilliantly display their telepathic sympathy during on-the-spot improvisation ""Fantasy"", which finds Touré creating a series of anchoring phrases for Diabaté to leap off. On ""Samba Geladio"", you can begin to hear the ways in which Touré's music was a cousin of (but not derived from nor a direct source for) the blues as he pulls some ferocious phrases from his acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>Gold and engineer Jerry Boys captured these sessions with uncompromising intimacy-- if you turn it up you can hear the creak of chairs and even a cough. You get the feel of two of the world's greatest musicians in a room together, having a conversation and creating a document that will carry their legacy into the future. It is not challenging music. Anyone can approach it easily, and it is the perfect initiation to Touré's talents for listeners who haven't yet heard him.</p></div>"|13883.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13883-ali-and-toumani/|8.3|Joe Tangari

So convincingly did the band and the singer transform the song and reset it in a soul-historical context that apparently many listeners, as yet unfamiliar with the band or with Daptone's mission, assumed that this was the original, exhumed after so many decades of obscurity, and that Jackson's was actually the cover. Daptone, however, is not a reissue label. It releases primarily new recordings often featuring old singers, studiously re-creating the sounds of 1960s and 70s soul, as if to unhinge that style from history and prove it timeless, sceneless. The label has been praised for the precision of its revivalism as well as the strength of its roster, which includes Sharon Jones, Lee Fields, and the Budos Band, among others. There's a fine line, however, between revivalism and slavish mimicry, and the concern for historical fidelity that has garnered praise for Daptone acts has caused other contemporary bands to be routinely dismissed for sounding too much like 70s Laurel Canyon folk-rock or 80s Mancunian post-punk. So why shouldn't the same critical standard apply to Daptone?</p>
<p><i>Daptone Gold,</i> which is either a very savvy label sampler or a very generous greatest hits, goes a long way toward answering that question. The nearly two dozen songs gathered here-- some new and familiar, others previously unreleased-- cover a lot of territory, from the urbanized (i.e., pre-Guiliani New York) afrofunk sounds of Antibalas to the soul-jazz struts of the Budos Band to the sanctified, secularized gospel of Naomi Shelton to the old-soul wallop of figureheads Sharon Jones and Lee Fields. Daptone's reach is both deep and wide, looking not to specific scenes or personalities from soul history, but to a generalized conception of the past as fertile territory for musical exploration. In other words, <i>Daptone Gold</i> (which features liner notes by Pitchfork contributor Douglas Wolk) benefits not so much from its associations with Stax or Motown or Philly or Hi or any other prestigious label, but from the excitement and directness of the music itself.</p>
<p>The players not only know their history, but they have the chops to translate that knowledge into music that only rarely sounds academic. The Budos Band apparently live in the pocket: On their three songs on <i>Daptone Gold</i>, the horns, percussion, and rhythm guitar immediately click into place and never let up. Especially on ""Budos Rising"", the horns soar precipitously over the prickly guitar licks and rumbling bongo funk, creating a tense call-and-response with the organ. Similarly, the groove on Antibalas' makossa-style cover of Hector Lavoe's ""Che Che Cole"" seems propelled by gravity itself, clicking in sweetly with Mayra Vega's spry vocals. And the Dap-Kings, which are more or less the Daptone house band even though they're most commonly identified with Sharon Jones, construct dense grooves that allow space for scribbles of saxophone and organ. On the instrumental ""Nervous Like Me"", the reeds completely lose their shit while the guitar keeps everything together with a four-note theme. It's chaos rough-drafted into something barely orderly.</p>
<p>As with the label, <i>Daptone Gold</i> lives and dies on personality. Binky Griptite's intro promising ""four solid sides of soul"" almost sinks the revivalism into kitsch, although his guitar playing on the B-side ""The Stroll Part 2"", recorded with the Mellomatics, proves he's a more inventive guitarist than singer. He shows a limited vocal and emotional range on ""A Lover Like Me"", but that may have less to do with his innate talents than with the company he keeps. Lee Fields shreds his vocal chords on the soul excoriation ""Could Have Been"", constantly threatening to go too far over the top but always pulling back at just the right moment. It's a measured, heart-rending performance that transcends retro assumptions, a telling counterpoint to the gimmicky skit he performs on ""Stranded in Your Love"", a duet with Sharon Jones.</p>
<p>Exuding unbridled sass and boundless energy whether on stage or in the studio, Jones is arguably Daptone's biggest act, and she gets seven tracks on <i>Gold</i>. ""I'm Not Gonna Cry"" and ""How Long Do I Have to Wait?"" are stalwart soul songs of remarkable emotional complexity, and ""Got a Thing on My Mind"", from her 2002 debut, is a tongue-twisting take on social ills-- a protest party song. And even if her cover of Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips' ""Giving Up"" sounds a bit clunky, especially compared to superlative covers of Janet Jackson, Woody Guthrie, and Prince, Jones nevertheless makes you believe she and Daptone are the real thing.</p></div>"|13780.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13780-daptone-gold/|6.6|Stephen M.

Stylistically diverse-- almost to a fault-- the record proved Bulat to be as comfortable with lilting waltz-time folk as jazz-cadenced pop as licensable indie catnip. Howard Bilerman (Arcade Fire, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, British Sea Power) worked with Bulat, and though they at times nudged the taste needle with torrid pianos and flowery strings, <i>Darling</i> successfully balanced slick studio intervention with a charming handmade rustle and clatter (not to mention a lot of enthusiastic handclapping).</p>
<p>But while Bulat's versatility's a selling point, it's her rare, extraordinary voice that makes her a fresh find in the notoriously musty folk-pop bin. Graceful and incandescent, confident but approachable, her alto's the aural equivalent of the perfect party host who makes every guest not only welcome, but certain they're the most important person in the room. ""Oh oh oh, I've done myself in,"" she laments on ""Sugar and Spice"", a song from new album, <i>Heart of My Own</i>, that traces the self-obliterating nature of love. And it seems like she's sharing her secret with you and you alone. It probably goes without saying that Bulat's flush-with-feeling lyrics aren't going to appeal to the more cynical consumers of singer-songwriter fare. (Then again, you could count those oxymoronic individuals on two hands.) Did I mention that while she plays most of the instruments on her record, Bulat favors the humble autoharp, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hANYD0_qQl4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">clutching it to her chest</a> like a Victorian nursemaid with an infant?</p>
<p>It's a mistake to read Bulat's songs as pre-Raphaelite pictorials or confessional Lilith Fair bait, though. For one thing, Bulat's brother Bobby's urgent, jittery, even martial drum work is thoroughly contemporary and continually prods <i>Heart</i>'s songs into scrambling motion. Spectacular album opener ""Go On"" pairs hit-the-road-Jack sentiments with a rapid ramp-up to runaway train rhythms. ""Gold Rush"", wisely released as the LP's first single, interprets ""rush"" literally, with stomped beats, gushing strings, and Bulat's fevered vocal performance. This last track references the album's primary inspiration, Canada's isolated Yukon Territory. Bulat stopped and wrote a batch of songs on her last tour in tiny Dawson City, and you can practically hear the north wind's raw melancholy burn on tunes like the otherwise frisky title track.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <i>Heart</i>'s production isn't always successful. Bulat seems out of breath competing with the brute-forced keyboards of ""Walk You Down"". And despite all the ace moments in ""Gold Rush"", what sounds like a choir's ""ah ah ah ahs"" that sneak in on the song's bridge sound stolen from Arcade Fire's <i>Funeral</i> sessions. Not only does such embellishment gild the lily in an already crowded hothouse, but it dates the song five years. Possibly more distracting are the precious sleigh bells roped around ""Run""'s neck and mixed too high. I think I speak for everyone when I say so soon after the holidays: I don't want to hear another goddamned jingle bell for at least 10 months.</p>
<p>But the album shakes such shackles often enough to maintain an atmosphere of warm intimacy. Bulat's shown an affinity for gospel in the past, covering Sam Cooke's ""Touch the Hem of His Garment"" live, and I had to doublecheck that the soul-baring, organ-burred album closer, ""If It Rains"", isn't a traditional praise song (nope, Bulat wrote it). Because her voice, all on its own, sells the material with such bolded, exclamation-pointed certainty that she might as well be singing amens.</p></div>"|13903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13903-heart-of-my-own/|7.0|Amy Granzin

Their sisterly harmonies, so tight and effortless they seemingly could only be the product of twins, have taken them far-- most notably landing them a job adding 1970s country window dressing to Jenny Lewis' <i>Rabbit Fur Coat</i>. Those voices also got them a deal at Vanguard Records and a modest following well outside of Los Angeles. On the other hand, their first EP and debut LP highlighted those voices primarily by stripping everything else away, leaving their vocals to anchor subpar songs, and an anonymous musical backdrop that placed them squarely in an L.A. folk-rock revival alongside far less agile groups like the Chapin Sisters, Biirdie, and the Winter Flowers.</p>
<p>The Twins' second full-length-- <i>Talking to You, Talking to Me-- </i>shows they have more reach and personality than most of their contemporaries, not by proving them more capable singers but by amping up their accompaniment. In fact there are actually fewer showboating harmonies on this record and a greater reliance on solo singing. Typically, one of the Twins takes the lead, and the other either provides backing oohs and aahs or drops in to emphasize certain phrases. It's a crafty trick that makes their lyrics sound a bit more barbed than they actually are. That's how they approach ""Devil in You"", with one of them singing the verses and the other joining in on the chorus to give the lyrics more bite: ""Well, the devil in you tried to tell me what to do/ I don't think so."" There are, of course, still some sleepy moments that are more pretty than pointed: ""Snow Canyons"" begins softly, adding a few instruments but never really going anywhere, and ""Tell Me Why"" is perhaps the tweest thing the sisters have ever recorded.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Twins got bored with the same old canyon-rock sound, or perhaps the touring for <i>Fire Songs</i> transformed their makeshift band into a tight unit, or perhaps they realized they could never distinguish themselves by blending in, but on <i>Talking to You</i> they have given their backing musicians freer rein with the arrangements, essentially placing equal emphasis on vocals and music. That much is evident from the opener, ""Modern Man"", which trips along on a prominent beat that makes the most of a closed high hat. The percussive organ strikes lend ""Harpeth River"" its Portisheadiness, but the organ really gets going on ""Midnight"", dogging the vocal melody, spackling the spaces in the verses, and finally tearing the song down with a lengthy solo. The band amplifies these songs not just sonically but thematically, bolstering the walking-on-a-wire sensibility of slower numbers like ""Forever Me"" and ""U N Me"". In general, <i>Talking to You</i> sounds like an album that is gradually divorcing itself from history and geography, as the Twins learn to build on that West Coast sound to create something unique and personal. They're not there yet, but give them another tour.</p></div>"|13905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13905-talking-to-you-talking-to-me/|6.4|Stephen M. Deusner

After migrating to South America with African slaves, it caught on big, gaining its Latin name and becoming the national instrument of Guatemala. When it reached the United States in the early 20th century, the marimba was welcomed into symphony orchestras and jazz ensembles, who appreciate the instrument's deep, resonant sound.</p>
<p>So leave it to Spencer Krug to put an idiosyncratic spin on the instrument on his <i>Dreamland</i> EP, helpfully and truthfully subtitled <i>Marimba and Shit-Drums</i>. As a love letter, Krug's EP, a single 20-minute track, is closer to a novella than a valentine. The result could have been idle indie rock tourism, but Krug clearly spent some time learning his way around the marimba's blocks, making an instrument rarely encountered in rock into an appropriate vehicle for the REM sleep journey the song narrates.</p>
<p>As Krug plays it, the marimba is versatile. At low tones, it sounds like someone dribbling a ceramic basketball around an empty gym. Run a rapid tempo on the high tones, and it sounds like a wind chime caught in a hurricane, or a slot machine symphony. Through the instrumental segments the blocks' woodier vibrations start bleeding together into a gamelan-style pointillist drone. But Krug escapes strictly avant-garde territory, layering melodies until they take on the busy, crowded quality of an 8-bit RPG's dream sequence music.</p>
<p>Still, thank goodness for the shit-drums, which are appropriately named in terms of their fidelity. Every time the marimba waves threaten to engulf Krug, the drums splash in like a life preserver, adding a welcome sonic backbone. The song's most radio-friendly segment is just such a moment-- eight minutes in, where Krug's hazy beach visions are suddenly made urgent by a clattering drum part and geysers of spiraling melodies.</p>
<p>The sloppiness of those shit-drums may be what keeps Krug's composition from being a stripped-down version of a Tortoise epic-- the back half of ""Djed"" isn't too distant of a cousin. But I'm also reminded, more recently, of Destroyer's ""Bay of Pigs"", last year's example of an indie icon working with elongated song length and unfamiliar instruments. There's a dream logic to both songs, a sense of progression and narrative despite cut-and-paste lyrics, and each has a slowly unspooling structure that brings to mind a palindrome. There's even a satisfying resolution, where Krug drums the listener back to wakefulness while meta-commentating on the instrumentation by concluding in double-track, ""I am making hissing sounds with my mouth.""</p>
<p>Those are the moments that make <i>Marimba and Shit-Drums</i> more than just a gimmicky stylistic constraint. Thanks to the contradictions of the marimba-- soft, delicate tones generated through mallet thwacks-- Krug is able to hit just the right emotional note, conjuring an otherworldly and anxious dream-filled night. Like anyone recapping their dreams for you, it's sometimes uncomfortably voyeuristic, but the unusual arrangements make it much easier to take.</p></div>"|13899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13899-dreamland-ep-marimba-and-shit-drums/|7.5|Rob Mitchum

But listening to the band's second album (and first under the new handle) the name-switcheroo scheme now feels appropriately symbolic of the band's evolving personality: Their two-minute missives still charge ahead with jangle-punk strums, pedal-to-the-floor backbeats, and deadpan vocal delivery, but all that swagger can't conceal the band's congenial and increasingly introspective nature.</p>
<p>With the album's opening track, the Soft Pack become maybe the 10,000th rock band to write a song called ""C'mon"", but coming from laconic frontman Matt Lamkin, the song is less about inciting action (note the lack of exclamation point), than an eye-rolling dismissal of the trendspotting and premature hype that consumes (and kills) so many bands: ""Don't have the look, don't have the name/ Don't have the walk, don't want to talk, don't act the same/ Now your town could be the next big thing."" Now, San Diego isn't the first city on anyone's lips when people talk about A&amp;R destinations, but the Soft Pack are probably old enough to have witnessed early-90s scene-leaders Rocket from the Crypt, Drive Like Jehu, and Three Mile Pilot trade up to major labels only to get dropped or disband. And following their own hype-magnet experiences at prior CMJ and SXSW appearances-- not to mention a relocation to the music-biz capital of Los Angeles-- the Soft Pack now sound more cautious than caustic. Amid the playful call-and-response choruses and locomotive rhythms, we hear sincere declarations of independence (""Answer to Yourself""), rejections of romance (""Down on Loving""), and warnings against material self-indulgence (""More or Less"").</p>

And though Lamkin's monotone voice is not the most expressive instrument-- it barely wavers whether the occasion calls for a Monks-style organ vamp (""Move Along"") or a prom-night embrace (""Mexico"")-- each album side gradually ratchets up the tension and releases it through a raucous rave-up (""Pull Out"" on side A,  ""Parasites"" on side B) that successfully bridges the Soft Pack's <i>Nuggets</i>-schooled ethos with the modern-day discord of San Diegan patron saints Hot Snakes. So while the Soft Pack may exhibit more grace and decorum these days, those seething send-off tracks are proof the band has gone soft in name only.</p></div>"|13892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13892-the-soft-pack/|7.1|Stuart Berman

An obscure sample ushers in ""Chittlins &amp; Pepsi"", a stick-to-your guts blend of flashy soul and food-based free association. Meanwhile, pot ramble ""Cheeba Cheeba"" is anchored by resonant strings and a fluid bass line inhaled and exhaled between minimal beats. It may sound like Doom's M.O.-- tracks seemingly teed-up for the masked marauder. But L.A. hip-hop collective Strong Arm Steady provides the lyrics here. Once the home of auto repair hypeman Xzibit, the crew now stands as another entry in a long line of Beat Konducta collaborators.</p>
<p>Stones Throw has been widening its circle of L.A. connections recently, including putting out the acclaimed Dâm-Funk album and reissuing Arabian Prince tracks. This post-Death Row SoCal crew-- which has been reduced to core members Krondon, Phil Da Agony, and San Diegan Mitchy Slick for this release-- has seen its underground profile rise slightly this past year due to a middling Clinton Sparks mixtape and a forthcoming album on Talib Kweli's Blacksmith label.</p>
<p>The group's experience working the L.A. scene and slinging mixtapes shows on <i>In Search of Stoney Jackson</i>. In the enviable position of getting a slate of Otis Jackson, Jr. beats to work with, Strong Arm Steady do raise their game, but rarely rise above workmanlike wordplay. They provide vocal diversity but never overshadow or own a track, only accenting different aspects of Madlib's work. Phil Da Agony's curt, taunting flow, filled with bent phrases, darts around between measures. Albino rapper Krondon has a deeper, rounded tone, which plays well on the chorus of the dark ""New Love"", and Mitchy Slick sounds passable on the few tracks he appears on. Along with a roster of collaborators, like Planet Asia and Stones Throw standbys like Oh No and Guilty Simpson, it adds up to a set of solid yet often unremarkable lyrics staking a comfortable perch atop another stellar Madlib production workout.</p>
<p>Filled with funky vocal samples, discursive monologues and the inevitable dry coughs, the music is the centerpiece and bears Madlib's signature hazy melodies and blunted edges. But there's a muscular feel to many of the tracks, meaty beats anyone would be happy to rap over. ""Best of Times"", featuring Phonte on the chorus doing his best John Legend, is a slow-rolling, soulful piece built on a solid foundation, a warm bass lick and almost metronomic four-beat rhythm. ""Pressure"" bumps with oscillating synths and a stiff, crisp beat. ""Questions"", which starts out sounding like a washed-out TV theme and then pivots on a big, bulbous bassline, is simple but effective, accented with subtle vibe hits and a single wiry guitar chord. For all Madlib's eclecticism and supposedly short attention span, his work here sounds focused and sharp. The beats aren't wasted here by any means, but a different crew could have brought out even more potential.</p></div>"|13868.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13868-in-search-of-stoney-jackson/|7.1|Patrick Sisson

Not even a little. So when I listen to gospel music, there is naturally a gap between me and the people singing. But to be irreligious is not necessarily to be without a spiritual side, and music has always been my connection to it. I don't pretend to have answers-- for all I know,  the intangible effects of music could be 100% chemistry or the handiwork of an involved god-- but I do know that music has strange powers. It can lift you up, if not to Heaven, then at least out of a funk; it can access places and emotions that you don't get to in daily conversation, regardless of what the singer is actually saying. It can be hopeful without saying anything hopeful, sad without saying anything sad, joyful without saying a word.</p>
<p>More tangibly, music can activate the parts of the brain that govern movement, and here's where it gets really easy to ignore my differences with other belief systems and just get into someone else's groove. This compilation, a collection of funk and soul-influenced gospel music recorded between 1970 and 1985, is Numero Group's second foray into this field, and it's easily as good as the first. It's also funky enough immediately to grab any listener with a taste for rhythm-- even if you don't roll with Jesus, there's a good chance you can enjoy the storytelling and feel the sheer passion these performers put into their music. Right in the middle of the compilation, the Victory Travelers deliver a screaming, devotional blast called ""I Know I've Been Changed"" that hinges on a key couplet heard in numerous funky gospel tunes: ""I dropped in the water, the water was cold/ Chilled my body but not my soul."" It's a powerful image and says a lot about the singer's faith without sanctimony.</p>
<p>The body/soul divide is less clear-cut on the Golden Echoes' ""Packing a Grip"". A grip is of course a handbag-- what is she putting in that bag that she'll need in Heaven? Whatever it is, it's funky. Ada Richards is somewhat sly on her wailing number, ""I'm Drunk and Real High (In the Spirit of the Lord)""-- replace the word ""judge"" with ""love"" in the first verse and you'd have a pretty dirty song on your hands. Likewise, the Sensational Five Singing Sons deliver a social protest song clothed in religious vestments on ""Coming on Strong, Staying Along"", referring to their faith as ""a new gun"" in the city. The call to ""rise up"" in Andrew Wartts &amp; the Gospel Storytellers' ""Peter and John"" also directly echoes the conscious soul of the 60s and 70s, albeit in a different context-- it could be that the band was subtly sending one message to the faithful and another to the ghetto. ""Peter and John"" is a unique and highly entertaining casting of a story from the Book of Acts into a boiling funk setting that veers between start-stop passages and slinky J.B.'s-inspired street funk with palm-muted guitar and a light touch on the snare drum.</p>
<p>These groups came from all over the eastern half of the U.S., and the array of styles included here is practically a cross-section of American soul and funk in the 70s. The Inspirational Gospel Singers may have recorded in Rochester, New York, but their cover of the Impressions' ""Same Thing It Took"" is a slow, sublime slice of smoky Southern soul that sounds like it could have been cut at Muscle Shoals. Lucy Rodgers' ""Pray a Little Longer"" burns on a sharp Clavinet groove; ""I Know Him"", by the Holy Disciples of Chicago, is loose-limbed and elastic; and Brother Samuel Cheatham brings the blues on ""Troubles of the World"", a burning, anguished crawl that sets its sights on a better place, while the Hammond organ screams in the background.</p>
<p>The set is bookended by two massive tracks that bring in full choirs to spread The Word. There's a power to the simple sound of that many people all working toward the same end, giving it all they've got (and sometimes singing a bit sharp in all the excitement), and it's one more reason you don't have to believe what they believe to love the music they made. Music's place in our society is always changing, but it's still the most viscerally powerful medium of expression we've ever devised, and beyond its message, this is music that reaches into those remote places that spark emotional-- and physical-- responses.</p></div>"|13811.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13811-good-god-born-again-funk/|8.0|Joe Tangari

In a press release accompanying <i>144 Pulsations of Light</i>, his debut LP for Kranky, Gray explains his intent behind the record was to ""apply trance-inducing sonic effects to drone-ambient music... to produce an introspective sonic environment conducive to self-healing work and voyaging into new states of awareness."" That's a pretty ambitious claim to make about one's own music, and whether or not you buy into Gray's ideas about the medicinal qualities of his album-- frankly I don't feel any more enlightened or balanced after hearing it-- there's no doubt that Ethernet sits nicely alongside the meditative sounds of artists such as Gas, Boards of Canada, and Stars of the Lid.</p>
<p>Rather than expanding upon one type of drone or ambient, Gray looks to synthesize a few of the more pleasant strains of both genres-- working in particular towards blending Wolfgang Voigt's muted propulsion with the airier groans of avant-pop groups like Talk Talk. It's not the most imaginative approach-- similar work has been done by contemporaries White Rainbow and the Fun Years, among others-- but if you have a sweet spot for this sort of thing, chances are you'll find stretches of the album to enjoy. Though it doesn't always operate within this one style, <i>144 Pulsations of Light</i> works best when aiming directly for an ambient techno/light drone fusion. On swirling opener ""Majestic"" and the lengthy ""Vaporous"", which worms distorted synths through depth-charge bass pulses, the album circles in on something close to trance-like.</p>
<p>Gray is wise to play with atmosphere and switch gears throughout the record, though some of his tonal shifts work better than others. ""Summer Insects"" and ""Kansai"" are two of the more successful, the former using crackling vinyl pops and field recordings to sketch out an agrarian landscape. These natural textures, which bring to mind some of Bibio's current work, play nicely off the dronier pieces here, but a few of the album's later tracks tend to stall out with less complexity. ""Seaside"" looks to create a coastal vibe by riding a gentle, repetitive synth pattern, but there isn't enough movement or dynamism to elevate it beyond a pleasant instrumental. Any such detour into background music can be dangerous on an album like this, and Gray does a good job of mostly avoiding them, but a few missteps ultimately keep the record from achieving its intended goal of full-on ethereality.</p></div>"|13737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13737-144-pulsations-of-light/|6.7|Joe Colly

""Everybody say they just do it, well, I just don't,"" claims Lil Wayne on <i>Rebirth</i>, his unlikely, unqualified, and quite unbelievable rock album. And he's speaking the truth: This album is not the logical official follow-up to 2008's best-selling <i>Tha Carter III</i>. At all. In any way. For that, he deserves credit. Considering Wayne is a man whose artistic aims apparently involve 1) Collecting oil-tycoon cash, 2) Having sex with several women at once, and 3) Concocting the world's finest excrement-related rhymes, <i>Rebirth</i> is most definitely a flop, terribly unsexy, and contains surprisingly few shit jokes. Wayne is playing against type here. ""When I play sick, I'm Jordan with the flu,"" he boasts on the album, referring to Jordan's classic game against the Jazz. And in general, that's true; but here Wayne is like Mike with pneumonia and a broken leg... playing baseball.</p>
<p>In the mid 1980s, Run-D.M.C. used distorted guitars and stadium-rock drums to help break hip-hop into the mainstream. Now, one of the world's biggest rappers is using the same tools to make a niche record only a diehard could truly love. That flip says as much about hip-hop's current state of evolution (shaky) as it does about Lil Wayne's current commercial predicament. Although his recent mixtape was dubbed <i>No Ceilings</i>, the pressure of success and the idea that he'll never top the million-in-a-week phenomenon that was <i>Tha Carter III </i>is naturally weighing on Wayne. He may never have a single as big as ""Lollipop"" or reach the level of universal relevancy to warrant another prime time interview with Katie Couric. He seems to realize this on <i>Rebirth</i>.</p>
<p>""Call me crazy, I've been called worse/ It's like I have it all, but what's it all worth?"" asks Wayne on ""Paradice"", a Miltonian epic about the trappings of super stardom that aims for Axl Rose, <i>Use Your Illusion</i>-style heights. The closest he comes to an answer to that question is on ""Drop the World"", where he combats paranoia by threatening to ""pick the world up and drop it on your fuckin' head!"" It's a hilarious image that would serve as an incredible exaggerated parody of Linkin Park angst if the song wasn't dead serious-- a fact confirmed by a martyr-me guest shot from Eminem, who himself <i>still</i> sounds like he's coming to grips with the fact that he'll never be as famous as he once was.</p>
<p>""Drop the World"" also contains another key lyric from Wayne: ""The spot get smaller and I get bigger/ Tryin' to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga."" The lines hint at the notion of <i>Rebirth</i> being something of a cop-out, i.e., if he can't top himself, he's just going to scratch away everything that makes him great. So instead of rapping we get gurgled Auto-Tune chirps and squeals that often nullify his one-in-a-billion elastic croak. Instead of next-level clever punchlines-inside-of-punchlines we get pure high-school inanity or swear parades deserving of a soapy mouthwash. According to Wayne, rock music combines the coked-out idiocy of Sunset Strip hair metal with the processed rage of Bizkit-ed headbanging. Understandably, the combination can be abhorrent. The choice to cannibalize two of rock's least respectable styles against each other makes zero sense, and is especially surprising from someone obsessed with André 3000, whose similarly risky 2003 genre switch up, <i>The Love Below</i>, wisely borrowed from Prince more than Evanescence.</p>
<p>But even with <i>Rebirth</i>'s crushing lows-- and Wayne's imminent jail sentence thanks to a guilty plea on attempted gun possession charges-- there is little reason to doubt the 27-year-old's future as an enterprising, Grammy-highlighting superstar of the most esteemed set. ""Confidence is the stain they can't wipe off,"" he says on the record, and he's right. A big part of his magnetism relies on unpredictability and his willingness to reside in a personal realm where trends, gimmicks, and gravity are of little concern. In that more ideological and less critical mindset, <i>Rebirth</i> is an oddball win. His still-impressive productivity rate also cushions the blow-- thanks to <i>No Ceilings</i>, we know the guy's rapping abilities are still sharp. And, on the same day <i>Rebirth</i> saw release, Wayne also put out a brand new non-album cut called ""Fuck Today"" that combines rap and rock with more aplomb than anything on the new LP. The track is diabolical and political, recalling Ice Cube in his early-90s prime. And it makes you think the proposition of a <i>Rebirth II</i> might not be so awful. I mean, it could be better.</p></div>"|13116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13116-rebirth/|4.5|Ryan Dombal

Well, they sound like a mix of popular New York sounds from the last decade-- like the precise midpoint between the Strokes and LCD Soundsystem. Now, you could of course play ""spot the influence"" as easily with the Strokes and LCD Soundsystem, but they've both been so great at reshuffling the deck, it's hard to mind when the same card keeps coming up. Hockey, too, are pretty unabashed about whose notes they're cribbing from, but unlike so many self-serious Strokesalikes and party-starting mini-Murphys, on their debut LP, <i>Mind Chaos</i>, Hockey seem to be having a little fun with it, keeping things casual, cracking jokes at their own expense. You'd be surprised how well it works.</p>
<p>You need only make it to the chorus of opener ""Too Fake"" to see what I mean; it thumps and stutters to a start not unlike one of the talkier LCD tunes, ""North American Scum"" or ""Losing My Edge"", before sliding into a new wavey chorus that suggests the more sumptuous-sounding stuff from the Strokes' <i>First Impressions of Earth</i>. There's just no getting around it; save a little <i>It's Blitz!</i>-style disco sheen and some Hamilton Leithauser howl on a few of the vocals, <i>Mind Chaos</i>' first two-thirds keeps things chatty but clear-cut, precise but playful. Some tunes lean further to one side or the other, but until things get weird around ""Four Holy Photos"", you'd be forgiven if you thought iTunes was getting cute and snuck ""12:51"" over <i>45:33</i>.</p>
<p>Maybe it's critic-proofing (it's certainly critic-baiting), but Ben Grubin's figured a way around any accusation that he's being derivative: He just comes right out and says it himself. The first song's called ""Too Fake"" (and even <i>this</i> approach is derivative, specifically of MGMT's bow ""Time to Pretend""). But it's the knockout single ""Song Away"" that finds Rubin at his most egregiously self-effacing; ""I stole my personality from an anonymous source,"" he claims on his ""truthful song over an 80s groove,"" and then, talking about himself, he's ""ahead of his time... if only he could prove it."" All through the album, aside after amusing aside, Rubin paints himself as a clever kid with a knack for synthesizing smart ideas (mostly other people's) into something enjoyably breezy, well aware neither he nor his band are reinventing the wheel. It can feel impersonal and winking, having this guy defining himself against things rather than just expressing himself. But given the cloud of mope that surrounded so many Strokes acolytes in the earlier part of the last decade and the not-as-incisive-as-they-think stance of most post-LCD lyrics-as-commentary, Rubin's just seems to be having a laugh, and when he says stuff like, ""everybody's making dance music, true, but we started in 2002,"" on his debut record, you may well chuckle along.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this would work without hooks to hang all the chatter on, and Hockey have quite a few; the blushing ""Work"" has shades of Phoenix at their more Strokes-like; ""Curse This City"" smacks of post-fame the Rapture; and ""3AM Spanish"" comes across like Blondie at their most in tune to hip-hop. It gets a bit dicey around gentle honky-talker ""Four Holy Photos""; from then on, the sharp aesthetic on loan gets turned in, and we're treated to a mixed bag of not-quite-there ideas that pales next to the bright lights of the big city chatterpop that precedes it. It feels like Hockey struggling a bit to carve out their own sound, as the songs around the back end do get more eclectic, a bit squigglier, a little harder to triangulate, cut with less humor, and a lot less good for it. They oughtn't have felt the need; the vintage threads of their forebears fit them so much better.</p></div>"|13897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13897-mind-chaos/|6.7|Paul Thompson

It's not a sound that takes a lot of risks, and thus, trying to figure out what constitutes <i>great </i>Album Leaf and merely <i>more </i>Album Leaf is splitting some incredibly thin hairs.</p>
<p>Sure, most of <i>Chorus </i>is pretty, but it's only that: Between the glistening guitars, cymbal washes, sighing strings, and electric piano, the beauty LaValle conjures is effortless but ultimately less impressive for not having any sort of contrast. ""Summer Fog"" and ""Blank Pages"" swell and contract with lava-lamp hypnosis, but offer little in the way of resolution. The disembodied children's voices on ""Perro"" and  mulched-up drum filtering of ""Within Dreams"" can give you a quick Boards of Canada fix, but you mostly wish it was undercut by some kind of <i>Geogaddi </i>menace.</p>
<p>In complete defiance of its title, what's noticeably missing are choruses, stories, and people telling them. It's about the same ratio of vocals/instruments as albums past, but they're less frontloaded in the sequencing. As far as curveballs, you have to take what you can get. The Dave Fridmann-styled drums of ""Stand Still"" brush up against a guitar figure reminiscent of Jimmy Eat World's ""Polaris"", but it builds with the grace and fluidity of Explosions in the Sky to <i>Chorus' </i>most enthralling climax.  ""Until the Last"" is the most interesting composition here, not so much due to texture as that it's written in 5/4. With its booming low-end and trash-can drum kit, ""We Are"" is the closest thing the Album Leaf have done to typical power-trio rock, but as rock music goes, it doesn't do much to display LaValle as an underutilized melodicist.</p>
<p>So I guess the question becomes whether you're willing to accept <i>A Chorus of Storytellers </i>on its own terms-- the Album Leaf should never have to apologize for not rocking enough. LaValle never asks too much of the listener, and if you're into that sort of thing, <i>Chorus </i>is a fine entry into their already fine catalog.</p></div>"|13901.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13901-a-chorus-of-storytellers/|6.3|Ian Cohen

But that's not a value judgment, it's a confession and disclaimer-- and, effectively, a statement of fact that you can verify by trudging through some of the prose inspired by <i>Sadly, the Future Is No Longer What It Once Was</i>.</p>
<p>All the high-minded talk about <i>Sadly</i> is strange given how intuitive the music sounds. Where Kirby's first records (as V/VM) were little nightmares of aggression and pure provocation, <i>Sadly</i>-- three discs of anodyne melodies wandering through static and echo-- is all mood, composition, and performance. It might be dull music, but it's definitely music, which constitutes a radical change for a guy who once released a record filled with the sound of pigs feeding.</p>
<p>The music on <i>Sadly</i> isn't ambient, or at least not how I think of ambient music. It doesn't meet the world halfway. Instead, it's a little like Charlie Brown's personal raincloud: all-encompassing, portable melancholy. Its monotony is part of the point, I think, and its consistency is one of its virtues-- sometimes I forget that it's on until it's over and I'm sitting in my room feeling lightly bummed out about something I can't describe. Kirby is situating himself in a continuum with composers like Erik Satie and Harold Budd, or groups like Deathprod-- music whose finished state sounds half-erased and feint. The conceptual thrust-- if you accept conceptual thrusts-- is a kind of faded-photograph feeling, an effort to represent loss through degraded and scraped-away sounds. The concept is ethereal, and the consistency of the product's effect can't really be guaranteed-- one person's hollowed-out futurescapes of ruined beauty is another person's bore.</p>
<p>Kirby's sound has mellowed, but his approach-- three discs, four hours, little variation-- is still extreme. While I hear the dark undercurrents in his music, I'm not sure he's any more interested in the evocation of emotion than other abstract instrumental composers, nor am I presumptuous enough to say whether or not he's better at evoking them. <i>Sadly</i> is a record I admire more often and more deeply than I feel it, but I definitely admire it-- mostly because Kirby makes music of stasis that doesn't announce itself as much as it seeps. It never grates and it never bores. At worst-- or, at best, depending on which side of the concept you're on-- Kirby's music just <i>vanishes</i>.</p></div>"|13891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13891-sadly-the-future-is-no-longer-what-it-once-was/|6.8|Mike Powell

And yes, the personnel is the same as on the band's self-titled 2006 album, but here the group's general strategy seems to have shifted drastically. Gone, for the most part, are the debut's predominantly acoustic instruments and eclectic, Pentangle-like folk-rock. Instead, <i>Shape of the Shape</i> draws upon a rather weird combination of cosmic country and space-age Moog drones, resulting in a sound that is considerably more distinctive and almost wholly unexpected.</p>
<p>After some time spent with <i>Shape of the Shape</i>, of course, traces of continuity do reveal themselves. The songs here are still largely centered on the dusky alto of French-born Hélène Gautier, and several tracks, such as the opening ""Say Donny Say"", have a basic structure that echoes English and Appalachian folk tradition. Beyond that, however, Starless &amp; Bible Black take virtually every opportunity to change things up. On the debut, Raz Ullah's vintage electronics were used largely to add background accent and effect; here they are much more integrated into the proceedings, with his varied drones providing essential foundational support beneath Gautier's vocals and Peter Phillipson's bracing Telecaster.</p>
<p>If Starless &amp; Bible Black were not actually British, it would be fairly easy to classify several tracks here as Americana and be done with it. (The album was recorded in a village hall in the Snowdonian mountains, so apparently it comes by its rustic, panoramic vision honestly.) Following a brief electronic introduction that seems delivered straight from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, the fractured country-rock ""Say Donny Say"" crackles like a broken telegraph line, while the drolly-titled ""Country Heir"" allows Gautier a chance at lovesick balladry. On these simpler tracks, Ullah's vintage synths often occupy the same tonal space that would traditionally belong to pedal steel, a subtle variation that enables the songs to sound at once familiar and yet vaguely alien.</p>
<p>As the album progresses, however, these familiar landmarks become increasingly harder to spot, especially on ""Les Furies"", the album's nine-minute space/prog/country centerpiece. It's a howling whirl of Moog and country guitar, jazzy interludes, and Gautier's layered, Cocteau Twins-like vocals: suffice it to say that this is a daring piece, and it ends appropriately enough with the sound of incredulous laughter in the studio. For the occasion, Ullah really puts his full electronic arsenal to use, recalling some of Garth Hudson's crazier ""Chest Fever"" showcases with the Band, although with a decidedly artier, more European bent.</p>
<p>Astonishing as ""Les Furies"" is, its general strangeness does risk making the rest of the album seem rather too tame in comparison. Fortunately, Starless &amp; Bible Black have the songwriting chops to hold the listener's interest even when their sonics are more earthbound. Gautier's lyrics are elusive, in part due to the way she slips almost invisibly between French and English, but the melodic hooks on songs such as ""Your Majesty Man"" and the wistful ""Year of Dalmatians"" are substantial enough to ensure return visits. And the group even sees fit to throw in the folk-jazz instrumental ""Popty Ping"", almost as a reminder that they can still expertly go the Pentangle route when the mood suits them, although as this album illustrates they would usually prefer a path of their own invention.</p></div>"|13687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13687-shape-of-the-shape/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

Its charms were subtle; occasionally a shimmering melodic flourish or a shade in singer Tim Smith's earthy throat would float into the mix and really knock you out. Though it dragged a touch toward the end and sometimes felt a bit self-satisfied in its smoothness, it was a pleaser and-- because it moved them light years beyond the gooey Grandaddy-lite of their debut without much apparent effort-- seemed to promise good stuff on the bound.</p>
<p>At long last, we have <i>The Courage of Others</i>, reportedly the product of the perennial touring band's newfound obsession with the British folk of Pentangle, Fairport Convention, and the like. It was, they've said in interviews, an attempt to distance themselves from <i>Van Occupanther</i>, which is understandable; after three and a half years of touring behind a record, ripping it up and starting again is what you do. But there were shades of the kind of British folk they're talking about all over <i>Van Occupanther</i>; fewer flutes, maybe, but the same sort of compositional fussiness and hushed, dulcet tones matched with rich harmonies. And they were, virtually without exception, woven together into far better songs. <i>Van Occupanther</i>, low-key though it was, kept the arrangements frothy and dynamic, the tunes multifaceted and sweeping, the playing precise but limber. <i>The Courage of Others</i> is a step down on songcraft, atmosphere, and apparently, even self-awareness: If you're trying to distance yourself from something, you wouldn't plunge headfirst into it, would you?</p>
<p>Without calling too much attention to it, <i>Van Occupanter</i> swayed and squirmed, and as a result of this constant shift, songs rarely ended up where they started. Save the occasional flittery fingerpicked intro, the tunes on <i>The Courage of Others</i> take up the same languid, near-narcotic pace, and they stick with it. <i>Van Occupanther</i>'s best songs seemed to match up a couple of disparate ideas and found ways to slowly lead one toward the other-- the prim verse melody of ""We Gathered in Spring"" didn't seem an easy fit with that song's gooey choral descent, but they patiently bring the two together, and the resulting payoff lent the lovely but lethargic tune some drama. There are no stakes like that with the <i>Courage</i> songs, no sense that things might fly off into uncharted territory. Theirs is an exceptionally polite reading of these British folk constructions, and as nearly every tune tumbles through its ornate intro, its hushed first verse, and the minor lift of its chorus, your patience wears as thin as the tunes.</p>
<p>It's no help that Smith, never the most expressive vocalist, sounds at times uninterested; his vocal melodies have gotten simpler to match the music, but he himself seems detached, delivering every line with the kind of passion you might reserve for courtesy calls. Lyrically, <i>Van Occupanther</i>'s man-out-of-time treatments of honor and family were admirably antiquated, but while <i>Courage</i> picks up <i>Occupanther</i>'s naturalistic bent, it lacks a thesis to tie it all together. That, I suppose, it leaves to the all-too-similar execution. With precious little exception, these songs are just so wispy, and the band's treatment of them so delicate, it turns <i>Courage</i> into a museum piece, stuffy, bloodless. A lot of those Britfolk cats were really hot players and there's not even that to hold onto; every performance is a few notches above adequate, but there's no bite to any of it, no intensity, precious little conveyance of emotion. I wish there were a single great song, one shining moment to point to as a beacon of hope for what's to come for these guys, but <i>Courage</i> just feels so monochromatic, so flatlined, even the tiniest signs of life have no power to resuscitate.</p></div>"|13885.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13885-the-courage-of-others/|3.6|Paul Thompson

Given Malachai's apparent fondness for turn-of-the-1970s British music-- Badfinger, schmaltzy AM-radio pop, or the grainy reggae imported by England's Jamaican immigrant class-- this lyric from the masked Bristol duo's debut could very well just be a colloquial reference to traffic congestion on UK motorways. But the manic, cut-and-paste aesthetic that members Gee Ealey and Scott Hendy exhibit on <i>Ugly Side of Love</i> also suggests that the lyric could be a rejection of the (re)cyclical nature of rock, what with the 80s post-punk resurrection that informed so much indie over the past decade now yielding to 90s alt-rock revivalism, like clockwork. For a band like Malachai, who are more interested in toying with unfashionable pop arcana than conforming to hipster-baiting trends, it's hard to tell what's more wearisome: the prevalence of genre-centric nostalgia, or the fact that it recurs at such predictable intervals.</p>
<p>Now, Malachai-- previously Malakai, before a namesake California rapper claimed legal dibs on the ""k""-- are hardly ones to present themselves as futurists; <i>Ugly Side of Love</i> seems deliberately designed to evoke the dusty-grooved ambience and freewheeling feel of a UK pirate-radio broadcast from 1973. But unlike so many Britpop bands who tried to recapture the spirit of a bygone era by writing and performing songs that sound like their favorite albums, Ealey and Hendy simply take the posturing out of the equation altogether and just sample them wholesale. <i>Ugly Side of Love</i> is thus a rock album pieced together by crate-diggers, one that's eager to undercut notions of authenticity to emphasize its own pastiche quality with obvious samples and abrupt edits.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the liners list only two sample sources, one of them 70s-era UK crooner Daniel Boone's ""Sad and Lonely Lady"" being repurposed on the boogie-rock stomper ""Snowflake"". But there's clearly so much more where that came from: ""How Long"" loops the Guess Who's 1970 single ""Hand Me Down World"" into a piece of hand-me-down rock that deviously cuts its sample off mid-guitar-lick; ""Shitkicker"" revs up on a riff reminiscent of Heart's Camaro classic ""Barracuda"" before sling-shooting back on a cavalcade of incessant handclaps, Gee's double-tracked harmonies and, of course, more cowbell; the reggafied rumble ""Warriors"" not only name-checks the 1979 gang flick, it uses the film's climactic, bottle-plinking ""come and out play"" taunt as its hook. But <i>Ugly Side of Love</i> is more than just the sum of Malachai's dollar-bin finds. In Gee, they boast an elastic vocalist who perfectly embodies band's mischievous approach, yielding performances that are by turns sinister (the mutant acid-rocker ""Blackbird"") and heart-on-sleeve sweet (the bubblegum-soul serenade ""Another Sun""). Ironically, it's his least affected performance that feels the most forced, with the clap-along campfire jam ""Moonsurfin'"" coming off like a commercial jingle (""Now it's here/ Grab a beer!"") pitched at trustafarians.</p>
<p>Considering Malachai's Bristol roots and flair for sample-based recontextualization, it's no surprise that the duo has found a champion/mentor in Portishead's Geoff Barrow, who first issued the album last year on his Invada imprint and served as its ""executive producer."" Indeed, the sole Barrow co-write, ""Only For You"", carries heavy, cannabis-infused whiffs of Portishead's film-noir funk. But Malachai are actually most reminiscent of Clinic, another shadowy outfit who debuted on Domino some 10 years ago. The latter tapped more canonical cult-rock sources like the Velvet Underground and Sparks, but exhibited a similar adeptness at processing and repackaging disparate reference points into seemingly familiar yet freakishly alien two-minute pop songs. And if, like Clinic, Malachai are too respectful of their retro sources to fully veer off the rock'n'roll roundabout, <i>Ugly Side of Love</i> nonetheless revisits a moment in British pop history through a series of surprising U-turns and thrillingly illegal lane changes.</p></div>"|13867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13867-ugly-side-of-love/|7.5|Stuart Berman

Biguine, Afro and Latin Sounds From The French Caribbean, 1963-1974|0.0|Various Artists|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Soundway']|2010-02-03 00:00:00|2009|2016-06-11 18:41:53.522764|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".3r16yyld6o.1.6:0.1.0.$13538/=1$13538.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>It's fair to say that Western interest in African popular music from the 1960s and 70s has exploded over last 10 years. During this stretch, there's been an onslaught of incredible reissues and compilations, mostly from British and European labels. If there's anything this frenzy of rediscovery has shown, it's that we've only scratched the surface of the incredible amount of music that came out of that continent in those two decades. Perhaps because there's so much great music to explore in Africa, there's been less reissue attention paid to the musically and culturally related styles of the Latin Caribbean. But it seems to be happening in earnest now after a bit of a lag.</p>
<p>Britain-based Soundway helped spearhead our dive into vintage Afro styles with its incredible series of Ghanaian and Nigerian funk, rock, soul, highlife, and disco compilations. A few years ago, it started hitting tropical sounds in the Western Hemisphere with stops in Colombia and Panama (the Panama! series picked up again last year with two more excellent volumes). <i>Tumbélé!</i> takes the label to the French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe for a deep plunge into the relatively unexplored waters of the popular sounds of the Lesser Antilles. The disc steers mostly away from heavily funk- and soul-influenced sounds in favor of styles with more audible links to the biguine, bélé, and gwo ka music of the islands.</p>
<p>Gwo ka and bélé are traditional rural styles of Guadeloupe and Martinique, respectively, built around drumming and vocal call-and-response. Both reflect the islands' history with slavery and forced migration, while biguine is more urbane, tracing its roots to a 19th Century synthesis of bélé rhythms and brass-led polka by black musicians in Martinique. Those elements lie at the heart of all the music included on this compilation, and over the course of its 20 tracks, you'll hear them cross-pollinated with Congolese rumba, Cuban guaguanco, Haitian compas, Trinidadian calypso, American and French hot jazz, Puerto Rican, plena and even a bit of proto-boogaloo, often to thrilling effect.</p>
<p>The compilation launches with an abrupt cold start that quickly turns very, very hot. The rhythm section and horns all drop in together on the very first beat of Barel Coppet et Mister Lof's ""Jeunesse Vauclin"", the sax and clarinet weaving tightly in unison through the bounding rhythms and hand drums. The song is sweet and naturally funky, a description that could apply to almost all these selections. Some of the outside influences on French Antillean music of the period can be heard directly on inspired selections from Haitian and Congolese acts. Haiti's Les Loups Noirs recorded the appropriately propulsive ""Jet Biguine"", with its psyched-out surf guitar leads, during a stay in Martinique, and it's emblematic of the Haitian small group sounds that influenced a move away from larger ensembles in the islands during the 60s. Congo's Ry-Co Jazz spent four years in Martinique and Guadeloupe, bringing the Caribbean influence that birthed Central African rumba full circle to create the tumbélé style-- their ""Dima Bolane"" is crazily percussive, balancing frenzied drumming against a slow bass figure and sweetly melodic harmony vocals and sax.</p>
<p>There's more wild drumming where that came from, too. Anzala, Dolor, Velo offer fairly straight gwo ka on ""Ti Fi La Ou Te Madam'"", chanting over hard percussion-- their only concession to urban sounds is a fierce saxophone part that twists around the vocals with amazing dexterity. L'Orchestre Jeunesse de Paul-Emile Haliar cast traditional drums in a more modern context on 1963's ""La Vie Critique"", splattering a sax and clarinet-driven biguine with strong jazz overtones with sonorous outbursts of heavy timbale. Jazz is far more up front on the track by Orchestre Combo Zombi, which sounds like it could have knocked an audience at the Paris Hot Club flat on its back. The piano solo is astonishing. Other stylistic combinations are farther out. Les Kings are overt about it: they cover a Puerto Rican bomba track pretty faithfully, but one of their trumpet players cleverly interpolates Antonio Machin's Cuban classic ""El Manisero"" as if to telegraph the band's diverse inspirations.</p>
<p>The Caribbean has long been and likely long will be a melting pot. Martinique and Guadeloupe's direct ties to Europe and Africa (via France) and proximity to other Caribbean cultures and sounds made the islands an ideal crucible for imaginative combinations of styles old and new. You can hear the crosscurrents in the electric guitar parts, clarinet solos, intense drumming, and diverse vocal styles on this disc. As we in Europe and North America acclimate to the music of the tropics we once ignored, it makes sense that we'll gradually move away from the comfortable styles with direct rock, soul, and funk influences to find something more purely representative of the places and times we tour through old records. This compilation is a great starting point.</p></div>"|13538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13538-tumbele-biguine-afro-and-latin-sounds-from-the-french-caribbean-1963-1974/|8.5|Joe Tangari

He has previously recorded several albums with his long-running project Currituck County, and as a sideman-for-hire he has performed with an impressive array of talents, including Joanna Newsom, Vashti Bunyan, and Antony and the Johnsons. Yet for better or worse the gig that seems to have most impacted Barker is touring and recording with Andy Cabic in Vetiver, and <i>You &amp; Me</i> almost seamlessly continues Vetiver's trail through the rustic backwoods of dazed Americana.</p>
<p>One doesn't build a discography like Barker's without being awfully good at playing an instrument, and <i>You &amp; Me</i> is rife with evidence of Barker's expressive skill on both electric and acoustic guitar. His vocal style is clean and laid-back, recalling Cabic certainly, but also with tints of a more grounded Sam Beam or even a young Jackson Browne. Produced by Vetiver vet Thom Monahan and featuring contributions from such cohorts as Newsom (on keyboards), Wilco's Pat Sansone, and drummer Otto Hauser, the album exudes an undeniable sense of warmth and general bonhomie.</p>
<p>The hitch, however, is that Barker's likable presence is not enough to rescue some of these songs, and as a result <i>You &amp; Me</i> soon becomes an album that listeners may find themselves wanting to like more than they actually do. Considerably more song-oriented than Barker's abstract, improvisational work in Currituck County, the album suffers from too many songs that cross the thin line separating the loose and carefree from the downright sluggish. At times Barker can seem so lackadaisical that his lyrics sound as though they might have been made up on the spot.</p>
<p>Yet-- typical of an album produced by Monahan-- <i>You &amp; Me</i> is impeccably recorded and filled with subtle, striking instrumental details. The album's press materials reference the Grateful Dead, a comparison that is neither entirely accurate nor especially useful, but, as with the Dead's studio albums, Barker and his group use the simple tunes of ""Amber"" and ""Mountain &amp; Bear"" as a handy excuse for some tasteful jamming. A skillful finger-picker, Barker sticks predominantly with electric guitar here, although he does crack out the acoustic on the sprightly country folk of ""My Lady"" and on the riveting closer ""Bless You on Your Way"" which is further enlivened by a string section.</p>
<p>Nearly every song here falls into the easy ambling gait that should be familiar to anyone who has heard Vetiver, a fact that Barker further reinforces by titling one track ""Walking Along"". (And you get bonus credit if you've also guessed that he's ""walking along and singing my song."") This uniformity of tone and tempo understandably causes <i>You &amp; Me</i> to wilt through its middle stretches despite its relatively brief running time. The downloadable version of the album does include three extra tracks, one of which, ""Ten Toes to Sister Sky"" seems more immediately dynamic and engaging than just about anything on the album proper, and hopefully offers a suggestion that perhaps Barker's future travels will investigate territory that's a bit more rugged.</p></div>"|13890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13890-you-me/|5.9|Matthew Murphy

And yet... the Universal Records logo on back and a bevy of Swedish Grammys on Anna Ternheim's mantle can be just as misleading. Sweden-born NYC transplant Ternheim tows a fine line, one that leaves her at a crossroads between the cult notoriety of the underground and the expertly branded saturation of the mainstream. Depending on who's handling her, she could just as well be a scrappier, moodier Sarah McLachlan or the sophisticated big sister to whichever indie semi-starlet is in these days. It's fitting, then, that Ternheim's first U.S. LP (which collected highlights from her two Grammis-winning Swedish albums and a couple of EPs) bears the title <i>Halfway to Fivepoints</i>, or, if you will, <i>Halfway to Stardom</i>.<br/><br/>Ternheim is much further along to fame in her native land, where <i>Leaving on a Mayday</i> earned her Best Album honors at last year's Swedish Grammis. It's easy enough to see why. <i>Somebody Outside</i> (Ternheim's 2004 debut) had some great moments-- sad-eyed opener ""To Be Gone"", the stirring ""My Secret"", and a heart-wrenching piano ballad cover of ""Shoreline""-- but was unmemorable in parts and uneven on the whole. Follow-up <i>Separation Road</i> (2006) boasted improved songwriting and lavish production, but at times all those strings and embellishments threatened to overpower Ternheim, something she herself implicitly acknowledged by including a second disc of pared down ""Naked Versions"" with deluxe copies of the LP. <i>Mayday</i>, however, is the record that gets it right. More consistent and more refined, it acutely spotlights the often understated talents of Ternheim as both a vocalist and songwriter.<br/><br/>It's also less immediate than its predecessors, and takes a few listens to reveal its hidden beauty. Until that point <i>Mayday</i> can sound a little typical, much like its song titles (""Off the Road"", ""Losing You"", ""Summer Rain"") and recurrent themes (desire, heartbreak, moving on). Less typical is Ternheim's treatment of these common songwriting tropes. Pay close attention to the lyrics and you'll find even the most potentially joyous of moments is shot through with a Swedish sense of melancholy, very much of a tradition that stretches from August Strindberg to Ingmar Bergman to Victoria Bergsman.</p>
<p>The innocent infatuation of a line like ""I hope you feel the way I do,"" on opener ""What Have I Done"", is soon followed with the wizened resignation of ""I'm damned to feel the way I do""-- this is an artist who has been through all of this enough times before to know what she's getting herself into, and rather than celebrate new love she's lamenting her powerlessness in the face of it. As the record unfolds, this lack of control, whether in managing desire or preventing heartbreak, takes on the characteristics of addiction and fixation. ""What keeps you from moving, are you afraid to be loved?"" she prompts on ""Damaged Ones"". ""See how my hands shake? I was raised on it like a drug."" Elsewhere, on ""Terrified"", she speaks of ""the beast in me,"" while ""Losing You"", musically the record's most single-ready track, is not about the relationship on the rocks its title might suggest but rather a loved one's apparent descent into senility.</p>
<p>Tough stuff, but it comes in a refreshing musical package that shifts the focus from the dark and wounded. Also helpful are quiet and stately moments like the vaguely East Asian-flavored ""Terrified"", delicate slowburner ""My Heart Still Beats for You"", and the desert raga ""Off the Road"", which features the finger-picking prowess of Sweeney. ""Summer Rain"" strips things down even further and may be the record's most rewarding moment, a loss-of-faith lament that makes the most of a strummed acoustic guitar and gorgeous vocal harmonies. Whether it will all translate to Stateside success for Ternheim probably comes down to a question of exposure. A recent Chicago show, where a solo Ternheim was the first of three acts, proved that she can hold a crowd enrapt-- even one that is not necessarily familiar with her music. But the key for this talent may well be to break free of the trappings of an insular indie scene, land an opening spot on some Starbucks darling's auditorium tour, and pray for that one crucial season finale/closing credits song placement. It's not selling out if it's where you were meant to be all along.</p></div>"|13889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13889-leaving-on-a-mayday/|7.5|Matthew Solarski

In practice, though, they're more of a singles act. Since 2002, they've released a few dozen 7"" and 12"" singles, usually in ""collectible"" quantities. So this isn't a follow-up to <i>Chemistry</i>: It's their second singles compilation, and like the first one, <i>Epics in Minutes</i>, it's thoroughly disorderly. This one begins with their debut single, the not-quite-there-yet ""No Pasaran"", then leapfrogs around their career, encompassing a handful of A-sides, B-sides, and demos, as well as a 2008 Daytrotter session.</p>
<p>Despite its nonchronological sequencing and song-cherrypicking, it never really comes together as an album; it's more like ""the many moods of Fucked Up,"" or, rather, their many variations on one mood. When punk bands expand their palettes, it usually means they take a stab at some form that's not all about loud-hard-fast. Fucked Up have planted their flag in loud-hard-fast pretty firmly, and Damian ""Pink Eyes"" Abraham's steel-wool bellow is the central point of their sound. Most of their best songs, like the torrential six-minute ""Triumph of Life"" (a demo of a <i>Hidden World</i> track), expand the boundaries of hardcore punk, rather than moving outside it: they're flexing their heads, as it were.</p>
<p>The less impressive songs here, on the other hand, are just really well-played hardcore with a huge guitar sound, for which there's something to be said. ""Generation"" might be a parody of lunkheadbanging straightedge anthems, but it's functionally very similar to the real thing, for both good and ill: it rocks like crazy, Pink Eyes sounds absolutely committed in his howls about ""no hesitation/ Freedom or death"", and there might be a very tiny set of quotation marks hovering around its riff or lyrics. ""Fixed Race"" is a distant cousin of Wire's proto-hardcore anthem ""12XU"", and that's about all there is to it. A simple, straight-ahead version of ""No Epiphany"" is perfectly okay, but it also makes <i>Chemistry</i>'s not-at-all-simple version sound much cooler by comparison.</p>
<p><i>Couple Tracks</i> also features Fucked Up's covers of three very angry, very un-hardcore-punk bands: Another Sunny Day (""Anorak City""), the Shop Assistants (""I Don't Wanna Be Friends with You"" and ""Looking Back""), and Dolly Mixture (""Dream Come True"" and ""He's So Frisky""). That's a beautiful gesture-- Fucked Up's relationship with twee pop isn't an outsider's ha-ha perspective, it's genuine engagement with an entire scene that's got an unlikely but undeniable formal link with their own work. Still, it's a gesture: Performing scalding hardcore versions of those songs doesn't add much to them or play to Fucked Up's strengths. (Also, ""I don't want to be civilized/ You leave me and I'll scratch your eyes out"" has distinctly different implications coming from a screaming 300-pound man than it did when the Shop Assistants' waifish Alex Taylor sang it.)</p>
<p>The most interesting reinventions here, actually, are both Fucked Up covering themselves: the Daytrotter remakes of <i>Chemistry</i>'s ""Magic Word"" and <i>Hidden World</i>'s ""David Comes to Life"", which run Pink Eyes' hollering through some kind of echo-flange mangler. ""Magic Word"" loosens up its riff and its rhythm into an exuberant strut, and ""David"" becomes what the band called ""a straight up disco dance version"" at the time (post-Chic guitars, a beat that gallops as much as it stomps). Each of them blasts at least as hard as the original version but effectively finds a different song within its outlines-- examples in miniature of what Fucked Up have been doing for hardcore.</p></div>"|13860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13860-couple-tracks/|6.8|Douglas Wolk

The most obviously unnerving thing about the duo is its vocal dynamic: Jonathan Bree has a droll, modestly handsome voice that brings to mind a bookish dude in his thirties, and Heather Mansfield is chirpy, perky, and seldom sounds a day over 14. Mansfield's little-girl act is a deliberate affectation, and their music is very much part of a long tradition of twee indie pop that knowingly mingles adult sexuality with a playful, innocent tone. This is very self-aware music, but nevertheless it gets kinda tricky to figure out when the Brunettes are making the subtext in the contrast of their voices the hook of their music, or when they're just doing cutesy songs for the sake of it.</p>
<p>The age dynamic isn't the only unusual tension on the Auckland, New Zealand-based duo's fourth album, <i>Paper Dolls</i>. As on their previous records, their compositions strike an odd balance of child-like singsong simplicity and subtle sophistication. Any time the group start to sound overly naive and artless, there is some kind of musical curveball thrown in to keep things from getting too flat and predictable. You wouldn't want to call any of these tracks complex, but Bree and Mansfield consistently add welcome dimension to songs that could easily come across as dumb and fluffy. This is a good thing, but the negative side effect is that this tendency flattens out the tone of the record as a whole. As much as whimsical tracks like ""Red Rollerskates"" and ""In Colours"" benefit from a bit of musical depth, the relatively mature electronic aesthetics of ""Bedroom Disco"" and ""Connection"" get muffled by their insistence on being adorable, making those songs sound like a preschool version of Broadcast circa <i>Tender Buttons</i>. Even the most enjoyable tracks here are cloying, and their best ideas are just things we've heard before in an indie marketplace choked with the twee sensibility.</p>
<p>To be clear, there's nothing wrong with being cute, and the Lolita thing is generally done in interesting rather than off-putting ways. The problem with <i>Paper Dolls</i> is that, even though the Brunettes have set up some potentially intriguing contrasts, they never fully investigate the tensions in their music. ""If I"", a corny ballad near the end of the album, has Mansfield talking down to Bree's schmaltzy sentimentality-- ""If I should accidentally die and leave you much too soon, would you play and sing our songs the same with somebody new?""-- but that's as close as they come to subverting their dynamic, or even commenting on it in an overt way. It may be unfair to complain that a band is not sufficiently meta, but all the same, this is self-consciously clever music that is too shy to make any sort of point. These songs, especially ""Magic (No Bunny)"" and the Bis-esque ""The Crime Machine"", can work on a superficial level, but there's really not much else here. Bree and Mansfield have perfected their style, but they've come up very short on content.</p></div>"|13888.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13888-paper-dolls/|5.3|Matthew Perpetua

Alongside bigger acts such as Sunn O))) and Grouper (not true drone, but plenty drone-y), artists like Emeralds, Black to Comm, and Yellow Swans are each tugging the style into intriguing directions. Daniel Lopatin, who records as Oneohtrix Point Never and shares a label with Emeralds, could plausibly be lumped into this group but also exists outside of it. Where others bring to bear a wide range of instrumentation in creating these glistening, open-ended sounds, Lopatin does so using only electronics (synthesizers and arpeggiators, primarily) and as a result, his music is arguably more distinctive and often more difficult to pin down.</p>
<p>Because he's worked outside the label structure and released albums on limited-run cassette and CD-R until now, Lopatin's music also hasn't been easy to find. But <i>Rifts</i>, a 2xCD collection of his material since 2003 (including all three Oneohtrix Point Never full-lengths-- <i>Betrayed in the Octagon</i>, <i>Zones Without People</i>, and <i>Russian Mind</i>), seeks to correct that by compiling just about everything he's recorded as OPN to date. At two and a half hours long, it's a dizzying amount of music and virtually impossible to absorb in one sitting but for anyone with a passing interest in drone or ambient music, it's worth setting aside the time.</p>
<p>Part of the reason <i>Rifts</i> feels like a crucial listen is that Lopatin's approach is so thoroughly his own, to the point that trying to attach it to one genre doesn't really work. At turns icy and serene, at others frenetic and twisted, it feels like a modern sci-fi remake of minimalism and kosmiche-- there are long, repetitious builds with big openings between notes that suggest vast space and long drift. Intricate synth arrangements unfurl over long stretches in tracks like ""Immanence"" and ""Ships Without Meaning"" to create a sense of endless glide. In this capacity, Lopatin proves he can reconstruct drone on his own terms, but on <i>Rifts</i>' more forceful, tech-y songs he shows that's not the only trick up his sleeve.</p>
<p>The three LPs joined together in <i>Rifts</i> were supposedly intended as a trilogy, and while they do work as a unified whole, it seems wisest to approach the record as a compilation. The sheer size of it is daunting and you don't lose much by listening to its separate movements individually. Within these smaller pieces, Lopatin oscillates between the long-form mechanized whir described above and shorter tracks that push the album forward and draw back your attention after lengthy drifts. More <i>Blade Runner</i> than <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, ""Computer Vision"" and ""Betrayed in the Octagon"" use chopped-up, rapid-fire synths for propulsion and quick tonal shifts to add color. This is precisely the kind of music some would criticize as robotic and unfeeling, but for such heavily computerized sounds, Lopatin also shows a way with mood-- a song like ""A Pact Between Strangers"" is dark and threatening, like walking into a strange home with all the lights off.</p>
<p>But maybe what's most impressive about <i>Rifts</i> is that Lopatin creates a singular kind of noise-- there just aren't many albums out there that <i>sound</i> like this-- and rides it for nearly three hours without repeating himself very often. In this sense, the recent LP it reminds me of is Dâm-Funk's <i>Toeachizown</i>, in that the vibe is inseparable from the artist, clearly the work of one person with a novel agenda and the chops to see it through to the finish. And like Dâm-Funk's, it's the type of music that doesn't knock you over the head at first, but sort of seeps into your pores over time, uncovering new pleasures when you inevitably come back for more.</p></div>"|13896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13896-rifts/|8.0|Joe Colly

""If you look at three notes, there are fewer possibilities. Twelve notes, far fewer."" The pair was discussing Ornette Coleman's ""harmolodics,"" but that more-is-less philosophy also fits Nmperign's music. Trumpeter Greg Kelley and soprano saxophonist Bhob Rainey deal primarily in slow, sparse sounds-- sounds that approach, and sometimes achieve, total silence. By treating each moment as an opportunity rather than just another stepping stone, they give all their squeaks, breaths, and noises a tension that hectic music usually avoids.</p>
<p>Over the past decade or so, this kind of improvisation has been called many things-- reductionism, lowercase music, laminal music, ""the new silence."" And those labels have been slapped on everyone from Spanish sound artist Mattin to British bassist Mark Wastell, to American drummer Sean Meehan, to the wealth of fine musicians on the Erstwhile label. Since most of these artists are free improvisers, open to all sounds and styles, it's not surprising that they often bristle at these labels-- Mattin and Wastell even made a record in 2006 called <i>Reductionism Is Dead.</i></p>
<p>Still, if all of this constitutes even a loose genre, Nmperign are surely amongst its leaders. In the decade-plus that they've played together, Kelley and Rainey have partnered with many like-minded musicians-- experimental sound artists Jason Lescaleet, Günter Müller, Alex Dörner-- as well as rock-leaning colleagues like Akron/Family and Damon &amp; Naomi. In fact, they've been so busy with collaborations that this is the first studio album made by themselves. But it's no debut-- every second here shows how the pair's sonic communication has become as natural as spoken language.</p>
<p>Exactly what makes up their language is hard to pin down. It's easy enough to catalog all the nouns and verbs and see <i>Ommatidia</i> simply as a collection of tones, growls, and shrieks. But it's the sentences-- the way Kelley and Rainey arrange sounds and silences into commas and periods-- that produce magic. Some moments do capture the whole-- take the interlocking tones at the end of opener ""Glass"", the bursts of blare that cut hard to silence in ""Prey"", the windy whistling in ""Variations V"". But none of those moments would be as effective without what comes before and after. And though Nmperign's open approach makes everything spontaneous, you'll be surprised by how logical and structured it can all sound.</p>
<p>Of course, logic and structure here are relative terms-- in the context of all music, Nmperign's is an acquired taste. Even if you know this style well, you have to switch mental modes to fully absorb it. Put <i>Ommatidia</i> on as background, and its bursts of activity might cut through, but you'll miss a lot of it, too. Engage directly, though, and Kelley and Rainey's menagerie of sounds become more fascinating the closer you zoom in. In fact, maybe we should call Nmperign ""expansionist."" Their music may seem ""reductionist,"" but its effect-– they way it increases your attention and expands your senses-- is far from minimal.</p></div>"|13776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13776-ommatidia/|7.4|Marc Masters

Had a razorblade popped out of 2008's <i>We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed</i>, I doubt anyone would've blinked an eye. Over the past three years, Los Campesinos! transformed themselves from a smart, spry, neon pop group possessed with a seemingly boundless everykid exuberance to a bunch of noisy, angry, funny weirdos. Their near-blindingly bright debut LP, <i>Hold On Now Youngster</i>, sat on shelves for a scant eight months before the group followed it with <i>We Are Beautiful</i>, a squalid spleen-venter. They started touring with noise-rock bands. Gareth Campesinos!, lead shouter/songwriter, began barking for heavy stuff like Xiu Xiu and Parenthetical Girls on their Twitter; then, they got the guy from Xiu Xiu to guest on their latest record. In practically a year's time, Gareth went from phrase-turning, scene-critiquing clever kid to a sadsack of Steven Patrick Morrissey proportions, while his band loosened up and billowed out, their grandiose pop growing at once messier and more symphonic. It's all been pretty good.</p>
<p>And it all comes to a head here on <i>Romance Is Boring</i>, their third proper LP. All that they've managed to do over the three short years-- the not-so-quiet confidence and compositional precision of their earlier work, the weary weather-beaten sound of <i>We Are Beautiful</i>, and of course Gareth's hilarious, grotesque, and immensely affecting character sketches-- finds its way onto <i>Romance</i>. And Gareth, poor hilarious Gareth, though still very concerned with the goings-on around his navel, has turned his gaze outward just a bit; heck, the first line on the record has him pleading to ""talk about you for a minute."" They're still utter musical maximalists, still keen to shout when the time calls, and still led by a perpetual malcontent, but <i>Romance Is Boring</i> feels like the payoff of three years of extremely hard work; Gareth may never settle down exactly, but his band's sure getting some stuff figured out.</p>
<p>On sonics alone, <i>Romance Is Boring</i> is a triumph; bringing back <i>We Are Beautiful</i>'s John Goodmanson as producer, they've expanded their already sizable instrumental palette, thrown a little more space into the still-crowded mix, and figured out a way to make the big moments count even more by pulling back during the ones that mean less. Whereas before, it occasionally seemed as though they were piling on instruments just to keep idle hands busy, they've learned not to do everything at once. Gareth's been badmouthing their early reliance on glockenspiel to just about anybody who'll listen these days, and there's definitely a deemphasis on the cuter side of things; that's clear as soon as you hit the turgid electronic breakdown of ""In Medias Res"". Those still-great old numbers from the <i>Sticking Fingers Into Sockets</i> EP sound like they were written by some gifted children, the jarring wallow of <i>We Are Beautiful</i> like young adults; the comparatively subtle <i>Romance Is Boring</i> feels almost full-grown.</p>
<p>Gareth, too, is showing off some of the wisdom of his not-so-advanced age; a limber, funny, and often uncomfortably direct lyricist, he's a little less concerned with being clever here. One striking thing about <i>Romance</i> is how little concern there seems to be with rhyme schemes, as if expression of these thoughts couldn't be relegated to some prescribed formula. Because he writes well over the lines, songs start and end in strange places-- ""Straight in at 101"" kicks off with a knee-slapper about post-rock and winds down with a televised countdown of worst breakups ever-- but it has the naturalistic feel of a stream-of-consciousness confessional written by a dude who's been through a lot and spent even more time thinking about it. He's always managed to find the humor in the tragic, but here, he finds time for both. He begins one song detailing a friend's struggles with eating disorders, then leads off the next with a unison scream urging one and all to ""calm the fuck down."" Because so much of this seems ripped from the pages of Gareth's journal-- and because he still sings like he's gonna blow up at any moment-- the urgency of all that he's trying to convey can knock you flat. There may be slicker songwriters, and there are many more economical, but there are few more honest, more willing to put it all out there, and for many, more relatable.</p>
<p>For some, the cohesive, self-assured <i>Romance</i> will be their favorite Los Campesinos! record; others will continue to prefer the extremity of what came before. That's the breaks with an intensely personal band like this, I suppose; you're going to get intensely personal reactions. Speaking as somebody a little older than your average Campesino!, I can tell you I'm glad to be out of the shitstorm of my early twenties on display here, but I do remember it well; never better than when I'm listening to this band, for better and worse. I can remember at that age feeling constantly on the verge of something, but not knowing sure just what. <i>Romance Is Boring</i> smacks of that feeling, knowing more than before but still trying to hash out just where to go with it. It's fun watching bands grow; it's been a pleasure watching this band grow up.</p></div>"|13879.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13879-romance-is-boring/|8.3|Paul Thompson

Under a pair of pseudonyms (Blood Orange is the other), Hynes gives away impossible-to-digest amounts of free music online. Most recently, Hynes had his heart sawed to pieces by adorable animated bears in the Kanye West-endorsed (all caps: ""THIS IS DOPE"") video for Basement Jaxx's 2009 electro-pop stunner ""My Turn"", a song he co-wrote. As Hynes wonders aloud, ""When will this all start?"" it sounds like he knows it probably won't. If ""My Turn"" lays bare Hynes' fears, his Lightspeed project battles them-- eccentrically and at times too obscurely, but no less quixotically.</p>
<p>As Lightspeed, Hynes flees from the trends that briefly propelled his former band, while inevitably failing to escape them. His 2008 debut, <i>Falling Under the Lavender Bridge</i>, embraced the Americana twang of Saddle Creek in-house producer Mike Mogis, skewering ghetto-fetishizing peers with songs like ""All My Friends Are Listening to Crunk"". It was hard to tell who was being more ironic. Appropriately, then, <i>Life Is Sweet! Nice to Meet You</i> brings on a producer with a hip-hop background, Ben Allen, who also oversaw a little record called <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i>. For better and worse, Lightspeed's sophomore album plays like a product of Hynes' restlessness. Alternately inspired and frustrating, it addresses themes of lost love (and lost chicness) with Queen-size 70s-rock pomp, neoclassical interludes, and one ukulele-based chamber-pop song.</p>
<p>Hynes can shred, too, laying down a nasty guitar solo on the album's first single, ""Marlene"", a twitchy but slightly overlong funk barrage that could make ""more triangle"" the new ""more cowbell."" ""Stop being cool,"" Hynes demands, a refrain that might be a mission statement for the whole Lightspeed project. The catchiest song, live favorite ""Madame Van Damme"", takes hipster self-loathing to its cheerful extreme, repeating, ""Kill me, baby, won't ya kill me,"" over a light girl-group bounce. Heaven knows he's miserable now, but ""Faculty of Fears"" goes one Morrissey hiccup too far, tethering a badass bass groove to inscrutable lyrics about sarongs and Pythagorean theorems.</p>
<p>The best and the worst of <i>Life Is Sweet! Nice to Meet You</i> meet on ""The Big Guns of Highsmith"". First it's a clever kiss-off to London: ""Chelsea teas and Socrates still haunt me/ A life I strived and chased and had and lost."" Then it's clever self-recrimination: ""Hurts be to be the one who's always feeling sad,"" Hynes whines, before a Greek chorus retorts, ""Oh, just stop complaining!"" This dry self-awareness puts the album's remaining highlights-- baroque keyboard plaint ""Middle of the Dark"", spaghetti-Western epic ""Sweetheart"", jazz-splashed rumination ""Smooth Day (At the Library)""-- in proper context. It's also bloodlessly cerebral. We are not the champions, my friends. Hynes has been, and still could be again, but for now he's keeping that English stiff upper lip about it.</p></div>"|13834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13834-life-is-sweet-nice-to-meet-you/|6.7|Marc Hogan

I've heard a bit of Harper's solo output, and while it's quite pretty and a fine showcase for her swooping, evocative voice, the equally moody but more dance-friendly Class Actress suggests trading the coffeehouse for the nightclub was an excellent decision.</p>
<p>Class Actress' initial release, the <i>Journal of Ardency</i> EP, couldn't be more resolutely 1980s-vintage if it'd been put out on cassette tape. Sonically, the group freely appropriates the sullen synthetics of New Order, the Human League, and Depeche Mode. But where Ladyhawke or Telepathe's Melissa Livaudais match coolly detached, affectless vocals to those artificial tones, Harper offers a playful, breathy coo that hearkens back to hipster queens like Blondie's Debbie Harry and Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell.</p>
<p>""Careful What You Say"" opens the EP, and from its initial noisy synth blurts you'd be forgiven for thinking we were entering Crystal Castles territory. Soon enough, however, Harper shows up to assure us that we're actually in for chic pop froth. Insouciant as her pipes may be, Harper's lyrics are more interesting and cutting than your typical indie-dance fare, perhaps a byproduct of her aforementioned former life as a folkie, where words have nowhere to hide. ""You've woken the guards,"" Harper chides, lending romantic discord the tension of a heist film.</p>
<p>The title track also throws a curveball-- creepy, Knife-ish synths that lead into a rubbery groove and sighing melody. The real leftfield treat, however, is the third track, ""Let Me Take You Out"", which proves the group's record collection doesn't consist solely of synth-pop-- apparently they expanded their horizons to include mopey 80s guitar music, too, particularly the Cure and the Smiths. ""Let Me Take You Out"" not only evokes lyrics from ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"" in its title, but Harper also mimics Morrissey's haunting vocal swoons, while the music conjures up the best giddy guitar-pop rushes of Robert Smith's bunch.</p>
<p><i>Journal of Ardency</i>'s final two tracks prove the EP's title accurate. Harper demonstrates a facility for empathizing with outsized teenage lovesickness in ""Adolescent Heart"" and then shows why with ""Someone Real"", which finds her admitting, ""I truly obsess over every word you say,"" before begging a prospective lover to ""believe me when I tell you that you need someone real."" Were Harper setting her pleas for shared emotional transparency against a softly strummed guitar, it all might be a bit <i>too</i> real, but atop stark beats and malfunctioning synth twinkles that sound like kissing cousins to Junior Boys' ""Under the Sun"", her passion proves to be the same kind of compelling counterweight to frosty sonics that helped make the music of her influences so memorable.</p></div>"|13847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13847-journal-of-ardency/|7.0|Joshua Love

She sweeps out the dark corners of electronic music, reclaiming whatever scraps of sonic information slip free from the nets of genres. These splinters of melody, bits of noise, subliminal streaks of rhythm, and bewildered voices are compressed into a nebulous whole. Volume is more important than harmony. Greie often operates somewhere beyond music, probing into sculpture, science, and math.</p>
<p>Greie's sixth solo album as AGF, <i>Einzelkämpfer</i>, is a mix of spoken-word, singing, low-key noise, and the occasional distended rhythm. Rather than building, her tracks keep flexing and doubling back. Some verifiable songs slip out of the haze: The title track, though it begins in a dripping tunnel of beats and warbles, emerges into something like dehydrated Fever Ray. And ""Worin mein Mund Zur Bewegung Fand"" sounds like Alison Goldfrapp singing in a junkyard where someone happens to be playing a Morton Feldman record at half speed.</p>
<p>But more often the music is just a receptacle for fantastic shapes and incongruous images. On the beautifully designed ""We Break Out"", with clip-clopping drums and a synth tone that keeps popping out like a broken spring, anxiously pitch-shifting vocal harmonies run alongside a calm recitation. It's a motif that repeats across the album. Greie keeps splitting into two beings, one impassive and the other freaked out, talking over each other. It's like those Beach Boys songs where the backing vocals contradict all the exhortations to have fun, but elevated to full-bore dissociative identity disorder.</p>
<p>""You invented language,"" Greie confides conspiratorially on ""Alone in the Woods (The Fox, the Skunk and the Rabbit)"", but <i>Einzelkämpfer </i>takes up the concept of the ""lone warrior,"" (the word's English meaning) so of course, she's talking to herself. Before translating the German, you might gather that her dry, tart delivery represents what she intends to say, while its distressed twin is what the listener hears. It's challenging to box what we mean in language, and to ensure that the contents don't shift in transit. But the problem turns out to be simpler than that-- there simply isn't anyone to talk to. On ""Practicing Beat Anarchy"", she sounds out the words of the title roughly, as if trying to force some meaning into them. It's a solitary war of attrition. By closing track ""On Earth"", every trace of the communicative has vanished into a primordial ooze of voiceless low frequencies. After all the torturous expression, this arrives as an almost physical relief.</p></div>"|13785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13785-einzelkampfer/|7.3|Brian Howe

Really, Saviours? The recent resurgence of run'n'gun thrash metal has spawned many nascent spandex-clad spitfires over the last couple of years. Until recently, it seemed to afflict only the relatively young-- a generation tired of working through Sabbath and ready to take it up with the Dark Angel. With <i>Accelerated Living</i>, Oakland's Saviours have fallen prey to the same tri-wristed beast as this younger crowd, dialing down the sludgy thwomp of their previous work, and thrashing about for a whole LP. It says something about Saviours' talents as a band that a fairly sharp turn like <i>Accelerated Living</i> doesn't totally suck, but it says something else about the band that the best compliment you can pay to their mini-Mustainery is that it's very, very reverent. This is a band still looking for an identity to call its own, and as such, the restless <i>Accelerated Living</i> feels decidedly transitional.</p>
<p>After a couple of LPs and EPs apiece, Saviours seemed to hit on something with 2008's <i>Into Abaddon</i>, a potent blend of Brit-metal triumph with gnarled Southern scum. They thrashed, too, but tendon-tearing riffage wasn't the name of the game. By making the jump from boggy, expansive muck to this insistence on whiplash, Saviours have shed a good deal of the dynamism that made them one to watch in the first place.</p>
<p>Like any good thrash metal record, <i>Accelerated Living</i> does zero to 60 right, blasting off admirably on the breakneck ""Acid Hand"". But it's almost as if somebody snapped off the cruise control lever, and aside from a few brief bits of spacy respite, we're at 60 for nearly 50 minutes. Their singularity of purpose is admirable, but with its slate gray production and unerring tempo, <i>Living</i> feels like a chore by its halfway point. The hurried nature of the music leads to harried playing, and vocalist Austin Barber, who could do a number on the woozier, wider <i>Abaddon</i>, seems to be in a perpetual rush to get out what he's saying.</p>
<p>The best thrash records-- from the old guard, anyhow-- find a way to carve out a little room amidst the pummeling to insert personality, nuance, puke breaks. In that sense, the comparatively unrelenting <i>Accelerated Living</i> veers closer to one of the better records from a classic-era thrash also-ran, a little too concerned with bowling you over with speed to stop and think how they might bring you back for another go. One gets the feeling that's not a great concern of Saviours; whenever they pop up next, they may well be on to another genre altogether.</p></div>"|13729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13729-accelerated-living/|6.6|Paul Thompson

While Knox occasionally ventured outside his native land, the charismatic/confrontational Enemy/Toy Love/Tall Dwarfs frontman and solo act spent most of his life home supporting New Zealand's productive arts scene, paving the way for such acts as the Clean, the Chills, and the Verlaines. Along the way Knox amassed more than his share of fans around the world, too, and when news spread that he suffered a stroke last summer, support and sympathy arrived in equal measure to his stature.</p>
<p>Still, that doesn't quite prepare you for the quantity and quality of A-list acts that appear on Merge's <i>Stroke: Songs for Chris Knox</i>, a 2xCD tribute to the man and his music whose proceeds will go toward his recovery (Knox, 57, currently has limited speech and mobility). (<a href=""http://www.mergerecords.com/stroke/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pre-orders</a> are currently being accepted, and the record is out now digitally.) The sheer breadth and diversity of this recorded response almost begs disbelief, considering how quickly it came together, and really shows how far Knox's influence has reached, from several of his Kiwi peers to kindred spirits. The already much missed Jay Reatard starts off the set well-paired with the Toy Love nugget ""Pull Down the Shades"", ""recorded in the bathroom of a hotel in Denmark on a 4-track,"" and the just plain missing Jeff Mangum, whose cover of the Tall Dwarfs' ""Sign the Dotted Line"" marks a rare recorded reappearance of the Neutral Milk Hotel mastermind, whose own lo-fi inclinations lined up well with Knox's.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the presence of Mangum is just the tip of the iceberg. The cavalcade of high-profile support continues with Bill Callahan and Will Oldham, whose versions of ""Lapse"" and a stunning ""My Only Friend"", respectively, remind that Knox could be as moving as theatrically manic. Stephin Merritt (who enlisted Knox to close the first 6ths album) simultaneously pays homage to Knox's aesthetic while reminding us of his own home recording roots with his (allegedly circa 1983!) version of ""Beauty"". Yo La Tengo mellow out ""Coloured"" and Lambchop offer a faithfully piano-led ren
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
dition of ""What Goes Up"". Elsewhere AC Newman's ""Dunno Much About Life But I Know How to Breathe"" channels Knox's trademark lust-for-life brio, while John Darnielle personalizes his sympathetic Mountain Goats track ""Brave"" with a get-well introduction. Longtime Kiwi pop aficionado (and top secret Merge Records co-founder) Mac McCaughan tackles ""Nostalgia's No Excuse"" as Portastatic, replete with an approximation of Knox's sneer and dollops of fuzzy distortion.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there's the host of New Zealand acts paying their respects to their friend and inspiration. Flying Nun peers and veterans such as the Bats, Verlaines, Hamish, and David Kilgour (of the Clean), the Chills, Peter Gutteridge (providing a hypnotically reinvented ""Don't Catch Fire""), and Shayne Carter (of Straightjacket Fits) make appearances, as do relatively fresh faces like the Checks (doing Toy Love's ""Rebel""), the Mint Chicks, and Pumice. Even some bona fide Antipodean stars show up, including Don McGlashan (of the Mutton Birds) and Neil Finn (who covers ""It's Love"" with his wife and two kids). It's a bit of a bummer that MOR singer Boh Runga gets Knox's beloved ""Not Given Lightly"", especially considering Pearl Jam covered it well on tour in New Zealand last November and could have provided this comp yet another ringer, but her heart is in the right place.</p>
<p>Special mention, of course, must go to Alec Bathgate, Knox's longtime partner in the Tall Dwarfs and the co-writer of many of these tracks, who contributes a sterling version of the solo Knox gem ""Glide"". There are other treats and surprises in store, too, from Jordan Luck's inspired choice of ""Becoming Something Other"" (about a father stricken by Parkinson's, highlighting Knox's sometimes twisted but always humanist lyrics) to SJD namesake Sean Donnelly's lovely ""The Outer Skin"" (a song covered by the Hope Blister way back when) to Lou Barlow's ""Song of the Tall Puppy"", from 2008's Chris Knox and the Nothing album<i> A Warm Gun</i>, a gentle reminder that the guy still makes records.</p>
<p>Which leads us to the best surprises of them all: new recordings from both the Nothing and Tall Dwarfs. The Nothing song in particular, ""Nappin' in Lapland"", offers a glimpse of Knox's novel, inspiring way around his predicament: songs with singing, but no words. Leave it to Chris Knox not to ever let a little thing like a debilitating stroke get in the way of making music.</p></div>"|13859.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13859-stroke-songs-for-chris-knox/|8.2|Joshua Klein

Instead, over the course of three tremendous releases, they've churned out bruising, noise-splashed sounds à la Liars circa <i>Drum's Not Dead</i>. Their interest seems to have lain more in making sonic sense of chaos, a hypnotic form they've fleshed out further on <i>To Realize</i>, their second full-length effort.</p>
<p>They accomplished that by letting go in a way. 2007's <i>Hoarse Lords</i> was tightly wound despite its constant rattle, and it retained some semblances of traditional song structure. It felt neither fully realized nor fully formed, and that sounded perfectly awesome. <i>To Realize </i>places its faith in texture, atmospherics, and shades of light and dark. Any notion of melody takes a deep back seat to feeling and groove, be it of the lockstepped Krautrock variety, tribalist pulse or gut-level clatter. Ecklein's bass figures in particular act as a focal point, a heartbeat to follow through the fray. That said, these songs have a very natural pull and feel-- every movement, be it seasick or cutting, leads back into the tracks' centers.</p>
<p>A loose, opening drone séance, ""Strangler"" sets a mood but belies its name. Over languorous drum hits, bassist Scott Ecklein and guitarist Nick Barbeln chant bleak lines about lost highways. While it can be tough to make them out at times, lyrically the two lean heavily with imagery that's overtly post-apocalyptic. (This actually could have made an excellently fucked up soundtrack to <i>The Road</i> or <i>The Book of Eli</i>.) On that path, ""Blood"" rumbles even harder: The arrival of Barbeln's serrated, high-arching guitar lines flipping the song from black-and-white to color.</p>
<p>Eye-opening moments like these are tucked away in various crevices throughout <i>To Realize</i> and they not only present themselves further with repeated listens, they gain strength as well. The opening blast of ""Dust"" hits harder with every subsequent take. The way horns are married to screams in ""Atoms"" sounds absolutely evil. And, exactly one second after it passes its five-minute mark, ""Home"" simply erupts. It's kind of a hike to get there, but that song's final stretch is certainly one of the record's most exhilarating: 90 seconds in which all of the errant moaning, groaning, and floating debris combine to draw blood as one massive torrent. Through those six-plus minutes of ""Home"" it becomes clear this is an experience to be taken in full. That can certainly be fatiguing and even boring for some. But the result is comfortably atonal-- a headphones listen that's difficult but ultimately more haunting.</p></div>"|13881.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13881-to-realize/|7.7|David Bevan

Even in music, an entire generation seems to have been introduced to electronics via horror's flea-market <i>musique concrète</i> and perverted keyboard themes-- the knife-on-bone analog scraping and primitive digital squeals heard in <i>The</i> <i>Shining</i> and <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>; the way John Carpenter managed to sneak proto-techno minimalism into America's drive-ins and living rooms.</p>
<p>I've no idea whether French producer Etienne Jaumet was exposed to these films during his formative years, but while the title of <i>Night Music</i> seems, on first blush, like another limp evocation of techno-cool, I think he's got something more sinister up his sleeve. Jaumet's debut album throbs, groans, and wails with the pants-wetting and sleep-disrupting sonorities of all your horror faves. An occasional cop to placidity and prettiness aside-- the folkie picking that closes his 20-minute opening opus ""For Falling Asleep"" offers a little light-- this is one <i>creepy</i> album. Even the song titles-- ""Mental Vortex"", ""Through the Strata""-- read like placeholders handed to a composer for the scenes when a possessed Christopher Lee starts spooking English schoolchildren. And it seems like no coincidence that Jaumet got his start in a duo called Zombie Zombie, though his tracks proceed with sequenced dread rather than the lurches and starts of the undead.</p>
<p>Still, plenty of <i>Night Music</i> sounds like pure old-school techno. Listen to the metallic electro-funk percussion of ""Entropy""-- that warmly familiar Roland-right-out-of-the-box programming-- or the Vangelis-with-cold-sweats synth arpeggios throughout, and it will be no surprise to learn that Detroit godfather/gadfly Carl Craig midwifed the album. And it's possible to hear honest-to-God influence drawn from all the Krautrock heroes and ""serious"" composers name-dropped in Jaumet's press materials. ""Psychedelic""? Sure, but probably the kind of trip that ends in a locked-ward sanitarium. And I dunno what Domino's PR folks were listening to when they called <i>Night Music</i> ""dreamy,"" but it certainly wasn't the hounds-of-hell strings screaming through ""Strata"". That was the first tune on <i>Night Music</i> to truly stab me in the ears, jolt me out of passive listening, force me to play it again and again even as it unnerved me. <i>Night Music</i>'s rawness-- Jaumet even manages to make a saxophone, that treacly emblem of kitschy synth-pop cocktail bar culture-- sound visceral and disturbing on ""At the Crack of Dawn""-- is what separates the album from the glut of 80s jackers. Jaumet is steeped in history, even if it's not necessarily the history his advance notice suggests. But retro sleekness interests him not at all, and in a world of bloodless digital soundscaping, exposing the guts in his machines is why we should be paying attention.</p></div>"|13874.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13874-night-music/|7.5|Jess Harvell

Further singles and chart appearances culminated in 2007's <i>Think Before You Spea</i>k, a charmingly heartfelt album somewhere between a less insular Arctic Monkeys and a less caffeinated Futureheads-- romantic insecurities you could dance to in your trainers. When sharply accented singer/guitarist Rhys Jones sang, ""Things were better when we were young,"" the future still sounded bright.</p>
<p>Now-- <i>No Hope, No Future</i>. The world has changed a whole lot since the mid-2000s, musically and geopolitically, and Good Shoes are probably being at least half-serious about their sophomore album's title. The London four-piece are confronting the same boring bummer as so many others in this ""new 'normal'"" economy. Success isn't as successful it used to be, you start growing old before you stop growing up, papa don't preach. What results is an album that sounds like the 00s even as its themes are solidly turn-of-2010. A darker album, a slightly clumsier album, but an album with a strong unifying themes and a few songs worth stepping away from the bar for.</p>
<p>""Time may change me,"" sang Bowie, ""but I can't trace time."" Guess who was taking notes. Good Shoes are obsessed with permanence and flux, what's innate in a person and what might eventually turn sour: relationships, careers. <i>No Hope, No Future</i>'s first single, ""That's the Way My Heart Beats"", bouncily blames the narrator's ongoing girl problems on something in his nature. By contrast, evocative finale ""City by the Sea""-- as close as UK indie gets to power ballads-- is right there with Death Cab for Cutie's ""Meet Me on the Equinox"": ""All I want's a little more time/ To feel your heart beat next to mine."" Everything-- <i>everything</i>-- ends.</p>
<p>After a debut record wrapped up in girls and going to shows, Good Shoes deserve credit for continuing to sing about what they know even as that gets darker. ""Times Change"", an assault on cranky oldsters, has guitars neatly uptight enough for Field Music, and it's refreshingly difficult to figure out where to put the air quotes on tense relationship-ender ""Then She Walks Away"": ""I know I should be the one to say those words/ Like, 'Times change, but I want you to stay.'""  But gloomy quarter-life crisis songs leave less room for error, and even on the latter track, Jones sings contrived-sounding words about how his words sound ""contrived.""</p>
<p>When <i>No Hope, No Future </i>isn't staring glumly into the void, Good Shoes could be a whole other band-- the band of their debut, only more seasoned. There's the Chic-chic disco-funk of ""Under Control"", which would resemble Art Brut if Eddie Argos sang about sex addiction rather than impotence. There's also the sprinting release of ""Thousand Miles an Hour"", which functions almost like a surf-rock instrumental. On ""I Know"", Jones attacks zealots of all stripes with a preachy certitude that would make Billy Bragg sound like Ghostface Killah if not for the half-winking title. It's been said the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing. Yeah, but it's also been said, ""Know thyself.""</p></div>"|13781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13781-no-hope-no-future/|5.8|Marc Hogan

Whenever his name is mentioned, it's often in the same breath as either Kenneth Anger or Charles Manson. The former association is strong-- in 1967, experimental filmmaker Anger cast BeauSoleil in his film <i>Lucifer Rising</i> and commissioned him to create the soundtrack. But the latter association is muddier. There's no question that BeauSoleil lived on Manson's ranch, and, in 1969 at age 22, killed a man during a botched drug deal. But Manson's involvement, and whether it's fair to lump the crime in with his more famous ritual murders, are matters of <a href=""http://www.beausoleil.net/wizard/Seconds%20Interview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dispute</a>. Either way, it landed BeauSoleil in prison, where he remains today.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>But back in 1965, before he met Anger or Manson, BeauSoleil was a wide-eyed teenager who <a href=""http://www.beausoleil.net/wizard/Orkustra%20Story.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">decided</a> while sitting on a rock in San Francisco's Golden Gate pond ""to assemble the first electric symphony orchestra"". The band he did form-- at first dubbed the Electric Chamber Orchestra, then the Orkustra-- was actually a five-man rock/jazz/folk hybrid. Taking cues from modal bebop and Hindu ragas, their sound was wandering and mystic, not far from the meditations of their contemporaries to the south, L.A.'s YaHoWha 13. But Orkustra music could also be sharply-crafted, using non-rock instruments like oboe and bouzouki to inject worldly flavors, anticipating similar fusions by Dead Can Dance, Camper Van Beethoven, and Sun City Girls.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>The Orkustra caught on quickly in the hippified Bay Area, and soon shared stages with the Grateful Dead and Buffalo Springfield. Their genre-straddling approach also landed them spots in folk and jazz festivals. A turn at the 1967 Invisible Circus festival inspired Anger to approach BeauSoleil, and the band broke up soon after, before they could record a proper studio album. Fortunately, Orkustra violinist David LaFlamme saved tapes of live shows and practice sessions. Two pieces from these archives surfaced on Arcanum's 2004 <i>Lucifer Rising </i>reissue, and now Mexican Summer has released the entire LaFlamme stash as a double-LP, with the aptly-rambling title <i>Adventures in Experimental Orchestra</i> <i>from the San Francisco Psychedelic Underground.</i></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>The result is not as exciting as the 4xLP box set of complete <i>Lucifer </i>sessions recently issued by the Anja label, since the Orkustra recordings are rougher and sometimes glitchy. But even during the murkiest stretches, BeauSoleil's creative fire is clear. Bright Eastern melodies like the lilting ""Bombay Calling"" meld into floating improvisations like ""Hungarian Stomp"".<span> </span>The slow sway of ""Bousaki Blues Experiment""-- a dead ringer for the Dirty Three-- matches the proggy riffage of ""Flash Gordon"" and the braying loops of ""Punjab's Barber"". Throughout, LaFlamme's searing violin winds around BeauSoleil's sandy guitar and Henry Rasof's winding oboe. The effect is hypnotic, eerie, even sinister-- a drifting take on ""snake charmer music,"" as BeauSoleil himself calls it in his entertaining liner notes. The peak is ""Gypsy Odyssey"", a 25-minute live piece performed in a church on Christmas Eve. Snippets from other Orkustra songs drift in and out of the track's muffled sound-fog, as LaFlamme pulls the group skyward like a hot-air balloon.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>The Orkustra's demise didn't stop BeauSoleil-- he formed two more groups for the <i>Lucifer </i>soundtrack, recording the final version behind prison walls. While much of that music is more sophisticated than the Orkustra material, <i>Adventures</i> has an eagerness that BeauSoleil could probably never capture again.

Then Charlotte Gainsbourg nearly died. Weeks after a minor water skiing accident, she went to the doctor with headaches only to learn her hemorrhaged head was filled with blood.</p>
<p>After summer 2007 (and successful brain surgery), the actress-singer filmed three intense movies including Lars von Trier's frightful <i>Antichrist</i>, in which she plays a grieving mother who wanders around an isolated cabin without pants on before mutilating her genitals. She also recorded <i>IRM</i>, a decidedly more palatable post-trauma piece. Written, arranged, produced, and largely played by Beck, the collaborative album marks Gainsbourg's transition from pop scion to pop <i>artiste</i>.<br/><br/>Gainsbourg's mother, singer and actress Jane Birkin, often played muse for Serge, whether she was cover star of 1971's <i>Histoire de Melody Nelson</i> or making orgasmic sounds on the hit duet ""Je t'aime...moi non plus"". And while <i>IRM</i> is marked by Beck's singular sonic accoutrements, it often plays as if Charlotte is using <i>him</i> for inspiration. The muse-y confusion is both sensible-- Beck interpolated Serge's ""Melody"" on <i>Sea Change</i>-- and oddly fated.</p>
<p>Beck's always had a cocked eye on death (remember that roaming pine box in the ""Loser"" video?) and his last three albums have focused on the ultimate end with unwavering abstract paranoia. If he's not sending up ""Profanity Prayers"" on <i>Modern Guilt</i>, he's seeing ""Strange Apparitions"" on <i>The Information</i>; as far as I know Beck did not have a near-death experience sometime around 2003, but he's been obsessed with poking at his forsaken soul ever since. Flip to Charlotte-- who became so haunted by her death scare that she underwent several MRIs (or IRMs, as the French call them) even after fully recovering-- and you've got a meeting of almost-40-year-old minds bent on exploring all the fears, mysteries, and anxieties that make death breathe. There's something to Gainsbourg's skeleton-like visage on the album's cover.</p>
<p>""Heaven can wait and hell's too far to go/ Somewhere between what you need and what you know,"" sing the pair on duet ""Heaven Can Wait"". The purgatory set up in those words informs the album's lyrics and mood, which live up to Beck's more ominous and serious guise. Whereas it can sometimes sound like Beck's already halfway into his crypt on his own songs, Gainsbourg is defiant, warm, and stoic in the face of flatlines. What could be depressing turns into a whimsical shrug on ""In the End""-- ""Who's to say it's all for the best in the end?"" hums Gainsbourg, comfortable in the unknowing. And on ""Master's Hands"", she's anything but helpless in the face of an Almighty Creator as she demands, ""Breathe out, come alive/ Give me a reason to feel."" She's in control, even when she's not.</p>
<p>There's nothing close to a love song here, a severe turnaround from Gainsbourg's Air-produced, Jarvis Cocker-written 2006 LP <i>5:55</i>, which was full of sordid, shrouded, and oddly lifeless tales of crumbling hearts. But the thematic switch goes lengths to give Gainsbourg her own identity apart from her amorous lineage. The closest thing to a Valentine's Day ode is found on the incubated folk tune ""Me and Jane Doe"". ""If I had my way I'd cross the desert to the sea/ Learn to speak in tongues, something that makes sense to you and to me,"" she sings, longingly.</p>
<p>Another reason to believe <i>IRM</i> is more than a highly accomplished puppet job: It's actually better than any album Beck himself has released in the last seven years. The nods to psych rock, junkyard blues, half-rap cadences, and ghostly ballads won't shock anyone generally familiar with Beck's oeuvre, but Gainsbourg's versatile and vulnerable vocals add a depth missing from much of her songwriter's post-<i>Sea Change</i> work.</p>
<p>She makes the most of her limited vocal abilities by switching deliveries to match her surroundings. The barely there orchestral stunner ""Vanities"" (arranged by Beck's dad David Campbell) gets a hushed quiver, the stream-of-consciousness brain-scan rock of ""IRM"" gets a zen rap, and, on the half-French closer ""La Collectionneuse"", she whispers close to your ear like a sultry grim reaper. The subject matter subverts her inherent sensuousness, but this is still Charlotte Gainsbourg singing-- at times, she can't help sounding like the cooing French goddess her father helped popularize. It's dead sexy, reborn.</p></div>"|13878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13878-irm/|8.4|Ryan Dombal

It's the basic tenet that accounts for the entire karaoke industry, the success of <i>Rock Band, </i>and the never-ending career of Rod Stewart-- though, naturally, the enjoyment one derives from singing their favorite songs is often inversely related to an audience's desire to hear them do it. Still, that hasn't stopped countless artists from resorting to the all-covers album when they find themselves at a career crossroads or in search of renewed inspiration. When executed effectively-- through savvy song selection, inventive rearrangements, and authoritative vocal performances that allow the singer to reclaim the song as their own-- the all-covers album can introduce veteran artists to new audiences (Johnny Cash's <i>American Recordings</i> series), open up new avenues for future exploration (Nick Cave's <i>Kicking Against the Pricks</i>), or deconstruct an enigma (David Bowie's <i>Pin Ups</i>). For the most part, however, they just feel like a private, practice-space indulgence that didn't really need to become a public commodity.</p>
<p>Supergrass are at an all-covers-album point in their careers-- with 16 years and six studio albums under their belts, the band have experienced a gradual side down the UK charts in recent years (with 2008's <i>Diamond Hoo Ha </i>barely cracking the Top 20), and now exist in that middle-aged purgatory between <i>NME</i> buzz band and <i>MOJO</i> lifetime-achievement award recipients.<span> </span>They're also entering this decade as independent recording artists, following a split from long-time label Parlophone/EMI. So you can totally understand founding members Gaz Coombes and Danny Goffey (with producer Nigel Godrich in tow) wanting to cast those uncertainties aside and get back to where they once belonged via their all-covers project the HotRats. But what seems like a perfectly swell concept for a surprise gig at the local pub-- where sloshed spectators can join in on the hero worship-- feels much more suspect when reified into a permanent record.</p>
<p>For one,<i> Turn Ons</i>' song selection doesn't reveal anything we didn't already know about Coombes and Goffey-- they have and always will be dedicated pop scholars mining the historical classic-rock contiunuum, from Ray Davies and Syd Barrett to David Bowie and Roxy Music to Elvis Costello and The Cure (all of whom have signature tracks featured here). But the real problem with <i>Turn Ons</i> isn't so much the predictable sources as the fact that the HotRats don't really do a whole lot with them. The minor touch-ups heard here don't exactly constitute a bold attempt to put their own stamp on the material: the Velvet Undergrond's ""I Can't Stand It"" is given an electric-boogie boost befitting of the Velvets' 1970s glam-rock progeny, the Cure's ""Love Cats"" gets a beefed-up swing beat, while the punk-rock classics (Gang of Four's ""Damaged Goods"" and a nudge-wink, self-reflexive take on the Sex Pistols' ""EMI"") are powered by acoustic guitars instead of electric. The HotRats are most successful at transforming Squeeze's ""Up the Junction"" into a piano-ballad reverie, but such inspired gestures are outnumbered by the more ill-advised augmentations:<span> </span>a version of Roxy Music's ""Love Is the Drug"" that neuters the original's discotheque groove into sexless spasms, or an otherwise straight-forward take on Bowie's ""Queen Bitch"" that slathers on an ornate string arrangement completely at odds with the song's streetwise swagger.</p>
<p>Underscoring the ineffectuality of the exercise is the fact that Coombes mostly opts for mimicry over personal reinterpretation, adopting a brooding Jim Morrison baritone for the Doors' ""The Crystal Ship"", a deadpan Lou Reed drawl on ""I Can't Stand It"", a high-register Robert Smith wail on ""Love Cats"" and so on. Granted, there is one notable exception to <i>Turn Ons</i>' obvious curation and impersonation: an overhaul of the Beastie Boys' ""(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (to Party!)"" that liberates the song from its rap-rock foundation and recasts it as a whimsical, paisley-hued outtake from <i>The Who Sell Out</i>. But while the novelty works on the verses, it leaves Coombes unsure of what to do with the chorus, thereby sapping the song of its greatest attribute: the opportunity to shout along with the titular slogan.</p>
<p>Perhaps Supergrass' upcoming album <i>Release the Drones</i>-- due later this year-- will provide a more convincing justification for the HotRats experiment, assuming the process of reacquainting themselves with their formative influences is intended to rejuvenate the band and return them to their <i>I Should Coco</i>/<i>In It for the Money</i> heyday. But as it stands, the only real surprise with the HotRats is that they named themselves after a Frank Zappa album that has no other bearing on the proceedings. And truth be told, it actually would've been a lot more interesting to hear Coombes and Goffey try their hand at some 10-minute jazz-rock jams than another note-for-note version of ""Pump It Up"".</p></div>"|13817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13817-turn-ons/|4.0|Stuart Berman

For one, their 2008 LP reprised some songs that, though first played live by RGC, debuted on record on Low's 2007 LP, <i>Drums and Guns</i>. The differences between the versions was fascinating, as was hearing RGC release all the tension that Low so carefully maintain.  It made sense to finally document a project that had been running for a few years. And there was the added novelty of hearing Alan Sparhawk singing and playing guitar in an honest-to-god rock'n'roll band-- and the surprise of hearing him pull it off.  But the novelty is not an issue on <i>2</i>. RGC now have to justify themselves as a stand-alone act-- and fortunately, they acquit themselves just as ably as they did on their debut.</p>
<p>It's a record of sharp hooks and slick production, with several anthemic and instantly memorable choruses, all evident from the very first track. ""Hide It Away"" blends chest-beating harmonies and moments of quieter guitar jangle with the band's familiar surging 4/4 rock. It's as sweetly melodic as anything Sparhawk has written, but with unfettered, audacious confidence and a guitar solo gliding on heavy reverb-- more stumping on their campaign to become a current-day Crazy Horse. ""Your Bird"" follows up on the teeth-gritting bile of their debut with some added catchiness. And ""Working Hard"" toys with rock convention without inhabiting it completely, toning down the verses to a quieter shuffle and adding slyly nihilistic lyrics while still milking the handclaps and blue-collar guitar chug of the chorus for all they're worth.</p>
<p>While <i>2</i> may not be as consistent in mood and tone as the debut, it diversifies the band's otherwise guitar-dominated sound in the album's second half. The strum of a banjo adds texture to the distorted chords of ""White Wolf"". Cello is used on two songs, the epic eight-minute reach-for-the-cheap-seats of ""Electric Guitar"" and the following comedown of the Low-like closing track ""Bless Us All"". a song marked by acoustic plucking, choral harmonies. ""Something's Going to Break"" goes all the way into using studio as instrument, sounding both muffled and feral in its first two minutes before abruptly shifting into the heaviest head-down riff of the record. The resulting explosions are still the band's <i>raison d'être</i>.</p>
<p>But if <i>2</i> is slightly more dynamic, it isn't a dramatic departure from the debut, which the band nods to in its bone-simple title (another tweak on rock convention) and in the similarity between the album covers. What you see is what you get here, and while this record is as hard and heavy-- sometimes more so-- <i>2</i> bears all the slow, subtle refinement of Sparhawk's better-known projects. Slowly getting better at what you do isn't the most exciting story ever told, but it's one that has yet to get old.</p></div>"|13841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13841-2/|7.3|Jason Crock
