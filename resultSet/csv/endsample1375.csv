I mean,
    they're always pleasant, catered affairs, and the chance to hobnob
    with a star-studded crowd of washed-up mourners like Lou Reed and
    Iggy Pop is undeniably great, but David never actually shows up.
    Critics have tried to write him off for more than a decade, and
    his work has been mostly sub-par even longer.  But somehow, some way,
    he's managed to scrape together enough of the old Bowie charm on
    every release to keep alive the hope that he might just have one
    final hurrah left in him.  Unlike some of his contemporaries (I'm
    looking at you, Iggy), he might, conceivably, still have a fighting
    chance.  But while everyone's busy measuring his latest work against
    the towering legacy of Ziggy and the Spiders and looking ahead to his
    next last gasp, it would be easy to overlook that <em>Heathen</em> is
    the best Bowie release in years.</p><p>
    
    But so what?  Bowie committed the unpardonable sin of being too good,
    too soon.  For an artist to produce an album as exquisitely relevant
    and inventive as <em>Hunky Dory</em> is rare, but to follow it with the
    colossus of <em>Ziggy Stardust</em>, and even <em>Aladdin Sane</em>,
    <em>Low</em>, and <em>Scary Monsters</em>-- he made genius sound so easy.
    With those first few groundbreaking albums, though,
    he utterly screwed himself.  The shadow of his early work will
    follow him forever, and having hit the twilight of his career after
    tripping and falling over that 1987 snot-rocket, <em>Never Let Me Down</em>,
    it has loomed larger than ever.  <em>Heathen</em> will surely be condemned 
    by those who cannot forgive him for his past greatness, and will likely
    be loved by a few who still imagine strains of ""Space Oddity"" beneath
    its refrains.  It's hard to shake the thought that even thirty years
    later, some people still seem to be expecting another <em>Ziggy</em>.</p><p>
    
    Yet <em>Heathen</em> doesn't herald a second coming for David Bowie--
    not by a longshot.  The youthful urgency of his early work is long
    gone.  But that hasn't stopped him from making an album that is
    easily his best work since the halcyon days of faux-cockney accents
    and gender bending theatrics a la <em>Scary Monsters</em>, and that's
    good news.  Bowie seems to have finally realized that he's just been
    trying too damn hard.  Where 2000's <em>Hours</em> was a brooding,
    wrist-slitting account of Bowie's laments about growing old and
    irrelevant, <em>Heathen</em> is the sound of acceptance.  He's relaxed,
    even serene, and the songs clearly reflect this with a nonchalant
    charm reminiscent of the Bowie of old.</p><p>
    
    This is not a particularly cheery record: ""Sunday"" is a somber,
    almost sinister chant that builds into an ascending chorus of warm
    synths and percussion-- a tense, minimal remix of the best moments
    of <em>Earthling</em>, if you will.  In what will surely be the song
    most often quoted by record critics, ""Slip Away,"" Bowie muses:
    ""Some of us will always stay behind/ Down in space it's always 1982/
    The joke we always knew,"" a brief moment of smiling recognition at
    the state of his career, fans, and detractors in the wake of his past
    glory days.  Gorgeous and sad, it evokes the simplicity of the past
    as Bowie sings of ""sailing over Coney Island"" to a lone piano melody
    and a compelling Moog-y electronic refrain.</p><p>
    
    ""Slow Burn"" is the strongest of Bowie's original material on
    <em>Heathen</em>-- a moody, bouncy piece with a bass/sax combo
    that vaguely elicits a 60s pop undercurrent with guitar work from
    Pete Townshend (yeah, that Pete Townshend!).  Townshend's help
    here is appreciated, mostly because it means the guitar isn't
    being played by Reeves Gabrels.  If Bowie had considered bringing
    him in earlier, he could have avoided the horror of a car crash
    like <em>Hours</em>' ""The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell.""
    Fortunately, Townshend's guitar noodling never steps into the realm
    of being entirely gratuitous, and as with all the best songs on
    <em>Heathen</em>, Bowie's vocals are wisely left to dominate.</p><p>
    
    But oddly, it's the covers that are truly the highlight of the album.
    Bowie tries his hand at the Pixies' ""Cactus"" (a move which might make
    the album's title sound ironically appropriate)-- but take a deep breath.
    Everything's going to be okay.  Mercifully, he handles the song very
    faithfully, and actually does it justice.  He's a far cry from Black
    Francis, but Bowie's voice is so amazingly distinctive that it almost
    sounds like a different song.  He then moves on to Neil Young's ""I've
    Been Waiting for You.""  I don't know what's caused the current rash of
    Neil Young covers lately, but at least Bowie's old enough to make this
    sound a little more natural than most might.  Bowie hasn't touched
    rock 'n' roll like this in years, and that he can still carry it off
    this well is a pleasant surprise.</p><p>
<em>Heathen</em>'s <em>piece de resistance</em>, though, is the
    phenomenal cover of ""I Took a Trip In a Gemini Spaceship"" by The
    Legendary Stardust Cowboy.  Name-based alter ego issues aside, this
    song is smooth.  It's got a fast-paced electronic rhythm to quicken
    the pulse, and dulcet tones to soothe the ear-- nothing but laid-back
    electropop fun from start to finish.  It's the kind of thing they'll
    be playing in the lounge of the International Space Station in about
    ten years or so, assuming the capsule doesn't get pimped out as an
    orbiting bachelor pad for N*SYNC or something stupid like that.</p><p>
    
    Bowie is obviously never going to recapture his trend-setting finesse
    of yesteryear, but at least he seems okay with that.  And that's this
    record's greatest strength.  Back when he was busy reminding everyone
    how out of it he really was by touring with Trent Reznor, he started
    to play ""The Man Who Sold the World"" and I actually heard a kid,
    maybe only two years younger than me, say, ""Oh, cool.  He's covering
    a Nirvana song.""  If that's not a warning sign, I don't know what is.
    Yes, David, the music world is moving on without you, but you can't
    end things with <em>Heathen</em>-- some of us, myself included, are
    still waiting for that final blaze of glory.  Before you go, you've
    got to let the kids know what they missed out on.</p></div>"|882.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/882-heathen/|7.8|Eric Carr

    techno/electro duo Drexciya. Which half I cannot say, because Drexciya
    has been making records for years anonymously. They do not perform out,
    obviously, and they have never identified themselves on record or in the
    press. It's long been a source of speculation in the Detroit techno community:
    Who is Drexciya? Mike Banks from Underground Resistance? An alias for retired
    auteur Derrick May? Who?</p><p>
    My personal take is, ""Who cares?"" If those guys want to keep their identities
    secret, that's fine by me. I don't much need a face to put with instrumental
    electronic music anyway, and you can count on two hands the number of producers
    with something interesting to say outside the studio. As far as I'm concerned,
    Drexciya are really a race of underwater humans descended from the pregnant
    slaves thrown overboard from slave ships, as their lore suggests.</p><p>
    My lack of knowledge about Drexciya hasn't stopped me from enjoying <em>Harnessed
    the Storm</em>, their release early this year on Berlin's purist techno label
    Tresor, and it's not going to affect my enjoyment of this record by The Other
    People Place. On this evidence, it certainly sounds like The Other People Place
    comes from the same mind as someone in Drexciya. The beats are similarly rigid,
    the synth programming is likewise rooted in early electropop, and the track
    structure walks the line between electro and techno.
    </p><p>
    Still, the differences between the projects are significant. <em>Lifestyles of the
    Laptop Cafe</em> is much more relaxed, with slow-to-mid tempos and a velvety sonic
    palette. It's almost downtempo meets techno; the beats are leisurely but stiff
    as the most uptight Kraftwerk, and they never nod in the direction of syncopation.
    There's a fair amount of weird humor here, too. ""Eye Contact"" has a recurring
    sexual grunt serving as a riff and contains a monologue featuring a latte-slurping
    narrator suffering from ""transmitter overload"" as he spies a gorgeous babe in the
    cafe, all delivered in a tone like Barry White if he suffered from autism. ""Running
    from Love"" brilliantly combines a frightfully deep and churning bass pattern,
    assorted high-end synth squelches, and a pinched, robotic voice saying something
    about moonlight and love.
    </p>
<p>
    But not all the vocal accents here are emotionally constipated or used for humor.
    The vocals in ""You Said You Want Me,"" though clipped and incomplete, are from the
    melodramatic Depeche Mode school, and it's chilling how well they compliment the
    melancholy piano theme that winds through the track. ""Let Me Be Me"" is straight
    Detroit techno, with 4/4 beats and cheap high-hat flourishes, but the booming
    ""let me be what I want to be"" vocal refrain ratchets up the tension.
    </p>
<p>
    This is not a record that stand up and says, ""Hey! Look at me!"" Much of the charm
    of <em>Lifestyles of the Laptop Cafe</em> comes from its subtlety. The beats, sounds
    and attitudes are muted and expertly designed.  Where it came from, we may never
    know, but whoever put this thing together knows what (s)he is doing.
    </p>

Perennially overshadowed by its big brother Minneapolis in the Twin Cities
    tag-team, St. Paul is the jelly to Minneapolis' peanut butter, having to constantly remind tourists and
    map makers that it hasn't been swallowed up by its neighbor to the west.  Sure, all the nice people I
    know from Minnesota insist that St. Paul is where the <i>real</i> action is, but I'm not convinced that
    all the little St. Paulians don't harbor a serious inferiority complex against their conjoined sibling.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps it's that very psychological scar that has St. Paul's The Selby Tigers so darn hoppin' angry.
    After all, at one point on this record, singer/guitarist Nathan Grumdahl simultaneously boasts and pleads
    that ""this is an underground town, underground and secret at best!""  Of course, since the Tigers don't hail
    from the nouveau garage rock capitals of Detroit, NYC, or, uh, Sweden, it's understandable that they might
    be a bit defensive about the humble Midwestern setting for their own carport jams (even going so far as
    to namedrop St. Paul's illustrious Selby Avenue in their bandname).  To compensate for this
    geographic handicap, the band's gotta strum them guitars just a little bit harder, kick up the drumbeat
    just a little bit faster, and make their album sound just a little more raggedy.</p><p>
    
    Which is pretty much what the Selby Tigers do on their second album, <i>The Curse of the Selby Tigers</i>.
    And I dare say they throw down the rawk pretty well.  Like most bands of the gee-rage scene (by my Warhol
    watch, now on it's 11th minute), the Tigers owe a lot more to late-70s punk than to the Count Five and
    ""Mony Mony,"" and with their male/female vocal dynamic, one often expects them to start chanting ""Johnny
    hit and run Pauline"" at any moment.  Hey, these kids are even married, and the marital vibe gives them a
    torn-jeans leg up on their peers, with Grumdahl's snotty punk vox clashing lovingly against spouse Arzu
    Gokcen's gallant attempts to critically injure her vocal cords.</p><p>
    
    Such beautiful punk-rock chemistry is absolutely necessary to deliver a song like ""Punch Me in the Face
    (With Your Lips)"" with the proper amount of gutter romance (does St. Paul have gutters?).  Grumdahl and
    Gokcen have obviously perfected the ancient art of Fleetwood Mac-itude, giving each of their songs that
    ""are they singing about each other?"" edge that makes for delightfully uncomfortable listening.  Not that
    their songs are all valentine hearts and candy boxes; a wide variety of topics are covered lyrically.
    ""Cheerleading Is a Big Business,"" for instance, features the telling line, ""All the jocks WOAH kitzo
    kitzo!"" or... something.  Okay, so the lyrics are kind of hard to discern, but you don't exactly look for
    Dylan in a group like this.</p><p>
    
    Generally, the Selby Tigers' one-take-and-print-it, rumble-bass, surfy-drums, spit-on-the-microphone, dive
    bar soundtracks are above average (say, 70th percentile).  The band even genuinely hits the jackpot once with
    ""Down in Uppertown"" and its ominous ""roll with me tonight"" pre-chorus bridge.  Conversely, they also hit the
    crap-pot twice with the cutesy irony-overkill of ""The Prom I Never Had"" and a failed attempt at scariness
    on ""Neighbor with a Defect.""  Everything else is unsurprising but agreeable jump-up-and-down music, great
    for working those quads and bothering the financial consultants downstairs.  If they complain, just tell 'em
    you're helping some St. Paulians wrestle with their subconscious feelings of neglect and inadequacy.  They'll
    understand.</p></div>"|7064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7064-the-curse-of/|6.4|Rob Mitchum

    the United States. Coincidentally, it's also the only art form to have died
    entirely within the United States. Following the birth of jazz in the early
    part of the 20th century, the genre hit its stride during the 40s, 50s and
    60s. Although traditional jazz had faded by the 70s, it still had Herbie,
    Miles and others innovating and developing fusion and funk. But by the 80s,
    funk was all-licked out, and jazz appeared to be on life support.</p><p>
    
    Zorn and his cohorts managed to draw new life and new sounds from the genre
    in the NYC underground of the 1980s, but smooth jazz pulled the plug clean
    out as far as the mainstream world was concerned.  Led by Dave Koz, Kenny G,
    Spyro Gyra, David Sanborn, and other assorted white people, its soothing,
    inoffensive approach made for a peaceful, if undignified death for jazz
    music's public acceptance.  Workaday music unenthusiasts were so entranced
    that they failed to even notice its passing.  But one look at <i>DownBeat</i>,
    or one glance at the jazz section in your local Tower, and you knew-- jazz
    as we once knew it was through.  Finished.</p><p>
    
    What defined the new crap was also the clever adjective that described it:
    smooth. In order to reach the desired level of smoothness, each artist aimed
    for perfect equilibrium. Every musical element lent to a delicate balance,
    and the idea of extending oneself from that balance was strictly verboten.
    Each instrument was always to be locked-in, locked-down, and airtight. The
    ideal result was flawlessness in execution. The nasty side effect was
    remarkable inanity.</p><p>
    
    Hip-hop producers The Herbaliser's newest release, <i>Something Wicked This
    Way Comes</i>, doesn't nearly approach the sins of smooth jazz, but their
    shortcomings are similar. The Herbaliser, like smooth jazz, is clearly in
    the game to pump out product of the baby's-butt variety. They feature a
    polished, precise production approach that delivers exactly what it promises--
    near flawlessness. Unfortunately, organizing pieces into common and predictable
    templates, and utilizing familiar, hackneyed hooks and grooves is more often
    than not a pretty boring idea.</p><p>
    
    Loose, buttery R&amp;B; basslines drive this disc, with simple breakbeats and a cast
    of blaxploitation- and disco-era accoutrements (including string/horn sections,
    harpsichords, vibraphones, mellotron, and that old standby, scratched upon porno
    percussion) tossed in to add some 'flavor.'  The grooves are solid enough, and
    occasionally pretty fierce-- ""The Turnaround"" borders on New Orleans funk,
    and yep, it's awfully tight.  And on a few tracks, MCs show up to rhyme, ranging
    in success from the hot (""Time 2 Build"" [feat. Blade] and ""It Ain't Nuttin'""
    [feat. MF Doom]), to the merely passable (""Verbal Anime"" [feat. Iriscience of
    Dilated Peoples, as well as an illogical chorus]), right down to pure gag-me
    putrous (""Good Girl Gone Bad"").</p><p>
    
    But at the end of the day, <i>Something This Way Comes</i> fails to distinguish
    itself. The beats are just fine, but they lack the risk or innovation that could
    potentially make them truly engaging. Moreover, it's old music; every beat on
    here is something you've heard before, be it in a bad 70s flick, a New Orleans
    jazz club, or your own hip-hop collection.  In fact, there's little on the disc
    that can't be supplanted with a spicier funk or jazz collection.  No, those
    records might not boast today's hottest and hippest underground MCs, but they
    aren't bogged down with wack 1997isms, either.  I'm just sayin'.</p></div>"|3831.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3831-something-wicked-this-way-comes/|7.0|Brad Haywood

    of your walkthrough.  Start in the contemporary art rooms and move through four-hundred-plus years of
    Individual Masters, then a long ways back to the rooms showcasing ancient pieces. You can work up a pretty
    good bummer realizing how you're forced to herald the lone, rare Singular Geniuses, only to end up looking
    at treasures made by anonymous members of communities in which most people were artisans of some kind,
    capable of at least perfunctorily creative craftsmanship. If you're in the right pissy, generalizing
    mood, you can wonder if we slather over Geniuses out of a kind of guilt because they tap into something that
    we deep-down know shouldn't be so rare. Since most of us can barely figure out how to feed ourselves, we
    jump at the chance to applaud anyone with some leftover specialness. The whole mess is enough to make you
    tired of the accidental fascism of Geniuses filling supposedly organic 'leadership vacuums,' offering us
    chances to confirm our inferiority as we stand in the crowd at their concerts, or go to their movies, or
    read their books, viewing our consumption of them as sufficiently sophisticated and 'artistic' enough to
    justify the rest of our afternoon's being spent playing video games or bitching at our sex-pals or staring
    at the ceiling or crying into our cans of Surge.</p><p>
    
    Okay, that kneejerk theory is stoops: I know that 'the people' aren't going to rise up from quoting Aflac
    commercials to start an artistic revolution, and even if it did happen I bet I'd sleep through the best
    parts. Even back-burner geniuses have consistent work ethics. Plus, those shangri-la ancient art-cultures
    probably didn't have access to convenient toilets of every personality-reflecting color. Alls I'm saying
    is that we gotta practice moderation and stop demanding that every album announce an Elvrum or Mangum or
    Yorke. As soon as you ease up on the need for a new disposable Jesus to mimic, you realize that there's a
    lot to be said for the refreshing geniuslessness of bands like Silkworm.</p><p>
    
    Silkworm has no star to fantasize about sleeping with.  No dominating image or attitude emerges to influence
    your hairstyle. The lyrics never leave you throttled by the image of them being read out of a Damn-I'm-Clever
    Notebook #47. Instead of life-affirming passion, their albums, <i>Italian Platinum</i> gloriously included,
    offer subtle slapstick nihilism. Their website makes several references to how shocked they are that they
    still exist, and it dubs their own discography ""shit we have shat."" Their concert journals humbly acknowledge
    that their slippery fit-rock is often incidental music for drunks to fidget and commingle to. Maybe the
    Genius thing is a factor in sustainability; it's hard to listen to what Pavement and Silkworm were doing
    ten years ago and conclude that Silkworm would outlast the other. They get overlooked as old-guard
    almost-weres, but an elite armada of folks with extensive CD budgets remain rightfully grateful for their
    unambitious clamor.</p><p>
<i>Italian Platinum</i>, whose packaging is so minimal that it's a waste of paper, is the band's best release
    since 1996's whoopass and splashy <i>Firewater</i>, though it just sounds like uninviting racket the first
    time you hear it, and it continues <i>Firewater</i>'s preoccupation with alcohol.  In other words, if
    <i>Firewater</i> is their <i>OK Libations</i>, this disc is their <i>Kid AA</i>-- slightly more penitent and
    therefore a great soundtrack for a punitive post-hangover jog. Anyone who has ever dropped a bottle opener
    and then broken their finger trying to get it out from behind the fridge will appreciate ""Bourbon Beard"" and
    its sloshy, regretful counterparts.</p><p>
    
    Coach Albini once again corroborates their convulsive assault, micing the guitars and vocals warmly, while
    the bass and drums maintain his standard warplane-hangar dynamics. The sound is earthily underscored by all
    manner of piano, organ, clavinet, and synthy touches, as well as guest vocalist Kelly Hogan's counterintuitive
    heartthroat. Silkworm brings the chops, working odd pauses into their solos like J. Mascis undergoing
    physical therapy. Riffs abound, some Kirk Hammett fretfests go down, and whammy bars occasionally peer out
    to inspire air-guitarists everywhere. The abundance of classic tropes (axe histrionics, anthemic refrain
    buildups, epic breakdowns, backup 'bops' and 'oohs') will leave you trying to gauge the band's sincerity.
    Are they spoofing what's been done to death, or nominating themselves as deserving candidates to give the
    oft-resurrected rock horse a respectful, hellacious kick?</p><p>
<i>Italian Platinum</i> is a slow-burner, an acquired taste, like, uh, Pawpaw's hard liquor. It grew on
    everyone I know who was in proximity to multiple spins, reducing several of them to murmuring choruses from
    hits like the opener ""(I Hope U) Don't Survive,"" the retro shoutalong ""The Old You,"" the no-wave ""The Brain,""
    the pollution-happy hoedown ""Dirty Air,"" and the clunkily-titled but killer ""A Cockfight of Feelings,"" a
    mud-puddle reminder that the verse-chorus-verse formula can be a lil' abstruse. Even the subdued, repetitive
    ""Moving,"" which is about moving in the unmetaphorical way that the Go-Gos' ""Vacation"" was about vacations,
    colonizes your tune-lobe. If only radio switched to an all-scab format, Silkworm's lurch-and-bounce could be credited
    for embracing the obvious throb of concise garage-prog-- a style you could call, to quote one of this
    album's few bombs, ""world-proof.""</p></div>"|7157.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7157-italian-platinum/|7.9|William Bowers

    nite singer/songwriter, every floundering teenage garage band, every
    greasy-locked techie with an expensive computer and a synthesizer,
    and every 17-year-old streetcorner rapper is (unless blindly
    idealistic or the child of a record tycoon) familiar with the
    obstacles lying between the practice space in their parent's basement
    and a reasonable facsimile of a musical career-- much less a cover
    shot on a glossy magazine, a slot on MTV's <em>Cribs</em>, or a
    Pitchfork rating of 7 or higher.  Suffice it to say that merely
    putting out an album on a recognized label, if you're a 19-year-old,
    rock-inclined female from South Carolina, indicates some pretty
    serious odds-beating.</p><p>
    
    For Tami Hart, however, the accomplishment of her excellent, eclectic
    2000 debut, <em>No Light in August</em>, was very near improbable. She
    offered an idiosyncratic interpretation of Northwest-inspired rock
    with a kind of skill and emotional maturity exceptionally rare for a
    songwriter still in her teens.  The album earned her considerable
    critical accolades, a handful of recognized musicians to play cameo
    roles on her future releases, and great expectations for her next
    release.</p><p>
    
    What's impressive about <em>What Passed Between Us</em> is that, in the
    two years following <em>No Light in August</em>, Hart's craft has
    progressed to a level that disallows the few flaws of her original
    output.  She still mines the same Nirvana-meets-Team Dresch aesthetic
    for her uptempo rock numbers. But with a supporting cast featuring
    The Gossip's Beth Ditto and labelmate Sarah Dougher, Tami Hart has
    expanded her repertoire to include note-perfect fractured guitar pop,
    acoustic ballads, eerie C&amp;W-tinged; tunes, and messy rock and roll.</p><p>
    
    The driving guitars of opener ""Complication"" are reminiscent of
    <em>No Light in August</em>'s furor, with a more complicated rhythmic
    sensibility.  Hart's vocals take on a different tone with the changing
    character of the songs.  She restrains that throaty yowl for the
    Go-Gos-inspired ""To the Editor""-- almost a dance song, complete with
    pop harmonies in the chorus.  These dynamic changes in style, met
    with considerable ability by Hart, indicate an impressive degree of
    proficiency in her craft.  The hard-edged ""On Your Houses"" pushes
    through distorted staccato choruses and resolves into softness as
    Hart sings, ""Look at you, where are your friends now?"" before she
    returns it to its original form.</p><p>
    
    There's something to be said for an artist who can deliver such a
    seamless, shameless homage to her influences. The raucous ""Trapped in
    Your Blood"" is one of the more pitch-perfect <em>Dirty</em>-era Sonic
    Youth ripoffs I've heard-- she even goes so far as to emulate Kim
    Gordon's vocal style.  The album's best moment, however, is the
    haunting guitar pop of ""From Chapel Hill.""  Showing shades of
    Sleater-Kinney, it's a subtle piece about unrequited love, undercut
    by discordant harmonies and a super-tight drumline. This style of
    music comes so naturally to Hart, she makes it sound unique without
    the nearly eclipsing presence of her influence.</p><p>
    
    That being said, there are problems here. Hart's eclectic sensibility
    is unquestionably an asset, but the dramatic shifts from song to song
    are a little uncomfortable at times.  Like many young musicians, Hart
    seems remarkably energetic and prolific. Trying on a lot of musical
    hats is normal, and naturally, some aren't going to fit.  The airy
    ""Head in the Clouds"" is boring and typical, likewise ""If You Were a
    Judge.""  Both are well-executed, but drag after the more crystalline
    moments on the album.  I'm inclined to be forgiving, though-- I mean,
    21 years old?  It would be an extraordinary accomplishment for
    someone 31 or 41 years old.  The audacity and energy afforded Hart by
    her age keeps things from getting too dry, and broadly hints at what
    I can only suspect are greater things to come.</p></div>"|3750.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3750-what-passed-between-us/|8.0|Alison Fields

Because right now, at this very moment, some young hipster type is lounging
    around his parent's basement, draped in a smoking jacket, drinking his Pale Ales, stroking his soul patch,
    awash in the glow of some thrift-store blacklight, and not only listening to Kylie Minogue, but enjoying it.
    And chances are (depending on just how hip our hypothetical neo-beatnik may or may not be), he doesn't even
    realize it.  Meanwhile, the Kid can't stop chuckling.</p><p>
    
    The West Coast's foremost electronic trickster's latest effort abandons the schizophrenic rhythms of
    <em>Down with the Scene</em> and the ramshackle noize of <em>Don't Sweat the Technics</em> in favor of hardcore,
    straight-up, knock-'em-down gabber beats, twisted jungle, and rapid-fire drum-n-bass. But no one will pay
    attention to any of these stylistic differences, for <em>The Action Packed Mentallist Brings You the Fucking
    Jams</em> offers a gimmick that just can't be beat.</p><p>
    
    See, in this fast-paced, ever-changing world, it turns out that imitation is no longer the sincerest form of
    flattery.  These days, it's theft.  Ever on top of the latest trends, Kid606's latest, the second release
    from the copyright infringing Violent Turd imprint, is comprised mostly of other people's songs.  New wave
    classics and contemporary pop radio standbys all get tossed in the blender for this outing, meaning Eminem
    trainwrecks into the Buggles, the Bangles walk like an Egyptian alongside A-Ha, Missy gets her freak on with
    Jay-Z... and it goes on like this!</p><p>
    
    The idea's a good one, even if it isn't his.  While everyone was busy arguing over how file-trading would(n't)
    affect record sales, the easy access it provided to both copywritten music and to easy-to-use,
    free-to-download software has inadvertently been forging a whole new style of computer music.  Garnering
    the attention of big-time pundits like <em>Spin</em> and the <em>Post</em>, this online 'bootleg' revolution
    sees software savants mixing two disparate, copywritten pop songs into one new seething mutation.  If you
    haven't heard Conway's ""Smells Like Missy Elliot"" or The Freelance Hellraiser's ""Just Can't Get Enough
    Pills,"" then put this review on hold and hop right over to <a href=""http://boomselection.n3.net"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://boomselection.n3.net</a>
    right this minute, skippy.  This stuff's brilliant, albeit in the trashiest, most lo-fi way imaginable.
    But never one to be left out in the cold, Kid606 set his sights on ripping off the rip-off artists.  Earlier
    this year, he slapped together his own take on the phenomenon, a compilation of tweaked Missy Elliott tracks
    titled <em>FreakBitchLickFly</em>.  It marked the first release from Violent Turd, a label whose operation he
    swears he has nothing to do with.</p><p>
    
    But <em>The Action Packed Mentallist</em> takes things a step further-- embracing hardcore, jungle and gabber
    techniques, and applying them to a wider array of source material than last time around. ""MP3 Killed the
    Radio Star"" applies a booty-bulging four-to-the-floor aesthetic and some bluesy harmonica to a sped-up
    acapella from D12's ""Purple Pills"" before ramming head-on into a jungle-infused version of the Buggles
    track its title parodies.</p><p>
    
    ""Never Underestimate the Value of a Holler (Vipee-pee mix)"", serves both as the obligatory take on ""Get Ur
    Freak On,"" and the album's centerpiece.  It starts with a glitchified Missy/Timbaland skewering set to a
    pulsing jungle rhythm, slows down for an expanded instrumental section, then sidetracks while the Kid
    fixates on the phrase, ""Copywritten, so don't copy me.""  For a minute or so, he manipulates this phrase,
    finally making a beat out of the phrase ""copy me"" before driving into an abyss of sheer digital noise.  He
    never quite resurfaces.  Instead, he takes the next ten minutes to slice and dice the noise with bits of
    Eminem, Jay Z's ""Big Pimpin',"" A-Ha's ""Take on Me"" and a few other sources too ubiquitous to mention.  The
    results are one of the strongest arguments for the strengthening of fair use laws I've ever heard-- not to
    mention hilarious, irritating, unsettling, and yes, pretty damned brilliant.</p><p>
    
    The rest of the album is somewhat less inspired. ""Kiddy Needs a New Pair of Laptops"" barely touches any of
    its source material.  The female R&amp;B; melodies that open the track seem almost totally unaltered, aside from
    some weird beats and tones thrown on top. The track ends with a take of the Bangles' ""Walk Like an Egyptian""
    with some bulging bass and looped drums thrown in, with the whole mess run through some DSP filters. I
    suppose it's entertaining, but I doubt it took more than a few hours to throw together.  ""This Is Not My
    Statement"" is a barbershop-quartet rendition of Radiohead's ""Creep,"" with a whole bunch of stuttering hard
    drive sounds on top.  Not only do the two never match, they never seem to interact, and the piece as a whole
    fails to reach whatever destination it had in mind.  ""Smack My Glitch Up"" barely manipulates Kylie Minogue--
    after a minute or so of DSP-garbled synthlines, there's little more than a few extra beats to distinguish
    it from straight-up Kylie.  It sounds more like one of those no-name remixes that always pollute those $5
    maxi-CD singles than it does California's patron saint of violent glitchery.</p><p>
    
    So is <em>The Action Packed Mentalist</em> a great conceptual 'fuck you' to the musical elitists of the world?
    Or is it little more than the hyperpaced, yet mostly lazy masturbation of a secret pop addict?  Probably a
    little of each.  What's brilliant is that Kid606 is far too smart to let on, even if he does offer some
    clues.  The disc is bookended with a few minutes of minimal digital static, quiet crackles and tiny little
    pops on either side. Maybe it's there just to fuck with those listeners who come in expecting a
    jukebox-smashing rollercoaster of a ride from start to finish. But I suspect that there may be more to it
    than that. These chunks of noise sound, to me, like a subtle homage to the electroacoustic composers--
    folks like John Oswald, Bob Ostertag and Marc Tremblay-- who were stealing from others and recontextualizing
    their music (also without permission) decades before anyone had ever heard the words Internet, Tigerbeat or
    Glitch.</p><p>
    
    Or maybe this, too, is part of the joke.  Maybe Kid606 is sitting at home smirking at the idea that anyone
    would use words like 'conceptual' to describe this record.  After all, the guy is a notorious prank-artist,
    and this all does seem like one big prank. While I'm eager to call him lazy for his minimal reworking of
    most of these songs, I can't help but wonder if this is the very punchline.  Despite tossing around names
    like Throbbing Gristle, Steve Reich and Coil in interviews and press releases, something tells me he wouldn't
    make an album like this if part of him wasn't a closeted pop fanatic.  Every time I get to the most mainstream,
    un-fucked-with parts of <em>The Action Packed Mentallist</em>, I can't help but think of the Kid, his face red,
    tears running down his cheeks, gasping for air, laughing harder now than ever.</p></div>"|4409.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4409-the-action-packed-mentallist-brings-you-the-fucking-jams/|7.0|David M. Pecoraro

    number of creative ills with which to humble the ancient Egyptian
    tyrant Pharaoh, as documented in Dreamworks' 1998 blockbuster
    <em>Prince of Egypt</em> (in addition to a book called The Bible).
    God's first two plagues were creative masterpieces: first you had the
    Rivers of Blood, which were supremely gross.  Then, avoiding a
    sophomore slump, God brought massive pain with the second and ickiest
    of the plagues, the Swarm of Frogs.  Fear the Swarm of Frogs!</p><p>
    
    God quickly discovered that frogs, although annoying, were not quite
    annoying enough to break the will of the hard-hearted Pharaoh.  So
    that's when he pulled out the motherfucking gnats.  Yeah, gnats.  The
    gnats managed to make both man and beast itch, including Pharaoh, who
    was duly annoyed.  But again, not annoyed enough.  Slowly, God turned
    gnats into boils (side note: I would have given in at boils), boils
    into locusts, locusts into darkness, and finally, darkness into the
    King of All Plagues-- that weird wind thing that swept through
    Egypt, killing all first-born children. Now we're talkin' plagues!</p><p>
    
    Although not documented in animated movies or religious text, God
    stuck with the last plague as the plague of choice for future
    generations.  The most famous of those plagues, of course, was the
    aptly titled Bubonic Plague, aptly titled because 'bubonic' should
    be a synonym for 'awesome.'  The Bubonic Plague was a very dangerous
    disease that spread rapidly and caused many deaths at a number of
    points in history.  The first records of the plague document the
    disease as wiping out Athens in 430 B.C., then later slaying 5000 a
    day in Rome in 262 A.D.  But the plague never gained its full nasty
    stature and nasty nickname, The Black Death, until it crushed Europe
    in the 1300s, killing a full quarter of the population. So much for
    the Swarm of Frogs.</p><p>
    
    Although modern agriculture has minimized the threat of Swarms of
    Frogs, and modern medicine the threat of most rapidly communicable
    fatal diseases, it remains that we, the music fans of the 21st
    century, have a plague of our own.  Our plague-- like the historical
    plagues of yore-- torment, vex, annoy and trouble.  Our plague is
    uniform and predictable, attacking with the same methodic formula,
    overburdening us with sonic monotony, and annoying us with puerile
    lyricism under the guise of deeply affected emotion. Our plague
    attacks with a cunning ruse, purporting to offer a more profound
    aesthetic than radio rap-rock.  But be ye not fooled!  Fact is, this
    stuff is simply Bizarro world rap-rock.  It's just as thin, just as
    commercially driven, and just as boring.  Moreover, it has spread
    quickly, and Liars Academy is proof.</p><p>
    
    If you like The Promise Ring and The Get Up Kids, you'll appreciate
    knowing that Liars Academy does, too.  From start to finish, <em>No News
    Is Good News</em> unwittingly plays up the stereotype of pestilence;
    formulaic, overdriven guitars, punkish rhythms, and candy-sweet
    proto-melodies, driving home typically emotive lyrics.  They execute
    their boredom well, playing as tight as you would expect for pop
    music's unpopular alter ego.  But alas, the bottom line is this: it
    blows, and blows badly.  Buy it and you will seal your own fate,
    ordaining yourself an emo connoisseur as you dig deep into the bins
    of filth. You may not die, but you may wish you had when you see what
    it does to your wardrobe.</p></div>"|4768.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4768-no-news-is-good-news/|0.6|Brad Haywood

It was time off
    from school and homework and structure, time to get all dirty and
    pretend you were something you weren't-- like a pirate or an
    astronaut or Optimus Prime or something.  Those really were the days,
    I guess.  These days, it's summer and I have to go spend eight hours
    of my day in a climate-controlled building, staring at a computer and
    making copies.  Ah, but such is life.  You need shelter overhead, after
    all.</p><p>
    
    It's a fair bet to say that Ash probably have all the shelter they need
    by now-- they've been massively popular in the UK ever since they first
    rocketed out of Northern Ireland with <em>Trailer</em>, back before
    they were even out of high school.  Maybe it's just the fact that
    they achieved fame so early in life, but Ash seem now like a band
    caught between youth and adulthood.  They're full of introspection
    and nostalgia lately, but the impetuousness that made their early
    records so enjoyable still burbles to the top on a pretty regular
    basis.</p><p>
    
    It's a dichotomy of ideals that makes their latest full-length--
    their second as a quartet and fourth overall-- a compelling listen,
    if a seemingly contradictory one at times.  Ash finally seem to have
    gotten around to growing up some, but the maturity of a song like
    ""Walking Barefoot"" actually suits them well, especially when it's
    countered with some solid looks over the shoulder at a time when the
    'punk' was the louder half of the band's punk-pop equation.  </p><p>
    
    And frequently, the newfound polish that coats the record is actually
    advantageous-- for example, ""Candy"" is a stately tribute to a lover,
    riding on clouds of swirling strings sampled from the Walker Brothers'
    ""Make It Easy on Yourself.""  The medium tempos of ""Shining Light"" and
    ""There's a Star"" would have seemed like big shoes for this band to
    fill just a few years ago, but now they fit perfectly-- the band's
    evolution seems entirely natural.</p><p>
    
    ""Someday, we'll leave this town/ It wears us down/ We'll leave somehow/
    All its harm and all its charm/ Someday,"" Tim Wheeler sings on ""Someday.""
    I remember thinking this, too, when I was younger.  Man, I couldn't wait
    to leave my hometown and experience something that I pretty much only
    knew as 'more.'  Nowadays, I'm still eager to test out the possibilities
    of the world and see new places, but when I think of my hometown, I seem
    to place a lot more emphasis on the charm than the harm.  I go back there
    now and see all the new developments that used to be farms and forests and
    it makes me pretty sick to see how the place where I grew up is being raped
    of its rural atmosphere.  Wheeler seems to be caught in this same place on
    <em>Free All Angels</em>-- he wants to get out and see the world, but he also
    seems to understand that what he's leaving is a lot less complicated than
    what he's gravitating towards.  On ""Sometimes,"" he's pining for a
    lost love, but he's also resigned to the fact that most things aren't
    meant to last.</p><p>
    
    One of the things that's so surprising about <em>Free All Angels</em> is
    that the good-natured rocker ""World Domination,"" a song with all the
    brash bravado and tongue-in-cheek humor of their earliest material, isn't
    the only one like it.  ""Shark"" is a slamming pile-up of riffs from
    <i>Wheeler</i> and second guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, while ""Pacific
    Palisades"" is basically Jan &amp; Dean on a lot of ephedrine, replete with
    Beach Boys-esque name checks.</p><p>
    
    And then there's the classic pop of ""Cherry Bomb,"" a sweet little
    slice of Jello cut from the same wobbly mold as such classic Ash
    songs as ""Girl from Mars.""  It's followed by what's perhaps the most
    curious song on the album, the hard-grooving, lascivious ""Submission,""
    which offers a bit more of the rock star posing that ""World Domination""
    so enthusiastically spews.  Wah pedals and-- I shit you not-- orchestral
    hits spice up an already hot rhythmic stew stirred up by drummer Rick
    McMurray and bassist Mark Hamilton.</p><p>
    
    ""Wait for the summer/ It'll come 'round again,"" Wheeler sings on
    ""Pacific Palisades.""  Well that's hopeful, now, isn't it?  And
    that's kind of what I get out of this album.  Even though we may not
    be as free to take off and explore possibilities and our imaginations
    as we were when we were all younger, it doesn't mean that imagination
    is gone or those possibilities are faded-- we just need to find new
    ways to take advantage of them.  Hell, I know that's not what Ash are
    really getting at conceptually, but it makes a lot of sense, and I
    think that on <em>Free All Angels</em> they've expressed it.</p><p>
    
    Regardless of its conceptual significance, though, <em>Free All
    Angels</em> certainly works on another level.  It's a damn good pop
    album, with a little muscle behind its melodies to boot.  And no
    matter where you stand on the childhood-to-adulthood spectrum,
    that's something just about everybody can use now and then.</p></div>"|309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/309-free-all-angels/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    surface, you might think this was a new age record for the first few
    seconds.  And in some ways, you might be right.  Whatever raging,
    insistent inspiration Jim Black carries with him while playing for
    other people seems to have been merely a color effect for his owr
    music.  It's just not fair to pigeonhole Black as always being full
    of rage: his light-handed, detail-oriented playing and ability to
    make just about any kind of music interesting is one of his major
    talents.  In fact, the dense calm at the heart of his compositions
    seems to indicate that resolution, not rage, is his ultimate goal.
    So, I think an introduction is in order: meet Jim Black, drummer and
    composer.</p><p>
    
    Black was born in 1967 in Seattle.  He'd grown up playing rock and
    jazz, and eventually attended the esteemed Berklee College of Music
    in Boston.  Soon, he moved to New York City, and fell in with the
    budding downtown avant-garde jazz scene.  His first claim to fame was
    playing in Tim Berne's legendary Bloodcount unit, where he was at
    least partially responsible for the band's rather intimidating
    aggression.  Black also made the rounds with Dave Douglas, Ellery
    Eskelin, Satoko Fujii and Chris Speed.  Jim Black plays like there
    has never been a concept of tomorrow: like an ultra-precise,
    junk-cymbal and Aphex-beat loving hurricane.  I read an interview ir
    an old drummer magazine once where Black was giving props to Stewart
    Copeland and John Bonham, and I guess those are good starters, but
    they don't really account for the whole lightspeed chaotic
    behind-the-beat-even-though-he's-really-right-on-it thing he does.
    Furthermore, Copeland and Bonham weren't jazz drummers.  To my ears,
    he's near the lineage of Tony Williams-- aggressive and
    idiosyncratic, but so nimble that you never get the feeling he's
    pushing too much.</p><p>
<em>Splay</em> is Black's second solo release, after last year's
    <em>Alasnoaxis</em>, with his band of the same name.  The band ir
    question (Chris Speed on clarinet and tenor sax, Hilmar Jensson or
    guitar and Skuli Sverrisson on bass) is made of players very much ir
    Black's demographic.  These are relatively young artists who are
    knee-deep in the highbrow pit of new jazz-- yet unlike John Zorn,
    don't have to play modern rock as a genre exercise.  I'd say the
    music on this record has as much relevance in an indie discography
    (particularly one that features instrumental acts such as Tortoise,
    Chicago Underground Duo/Trio and Rovo) as it does a jazz one, at
    least on the surface.</p><p>
    
    Tunes like ""Aloe Evra"" and ""Cheepa vs. Cheep"" could probably pass for
    a jazzy brand of Chicago post-rock.  The former begins lightly, with
    a backdrop of wet ambience and modest guitar figure-- until the drums
    crash in, at which point it becomes an odd combination of MBV
    distortion, but with relentlessly crashing cymbals and up-tempo rock
    beat, and eerily contemplative chamber jazz.  Speed's clarinet takes
    the melody, and his understated tone just barely manages to keep
    aloft amongst the guitars and cymbals.  Despite the intensity (and
    density), the overarching mood is still of calm.  ""Cheepa vs. Cheep""
    starts with Jensson's heavily distorted guitar and kinetic
    polyrhythms from Black, while Speed's clarinet makes modest melodic
    statements.  In the mid-section breakdown the band first
    disintegrates into boisterous free-form cutups, only to completely
    disappear into a drone of pulsating acoustic guitar and pillowy
    synth.</p><p>
    
    Sometimes the sound can get a bit too calm, especially during the
    ballads.  ""iCratic,"" with Speed's straight-tone melody and Jensson's
    Frisell-esque watercolor comping, borders on the stationary despite
    Black's restless drumming.  The tune doesn't really start to gain any
    momentum until about two minutes in, when it coincidentally ceases
    being a ballad and turns into brooding avant-rock.  Black tests
    listener patience with the epic ""Blissed (Selfchatter Mix)"" which, at
    twelve minutes, will undoubtedly filter out all the strict jazzbos ir
    the audience.  It's basically a straight indie instrumental, for
    whatever that's worth, along the lines of very recent Fugazi or Sonic
    Youth-- reveling in those low-register guitar chords and Black's
    everyman rock beat.</p><p>
    
    If you havex92t had the pleasure of hearing Black play, I'd recommend
    starting with some of his records as a sideman (particularly with
    Ellery Eskelin or Tim Berne) before hitting <em>Splay</em>.  It's not
    that this side of his music isn't just as compelling, but those
    performances were some of the best of the 90s, whereas his solo work
    is strangely attractive, but arguably not as inventive, or immediate
    for that matter.  Nevertheless, a solid effort from one of the most
    interesting artists in contemporary jazz.</p></div>"|786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/786-splay/|7.5|Dominique Leone

    Sparks.  Nice fellers, the Sparks... and every last one of 'em thin as a rail.  Every time I see a
    32-length, 28-waist pair of cordoroy pants at a thrift store, I think about having the staff set 'em
    aside for the Sparks' Chris Gunst.  Anyway, my story dates back to the first time I saw the Sparks,
    and that was opening up for Lou Barlow back in 1997.  Only, see, there were <em>six</em> of 'em back
    then-- guitarist/vocalist Gunst, bassist Brent Rademaker, keyboardist/lap steel virtuoso ""Farmer Dave""
    Scher, drummer Tom Sanford, a guy who didn't do much that we called ""the tambourine guy,"" and a fella
    by the name of Josh Schwartz.  Schwartz, also razor-thin with a shaggy mane of fair hair, traded guitar
    and vocal duties with Gunst and wrote many of their best songs.  Hell, before the Los Angeles <em>New
    Times</em> profiled the band, I used to think they were twins.</p><p>
    
    And they were outstanding, like the missing link between Sonic Youth and Teenage Fanclub, with a chaser
    of Buffalo Springfield and your friend buying a bottle of Big Star to boot.  The Beachwoods' brand of
    country-fried space rock had a rare immediacy that commanded attention-- no one seemed to speak at their
    gigs, even when 'songs' became ten-minute sideways jams and bled into one another, setlists becoming
    insane, dazed-and-confused medleys of the best songs you'd never heard.  I roped a couple of friends into
    catching their next gig, a free show at Spaceland, and they were so enthralled we caught them every Monday
    for a month straight while the Sparks honed their chops in a brief residence there.  It was at these shows
    that we began to recognize individual songs in the band's oeuvre-- Gunst's majestic anthem ""Desert Skies,""
    and Schwartz's tripped-out ""Make It Together"" and British Invasion-flavored ""Midsummer Daydream.""  It wasn't
    for many months that we were even able to hear the recorded versions of these songs, on Bomp! Records'
    ""Desert Skies"" seven-inch-- and the results were a little disappointing.  The bombastic riff of ""Desert
    Skies"" and herky-jerky stomps of ""Make It Together"" were reasonably well-documented, but the vinyl was
    poorly pressed and the vocals-- Gunst's in particular-- sounded annoyingly twee compared to the echo-drenched
    Thurston-isms of the Beachwoods' live gigs.</p><p>
    
    So you can imagine our shock when, after many months without a Beachwoods fix, we caught the Sparks opening
    for the Lilys at the Whisky A Go-Go and, uh-oh-- they emerged wearing matching white outfits and cowboy hats,
    sans-Schwartz and with various Lilys sitting in for Pete Kinne and Tom Sanford.  The fringe-happy five-piece
    raced through a frantic, countrified version of ""Desert Skies"" and the rest of what would become 2000's debut
    album, <em>Beachwood Sparks</em>.  I was willing to cut the guys a little slack, Flying Burrito Brothers
    outfits and all, but I've gotta admit the shine was taken off once the debut was released and I'd seen a few
    more of the foursome's lackluster shows.  Beachwood Sparks were now the Chris Gunst show, and while the band
    still had many great things going for it-- strong songwriting, able musicianship, and a fond affinity for
    Gram Parsons-- the Sparks lacked the presence and energy they'd enjoyed with Schwartz, the very qualities
    that had generated all the hype in the first place.</p><p>
    
    So, after last year's well-recorded but ultimately chilly <em>Once We Were Trees</em> (a project which finally
    paired the shameless Dinosaur Jr. worshippers of Further with their hero, J Mascis), Beachwood Sparks have
    returned with a six-cut EP featuring yet another change in personnel.  Former Strictly Ballroom compadres
    Jimmy Hey and Jimmy Tamborello join the fray (as new drummer and guest collaborator, respectively), but for
    the most part, <em>Make the Cowboy Robots Cry</em> treads the same sleepy-lazy formula that made both of the
    Beachwoods' full-lengths such disappointments.  Gunst's thin, wavery vocals barely cut through the
    treble-drenched swamp of harmonica and carnival-ride organ on seven-minute opener ""Drinkswater.""  The
    equally poky ""Ponce de Leon Blues"" ambles along on a ghost of a riff, propped up by thick vocal harmonies
    and little else before collapsing into a barely-there deconstruction of the melody with acoustic guitar
    and bass and Gunst's soulless vocals.</p><p>
    
    The Sparks also use the old 'between albums EP' cliche to indulge in a little experimentation at their fans'
    expense, with little to show for the effort.  ""Hibernation"" conjures a spooky vibe, with its samples of
    dusty vinyl and distant thunderstorms courtesy of Dntel's Tamborello, before devolving into a chorus of,
    ""Will I see you again? Good, good friend,"" so impossibly high-pitched it could only have been recorded
    above a natural helium deposit.  ""Sing Your Thoughts"" employs a suitably intricate bass part to move
    Gunst's trite musical meanderings along (""Do you hear the sound of my sadness?""), but is ultimately lost
    in a soup of stuttery syntho strings and an elusive melody.  ""Galapagos"" suffers from a similar fate, with
    a rubbery bass and siren-like synth cutting abrasively through an otherwise pleasant texture of banjo and
    guitar.</p><p>
    
    The only redeeming quality of this record is its good intentions, and with results like this, even those
    are questionable.  At least <em>Beachwood Sparks</em> and <em>Once We Were Trees</em> had the fortune of massing
    more than a dozen songs on each release, spacing gems like ""You Take the Gold"" out with incidental noodling
    and mindless pop songs.  If anything, Beachwood Sparks' albums are like listening to a hit-and-miss radio
    station-- if you don't like the song that's playing now, at least you might like the next.  <em>Make the
    Cowboy Robots Cry</em> exaggerates the band's weaknesses by extending their most tepid work to date into
    mini-jams, accenting the 60s space-rock vibe with the worst of 90s pretensia, and continuing to pass off
    vocals so slight they wouldn't pass muster with Kindercore.  Beachwood Sparks' best days are certainly
    behind them, but it's disappointing so see the band stray so far in the wrong direction with each subsequent
    release.</p></div>"|599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/599-make-the-cowboy-robots-cry-ep/|2.6|Will Bryant

    alt-country band that couldn't rock a cradle.  And it's frustrating,
    because <em>Latitude</em> shows potential, not least because of the
    resumes of the frontmen: Adam Vida plays drums for aggressive
    art-noise band US Maple, and his brother Ben co-founded post-rock
    ensemble Town &amp; Country.  It's to their credit that they're attempting
    to expand their horizons with this straight-ahead project, but you'd
    expect more dynamics and better arrangements.  <em>Latitude</em>'s
    consistent, snoozy sound dampens some fine writing, covering up the
    differences between the songs instead of pushing their strengths.</p><p>
    
    The record lilts like it's going out of style.  On ""Zip Codes""-- for
    just one example-- the gentle cadence of the waltz time guides the
    quiet, pillow-like guitars and the excessive swell of the pedal
    steel.  Jason Adasiewicz' drums only occasionally knock the songs to
    life, roughening the sound with the steady thud that opens ""Leave
    Into"" or the lumbering beat behind ""So Lovely, So Lovely.""  At other
    times, the band goes out of their way to keep the momentum in check.
    On both ""Travel"" and ""Leave Into,"" they separate a big chorus from a
    stumbling guitar solo with a space of extreme quiet to make sure
    they don't build on each other.  Was there a baby sleeping nearby?</p><p>
    
    Adam Vida makes an uncomfortable frontman.  Though soft and melodic,
    his vocals aren't expressive: there's an ache in the lyrics that
    rarely comes out in his voice.  He muffles the interpretations, and
    it wasn't until I looked at the liner notes that I appreciated the
    bitterness in, say, ""Travel,"" or the themes of distance and the sad,
    simple images that populate these songs.  It's telling that the best
    cut, ""So Lovely, So Lovely,"" works by using the fatigue in Vida's
    voice as he switches from a drag-ass frustration with his life (""God
    damn, it's such a bore"") to the one line of hope (""But so lovely, so
    lovely are you"").  When he hits this chorus-- as with the simple
    phrase ""between love leaving and seeking"" that sums up ""Travel""-- the
    song finally gets the punch it deserves.</p><p>
<em>Latitude</em> needs more of that sort of impact.  On the album
    closer, ""Another Perfect Plan,"" Vida never brings out the potential
    in lines like, ""It's a lie when I deny the lovers on the side/ I
    never heard about the cancer.""  The send-off, ""I should stay out of
    town and out of touch,"" could be miserable if it didn't disappear
    into an instrumental section that just sounds like padding; the lead
    guitar turns to knotty lines behind that final verse, but your ear is
    no longer looking for it.  And ballads like ""Parallel"" and ""Famous
    Harbor"" are like sinking into the best bed you've ever slept all day
    in.  It's a soothing listen, but I recommend not listening to this
    while driving or operating heavy machinery.</p></div>"|1376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1376-latitude/|5.3|Chris Dahlen

    indie quartet hailing from Berkeley, California.  And like every phantom
    wannabe rooted out by those meddling kids, there's a man behind this
    mask: superproducer Steve Albini.  The debut LP from The Ghost,
    <em>This Is a Hospital</em>, proves a point about Albini, and it's not
    the point you think I'm going to make. For all you know, Albini is a
    total hack. He may as well be Al Bundy.  The reason?  Albini works
    exclusively with brilliance.  (Well, except Bush.  But that was for
    the cash.)  Albini may be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but
    when you're already working with sliced bread-- well, you get my point.</p><p>
    
    The Ghost may not be ""brilliance"" per se, but the seeds are certainly
    there. The quartet has been an official 'band' for just over a year
    (they played their first show in April of 2001), and they're already
    producing material twice the quality of some of their peers.  The key
    lies in their formula, which, while familiar and easy on the ears,
    is awfully difficult to pin down.</p><p>
    
    Musically, it's clear that the Ghost worships at the altar of The Rock,
    and I'm not talking about <i>The Scorpion King</i> (though it would be
    brilliant if they prayed to that guy).  The majority of <em>This Is a
    Hospital</em> blends straightforward indie rock with some jagged
    post-punk hues for a rhythmic, powerful, incisive guitar-and-bass attack.
    The vocals, however, are the hallmark of The Ghost: probably a quarter
    of the time, lead vocalist Brian Moss just flat-out screams.  And I
    don't mean that calculated, affected caterwaul his punky brethren swear
    by; I'm talking raw, shredded throat gore with damn-near judicial
    conviction.</p><p>
    
    The Ghost also distinguish themselves with some impressive songwriting.
    There are a number of mix-tape gems on <em>This Is a Hospital</em>, and
    two of them open the album: the minor key, post-punkish ""Death by the
    Bay"" and the similarly unsettled ""On and On,"" which opens with jagged
    guitars and poignant lyricism (""I fell in love every night/ How could
    I not?/ Somebody kiss me and prove me wrong""), but resolves its tension
    in the potent, poppy, chant-along chorus, ""So it goes, we've clipped our
    own wings/ My arms have become roots.""  That's horror shit, dude!</p><p>
    
    Closer ""Red Slippers Red Wheels"" begins with a bright, midtempo pop
    rhythm, cutting back to just bass and drums for the verse. Something
    about the mood seems to promise an anthem, and as the song reaches
    its peak, The Ghost delivers on that promise, first halting the track
    altogether, then bringing back the opening chords for a rousing,
    top-of-their lungs chorus: ""In this empty room/ I will live with my
    mistakes/ Hold this straw until it's gold/ It will, or I will, break."" </p><p>
    
    I don't want to oversell, though, so I'll come clean and admit that the
    middle of this disc is a bit flat.  However!  The bookends more than make
    up for any perceived deficiencies.  Besides, it's sort of an Oreo thing.
    I don't go for the chalky, jizzy center, preferring the crunchy chocolate
    punch of the surrounding cookie crisp.  You might love jizz, I don't know.
    But I do know this, and look at me when I say it to you: baby, it's your
    money.  You can put it down on a half-ton of horseshit (check eBay) or
    you can give it up for The Ghost.  It's like Velma said: ""Oh no!  MY
    GLAAAAAASSES!!""</p></div>"|3442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3442-this-is-a-hospital/|8.1|Rob Mitchum

In
    fact, at times, Microwaves sound like a good old-fashioned American
    hardcore band, but they have far too 'arty' leanings for that
    classification.  To the standard guitar/bass/drums format they add a
    fair amount of samples and other sonic wackery.  The guitar is
    brittle and trebly, the bass sounds like some kid making fart noises
    on his arm (a <i>good</i> thing in this instance, I assure you), and
    the drums are all hi-hat and cymbal.  Like their close kin in dark
    disco-punk bands like the Rapture, the Microwaves have obviously
    digested the Factory Records catalog, but they've also spent some
    quality time with Devo, Beefheart, Zappa, and most noticeably,
    MX-80 Sound, meaning they've picked up a sense of humor somewhere
    along the line.</p><p>
<em>System 2</em> begins with what sounds like a squealing, tape-eating
    Tascam battling a dusty record in-groove, panning back and forth
    between channels before the angular post-punk chaos ensues. The
    vocals alternate between the above mentioned screamo and a deadpan
    plainspeak.  The first thing you hear is, ""Every time I take a picture
    something truly horrible happens... people are dead, bloody and
    mangled,"" and later, we get some unclear, presumably nasty happenings
    ""in the back of a McDonalds.""  Most of the time, though, Microwaves
    purposefully steer clear of direct narrative, preferring to proffer
    absurdities.  And this is where the humor shines through-- if they
    played it straight and just related some tales of blood and gore
    along with frantic paced music, it would get tiring pretty quick.
    (Insane Clown Posse, anyone?)  But little spoken-word interjections
    like ""What were you thinking?"" and ""How ya doing?"" are a clue that
    these boys are feeling the irony. Do they know what kind of lunatics
    they sound like?  Is it just a big put-on?  It's hard to tell, and
    that, ultimately, is what makes <em>System 2</em> so interesting.</p><p>
    
    Microwaves' defining moment on <em>System 2</em> comes with the maddening
    final track, ""1983.""  It opens with a hyper-repetitive solo drum
    pattern that sounds like something from a Faust album, and then, just
    when you think it will <i>never end</i>, they pile on layer upon layer
    of maniacal laughter (the kind you might hear from a cartoon villain)
    and some kid repeating, ""I took a picture of blood,"" and squealing with
    delight.  The first time I listened to this I found it brutally irritating,
    but on subsequent listens found it both hilarious yet quite disturbing.</p><p>
    
    I've listened to <em>System 2</em> more than a dozen times and I can't
    believe I haven't had some sort of aneurysm yet.  I'm fairly certain
    I've now listened to it more than anyone else in the world, at least
    more than anyone not somehow associated with the band.  It isn't
    something I'd recommend doing unless you have some sadistic desire to
    inflict damage upon your nervous system, or if you're just really
    jaded.  There are albums that produce more tension and anxiety than
    this one, but not many.  I advise that you not listen to this as often
    as you visit Pitchfork (wait, maybe you're really filled with <i>all
    kinds</i> of sadistic desires!), but that instead, you just bust it
    out when you're on drugs.  No, scratch that.  Save the money you
    usually spend on meth and buy this album instead.  And don't forget to
    put a towel or something down on the kitchen floor.</p></div>"|5274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5274-system-2/|8.4|Jason Nickey

    back before they were trying so hard?  Sure, they were annoying
    little brats back in the early lo-fi days, too.  But I assure you,
    they were but a mere shadow of their current selves, irritant-wise.
    Usually, change is a positive thing for a young band, but with
    <em>On a Wire</em>, change just means putting the keyboard higher
    in the mix and shifting the schmaltz into overdrive.  Yessir,
    that's our Get Up Kids!  Back with twelve more cringe-inducing
    nasally passages that'll have you kicking your dog and praying
    for redemption.</p><p>
    
    True to form, this one's got a bunch of lyrics for kids who've
    never known real tragedy to cry to (""Don't have bruises I can show/
    Scars from abuse without a blow""), and songs named after places and
    girls (I foresee increased sales amongst people named Hannah in
    Kansas), but this album is most distinct in that, like the Promise
    Ring's leaden <em>Wood/Water</em>, it marks the completion of the
    Missouri quintet's transition out of emo and into plain ol' generic
    pop.</p><p>
    
    Of course, this kind of metamorphosis doesn't happen overnight.  Ever
    since their first LP found them an audience, the Kids have been
    moving farther away from the abrasive sloppiness of their early
    efforts (it's hard to believe that their debut was produced by
    Shellac's Bob Weston), slowly transforming into something a bit more
    user-friendly.  Painful hollering grew into hollers of pain, because
    hey, that sensitive schtick really gets the chicks!  The <em>Red
    Letter Day</em> EP showed off a bigger recording budget and a softer,
    gentler batch of songs.  And then, despite promising continued
    'development' with their subsequent move to the Vagrant label,
    <em>Something to Write Home About</em> reeked with uncertainty.  Some
    of the kids, it seemed, weren't quite ready for the big time-- and
    it came across in the songs, which teetered somewhere between the
    Kids' early underground screeching and the new, 'accessible' sound
    that by then seemed inevitable.</p><p>
    
    Well, a few screaming stadiums full of horny underaged Weezer fans
    later and the transformation is complete: <em>On a Wire has</em>
    that glossy veneer that only happens with the help of a good decisive
    manager, a fast-talking label guy with All The Answers, and that
    bloodthirsty, all-encompassing desire for yet another Big Tour.</p><p>
    
    And it'll probably work: the Kids are undoubtedly packing their bags
    as we speak to go peddle this inferior product.  Will they succeed in
    tricking the teeming masses of sweaty teenage flesh into believing
    that the occasional appearance of an acoustic guitar means maturation?
    Only those who've been ruthlessly brainwashed and tortured by the
    vacuous hype machine will care to find out!  But if I'm to continue
    to hold the least of faith in humanity, then I must suspect that
    lines like, ""Say the words so slow/ Say it without fear/ You won't
    turn to go/ You won't leave me here,"" just might be a bit too much
    to stomach-- even for Get Up Kids fans.</p><p>
    
    Now, naturally, you don't need me to tell you all this.  Chances are
    you already fall into one of two categories: people who already own
    this album, or people who know better.  Either way, you've already made
    your decision.  Which leaves me, the critic, feeling useless, rejected,
    depressed.  Hey, wait a minute.  Rejected?  Depressed?  Those are the
    kinds of things sensitive guys feel, right?  And I have a guitar right
    over there.  And I don't know how to sing.  Hot damn!  Maybe I can make

    that if a band/album can't be pigeonholed into some ridiculously named
    sub-genre, then it ceases to exist.  Naturally, when I saw that tens,
    nay, <i>dozens</i> of individuals were having trouble categorizing
    Thursday's debut CD, <em>Full Collapse</em>, I panicked.  Is it hardcore?
    No, Snapcase would come and destroy anyone who seriously attempted to
    claim that.  Is it emo?  No, instead of pointless whining, <em>Full
    Collapse</em> is full of pointless screaming.  How about 'screamo'?
    Hmm.  It does sounds like emo with the angst on overdrive, but the
    name 'screamo' is so fuckin' ridiculous, it's ridonkulous.</p><p>
    
    Not wanting to see Thursday fall to the wayside for lack of a
    classification, I consulted my good friend, Mr. Robert Stack,
    with the latest mystery I needed him to unsolve for me.
    Uncharacteristically, he provided an answer to my question
    immediately and suggested that Thursday be classified as simply
    'shit.'  And after spending some quality time with <em>Full
    Collapse</em>, I have to agree with Mr. Stack.  Thursday does a few
    things right, but all in all, this could have been a much better
    album.</p><p>
    
    These guys bring 'taking themselves too seriously' to a level few
    bands have ever even considered.  I'm all for the serious approach to
    music, but enough is enough.  When Geoff Rickly sings, ""Discard this
    message/ Throw this bottle back into the ocean/ Rip this page from
    the history books/ Smash all the street signs/ Erase all the maps/
    Forget my name, forget my face/ Because it's gonna rain, it's gonna
    rain/ And it never ends,"" on ""Paris in Flames,"" I had to stifle
    laughter.  He's got a good sense of melody, and he's trying his
    damnedest to sell this, but a little angst goes a long way-- in this
    case, out of the ballpark, over the parking lot, and into the strip
    mall with that skeezy porno store next to the donut shop.  Maybe I'm
    just not fourteen enough to enjoy this stuff anymore, but after
    having twelve tracks worth of tastelessly over-the-top melodrama
    hammered into my forebrain, I was ready to call it quits.</p><p>
    
    Even though the lyrics sound more like self-serving wankery than
    actual sincerity, Thursday's sound is a little tighter.  They tend to
    sound like At the Drive-In, but without the afros; that is, cleaner.
    For the most part, this works against the record slightly because the
    smoothness of the instrumentation and the vocals really undermines
    the intensity of the subject matter.  I'm not necessarily saying that
    the lyrics would fly if the music was a little harsher, but it
    couldn't hurt.  The energetic guitar tug-of-war between Steve Pedulla
    and Tom Keeley is sharp enough to break the skin, but it needs a
    rustier edge, a threat of tetanus.  Tucker Rule's drumming gets
    things from zero to sixty, but lacks the kidney-squeezing intensity
    from which Thursday could really benefit.  Part of the problem is
    that when the music does start to pick up, the bass and drums really
    get lost in the mix, so it's hard to tell.</p><p>
    
    The only remarkable thing about this album is the screaming.  <em>Full
    Collapse</em> has a whole lot of screaming.  Sometimes it's fun, like
    on ""Concealer"" or ""Understanding in a Car Crash,"" where it's mostly
    complementary to the vocals and doesn't end up overshadowing the music
    too much.  Most of the time, though, the music can barely support the
    intensity of Rickly's vocals, and then the screamings kick in and
    completely drown it out.  Then there are those mercifully rare moments
    (the ends of ""Hole In the World"" and ""Cross Out the Eyes"") where the
    screaming is so out of place I actually feel embarrassed for them,
    and I'm not just saying that.</p><p>
<em>Full Collapse</em> is scream-tastic, but that's about it-- it
    doesn't even stand out in its own miniscule sub-sub-genre.  There's
    better 'screamo' out there.  Check out <em>Relationship of Command</em>.
    And if you've already done that and decided that some more teen angst
    is what your world needs now, then go to it-- another sale might be
    just the thing to get Thursday to lighten up a little.</p></div>"|8054.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8054-full-collapse/|5.6|Eric Carr

    with a glass of lemonade (or Hooch) in one hand and a guitar in the
    other, he kicks back on the porch with his pals and records another
    album of jazz-informed folk and country.  This is something he's
    explored for the past few years, ever since his 1997 album
    <em>Nashville</em> (recorded with session players like Jerry Douglas,
    Viktor Krauss, and members of Alison Krauss' Union Station)
    deservedly won 'album of the year' from <em>Downbeat</em>.  He proved
    how well his own style-- the slight twang in his sustained electric
    tones, and the echoes of steel pedal guitar-- could work with this
    kind of music.</p><p>
    
    Frisell put together a touring band called The Willies, featuring
    maniac avant-fiddler Eyvind Kang, banjo fiend Danny Barnes of
    progressive bluegrass band Bad Livers, and bassist Keith Lowe.  This
    'new bluegrass' (xFC-grass?) project toured America and Europe playing
    a set of new Frisell tunes and classics like ""Cluck Old Hen"" and
    ""Sugar Baby.""  His new record documents the band, but it comes up
    short: Kang mysteriously wasn't included, leaving the other three
    Willies to pick and haw through an album that's faithful and
    accurate, yet not that adventurous.</p><p>
    
    In spite of <em>Nashville</em>'s success, Frisell's Americana phase has
    received mixed reactions: at its best it's finger-pickin' good, with
    Frisell setting up great jam sessions with top country and bluegrass
    musicians.  At its worst, Frisell plays picturesque music that's
    thick with nostalgia, an ongoing homage to ""Home On the Range"" that
    masks the edgier facets of his playing.  Some fans have complained
    that Frisell won't turn up the volume and return to his Noisy Bill
    period of the late eighties, when he was shredding across New York
    City.  But there's absolutely nothing wrong with Quiet Bill, whose
    gorgeous tone and impeccable sense of collaboration make him the
    foremost balladeers of today's jazz axemen.  His collaboration on Ror
    Miles' <em>Heaven</em>, a duet album released last month, is utterly
    beautiful: without hyperbole I can say that if my last moments or
    earth are like the music on that record, I'll know I did something
    right.</p><p>
    
    The problem here is with Cautious Bill, who spends hours in the
    studio recording and overdubbing his tracks.  The Ron Miles album,
    and albums like <em>Nashville</em> (supervised by hard-nosed producer
    Wayne Horvitz), capture performances live in the studio with minimal
    editing and overdubbing: they have the improvised feel of a
    conversation, the sense that someone caught a moment that we're lucky
    to have.  Under Lee Townsend, who produced <em>The Willies</em> and
    most of Frisell's other recent albums, the pieces sound overplanned.
    Frisell treats the pieces carefully and often reverently, forgetting
    to let them breathe.  The overdubs add color to the album (for
    example, Danny Barnes' addition of pump organ to several tracks), but
    the spontaneity is lost.</p><p>
    
    With the bluegrass standards that make up half of this album, the
    successes make the merely competent songs sound even worse.  For
    every hot track like ""Cluck Old Hen,"" with Barnes' manic runs and
    Frisell's gritty solo, there's a cover like ""Blackberry Blossom""
    that's merely pretty (the extra loops from Frisell's delay pedal are
    colorful but unnecessary). ""Goodnight, Irene"" begins with a delicate
    improvised section but settles into a plucky but conservative
    reading.  The slowed-down performance of ""John Hardy"" is a highlight;
    it explores a melody that modern players speed to a blur, and Barnes'
    extremely delicate solo is like drops of rain at an autumn funeral.
    But Frisell plays Hank Williams' ""Cold, Cold Heart"" with the eager
    faithfulness of a grade schooler reciting ""Casey at the Bat.""</p><p>
    
    Frisell introduces some good originals-- particularly ""Everybody
    Loves Everybody"" and ""If I Could I Surely Would""-- but even here, the
    methodical studio versions are outshone by live recordings that have
    surfaced from some of the Willies performances.  Their concert ir
    early 2000 at the Barbican in London has it all over this album: the
    BBC captured Eyvind Kang playing with the band, and his solo on ""My
    Buffalo Girl"" (from <em>Good Man, Happy Dog</em>) leaps out of the
    song, buys everyone dinner, has a few beers and gets laid before
    slinking back to restate the melody.  And when <em>Ghost Town</em>'s
    ""Big Bob"" segues into ""If I Could I Surely Would,"" the latter tune
    (buoyed by noisy flourishes and a breezy pace) sounds much more like
    it's riding into the sunset than the immaculately constructed studio
    version. </p><p>
    
    Nonesuch takes a coffeetable-book approach to their releases,
    favoring immaculately produced studio products: they may never
    release the Barbican show, or any other live recording from Frisell.
    In its absence, <em>The Willies</em> is servicable, but it isn't the
    shit-kicking great time that it should be.  It makes Frisell seem
    like the guy at the party who's scared to get drunk and break the
    host's furniture; and we know he has more bluegrass in him thar
    that.</p></div>"|3208.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3208-the-willies/|7.0|Chris Dahlen

It inevitably sides with your more
    impulsive self, leaving logic at the door.  Anyone who's ever gone or
    a four-night study bender will understand.  Something as perverse as
    lining every inch of your room with mirrors may seem logical at the
    time but, as the cast of the film <em>Alive</em> discovered, the
    rationale can't always be justified in the face of social scrutiny.
    However, after finding myself driving about Austin's seediest
    neighborhoods at 4:00 a.m. blasting Snow's ""Informer"" at an ungodly
    volume, even I had to admit that I had a problem.</p><p>
    
    Having been seduced by many of the myriad New Age philosophies
    blurring the lines between genuine medical practice and
    transcendentalist scam artistry, I made the decision to take leave of
    long-time friend and personal physician Dr. Schreiber and seek the
    clinical opinion of 'Hopie,' an authentic feng-shui master who
    happened to dabble in alternative remedies.  After listening intently
    to the horrors of my descent into madness, he flipped through his
    record collection. The artists I could discern from my wicker
    topple-bowl across the foyer were completely alien to me.  Nowhere ir
    my travails had I encountered musicians with such exotic names as
    Tanakh, Keiji Haino, or Tomas Jirku.  Needless to say, names of such
    foreign cadence were quite impressive while under the influence of
    Hopie's slightly inebriating incense.  When he finally prescribed a
    two-week tenure with Hrsta's <em>L'eclat du Ciel Était Insoutenable</em>,
    I felt the rare but refreshing surge of snobbery familiar only to the
    musical 'elite.'</p><p>
    
    What ensued was much less exhilarating: my research on Hrsta revealed
    that the project was merely a vehicle for Mike Moya, co-founder of
    such post-rock luminaries as Godspeed You Black Emperor and another
    personal addiction, Set Fire to Flames.  I soon discovered, however,
    that cred alone isn't enough to sustain a poorly conceived exploratior
    of dissonance.</p><p>
    
    Although my insomnia was gone, it wasn't because Moya had painted a
    gorgeous and inviting sonic tapestry capable of tempting my defiant
    psyche into slumber.  Nor were there any insurmountable walls of
    terror with which to frighten myself into a state of coma.  Rather, I
    was subjected to distant orchestral 'scores' consisting largely of
    single, undulating notes occasionally interrupted by sparse attempts
    at cabaret numbers.  Never mind that the more traditional songs to be
    found throughout the album all boasted the same tempo, Moya's raspy
    Jonathan Donahue-cum-Kim Gordon vocals, and lyrics that sounded as if
    they were borne of some ill-fated collaboration between Rage Against
    the Machine and Tristan Tzara.  One can only stand the refrain, ""The
    bricks start to fall/ Like so many teeth,"" so many times before it
    begins to lose its poetic pretense.</p><p>
    
    It's to Moya's credit that <em>L'eclat du Ciel Était Insoutenable</em>
    is consistent in its cinematic creepiness despite its overbearing
    length.  Songs such as ""Lime Kiln"" break from the record's formulaic
    instrumentation by incorporating such exotic sounds as a theremin (a
    hallmark of any campy 50s sci-fi/nuclear fallout melodrama) succeed
    in offering a unique take on Hrsta's post-apocalyptic lyrical
    obsessions.  But, in maintaining the ethereal and haunting mood of
    the record, Moya often falls back on the same aural tricks, the most
    notable being the liberally administered reverb which coats the
    entire damn album, drowning out whatever subtle intricacies were to
    be found in the songwriting.</p><p>
    
    With my insomnia all but vanished I have more time to deal with my newly
    established disillusionment.  As added insurance, I cut Hopie loose
    and have returned to legally sponsored medical aid (all the while
    praying that my insolence won't be rewarded with a painfully
    unnecessary prostate exam).  Though still a very disappointing
    release, I've come to think of Hrsta as an anomaly: Moya exercising
    his ability as a songwriter while hamfistedly tending to his
    established 'sound.'  Though I'd never refer to any aspect of Moya's
    music as 'irreverent,' the man has never taken himself less seriously
    then he does here.</p></div>"|3944.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3944-leclat-du-ciel-etait-insoutenable/|5.9|Kevin Adickes

    something I'll call the Sideman Bar Mitzvah: a secondary player in a
    once-popular band that goes on to success with his own project (after
    death, or breakup, or incarceration) which stops the initial cash cow
    from lactating.  The SBM happens occurs about as often as a triple play--
    for every Wilco and New Order, there's like 98 Scottie Pippen bands
    like Preston School of Industry or The Kelley Deal 6000.  Yeah, my
    profession is largely to blame for this phenomenon, as we're always
    ready to pounce on an artist's former affiliations.  But a lot of the
    time, these bands' records are Exhibit A as to just why Mr. or Ms.
    Sideperson wasn't the go-to guy/gal back in the good old days.</p><p>
    
    Hey, what a coincidence!  Here we have Enon, the band of
    guitarist/vocalist/keyboardist John Schmersal, former second banana
    in a little outfit called Brainiac.  If you consult your handy
    portable hipster encyclopedia, you'll find Brainiac alongside Joy
    Division and the Minutemen under the heading of 'taken too soon'--
    groups whose career trajectories were cut abruptly short by that
    sickle-wielding bastard Death.  When Timmy Taylor became an automobile
    accident casualty statistic (flying is safer, kids!), Brainiac, sadly,
    flatlined along with him, inspiring years of reverent webboard
    discussion over what might have been.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the cultish buzz around Brainiac's short career has
    also virtually ensured that any future Schmersal project would have
    to operate under the long shadow of his old Dayton purple-hair
    spaz-synth-rock days.  With preconceptions placing him far behind the
    starting line, it would take a pretty good album to force us writers
    to delete our pre-Enon Schmersal biographies and stop using lame
    'rising like a phoenix from the ashes of Brainiac' intros.  Luckily,
    <em>High Society</em> is just such an album, perhaps more varied and
    consistent than anything the defunct Daytonites ever released.</p><p>
    
    Of course, I'm not going to swear off references to the B-word yet,
    in part because Enon still sound a hell of a lot like Schmersal's
    previous employer.  Given that Schmersal's epileptic seizure guitar
    work was such a huge part of Brainiac's herky-jerky sound, this is no
    big surprise, but Enon's also borrowed a great deal of Taylor's vocal
    tics and mini-Moog diddles on their work to date.  <em>Believo!</em>
    took this to an almost uncomfortably eerie level, with Schmersal
    appropriating all of Taylor's cast of vocal characters-- castrati
    jazz singer, seductive cyborg-Jagger, Prozac-industrial screamer--
    for his own performances.  Mired in the same gloom-and-doom electronics
    of Brainiac's later work and sorely lacking Taylor's considerable
    charisma, <em>Believo!</em> only took off when Schmersal tapped into
    his own literal and figurative voice on ""Conjugate the Verbs"" and
    ""For the Sum of It.""</p><p>
<em>High Society</em> still has the occasional throwback tune, like the
    manic hip-swing of ""Pleasure and Privilege"" and the ominous march
    against soda pop ""Carbonation,"" but it largely exhibits Schmersal
    taking his first firm steps towards building an independent identity.
    The opening double shot makes this abundantly clear, with the
    hard-rock crunch of ""Old Dominion"" sliding his falsetto into an
    ominous coda and ""Count Sheep"" broadcasting his surprisingly delicate
    croon.  The album represents a musical shift toward electronic-tinged
    rock rather than <em>Believo!</em>'s rock-tinged electronic, but
    Schmersal throws himself with equal aplomb into the loungy strings
    and Pink Floyd sax solo of the title track and the almost-""Jessie's
    Girl"" radio rock of ""Sold!""</p><p>
    
    While Schmersal is coming out like that creepy Levi's bellybutton
    commercial, the real clincher of <em>High Society</em> is Enon's newest
    member, Toko Yasuda, formerly one-half of The Lapse.  Providing the
    same knockout injection of S-E-X-X that Taylor lent Brainiac, Yasuda
    is a Barbie girl in a Macintosh world, warning her robotic paramour
    on ""Disposable Parts"" that she'll ""throw you away when the flavor
    goes out.""  Contracting out microphone duties allows Schmersal more
    time to rock the vintage keys on ""Shoulder"" and ""In This City,""
    creating prime cuts of what the latest memos have told me I should
    label 'electroclash.'</p><p>
    
    If all the genre-name bocce ball leads you to believe that <em>High
    Society</em> has got more personalities than Sybil, you'd be right.
    But the entire affair is kept cohesive by (cheesy as it sounds) a
    rather upbeat mood-- a dance record for the hooded sweatshirt crowd.
    It's the kind of meet-you-halfway hipster party record the
    Dismemberment Plan has decided they don't want to make anymore.
    Rather than lamenting what could've been with Brainiac, <em>High
    Society</em> says it's time to throw out that memorial black armband
    and Timmy Taylor R.I.P. commemorative plate, 'cause maybe they were
    just the warmup act for Enon all along.</p></div>"|2815.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2815-high-society/|8.8|Rob Mitchum

    ambient post-rock. Guitars, vintage keyboards, ghostly voices
    and the occasional cello are all found on <em>Felt Cover</em>, but not
    all at once.  This album is not minimal in the traditional melodic or
    rhythmic sense of the word; it's that the amount of stuff that
    happens in any one track is kept at a minimum.  This is the kind of
    album where a plucked guitar note is allowed to ring unaccompanied
    until it decays completely, and two chords are more than enough.</p><p>
    
    ""The Light They Intend for You"" is a perfect example of this sonic
    reduction, as two guitar chords, misty wet with rain, are slowly
    plucked as some dialogue (oddly, an excerpt from the Jerry Stahl book
    <em>Permanent Midnight</em>) is whispered beneath the sound.  There are
    a couple chord changes and a bit of organ accent, but that's about it
    for this short piece.  It's more than a little Labradford-esque, but
    at pop-song length, and without the tension that Labradford bring to
    the table. ""Hinged and Still"" has more teeth, as the guitar this time
    duals with a woozy, cascading synthesizer pattern that lends a sense
    of uncertainty.</p><p>
    
    Charles Atlas stake out jazzier territory with ""Valdiviam"" where
    trumpet, brushed drums and a Fender Rhodes give the feel of an
    impressionistic early-70s Chick Corea piece, while the scraping,
    discordant guitar and unsettling drones of ""Minor White"" flirt with
    ugliness.  ""Five Teeth and Crawling"" makes nice with a noirish sweep
    of strings that seems to fall behind the slowly strummed bass and
    guitar chords, the perfect soundtrack to a silent student film shot
    on an empty beach.</p><p>
    
    A few tracks sound decent enough but lack musical substance. ""Que
    Biblia"" is a barely-there piece for solo electric piano that, while
    pretty, seems more like a throwaway film cue than an actual
    composition.  But the damning problem with <em>Felt Cover</em> is not
    that any one track is particularly terrible, it's that the record as
    whole just seems, well, bland.  Even after a half-dozen listens, I
    can't play a single track back in my head once the record is over.
    The best ambient music leaves some kind of aural after-image,
    flickering bits of texture and mood. <em>Felt Cover</em>, while not at
    all offensive, simply vanishes.</p></div>"|1405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1405-felt-cover/|6.4|Mark Richard-San

    writing on the document is in brown, inked calligraphy and the
    bottom right-hand corner bears a drawn approximation of a wax
    royal seal.  The script, though error-free, shows manifest signs
    of instability (herky-jerky loops on descenders, unnaturally exact
    straight lines on ascenders, for example).  Before even reading the
    words on the parchment, it was difficult not to hypothesize that
    whoever wrote this document is a borderline sociopath.  Once you've
    read the words, which appear to mimic a proclamation, it's clear
    that the writer has an unchecked (and unmedicated) Napoleon complex.</p><p>
    
    Here follows the text of the parchment. Make of it what you will:</p><p>
    
    [Beginning of document]</p><p>
    
    Whereas Pullman is a supergroup contisting of Bundy K. Brown (of
    Tortoise, Directions in Music, and Loftus) , Curtis Harvey (of Rex
    and Lotfus), Chris Brokaw (of Come and The New Year) Doug McCombs (of
    Tortoise, Brokeback, and Eleventh Day Dream), and Tim Barnes (of
    Silver Jews);</p><p>
    
    Whereas <em>Viewfinder</em> is Pullman's second album and follows on
    from <em>Turnstyles and Junkpiles</em>, released in 1998;</p><p>
    
    Whereas <em>Viewfinder</em> represents Pullman's attempt to demonstrate
    their plugged-in approximations of the acoustic folky blues of John
    Fahey, Richard Thompson, and Leo Kottke;</p><p>
    
    Whereas Pullman has added percussion and tweaked <em>Viewfinder</em>'s
    tracks in an editing studio;</p><p>
    
    Whereas Pullman have mislaid the conviviality and ensemble joy of
    <em>Turnstyles and Junkpiles</em>;</p><p>
    
    Whereas <em>Viewfinder</em> sounds like individuals playing for
    themselves rather than for the enjoyment of the band and for their
    audience;</p><p>
    
    Whereas <em>Viewfinder</em> contains no heart-breaking gorgeousness
    such as ""Gravenhurst"" from <em>Turnstyles and Junkpiles</em>;</p><p>
    
    Whereas <em>Viewfinder</em>'s tracks would be best heard as
    instrumental segues between features on NPR's <em>Morning
    Edition</em>;</p><p>
    
    I, the Infallible Sovereign of the serene sovereignty of Pitchforkia,
    hereby pronounce <em>Viewfinder</em> profoundly dull, and unworthy to
    be admitted into the presence of any the subjects of Pitchforkia nor
    into the territory of this fair domain.  As I have spoken, so it
    shall be!</p><p>

The floor of my
    apartment is wood-finished and extremely warped, so there are all
    kinds of little bumps and valleys to roll over.  Combine that with
    the fact that all the ball bearings and wheels are brand new and
    heavily viscous and I could amuse myself doing this for quite a
    while.  I guess it's the simple things that give you pleasure after a
    long day at work, juggling projects and trying to get out of there at
    five.  My job is pretty hectic and I usually come home all wound up,
    so it's good to have these little diversions to help myself.  Tonight
    the stress has me feeling particularly goofy.</p><p>
    
    Normally I wouldn't think of Manchester's Doves as an appropriate
    soundtrack for this kind of mood, but that's largely because until
    very recently I was only familiar with their first album, 2000's
    dark, murky <em>Lost Souls</em>.  On that record, the band showed
    their facility with dark, claustrophobic textures and muted melodic
    statements, only occasionally indulging their impressive pop sense.
    And while their latest offering, <em>The Last Broadcast</em>, could
    hardly be called a wholesale revamping of their sound, it concentrates
    mostly on elements that the trio kept very subdued on their debut.</p><p>
    
    For one thing, while <em>Lost Souls</em> was certainly nothing to sniff
    at, the band sounds infinitely more comfortable and confident here,
    placing more faith in their writing and relying less on production to
    put forth their ideas.  The record still abounds with thoughtful
    audio details, mind you-- but here they're almost always employed in
    the service of melody.  Even the exceptions to that rule-- the short
    instrumental tracks like ""Intro"" and ""Where We're Calling From""--
    build tension while moving toward the catharsis of the next
    fully-fleshed song.</p><p>
    
    ""Where We're Calling From"" is a dense wall of swirling guitars and
    keyboards, growing ever thicker until finally evaporating, leaving
    the initial strums of ""N.Y."" in its place.  ""N.Y."" is exultant in
    its first verse, all crashing guitars and soaring vocals. The
    instrumental midsection is one the band's finest moments, cut
    through with an unobtrusive string section and some surprisingly
    dynamic interplay.  ""Let's go while we can/ Put your finger on the
    map/ Who cares where it lands,"" sings Jez Williams as the song gathers
    steam behind him.  It's one of several tracks that makes <em>The Last
    Broadcast</em> a brighter, and in some ways more accessible, album
    than its predecessor.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, the band lay down a ream of excellent songs beginning
    with ""Words,"" a steadily chugging confection of astral guitar, vocal
    harmonies and glockenspiel that does a remarkable job of boring a
    limited melody straight into your memory.  It's followed by the
    loping, seven-minute ""There Goes the Fear,"" which is a strong candidate
    for one of the band's best songs yet, its bounce befitting the subdued
    melody and diving, almost country-ish slide guitar that swoops in the
    background.  Doves have always been a band who could come out swinging
    with a powerful pop song when they wanted to, and this just proves that
    they should do it more often.</p><p>
    
    A few songs naturally point back to the band's original direction,
    such as the haunting, noir ""Friday's Dust,"" with its crystalline
    strings (arranged by Sean O'Hagan and Marcus Holdaway) and strange
    production.  Devoid of percussion, the song floats along almost like
    something Talk Talk might have produced in their later years, replete
    with ghostly clarinets and odd smatterings of brass.  Of course,
    ""Pounding"" bounces right back with a... well, pounding rhythm and a
    sterling melody, as well as some spirited rhythm guitar.</p><p>
    
    The boys get downright proggy on the intro to ""The Sulphur Man,"" with
    sweeping strings deceptively setting the stage for what turns out to
    be a relatively modest song, albeit one cut through with all sorts of
    inventive little flourishes, like the strings that rise in the
    verses, threatening to overtake the vocals before abruptly backing
    down and retreating to the background, only to attempt another coup
    a few seconds later.  It's those details that make a good song great,
    and that's what makes <em>The Last Broadcast</em> an easy record to
    come back to-- chances are you missed an awful lot the first few
    times you listened.</p><p>
    
    ""Caught by the River"" closes things on a high note, riding out on a
    sturdy acoustic guitar frame adorned by the band's usual sonic
    fireworks and pushed forward by some very economical drumming.
    To the listener's benefit, the electric guitar parts aren't so
    economical, and the band masterfully layers soaring leads, ultimately
    ending on a glowing bed of reverb and clean guitar.  It's a fittingly
    dramatic end to an album that's full of drama, without the tiresome
    excess-- a healthy balance if you ask me.  Watch your toes while I
    chair-speed back to the stereo to give it another spin.</p></div>"|2430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2430-the-last-broadcast/|8.0|Joe Tangari

Unlike your Tortoises
    and your Uis and your Mice Parades, the word 'smooth' could never be
    used to describe what Fly Pan Am does.  Their music is loud, messy
    and chaotic, and they come a lot closer to 80s no-wave than they do
    to jazz fusion.  The musicians may or may not be improvising, but if
    they are, it's not out of any respect for a tradition; it's because
    the songs sound a little crazier and more fucked up that way.</p><p>
<em>Ceux Qui Inventent N'ont Jamais Vecu (?)</em> (loosely translated:
    ""those who invent have never lived"") finds the band turning up the
    funk and tuning in to the cosmic vibration of Can's <em>Tago Mago</em>.
    There's no doubt about it, bassist Jean-Sébastian Truchy worships at
    the alter of Holger Czukay, and almost every track here is anchored
    by a percussive bassline that hits like a leather boot to the solar
    plexus.  Moving through and around the groove is a whole mess of
    shaggy, atonal guitar that could come from a U.S. Maple record, all
    of it stitched together with Fly Pan Am's ever-present tape splicing.
    At a few points on the record, the track cuts off completely, only to
    emerge a split-second later a few beats off.  Smooth, this ain't.</p><p>
    
    The rhythmic punch is something to behold throughout the album, but
    once you get used to that, things get a bit iffy.  Too many tracks
    seem like little more than an excuse for the bassist and drummer to
    lock into a love embrace, with no accompanying thematic or melodic
    development.  It would be nice to see more tracks like
    ""Univoque/Equiovoque,"" which has a customarily funky beat but adds ar
    interesting music-box instrumental contrast and ringing guitars that
    border on the beautiful.  By contrast,  cuts like the slapbass workout
    ""Rompre L'Indifference de L'Inexitable Avant Que L'on vienne Rompre
    Le Sommeil de 'Inanimie'"" just kind of hang there. In between these
    poles are ""Sound Support Surface Noises Reaching Out to You,"" which
    combines nervous, jittery funk with Oval-style digital post-production,
    and ""Erreur; Errance; Interdits de Par Leurs Novelles Possibilites,""
    a richly textured sound collage with an assortment of odd organic noises.</p><p>
<em>Ceux Qui Inventent N'ont Jamais Vecu (?)</em> has an attractive air
    of unpredictability: it seems as though each track could go just about
    anywhere at any given moment.  A track called ""Partially Sabotaged
    Distraction"" consistently crashes my computer whenever it comes on,
    and I can't help but wonder if the effect is intentional.  But for
    all the loose experimentation afoot, this is an easy album to ignore.
    Fly Pan Am are not your average post-rock band, but they're not a
    particularly great one, either.</p></div>"|3120.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3120-ceux-qui-inventent-nont-jamais-vecu/|6.0|Mark Richard-San

There's also
    something to be said about jackhammer migraines.  With Ruins, one
    is the cause and the other a potential effect for many listeners.
    Pitchfork has featured a couple of other Ruins CDs by this point, so
    I probably don't need to tell you much about their sound.  What I
    will say is that, since their inception in 1985, they've set industry
    standards for integrity of vision, and a lot of the credit can be
    given to drummer/leader Tatsuya Yoshida's decision to create a new
    band for every new idea or variation he has.  Ruins was his proggy
    noisecore project, and though detractors may argue that so are the
    rest of his bands (including Koenji-Hyakkei and Akaten), it is the
    most purely so.</p><p>
    
    Because of this, anyone who isn't totally down with the original
    concept is in for rough times with Ruins' discography.  Aside from
    the one-off <em>Symphonica</em>, all Ruins records are bass-and-drums
    affairs, with manic yodel-screeching for vocals and the kind of
    needle-in-the-red instrumental acrobatics that give a shitload of
    indie cred to prog, while at the same time turning off most actual
    prog old-schoolers.  I can't begin to imagine what sort of torture it
    would be to sit through something like <em>Stonehenge</em> if I wasn't
    completely on board with this band.  That's where the jackhammer
    migraines come in, because if smooth sailing is your thing, steer
    clear.</p><p>
    
    For fans, a release like <em>1986-1992</em> is fine indeed.  Skin
    Graft's compilation packages ridiculously rare early stuff like the
    original 1986 seven-inch of the band's first four-track recordings,
    their 1987 twelve-inch album, and selected tracks from their third
    record.  Incidentally, all of these releases were simply entitled
    Ruins, so thank Skin Graft for clearing up a potential Google mess.
    Also included are tracks from two easier to find LP's, 1990's
    <em>Stonehenge</em> and 1992's <em>Burning Stone</em>.  Yoshida remixed
    all the tracks last year, and I can tell you that, being familiar
    with the original albums, I was pretty shocked by the remixes.  Very
    noisy!  Mark Richard-San remarked in his review of <em>Burning
    Stone</em> that it was the 'slick' Ruins album.  Not here, as its
    tracks seem to have been given that extra ear-bleeding treatment.
    Give Yoshida credit for creating the impression that all of this
    stuff was recorded at the same time in the same studio, with the same
    production.</p><p>
    
    The opener wastes no time in burning down all bridges to sanity:
    ""Outburn"" is at once the greatest-ever hardcore punk song not to
    protest anything or even feature real words in the lyrics, and a
    public service announcement for ADD awareness.  The main riff is as
    stubbornly assured as anything Bad Brains put to wax, and the lest
    you get bored during its eight seconds, another wild-ass riff is
    there to take its place, and again and again.  It seems like this
    kind of thing should have made the whole math-rock thing obsolete
    before it ever happened, but whatever.  ""Epigonen"" is slower, but
    just as pummeling.  The riffs don't fly by this time, and the
    mid-section is almost like a stoned mosh.  Ruins first bassist
    Kawamoto Hideki even takes the distortion off for a few seconds, only
    to nail it back to your forehead again at the end of the tune.  ""Body
    &amp; Soul"" is still more slow-death, featuring a recognizably metallic
    head, like something you'd hear from a particularly badly recorded
    Sabbath boot.  Perhaps the most interesting track for diehard fans
    will be ""Cambodia,"" previously only available on a compilation called
    <em>NG II.</em>  If not for all the distortion, this could pass for
    straight-ahead King Crimson-esque prog (especially the anthemic
    B-section), and the opening riff is pure cock-rock edge.</p><p>
    
    ""Hallelujah,"" from Ruins' 1988 LP, is also quite proggy compared to
    the rest of this stuff, especially as Yoshida makes the extra effort
    to sing in recognizable tones, and with recognizable harmonies.  They
    turned the distortion off, and there's even a violin in there.
    Whoa... Kansas?  Not quite.  Tunes like ""Infect"" (possibly the most
    menacing thing they ever recorded) and ""B.U.G."" reinforce the notion
    that sheer force and oppressive repetition can do considerable
    damage.  Quaint old bands like Magma used to work in similar realms,
    but Ruins just pounce all over any legacy those bands might have had.
    They're just that devastating.  The <em>Burning Stone</em> tracks are
    more complex, as Ruins has seemingly gotten further and further away
    from tried-and-true musical vices like simple jackhammer migraine
    riffs, but the tunes don't fail to lurch and destroy.  ""Zasca Coska,""
    filled with echo vocals and riffs so unplayable that it just isn't
    that funny, even manages to fill a few life-sucking minutes of the
    song with free improv.  I think I need to turn this down for
    second.</p><p>
    
    Despite the ear-abuse, my only real caveat with the album is that
    fans will probably already own about half of it.  Of course, the
    really early material makes it worthwhile for people like me.  For
    newcomers, I'd suggest hunting down <em>Burning Stone</em> or
    <em>Stonehenge</em> for early Ruins, and work from there.  Yoshida
    doesn't look like he's ever going to stop, so you have plenty of time
    to work your way through to this comp.</p></div>"|6871.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6871-1986-1992/|7.3|Dominique Leone

    it sounded damned unique.  No, the fat beats and the goofy samples
    and the wickedy-wicky weren't anything new, even back in those halcyon
    days of '96, but the idea of fat beats and goofy samples and
    wickedy-wicky on an album bereft of some sucka MC's verbal gymnastics--
    that, friends, was gold.  Instrumental hip-hop, of course, was no more
    radical an idea back then than it is now; but for many of us young
    wannabes and poseurs, <em>Endtroducing</em> was the first time we'd ever
    heard anything quite like it.</p><p>
    
    And even if the concept wasn't just out of the box, the freaky melange
    of John Carpenter soundtracks and visceral, pounding punk beats in a
    hip-hop environment most certainly was.  So, DJ Shadow may not have
    invented instrumental hip-hop, but he did sound a revolution with it.
    And now, six years, two mix records with Cut Chemist and a handful of
    UNKLE remixes later, here we all sit at our little terminals wondering
    if Mr. Josh Davis is capable of doing it all over again.</p><p>
    
    But <em>The Private Press</em> is being dropped into a market vastly
    different than the one that gave birth to its predecessor.  Ninja Tune,
    Mo'Wax and other like-minded labels have spent the last half-decade
    slowly and laboriously digging a grave in which to bury the
    beats-and-samples formula.  Which might explain why-- despite its
    fair share of fat beats, goofy samples and wickedy-wicky-- <em>The
    Private Press</em> will not go down in history as the record that
    brought electronic music out of its state of imminent peril.</p><p>
    
    After an irritating introductory segment in which some woman who's
    probably dead now recites a written letter to a friend (the record
    is littered with these skit-like clips, and though some are mildly
    entertaining, they tend to detract from the real deal), the album
    opens up for real with ""Fixed Income,"" a fine-enough instrumental
    hip-hop retread that leaves little impression after it's clicked
    over to ""Walkie Talkie,"" where things lighten up a bit. Built from
    a harsh drumbeat and a few alternating samples-- a man bellowing
    ""I'm a bad muthafuckin' DJ,"" a woman proclaiming, ""This is why I
    walk and talk this way,"" and the now-ubiquitous cry of ""SUCKA!""--
    the groove on ""Walkie Talkie"" is seriously tight (even 'dope,' if
    you so dare), despite its too-quirky, scratched-upon boasting.</p><p>
    
    Up until now, <em>The Private Press</em> has resided in the comfortable
    niche chiseled out by <i>Endtroducing</i>, albeit with a less darkly
    atmospheric bent.  But the record's also got its fair share of tracks
    that sound nothing like Shadow's previous endeavors; alongside the
    familiar sounding cuts, new directions abound: on ""Six Days,"" a soulful
    R&amp;B; crooner tears off close to a week's worth of page-a-days, lamenting
    with each that, ""Tommorow never comes until it's too late.""  This
    007-esque sentiment is set to hand drums and organ washes that wouldn't
    sound out of place on a pitched-down Can record.  ""Right Thing/GDMFSOB""
    infuses the standard Shadow routine with a hint of electro, replacing
    some of the trademark live-sounding drumming with cheesy machines, and
    looping a nicely staggered vocal to fit the beat.</p><p>
    
    ""Monosylabik"" heads a bit further down this path, matching a vocal
    sample and drenched-in-delay drums with buzzing synths and bumping
    bass. ""Mashin' on the Motorway"" is a short but sweet tip of the hat to
    road rage, ""Grand Theft Auto III,"" and those reckless driving songs
    rebelliously churned out in the 1950s.  Angry drivers serenade Lateef
    the Truth Speaker (of the Quannum Projects duo Latyrx) with horn honks
    and swears as he ponders the slow-moving fiends surrounding him
    (""I tell 'em move over/ This road ain't big enough for ya/ I'm flying
    like Knight Rider/ They tryin' to keep up with they Grandma beside em'/
    'Sides, maybe his steel-belted radials are expired/ Maybe they tired/
    Maybe their odometer needs to be rewired""), the whole thing escalating
    until it crashes and detonates like a hundred-car pile-up.</p><p>
    
    Next up is ""Blood on the Motorway,"" a comparatively slow, meditative
    reaction.  Spoken word ruminations about death fall over simple piano
    chords, chimes and bad 80s synths, the relative corniness of which
    I could tolerate were it not for the hair-metal balladeering that
    comes with it.  At one point, the vocalist repeats the phrase ""let
    the laughter..."" three times before he manages to get to what he
    wants us to allow the laughter to do.  Personally, the melodramatic
    delivery of such underwhelming lines as, ""Your eyes will not close/
    Your tongue barely speaks/ But I can still feel you,"" over an
    electro-synth arpeggio isn't exactly my cup of tea.  Still, I
    appreciate Shadow's attempt to take a different approach, even if
    I don't care for the execution.  Besides, the song does eventually
    resolve itself with a hot instrumental charge headed by a
    tight-as-can-be breakbeat, so I suppose nothing's lost... er, except
    any unhealthily harbored expectations of perfection.</p><p>
    
    Shadow closes the album with a song called ""You Can't Go Home Again.""
    The title fits: though he makes a point of referencing styles and
    techniques from his breakthrough debut, he's clearly most interested
    in forward-thinking sounds.  Like watching live improvisation, the
    results aren't always perfect, but you feel part of the process; the
    relative success of the whole takes a back seat to the art of trying.</p><p>
    
    It's better this way, anyhow.  It would, after all, be a sad thing if
    Shadow took a sad shot at Xeroxing his debut.  But what would be sadder
    is if people dismissed this album just because it doesn't live up to the
    strength of its groundshattering predecessor. <em>The Private Press</em>
    is more solid an album than anyone dared expect from an older, wiser
    DJ Shadow, and though it won't be televising another revolution, I'd

    they were sucking the band off), Incubus were notable if only because
    they'd managed to make the turntables just another bland member
    amongst the traditional rock-and-roll trio of bass, guitar and drums.
    Deracinated, the needle became simply a tool for decoration.
    Considering the title of the first track, ""Roll the Dice Man, Baby
    Needs a New Ellipsis,"" I was a little wary of the dull scratching
    that begins the new album from The Roots of Orchis.  Thankfully, the
    piece develops into a smooth post-rocking instrumental with a dusty
    groove that never imagines itself any more pimped out than it is.
    Other instruments humbly rise: a supple bassline to add some swing,
    synthesizers to make it all swirl, and the scratching's never too
    pervasive.</p><p>
    
    Of course, they could have called themselves The Roots of Tortoise.
    Not to overuse the Chicago scenesters as post-rock's only
    touch-point, but <em>Some Things Plural</em> specifically brings to
    mind Tortoise's self-titled debut on Thrill Jockey.  By contrast,
    this is the Roots' third album, and they've updated their organic,
    jazzy-soft sound with a lot of feedback drones, layered keyboards,
    and other electronic processing.  The aforementioned song actually
    reminds me more of the swerving rhythms on Scott Herren's Savath +
    Savalas project.  But the way that the bass guitar always prods
    insistently forward (yet remains the backbone of these forty-five
    minutes) recalls Dave Pajo's short time with the Tortoiseheads.</p><p>
    
    The Roots of Orchis have grown to the point where they're very
    careful about songwriting.  There are few central melodies per se--
    more a selection of motifs that they create through changes in
    rhythm.  Each song clearly began as a jam, but the final versions are
    all trimmed for eloquence: no filler.  A subtle whiff of cymbals and
    synth begins ""39 Years, 4 Months Ago Today,"" and the guitar emits a
    barely-audible scrim of sound in the background, like a hi-fi version
    of Cul de Sac's noodling.  The Roots play with much more restraint
    than those post-surfers, though: soon the elements lock together and
    the pace steadily increases then calms down again, where other
    literalists would have launched the expected rawk-out.</p><p>
    
    Most of the time the emphasis is on chilldom, as with ""Halfway to a
    Handshake,"" which could serve as the soundtrack to any number of
    dingy lounge nights.  There's really not much to distinguish these
    guys from their brethren, though.  By the time ""Log Jammin"" rolls by,
    you're waiting for a bit more than rapid-fire hi-hats from a drum
    machine to stir the mix.  The later tracks all start to sound the
    same.  If the band really wants to stand out, they need to write more
    songs like ""The Calm Within the Storm,"" where the gentle ring of a
    xylophone belies the tension whipped up later by guest Josh Quan's
    bass clarinet.  Yet even this track barely reaches a roil.  Still,
    The Roots of Orchis have been getting a good amount of airtime on
    college radio, and there's no doubt <em>Some Things Plural</em> would
    be great accompaniment for a late-night session around the bong.</p></div>"|6836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6836-some-things-plural/|7.0|Christopher Dare

    fact, a remix album.  Honestly, does anyone really look forward to
    these things?  Ten bucks to hear some of Band X's hit singles given a
    rhythm transfusion and made twice as long?  Sign me up!  For years,
    the phrase 'remix album' has been only slightly less off-putting than
    'tribute album,' though at least there are people like Herbert (not
    Paula Abdul) who occasionally nail the concept of a remix well enough
    to obscure its fundamental pointlessness.  Of course, for every one
    person like Matt Herbert, there are a dozen others whose wanky retreads
    do nothing more than inflict economic damage on unwitting consumers.</p><p>
    
    What's that, Mr. Lady?  Le Tigre's <em>Remix</em> isn't designed to
    simply steal money from all of their loyal fans, but rather as a
    ""vision for a hardcore dance genre infused with radical politics""?
    I beg to differ!  Come on, <em>Remix</em> is just about as standard
    as remix albums can get-- four songs from <em>Feminist Sweepstakes</em>,
    one off the <em>From the Desk of Mr. Lady</em> EP, one from the
    self-titled debut, and all (with one exception) are clearly <i>worse</i>
    than the originals.  That's not too surprising, see, but unlike most
    bands to fall prey to the remix syndrome, Le Tigre has a lot more to
    lose-- namely, the message.</p><p>
    
    Anyone with even a passing familiarity with Le Tigre, Bikini Kill, or
    her solo outing as Julie Ruin can't miss the fact that Kathleen Hanna
    has always used her music as medium to broadcast her and her bandmates'
    neo-feminist viewpoints.  Sure, she's traded the aggressive,
    slash-and-burn mentality of Bikini Kill for the fuzzy drones and
    lounge-y beats of The Tiger, but her message has always come through
    loud and clear.  The aim of Le Tigre is not to get people dancing to
    the soothing tones of feminist rhetoric, it's to intellectually
    challenge people while they're busy getting their groove on.  So, if
    anything, the biggest failure of this record is that, for the most
    part, it puts the disco before the discussion.</p><p>
    
    Of course, being a remix record and all, that seems to be the aim
    here-- even though the original songs are some of the most direct
    tunes in Le Tigre's catalog.  Across the board, the mixes manage to
    obfuscate the content by either sampling to the point of irrelevance,
    cutting lyrics, or just submerging them deep within the mix.  It's
    rare for a band to be able to tackle such a wide array of issues with
    intellect as well as a smirking sense of humor, but the DJs at work
    here ditch all that.  This can potentially be overlooked (especially
    if the mixes work), but with three wimmin as overtly political as
    Hanna, Johanna Fateman, and JD Samson, it doesn't seem fair to evaluate
    the music separately from the politics.</p><p>
    
    Maybe that what's you're looking for, though.  Maybe you want some of
    that patented, infectious Le Tigre dancecore without all the messy
    talk about issues.  Well, don't hold your breath, because this thing
    isn't winning any awards on that front, either.  Most of the cuts
    follow the standard remix procedure of just messing with the rhythm
    track and sampling the original without too much thought to the final
    product. ""Tres Bien (The Nouveau Disco Mix)"" from Analog Tara gives
    its source a decent trance-inspired makeover; Reid Speed's ""Aphro-Dykey
    Mix"" of ""Dyke March 2001"" doesn't change much more than the name of the
    track.  And it actually hurts me on a personal level to think about the
    DFA's remix of ""Deceptacon,"" which sucks out all of the original's Joy
    Division-ish bassy goodness in favor of a simplistic funk pattern looped
    ad nauseam.</p><p>
    
    The saving grace of this album is Lauren Flax's Flaxdatass mix of
    ""Much Finer""-- it's the only cut that somehow manages to walk the
    fine line between preserving the feel of the original, and genuinely
    adding something worthwhile to it.  The track is subtly restructured
    with a more complex underlying rhythm and a keyboard riff that sounds
    vaguely lifted from ""Blue Moon,"" and frankly, it sounds fantastic.  If
    there were a couple more like this one, Le Tigre's <em>Remix</em> might
    be rubbing elbows with those few other elite remixes that don't suck.
    As it stands, its membership card to that club got lost in the mail,
    along with any point to most of the mixes, and a good reason for even
    releasing this record.  Hopefully the DJs will be able to make more use
    of it than the average listener.</p></div>"|4702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4702-remix/|4.3|Eric Carr

    activate your patchouli filters, and then answer me this: why does
    Vic Chesnutt (who is so irrevocably cool) make records with
    Widespread Panic (who are so irrevocably not)?  I don't mean to
    over-refer to the car accident that handicapped Chesnutt, but he
    is a jalopist: his music peaks when it's wreckage-esque, arranged
    in a dangerous and fragile fashion that fits the stark goulash of
    his boondoggler-philosopher persona.  And here he is in Brute with
    the airtight Widespread Panic, who check every valve like purgatorial
    Pep Boys.  I wonder if Birkenstocks outnumber Campers at their live
    shows.</p><p>
    
    For chrissakes, Vic Chesnutt was in <em>Sling Blade</em>!  Remember
    when drizznunk, moodswinging Dwight Yoakam slams Chesnutt's wheelchair
    into the door, almost capsizing him?  <em>Sling Blade</em> told it like
    it is-- showcasing power lines and potholes and crutches and fast food
    and armpit moisture, not Jennifer Love Hewitt in spaghetti straps bending
    over every six minutes.  Like <em>Fargo</em> or <em>Lone Star</em>, it
    presented a region as its frumpy self, and dadgummit, that's how I
    like my alt-country/avant-roots/No Depression/cowpunk/ya'llternative/thunderplink/asscord/shitporch.</p><p>
    
    But on <em>Cobalt</em>, Panic fails to meet Chesnutt's dark vision
    even halfway. When the first song kicks in, you'll think you
    accidentally switched on an adult-contemporary station broadcasting
    a John Hiatt/Bonnie Raitt duet. The band's playing is clean, but
    straight-up soulless. What is it that their fans can't get enough of?
    ""Man, bro, hey, bro, shazam, these jokers are <i>technically
    proficient!</i>""  The showtune plod of  ""You're With Me Now"" would
    bring the house down at your older stepbrother's sparsely attended
    second wedding, the band keeping it real like the Carnival Cruise
    poolside karaokist.  ""Adirondacks"" starts with some Bob Seger electric
    piano before busting into a patented Counting Crows midtempo anthem;
    ""Scholarship"" offers guitar tones I haven't heard since Britny Fox
    broke up.  This music is tame, <i>tame</i> Southern Rock, like the
    honeysuckle bloat of late Drivin' n' Cryin'.</p><p>
<em>Cobalt</em> triumphs only on ""Puppy Sleeps,"" a riff-anchored track
    with just enough ingratiating hangnail cracker-funk to transcend the
    Disney-does-Skynryd of its peers.  My molten downstairs neighbor
    knocked on my door, incense wafting from her absorbent pajamas-- I'm
    thinking she'd finally come to borrow a cup of love, but nope: ""What
    the hell are you playing that has that repetitive bassline?""  I
    pretended to be an exchange student house-sitting for someone much
    cooler.</p><p>
    
    Yet, Chesnutt fans might wanna shell out their germy tender for
    <em>Cobalt</em> anyway, because Vic more than holds up his end of the
    bargain.  His befitting themes of figurative paralysis, inertia, and
    atrophy all get thorough re-examinations. The drearier songs offer no
    escape; they're full of armory machinists, carpet plants and flour
    mills, and they recommend bridges from which ""suicide is a cinch.""
    The maudlin harmonica of ""Expiration Day"" is dead-on: Vic namechecks
    W.H. Auden and weird Southern county names, and his plangorous voice
    is as ripe as ever, despite what the twinklestains on Amazon.com say
    in their customer reviews about how the vox ""leave alot to be desired""
    and aren't ""Widespread quality.""</p><p>
    
    Vic loves him some Latinate diction, and he enunciates it so much
    better than the thesaurus-boys in Bad Religion and Lullaby for the
    Working Class, exaggerating the mouthfuls like a phonetic alchemist.
    When he sings ""stupid preoccupations,"" he sings ""a-steyoo-peyid
    eh-paree-awk-cue-payaysheyuns.""  He continues to view the world as
    an equation (a habit he's had since the songs on his 1988 debut
    <em>Little</em>), condemning drug-culture friendships with the line,
    ""All we have in common are psychoactive compounds,"" on ""All Kinds,""
    a classic peep at the problem of evil that harps on kiddie porn and
    ""stale mounds of semen.""  But the overwhelming keeper is his new
    arrangement of old song ""Cutty Sark.""  Panic performs a warm and
    subdued Lambchop impression, and the lyrics are a gold amalgam of
    Chesnutt's tendency to throw images together and see what happens--
    a style that too often results in songscapes rather than songs,
    soundscapes that are often barren despite their crowdedness.</p><p>
    
    If this record had a dozen more like ""Cutty Sark,"" I'd be lobbying
    for a 9+ rating and its subsequent canonization, hippie caravan
    and all.  Hell, you can tell just by the pictures that stubbly,
    pensive Vic is the tormented bomb while Widespread are bootleg, all
    smiling with their flowing manes, ballcaps, and Reeboks.  If you want
    an endearing jalopy, get the Ugly Casanova CD.  If you're a die-hard
    Vic-ophile, get this anyway and make your own faux-folk cover art.
    Otherwise you'll be as embarrassed of Panic's presence as you are of
    that girl you made out with because she looked like Jeff Tweedy.</p></div>"|981.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/981-co-balt/|5.9|William Bowers

    'New York sound' on record would be to do shit like field-record our
    jail cells, scrape chins, and do a lot of screaming.  Amplified
    screaming.  Affected screaming.  And while Pixeltan don't quite go
    that far, they definitely have the screaming part down, and with
    plenty of grunts and moans to boot.  While remaining minimal enough
    to stay cool, Pixeltan manages to ride perverted human drum-machine
    beats just on the edge of exploding.  The crackly, fucked-up guitar
    (it's a synth!  No, wait, it's a bass!) is consistently surprising
    in its range of sounds.</p><p>
    
    This four-song EP clocks in at just under twelve minutes, another nod
    to its style-- as if to say, ""We could hang out here a while longer,
    but this scene is beat,"" or, ""There is most definitely a better place
    to be right now than in this fucking recording studio.""  Several
    aspects of the music itself favor this short length, including the
    inhumane beats pounded out by Hisham (Black Dice's drummer, who has
    since left Pixeltan to do the Black Dice gig full time) and the Yoko
    Ono-on-crack stylings of Mika's vocals.  Really, this EP couldn't go
    on for that much longer without completely detonating, erasing itself,
    and leaving no trace of its origins.</p><p>
    
    All four songs stay enough within the boundaries of dance music: hit
    it and quit it.  Pixeltan definitely hits it, with sneered breathy
    vocals: ""It's gonna get you... It's gonna get you... It's gonna get
    you... It's gonna get you... It's gonna get you... It's gonna get you...
    GONNA GET YOU... GONNA GET YOU... GONNA GET YOU...""  After listening
    to this EP over and over again, real paranoia begins to set in.  This
    is the New York of Now.</p><p>
    
    Comparisons can clearly be drawn to the obvious: Liquid Liquid, Public
    Image Ltd., etc.  Troubleman's website says Pixeltan draw from these
    sources, ""but with a harder, more electronic edge.""   I'm not sure if
    that's 100% accurate, but it's pretty damn close.  To me it sounds like
    those bands, but with a more modern feel and an overdriven, erratic,
    second-half-of-""Sister Ray"" vibe: totally sloshed and yelling from the
    back of the bar.</p><p>
    
    What Pixeltan lacks in length, they make up for with actual power and
    movement, which tons of these bullshit New York bands clearly lack.
    What they have in power, they may lack in diversity-- which is a
    difficult thing to judge over the course of twelve minutes, no matter
    how many times you listen to it.  Still, the power level stays at
    ten, and if you crank it and leave it there, the twelve minutes seem
    to last a lot longer.</p></div>"|6312.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6312-pixeltan-ep/|7.7|Michael Bernstein

Somehow, over
    the years, commercial success has eluded you, but critical acclaim certainly
    hasn't-- every publication from <em>Magnet</em> to <em>NME</em> has taken time out
    of their day to tell people you're great at what you do.  After seven fine
    albums with your band American Music Club (and five great solo records), you're
    getting ready to cut your next album.</p><p>
    
    And you record ten songs written by other people.  Why?  Who knows-- maybe you
    just need a break from your own material and your own life for a while.  Or you
    want to pay tribute to some people who inspired you over the years.  Whatever
    the reason, abandoning your main strength when you go in to record is a pretty
    risky proposition.</p><p>
    
    Mark Eitzel is well known for his deeply personal songwriting, and with good
    reason.  He's a master of drawing out his own anguish and suffering and putting
    it in terms you can relate to as a listener, and he's always managed to find the
    right musical backdrop for his confessionals, whether working with American
    Music Club or on his own.  But on this record, you get to hear him tackling
    Culture Club, Curtis Mayfield, Phil Ochs, Bill Withers and others, with varying
    degrees of success.  Is that a smile I see in the photo on the back of the
    booklet?  What's going on here?</p><p>
    
    Well, listening to it, one of the first things that's apparent is
    that Eitzel isn't willing to alter his approach to accommodate his
    subject matter-- whether he's taking on an old John Hartford chestnut
    or a demanding melody like Curtis Mayfield's ""Move on Up,"" he keeps
    things firmly within his range.  Of course, there's a reason Eitzel
    is usually noted for his songwriting and not his singing-- his deep,
    breathy baritone is a limited instrument, but he manages to get a lot
    of mileage out of it, and <em>Music for Courage &amp; Confidence</em> is no
    exception.  The album sees Eitzel backed by a conspicuously high-calibre
    cadre of backing musicians, from Ryan Adams producer Ethan Johns to
    bigshot drummers Joey Waronker and Larry Mullins, though nicely, they
    all manage to stay out of the spotlight, allowing Eitzel to remain the
    center of attention.</p><p>
    
    On Eitzel's last outing, 2001's outstanding <em>The Invisible Man</em>,
    he experimented with more electronic textures and indulged the part
    of him that liked to listen to Kraftwerk when he was younger, in the
    process creating what may be his best solo outing yet.  There are
    hints of that direction on this album as well, as Eitzel and
    producers Brian Paulson and Johan Kugelberg brought in Napoleon Hill
    to craft backgrounds for three tracks here.  The result is an icy
    take on Culture Club's ""Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?"" that reveals
    a dark undercurrent you might have missed in the original, as well as
    interesting versions of the Flamingoes' ""I Only Have Eyes for You,""
    and strangely, Andrea True's 1976 disco smash ""More, More, More.""
    ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" is surprisingly well-served by the wobbly
    soundscape and rough acoustic guitar treatment it's given here.
    ""More, More, More"" chugs and burbles, overflowing with programmed
    hi-hat and sampled guitar noise, cut through with brief, rhythmless
    ambient interjections-- a far cry from the original.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, it sounds like Eitzel and his crew had some genuine fun
    making this record, as evidenced by the amusing, almost Zappa-esque
    monologue he uses to cap off Kris Kristofferson's ""Help Me Make It
    Through the Night.""  Bill Withers' ""Ain't No Sunshine"" seems an
    especially apropos selection for the perennially gloomy Eitzel, and
    he handles it beautifully, making it one of the most faithful covers
    on the album.  Marc Capelle's funky Wurlitzer fills the room with
    smoke while Mullins' tight drumming keeps the tension high during
    the song's quieter moments.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the album's finest track is
    also its most upbeat-- an effervescent, spirited take on John Hartford's
    ""Gentle on My Mind"" (some of you might be familiar with Glen Campbell's
    version).  A Latin feel, oddball keyboards and Justin Meldal-Johnson's
    melodic bass transport you briefly to some quasi-Lynchian lounge.
    Almost as good is the quick-paced and surprisingly faithful version
    of Mayfield's ""Move on Up,"" which finds Eitzel singing parts he never
    seemed capable of before, bringing the whole affair down about two
    octaves.  It's hardly better than the incredible original, but it's
    certainly a worthy tribute if there ever was one.</p><p>
    
    The album closes with a weird, whispery cover of the Fain/Kahal
    classic ""I'll Be Seeing You.""  Eitzel's baritone scrapes at the
    bottom of its range, reduced to an odd whisper as he sings the lines
    ""I'll be seeing you/ In all the old familiar places.""  It's actually
    quite compelling-- kind of like parting with a close friend and just
    hoping you'll see them again soon.  And of course, I do hope to be
    seeing Eitzel again soon, though next time it'd be nice if he'd bring
    some of his own songs to the table.  For now, this covers record is a
    charming enough document that fans will almost certainly find worthwhile.</p></div>"|2702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2702-music-for-courage-confidence/|7.5|Joe Tangari

    of the most inviting piles of it I've ever heard-- a profusion of all
    things twisted, wrecked, corrupt and sour and terrified.  All I want
    to do is dive in and roll around in its richness.  Each track or
    <em>Knife Play</em> is like a rock song captured in a photo negative,
    with all the hidden details brought frighteningly to the fore.  It's
    a debut clearly in the debt of post-punk, one that has cut up and
    contorted itself to fit into the few cracks that albums in the past
    haven't reached.</p><p>
    
    All this may be guessed from the infamous cover sticker, which reads:
    ""When my mom died I listened to Henry Cowell, Joy Division, Detroit
    techno, the Smiths, Takemitsu, Sabbath, Gamelan, 'Black Angels' and
    Cecil Taylor.""  The quote comes from the group's enfant terrible,
    Jamie Stewart, and many who've bought the album for its influences
    aren't prepared for his tantrums.  Though he cools down to a whisper
    later on, the first few songs shift without warning into strained
    cries, yelps and howls.  I'll make my warning very clear: there will
    be hordes of people who will absolutely hate this album.  They'll
    diss it for being too histrionic and pretentious, and maybe they'll
    even be right.</p><p>
    
    Stewart wants to shock you, of course.  His vocals stage guerilla
    skirmishes, cowering back in thickets of sound before pelting out a
    wild yell.  Admittedly, at times he reaches a level of unintentional
    self-parody.  ""Hives Hives"" opens with an awesome squall of feedback,
    but soon the tense, rumbling drum crashes peak with Stewart pining,
    ""A-I-D-S/ H-I-V/ I cannot wait to die, can't you tell, can't you tell,
    can't you tell?""  It's pathetic to the point of banality, the height
    of clichéd angst.  Hope comes only in sonic bombast-- one of the most
    gloriously nihilistic guitar solos I've heard in a while, a solid
    screed of stupid feedback firing measure after measure into nothingness.</p><p>
    
    Stewart is more than just a Reznorian miserabilist, though.  In taking
    Xiu Xiu absolutely literally, people will miss their sense of humor.
    The drum machine on ""I Broke Up (SJ)"" patters manically forward until
    the rhythm splits in a hopeful burst: the keyboards swell like a Peter
    Gabriel ballad, then just as soon wilt and reveal some psychotic twin.
    Then the sudden scream: ""THIS IS THE WORST VACATION EVER-- I'M GOING TO
    CUT OPEN YOUR FOREHEAD WITH A ROOFING SHINGLE!""  ""Anne Dong\xEE"" proceeds
    with more subtlety: solemn, almost religious bells and other clanging
    sounds set the rhythm amid the soft drone of a saxophone.  This long,
    slow dirge is capped off nonchalantly with a deadpan impression of a
    young Jarvis Cocker: ""You're not coming to my birthday.  Ohh, I know.""</p><p>
    
    Despite these moments, <em>Knife Play</em> is deadly serious, an album
    for the mad and the ill, the suicidal and those near death.  As such,
    with Xiu Xiu form fits function-- the songs warp aurally to match the
    anguish in the lyrics, drudge on in approximation of the doldrums, or
    just fizzle out in aborted contempt.  ""Don Diasco"" opens with ar
    ornate gong pattern, signaling the band's classical ambitions.  New
    Order synth-pads thump for a second and then cease, and Stewart's
    passionate breathiness reminds a little of Talk Talk's Mark Hollis.
    The brass figures at the beginning of ""Luber"" seem to have drifted
    away from Björk's ""Aeroplane,"" but then the trumpet bleeds into
    aquatic synthesizers, leaving an aching feeling instead of the
    former's contentment.</p><p>
    
    I'm tempted to favor the strangest turns, as on the Thighpaulsandra-esque
    ""Homonculus,"" where dissonant piano figures are obliterated by crunchy
    bass bombs.  But the piece that seems to resonate with everyone the
    most is ""Suha,"" a relatively straightforward ballad about a mother who
    is going to hang herself; it's stark enough to make you start eyeing
    your own wrists. The band admits that most of their material is directly
    autobiographical, and a dark, voyeuristic pleasure enters play when you
    realize that Stewart's addressing other band members in a few of the
    songs.  That ability to marry oblique sounds and a sense of mystery to
    a sentimental, personal narrative makes these patchwork vignettes
    incredibly affecting, and it's no wonder that the disc scans as a
    bizarre love child of synth-pop, no wave and goth.  So fuck your 'art
    damage' and your 'pathetic self-pity.'  Intensity this overwhelming
    makes you reevaluate your opinion on what emotions music has the
    right to explore.  <em>Knife Play</em> may have its weaknesses, but
    it's oddly cathartic to immerse yourself in, peeling back layer after
    layer.</p></div>"|8821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8821-knife-play/|8.3|Christopher Dare

Four years ago, when you bid us adieu, perhaps
    not too many people noticed or cared-- but those of us who did shook
    our heads and heaved a heavy, regretful sigh.  We knew your time had
    come; it was obvious.  Math-rock was on the inevitable slide,
    especially heavy instrumental math-rock like yours.  Too few ideas,
    too many bands, drawing upon too few sources.  So you got out while
    the getting was good, after releasing just one full-length, a couple
    EPs, and a single.  Brief, direct, lean, to the point-- just like the
    band itself.  A minimal but pummeling drummer and two guitarists.
    Bassist?  Who needs a bassist?  The gypsies had no homes and you had
    no bassist.  It all made sense, and after a tour in support of your
    lone proper album, you called it quits, and that too made sense.</p><p>
    
    But now you're back with a new record, <em>Interiors</em>, but why?  I
    can see how the threads from the earlier stuff flow through onto this
    one, but on the whole this seems like the work of a completely
    different band, and, well, you are largely a completely different
    band, so why not just come out and say so?  It's not like ELO touring
    without Jeff Lynne or anything.  Guitarists Dan Burton and Chris
    Carothers are on board, but gone is drummer Rory Leitch, and while
    replacement Kevin Duneman is adequate, frankly, he lacks the punch and
    quick snap of Leitch, whose drumming went a long way toward creating
    your distinctive sound amidst the faceless hordes of mathy noodlers.
    But on top this personnel shift, the string section from Burton's
    Early Day Miners (the band he formed soon after Ativin disbanded) is
    all over this record.  So, based on the line-up alone, this could
    almost be called a Early Day Miners release.</p><p>
    
    But based on the music, too, <em>Interiors</em> is closer to Early Day
    Miners than your old self. Sure, this album has got those repetitive,
    interlocking guitar patterns we came to love, but they're less
    disorienting now and more atmospheric-- like Early Day Miners.  Hell,
    it's even got vocals on a couple songs-- and bass, and baritone
    guitar, and electronics, and strings, and on and on.  It's like a
    freaking orchestra!  Don't get me wrong, this is a nice little record
    you've made here; it just seems conflicted.  I dunno, I like things
    to make sense, and what made Ativin Ativin, in my mind, was the
    leanness and power.  No offense, but you were like a well-bred horse,
    even when you got a little trippy and sprawling on that last posthumous
    EP of yours-- it was still simple and undeniably listenable.  Now
    you're just all over the place.</p><p>
    
    There are some heavy, ass-kicking segments here, like the tailsection
    of ""End of Tape"" or pretty much the entirety of ""Scissors"" and ""Two
    Knives as Crutches,"" but what to do with the dubbed-out ""When the Sky
    Turns Clear,"" or the going nowhere-ness of ""Underwater,"" or the
    stuttering mumble of ""A Single Crease""?  It would be different if
    these curveballs were aimed at something, but somehow they just seem
    like exercises in recording technique.  I know Burton runs his own
    studio now, but c'mon, there's no reason for about half of these
    songs.  Ativin, you've traded in your economy for the sprawl of Early
    Day Miners, without securing much of their luminous grandeur in the
    bargain. At any rate, welcome back. Here's your lukewarm review.</p></div>"|335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/335-interiors/|6.0|Jason Nickey

    that particular record was perfect, but not this one' yeah well you were busy
    talking about at the motherfucking drive in back then so let me redeem your

    nine dot one up there but i promise you 'the eminem show' is really a ten,
    know that</p><p>
    
    oh my darling eminem! how i love you marshall, spittin shiny massive magnetic

    going to try, you have to hear him spit at it live or on record</p><p>
    
    that said he's playing the same old marshall vs shady real-or-fake game as
    usual (stage-y red curtain album cover referencing 'smarmy' faux-soul
    masterpiece lexicon of love!?!) and its as interesting and complex as it ever

    haha no</p><p>
    
    he's complicated you know</p><p>
    
    eminem i mean</p><p>
    
    but no no no this is more than usual like he pukes up the nastiest song about
    mother mathers ever but loves hailie lots and meanwhile metamorphasizes into a
    grown-ass woman 'on the rag and ovulating' making us listen to queen and
    aerosmith and and AND THEN him and dre have been 'fucking with hats off' all
    along!! (after this ahem revelation dre deadpans 'suck it, marshall')</p><p>
    
    uh</p><p>
    
    in a normal pfork review there would be some more bullshit here all like 'ha
    ha he makes fun of that stupid trl but he's on it!!' or like 'his rapping

    track one</p><p>
    
    white america</p><p>
    
    after a tender orchestral prelude (lexicon of love again) these like big
    silver jets fly overhead and lame linkin park riffs rev up and eminem
    'finally' addresses the race issue telling us a bunch of shit we already knew
    about in his labored 'the way i am' style (with only a marginally better
    chorus than that grr)</p><p>
    
    haha later he gets crunk and actually says 'whodi' on the bounciriffic
    everlast-dreams-about-the-big-tymers 'superman'!! (fake southern accents are
    the new black italiano you know)</p><p>
    
    also on hailies song he sings and its not great but like better than mos def</p><p>
    
    first in a series - people your fake indie ass will mention in a lame rock
    critic attempt to legitimize eminem:  screamin' jay hawkins</p><p>
    
    'business' is cartoon-beat chase scene batman &amp; robin like all the early
    singles but this time he's actually talking about batman and robin!! (a
    running theme of the entire record for some wonderful reason)</p><p>
    
    i adore the plasticky genital mutilation pornography and hilarious cronenberg
    AIDS horrors of 'drips' and anxiously await the obie trice record</p><p>
    
    but more than that i love hailie jade on 'my dad's gone crazy' which is like
    this saccharine-sweetened lemon incest gone faggy (eminem may have finally
    torn down the old gangsta wont-touches of mama and jesus off the wall to beat
    the shit out them both but dude still loves his baby girl!)</p><p>
    
    and the sleazy disco of 'without me'</p><p>
    
    'the press' wet dream like bobby and whitney'!</p><p>
    
    'cleaning out my closet' takes the childhood hell of 'all i've got is you' and
    turns all that emotional vunerability into righteous articulated fury at his
    'goin though public housin systems, victim of munchausens syndrome'(!!) mama.</p><p>
    
    hey</p><p>

There wasn't even an inking
    of a minority report on <em>Low Kick and Hard Bop</em>. All three mutant
    visionaries reported that only Elisabeth Esselink (operational guise:
    Solex) could have created the splendidly chaotic beat-a-rama.  But I
    consulted the Pitchfork precogs only out of curiosity.  From the
    opening moments of the title track through to the closer, ""Look-- No
    Fingerprints!"" I couldn't mistake any of this album for someone
    else's work.</p><p>
    
    The debut Solex album, <em>Solex vs. the Hitmeister</em>, sampled unwanted
    record store vinyl, telling personal tales of ripped stockings and Solex's
    Rolex.  Solex album number two, <em>Pick Up</em>, sampled live performances
    and roughened up the gentler edges of the debut, but retained the minuscule
    vignettes of trivial activity.  ""Oh Blimey"" tells of a woman pulling ""bits
    and bobs"" out of her pocket with all the glee of Björk, but none of the
    pixie princess' staged naiveté.  Despite the commonplaceness of her lyrics,
    Esselink made sure that the musical accompaniment was far harsher thar
    before.  Perhaps someone had offloaded a bunch of soundboard tapes by Minor
    Threat's Dutch equivalents.</p><p>
    
    Though <em>Low Kick and Hard Bop</em> doesn't retreat from <em>Pick Up</em>'s
    abrasiveness, it does draw its samples from a wider array of sources,
    with Esselink making far savvier choices of skitter-funk drum breaks to
    loop.  Thus, <em>Low Kick and Hard Bop</em> takes far fewer listens to
    capture the listener. This third time around has given Esselink the
    opportunity to show off her near-perfect ability to mimic Fall song
    titles. ""Mere Imposters,"" ""Ease Up You Fundamentalists,"" and ""Look--
    No Fingerprints!"" are just three examples of Esselink's appropriatior
    of Mark E. Smith's askance appellation engine.</p><p>
    
    ""Mere Imposters"" deals with a formal apple-bobbing competition at a
    dinner party supervised by the waitstaff; ""Have You No Shame, Girl?""
    depicts a catfight between dancing girls.  I'm at a loss to figure
    out what ""Not a Hoot!"" is about, even though I find it ar
    irresistible bayou-bounce complete with gris-gris guitars and
    menacing backbeats.</p><p>
    
    But what I find so engrossing about <em>Low Kick and Hard Bop</em> isn't
    the samples, it's how Esselink combines them and submits them to her
    idiosyncratic style. It's quite a feat to take quirky elements from
    so many diverse sources and make them coherent, to the extent that I
    don't even register that they're samples. They become part of the
    Solex entity. Even Esselink's vocal mannerism wavers, but remains
    unmistakably Solex.  From swamp-thing growl to Tanya
    Donelly-does-a-Kathleen-Hanna-Valley-Girl-rant, Esselink stamps these
    styles with the Solex identity. Her ability to integrate discordant
    and heterogeneous elements leads me to believe that if Esselink was a
    shift manager at Subway, rather than a record shop owner, she'd as
    effortlessly construct something unique from three-day-old veggies
    and moldy bologna.</p><p>
    
    Yet the consistency of Solex material is potentially the agent of its
    own downfall. Play <em>Solex vs. the Hitmeister</em> after <em>Low Kick
    and Hard Bop</em> and you might think that they were recorded at the same
    time, rather than four years apart.  <em>Low Kick Hard Bop</em> offers
    nothing essentially different than past Solex releases.  While I'm
    not asking for a duet with Peaches or a remix by the Streets, I would
    appreciate a new facet to the customary lo-fi diamond boogaloo.  I
    quizzed the Pitchfork precogs with a 'wither Solex?' question.  While
    two out of three precogs foresaw a sequin-and-Appletini future for
    Esselink in Vegas, I prefer the less radical modification to Solex as
    described in the dissenting report. Time will tell if the minority
    precog and I will be thoroughly satisfied.</p></div>"|7324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7324-low-kick-and-hard-bop/|6.8|Paul Cooper

    position of being ""one of the other Japanese bands.""  Though they share a sound
    with some of the other Japanese artists to penetrate the U.S. indie rock scene,
    they lacked Cornelius' vision, never came close to the touch and refinement of
    Takako Minekawa, and as for Shonen Knife, well... okay, they do just about
    everything better than Shonen Knife.  But still, though they've consistently
    come up with a great track or two per release, Buffalo Daughter has never
    distinguished themselves in any way. They're as eclectic as their peers, but
    something has been missing on previous releases for Grand Royal.</p><p>
    
    After hearing this, their first record for Emperor Norton, I've finally figured
    out what it is: the songs. Buffalo Daughter produce exceptional-sounding tracks
    that cover a wide spectrum of genres, texture and mood; they perform well on a
    variety of instruments, and their voices blend nicely most of the time.  But
    they don't write great songs-- too often, they don't even write good ones.
    Though they're genre-hopping like mad, and making all the sounds pretty, if you
    have people singing and you're adhering to pop structure, you best be writing
    some songs.  So as usual, <em>I</em> has few standouts.</p><p>
    
    The first of these is the fantastically catchy riff-rocker ""28 Nuts."" After an
    extended intro that sounds like the band tuning up in front of an orchestra, the
    crunch takes over, and Buffalo Daughter sound like the Primitives with the vocals
    pitched down an octave.  Forget that the crude two-chord riff is the mirror image
    of the hook that drove ""Great Five Lakes""-- this is still a great track.  Also
    fine is the title track, which does away with the electricity and opts for dreamy
    Brazilian pop, complete with some heartwarming flute.  A half-notch below these
    is the midtempo, harmony-laden ""Mirror Ball,"" which has the prettiest melody on
    the album but eventually wears out its welcome as it passes the seven-minute mark.
    ""Discotheque du Paradis"" is an engaging slice of roller-rink pop with an
    unexpected Kraftwerk sample.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <em>I</em> displays admirable diversity, but no great songs. The
    lumbering ""Earth Punk Rockers"" has a proggy cast to it and wants to sound like
    the Flaming Lips' ""The Gash,"" but ultimately the poor singing and non-existent
    melody sink it.  ""Robot Sings (As If He Were Frank Sinatra with a Half-Boiled
    Egg and the Salt Shaker on a Breakfast Table)"" has a nice-enough title and, yes,
    vocodered vocals, but the limp structure just kind of lays there.  All told,
    <em>I</em> is far from a terrible record, but Buffalo Daughter only skim the
    surface of greatness, flirting with a myriad of styles without ever perfecting
    any of them.</p></div>"|1007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1007-i/|6.3|Mark Richard-San

    'completists,' the fanatics who will not rest until they own every b-side,
    guest appearance, and bootleg by their favorite artist.  If so, then reviews
    probably don't affect your purchasing habits.  However, the central reason most
    everyone else in the world buys music is neither familial relationships or
    fanaticism.  Nope.  It's this: they want to listen to it.  If this reflects your
    experience, then pay close attention: <em>do not buy this album</em>.</p><p>
<em>Blobscape</em> is the third solo recording from Karate and Secret Stars
    principal Geoff Farina.  Farina plays guitar-- and in late 2001, he recorded
    over 100 instrumental improvisations, 16 of which he released to CD.  Restated
    colloquially, for emphasis: <em>Blobscape</em> is a recording of improvisational
    guitar noodling.  Sixteen tracks' worth!</p><p>
    
    Unleashing solo guitar recordings on the public puts Farina in a class with such
    <em>Guitar World</em> regulars as Michael Hedges, Tim Reynolds and Eric Johnson.
    All accomplished technically, no doubt, but have you ever felt compelled to buy
    their albums?  Probably not. After all, most of the time, contemporary solo
    guitar lacks for nearly every desirable musical quality: melody, rhythm,
    interesting dynamics-- pretty much what your average music enthusiast is
    looking for, save virtuoso ability.  And Farina can't even boast this.  Sure,
    he's pretty good, but it's not like he deserves his own signature Ibanez, let
    alone one with seven-strings, a vine fretboard inlay and cutaway carrying
    handle.  To use the vernacular, <em>Blobscape</em> features very few killer chops,
    blazing riffs or hot licks (especially the licks).</p><p>
    
    Let's see if we can cut Farina and his lickless noodling some slack. Perhaps
    creativity is his game: if it were, you'd expect the tracks to feature conceptual
    diversity, sonic uniqueness, and variety in playing style.  Alas, they don't.
    As it happens, each of the sixteen cuts on <i>Blobscape</i> sound pedestrian and
    very similar.  On each, you hear Farina spewing rapidly fingered arpeggios,
    almost-bluesy hammer-ons, and a bunch of abstract modal shit (my catch-all term
    for the stuff that sucked), without keeping a beat and without shifting guitar
    tone or tempo.  Furthermore, and not surprisingly, there is almost nothing
    structured to grab a hold of; rarely does Farina add anything approaching a
    melody or a groove. Much of it sounds like warmup exercises, and the rest sounds
    like half-dissonant, improvised abstraction.  If Farina's ideas are so brilliant,
    why not write them down and then work on improving them?  Just an idea.</p><p>
    
    This review could have consisted of three words: ""solo improvisational guitar,""
    with perhaps the addition of the prefix ""bad.""  The concept speaks for itself,
    albeit unpersuasively.  Is Geoff Farina your brother?  Do you work at Kim's
    Music and Video, where I plan to take a trip tomorrow?  If not, then I repeat,
    for the benefit of your pocketbook: <em>do not buy this album</em>.</p></div>"|2996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2996-blobscape/|1.0|Brad Haywood

A geeky 16-year-old caught in an
    explosion at Fabrictron's experimental Nuclear Textile Factory, Jimmy Krauser
    not only miraculously survived-- but also developed the unique power to
    transform his skin into a velvet-like substance at will.  Forgetting the
    'great power' part of the 'with great power comes great responsibility' adage,
    Jimmy set about fighting the rather pedestrian criminals of his quiet suburban
    Houston neighborhood, subduing shoplifters and underage drinkers by rubbing the
    soft, tiny hairs of his velvety forearm against their face.  Yet, save the
    occasional battle with arch-enemy Dr. Velour (same explosion, similar powers,
    evil, etc.), The Velvet Teen is an unremarkable superhero at best.</p><p>
    
    The mediocrity of Jimmy and his tactile battle against small-time wrongdoing is
    reflected in his soundtrack, <em>Out of the Fierce Parade</em>.  While Spider-Man
    gets to swing around buildings to facial-hair rock from members of Nickelback
    and Alice in Chains, the Velvet Teen's music is of the introspective Northwest
    indie-rock scene: music for rainy-day snuggling-- not rainy-night, upside-down,
    slobbery Kirsten Dunst kisses.  It's an appropriate matchup, though, as The
    Velvet Teen the costumed crusader and The Velvet Teen the musical trio both have
    the same general vibe: well intentioned, but not too original, and not very well
    executed.</p><p>
    
    The Velvet Teen are a trio from Cotati, California with a debut album produced
    by Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla.  Building most songs around singer/guitarist/key-tickler
    Judah Nagler's grand piano, the band favors long, slow-burning arrangements
    blanketed in Walla's usual fetish for the reverb knob.  Self-consciously soaring
    above it all is Nagler's falsetto-more-often-than-not voice, one that is <i>more
    than a little</i> reminiscent of a certain lazy-eyed Brit whose name rhymes with
    Yom Thorke.</p><p>
    
    But like the other 873 would-be Thommys straining their vocal cords these days,
    Nagler's lack of subtlety and restraint is a quick reminder of the original's
    considerable emoting skills.  Rarely deviating from the upper registers, Nagler's
    vox fail to underscore the tragi-slacker lyrics, blurring any and all sentiments
    into an incessant whine.  The music, meanwhile, belies a similarly obvious
    Radiohead lean, albeit one that sets too high a bar for the band-- imagine the
    fresh-faced and heavy-handed <em>Pablo Honey</em>-era grungers taking on the
    sleep-deprived paranoia of <em>OK Computer</em>.</p><p>
    
    This approach leaves <em>Out of the Fierce Parade</em> with a lot of interesting,
    if familiar, minor-key ideas lost amidst unwieldy five, six, and seven-minute-long
    navel-gazing arrangements.  ""A Special Gift for You"" and ""Into the Open"" manage to
    develop fairly effective dreamy environments, but would still benefit from a few
    days on the musical Atkins Diet.  The obesity of ""Red, Like Roses"" and ""Death,""
    however, goes right down to their genetics-- epics that take two or three minutes
    to charge up, while never paying any dividends once they finally get rolling.</p><p>
    
    When things are kept lean, short, and given a bit of a backbone transplant
    (""Radiapathy,"" or the synthy C.S. Lewis nod ""Caspian Can Wait""), The Velvet Teen
    sound much more alive, though still stuck in the shadow of their Anglophilia.
    Sorely in need of an editor, and without a direction or sound to call their own,
    the band never even comes close to the oddball density of the Henry Miller
    excerpt they provide in the CD inset (remind me to check <em>Tropic of Cancer</em>
    out from the library).  It ain't crime-fighting music-- hell, it ain't even
    crime-fighting <i>video game</i> music-- but this is one pathetic superhero
    that shouldn't be encouraged.</p></div>"|8433.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8433-out-of-the-fierce-parade/|4.7|Rob Mitchum

    metropolis, The International Association of Misanthropic Singer/Songwriters
    convenes for their secret, annual conference.  After a bitter welcome speech by
    chairman-at-large Elvis Costello, the conventioneers migrate to the piano bar
    for sour cocktails and punny piano jazz courtesy of association member Ben
    Folds.  Conversation topics focus largely on self-aggrandizing tales of how
    former bullies now quiver in the presence of their still puny, yet now famous
    victims, what a pain in the ass ex-girlfriends and ex-wives can be, and why
    after over thirty years of existence, the association is still predominated by
    middle-class white men.  At dinner, association members are served six courses
    of mediocre food, snarl sarcastically at the waiting staff, and play ironic word
    games while trying to ignore the infernal whining of recently disciplined
    Association Secretary Rivers Cuomo.  After a workshop on writing evil epithets
    to ex-band members (who may or may be pursuing litigation), the members retire
    to their uncomfortable hotel rooms to groan at the television and think up new
    synonyms for 'acrid.'</p><p>
    
    Sean Tillmann (aka Sean Na Na) would be one of the youngest attendees, sulking
    in the back at an indie table, passing notes on cocktail napkins and wondering
    why no one invited Cheap Trick.  Like his more famous brethren, Sean Na Na airs
    his complaints over an eminently catchy pop soundtrack.  On <em>My Majesty</em>,
    he largely sheds his folky, singer/songwriter persona in favor of full-band
    integration.  The broader instrumentation allows Sean the luxury of letting
    loose his power-pop persona, while deflecting a bit of the lyrical malice-- a
    nice move.  Compare the upbeat album opener ""Double Date"" (with its handclaps,
    tambourines, and assorted pop conceits) with the solo piano-ballad closer ""I
    Need a Girl"" and you'll get what I'm talking about.  It's easier to take Sean Na
    Na's tone in a pop song. The faux sincerity of the acoustic singer/songwriter
    schtick is a strange bedfellow to lyrics like, ""I need a sugar mommy to pay for
    me because these days I'm just not earning my keep.""</p><p>
    
    Conversely, Tillman does well when he keeps it light.  I never thought I'd say
    this, but overindulgence in self-conscious smartassery-- once a seemingly
    ubiquitous tendency in indie-pop circles-- is a welcome respite from his earnest,
    confessional peers. There's something to be said for the man who actually sings,
    ""The Easter Bunny came this year and brought no eggs,"" on ""Give Me a B-Side""
    (which, despite absence of organ, sounds somewhat like better-than-average Quasi).
    The jangly, new wave-tinged ""I Hate Saxophones"" is hilarious and notable for its
    inclusion of the line, ""All abandoned free jazz refugees should cooperate during
    questioning.""</p><p>
    
    Sean Na Na's lighthearted take on big power-pop affectation a la Cheap Trick
    predominates throughout the album.  The British Invasion-style would-be stadium
    rocker ""Grew into My Body"" (a look-who's-laughing-now tirade to a grade school
    bully) is a clear high point, as is the supremely pissed off, minor-keyed,
    lite-metal of ""Big Trouble.""</p><p>
<em>My Majesty</em> could be a great album-- or rather, Sean Na Na could be seated
    at the head of the Misanthropic Pop Convention table-- were it not for mediocre
    production (note to upcoming power-popsters, lo-fi is preferable to timid hi-fi).
    I really want this to be louder, and I have the volume turned as high as building
    regulations will allow.  Also, the single focus of the lyrics gets a little
    repetitive, especially when coupled with Sean Na Na's occasionally whiny vocals.
    That said, <em>My Majesty</em> is a considerable improvement on Sean Na Na's
    previous solo work.  Sour, silly self-loathing you can dance to-- hardly
    revolutionary, but not a bad ride.</p></div>"|7047.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7047-my-majesty/|6.6|Alison Fields

    fathering a dipshit. Daedalus' son Icarus reckoned himself such a player when he
    decided that flying higher than anywhere else on flimsy wings held together with
    wax (the Scotch tape of ancient Greece) was a good thing.  Icarus was killed when
    he plummeted into the sea after the heat of the Aegean sun melted away the wax
    on his wings.  It wasn't for another two thousand years or so that Leonardo
    Da Vinci thought about winged flight-- Icarus' stupidity put everyone but the
    Renaissance genius off the idea of becoming birdy.</p><p>
    
    Daedalus, though, was a shrewd man.  He constructed one or two questionable
    things, and chief amongst them was a cow.  Yes, Daedalus fulfilled a request
    from King Minos' wife Pasiphae to make her a cow costume so that she could fuck
    a bull that the sea god Poseidon had sent for Minos to sacrifice in order to
    confirm his right to rule over Crete.  I suppose he looked at the project as
    more of an engineering challenge than as some kinky request from a sovereign's
    wife who could have him decapitated if he didn't comply. Despite his successful
    completion of the task and Pasiphae's successful impregnation by Poseidon's bull,
    Daedalus still ended up in the chokey.  I guess Minos wasn't too pleased when
    his wife gave birth to the half-human, half-bull chimera, the Minotaur.  But
    before throwing him in the clink, Minos did order Daedalus to construct the
    labyrinth in which Minos imprisoned the Minotaur.  All in all, a pretty remarkable
    figure, this Daedalus bloke.</p><p>
    
    As you'd expect, anyone adopting Daedalus' name (albeit with a tiny alteration
    in spelling) takes on a slew of pre-conceived notions. Fortunately, the gorgeous
    and nigh-on-unique <em>Invention</em> is more than worthy of assuming the name of
    its ancient Greek forbearer. Daedelus takes downtempo IDM and adds the naivety
    of childhood and the poignancy of Tin Pan Alley ballad arrangements. Just as
    Dntel's <em>Life Is Full of Possibilities</em> charmed me out of my IDM ennui
    last year, so too has <em>Invention</em>. </p><p>
    
    Daedelus' combination of Mush-style beats with the dew-eyed nostalgia of 1940s
    and 1950s string arrangements may seem awkward on paper, but nowhere does the
    combination of avant electronics and strings jar or sound forced.  Daedelus has
    realized what the downtempo elite Broadway Project and Bonobo have known for a
    while now: contrast need not disturb. Throughout <em>Invention</em>, I'm amazed at
    how complementary the opposites sound. During ""Playing Parties,"" a low frequency
    sawtooth sound emerges from the skirts of a stately, stomping concert grand piano
    into a glitched-up clockwork world of nursery toys. Daedelus presents a sound
    picture of gentle chimes and bells and whirs, then ushers in the star attraction--
    a synthetic melody line every bit as romantic as the one Jega used on his
    stand-out ""Geometry.""</p><p>
    
    The opening string ensemble sample that begins ""Pursed Lips Reply"" recalls the
    wistful poignancy of the Hollywood String Quartet's accompaniment to Frank
    Sinatra's 1957 album <em>Close to You</em>, a sentiment builds throughout the
    track.  Daedelus recasts that 50s nostalgia with ""Astroboy,"" a complexly
    arranged tune with segmented spoken word narration. It's like Brian Aldiss'
    short story ""Super-Toys Last All Summer Long"" (the foundation for Kubrick/Spielberg's
    <em>A.I.</em>) retold for first-graders.  Remarkably, the chopped story of a robot
    wondering about its identity is never cloying or even, in fact, resolved.</p><p>
    
    For ""Adventress,"" Daedelus pulls a woodwind ensemble out of retirement and gives
    them wistful melodies of their forgotten youth to dwell upon.  ""Quiet Now"" is as
    close to conventional downtempo as <em>Invention</em> gets. Over a lolloping EQ'd
    rhythm track a processed guitar works counter-rhythms.  By contrast, ""Perchance
    a Bit"" is John Surman's bass clarinet soundclashing with Jega's electronics.
    ""Soulful of Child"" recalls some of Squarepusher's least spastic jazz-n-bass, a
    style that Daedelus taps more frenetically for ""Thus the Whirligig.""</p><p>
    
    Two bonus cuts chart <em>Invention</em>'s progression from childhood naivety to
    savvy maturity.  Daedelus invites guest MCs Busdriver and Sach to rhyme over
    ""Quiet Now"" and ""Pursed Lips Reply.""  Busdriver's and Sach's stagy delivery and
    avant-poetry message locate them squarely in Mush/cLOUDDED territory.  However,
    while I appreciate these rhymes on their own, they do squelch the overall mood
    of the record in this context.</p><p>
    
    Still, Daedelus' debut album manages to find common ground between 21st century
    electronics and the string arrangements of yesteryear.  He never obscures one
    with the other, nor allows one to shine through at the other's expense.  The
    disparate elements are in harmony and at the command of Daedelus' personality.
    It could have gone so horribly wrong. Daedelus could have ventured too far into
    the mawkish, or equally astray in search of David Lynchian oddity. <em>Invention</em>
    has very few peers, in my opinion.  Though Schlammpeitzinger's <em>Collected
    Simple Songs of My Temporary Past</em> and Andrew Coleman's <em>Everything Was
    Beautiful and Nothing Hurt</em> come close, I'm firmly resigned that I'll not
    hear a more effortlessly charming album this year.</p></div>"|2129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2129-invention/|8.8|Paul Cooper

Assuming you're literate
    and that you live somewhere other than an ammunition-fortified Al-Qaeda tunnel,
    you don't need to hear that old <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> sob story again.
    So let's just say this: Tweedy is at the height of his success while making
    the most challenging music of his career-- not an easy feat by any measure.</p><p>
    
    And now, in conjunction with Wilco's latest opus, Tweedy has released his first
    recording under his own name, the soundtrack to Ethan Hawke's directorial debut
    <em>Chelsea Walls</em>.  Now, frankly, this isn't the kind of thing that's going
    to solidify his stardom.  For starters, there are only five 'real' songs, as
    we'll call them for convenience, and only two of them even feature him.  The
    record's other seven tracks comprise his score for the film, and though each is
    effective in its proper capacity as soundtrack music, most of it isn't the sort
    of stuff you're going to feel compelled to listen to time and again.</p><p>
    
    Consider the seven-minute opening titles, for example.  Tweedy layers swelling
    feedback and ambling guitar parts over Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche's sporadic
    percussion, but the loosely defined theme he plays isn't very commanding, and
    the sputtering vibes in the background don't help it congeal.  In short, it does
    what an effective soundtrack should do-- establish a mood or feeling without
    distracting you from what's going on.  The problem is that it doesn't make for
    very engaging listening outside of the context of the film. It gets more
    interesting toward the end, as Kotche's percussion rises in intensity and
    Tweedy's wall of sound grows thicker, but as a stand-alone piece, it never
    really arrives.</p><p>
    
    Part of the problem lies in the fact that each score track can be easily
    represented by a brief description of what happens in it.  For instance,
    ""Hello, Are You There?"" is ""the short one with the repetitive acoustic guitar
    and all the floaty keyboards on top,"" while ""Finale"" is ""the overlong one with
    the repetitive acoustic guitar and all the floaty keyboards on top.""  ""The
    Wallman"" builds a lovely texture with vibes and what sounds like a harmonium,
    but only gestures at building a piece of music with that texture.  Makes for
    wonderful sonic wallpaper, but that's about all I can say for it.</p><p>
    
    The remaining pieces each manage to hold their own on some level without visual
    accompaniment, with the sparse piano and cymbals of ""Frank's Dream"" sounding
    like the not-too-distant cousin of something Michael Krassner's Boxhead Ensemble
    might have dreamed up-- appropriate, as Tweedy appeared on that collective's
    last album.  In fact, most of the score pieces on this album reflect Tweedy's
    recent involvement with Chicago's improvisation-oriented underground musical
    exchange-- Kotche himself has been a mainstay on that same scene for years now.</p><p>
    
    The two most aggressive-- and memorable-- score pieces come at opposite ends of
    the disc.  ""Red Elevator"" follows the opening titles by swinging the vibe 180
    degrees.  Kotche lays down a heavy backbeat, over which Tweedy tosses off
    distorted riffs and some interesting manipulated feedback.  There's a primal
    drive to it that contrasts well with the rest of the music here, and it's likely
    to catch your attention mostly for that reason.  Better still is the music
    composed for the closing credits, wherein Tweedy weaves a gorgeous tapestry
    of themes and counterthemes on acoustic guitars over Kotche's subdued but steady
    drumming.</p><p>
    
    While the score pieces may not all be memorable, they at least have a consistent
    and seemingly coherent color and mood.  That flow is broken, however, by the five
    other songs tossed like so many cucumber slices into the salad of the tracklist.
    You won't mind when it's Wilco interrupting the flow, as their two contributions
    are easily the highlights of the album.</p><p>
    
    ""Promising"" is vintage acoustic Wilco, and would have fit beautifully on <em>Being
    There</em>'s second disc.  Tweedy spins an arresting ballad, bathed in dobro and
    fingerpicked guitars.  Even better is ""When the Roses Bloom Again,"" another
    leftover kicking around from the band's <em>Mermaid Avenue</em> sessions with
    Billy Bragg.  It was booted from the first album when they discovered the lyrics
    weren't actually Guthrie originals-- he had adapted a standard-- but it's easily
    the equal of any of the best material on either of them (<em>Mermaid Avenue, Vol.
    2</em> even cribbed the melody for ""Blood of the Lamb"").  Whoever wrote the lyrics,
    the humid swaths of slide guitar and organ bring the words to life in a way I'm
    sure would have impressed Guthrie himself.</p><p>
    
    That leaves three other songs, however, which are less essential diversions, and
    in the case of jazz man Jimmy Scott's contribution, considerably less pleasant.
    Scott's version of John Lennon's ""Jealous Guy"" is the only honest-to-god bad
    thing on <i>Chelsea Walls</i>, and the less said about his piercing, androgynous
    caterwauling and listless, loungy arrangement the better.  The final two tracks
    seem to be simply sound clips from the film, of actor Robert Sean Leonard, who
    plays a songwriter running through some material, one of which happens to be
    Wilco's ""The Lonely 1.""  Though hardly bad, they're also unnecessary and come
    across more as curiosities than fully developed, listenable songs.</p><p>
    
    So when the laser slides back across its little track and the disc stops spinning,
    what is there to say about <em>Chelsea Walls</em>?  Not much, I'm afraid.  Aside
    from a few mildly diverting pieces from Tweedy and Kotche and two excellent
    (and unfortunately, rare) songs, it has little to offer as an album divorced
    from the images that inspired it.  I suppose Wilco completists will want it for
    those two extra songs, but only you know whether you're that devoted.</p></div>"|8198.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8198-chelsea-walls/|6.3|Joe Tangari

He was
    something of a musical child prodigy, having learned to play bass, guitar,
    piano, cello and drums by the time he entered grade school.  Early on, he
    exhibited a desire to perform (inspired by his heroes Dion and the Belmonts,
    and having seen the Beatles perform at Shea Stadium), and at 12 years old was
    playing keyboards in a local garage band.  The band actually cut a single when
    Gary was in the eighth grade, and was successful enough to open for the
    bubblegum act 1910 Fruitgum Company.  After the band's vocalist left, Wilson
    took over, composing original material and leading the band through various

    However, Wilson quickly proved to be a bit eccentric for the band, and his music
    was becoming increasingly experimental. At 16, he picked up on the music of John
    Cage, and went so far as to send Cage manuscripts of his music.  To Wilson's
    surprise, Cage actually invited him to his home where they would discuss and
    critique the music for a couple of days.  Perhaps as a result, Wilson's band
    ventured into even stranger realms, and their gigs began to consist of three or
    four songs, followed by fights between band members and audience, who were
    throwing anything within reach at the stage. Wilson graduated from high school
    in 1970, and moved to New York City with his friend Vince Rossi (who plays
    trombone on one song on this record).</p><p>
    
    New York proved to be a tad rough for the boys, who were back in their hometown
    within weeks, living with their parents again. Wilson set up a studio in his
    parents' basement, spending countless nights working with magnetic recording
    tape and making the music that would become his only album.  This album, <i>You
    Think You Really Know Me</i>, was completed in 1977, and is a testament to
    Wilson's virtual one-man dogged determination and talent.  He pressed the record
    with his own money, and promoted it by mailing it to radio stations and music
    writers throughout the U.S. He sent along self-made press packages, including
    some pretty fucked-up photos (the one with Wilson covered in tape, staring at
    the camera in his underwear stands out). He even got some radio play, and in
    1978 moved to California in hopes of landing a record deal.  Of course, he never
    found one, though he did make a last-ditch tour cross-country, ending in 1981
    with a gig at CBGB's, and some very rare seven-inch EPs.  Since then, he's
    settled in California and retired from music.  One of his friends sent this
    album to Motel Records, and this reissue is the result.</p><p>
    
    So, now you know the story; be prepared for the unique cocktail-angst stylings
    that are Wilson's tunes.  The thing is, the music-- largely an odd combination
    of late 70s soft rock, proto-synth pop and experimental tape effects-- wouldn't
    seem half as strange if not for Wilson's raw, thoroughly unpolished vocals.
    Most of the time, he's out of tune, otherwise his voice is cracking, struggling
    to contain his enthusiasm when he blurts out stuff like, ""Oh, Jesus, she's so
    real!"" or emitting one of his trademark (well, copied from James Brown) ""hey's""
    or ""hoo's"".  Wilson, to his credit, is a great keyboardist and bassist, and
    pairs himself with an equally great drummer (Gary Iacovelli).  Furthermore,
    his production is clear and dynamic, suggesting that if he hadn't retired, he
    probably could have made a very fine producer or engineer.  Nevertheless, most
    people are going to focus on his voice, which is nothing if not unique.</p><p>
    
    The opener, ""Another Time I Could Have Loved You,"" gets things started on a
    very tense note, as Wilson's searing guitar mangles whatever shimmering backdrop
    his Fender Rhodes provides.  It lasts for just over a minute, and immediately
    leads into the very peppy ""You Keep On Looking.""  This tune is at once totally
    legitimate synth-pop, like a larval Erasure, and completely ridiculous. Wilson's
    aggressive vocals spit out declarations of loneliness (""Hey!  Foolish hearts,
    you're keeping me away, hey!""), sympathy (""I don't care that they call you a
    whore, it don't matter! Hey!"") to mistrust (""Your mind is full of imbalanced
    things, hey!"").  He often goes into rap-speak instead of carrying a tune.
    Luckily, his Kraftwerk-meets-Mr. Rogers keyboard arrangements keep the edge off.</p><p>
    
    ""6.4 = Make Out"" sees Wilson getting his groove on, Barry White style.  If Barry
    White was a creepy pervert, that is, or a horny teenager.  The low-down porno
    soundtrack groove perfectly frames Wilson's straight-faced horn-dog prose (""How
    old you say you were?""  -- ""Sixteen!"") and obsessive pining (""She's a real,
    she's a real groovy girl, and she's got red lips.  Can't you hear me god?
    She's a real groovy girl, and she's got red lips!  Man, she's so real!  She's
    so real!!"").  At one point, one of his recurring obsessions comes to the fore,
    when he admits to his current object of desire that his 'real crush' is on
    ""Karen.""  Karen pops up a couple of times on the record, as do Cathy and Cindy.
    Going to the dance on Friday night is a common topic, as is avoiding a ""sick trip.""
    It's pretty intense.</p><p>
    
    One of the truly creepy moments on the record comes with ""Loneliness,"" featuring
    Wilson's languished whisper (""Sometimes... I wish... I were... dead"") over what
    sounds like a cow getting slaughtered and dissonant keyboard clusters.  At the
    end, someone starts pouring out a bucket of water, and abusing a keyboard while
    a radio plays in the background.  Was I meant to hear this?  All is made well
    with ""Cindy,"" because apparently, she's the kind of girl who will let you walk
    her home ""late at night, about 12.""  She'll say, ""It's a real cool scene,"" and
    best of all, she'll tell you, ""It will be real cool with her,"" if you want to
    kiss her lips.  She'll even let you take her out as long as you pick her up ""by
    9:20.""  Cindy also gets the porno soundtrack treatment.  You know, I've listened
    to my share of Brian Wilson bootlegs where he's singing about teaching little
    girls to put on makeup, but this is just weird.</p><p>
    
    ""You Were Too Good to Be True"" is a fast and funky instrumental that would sound
    at home on ""The Price is Right"" when they're bringing out new prizes to bid on.
    ""Groovy Girls Make Love at the Beach"" moves along at a nice pace, like a cross
    between lounge acts playing Bee Gees in Las Vegas and more ""Price is Right""
    grooviness.  But then, Wilson decides to let the dwarves have some by injecting
    some helium-like vocals into the bridge.  ""She's out of reach, every single
    Friday night-- I'm not kidding now!""  Righteous.  Perhaps the most poignant
    music on the record happens during ""Chromium Bitch.""  Sure, Wilson is about
    twenty years too early to turn fantasy-misogyny into a pop song (""I want to make
    you my Chromium Bitch.  My bitch, hey!""), but this kind of unadulterated teen
    bravado is <i>You Think You Really Know Me</i>'s calling card.  That Wilson was
    in his twenties when he made this record shouldn't sway your judgment too much.</p><p>
    
    There have been a few hipsters to latch onto this record (most notably, Beck,
    who name checks him in ""Where It's At""), though I wonder how many are taking it
    as a joke.  It seems to me Wilson was dead serious with this stuff, and though
    that results in some pretty awkward moments, you could hardly call it a joke.
    Of course, I laughed a few times when I first heard this, but the lasting effect
    is actually fairly dark.  If you can stand some indulgence on Wilson's part, and
    are willing to part with your irony filter for about an hour, you might be
    surprised at how this affects you.  Or you could put it on to freak with your
    roommate.  It's all good.</p></div>"|8694.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8694-you-think-you-really-know-me/|7.7|Dominique Leone

    just gonna come right out and say it: jazz is dead.  That sound you
    hear is a thousand jazz afficiados snorting in disgust as they roll
    their eyes and take another puff on their morning cigar-- but their
    opinion is biased and irrelevant anyway.  To the rest of the world
    in the 21st century, jazz exists only as deluxe-packaged re-re-re-reissues,
    PBS documentaries, and hip-hop sample material.  Sure, its influence
    has sunk into the genetic material of everyone from Tortoise to Tribe,
    but pure, un-hyphenated Jazz has grown into nothing more than a stagnant
    pond surrounded by a scene that makes indie rock look downright populist.</p><p>
    
    Yet there's still a few post-mortem muscle spasms running through the
    old corpse, most notably the Brooklyn keyboard/bass/drum trio Medeski,
    Martin, and Wood.  Chastised by the jazz community for associating with
    those godawful hippie jam bands (a genre most jazzbos hold about one
    notch above Manheim Steamroller and Zamfir), MMW have nonetheless done
    more than just about any other act in recent years to continue pushing
    the genre into new fields.  Taking the relaxed-rules approach to
    improvisation practiced by the better of the jammy folk, and adding a
    healthy, non-patronizing dollop of hip-hop to their Tipitina's funk,
    they've expanded jazz's vocabulary while still appealing to a crowd
    beyond subscribers to <em>The Wire</em> and regulars down by the Electric
    Factory.</p><p>
    
    While MMW albums have the tendency to function merely as sketchpads
    for future embellishment on the concert stage, recent collaborations
    with producer/engineer Scotty Hard have proved remarkably successful
    as bona fide Albums.  Hard, who's worked with the likes of Wu-Tang
    Clan and Kool Keith, lent the Caucasian trio enough street cred
    confidence to experiment with DJs and a raunchy collection of keys
    on the creepy <em>Combustication</em>, and to teeter on the brink of
    the noise-o-sphere on <em>The Dropper</em>.  Violating traditional
    jazz recording laws, MMW used overdubbing (gasp!) and post-production
    editing (well I never!) to make an increasingly spacey roar that
    rarely came unglued from their characteristically tight, deep groove.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, <em>Uninvisible</em>, the third time around the block with Hard,
    ain't quite got the charm.  Not that it's a bad album, or a step back
    for the band-- if anything, it's a step sideways, as much of the
    territory explored sounds like doubling back rather than journeying
    onwards.  ""Your Name Is Snake Anthony,"" with jam band patriarch Col.
    Bruce Hampton doing the spoken-word thing over the band's abstract
    wallpaper, is <em>Combustication</em>'s ""Whatever Happened to Gus"" with
    lamer poetry.  ""Pappy Check"" and ""The Edge of Night,"" both turntable
    jams with DJ Olive, recall better work with DJ Logic who more easily
    found the rare chinks in MMW's sound that call for vinyl theatrics.
    Medeski, meanwhile, seems to have finally run out of keyboards to
    pound on, having added mellotron, toy piano, and the ever-popular
    ""sequential circuits."" </p><p>
    
    The large stable of special guests brought into liven things up also
    succumb to a bit of a stylistic rut-- even when the tactic occasionally
    works, it's merely functional.  A full horn section appears with the
    band for the first time since their more traditional jazz-funk days,
    but the brass on the title track and ""Nocturnal Transmissions"" is so
    filtered, faded, and generally fucked about that it resembles the
    astro-Mingus of Radiohead's ""The National Anthem."" Eddie Bobe utilizes
    a veritable arsenal of percussive oddities against Medeski's mini-Moog
    squiggling on ""Retirement Song,"" a song that tense and itchy as an
    allergy attack. </p><p>
    
    Nonetheless, many tracks come off as retreads or ideas freeze-dried
    for consumption at the trio's famous exhaustingly intense live shows.
    I can just imagine the chicken-shack organ throwdown ""Smoke""-- a lean
    2:48 on record-- being stretched out to the length of a sitcom while
    smelly kids in the latest hempwear draw curly, imaginary amoebas in
    the air with splayed fingers.  (God, I miss my innocent jam band days.)
    So while <em>Uninvisible</em> doesn't succeed as a compelling prize copy
    of the Medeski, Martin and Wood home game, it's still an interesting
    listen that proves their relevancy in the Real World, rather than the
    Jazz World.  Do you think any other new jazz releases this year will
    coincidentally use the same ping-pong ball sampling effect as the new
    Anti-Pop Consortium?  Fat chance, Wynton.</p></div>"|5201.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5201-uninvisible/|6.3|Rob Mitchum

Kim Deal's got a million of 'em.  How else could she manage
    to put off releasing her first original music in six years, not to mention
    following up on <em>Last Splash</em>, the radio and retail-friendly juggernaut
    from <em>nine</em> years ago?</p><p>
    
    ""I haven't found the right drum sound,"" she'd say to engineer after engineer.
    ""I'm going to take some time off and learn how to play the drums myself"" (she's
    been working that one since 1995, when Tammy and the Amps-- Deal's basement solo
    project-- eventually became The Amps, with ex-Breeders drummer Jim Macpherson).
    ""I can't do this without Kelley,"" she'd tell interviewers, despite having toured
    as the Breeders in 1997 with a Kelley-less lineup that included Macpherson, the
    Amps' Nate Farley, and violinist/vocalist Carrie Bradley.  As engineers, studios
    and musicians were discarded as casually as cigarettes, and potential release
    dates came and went, the vultures-- and VH-1's <em>Behind the Music</em>-- started
    circling.  Legend even has it that Kim Deal, having spent the Breeders' royalties
    and advance money long ago, has been living on fees generated by the Prodigy's
    ""Firestarter,"" a song that, fortunately for Deal, sampled <em>Last Splash</em>'s
    ""S.O.S.""</p><p>
    
    After years of being just around the corner like that Hopi Indian freak in
    <em>Mulholland Drive</em>, at last <em>Title TK</em> is upon us. And it's not bad.
    Far from being the chilly product of Deal's reputed perfectionism and production
    overkill, <em>Title TK</em> is a loose, spontaneous, even messy affair, and a blast
    to listen to once Deal's pop curiousities begin to take shape in the listener's
    imagination.  Steve Albini should get a stipend from Nike for finally corralling
    Deal in his Chicago studio, convincing her to can the excuses and just do it.</p><p>
    
    ""Round up, holler girl,"" are the first words from Kim Deal's mouth in six years,
    on opener ""Little Fury,"" a rough-edged call-and-response with divebombing guitars,
    driving bass, and sister Kelley's dissonant harmonies.  ""Hold what you've got,""
    Deal rasps on the chorus as hired guns Richard Presley and Mondo Lopez
    (of Los Angeles punk band Fear) and drummer Jose Medeles pound out a labored
    groove.  Forget <em>Last Splash</em> and The Amps-- <em>Title TK</em> picks up
    where <em>Pod</em> left off in 1989, with a jagged sound nowhere near as tight
    as the Pixies' but a heartfelt enthusiasm for creating music.  ""Yeah, I'm
    leaking pure white noise,"" Deal sings on ""London Song.""  It's not the most accurate
    statement, as this ain't exactly Merzbow, but it's an accurate reflection of
    what the Breeders are shooting for with <em>Title TK</em>: something uncomplicated,
    as pure and unaffected as static.</p><p>
    
    While the Thom Yorke school of songwriters, bored with conventional pop structures,
    slice their music apart and reconstruct it digitally like a Burroughs novel, Deal's
    latest compositions are disjointed by design-- trying on and chucking lyrical
    ideas and musical motifs with abandon, almost elevating ADD to a kind of art
    form.  ""Dumb as a fuckin'... and missing from the party,"" Deal sings in ""Little
    Fury.""  Dumb as a fuckin' <em>what</em>?  Attempting to decode <em>Title TK</em>'s
    musical Mad Libs can be maddening-- it's easier to let Deal slur her words and
    catch the occasional fragments of brilliance that only weed-fueled midnight
    recording sessions and happy accidents can produce.</p><p>
<em>Title TK</em> also finds Deal dabbling with new sounds, with hit-and-miss
    results.  ""The She"" is built around a Stereolab-ish keyboard vamp, and while
    you shouldn't expect grooves as tight as Le Tigre's, the Breeders'
    rough-and-tumble brand of funk is convincingly nasty.  But the silly slap-back
    percussion of ""Sinister Foxx"" and Record Engineering 101 channel-swapping
    guitars on ""Huffer"" aren't exactly cutting edge.  Still, when the Breeders set
    out to rock-- and the chugging guitars and stomping drums of standout ""Son of
    Three"" <i>will</i> bring a knowing smile to Pixies afficianados-- they get the
    job done.</p><p>
<em>Title TK</em> also contains two unexpectedly beautiful songs-- the disarmingly
    spare ""Off You,"" with its lonesome guitar and gorgeous bass solo, is some of the
    creepiest headphone listening since <em>The Wall</em>.  ""I've never seen a starlet,
    or a riot, or the violence of you,"" Deal sings in a weary, muted voice.  ""I am
    the autumn in the scarlet, I am the makeup on your eyes.""  ""Forced to Drive,"" a
    woozy travelogue bouyed by shimmering arpeggios and effects-pedal-to-the-metal
    choruses, merges <em>Last Splash</em>'s summery hangover with the Velvets' ""Ride
    into the Sun.""</p><p>
    
    ""Title TK"" is journalistic shorthand for ""title to come,"" and <em>Title TK</em>
    does feel incomplete in many ways-- from the hand-scribbled song titles on the
    back sleeve to the sometimes tuneless (and always somewhat haphazard) delivery
    of the vocals.  Keyboards buzz from out of nowhere, guitars hit bum notes
    intentionally, basslines amble up and down the scale, sometimes two at a time.
    When <em>Title TK</em> loses people-- and I suspect it'll lose many-- it'll be
    with the langorous, abstract half-songs like ""Put on a Side"" (a listless
    anti-song built around a fretless bass groove, spare guitar and a single piano
    note) or ""Sinister Foxx"" (largely a meditation on the repeated phrase ""Has
    anyone seen the iguana?"").</p><p>
    
    And for an album so highly anticipated for so long, <em>Title TK</em> feels
    awfully skimpy, at just over 38 minutes, and pretty shamelessly padded.  Did
    we really need the two false endings and an extended jam that stretches ""London""
    past the three-minute mark?  Or the rockabilly remake of The Amps' ""Full on
    Idle,"" which barely deviates from the original?  Isn't the two-minute ""T and
    T"" essentially just an extended instrumental intro to the short, sharp ""Huffer""?
    Deal has been flogging many of these songs since that 1997 Breeders outing,
    including ""Forced to Drive"" (released on a fanclub single way back when), ""Too
    Alive,"" and ""Huffer.""  And what about Kelley's ""Fire the Maid,"" a live favorite
    discarded from <em>Title TK</em> at the eleventh hour?</p><p>
    
    Still, it's a hell of a lot of fun to hear these fortysomething twins still
    singing about whippets and the quality of Jersey weed, and when the Breeders are
    on, they're still <em>on</em>.  Just don't come to <em>Title TK</em> expecting the
    note-perfect pop confections of ""Cannonball"" or ""Divine Hammer,"" because it's
    not that kind of record.  And let's hope nobody samples <i>Title TK on their
    big hit single, or it might be another ten years before the next one.</i></p></div>"|923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/923-title-tk/|7.4|Will Bryant

I'm not just talking to your run-of-the-mill
    'brink,' either.  The Charm City is retarded in so many powerful ways that it
    pushes men towards the bizarre and inconceivable.  Take my beloved brother, Dr.
    Steve Haywood, for example.  Prior to moving to Baltimore, he was devoted to
    three average, respectable pursuits: jogging, auto restoration and dentistry.
    Then came his Baltimorphosis: upon moving to the city, Dr. Steve immediately
    felt compelled to drop all else in an effort to master <em>swing dancing</em>,
    shaming my dear parents, and leading us all to ask what went wrong.  Don't blame
    yourself, Mom; it was just Baltimore.</p><p>
    
    One glance at Ink's sophomore LP, <em>Reagent Specs</em>, suggests that they, too,
    have been afflicted by Baltimore's insidious 'charm.'  The liner notes proudly
    attest that <em>Reagent Specs</em> was ""written and recorded <em>simultaneously</em>
    at ACR, Baltimore, MD.""  In other words, they just booked ACR and waited for
    something cool to happen.  Sounds crazy, eh?  Like something you'd like advance
    warning about just so you could avoid it?  Right, well, maybe it sounds that way
    on paper, but the results are fantastic.</p><p>
    
    Whatever the point of the disclaimer, it's rather striking because, fact is,
    the album sounds calculated, like something that comes with its own theory.
    Instead of reflecting a 'found sound' aesthetic, <em>Reagent Specs</em> sounds
    practiced, polished and richly creative.  The restrained post-rock of Slint is
    an instant and undeniable reference point, as Ink similarly brood on shady bass
    and drum rhythms.  Guitarist Craig Bowen (ex-Science Kit) works his hardest to
    draw new and interesting noises from his axe, including harmonics, feedback, and
    string-scratches.  The guitar work, combined with some unique percussion
    (congas, junkyard implements), adds a jittery unease that prevails throughout
    the disc.  Then there's the dispassionate delivery of vocalist Peter Quinn
    (formerly of the Baltimore-based hardcore band Candy Machine), which carves
    out meditative, quasi-melodic lines that, united with his mantra-esque lyrics,
    add a final measure of abstraction to the mix.</p><p>
    
    The ensemble achieves its best results on two early tracks: ""Stereo Eyes""
    captures the spirit of anxiety with a steady, funkless monotone bassline
    undergirding random guitar embellishments and lyrics about lucid dreaming.
    ""Industrial Schemes"" follows a different tack, dominated by the rhythmic
    elements: a restful, placid bass groove and a lazy, pulsing drumbeat which
    Quinn punctuates with rhythmic, stream-of-consciousness vocals.</p><p>
    
    For an album recorded under the oddest of conditions in one of the bleakest,
    least attractive cities in North America (and the former murder capitol of the
    world), <em>Reagent Specs</em> certainly is a fortuitous result, surprisingly
    palatable and accessible. And unlike its place of production, it doesn't grind
    or annoy, let alone stink, rot or die.</p></div>"|4099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4099-reagent-specs/|8.0|Brad Haywood

    singer/songwriter sensitivity, look no further.  Ed Harcourt has
    arrived, and he's got exactly what you need.  A recent expulsion from
    Headmaster DiCrescenzo's School for Emotionally Fragile Male
    Singer/Songwriters, Ed was retained by the program long enough to
    learn some by-the-book songwriting techniques, but his insistence on
    sweeping orchestration led to dismissal before he could complete the
    most important portions of the curriculum.  What Harcourt failed to
    learn while enrolled was that his brand of orchestral folk-pop needs
    substance (or a healthy sense of humor) to survive.</p><p>
    
    Now some of you might be wondering how Ed can be accused of being a
    hack when brain-dead pop outfits, like, say, Phantom Planet get the
    go-ahead to dumb down the nation's youth?  Well, it all comes down
    to craftsmanship.  Great pop songwriters like Elvis Costello or
    a young Bowie could have written classic songs about the phone book;
    they approached their material with a true sense of invention and the
    desire to craft songs that would not only appeal to the masses, but
    be creative and infectious enough to smooth-talk their way into the
    deepest recesses of the public consciousness.  Middle-of-the-road
    acts (Sarah Shannon, Weezer, etc) make up for what they lack in
    creativity or brains with energy and interesting spins on old genres,
    and are at least able to wring out songs nuanced enough to warrant a
    few subsequent listens.</p><p>
    
    If the best of the best write pop for the ages, and the runners-up
    write pop for today, then Ed excels at single-listen music.  Once
    you've sampled his array of string swells, backing horns, and amateur
    piano the first time through, you realize that the depths of these
    songs could be plumbed with a toothpick. Harcourt writes like a
    supermodel: pretty but shallow.  Not only in the sense of intellectual
    content (though that's in short supply here), but simply in the fact
    that <em>Here Be Monsters</em> doesn't have a payoff.  Once you strip
    the polished veneer from the songs with the initial listen, further
    attempts leave nothing for subsequent discovery.  Other bands might
    get away with this on intensity alone, but Harcourt's straightforward,
    predictable manner leaves his wan material desperately lacking.</p><p>
    
    Considering the minimal tone of most of these tracks, Harcourt's
    vocal is miserably distant and unimpassioned-- he might as well be
    mumbling in his sleep.  He rarely provides the intimacy necessary to
    sell what he's singing, destroying the most vital aspect of his work.
    Given the uniform rhythm of almost the entire album and the aimless,
    meandering sort of chamber-pop background to these tracks, it all
    comes off as half-hearted.  Now, there's nothing wrong with
    sleepytime music, but only if it has the requisite sense of closeness
    to the work, which Ed ain't got.   There's no one aspect of <i>Here Be
    Monsters</i> that's faulty in and of itself-- the sparse instrumentation,
    plodding rhythms, and arms-length vocals combine almost equally to
    sabotage this solo flight.</p><p>
    
    For most of its 51 minutes, <em>Here Be Monsters</em> lumbers along at
    the same mind-numbing pace, and Harcourt is content to offer up the
    same basic formula again and again.  There are slight variations in
    his staccato piano, or where (but not how) the strings come in,
    leading to a few first-among-equals tracks as ""Like Only Lovers Can""
    and ""Hanging with the Wrong Crowd.""  There's also a lone standout,
    for what it's worth-- on ""Shanghai,"" Ed conjures up enough energy
    to finally let 'er rip on the vocals, and the melody is actually
    up-tempo.  It's the closest this record comes to anything even
    remotely approximating rock.  It's by no means a masterpiece, but
    in light of the other tracks, it differentiates itself by simply,
    mercifully, breaking the pace and actually being enjoyable.  If only
    there were a few more like it, or more beneath the surface.</p><p>
    
    Folk-pop a la Ed Harcourt doesn't necessarily need to be intelligent,
    or very complicated.  Pop legends like the Beach Boys and
    singer/songwriter greats like Elliott Smith probably won't be the
    focus of a Psych term paper anytime soon, but they've written songs
    of enduring value-- the fourth-year curriculum Ed never received.
    On <em>Here Be Monsters</em>, Harcourt masks the underlying transience
    of his work with hollow instrumentation, but it's hard to miss that
    there's nothing at the root.</p></div>"|3739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3739-here-be-monsters/|4.0|Eric Carr

    at the top of his game?  Mathew Herbert is pretty much unstoppable
    right now, a one-man juggernaut assaulting the world of electronic
    music on several fronts: high-profile experimental pop under his own
    name, underground releases as Doctor Rockit, Radioboy and Wishmountin
    (some of which are available free) and collaborations too numerous to
    mention-- all packaged with biting anti-globalism dogma which you can
    pay attention to or ignore without affecting your appreciation of the
    music in the slightest.  His beat programming is always on time,
    he's writing vocal melodies to rival prime Stereolab, and he's a
    sampling theorist on par with Matmos or DJ Shadow.  This guy is
    firing on all cylinders.</p><p>
    
    As one would expect of a busybody electronic producer such as
    Herbert, he does a lot of remixing, and the two-disc <em>Secondhand
    Sounds</em> collects 21 of his post-production tweaks created over the
    past six years.  It's definitely one of the best remix albums ever,
    but given how many shitty ones are clogging the used bins, that
    statement doesn't tell you much about the record's quality.  What I
    like so much about <em>Secondhand Sounds</em> is Herbert's imperialistic
    way with the source material.  As he makes clear in his manifesto,
    only sounds from the original work are included, but he completely
    twists them to his own ends, giving his remixes the most distinctive
    sonic signature this side of Markus Popp.  The result is a collection
    that feels cohesive and works as an album.  The source material may
    not be his, but the thing is pure Herbert from the first vocal sample
    forward.</p><p>
    
    Part of what makes Herbert's production so distinctive is his quirky
    sense of rhythm.  House beats are his stock in trade, but each track
    is given a slight variation of Herbert's trademark shuffle, where
    ever-so-slightly awkward accents are placed around the standard bass
    drum/high-hat pattern.  It helps, too, that he's such a firm believer
    in sound transformation; the familiar cymbal hisses have a timbre
    that's just a bit off, and the drumbeats have a glitchy twist that
    always sounds fresh.  The structure of the song can remain intact,
    or not, depending on the effect that Herbert is going for. But there's
    no doubt when listening to each track that it's the product of
    meticulous design.</p><p>
    
    Many of the original tracks are obscure, at least to me, but with the
    presence of Herbert always foregrounded, that's neither here nor
    there.  Nils Peter Moivaer's ""Merciful"" is a feast of melancholia;
    the opening chords and vocals are at first pinched, as if sourced
    from an old 78, and then piano chords and a spare beat leave plenty
    of room for the chanteuse-style lead to blossom.  The ethereal Two
    Banks of Four track ""Street Lullaby"" is another piano ballad, livened
    up with blocky percussion and underpinnings of distortion.  Terra
    Deva's ""Fresh Start"" takes longer to develop, with lonely organ and
    vocals dominating the first minute and half, until a bubbly bassline
    and jerky beats bring it to life.  Herbert's funky and propulsive
    remix of Serge Gainsbourg's ""Bonnie and Clyde"" shows how brilliantly
    he makes good source material seem even cooler, transforming others'
    work merely by accent into brand new songs.</p><p>
    
    Six of the tracks are remixes of Herbert's own material, including
    the <em>Bodily Functions</em> tracks ""Suddenly,"" which is given an
    aggressively rhythmic slice-and-dice dub treatment, and ""The Last
    Beat,"" which removes most of the vocals and inserts sharp percussion
    figures.  It's a testament to Herbert's approach that these two sound
    like they could be original tracks in their own right.  And that's
    pretty much the story all down the line.  Take a guy with serious
    skill who actually gives a shit about remixing and you get
    <em>Secondhand Sounds</em>, one of the finest records of its kind.</p></div>"|3832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3832-secondhand-sounds/|9.0|Mark Richard-San

As
    I write this, porches in my neighborhood are enjoying maximum
    occupancy as folks sip tea, guzzle beer, stare into space, smoke
    cigarettes, smoke joints, sing softly to themselves, wave to
    strangers on the street-- you know, that usual peaceful springtime
    stuff.  But even though all seems calm and relaxed, there's a sense
    of discomfort lurking just beneath the idyllic veneer, as every
    Chicagoan knows that they might wake up tomorrow to rainstorms and
    frigid wind.</p><p>
    
    This ability at masking uneasiness with a stoic, well-practiced
    relaxed calm comes through on <em>It Isn't the Fall</em>, the second
    release by the Chicago-based Lesser Birds of Paradise.  The Lesser
    Birds are yet another band cranking out alt-country flavored Indie
    Brand pop music.  Like so many other bands like them, I can't bring
    myself to hate the Lesser Birds; after all, they deliver their
    clever-enough vocals with a likable, gentle voice that's accompanied
    by pretty-enough backing oohs and ahhs and clean instrumentation.
    Still, despite the addition of theremins, saws, keyboards, vibes and
    upright bass (the last two provided by former Coctails Mark Greenberg
    and Barry Phipps, respectively), the Lesser Birds don't exactly stand
    out.  There's no denying that they sound, well... nice.  But that's
    precisely the problem.  There's no uncertainty or worry in the music
    to match that in the lyrics.</p><p>
    
    ""She's Got a Set of Wings,"" for example, really wants to be a sad
    song about an indecisive girl-- the kind that inevitably conjures up
    a mental image of some unfortunate girl you know yourself.  Mark
    Janka sings lines like, ""She used to know the names of all the pigeons
    in Times Square/ Now she's got her own wings/ But they don't take her
    anywhere,"" with a standard sensitive-musician-guy voice and there's
    lots of pretend mellotron to make it sound real moody and stuff.  But
    Janka and his bandmates lack the conviction necessary to pull it off,
    and Phipps' engineering, while competent, lacks the subtlety it takes
    to make such sentiments resonate.  This music sounds too practiced
    to be sincere, and often, Janka's Kindercore-by-way-of-Tweedy vocals
    sound too walked-through to really matter.</p><p>
    
    ""Into Pieces"" may be the most indecisive song here-- but the confusion's
    got nothing to do with unrequited love, a lost hometown or a lack of
    whatever.  Rather, Janka seems uncertain if he's trying to be creepy
    (""If I could cut you into pieces,"" starts one verse; ""If I could stir
    the blood in your veins,"" starts the next), goofy (""And we'd make love
    like all the R&amp;B; singers do/ And we would do it just like R&amp;B; singers
    do""), or wistfully Wilco-esque (""A telescope is my only hope of getting
    closer to you"").  It seems likely the band could pull off any of the
    above with reasonable competency, but instead the three get confused
    and the song wanders without much direction.</p><p>
    
    Were <em>It Isn't the Fall</em> much longer, I might've succeeded in
    mustering up the bile and anger that are necessary ingredients for
    the Trademark Pitchfork Diss.  But at twenty-some minutes, the Lesser
    Birds of Paradise fail to grate any more than they inspire.  They
    don't really strike me as bad or untalented-- they just don't strike
    me at all. <em>It Isn't the Fall</em> is the sort of thing that comes
    and goes every day without getting paid much attention.  It might
    even be likeable, given a temperate day and a benevolent temperament.
    But much like a sunny day in the middle of a frigid Chicago May, I
    know that any such enjoyment will be fleeting.  The Lesser Birds may
    be a quick hint of warmth, but they're hardly the full-on blazing
    summer I'm anxiously awaiting.</p></div>"|4756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4756-it-isnt-the-fall-ep/|5.5|David M. Pecoraro

    The career of this 23-year-old Berliner started by standing in the
    dim corners of some of his hometown's most scenster-y clubs.  From
    those corners, he moved on to the stage to perform Oasis covers.
    Apparently, people found this endearing and, as well as finding time
    to insert some original material in amongst the covers, he became a
    male model.  To the Viva modeling agency, Hecker is the very essence
    of the 'poor sweet shy-boy thing,' and it's evident in his music.</p><p>
<em>Infinite Love Songs</em>, his debut album, is crammed to the gills
    with songs that Hecker would love to die to. This is Hecker's
    expressed intention: to create songs of such beauty that the listener
    will be vaporized into non-existence.  Perhaps it says something
    about my tenacity rather than the relative strength of Hecker's
    skills, but I'm still alive and shuffling after many listens to his
    record.</p><p>
    
    My survival is not entirely indicative of Hecker's failure to promote
    self-extinction in me. In fact, opener ""Polyester"" did make me
    consider throwing myself in front of an oncoming Good Humor van.
    The only reason I haven't topped myself is because I can't think of a
    graceful enough way to send myself off into oblivion having absorbed
    the extreme swooping beauty of ""Polyester"" for one last time.</p><p>
    
    As Hecker recorded <em>Infinite Love Songs</em> at home, it's not
    surprising that his performances are intimate and comfortable.
    His acoustic guitar lines have become as familiar to me as the
    pattern of my bedroom wallpaper, and the way his falsetto reaches
    for sublimity as comfortable as my duvet.  The Beatles-derived piano
    ballad ""The Days Are Long and Filled with Pain"" sends me to my
    teenage years, wrestling with inner conflicts and acne.  Yet the
    winsomely crooned ""Green Night"" falters because Hecker borrowed EMF's
    drum machine.  The resulting rhythm is as predictable as a stopped
    clock, and forces the listener to consider all the more deeply the
    banal ache of his lyrics.  ""Polyester,"" by contrast, redeems itself
    when Hecker repeatedly mumbles in malevolence, ""I'm using gloves.""
    But that slightly imaginative sophistication falls apart during the
    boiled-until-flavorless ""Today,"" a sappy plea for maternal love on
    the day that Hecker plans to kill himself.</p><p>
    
    ""Cold Wind Blowing"" is a return to innocence-- gently plucked guitar
    chords form a soft bed for Hecker to sing about his mental state in
    meteorological metaphors and observes that ""there's no place to
    hide.""  The title track is a feistier affair (and Hecker's most
    pronounced incorporation of the electronic sounds for which the
    Kitty-Yo label is best known). Even so, Hecker never reaches the
    eerie amalgam of classic pop and synthesized sound that James Combs
    did on <em>Please Come Down</em>. Combs' album takes pop hooks and
    falsetto ache to a new imaginative level, whereas Hecker isn't
    willing to commit to more than commonplace longing.</p><p>
    
    What I find frustrating about <em>Infinite Love Songs</em> is that I
    see great potential here-- Hecker has the chops to challenge his
    older, less foppish rivals-- but only after he's progressed beyond
    narcissistic tenth-grade poetry.  To achieve that, he's got to
    experience more and renounce being a model agency's dreamy lost boy,
    self-consciously conspicuous in his corner, practicing his Gallagher
    moves. And my remaining alive after spinning this album so many
    times should give Hecker every reason not to fail me next time.</p></div>"|3795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3795-infinite-love-songs/|5.4|Paul Cooper

    much life that listening to it is like going to a block party, all-day concert
    and a family reunion all at the same time.  <em>Blazing Arrow</em> is the
    major-label debut of underground hip-hop act Blackalicious, and if it sounds
    like they had more money to work with than ever before, at least they spent it
    well.  The layered production, the mess of styles, and the three-ring circus of
    guest stars turn this into a breakthrough record.  But what makes it a
    masterpiece is that Gift of Gab and Chief Xcel can hold it together with the
    directness of their vision of strength and hope: this is unstoppably joyous, a
    complicated album that feels as natural as sunshine on your forehead.</p><p>
    
    Like their full-length debut, <em>Nia</em>, Blackalicious use the full 74 minutes
    of the compact disc, and every minute has something good. But this album is also
    a massive advance on the last one, pushing the limber rhymes and tight beats with
    more musical innovation.  Start with the short funk intro ""Bow and Arrow,"" which
    segues into ""Blazing Arrow,"" featuring a bouncing bassline knocking into a horn
    section and a hazy, dreamy Harry Nilsson sample on the chorus.</p><p>
    
    Xcel and Gab canvas thirty years of funk, soul, hip-hop and modern R&amp;B;, skipping
    from one to the other every song.  There are the nostalgic lyrics and smooth
    sound on ""Make You Feel That Way,"" with its haunting trumpet line; but a couple
    tracks away is ""Chemical Calisthenics,"" a breakneck lyrical workout for Gab
    backed by scattershot beats from Cut Chemist.  <em>Blazing Arrow</em> gets better
    with every listen as you dig into the different styles and rhythms-- from the
    slow glide of ""Brain Washers"" to the strong beats on ""4000 Miles"" and ""Paragraph
    President""-- not to mention the details, like Gab punching in that ""Fade away!""
    on the title track, or the breaking beaker on ""Chemical Calisthenics."" </p><p>
    
    As for the guestlist: it's impressive, not just because of the big names that
    lent a hand, and not just because they sound good, but because some of them have
    never sounded better.  There are plenty of guest rappers-- Lateef the Truth
    Speaker, Chali 2NA, and Lyrics Born, to name a few-- but the other vocalists are
    surprising.  Will Rage Against the Machine's Zack de la Rocha ever have another
    chance to shout on a record this mature?  And Gil Scott-Heron's basso profundo
    firms up ""First in Flight""-- he didn't even sound that good back when he sounded
    that good.  Fellow SoleSides alumnus DJ Shadow slips in a between-tracks
    interlude, and Saul Williams gets a showcase for his gnarled, elaborate verses
    in ""Release.""  And ?uestlove of the Roots co-wrote and plays drums on one of the
    album's standouts, the missed-opportunities rumination of ""Nowhere Fast.""</p><p>
<em>Blazing Arrow</em> has moments of slick R&amp;B;, not least because of the
    MCA-roster female vocalists who help slow things down: Jaguar Wright's randy,
    sassy guest spot on ""Aural Pleasure,"" Keke Wyatt on ""It's Going Down,"" or
    Tracey Moore's smooth-as-silk chorus on ""Nowhere Fast.""  Xcel fills out the
    sound with live instruments, including horns on several songs.  Dig the funky
    keyboards and cello low in the mix on ""Nowhere Fast"" as Gab runs through a list
    of what he'll accomplish ""tomorrow,"" while the music sends him drifting away.</p><p>
    
    Gab has plenty of fast rhymes, but is more impressive for the clarity of his
    message.  There's a humility to his frontman stance that makes this album about
    everything but himself.  He and Xcel have the stage, and all they want to do is
    share it.  It's as if the scope of this album-- the stylistic diversity, the
    guest artists, the sincere, ecstatic rhymes-- doesn't come from ambition or
    creativity for its own sake, but out of a need to include everyone they know
    and everything they see around them.  Not since <i>Car Wash</i> has there been
    such a celebration of diversity and hot fun in the summertime.  And unlike that
    otherwise classic film, <i>Blazing Arrow</i> doesn't have the Pointer Sisters
    to drag it down.</p></div>"|787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/787-blazing-arrow/|9.3|Chris Dahlen

    and Two Live Jews?  Nothing, actually, but if you moved a few consonants around,
    the former, a group of gender benders, would be identical with the latter, a
    group of genre blenders.  Gender benders and genre blenders-- each so enigmatic,
    each so alluring.  Or depending on the execution, instantly familiar and utterly
    repulsive. Clearly, this business of combining in one package that which has
    formerly remained distinct is awfully tricky. So tricky that the
    hardcore/pop-punk quartet Thrice has yet to figure it out.</p><p>
    
    Have you ever looked at RuPaul and thought, ""What the fuck?""  Some things just
    aren't meant to be-- six-foot-seven-inch men and high heels, for example.  Listen
    to the opening track of <em>The Illusion of Safety</em>, ""Kill Me Quickly,"" and
    you'll feel the same.  It begins powerfully, with a burst of thick, crunchy metal
    chords and singer Dustin Kensrue's authentic hardcore growl.  Then, with little
    more than 30 seconds invested, you get hardcore turned on its skull, in the form
    of hackneyed emo-verse. Weird, sure, but it gets weirder: the song then transitions
    back into its metal vibe, except with lyrical emo entrails: ""Let's fall asleep
    together/ Hold me darling 'cause I'm scared/ And I can't do this alone.""  Huh?</p><p>
    
    After the opener, Thrice retreats from the utterly sugary to the moderately sweet,
    blending metal with run-of-the-mill pop/punk. Imagine Blink-182 backed by the
    Fucking Champs, and you're approaching the mind warp Thrice hurls upon you. It's
    not seamless by a long shot-- the elements here are plainly distinct and separable,
    and unfortunately for the band, a little too hard to reconcile with one another.
    Like ""In Years to Come,"" which opens with an admittedly badass speed-metal riff.
    I ask you this: how can that ever-- and I mean in <i>any</i> conceivable world--
    work in concert with lyrics like, ""It's a different kind of love?""  Call me
    traditional, but I'm just not feeling it.</p><p>
    
    Despite their stylistic gumbo (and maybe you're picking up on this), Thrice
    deserves some props.  In terms of their hardcore/metal riffing capabilities,
    Thrice has the skills to get the job done.  The guitar overload on ""In Years to
    Come,"" for example, is grade-A stuff, as is just about all of ""To Awake and
    Avenge the Dead.""  This, however, is like saying Wes Borland is a great guitarist;
    no matter how much you try to fiddle with your stereo EQ, you're always going to
    have to deal with Durst.  In this case, Thrice's Durst is its incongruous lyrical
    and melodic direction.  As proof, here's another good one, from ""Deadbolt"": ""And
    you, my true love... You call from the hilltop, you call through the streets."" </p><p>
    
    Despite all of the vitriolic criticism contained herein, if you think you can
    ignore the singer, you might want to buy this album anyway.  The band adds a
    conspicuous pledge to devote a portion of its proceeds to charity, a worthy
    organization in South Central Los Angeles called ""A Place Called Home""
    (benefiting at-risk youth). Then again, it might be more economical to simply
    skip the album purchase and give straight to the charity.  If you write them,
    tell them, ""I don't know why I'm here/ Guess I'm afraid to be alone"" (from ""See
    You in the Shallows""). Or don't, and make the wise metal-move of keeping your
    pansy-ass emotions to yourself.</p><p>
    
    So there you have Thrice, heavy on instrumental ability, heavy on philanthropy,
    but featherweights in the songwriting department. Unique?  I'll give them that,

Most people would have you believe that he's the
    genre's undisputed <em>pater familias</em> and there would be no such thing as
    bluegrass without him.  Well, that's true too, but he's also responsible for
    its lack of vitality as an art form, its stagnation, and its relegation to the
    museum to gather dust.</p><p>
    
    He did this by defining it too specifically, by stating (both verbally and
    implicitly through the wild success of his music) exactly what bluegrass
    <em>is</em>.  As a result, he hermetically sealed it, and cut it off from the
    influence of other kinds of music, which is what keeps a musical style alive
    and vibrant.  It's ironic, considering the alchemy Monroe dabbled in to create
    bluegrass in the first place-- mixing together hillbilly, old-time string band
    music, western swing, classic folk balladry, jazz, etc.  Nevertheless, it's
    ultimately his fault that there hasn't been much significant development in
    bluegrass since he cut his classic sides with Columbia in the mid-to-late 40s
    with the Bluegrass Boys.</p><p>
    
    No musical genre is more haunted by its past than bluegrass-- not even reggae.
    Monroe's specter looms so heavily over the practitioners that most seem
    unwilling-- or more likely unable-- to push the form forward.  The critic
    Harold Bloom called it the anxiety of influence, and in the case of bluegrass
    it's stultifying.  Sure, there are stylistic shadings and sub-genre
    stratification if you really get into it, but basically it all comes down to
    Monroe.  He embodies the form.  It's similar to Andre Breton and his tyrannical
    control over the Surrealists (i.e., defining the terms, determining who was a
    surrealist and who wasn't), only in the case of bluegrass, Monroe's right to
    final say was accepted without much fuss.</p><p>
    
    I've been to my share of bluegrass festivals, and while I appreciate the
    tradition and the musicianship bluegrass musicians almost invariably possess,
    it's hard not to feel like you're at a funeral when you're at these things,
    and not just because many of the pickers and fans are septuagenarians.  You
    almost wish someone would do something tacky and desperate, like pull out a
    drum machine or plug in a theremin just to stir things up.</p><p>
    
    Jim and Jennie and the Pinetops are raging against the dying of the light while
    at the same time dragging the carcass around with them. And I'm not sure how
    worthwhile the whole exercise is. The Philadelphian neo-bluegrass outfit,
    probably best known to indie rock fans for appearing on Songs: Ohia's <em>Didn't
    It Rain</em>, have a good outing on their new record <em>One More in the Cabin</em>.
    Yet, while pleasant enough, it surely isn't anything that's going to give
    bluegrass that long-overdue kick in the pants.  But maybe these days that's all
    you can rightly ask of a bluegrass album-- that it be enjoyable, a good
    collection of songs to listen to on Sunday morning.</p><p>
<em>One More in the Cabin</em> sticks to the tried-and-true components of canonical,
    classically defined bluegrass: the high lonesome sound, the close harmonies (a
    nice touch given the male and female vocalists here), the standard five-piece
    guitar/bass/banjo/mandolin/fiddle instrumentation, the frenetic breakdowns
    followed by the rollicking ballad, and, for the most part, the lyrical subject
    matter (i.e., death, the weather, apple trees, etc.).  In fact, this last item
    might reveal the most outstanding thing about the Pinetops: listening to the
    album before reading the liner notes, I was sure I'd heard some of these songs
    before. But they're all originals. One song in particular, ""Mourning Dove,"" had
    me convinced the liner notes must be wrong-- I was certain it was an old timey
    standard. But, no. It's just a good solid song, that, by all rights should be a
    standard someday.  Isn't it a little sad, though, when the measure of success
    within a style of music isn't originality but how close the music comes to the
    accepted standard?</p><p>
    
    Of course, the demographic who made the soundtrack to the movie <em>O Brother,
    Where Art Thou?</em> a fluke hit-- the NPR/Borders crowd-- will eat this up.
    That's not a putdown exactly, it's just a marketing tip.  And there sure as
    hell are worse things they could be sippin' lattes to (Sting).  But ultimately,
    <em>One More in the Cabin</em> is yet another tombstone-- a well-crafted one, yes,
    but a signal of doom all the same, an indicator of the sad, ironic fate of the
    music whose founder was so damn good his hegemony became oppressive.</p></div>"|4254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4254-one-more-in-the-cabin/|6.4|Jason Nickey

    as I do in the fidelity of my overseas liaison, Papillon Soo Soo. That's not to
    say that Pitchfork's mandatory inclusion of a numerical rating with its reviews
    isn't justifiable. One glance at the site's readership will reveal that all
    advertisements and promotional gimmicks for which our existence is a vehicle
    are geared towards your prototypical inner-city collegiate male-- children of
    the instant-gratification generation who want as little as possible to do with
    the kind of painfully long literary passages they encounter on a daily basis.
    For those with an aversion to the lengthy texts and editorial fodder which act
    as a smokescreen for our more corporate endeavors, we provide a randomly selected
    numerical approximation of an album's greatness by which your preconceptions of
    music are to be realigned accordingly.</p><p>
    
    The preceding example of depurated cynicism has more purpose than simply
    illustrating the effects of insomnia on your humble narrator's keyboarding.
    In reviewing Azure Ray's latest collection of unexcitable meditations on lost
    love, <em>Burn and Shiver</em>, my chosen rating of 6.8 will signify to many that
    there has been a drop in quality since group's 2001 eponymous debut for Warm
    Records, an album which Pitchfork deemed a 7.0.  But nothing could be further
    from the truth, as <em>Burn and Shiver</em> finds Bright Eyes/Japancakes/Moby
    collaborators Orenda Fink and Maria Taylor improving upon nearly every aspect
    of their essential formula.</p><p>
    
    While Azure Ray's debut boasted one or two truly moving songs-- most notably,
    the pensive ballad ""Displaced""-- it suffered from a horrible case of homogeny,
    as many tracks seemed mere variations on the group's favored structural idiom:
    the mid-tempo acoustic waltz. The overbearing sense of sameness to be found
    throughout didn't lend the disc to repeated, discriminating listens.</p><p>
<em>Burn and Shiver</em> remedies many of the group's past transgressions, as our
    favorite Eric Bachmann understudies have recently discovered the joy of
    incorporating percussive elements and-- in the instance of the excellent ""New
    Year""-- small flirtations with IDM into their sonic spectrum.  No, the girls
    still haven't allowed <em>Songs from a Room</em> to leave their turntable, but
    on tracks such as ""How You Remember"" and the stellar ""Raining in Athens,"" they
    come closer than ever to wielding an emotional potency like master Cohen's.</p><p>
    
    Yet, in spite of the progress to be found on <em>Burn and Shiver</em>, the album
    brims with brilliance unrealized, as many songs still refuse to fulfill the
    moments they seem fully capable of.  This could be attributed to the fact that
    the girls have yet to author a lyrical passage worthy of their absolutely
    gorgeous vocals, often devolving into forcefully evocative lines that wax
    nostalgic of adolescent summers long past, et al.  Were the arrangements more
    dynamic, such criticisms would be forgiveable, but Fink and Taylor's compositions
    often disengage the listener after a few minutes, generally resulting in
    unintentional drones.</p><p>
    
    It's refreshing to hear two clearly talented artists beginning to inch out of
    the shadow of their influences, however long it may be. Though I'm not expecting
    their magnum opus any time soon, a few more albums of similar consistency will
    yield enough individual moments to comprise a satisfying body of work.  Maybe
    by that time, Azure Ray will have come into their own.</p></div>"|399.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/399-burn-and-shiver/|6.8|Kevin Adickes

    but now she's made matters worse by turning Presbyterian. The only reason I still
    go see her is to try to purge my lingering shame over needing to buy every
    compilation with more than thirty seconds of Will Oldham on it. So, hooray,
    now I've got something called <em>All Tomorrow's Parties 2.0</em> to put beside
    the <em>Dutch Harbor</em> soundtrack, the <em>Quelque Chose D'Organique</em>
    soundtrack, that Tweaker thing, that last <em>All Tomorrow's Parties</em> (or
    which Oldham helped Papa M cover Cat Stevens), that Briana Corrigan thing,
    <em>Louisville Sonic Imprint Volume 1</em>, Boxhead Ensemble's <em>The Last Place
    to Go</em>, that John Denver tribute, the Johnny Cash duet, the Anomoanon duets,
    <em>Hey Drag City</em>, <em>The Drag City Hour</em>, <em>At Home with the Groovebox</em>,
    <em>Succour</em>, <em>Sounds of the Geographically Challenged</em>, <em>Sourmash</em>,
    <em>Macro Dub Infection Volume 2</em>, <em>Love Is My Only Crime</em>, <em>Louisville
    Sluggers Vol. 3</em>, and that nervous circle-jerk with Appendix Out and Songs:
    Ohia on the My Morning Jacket split!  Please, born-again Mistress Filthcobra,
    stand on the backs of my knees, spit on me and call me your diapersnake, ther
    please carve the word 'pathetic' into the meat of my lower back. This indie rock
    completist thing requires too much legwork.  I may as well be buying lottery
    tickets.</p><p>
    
    If you checked your hair in the mirror five times today, then you probably
    already know what All Tomorrow's Parties is: it's the series of well-intentioned
    live music marathons devised by fey-wafers Belle and Sebastian to circumvent the
    sponsor-pimping horrors and generally stank vibes of their predecessors.  ATP is
    what the rich kids were planning for on that listserv you haunt.  Poor people
    can, however, save up and purchase this accompanying CD.  Unfortunately, wher
    you press play, your speakers won't emit communal principles, so you'll have to
    settle for toe-tapping rarities by key participants.</p><p>
    
    This disc is from the third festival, called <em>v2.0</em> and set in the UK,
    which is not a big deal like the U.S. edition (that's ATP 1.1 for those keeping
    putt-putt scorecards) since the UK has awesome concerts all the time (sniff,
    pout). The UK, see, is a magical place where Thom Yorke sells you your morning
    paper, where pedestrians are equidistant like the cover of <em>Abbey Road</em>,
    and the streets are paved with PJ Harvey's discarded lingerie.  The ATP discs
    have been packaged all sleek and antiseptic, like software, and each has had a
    curator from indie rock's more pretentious upper-tier (the first two were
    curated by Tortoise and Sonic Youth, this one's by Shellac).  Lordy, if the
    punks are curating, then a human-beatbox fugue can't be far behind.</p><p>
    
    Okay, so the Will Oldham song is a great one that reteams him with a couple
    Anomoanon guys to pull off a giddy pirate-jig cover of one of the Kate Wolf
    tunes he did on his faultline-coast tour with those eco-strummers in Rainywood.
    When not dreamily mid-ooohh, he sounds like the bridge troll in rehab, trying
    to explain the appeal of the gruff goats.  If Oldham's song is the jauntiest,
    then Nina Nastasia's is the most conventional.  But that doesn't mean it's not
    plenty pretty, blending elements of the best dark-folk chanteuses past, present,
    and probably future. The Fall's ""Two Librans"" is a standout, as they continue to
    sound like the Richard Pryor-designed computer from <em>Superman III</em> is
    forcing them to compose mutated dance-rock against their will.  Some Chicago
    sugardaddy had better break ground on an Indie Hall of Fame, and quick, before
    these guys become Tolstoys that everybody namedrops but nobody experiences.</p><p>
    
    Shellac's ""Watch Song"" is a slab of explosive-drum, post-human, death-wiener
    blues, but it gets upstaged by a mighty, mighty 8\xBD minute offering from Shipping
    News that's more confident and epic than their recent records.  That Arcwelder's
    ""Do Something Right"" sounds quaint and retro is testament to this comp's
    fundamental progressiveness.  The imposing hit from High Dependency Unit and a
    bouncy ""Trem Two"" from Mission of Burma will have to share the Daytime Emmy for
    Best Effects Pedals-- in fact, the drums, chanting, and bassline laid down by
    them Missionaries will take you back to when it all got called 'college rock.'
    Had something to do with wanting to go to college, I reckon.</p><p>
    
    What showcase of contemporary hip sounds would be complete without some of those
    amazing, but bloated, hard-to-describe instrumental bands?  The strings of
    Threnody Ensemble's seven-minute ""Groups"" are seductive, lilting along chipperly
    only to get tense and foreboding on a dime. The Godspeeders in Do Make Say Think
    live up to their sound, if not to all those idealist present-tense verbs.  Though
    it's not without its gorgeousness, even the non-rare album track ""Classic
    Noodlanding"" seems to be admitting that it's par.  The band should move forward
    or team up with one of those old-school rap groups like EPMD, who were proud to
    promise from album to album that ain't a damn thing changed. Rachel's contributior
    has a title so amateur-poetic I won't type it, but the song is an affecting
    piano-and-drum-driven buildup from 1998.</p><p>
    
    Nobody here tosses off a dried turd-- much of this disc is as beautiful or as
    beautifully ugly as the current scene gets, although one occasionally feels a
    chill from spending so much time in Krautrock's long apoplectic shadow.  The
    power-pomp of <em>ATP v2.0</em> is worth the investment, even if you just use it
    to soundtrack a cigarette-and-antiperspirant run.  Besides, you have a free spot
    on your Various Artists shelf beside <em>Colonel Jeffrey Pumperknickel</em> since
    you sold back <em>Schoolhouse Rocks</em>.</p></div>"|1842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1842-all-tomorrows-parties-v20/|7.9|William Bowers

Kind of uninspired.  Supernatural hooks from beyond the grave.  All sorts
    of descriptors spring to mind when I think about Phantom Planet's second album,
    <em>The Guest</em>.  But honestly, how many of you actually care what this record
    sounds like?  Let's just lay all our cards on the table.  With a quick show of
    hands, who among you is only interested in Phantom Planet because that kid from
    <em>Rushmore</em> is the drummer?  Come on, 'fess up.  There was a time when I,
    too, couldn't have cared less about them if I wasn't such a fan of Wes Anderson's
    films.</p><p>
    
    At first glance, Phantom Planet seemingly has 'gimmick' built into its DNA--
    see, frontman Alex Greenwald's also got an acting career.  And just <i>look</i>
    at them!  The last time I saw five guys doing so much self-conscious posing was
    in <i>Zoolander</i>.  Plus, they've got three guitars.  Now that's anarchy!</p><p>
    
    But the thing is, somewhere between all the vamping and forced attempts at being
    hip and irreverent, they found the time to write and record a fine record.  <em>The
    Guest</em> is practically the definition of pop-- there's enough bubblegum and
    sticky-sweet lyrics in these twelve tracks to finance a Hubba Bubba comeback.
    Some of the songwriting here is unbelievably catchy, and bordering on brilliantly
    so.  Sure, it ain't too complicated, but this sort of music rarely is (it's not
    like these guys are Mathletes or anything).  And the unstoppable production duo
    Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake work wonders for the album, too, keeping the
    sounds crystal clear and light as a feather.</p><p>
    
    Unlike most bands that claim their music is reminiscent of 60s pop, Phantom Planet
    actually make good on their promise, while also capably wrapping the sound
    around a variety of obvious influences from Radiohead (""Turn Smile Shift Repeat"")
    to Elvis Costello (""Nobody's Fault"" and ""One Ray of Sunlight"").  Of course, the
    same retro charm that effortlessly carries the more upbeat numbers fails to
    translate as well to the more subdued cuts, and while the vocals are almost
    uniformly enjoyable, hearing Greenwald strain his pipes on a couple of these
    tunes gets a little tiresome.</p><p>
    
    Still, <em>The Guest</em> is well executed and enjoyable, and fares much better
    than a lot of by-the-numbers pop/rock.  It might be a little empty-headed for
    some people's tastes, but hey, not mine.  All they need to do now is get Dogstar
    to open their tour.  Then for the encore, Jason Schwartzman and Keanu Reeves
    could come out and sing some sort of duet-- like a Wyld Stallyns medley!  Now
    that I'd pay good money to see.</p></div>"|6257.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6257-the-guest/|7.3|Eric Carr

    or the more of it, the better. For example, something about the idea of a
    100-plex is interesting both on the structural tip and logistically.  If they're
    playing 100 movies (realistically 50-- at least ten theaters would have to be
    reserved for <em>Star Wars</em>, et. al.), there might be one or two that
    <em>don't</em> feature helicopters, corsets, or a soundtrack by Blink-182.
    That's the double-edged sword of quantity thinking: with so much selection,
    we expect to find a gem hidden in all the mass. Conversely, we've gotten so
    used to having so much space that people seem incapable of turning out the
    good stuff without a whole helluva lot of clutter.</p><p>
<em>Super/System</em>, the third album (and first for Dischord) from D.C. trio El
    Guapo,  contains-- count 'em-- eighteen tracks in 42 minutes.  This is ar
    impressive feat for an avant-garde band whose appetite for sonic weirdness,
    jazz fusion, and various and sundry electronic bells and whistles might have
    you anticipating an extended horn jam session, ambient noise, and general
    rhythmic fucking around.  And you wouldn't be wrong.  There's some of all of
    that: the six-minute ""Being Boulevard"" includes all of the above, plus some
    appropriately Mark E. Smith-influenced yelling about fast lanes and bite-size
    snacks.  There's something sort of appealing about this mix, though the ambient
    drone that makes up the latter half of the song is about 3\xBD minutes too long,
    and I'm curious to see how exactly they would pull this off live.</p><p>
    
    But ""Being Boulevard"" is just the tip of the iceberg. <em>Super/System</em>
    contains so many sounds, and so many styles of music (sometimes within the same
    song, or in the same bar of the same song) that you might suffer under the
    temporary delusion that you're not listening to a cohesive album at all, but
    a quirky sound effects CD. There's just so much here-- it's the Old Country
    Buffet approach to songwriting.</p><p>
    
    As previously noted, this approach guarantees them some moments of pure
    greatness; the problem is that they're not necessarily in any individual
    song.  So here, I'll give you a short list of the most solid assets El Guapo
    has going for them: the droning harmonies over the driving, near-military
    drums on ""My Bird Sings,"" the icy, clever <em>TNT</em>-era Tortoise rhythms or
    ""Disappointment Spelled With A V.,"" and even the flurry of free-jazz horns that
    pop up sporadically are great the first or second time around.</p><p>
    
    Signing to Dischord is kind of a big step for El Guapo; it may earn them a whole
    new variety of fans. In that light, <em>Super/System</em> may be seen as sort of a
    crossover album.  There are moments here that are accessible-- ""Buildables"" is
    pretty catchy and easygoing, even though it does sound sort of like simplified
    Autechre with vocals.  But El Guapo doesn't let you get too comfortable with any
    one genre or style. Things change so rapidly (and songs end so quickly) that
    <em>Super/System</em> may actually be less accessible than their previous work.</p><p>
    
    When you start to incorporate experimental techniques into your music, a kind of
    underlying master plan is not a bad idea. Like, your audience, ideally, shouldn't
    get the impression that you threw that arrhythmic cacophonous mix of beeps and
    buzzes and bleats called ""Faith Based Music"" onto the album after an offhand
    in-studio conversation beginning with the lines, ""Hey guys, you know what would
    be really cool...?""  It's tedious.</p><p>
<em>Super/System</em> sounds like the best Christmas present ever for a burgeoning
    DJ.  It's all there-- the sudden bursts of vocals, of melody, of interesting
    beats, of fun instrumental blips-- a seemingly inexhaustible resource!  Turning
    100 varieties of racket out on one 42 minute CD may earn accolades in some
    circles.  As for me, I'm too overwhelmed to wade through all the clamor looking
    for the moments of genius.</p></div>"|11728.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11728-supersystem/|5.8|Alison Fields

    without the usual vitriolic Pitchfork anti-Vagrant spiel, I underwent a vigorous
    regimen of holistic treatments. Employing acupuncture, aromatherapy, yoga, and
    reiki sessions, I attuned my brain to its optimal meditative state. Most
    importantly, I received twice-daily 'full body massages' from Maryann's
    Rub-N-Tug on 14th street, via the considerable expertise of the highly talented
    'Vanessa' (tell 'em Rob sent you!).</p><p>
    
    This meticulous and tax-deductible procedure was necessary preparation for
    tackling <em>Para Toda Vida</em>, in order to organize every last ounce of
    journalistic integrity to make a fair assessment of the album's quality.  For
    you see, the New Amsterdams is the solo acoustic project of one Matthew Pryor,
    singer/guitarist for buzz-bin pop/punk cutie pies the Get Up Kids.  And while
    the Kids have a Pitchfork credibility rating somewhere between Bobby McFerrin
    and Pablo Cruise, their albums (and spinoffs like this one) are consistent
    high-charters with the underclassmen crowd.  So, as a service to our younger
    readers, it is my mission to judge the album without bias and on its own terms
    as Pryor's expedition into singer/songwriterly territory.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, on that scale, <em>Para Toda Vida</em> still isn't-- how you
    say?  Ah, yes-- good.  Sure, the brief proceedings succeed at achieving a
    certain level of low-key intimacy, like a peek inside Pryor's bedroom while
    he holds a personal strumming session (not like that, perv).  But while the
    concept strives to be third-wave emo's answer to Springsteen's <em>Nebraska</em>
    or Neil Young's <em>Harvest</em>, Pryor copies the methods while missing the point
    of the folkie approach, expecting poignancy and emotional depth to spontaneously
    result from stripped-down instrumentation.</p><p>
    
    The very structure of the songs themselves exhibit this mistaken attitude, often
    coming off as typical Get Up Kids fare played during a power outage, rather than
    compositions written with acoustic instrumentation in mind.  Pryor's day job
    leaves him with little more than two strumming patterns in his arsenal-- the
    fast strumming and slow finger-picked riffs of an intermediate-level guitar
    student. Also unmodified is Pryor's standard-issue throaty/nasal pop/punk
    voice, the uniform peppiness of which instantly strips away any variation in
    mood or emotional tone.</p><p>
    
    Nor do Pryor's lyrics survive the extra scrutiny a solo setting casts upon them:
    while the words manage to avoid the broken-hearted weblog suffering of colleagues
    Dashboard Confessional, neither do they say, well, much of anything at all.
    Struggling to paint stirring word images of life's little complexites, songs end
    up instead with paper-thin morals (""Escape is the only way out"") and the kind of
    condescending lonely-waitress empathy MOR staples Train specialize in.  It's
    telling that the most compelling lyric of the entire album-- ""It's possible the
    piano may be drinking/ But it's not me""-- is an uncredited swipe from an artist
    Pryor can be reasonably sure his base audience has never heard, Tom Waits.</p><p>
    
    It may sound like I haven't succeeded in washing my ears of the fact that
    <em>Para Toda Vida</em> was made, in reality, by a Get Up Kid, but even in a
    blind taste test it'd be pretty obvious that it's the half-baked meanderings
    of a pop-punkster minus the drummer and Marshall stack.  To tell the truth,
    appraising the record with Vagrant prejudice intact allows me to make the
    biggest compliment possible-- that the album isn't any worse than I expected
    it to be.  But whether my chosen lens is objective, subjective, or just flat
    out pissy, there's no getting around the fact that <em>Para Toda Vida</em> is
    still ten songs destined for incidental music on the WB's primetime lineup.</p></div>"|5761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5761-para-toda-vida/|3.3|Rob Mitchum

    cultural institutions of our key demographic: Weezer and <em>Star Wars</em>.  Check
    it out: Weezer's self-titled return from hibernation (colloquially known as
    <i>The Green Album</i>) was <em>The Phantom Menace</em> of indie rock.  Both sci-fi
    epic and alt-rock record were long-awaited events that had even the most jaded
    hipster hopping around like a small child with a full bladder.  However, reactions
    to <em>Star Wars: Episode One</em> and <em>Weezer: Episode Three</em> were predominantly
    (and in some cases, absurdly) negative, despite small pockets of supporters slinging
    the old ""just turn your brain off and have fun"" argument.</p><p>
    
    To be fair, the analogy isn't completely fail-safe.  After all, <em>The Phantom
    Menace</em> didn't break the <em>Star Wars</em> hiatus with a skimpy 28 minutes of
    new material, and <i>The Green Album</i> didn't have some of the worst acting--
    human or computerized-- in the history of film.   Furthermore, by my standards,
    Weezer's second eponymous release was nowhere near the memory-raping experience
    <em>Episode I</em> entailed, nor was it as terrible as judged by this site and
    elsewhere.  Freed from the skyscraper-high expectations surrounding its release,
    <i>The Green Album</i> on return visits has shown to carry a fair amount of damn
    fine singalong tunes, while rewatching <em>The Phantom Menace</em> induces more
    wincing than a Jackie Chan blooper reel.</p><p>
    
    Now, convenient for my journalistic maneuvering, both franchises have produced
    their next efforts to get in your wallet-- <em>Attack of the Clones</em> and
    <em>Maladroit</em>.  Regardless of what you might have thought about <em>The
    Phantom Menace</em> or <i>The Green Album</i>, it's undeniable that the rollouts
    of their respective followups are not garnering the same kind of delirious
    Second Coming-level hype.  Not surprisingly, the response to <em>Attack of the
    Clones</em> has fallen along more traditional critics-vs.-the-public lines, with
    film writers generally turning up their nose at the flick's wooden dialog while
    normal people celebrate the picture as quality escapism.  <em>Maladroit</em>, by
    continuing in the vein of <i>The Green Album</i>, promises a similar division of
    opinion, meaning a responsible critic (like myself) should probably submit it to
    the Mindless Fun Litmus Test.</p><p>
    
    The MFLT is appropriate because, yeah, <em>Maladroit</em> is definitely not a
    return to the sound of the band's mid-90s artistic peak.  But to give them the
    benefit of the doubt, it's pretty apparent what the Weez are shooting for with
    the new record-- a further distillation of their power-pop specialties into
    short, catchy, big-riff-centered nuggets.  Many writers will probably try to
    lump this incarnation of the band in with Andrew W.K. and the White Stripes for
    a 'Return of the Rawk!' style feature, but what's truly apparent is Weezer's
    now-complete focus upon the concert experience rather than studio twiddling.
    The flying-V guitars and large light-up =W= of their stage act no longer carry
    the wink that they used to, and these songs are tailored specifically to provoke
    mosh pits and elicit rampant flashing of devil-horns. </p><p>
    
    With <em>Maladroit</em>, Weezer has finally given the full punt to the nerd-rock
    label they sorta invented and always shunned, settling instead for being our
    generation's version of Cheap Trick.  Rockford, Illinois' finest is just one of
    the classic guitar-worship pop bands invoked by the majority of the songs here,
    many of which seem like slight musical and thematic variations upon ""I Want You
    to Want Me,"" and all of which make room for a fingers-flying solo.  Things are
    harder-edged musically than the sunny <i>Green Album</i> tunes, with guitarists
    Rivers Cuomo and Brian Bell laying on as much distortion as possible over the
    crunchy riffs that hold up ""American Gigolo"" and ""Take Control"" and, well, pretty
    much the entire affair.  But lyrically, things are still anchored in your usual
    white-man pleading-voice girl courtship, as song titles like ""Love Explosion,""
    ""Possibilities,"" and ""Slave"" clearly indicate.</p><p>
    
    When this full-bodied attitude accompanies typically gooey Cuomo melodies, it
    makes for a handful of some of the best in-car rockout material of recent years.
    ""Keep Fishin'"" has boisterous call-and-response vocals and at least three
    different sections catchy enough to serve as choruses, while ""Fall Together""
    is grunge-pop worthy of the late St. Kurt himself.  Many songs on <em>Maladroit</em>
    come off as near-cover version love letters to Cuomo's rock heroes, most
    noticeably when ""December"" grafts a replica of the Who's ""Love Reign O'er Me""
    to a souped-up 50s prom theme arrangement.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, the Kiss emulation and guitar-god posturing is a pretty thin
    disguise for a band that's pretty obviously a mere shadow of its former self.
    Weezer's first two albums were almost unanimously loved, hyper-influential,
    near-masterpiece collections of quirky, personal, addictive power-pop.  Stripping
    down to the basics is one thing, but removing almost every element and
    characteristic that separated the band from the other million quartets-with-guitars
    is a sad, sad sight to see.  There's a thin line between homage and unoriginality,
    and it's hard not to notice that, in their effort to emulate their guitar-rock
    heroes, Weezer has to some extent become a fairly straightforward, above-average
    bar band.</p><p>
    
    Don't come looking for any of the eccentric flourishes of ""Undone"" or ""El
    Scorcho,"" as <em>Maladroit</em> is predominantly a one-note, homogenous affair.
    Deviations from the hard-rock mean are whiffs: ""Death and Destruction"" slows
    things down for some nazel-gaving, but can't come close to the emotional weight
    of a ""Say It Ain't So,"" for example.  ""Burndt Jamb"" revisits the tropical flair
    of ""Island in the Sun""-- and is only a keyboard and a Laetitia away from being
    Stereolab-- but can't resist falling back on steel-toed overdrive theatrics in
    the middle.  Meanwhile, Cuomo continues to move away from the intensely specific
    lyrical content of earlier work (I've always wondered if that half-Japanese
    cellist got a cut of <em>Pinkerton</em>'s profits), preferring instead to drop
    angstful Everyman phrases like, ""Get yourself a wife/ Get yourself a job/ You're
    living a dream/ Don't you be a slob.""</p><p>
    
    Right, so now's the part where I'm accused of underestimating <em>Maladroit</em>'s
    youthful relevancy, missing the possibility that this album might mean as much
    to today's disenfranchised high school crowd as <i>The Blue Album</i> or
    <em>Pinkerton</em> meant to me in more innocent times.  Maybe so, but it should
    be noted that I was a late-blooming Weezer fan, having written them off back in
    their first heyday and only cultivating a true appreciation for them over the
    last couple years.  Given that fact, I have no qualms about taking a stand and
    pegging <em>Maladroit</em> as the slightest effort yet from the Weez, marking a
    continuation of their distressing downward trajectory and a perpetuation of
    their post-comeback complacence.  It may have a handful of premium-grade
    headbangers, but in the mindless fun department, it sure ain't Yoda battling
    Christopher Lee.</p></div>"|8613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8613-maladroit/|5.4|Rob Mitchum

Get up on that barstool and talk some noise     about Pete Jesperson.  You still owe me a rum-and-coke for ""World Class Fad"".</p>
<p>Such is how a conversation between myself and olde Paul Westerberg might've     gone had we hooked up for a drink at the Turf Club a couple of months ago for     an interview I just dreamt up to make this transition smoother.  Yeah, I could     be like the rest of you cynical half-breeds and feign disinterest, write this     weathered codger off and tell you to save yourself the worry and pick up a     <i>Sorry Ma</i> reissue.  After all, I've got the practice, having spent the     last ten years bored to tears by Westerberg's post-Replacements solo schlock.     <i>14 Songs</i> and <i>Eventually</i> have long since left my memory banks,     forgettable like the phrase ""adult contemporary singer/songwriter.""  Yet,     after getting the boot from two major labels in the past four years, Westy's     back on the minor circuit with a sense of confidence so renewed it produced     two full-length records.</p>
<p>But what shocks even more than his sudden resurgence in popularity is the fact     that these albums mark the first time since about 1987 that Westerberg's released     anything worth more than a 5.0.  And while I'm on a roll here, I'll go ahead and     be controversial: <i>Stereo</i> and <i>Mono</i> are the best work Paul's done ir     like fifteen years.  And yeah, I'm just as surprised as the rest of you skeptics.</p>
<p><i>Stereo</i>'s a collection of low-key, country-tinged acoustic ballads, sad     love songs, and bluesy rock beaters that were reputedly self-recorded in the     basement of Westerberg's house over the course of two years. The amateurish     production announces its presence with abruptly ending songs and occasional,     unintentional background racket.  Westerberg plays all the instruments,     occasionally flubs lyrics, and gets defensive in the liner notes: ""Unprofessional?     Perhaps.  Real?  Unquestionably.""  Cocky?  Yep.  But the man's got a right.     This here's the <i>inventor</i> of cock, the guy who shared a town with the     already well-established Hüsker Dü and openly mocked them in a song on his     band's <i>debut album!</i></p>
<p>That cockiness fights its way onto both <i>Stereo</i> and <i>Mono</i>, and     solely on the basis of the man rediscovering his testicles, these records are     worth a listen.  But there's more: reverting to his trademark graveled vocals     and veering off the path of predictability by dropping some genuinely <i>loud</i> material along the way, Westerberg's conviction is nearly as strong now as it     was in his prime.  And, spared the studio polish and complex arrangements of the     rest of his solo catalog, these songs are simply solid-- proving that when he's     inspired, he can still bring home the magic.  Unquestionably.</p>
<p>The disc opens with ""Baby Learns to Crawl,"" with its spacious guitar and muted     accordion effects fading into ""Dirt to Mud,"" a plaintive, acoustic Dylan-esque     paean to regret.  The excellent, waltz-timed ""Got You Down"" even recalls the     sparse intimacy of <i>Nebraska</i>-era Springsteen.  For an album conceived and     recorded with a modicum of slick production toys, it does a great job manipulating     atmosphere from song to song.  Take the downtempo blues-pop of ""No Place for     You,"" which, for its spatial expanse, is remarkably intimate (likewise the     lo-fi rock of ""Unlisted Track"").  Makes one wonder about the acoustics of     Westerberg's basement.</p>
<p>Included with the original pressings of <i>Stereo</i> comes <i>Mono</i> (released under that cheeseball moniker Grandpaboy), and seen as a double     album, <i>Stereo/Mono</i> is particularly effective.  If the Paul Westerberg     of <i>Stereo</i> is a seasoned musician putting his sorrows to music in the     basement, Grandpaboy is his incorrigible alter-ego, playing spacious,     low-fidelity Stones-stampin' rock 'n' rule that evokes his Replacements days     without pandering to nostalgia.  Westerberg's even joined by a tight backing     band on <i>Mono</i>, and claims to have recorded the album in a state of     hurried, sweaty-handed irrationality-- something some of you digital     perfectionists out there might take a cue from.</p>
<p>As on <i>Stereo</i>, <i>Mono</i> moves fairly seamlessly across genres without     disrupting the essential tone of the album: the bar-brawling ""High Time"" kicks     things off somewhere between rootsy Americana and power-pop; ""Let's Not Belong     Together"" is a reverb-heavy, imperfect rockabilly number; ""Anything But That""     pits Jagger swagger against Westerberg's best 'Mats yowl.  And of the two,     <i>Mono</i> holds up as the stronger album throughout.  But only by a hair.</p>
<p>Both of these records are considerable accomplishments, considering that the     last time we heard from this guy it was on the cut-out bin damnation of     <i>Suicaine</i>'s abysmal ""Bookmark.""  Westerberg's influence was planted ir     this fertile indie rock soil back in 1982, and whether it's been bastardized     through the generations or not, you can still hear echoes of his rasped tone     deep in the mixes of today's greatest counter-cultural masterpieces. <i>Mono</i> and <i>Stereo</i> would be fine records from any musician-- that Westerberg     himself is the source makes it all the sweeter.

    way back in 1998 for their debut release, <em>Bring It On</em>, and
    they've been the darlings of the British hype machine ever since.
    Considering how well blues-inspired rock of the Gomez variety seems
    to fare overseas, that probably shouldn't be a surprise, either.
    Not that there's anything fundamentally wrong with blues-rock.  Last
    I checked, the Rolling Stones are/were fairly well regarded, and I
    think a couple of people enjoy the White Stripes, among others. If
    only Gomez could pull it off, too.</p><p>
    
    Problem is, Gomez is to the blues as Blink-182 is to punk.  The work
    of these blokes from Southshore, England is sometimes said to be
    reminiscent of Mississippi delta blues, and every time I hear that my
    heart breaks for John Lee Hooker.  In fact, did you know that B.B.
    King decided to sell his soul and shill for Burger King as a direct
    result of listening to Gomez' second album, <em>Liquid Skin</em>?  It's
    true, and the crimes against music don't end there.  Gomez has seen
    fit to unleash a third installment in their war against discerning
    audiophiles everywhere, and they call it <em>In Our Gun</em>.</p><p>
    
    If anemic blues guitar riffs and half-assed attempts at white-boy
    soul were the only problems with <em>In Our Gun</em>, it might almost
    be passable.  Instead, perhaps sensing their own shortcomings with
    the music's source material, Gomez searches far and wide for musical
    gimmicks to prop up their limp Britpop-meets-New Orleans aesthetic.
    What better way to bolster weak-kneed compositions than by making
    half-hearted stabs at a dozen other genres as well?  Everything from
    jazz sax to watered-down electronica is crammed into thirteen tracks,
    and they feel even hollower for the addition of these excesses.  The
    result is a Frankenstein's monster of an album-- overwrought and
    disjointed, executed with some technical precision, but completely
    devoid of any flow, feeling, or spontaneity.</p><p>
    
    It certainly doesn't help that these tracks, marginal compositions
    to begin with, seem to have been completely defanged by glossy
    production techniques.  This album is cleaner than Howard Hughes'
    bedroom, and the songs might have benefitted from some roughness
    around the edges.  The lone exception to most of these criticisms is
    the title track, which actually succeeds a little despite the album's
    missteps.  ""In Our Gun"" is somber and tense, with a surprisingly
    soulful chorus and, not coincidentally, it's also the most tastefully
    spare song present.  According to guitarist Ian Ball, the song was
    inspired by the 2000 U.S. election fiasco, which is evident in such
    typically incisive lyrics as, ""It's been carefully planned by the ones
    you won't see/ Send out the monkeys, they come out of the bushes/ To
    piss in the punch and then smash up the decks.""  Scary thing is,
    <em>that's</em> the best of the bunch.</p><p>
    
    ""Shot Shot,"" ""Detroit Swing 66,"" and ""Ruff Stuff"" also seem to show
    promise, but fail to develop into anything worth listening to more
    than once.  <em>In Our Gun</em> is at its best (and I use that word
    loosely) when it appears to actually construct something out of the
    formless soup of musical genres it flirts with.  At its worst, it's
    the music playing nonstop in fraternity hell after all the noisy,
    drunken jocks have left the party to go screw passed-out cheerleaders
    and the only people left are the quiet, introspective drunken jocks--
    move over, Dave Matthews!</p><p>
    
    In the end, though, all this ranting's just one man's opinion. If the
    British music press is to be believed, then rest assured that every
    single loyal Englishman thinks Gomez is the cat's pajamas.  In fact,
    if you listen closely, you might just be able to hear an islandful of
    people simultaneously proclaim me a 'stupid git.'  Er, bring it on!</p></div>"|3511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3511-in-our-gun/|2.7|Eric Carr

Think about
    Jesus.  Sure, he eventually triumphed over death, but the whole point of putting
    him on earth in the first place was to get him <em>killed</em>.  Almost every one
    of his followers was martyred, and those following in their footsteps-- monks
    and priests-- would regularly pay rueful, onerous penance, and swear to never
    have sex in their lives.  Someone sign me up!</p><p>
    
    Recently, though, religion has taken a different tack.  In a quest for fresh
    converts, Christians have spruced up their image, emphasizing the happy, fun
    times over the heritage of suffering, all in an effort to ""meet the young people
    where they're at."" Unfortunately for them, my guess is that secular youth aren't
    all smiling.  No, the under-30 crowd seem to be a bit more confused, upset and
    cynical; in a word, angstful.  Engine Down knows it because they are, too.  On
    <em>Demure</em>, the band evidences a keen empathy towards where the frowning
    youngsters are at, and it meets them there.</p><p>
    
    Singer Keeley Davis presides over Engine Down's congregation, chanting a brooding
    liturgy of angst.  His solemnity is effective in one way-- Davis' voice may tend
    towards the Kermit side (throaty), but it is rich and expressive, convincingly
    communicating cynicism and sadness.  Engine Down comes up a tad short on the
    songwriting end, though; if you've heard a chanted liturgy, you know this--
    they may be hypnotic, but they certainly aren't melodic.  In a similar way,
    Engine Down's vocals sound like moribund meditations.  Besides being simple and
    slow to develop, the melodies are uniform: from song to song, Davis laments his
    subjects in more or less the same basic fashion, rarely departing more than one
    or two tones from where he started.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, this weakness isn't fatal, and it may well be calculated.  For as
    sad as a man like Brian Wilson may have been, he rarely <em>sounded</em> it.
    There's wisdom in that there proverb: want to sound melancholy?  Do <em>not</em>
    follow the bouncing ball. Leave the bouncy, chipper melodies for the bouncy,
    chipper people.  However-- and this is a substantial however-- if you're going
    to make an album with melodic uniformity, you'd better work it out with the
    instrumentation. That shit needs to be dead-on.</p><p>
    
    In this respect, Engine Down plays a strong hand.  The instrumentation and
    orchestration on <em>Demure</em> are both equally impressive.  Guitarist Jonathan
    Fuller and bassist Jason Andrew Wood play quite well together, especially when
    utilizing counterpoint, as on the title track, where Fuller fingers a rapid
    arpeggio while Wood walks out a minor-key pattern mimicking the drum rhythm.
    The drums, courtesy of a most unfortunately named white man, Cornbread Compton,
    are as dynamic as the melodies are stagnant.  Opener ""Songbird,"" for example, is
    defined by the unsettling drum beat.  The propulsive ""Taken In"" gains its
    momentum from Compton's rolling, full-bodied tom and bass rhythm.  Moreover,
    the music fits the mood of the vocals perfectly.  The coarse, minor key guitars
    communicate the same emotions as Davis' lyrics. Likewise, the song structures
    retain a consistent tension and anxiety from odd rhythms and time signatures.</p><p>
<em>Demure</em> is a consistent release, albeit a tad formulaic and lacking in
    overall dynamism.  To fully meet the young people where they're at, the band
    would do well to play up their fondness for variety; shifting tempo, voracious
    intensity and building to crescendos all seem to be popular with the kids these
    days.  True to its title, <em>Demure</em> lacks the confidence to tread all over
    the competition, but holds its own as a pretty nice effort.</p></div>"|2788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2788-demure/|7.5|Brad Haywood

Whether
    it's a band with a sound all their own, or just a boatload of ambition, you
    can sense it in the air as their music travels through it.  The Fire Show's
    eponymous first album revealed them as a band full of ideas, and the necessary
    swagger to carry them through to interesting ends.  Released a year later, the
    mini-album <em>Above the Volcano of Flowers</em> continues that forward-thinking
    evolution.  The Fire Show's sound is built on a basic enough template of
    craftily penned post-punk anthems, but they're not afraid to deviate from that
    formula by, say, running their own material through a meat grinder of samplers
    and refashioning it as a close cousin of Warp-style IDM.</p><p>
    
    It's hard to know what to expect from the band when you first get your hands on
    this record-- it's packaged in a very plain cardboard slipcase with no information
    beyond the title, the label, and the band's website, where artwork and four extra
    MP3s can be downloaded. You can't even find the song titles on the website--
    they're all read on track eight by a voice that seems to be having some major
    problems keeping itself aligned with the space/time continuum, constantly slowing
    and speeding up, sometimes to the point of being unintelligible.  But as annoying
    as the liner notes are, the music manages to speak for itself quite nicely. The
    band's pairing with producer Brian Deck, well-known for his junkyard-bound
    kitchen sink production techniques, could hardly be more appropriate.</p><p>
    
    The disc opens as the Fire Show quietly approach you with some swelling, ambient
    guitar and quietly mixed keyboard ostinatos, then a synth and cornet hook are
    sunk deep into your eardrums.  Elastic bass throbs and pulsates as vocalist M.
    Resplendent intones, ""My mind makes debts that my body can't repay/ My heart
    keeps beating its head against the walls of this cage.""  Tense strings creep
    along in the undertow as Olias Nil's guitar tears apart the song's wordless
    second verse.  Nil's guitar is just a quick punch in the head, though, and the
    band then proceeds to rip through with the snorting, crunching middle eight.</p><p>
    
    ""Designing a Steeper Cliff"" is followed by the propulsive ""Heart Muscle Mass,""
    with a bass and drum groove worthy of any of the band's obvious forefathers
    like Gang of Four or The Fall.  Unfortunately, Resplendent's vocal limits also
    come sharply into focus on this song, which finds him wailing like a deranged
    Muppet on the song's refrain: ""Our insurrection sprang from summer's call to
    arms/ To arms!/ Heart muscle mass/ Continues to grow.""  Thankfully, this is
    really the only place where he falters, mostly sticking to a scattershot,
    declamatory delivery that befits his range quite well.</p><p>
    
    While processing and electronic flourishes have always been present
    in the Fire Show's sound, the band has never taken it as far as they
    do on ""Black &amp; White Trees Line the Paths of Sleep,"" an electronic
    reconstitution of other music from the band's catalog, all of it
    rendered unrecognizable by processing and sampling.  Stuttering beats
    and vintage synths eye each other warily as other sounds buzz in the
    background, slowly piling texture onto the beats.  The band are really
    at their best when they stick to their brand of rhythmically charged,
    experimental post-punk, but this is an interesting development in their
    sound, and its more subtle implementation in the other songs reveals
    the true promise of that direction.</p><p>
    
    The slow-motion post-punk of ""You the Ghost"" is awash in strategically
    placed drones and programming, creeping along like a less tortured
    Joy Division or Section 25.  The acoustic guitar and cooing backup
    vocal that suddenly enter to close out the song are about the last
    thing you'd expect, but it sets up the piano intro of ""Sonny Listman,
    Dead Like Latin"" beautifully.  That song then launches into more of
    the snaking post-punk that the band has basically perfected at this
    point, replete with violently mixed guitar interjections and stuck-keyed
    synths humming around the edges.</p><p>
    
    As the droning conclusion of ""Sonny Listman"" consumes itself with
    rising guitar noise, ""Bed with Ambulance Police Light on Top"" rounds
    the set out with a barrage of glitchy percussion, distorted vocals
    and freakishly hollow-sounding bass that eventually lurch to a halt
    like broken machinery.  It's a fitting end to an adventurous release
    for a band that was short-lived, but accomplished what they could when
    they could.  It's the sound of a band exploring their capabilities and
    discovering that they don't have very many, and that's a great thing
    to hear.</p></div>"|3062.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3062-above-the-volcano-of-flowers/|8.1|Joe Tangari

Twenty-one, maybe twenty-two, right?
    It seems like just yesterday he was only the tender age of fourteen,
    hammering away on his old acoustic, blessed with enough angst and
    resentment to make most teenagers envious.  But kids grow up so fast
    nowadays, don't they?  I mean here it is, eight years later, he's
    just released <em>There Is No Beginning to the Story</em>, and there's
    barely a hint of the tantrum-infused songwriting he's been prone to
    on any of his countless other releases.  Maybe he's shocked his
    critics by maturing while they weren't looking; maybe he's just
    screaming less.  Whatever the case, the latest Bright Eyes EP hints
    at the promise of better things to come.</p><p>
    
    Some of you are no doubt familiar with the standard Bright Eyes
    ouevre.  For the duration of his young career, Oberst has stuck to
    jangly, repetitive acoustic guitar work and oh-so-tortured vocals
    like a religion.  To a large extent, his caterwauling delivery and
    pent-up aggression have been the basis of his major criticisms and,
    I'll wager, the basis for some of his fanbase, too.  Yet, with
    <em>There Is No Beginning to the Story</em>, Oberst manages a nice
    balance between his more intense older material and a newer, calmer
    sound that won't alienate his fanbase, and just might even stifle
    some of his detractors.</p><p>
    
    It's still Bright Eyes, certainly, but a little less jangly and a
    little less whiny (most of the time).  These improvements aren't
    across the board, though, and there are some problematic moments.
    ""From a Balance Beam"" is stale-- yet never offensively so-- and
    ""Messenger Bird's Song,"" the one fatal misstep of this EP, is
    particularly poor: featuring Oberst at his most embarassingly
    emotive and little else, he cracks and quavers through a thin
    acoustic ballad so predictable it wears out its welcome with the
    first 'heartfelt' faltering of his voice.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, <em>There Is No Beginning</em>'s faults are more than
    compensated for by the two remaining cuts on the disc.  ""Loose Leaves""
    is, hands down, the most uncharacteristically unique tune Bright Eyes
    has produced.  It's bouncy, electric, and-- dare I say-- almost
    cheery.  The jaunty, Irish-folk inspired riff at its foundation,
    the horns, and the singsong feel combine to produce a tune so
    unabashedly catchy it's tough to believe Oberst wrote it.  Hell,
    it's just nice to get something you can sing along to, even if
    you aren't planning on hanging yourself tomorrow.  And, for a
    <i>real</i> change of pace, Oberst nearly drops the semi-precious
    waver altogether and actually <i>sings</i> on ""We Are Free Men.""
    I've got a higher tolerance for Oberst's trademark nasal whine
    than most, but his decision to tackle this one in a lower register
    improves it 100%.</p><p>
    
    Additionally, vinyl addicts are treated to two fine bonus tracks:
    ""Amy in the White Coat"" and a cover of Neil Young's ""Out on the
    Weekend.""  The eerie backing vocals on ""Amy"" are really one of the
    highlights of the EP.  This is what ""Messenger Bird's Song"" wanted
    to be before it was handicapped by over-the-top vocals-- but Oberst
    doesn't make that mistake twice.  As for the cover of Neil Young,
    I don't have the room to discuss all the possible implications;
    you either love him or hate him, but it's a solid cover, regardless.</p><p>
    
    The biggest surprise of all, though, is the lyrical quality this time
    out.  Sporting fewer trite poeticisms, the content of these songs
    comes across as less self-indulgently brooding-- even occasionally
    bordering on optimistic.  To find four (or six) more diverse Bright
    Eyes selections than those on <em>There Is No Beginning to the
    Story</em> would be difficult, if not impossible.  Here, Oberst's
    songwriting seems newly inventive, and the musicianship is tight
    all-around going into Bright Eyes' upcoming album.  For almost twenty
    minutes, he shows signs of finally growing up.  If he can keep it up
    for another fifty or so, he might be on to something.</p></div>"|936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/936-there-is-no-beginning-to-the-story-ep/|7.4|Eric Carr

    Beer One:</p><p>
    
    When I get together with people who were my friends between Bushes
    in the petty-angst cyber-nineties, we inevitably end up covered in
    doughnut glaze and gin under a pinball machine, crying about how we
    miss the Archers of Loaf. ""That angular, angular thunder!"" one of us
    moans. ""It was porcupine rock, man, porcupine rock,"" another slurs.
    In just two years, though, tallest Archer Eric Bachmann has mutated
    from a staccato-barking, dissonant chord-ninja into a twangy, pulsing,
    guttural Neil-trouba-Diamond-dour.  His latest outfit, Crooked Fingers,
    has gone from being considered Bachmann's 'post-Loaf project' to
    releasing material singularly captivating enough to suggest that he
    won't always be fending off requests for ""Harnessed In Slums"" by
    declaring to the crowd, as he did at a recent show, ""Uh, that was a
    different band.""</p><p>
    
    Beer Two:</p><p>
    
    Some months back, I had an itch to burn some of that sexy fossil fuel
    that makes the world go 'round, so I gathered up a posse to follow
    Crooked Fingers for a few days.  The first show we beheld had a
    strange vibe: the kids all had that cultivated bedhead, and the scene
    was inbred; you could tell that everyone had seen at least five
    people in their periphery naked, so they were all nerves, calculating
    complications in their one clean sub-ironic slogan t-shirt (""Try New
    Coke,"" ""Thank You, Come Again"").  Crooked Fingers set up on stage and
    then told the horn-rimmed soundman that they were going to play in
    the middle of the venue without any PA.  The unplugged songs (some of
    which are included on this EP) rang supreme, but there was initially
    something stagey about this offstage business, forcing the crowd to
    encircle them as the needy girls wet-mouthed the lyrics and stared
    do-me-ly at Bachmann, hoping for a validating glance back. This
    floor-level banjo jam seemed to be saying: O Brother, Here Pimps Us.</p><p>
    
    Beer Three:</p><p>
    
    By the fourth show, hoss, we was sold. The original venue was
    inexplicably closed, so the Fingers resourcefully set up at a bar
    down the street, but see, that bar didn't have a PA that could handle
    the band's electric segment, and the 'stage' was outside, and it was
    nipple-scab cold. You know what's next: they took it inside, to the
    crowded bar-bar, and did a 'quiet' show like no other.  The band was
    so adept, and Bachmann was so affable, that the crowd became downright
    protective of Crooked Fingers, moving tables, getting them drinks,
    verbally assaulting anyone not paying attention, and yanking the
    video games' cords out of the sockets.  By this point, my comrades
    and I realized that this down-in-the-crowd angle was a populist
    masterstroke, a way to supercede the absurdity of the pedestal-stage.
    The band made their way around the room, and eventually ended up on
    top of the thin bar counter. I'm not one who thinks that 'acoustic'
    equals 'deep' (one the lamest things I've seen was a drummerless
    version of Bachmann's Merge-mate Neutral Milk Hotel)-- but <i>damn</i>.
    The cello got caught in the ceiling fan.  Eric was a towering post-folk
    Charon, scrunching his mouth and twitching like a cartoon wino.  People
    were buying beer between their legs.  Ooh, heaven was a place on Earth.</p><p>
    
    Beer Four:</p><p>
    
    Ayyyyy!  Now entering Buzz City, baby, and my teeth can't feel each
    other.  What I've been trying, but failing to say is, I first heard
    these songs live, and they were triumphant-- so much so that this EP
    has a hard time holding up, like how Polaroids from fifth-grade Bible
    Camp don't convey how much ass the counselor-versus-ambassador tug-of-war
    kicked.  Despite this, and despite the fact that the band's live
    cover of ""Long Black Veil"" is sorely missing, this EP is hella fulla
    gold.</p><p>
    
    The same blippity keyboard-aquarium flatmosphere as the Fingers'
    other releases provides a foundation for three songs here.  The first
    of them, Kris Kristofferson's ""Sunday Morning Coming Down,"" isn't
    sublime until its chorus, during which the string instruments
    transcend the singer/songwriter swelter of the verse lyrics. The
    story of Springsteen's ""The River"" is told portentously, with a
    righteous drum-punch.  Bowie/Queen's ""Under Pressure"" should satisfy
    anyone who's ever gotten sloshed and pogoed on their own glasses at
    an Old Wave/80s night: the band scraps the riff that connotes Vanilla
    (stop, collaborate and listen), and showcases a Bachmann falsetto that
    rivals Lambchop's Kurt Wagner.  The bone-marrow bombs, however, are
    the sparse rebaptisms of Neil Diamond's ""Solitary Man"" and Prince's
    ""When U Were Mine.""  These songs and their authors are oft-covered,
    but that don't spook our boys.  Diamond's ode to stubborn bachelorhood
    is given an oompah treatment, complete with elderly-sounding ""hurmmmm's,""
    while Prince's tune is awarded a past so rich that you'll regret
    everything you ever gave away (including the Ewok sticker book) as
    the banjo and cello build to pregnant pauses so's you can gasp.</p><p>
    
    Beer Five, I Think:</p><p>
    
    You go, Merge, landing Crooked Fingers, and my other favorite band,
    Destroyer!   The Fing' is so <em>authentic</em>.  Man, Bachmann's tall.
    I wonder what that's like, being all tall and all.  My eyelids are,
    like, on fire.  This EP is the work of true disciples.  Who could win
    in a fight between Bachmann and Malkmus?  Who could win in a fight
    between nuns and sluts?  Why are bands who used to be distorted
    returning to their pop/Appalachian roots?  My grandpa doesn't
    remember my grandma. Let's play football with this rocking chair,
    and then squat under a bug zapper with these crossbows.</p></div>"|1669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1669-reservoir-songs-ep/|8.0|William Bowers

    album by herself in Room 124 of the ""Holiday Sin"" outside Altantic
    City-- that benighted second-tier den of evil, with its casinos,
    partial-nudity strip clubs and grotesquely venal boardwalk attractions.
    And this is a vulgar little record, part loopy and part seedy.  In
    fact, is that motel even a real place? Or is this a Holiday Sin...
    of the soul?</p><p>
    
    Sharp, former member of New Radiant Storm King and Skinner Pilot,
    tries to create a twisted vibe, but the record works best when it's
    good clean rock 'n' roll.  The first three songs are terrific: she
    kicks off ""Dear Krazy"" with a grungy rhythm guitar and nice, driving
    brushwork-- she's a great drummer, and she reportedly records every
    track by starting with the drums.  Guest guitarist Caleb Seavey takes
    a solo that's halfway searing.  ""Whatever Turns U On"" speeds over a
    coarse guitar riff and nicely placed keyboard fills, before Sharp
    settles down into ""The Static's Beat"" and its broad melody and catchy
    chorus.  And the last track, ""Miami Hurricanes,"" is too long, but it
    has a Sunday-on-the-boardwalk feel and an acoustic guitar part that's
    like a warm drizzle.</p><p>
    
    But outside of those tracks, Sharp runs out of ideas.  Most of the
    songs are repetitive-- maybe starting with the drum parts wasn't such
    a good idea-- and while a couple of tracks are raucous or hypnotic,
    the sound can become claustrophobic, as on the head-beatingly
    singsong ""Ruler of the Ho-dom.""  And where's the evil?  Sharp tries
    to sound loony, singing just above a murmur, but the lyrics sound
    like they come from Liz Phair's ruder younger sister.  They swing
    from the hilariously blunt ""Me &amp; My Babysitter"" (""Let's play babysitter/
    Let me sit on your face"") to the silly, indie-as-a-heart-attack
    ""Yr. Corporate Sponsor"" (""Yr corporate sponsor sucks dick/ Gives good
    head"").</p><p>
    
    The recording sounds lo-fi and rough, like the worn-out motels in
    Sharp's cover photos.  But the arrangements are impeccable: every use
    of a keyboard or toy xylophone falls right in place, the guitars are
    flawless, and aside from the frantic turn in ""Jack &amp; Ginger,"" the
    pace is machine-like.  In fact, everything's perfect, but without
    enough passable songwriting or raw lunacy to carry it: it's nasty,
    yeah, but not as nasty as promised.</p></div>"|4073.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4073-live-at-the-holiday-sin/|5.7|Chris Dahlen

    behind the bike sheds, bonobos are a species of chimpanzee.  Whereas
    your regular chimp is a vicious, antagonistic bag of misogynistic
    rage, the bonobo is a peaceable, female-respecting soul who loves to
    have sex just for the fun of it.  Bonobos are Pitchfork's kind of
    primate.  So when we received <em>Animal Magic</em>, the debut album
    by downtempo Brit Simon Green, the 'Fork knew that the collection was
    bound to get us all super-relaxed and ready for some smooth, sweet
    loving. So with a several tubs of fresh whipped cream, a punnet of
    strawberries and a French tickler or two, I set about scoring some
    love action while assessing <em>Animal Magic</em>.</p><p>
    
    In keeping with his chosen alias, Green never screams, throws tantrums,
    or is stupid enough to allow primatologists to force him to learn a
    simple noun-predicate dialect.  Green's language is already highly
    developed-- though he borrows slightly from previous Ninja Tune
    releases, he's more in sync with Memphis Industries' Blue States
    or Broadway Project, and as wryly humorous as Fort Lauderdale.</p><p>
<em>Animal Magic</em> stumbles initially: Green's gaffe is to include
    one of those hokey master-of-ceremonies intros in which some
    suited-and-booted jerk-off intones for the enjoyment of ladies and
    gentlemen. That schtick got mildewy yonks ago and for perpetuating
    such a cliché, Green needs to be roundly rebuked.  Once the intro is
    over, none of <em>Animal Magic</em> is impeachable. Though Green sifts
    through the same thrift-store record bins as Bent, he manages to
    combine his samples so as to produce tracks that transcend their
    constituents.  In other words, Bonobo avoids the wretched hamfistedness
    of Lemon Jelly.</p><p>
    
    The bewitching vocal sample that anchors ""Sleepy Seven"" reminds me of
    Blue States' ""Your Girl.""  Green doesn't make extensive use of the
    sample, instead dropping it in to subtly spice up his languid groove
    and melodica lines.  ""Dinosaurs"" is appropriately more muscular: Greer
    selects beats that are less geared to bob heads as to snap necks.  But
    to counter the violence, Green arranges somnolent trombone and sax
    snippets.  The acoustic guitar appeggios and swooshing sounds that
    begin ""Kota"" remind me of the intricate yet sleepy vibes of my favorite
    Swiss downtempo-er, Seelenluft.</p><p>
    
    During ""Terrapin,"" sitars and subdued strings weave the wordless story
    of Shiva's horizontal journey to the center of his pleasure zone.  ""The
    Plug"" tells the tale of how Shiva, upon reaching the center of his
    pleasure zone, begged never to return to the realm of strife and woe,
    and how he pleaded to remain surrounded by the sounds of gentle cymbal
    strokes, maracas, strings, and a melody played on an oboe-ish instrument
    of ineffable serenity.</p><p>
    
    Though <em>Animal Magic</em> breaks no new ground for chill-out, I'm
    overjoyed that after its initial slip into cliché, Green makes his
    debut album much greater than the sum of its parts.  Green has a real
    flair for dynamics which, in chill, is a remarkable achievement.
    <em>Animal Magic</em> is clearly the creation of a musician rather thar
    that of a zany bricoleur who has absorbed too many broadcasts of ""The
    Goons.""  With his debut securely a success, it'd be nice to see Greer
    follow the path of J. Swinscoe's Cinematic Orchestra and apply his
    composer's abilities to human musicians rather than an array of sound
    files.  Now.  May I tempt you with a cream-dipped strawberry, sweet
    thing?</p></div>"|853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/853-animal-magic/|7.6|Paul Cooper

    don't make me want to dance, the only real problem with <em>Souljacker</em>,
    Eels' fourth album, is that it just seems like an underachievement.
    I've never been a big fan of artists who play it cool on record: that
    is, appear to toss off musical ideas when their fans, their press
    releases and even signs hidden in their own music suggest they should
    be doing a lot more.  Take someone like Prince: a guy with talent to
    burn, and without the pressure of having to establish himself or
    compromise his art to appease a greedy record label-- so why am I
    lucky to get even two decent jams per album from him since about
    1987?  Similarly, artists like Eels, led by frontman E (Mark Oliver
    Everett) seem like they have a wealth of raw material to work with,
    yet are often content to settle for middle-of-the-road filler-pop.</p><p>
    
    If Neutral Milk Hotel suddenly got a million bucks to record at the
    best studio in L.A., with access to hundreds of studio musicians and
    music-biz insiders, I'm not sure it would make the music any better.
    Mangum takes odds-and-ends and a four-track and makes incredible
    music anyway.  I think the key is that he started with good songs and
    expanded from there, whereas bands like Eels just seem to be dumbing
    down every aspect of their stuff for who knows what purpose.  I hope
    it's not to get radio play, because if so, it isn't working.   I
    haven't heard much Eels on my FM dial since their modest 1996 hit
    ""Novocaine for the Soul.""</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Dog Faced Boy"" starts innocently enough, with a faux lo-fi
    glam guitar hook and primal drumming.  E's raspy vocals still sound a
    bit thin to my ears, which doesn't help when delivering ominous lines
    like, ""Ma won't shave me/ Jesus won't save me, Dog Faced Boy.""  Wher
    the shakers come in, I wonder whether this was supposed to be single
    material-- something that might appeal to those ornery Gen-X rascals.
    ""That's Not Really Funny"" picks things up with its good-natured
    carnival-band hook, and more faux lo-fi guitar.  (If you're wondering,
    I keep making the 'faux' distinction because it's hard to imagine any
    album funded by Spielberg and company being forced to use bad amps or
    equipment.)  It could be a good effect-- just ask Beck-- but again,
    the tune and the wacky atmosphere just aren't interesting enough or
    their own to give Eels the benefit of the doubt.  And, when they're
    dropping lines like, ""You say a lot of funny things, my little bunny,""
    just to get a rhyme for the chorus, things take a turn from the
    underachieving to the just-plain-sad.</p><p>
    
    I don't want to dwell on the negative (even though the VH1-approved
    'sophistication' of ""Woman Driving, Man Sleeping,"" and the fake punk
    of ""What Is This Note"" do their best to force me to).  Eels car
    occasionally turn out a nice tune-- exhibit A is the squeaky clear
    ""Fresh Feeling,"" with its tasteful orchestration and (this is
    important) strong melody.  It probably won't win them any indie
    points, as it's closer to an Alanis-style ballad-with-a-beat than to
    NMH, but it might conceivably have a life beyond this record via
    adult-contemporary radio.  Exhibit B is the surprisingly potent
    one-two punch of ""World of Shit"" and ""Souljacker, Part II.""  The
    former takes some melodramatic piano lines, subtle productions tricks
    like bells playing backwards and nice string lines, and manages to
    overcome some seriously unfortunate lyrical choices (""Let's get
    married, and make some people"").  This leads into the latter track,
    a short, dreamy tune featuring mellotron and actual lo-fi ambience!
    Well, I suppose that could have been injected in there to appeal to
    the, you know, underachieving indie crowd or something, but it sounds
    okay.  The point is, even when the results are middling, at least Eels
    never sink into lame radio-rock clichés.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, though, I'm left with the feeling that a band that displays
    a fine grasp of orchestral pop and baroque studio flourishes on some
    tracks should be delivering something better than <em>Souljacker</em>.
    It could be that since most of the songs don't have great melodies
    (and supplant them with odd, fluffy lyrics), any attempt to juice
    them up with lightly eclectic production was doomed from the start.
    Then again, if you're going to show everyone your cards and
    demonstrate that you <i>can</i> come up with good melodies and neat
    production, it seems a waste not to capitalize on it for the whole
    ride.  As it stands, Eels are still in the middle of the pack for
    underachievers-- I'll take Prince's last album over this one.</p></div>"|2686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2686-souljacker/|4.9|Dominique Leone

The wink and the nod, the teeth bared
    in an all-too-knowing smile: the little assurances that we're In Or
    It.  Protestations abound-- ""I just like the music!""-- but haven't
    done much to lift the stench from disco and heavy metal after they've
    been dragged through the ghetto of ironic appreciation.  You might
    have a white belt in your closet, or a Poison tape on your dash, but
    at what point do you find yourself with the aging hipsters in the
    back of some stagnant bar?  As psychologists, Patrice Carrié and
    Jean-Philippe Freu might be able to tell us, if they weren't the ones
    spinning the wheels of the fetish machine.</p><p>
    
    They are &lt;&lt; RixF4çérôse &gt;&gt;: shrinks by day, purveyors of shrink-wrapped
    dance music by night.  In the wake of Daft Punk, France has leaked
    out a whole slew of retro hucksters.  Of course, the promotional
    nut-jobbing you'll read on the net does what it can to distinguish
    the daft funk of &lt;&lt; RixF4çérôse &gt;&gt; from that of the helmeted househeads
    par excellence.  The former are from far away in little Montpellier, you
    see, and they've revitalized the dance world using the one instrument
    you'd never expect-- the guitar.  Surprise!  They're only following
    Blur's ""Boys and Girls"" by about seven years, not to mention their owr
    countrymen Phoenix (who are far better at kitschy revisionism, by the
    way).</p><p>
    
    They call their second full-length <em>Music Kills Me</em>, fittingly
    enough.  The first time I heard it, I thought it'd been composed
    posthumously, in the way that Miles Davis' <em>Doo-Bop</em> was pieced
    together after he'd passed away. ""Le Rock Summer"" kicks off with some
    upbeat bongos-- yeah, it's going to be painful like that.  The duo
    tear pages from Giorgio Moroder's fakebook,  yet end up with ar
    appallingly stale string sound.  They must think that guitar vamps
    somehow make things lively, but the wanky improv renders every moment
    unbearable.  Disco inferno, indeed.</p><p>
    
    At least the opener's an instrumental.  The title track nabs Durar
    Duran's lead riff from ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" and features some
    mildly interesting acidic synthwork.  Then we're graced with the
    strained platitudes of Emmanuel Djob: ""When I'm feeling alone,
    nothing gets me like music!""  Please try and imagine it repeated ad
    nauseam, sung with the conviction of Dave Matthews at his most
    constipated.  This song is so square it makes Huey Lewis sound hip.</p><p>
    
    ""It's Time to Go Now!"" pops open a canned flute sample and loops it
    as the sole melody for three minutes.  It's a flute!  It's a loop!
    It's a flute it's a loop it's a flute it's a loop-- say it out loud.
    That's the cadence of every generic house rhythm &lt;&lt; RixF4çérôse &gt;&gt; sets
    down. Yet the liner notes list legions of live contributors, from
    brass players to percussionists.  It's clear a new record has beer
    set for antiseptic, inhuman songwriting.  Cassius suddenly has hope
    that there's life after <i>1999</i>, and Air have a chance to clean up
    after their <i>10,000 Hz</i> shitstain.</p><p>
    
    It gets worse. ""Lost Love"" incorporates elements of ""M"" by the Cure,
    but an obnoxious chorus (""You'll fall in love with somebody else
    tonight"") keeps cycling through the song, bastardizing 60s soul and
    leaving the mood more fruity than gloomy.  Their turn towards the
    dark side comes later, on ""Professeur Suicide,"" which attempts to
    breed porno-flick funk with deep house.  The singer makes light of it
    all with one snide, breathily repeated line: ""Suicide.""  Edgy!
    Right-wingers everywhere cower as another argument for euthanasia
    is born.</p><p>
    
    To be fair, the previous album <em>Installation Sonore</em> was
    supposedly much better, and fans lament the passing of their unique
    sound.  There's still traces of it, as on ""No, We Are Not
    Experienced,"" which begins softly but then builds into an intense,
    psychedelic peak.  But that was then, and this is shit.  The rest of
    the album descends into easy-listening shopping-mall chic; ever
    Dimitri from Paris wouldn't mix it into one of his sets.  Like the
    painting on the cover of Jean-Philippe's red sportscar, &lt;&lt; RixF4çérôse &gt;&gt;
    is flashy and slick and trying far too hard to be haute couture.  Or is
    <em>Music Kills Me</em> is a concept album about the death of art in ar
    age of artifice?  Do you really want to be the subject of their
    psychology experiment?  If so, this is your summer album-- all the
    clichés from French pop and house music collected in one shiny
    package.</p></div>"|6790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6790-music-kills-me/|2.7|Christopher Dare

Relaxing after a long session
    hammering out trade sanctions, human rights accords, and peacekeeping
    missions, the delegates have retired to the local disco for a night
    of lettin' loose and puttin' their <em>weight</em> on it!   On one side
    of the dance floor, the British and French delegates are ignoring
    centuries of rivalry in order to do a mean freak nasty on each other.
    Representatives from Russia, Peru, and Laos rope people into doing
    the Electric Slide.  People form a circle around the delegate from
    Syria, who is giving a full ceremonial dress demonstration of his
    reputed breakdancing prowess.</p><p>
    
    If these throwdowns really do occur down at the old UN, the DJ has no
    doubt been primarily spinning <em>Handcream for a Generation</em>, the
    latest release from London-by-way-of-India Cornershop.  This album,
    with its effortless genre-hopping and EPCOT cultural sampling, is the
    most globalist musical statement since Michael Jackson's video for
    ""Black or White""-- though, uh, minus the crotch-grabbing and car-smashing.
    Ringleader Tjinder Singh has spent the last five years throwing
    musical influences from every region of the planet into his giant
    melting pot, ending up with a record so multi-culti it's received
    funds from the World Bank and been name-dropped in a Sunday column by
    Thomas Friedman.</p><p>
    
    That Cornershop would be the band to take this ""It's a Small World""
    approach is no big surprise, given the poly-ethnic nature of their
    previous records for David Byrne's Luaka Bop imprint.  The band broke
    out of the world music ghetto with 1997's <em>When I Was Born for the
    7th Time</em>, an album that delighted in throwing traditional Indian
    heritage and instrumentation up against pretty much every Western
    music style in the book.  Somewhat overrated by the sitar-happy
    critical population, <em>7th Time</em> nevertheless had a handful of
    great, inventive pop songs (""Brimful of Asha,"" ""Good to Be On the
    Road Back Home Again"") amidst an overabundance of interesting-once-or-twice
    sound collage filler and a gimmicky Punjabi ""reclamation"" of ""Norwegian
    Wood.""</p><p>
<em>Handcream</em>, by comparison, is even more of a shape-shifter than
    its acclaimed predecessor, and likewise, it's less uneven and cohesive.
    Changing outfits as often as a runway model, Cornershop jumps from
    soul-funk roll call intro to children's choir-accompanied synth-rock
    to glowstick-waving house to organ-loop hip-hop to Jamaican reggae
    dub, and that's only counting up to the halfway point.  It's an
    exhilarating but disorienting ride, given the big budget production,
    the rapid-fire guest appearances (including Noel Gallagher and Rob
    Swift), and a relentlessly upbeat pace tightly calibrated to provoke
    shaking of the booty in all races.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, this versatility indicates that Singh isn't looking to
    further pad his bank account with a collection of profitable ""Asha""
    clones.  Among the album's twelve tracks, only ""Staging the Plaguing
    of the Raised Platform"" and ""Lessons Learned from Rocky I to Rocky
    III"" land close to their big hit's on-loan-from-Luna chord
    progression and singsong melody.  While neither tune has the memory
    claws of ""Asha"" (which I'll bet five dollars is running through your
    head right this second), ""Raised Platform"" has some delightfully
    catchy nonsense lyrics about Jaws and dodos, and the thick-riffed
    ""Rocky"" narrowly survives an appearance by that most insidious of
    rock cliches, the gospel backup singer.</p><p>
    
    The rest is kept strictly mirrorball, highlighted by the Studio 54
    glitter promised on Singh's politics-and-disco side project Clinton.
    Upgrading that group's ""People Power"" from ironic bare-bones disco to
    the real deal itself, the song grooves along to swear bleeps, phone
    rings, and cricket chirps, promising socialism through leisure suits
    and feathered boas.  ""The London Radar"" has a similar amount of fun
    with modernized <em>Saturday Night Fever</em> elements, soldering a
    bunch of airline-related sound clips to swirling strings and popping
    bass.  ""Music Plus One"" and ""Slip the Drummer One"" are dance tracks
    more ecstacy than cocaine, employing vocoders, synthesizers, and
    turntable scratches courtesy of X-Ecutioner Swift (on loan from Linkin
    Park, we see).</p><p>
    
    While these tracks are indicative of Cornershop's ability to enjoyably
    replicate different eras of nightclub music, one often gets the feeling
    that the band's just trying on costumes without much in the way of
    original modifications.  Drafting Chicago soulman Otis Clay for emcee
    duties on the opening ""Heavy Soup"" and a Rasta for the Lee Perry homage
    ""Motion the 11"" lends authenticity to the band's genre explorations,
    but also dilutes their own sound by easing up on the Punjabi elements.
    There aren't many fresh hybrid creations in the vein of <em>7th Time</em>'s
    Automator-produced Bolly-Wu ""Candy Man"" here, unless you count the
    cumbersome 14-minute ""Spectral Mornings,"" which attempts to pit late
    '60s Dead against Side A of <em>The Concert for Bangladesh</em>.</p><p>
    
    With so much stylistic hopscotch, the album feels a little disjointed
    as well, despite mysterious recurring vocal samples of song titles
    (""slip the drummer one,"" ""motion the eleven"") popping up in unexpected
    places.  As multilingual, uncategorizable, culture-spanning concept
    albums by artists with ""Corn"" in their moniker, Cornelius' <em>Point</em>
    has <em>Handcream</em> beat by a long shot.  But with a record so obviously
    intended to make you dance first and ask questions later, such analysis
    is fairly irrelevant. Tjinder Singh and Cornershop want to throw a
    world party down at the discotheque, and in the wake of tragic <em>Ally
    McBeal</em> cancellations and David Beckham injuries, dancin's probably
    just what us six billion kids need.</p></div>"|1612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1612-handcream-for-a-generation/|7.6|Rob Mitchum

Here's why: you're not French.
    Perhaps it's not the only reason, but no matter how scrawny,
    ugly or foul-smelling you are, if your lips manage to pronounce
    those delicate, lilting tones of the language of love, it is
    <em>on</em>.  Promise.</p><p>
    
    Some of my best friends are French-- they have, like, ten dates
    a night, usually three or four at a time.  Unfortunately for
    TTC, though, hip-hop isn't about romance. Unlike making love,
    French language skills tend to be a liability in the world of
    beats and rhymes.  You know what I mean; just imagine a French
    accent on badasses like Rakim or Jay-Z: ""how you say-- errr-- Beeg
    Peemping?""  Not quite.</p><p>
    
    Despite the disability, hip-hop has followed in the footsteps of
    another traditionally African-American art form-- jazz-- in gaining
    a substantial following with the Gauls.  But probably owing to the
    reasons noted above, American audiences have yet to pay a return
    favor to French acts, notwithstanding the critical acclaim showered
    on torch-bearers like MC Solaar.  TTC hopes to put an end to the
    trend with their first-rate sophomore effort, <em>Ceci N'est Pas un
    Disque</em>.</p><p>
    
    Chances are, if you're considering a TTC purchase, you won't be
    making it for the lyrics.  In light of that, allow me to brief
    you for a moment on the beats.  They're a superb and diverse bunch,
    evidencing influence of American old-school and underground hip-hop
    alike.  From the playfulness of the opener, ""Nonscience,"" to the
    spooky sci-fi of the El-P inflected ""Subway,"" it's all inventive and
    surprisingly well-produced.</p><p>
    
    The DJ Vadim-helmed ""De Pauvres Riches"" utilizes a sparse, quirky
    beat built on a curious bass clarinet melody and accompanied by
    almost comically intermittent orchestral embellishments.  The unique
    ""Pollutions"" opens with four measures of a bass-lipped human beatbox,
    which is joined by an organ melody that is almost the exact replica
    of the background music from Abba's ""Dancing Queen,"" as well as the
    crackles and pops of vintage vinyl.  The odd blend of two worlds
    (disco and hip-hop) delightfully provokes concurrent nostalgia and
    head-nodding.</p><p>
    
    The album's finest beat appears on ""Ensoulevant le Couvercle,""
    knee-deep in thick production.  The dark, ominous beat rests on a
    foundation of simple, downtempo drums, with synth horns and organ
    insinuating a chilling background ""melody,"" if you can call it that
    (it sounds more like an echo). The song plods along, a more pervasive
    pipe organ gurgling intermittently along with the rhythmic ambience
    of creaky floorboards.  It's better described by the emotions evoked:
    doom, confusion, and funk. </p><p>
    
    In terms of lyrics, it's anyone's guess. I can tell you this: one of
    the MC's, who I dubbed ""Ad-Rocque"", struck me as rather annoying.  He
    sounds like your run-of-the-mill white-boy MC who tries to affect a
    voice he doesn't have.  As for the others, I have no problems with
    them, even though I don't understand a damn word. Which brings us
    back to the opening point; except for two English cameos (Dose One on
    ""Pas D'Armure"" and Yara Bravo on ""Ensoulevant Le Couvercle"") the
    album is entirely in French, so don't expect the kids in Bushwick and
    Bed-Stuy to be stocking up on copies of TTC.  But should you? Think
    of it this way: TTC scores an 8.0 on beats alone.  Hand the mic to
    Del, and we're probably staring at a 9.5.  Hand it to Gwen Stefani,
    and we're back down to 7.0.  Either way, you get the point-- you like
    beats, you buy this album.  End of story.</p></div>"|8177.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8177-ceci-nest-pas-un-disque/|8.0|Brad Haywood

    music that works well in the background.  He takes electronic
    production techniques (a loop here, a glitch there), splices
    in a healthy mix of acoustic instrumentation (guitar, piano, some
    light strings), and takes most of the edge off in the mix.  That
    Hawkins plays it cool isn't a criticism, though.  In fact, if you
    go by the praise of recent releases by Boards of Canada or Fennesz,
    it might very well be a recommendation.  If only <em>Placement Issues</em>
    were as consistently interesting as the music of those artists, I
    could extend that praise to Sybarite.</p><p>
<em>Placement Issues</em> is actually a collection of all of Sybarite's
    singles to this point, taken from various EPs (1999's <em>Meusic</em>
    and 2000's <em>Otonomy</em>) and seven-inch releases.  Conventional
    logic says that singles collections don't hold up as albums in the
    same way as proper LPs, but Sybarite shoots down this wisdom with
    his consistency in production and the fact that many of his tunes
    share similar moods.  It's not that all of his music sounds the same,
    though you'd be forgiven for not picking up on the fact not all of
    the tunes were recorded at the same time, for the same project.</p><p>
    
    Many of these tracks would fit perfectly into a film: ""Second Cities,""
    with that patented Boards of Canada smooth groove and light acoustic
    guitar, might figure prominently into a pensive midnight driving
    scene around downtown Los Angeles. ""Otonomy"" retains the pensive mood
    and guitar, but subdues the atmosphere for a misty nostalgia. Sybarite's
    apparent fondness for consonance and rounded edges may put off those
    looking for something more tart, though his knack for melody and
    efficient arrangements is impressive enough that, at its best, this
    music works well beyond any cinematic backdrop.  ""Square One"" is a
    particularly engaging example of how relatively traditional sound
    design and minimal harmonic coloring can be used to great effect.
    The high-pitched, stuttering rhythm (something like a stopwatch
    accompanied by a triangle) underscores a repetitive, mournful guitar
    figure, while various subtle glitches work their way in and out of the
    mix.  As good soundtrack music doesn't distract from the images
    onscreen, it's not hard to picture this bit of finery supporting a
    vigorous session of daydreaming.</p><p>
    
    Not everything works as well in a supportive function: ""Unforced
    Force of the Truth"" features an up-tempo, shuffling beat, distorted
    just enough to stand out on an album full of airtight programming.
    The slightly angular guitar line (which wouldn't sound out of place
    on a Tortoise record) is joined by moderately searing synth and a
    discordant whistling chord floating over the electronic ensemble.
    ""The Sweep"" is smooth enough, except for the omnipresent, static-y
    effect that fills in every empty space in the tune.  The analog drum
    machine pulse reminds me of early Mouse on Mars, though the noise
    quotient is more along the lines of Fennesz.  And if the looped guitars
    that open ""Without Engagement"" sound a little too similar to those
    that open ""Engaged,"" well, they should-- they're the same guitars.</p><p>
    
    The pitfall in records like <em>Placement Issues</em> is not in the
    individual moments, but rather in the difficulty of keeping the
    moments distinct as you listen to the entire record.  After an hour
    or so of atmospheric synthesizers and smooth beats, my ears start to
    wilt a bit, though I'm sure any one of these tunes could hit the spot
    under the right circumstances. Sybarite's got a knack for nailing the
    moment, and if you don't mind the fact many of the moments share
    moods, <em>Placement Issues</em> works.</p></div>"|7677.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7677-placement-issues/|6.2|Dominique Leone

    around.  Since the early 90s, when bands like Shrimp Boat and the
    Coctails began to make their marks, the Chicago underground has grown
    by leaps and bounds to become one of the largest, most prolific and
    inbred indie scenes in the world.  It's even begun to absorb bands
    and personnel from other Midwestern metropolises like Louisville and
    St. Louis, extending absorptive psuedopods outward like some giant
    metropolitan amoeba.</p><p>
    
    And, of course, when these guys aren't recording or touring with
    their own bands, they're playing on their friends' albums left and
    right, leaving a string of credits a mile long behind each of the
    scene's main constituents.  Suffice to say that Six Degrees of Fred
    Lonberg-Holm isn't a very hard game.  Hell, he's even on this L'altra
    disc that I'm writing about right now, along with a few other Chicago
    scenesters you might recognize, like Charles Kim and Robert Cruz.
    And then there's the fact that L'altra shares member Eben English
    with fellow Chicagoans Del Rey.</p><p>
    
    Naturally, the real reason guys like Longberg-Holm get called to play
    on so many albums is simply that they're amazing musicians, and
    selfless ones at that.  On the occasions that you can hear his
    familiar cello on <em>In the Afternoon, he plays flawlessly,
    never making for the spotlight and stepping aside for the quartet's
    full-time members.  The only problem with this is that the band
    doesn't seem especially comfortable there, and as a result the album
    is a bit lacking in conviction.</em></p><p>
    
    Though L'altra's penchant for musical understatement is quite appealing,
    the humility of the vocals doesn't serve them as well.  The male/female
    interplay of Joe Costa and Lindsay Anderson is effective to a point, but
    they're good enough singers that they could easily make each song more
    memorable by merely projecting more and attacking the already good
    melodies with more vigor and enthusiasm.  I won't dwell on this too much,
    as it's likely a concern that many listeners won't have, but for me, it's
    the biggest reason L'altra's third album doesn't stick especially well.</p><p>
    
    That said, the band do manage to conjure an alluring atmosphere for most
    of <em>In the Afternoon</em>, creating a series of rich musical tapestries
    to back their lazily delivered vocal musings. ""Traffic"" opens with a wash
    of aquatic keyboards and finishes wrapped in a veil of swelling guitars.
    Those guitars stick around for ""Ways Out,"" coloring in the song's dark
    corners until being overtaken by vibes and violin halfway through.  It's
    the subtle touches like that that really make <em>In the Afternoon</em>
    worth listening to.</p><p>
    
    Otherwise, the album is basically just a pleasant, atmospheric diversion.
    The band nudges the tempo forward a bit on ""Black Arrow"" and ""Broken
    Mouths,"" which features a striking, classically bound piano part that
    manages to dominate everything but the drums.  In fact, drummer Ken Dyber
    (also the owner of Aesthetics Records) is frequently the element that
    keeps everything interesting, lending steady momentum to even the most
    ambling moments.</p><p>
    
    The album ends with ""Goodbye Music,"" a stirring instrumental lullaby
    that closes the proceedings on a high note.  Lonberg-Holm's cello
    rides low beneath Anderson's piano, framed by washes of mallet-struck
    cymbals and violin counterpoint.  If the production were more prominent
    on more of the band's songs, they could have something really fantastic
    on their hands.  As it is, L'altra is a band with obvious strengths and
    talent that ought to be more confident in displaying them.</p></div>"|4651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4651-in-the-afternoon/|7.1|Joe Tangari

    was that another Icelandic band was making music as pretty and epic
    as Sigur Rós. Those tuning into the hype were surprised when they
    finally heard <em>Yesterday Was Dramatic, Today Is Okay.</em>  On their
    debut album, Múm sounded like a melodic laptop outfit with a curiosity
    about acoustic instruments. Nothing about the record suggested the
    word ""band.""  Sure, there were some ""la-la"" vocals here and there,
    a good amount of accordion and the occasional guitar, but Bogdar
    Raczynski's last record had all those qualities in equal measure
    and he never lost his IDM identity. However Múm were presented,
    there was no mistaking the quality of the music.</p><p>
    
    With their second full-length album <em>Finally We Are No One</em>, Múm
    definitely sounds like a 'band', in the traditional sense of the word.
    Almost half the tracks feature proper vocals singing songs; the horns,
    strings and accordion are even more evident; and the modular synthesizer
    patches have been relegated to the background.  The band continues to
    build its rhythmic foundation around glitch-inspired beats, but the
    sound surrounding the clicks and pops is more conventionally musical.
    How you feel about this new development will depend on which path you
    hoped Múm would follow.  If the marching voices that emerged at the
    tail end of ""There Is a Small Number of Things"" were what moved you,
    then you'll find <em>Finally We Are No One</em> very much to your liking.
    If, on the other hand, you found the sprightly beat programming and
    warm synth chords of ""I'm 9 Today"" and ""Awake on a Train"" to be the
    foundation of what made <em>Yesterday Was Dramatic</em> so great, you'll
    find yourself enjoying this one a little less.</p><p>
    
    To my ears, the closer Múm gets to conventional song structures, the
    less appealing the band is.  At its heart, Múm is not bestowed with
    the gift of melody, and too many of the tunes here come across as
    simplistic and trite. ""We Have a Map of the Piano"" has the same lead
    line as the familiar keyboard exercise ""Heart and Soul"" (I'm not
    suggesting they stole the melody-- I doubt the band has even heard
    it-- but I can't think of anything else when I listen to this track).
    While it adds to the innocent cast of the tune, it does little to
    encourage repeat plays. ""Don't Be Afraid, You Have Just Got Your Eyes
    Closed"" and the first half of ""K/Half Noise"" are similarly powered by
    the kind of inane four-note melody a toddler might dream up.</p><p>
    
    With all that out of the way, the fact remains that this is still a
    good album, if not a great one.  Despite containing a few tunes that
    grate with their simple-minded sweetness, a handful of others are
    excellent.  Released earlier as a single, ""Green Grass of Tunnel"" is
    far and away their best stab at conventional songwriting, with a
    whimsical melody appropriate to the music-box backing and a nice mix
    of organ, accordions, and strings.  The title track, an instrumental,
    also displays a sense of balance, as it moves from dark, crunching
    sounds in its first third to a nice melody doubled on violin and
    trumpet, before returning to its murky resting place amid gurgles of
    distortion at the end.  The lengthy closer ""The Land Between Solar
    Systems"" is pretty great, building from near silence to a low-grade
    fever pitch, unfolding like an epic Quickspace tune in extreme slow
    motion.</p><p>
    
    I understand that the child's-view angle is a large part of Múm's
    appeal, and I don't mean to discount this approach to music-- as a
    devoted fan of Nobukazu Takemura, I'd be a hypocrite to argue against
    it.  But something's missing from Múm's relentless pursuit of beauty
    and innocence: a sense of struggle.  They're almost too good at making
    simple, pretty music at this point, and the tracks content to pursue
    these qualities alone come across as fluffy.  With the digital aspect
    of the sound played down in favor of uncomplicated acoustic melodies,
    Múm seems just a bit less substantial.</p></div>"|5505.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5505-finally-we-are-no-one/|7.5|Mark Richard-San

Dismissed 'em as
    second-generation Georgia retro-pop-- well-executed but by-the-numbers
    70s psych-rock with a bunch of chord changes snatched outta Lou Reed's
    ass pocket.  But one day, I came around to these small-town, tousle-headed
    geeks.  Seemed the closer I listened, the more I became aware of the
    subtle differences that came with the hints of Middle Eastern melody,
    the quick bits of slide guitar, the occasional accordian or flute or
    organ, and the sporadic bursts of feedback scattered sparsely through
    albums like <em>The Winter Is Coming</em> and <em>A Dream in Sound</em>.</p><p>
    
    Sure, the songs were simple and even a bit derivative, but there was
    enough unique flavor to each one to keep things interesting, while
    still definable within the vague boundaries of rock music.  They were
    no longer just normal pop songs-- they were dark pop songs, cold pop
    songs, desolate pop songs.  The moods matched the subtle changes in
    timbre which were both unexpected and stunning.  But now these Elf Power
    kids got a new album, and though I hate to say it, I might as well be
    frank: it sorta sucks.</p><p>
    
    Yeah, it's still got those fuzzy and jangly guitars.  And yeah, there's
    still gentle vocals about goofy shit-- monsters and creatures and all
    that, but there's nothing that actually steps forward or makes an attempt
    to stick out.  Tracks like ""Let the Serpent Sleep"" are built around
    strikingly familiar melodies (in the case of the title cut, one of their
    own); ""Visions of the Sea"" sounds like a sped-up version of R.E.M.'s
    ""Sweetness Follows.""  ""Everlasting Scream"" is distorted twee-vocals
    over Ramones-inspired (though to say ""inspired"" might be stretching it)
    three-chord rock.  There are a ton of acoustic guitar-based tracks that
    drift right on by-- like they aren't even there!-- despite the attempts
    by a cello on ""The Modern Mind,"" a twangy steel-pedal guitar on ""The
    Creature,"" and violin practically everywhere else.  Problem is, where
    Elf Power previously made every extra instrument sound like an essential
    part of their songs, here, these things just sound like last-minute
    additions aimed at making one song sound remotely different from the
    next.</p><p>
    
    Maybe I shouldn't be so tough on the guys.  After all, I know what
    rejection feels like, and Elf Power's been through a few tough
    breaks of their own lately-- what with bigshot producer Dave Fridmann
    moving on to greener pastures with Mogwai and former member Bryan
    Poole leaving the band to rock out with the drummer of Jucifer.
    Maybe that's why the new album sounds so faint and distant, and why
    this new Elf Power seems only a shadow of their former selves.</p><p>
    
    But sympathy or no, these guys just aren't nailing it on <i>Creatures</i>.
    Elf Power always stood out as one of the few Elephant 6 bands capable
    of pulling off the Phil Spector-on-a-budget thing.  And they didn't
    even have to make it their trademark!  Instead, they'd employ the
    technique sparingly, and even manage it with subtlety and respect
    for the song's basic structure. These days, they don't even try,
    whether that's from some misguided stab at so-called maturity, or
    just overconfidence in their formula. </p><p>
<em>Creatures</em> sees a band trying desperately to hang on to a
    sound that's clearly gone-- kidding themselves into thinking the same
    old routines will still work, sans Bryan.  It's a sham, miserable and
    obvious.  The group's remaining members need to wake up, to reevaluate,
    to cease living in the past, to change, to adapt, to allow themselves
    to become something different.  Otherwise, they're just another little
    indie band in a sea of little indie bands, and though that might sound
    cute on paper, it's not.</p></div>"|2746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2746-creatures/|5.5|David M. Pecoraro

Amps for
    Christ mainman Henry Barnes makes music too out of step, too varied
    and too fucked up for anyone to front him the money for serious
    studio time.  It's never going to happen.  But instead of becoming
    bitter and frustrated, he records his music carefully and cheaply and
    releases it on labels like Shrimper-- imprints unconcerned with
    image, fashion or sales.  This process gives him the opportunity to
    realize his wide-ranging vision of machine-damaged folk music. <em>The
    Oak in the Ashes</em> feels like a yellowed artifact from a parallel
    world, one where Celtic drones, beat poetry, African percussion,
    Persian ballads, classic-rock guitar solos, power tools and free jazz
    all find equal footing.  I like this place.</p><p>
    
    The 23 tracks on <em>The Oak in the Ashes</em> are carefully selected
    and sequenced so that no single style of music ever becomes too
    prevalent, and listener fatigue never sets in.  ""She's With Me"" and
    ""Give/Leave"" are both lovely folk songs in the British style, combining
    plucked acoustic guitar, fiddle and spare use of feedback, the latter
    even adding just a bit of Lynyrd Skynyrd to the mix.  The anthemic
    guitar instrumental ""Scotland the Brave/Ditches"" has Barnes tuning his
    Les Paul like a bagpipe and running it through the distortion pedal.
    ""Nese 1"" and ""Nese 2"" are both Middle Eastern folk songs, with Tara
    Tikki Tavi offering vocals in (I believe) Persian, accompanied by
    Barnes' acoustic guitars and assorted percussion.</p><p>
    
    The iffy tracks on <em>The Oak in the Ashes</em> are confined to the
    spoken word pieces, most of which find Barnes reciting
    Ginsberg-inspired poetry about the environment over a drumbeat.
    The words aren't particularly embarrassing, they just add little to
    the overall thrust of the album.  Fortunately, these pieces are short
    interludes of a minute or less, so their presence is never terribly
    distracting.  And it's well worth sitting through these to hear the
    unusual textures Barnes wrings out of his various homemade instruments
    on ""She Saw"" and ""Scotland the Brave/Cheeks"" (a reprise of the drone
    melody of ""Scotland the Brave/Ditches"" translated to some wheezing
    keyboard instrument).  The live and crudely recorded ""Mission
    Accomplished"" begins with somebody tuning up a power drill and then
    the machine competes in a furious duet with a Coltrane-inspired sax
    on a tune that would fit right in on <em>Crescent</em>.  The screams
    from the players as the track fades out attests to their enthusiasm.</p><p>
    
    The eight-minute ""Prepared Hammond for 5 Hands"" closes the album with
    a blast of the kind of noisy ""power electronics"" Barnes contributes
    to Eric Wood's Bastard Noise project, a dense amalgamation of machine
    skree and analog electronics that manages to remain just this side of
    annoying.  It's a fitting end to this document of one man's inspiring
    vision.  Most everyone will love and hate at least one track here, but
    I'm glad to know that we're living in an age when a record this weird
    and all over the place is only a click or two away.</p></div>"|173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/173-the-oak-in-the-ashes/|7.3|Mark Richard-San

The
    jazzy vocals, smooth horn arrangements, and bursts of cheery strings
    were a welcome respite from crunchy guitar, back when the downtown
    hipsters developed ironic attachments to Burt Bacharach and learned
    to mix martinis.  The lounge craze of the mid-90s was all about
    kitsch and secondhand space-age dinnerware. Maybe you liked the
    music, maybe you actually owned a CD, but the only place you ever
    listened to it was while vintage shopping or appropriating the
    mannerisms of middle-aged swingers circa 1965 at your lowbrow
    cocktail hour.</p><p>
    
    Orchestral pop was resuscitated right about the time Burt Bacharach
    records were rescued from thrift-store record rack graves and their
    creator lauded as a genius and inspiration to people who, two years
    before, would have scoffed at the mention of his name.  Jazzed-up
    orchestral pop became the form of choice for one-time rock-and-rollers,
    save for the ever-popular acoustic, confessional folk.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us to Sarah Shannon.  Her old band, Velocity Girl, once
    post-grunge Sub Pop's biggest seller, got a considerable amount of
    attention in the early/mid-90s before breaking up and disappearing
    from the radar entirely sometime in 1996.  Being the only girl in an
    otherwise male band is never easy. Some regarded the Shannon as little
    more than a pretty face, a charismatic frontwoman to deck the cover of
    <em>Alternative Press</em> and represent the ideal woman for smitten
    indie-rock boys.  By 1997, when Velocity Girl's once ubiquitous
    <em>Simpatico!</em> had become $1.99 bin fodder, Sarah Shannon found a
    terrific opportunity to reinvent herself, first through the short-lived
    Starry Eyes, and then as a solo artist, releasing one EP on her own
    Marzipan Records.</p><p>
    
    Shannon's self-titled release is produced and co-written by Blake
    Wescott of Pedro the Lion, but don't let that fool you-- there's
    little evidence of mopey folk or Christian theology on this album.
    There are, however, a lot of horns and tons of backing vocals.
    This is not a casual nod toward Bacharach, but a full-on embrace.
    And I guess there's nothing wrong with that.</p><p>
    
    But the lush arrangements, coupled with Shannon's pretty, pitch-perfect
    vocals and polite lyrics are a little too well-behaved for my taste.
    The balmy ""I'll Run Away,"" is true easy listening, without moments
    of sonic deconstruction or ironic distance.  Sure, the piano is lovely,
    and the flugelhorn solos will certainly evoke the pastel-tinted, bubble
    machine theatrics of all your favorite soft-rock radio acts, but folks,
    last time I heard sounds this smooth I was on hold.</p><p>
    
    The bluesy ""That's Mine"" grants the listener a temporary reprieve,
    as one of the only songs on the album with at least a tenuous
    relationship to rock n' roll.  It gives Shannon a chance to cut
    loose, ditch her Starlite Lounge persona and summon a bit of
    emotion. Sadly, she still falls short, but at least it's a good
    effort.</p><p>
    
    The album's true high point comes with ""Live Life Alone,"" which
    sounds like a little-known Gershwin standard.  It's a beautiful song,
    and the arrangement is so dead-on I was temporarily lulled into a
    kind of romantic trance.  Shannon's vocals actually recall Ella
    Fitzgerald.  She hits the high notes like a champ, and I'm inclined
    to advise her to find a great jazz band, or take up musical theater
    (she has that kind of voice).  Which creates a problem-- ""Live Life
    Alone"" could ground a whole album of similarly toned material, or
    even standards. There's nothing wrong with being eclectic, but
    Shannon quickly pulls the listener out of the reverie and into a
    couple more prototypical chamber-pop songs.  The jangly ""Are You Far
    Enough"" could be a Velocity Girl song (though with less punch); the
    early 70s swing of ""Can't You See"" (the album's final track) is tepid,
    at best.</p><p>
    
    So here's the risk. You release an album with one really outstanding
    song, ideally suited to your talents as a vocalist. Your audience may
    be so blown away by your performance of that one track that they
    revise their prior opinions of your artistic strengths.  You have a
    diva moment.  It's cool, but the rest of your material sounds like
    you phoned in your vocals, schlepped out some lyrics, and hoped the
    liberal use of flugelhorn would conceal your ambivalence to the rest
    of the material. </p><p>
    
    I feel sorta bad for Sarah Shannon.  On this album, she reveals what
    she should have been doing all along. And it's not this earnest
    Debby Boone shit-- I'm thinking Shannon could do a mean take on
    the Cole Porter songbook.  Until then, I'll wait patiently for the
    Bacharach regurgitations to end.</p></div>"|7097.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7097-sarah-shannon/|6.0|Alison Fields

I have a feeling they have, but
    I have to admit I haven't been following the trials and tribulations
    of Decatur, Georgia's finest girly-folk duo too closely.  Either way,
    Tara Jane O'Neil and Cynthia Nelson-- better known as Retsin-- seem
    intent on taking over where <em>Swamp Ophelia</em> left off.</p><p>
    
    With this five-song EP, the duo smooth out the experimental
    eccentricities that characterized their privious work, and offer up a
    surprisingly bland dose of Lilith fare.  The sonic depth of O'Neil's
    work with Rodan and the Sonora Pine-- which always seemed to spice up
    Retsin's lo-fi confessional singer-songwriter style-- is likewise
    nowhere to be found here.  Even the lyrical conundrums, which at the
    very least kept things somewhat interesting, are traded for
    forgettable faux-witticisms delivered in a smarmy, sing-songy manner
    that would befit a Lisa Loeb album.</p><p>
    
    ""Pauline and Susie"" is the clear standout on this modest little
    collection.  Presumably a tale of escaping to some relative's house
    during a breakdown, the song's repetitive riff comes off a little too
    cutesy, especially accompanying lines like, ""This time I said yes to
    sedation, oh yes,"" but at least it's memorable.  Unfortunately, the
    same can't be said for the rest of the songs here. They seem feeble,
    meandering, and unfocused by comparison.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Duck Out,"" even with clunky and embarrassing lines like,
    ""Duck out to where we're from...there's no sex in my face,"" wouldn't
    be half bad if there was some kind of interesting musical
    accompaniment.  Then there's the completely dispassionate and
    forgettable instrumental ""The Moon Fickle,"" which suffers a similar
    handicap. ""Money Song,"" a quite banjo and acoustic guitar rambler,
    presumably about the tedium of work, while not bad or annoying, has
    little to distinguish it either lyrically or musically.</p><p>
    
    Okay, okay, so this is just a between-albums effort, and maybe not
    indicative of the duo's future direction. Maybe I'm being a little
    harsh, but hey-- you've got to address this kind of shit before it
    gets out of hand.  Sometimes, an EP like this can provide a
    representative introduction to a band or artist, but if you're
    looking for a good cheap place to start with Retsin, <em>Moon Money
    Moon</em> is definitely not it.</p></div>"|6768.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6768-moon-money-moon-ep/|3.4|Jason Nickey

    throwing his audience a left-handed curveball.  Back in the mid-90s,
    when it seemed safe to assume he was about as popular as he was likely
    to get, Richard Melville Hall followed up his mostly Eurodance-inspired
    <em>Everything Is Wrong</em> with a grunge record, then followed that
    with a disc of film scores and a full-on ambient record under the
    bastard alias Voodoo Child.  So when <em>Play</em> dropped back in '99,
    the oddly infectious mix of scratchy old blues recordings, MIDI
    keyboards and programmed drums seemed like an intriguing development
    in Moby's sound-- but no one dared assume it would <em>become</em> his
    sound. Anyone living within ten miles of a TV or radio pretty much
    knows the story from here.  Idealistic hipster trades actual idealism
    for the 2-D MTV version that-- it turns out-- pays a helluva lot better,
    inadvertently scores two-thirds of commercials produced in the following
    three years, and oh yeah, there's that whole international superstar thing.</p><p>
    
    If the threat of never achieving massive superstardom never frightened
    Moby into fitting his music into a mold, then the actual attainment of
    superstar status has. As a follow-up, <em>18</em> plays it safer than a
    quadruple-condomed fundamentalist Christian at an abstinence rally.
    So, yes, in case you were wondering, <em>18</em> does sound a lot like
    <em>Play</em>-- almost song-for-song, in fact.  But any manager can tell
    you that the best way to achieve commercial success is to Stick With
    What Works.  Here, Moby shows us why he's a star and not a starmaker--
    by actually sampling from the same sources!  Couldn't get enough of
    that chanteuse shrouded in tape hiss who sings, ""Ooh Lordy, troubles
    so hard,"" on that Pentium III commercial?  Well, here's another one
    just like her, singing, ""Lordy, don't leave me all by myself.""  See?
    Different.  For ""In My Heart,"" Moby sets a crackly old gospel singer
    against piano lines that <i>way</i> too closely recall the ones on
    ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters"" (which, by the way, was
    already a mere variation on a Philip Glass piece).</p><p>
    
    There's plenty more to dislike about <em>18</em>, like the monotonous
    thumps of already-dated drum machines, the painfully repetitive
    nature of so many of these sounds, or the simplistic keyboard
    noodling in the background of half these songs.  Or inconsequential
    lyrics like those in the opening track (""People may come together/ And
    people may fall apart/ No one can stop us now/ 'Cause we are all made
    of stars""), or those that serve as the refrain to ""Extreme Ways"" (""Oh
    baby, oh baby, then it fell apart, it fell apart"").  But we're veering
    dangerously close into the realm of personal taste, and I see no reason
    to reduce my argument to aesthetics, when I know that tons of people
    get off on this kind of cheese.  But there's plenty of stuff wrong with
    <em>18</em> that's much harder to debate-- stuff that has nothing whatsoever
    to do with my personal likes and dislikes.</p><p>
    
    For one, <em>18</em> is such a blatantly commercial affair I can't help
    but feel pandered to.  Any pretext of cohesiveness is crushed under the
    heel of A&amp;R;'s blatant attempts to sell this album to as many demographics
    as humanly possible.  There's an indie rock song (""Great Escape,"" featuring
    would-be scenesters Azure Ray doing their best Mimi-from-Low impression),
    a hip-hop song (""Jam for the Ladies,"" featuring Angie Stone and MC Lyte),
    and, worst of all, a weepy adult contemporary-friendly slow jam featuring
    none other than Sinead O'Connor (actual so-sappy-I-fell-off-my-chair-and-broke-my-tailbone-laughing
    lyric: ""The sadness flows like water and washes down the heartache"").</p><p>
    
    Those songs that aren't graced by guest appearances all sound crafted
    from the same mold-- <em>Play</em>-style sampled blues and gospel set
    to the same sort of cornily uplifting ambient soundscapes and basic
    keyboard noodlery Moby's been mucking around with for years-- though
    it sounds less inspired now than ever.  For an album three years in
    the making, <em>18</em> sure does sound like it was tossed together at
    the last minute.  It would seem Moby's artistic growth has been stunted
    by his suddenly packed social schedule.   One gets the feeling from the
    songs on <em>18</em> that Moby's more interested in introducing music
    videos and being unfunny with Winona Ryder on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>
    than he is in making music.</p><p>
    
    The only thing that differs from Moby's former work here are the
    liner notes.  Before <em>Play</em>, Moby had earned a reputation for
    the well-crafted, often persuasive essays he included with each
    album.  He damned cultural conservatism, cigarettes, celebrity and
    fundamentalism, while promoting an agenda of conservation,
    vegetarianism, and animal and prisoner rights.  <em>18</em> has merely
    two essays: one about the difficulty of writing essays and the
    process of creating the album at hand, the other politely suggesting
    that everybody be nice to each other.  Can someone please explain to
    me why, in a time when Moby's voice is louder than ever, and when
    cultural conservatism and fundamentalist dogma aims to destroy what
    few freedoms we as a nation have left, Moby would choose to back down?</p><p>
    
    Maybe MTV built an android Moby with the remarkable ability to look
    cute in Pumas and to pilfer through the real Moby's back catalog and
    rearrange samples.  It seems farfetched, but I'd rather suspend some
    disbelief than deal with the knowledge than such an idealistic guy
    could be so easily corrupted by the system he once seemed to fight
    against.  Everything is wrong, indeed.</p></div>"|5348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5348-18/|2.6|David M. Pecoraro

    exercise in borderline-intellectual unpleasantry and pretentious
    indie-filmmaker posturing.  Conceived as a three-part anthology centering
    on the themes of ""Fiction,"" ""Non-Fiction,"" and ""Autobiography,"" the film
    was stripped of its lengthy third sequence when, depending on who you
    believe, the segment was determined to be redundant and inferior-- or,
    excised at the studio's request when they discovered, to their horror,
    <em>Dawson Creek</em> star James Van Der Beek on the receiving end of
    simulated anal sex.  The completed <em>Storytelling</em> was released
    earlier this year with an anemic 87-minute running time and a ludicrously
    censored interracial sex scene (which placed an enormous crimson rectangle
    not just over the offending areas of adjacent black and white skin, but
    completely obscuring the actors).</p><p>
    
    Two artists were commissioned by Solondz to score the remaining sections
    of <em>Storytelling</em>-- Shudder to Think's Nathan Larson and the Cardigans'
    Nina Persson the ""Fiction"" segment, which concerns a white community-college
    student's fascination with her black writing-class professor, and Belle &amp;
    Sebastian the ""Non-Fiction"" segment, about a second-rate filmmaker's attempts
    to document the life of a completely aimless high school student.  The choice
    of Belle &amp; Sebastian to score a film seemed a coup for Solondz, a tactic
    which backfired when it was widely reported that most of Belle &amp; Sebastian's
    score and several original songs written for the movie simply wouldn't be used.
    The move reportedly incensed both the band and the film's distributor, AOL
    Time Warner subsidiary New Line Cinema, who were counting on a killer soundtrack
    to help sell the film.  <em>Storytelling</em>, predictably, was a critical and
    commercial flop, even among those who really wanted to like the film, with many
    viewing its brevity and heavily censored content as a sorry compromise.</p><p>
    
    Belle &amp; Sebastian's <em>Storytelling</em> is a compromise as well, as this
    schizoid album is clearly divided by what Belle &amp; Sebastian consider a
    soundtrack (<em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em>, <em>The Graduate</em>) and what New
    Line considers a soundtrack (<em>Pulp Fiction</em>, apparently).  Coming in at
    a tidy 38 minutes, <em>Storytelling</em> is a disorienting hodgepodge of new
    songs and instrumental score padded with annoying segments of dialogue from
    the movie.</p><p>
    
    Belle &amp; Sebastian's instrumental score is mostly comprised of variations on
    a theme, in this case the ambling piano loops and soaring strings of ""Fiction.""
    It's a pleasant enough melody, revisited thrice on <em>Storytelling</em>: with
    variations in a minor key on ""Freak,"" with cavernous echo and vibes on ""Night
    Walk,"" and a more propulsive reading with percussion on ""Fiction (Reprise).""
    Different instruments are used to convey particular themes or characters: a
    majestic horn and gentle undulations of harp mark ""Consuelo""; similar
    instrumentation explodes into Latin exotica on the Sergio Mendes-flavored
    ""Consuelo Leaving.""  The lonesome, harmonica-driven ""Fuck This Shit"" floats
    along on a Mancini-inspired river of cheesy 60s strings, despite an unfortunate
    resemblance to the music in Del Taco's late-night commercials (for those of you
    in Western states and, for some reason, Maryland).  The melody is resurrected
    on the jazzy ""Mandingo Cliche,"" which is unfortunately marred by dialogue from
    the film throughout.</p><p>
    
    The six vocal cuts are a grab bag of songs only marginally relevant to the
    film-- ""Storytelling"" and ""Big John Shaft"" seemingly more about Hollywood and
    the process of moviemaking than concerning the Solondz film and its shallow
    conceits.  The twee but extremely catchy title track continues in <em>Fold Your
    Hands, Child</em>'s poppy vein with Schroeder-from-<em>Peanuts</em> piano, flute,
    and horns and Isobel Campbell trading vocals with Stevie Jackson.  Slo-mo funk
    riffs and spacey vibes give ""Big John Shaft""  an infectious, cinematic drive as
    Stuart Murdoch laments a landscape of frustrated screenwriters and typecast
    actors: ""I won't play another heavyweight/ I won't play another Big John Shaft.""
    Jackson's excellent, Spanish-inflected ""Wandering Alone""-- a highlight of Belle
    &amp; Sebastian's 2001 live shows-- is another standout here, though it seemingly
    has little connection with the film or the rest of the album.</p><p>
    
    The other three vocal contributions are less successful, with Murdoch's almost
    a capella ""I Don't Want to Play Football"" barely registering at under 60
    seconds.  The similarly brief ""Scooby Driver,"" scarcely over a minute long,
    is much too boisterous and hyperactive for this otherwise low-key, mid-tempo
    collection. Jackson's fey ""Black and White Unite"" suffers from thin vocals,
    inexplicable references to hiking and cricket, and juvenile stream-of-consciousness
    drivel like, ""They're tearing up the street/ I'm half in love with every girl I
    meet/ The gas man loves the street/ He loves to drill, he loves to think about
    his girl.""</p><p>
    
    So where to stand on a soundtrack that clearly rises above its source
    material, yet fails to gel as a cohesive record on its own merit?
    One wonders why Belle &amp; Sebastian insist on an association with
    <em>Storytelling</em> at all, rather than parceling out their unused
    compositions to better films.  Fans will still consider this album
    worth owning, if only for ""Wandering Alone"" and ""Big John Shaft,"" but
    the lackluster filler and pretty, but generally repetitive, instrumental
    work make <em>Storytelling</em> little more than a six-cut EP with a
    dozen bonus tracks.  The record is barely longer than a sitcom without
    the between-tracks dialogue, which gets pretty tiresome after the first
    listen. However, I don't mind the inclusion of a cheeky dig at Solondz'
    artistic failure at the tail end of ""Fiction (Reprise).""  ""I'm so, so
    sorry,"" mutters the filmmaker played by Paul Giamatti to the stoner
    lampooned in his documentary.  ""Don't be,"" comes the reply. ""Your
    movie's a hit.""</p></div>"|629.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/629-storytelling/|6.5|Will Bryant

    hit the top of my review pile about a year too late.  There was a
    time when I was crazy in the coconut for the kind of sky-blue sundress
    pop the band peddles, scooping up anything with the serpentine Elephant
    6 logo or by a band whose name could have been lifted from the lyrics
    to ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite.""  At their best, these acts
    seemed to tap into the unrealized potential of late 60s sing-along
    psychedelia, and the possibilities seemed endless.</p><p>
    
    Well, endless ain't what it used to be, and unless I'm just getting
    cynical (a reasonable possibility) anything the Beach Boys and
    Beatles didn't get a chance to say may now have been officially
    said.  Elephant 6 is in shambles: Olivia Tremor Control has split
    into two inferior entities; Apples in Stereo has attained their
    lifelong goal of becoming cartoons; Jeff Mangum is a drug casualty
    with follow-up fear.  But that doesn't matter to labels like Kindercore
    who continue pumping out competent but unexceptional collections of
    catchy, sunny tunes.</p><p>
    
    Take <em>Protest a Dark Anniversary</em>, for example, an album that's
    far from terrible, even fairly enjoyable at times, but an album with
    absolutely nothing to separate it from the rest of the worker ants in
    the pop music colony.  This appraisal is supported by the number of
    ""element x sounds like band y"" statements I can construct from the
    eleven songs within, in time-honored lazy critic fashion.  For
    example, singer Sean Rawls sounds a heckuva lot like Matthew Sweet
    with a weaker high range, while other singer Brendan Mead could be
    Kevin Barnes on a low-sugar diet.  The flute solo of ""Anything,
    Anything"" is reminiscent of the Essex Green, and the brass section
    of ""Take Time"" harvests the same thin, reedy sound of Elf Power
    hornwork.  And so on.</p><p>
    
    If you're keeping score at home, you'll notice that all the above
    influences are themselves artists proudly sporting late 60s
    sensibilities, suggesting (correctly) that Masters of the Hemisphere
    are a further dilution of the original inspirations.  Despite the
    cocky name and intriguingly mysterious album title, the quartet's
    mood rarely varies from starry-eyed romanticism-- to paraphrase
    Phillip Seymour Hoffman impersonating Lester Bangs, there's
    absolutely nothing controversial about them.  We're talking
    irritatingly gauzy songs about girls named Diane and Jenny, a song in
    waltz time about waltzing (""Sailboat Kite""), and positive-thinking
    slogans like ""Everybody's writing songs/ In hopes that you might sing
    along.""</p><p>
    
    But I'll reiterate that MOTH (cool acronym, at least) have a knack
    for melody, even if the songs stick about as well as secondhand
    scotch tape.  In the battle of the two frontmen, Mead's songs tend to
    stand out, if only because he's not afraid to use a couple minor
    chords on ""Rules of Life"" and ""Local Government.""  ""In the Morning""
    lingers amongst the short-term memory centers a little longer, thanks
    to a jumpy bass line that almost-- <em>almost</em>-- gives the band a
    little backbone to work with.</p><p>
    
    These occasional ventures into above-average range make me feel a
    little guilty about using their album as a platform for my State of
    the Pop World Address, but the fat part of the bell curve majority of
    <em>Protest a Dark Anniversary</em> models the flaws of the genre all
    too well.  Overly familiar and comfortable staying along the beaten
    path, it's the kind of record that serves primarily as a comparison
    point by which truly great, boundary-expanding pop works are judged.
    Consider it a teaching tool for those looking to start the next
    tambourines-and-Rickenbacker band: find a fresh and unique element
    to add to the mix, or face the collective shrug of pedantic hipsters
    like myself.</p></div>"|5138.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5138-protest-a-dark-anniversary/|5.0|Rob Mitchum

    and electro are the two flavors experiencing the strongest resurgence
    right now.  Shoegazers have been pining for a new My Bloody Valentine
    album for the last ten years, even though the sound has never really
    gone away.  Post-punk and electro come from roughly the same late-70s
    to early-80s time frame, so maybe shoegazer needs the crit-mandated
    two-decade span to rally behind a <em>Loveless</em> for the next
    generation.  In the meantime, labels like Clairecords and Darla have
    been releasing a steady stream of paeans to pop noise. Darla's <em>Bliss
    Out</em> series, in particular, has been a vehicle for some high-quality
    excursions in fuzzy ambience.</p><p>
<em>...Or You Could Just Go Through Your Whole Life and Be Happy
    Anyway</em>, the eighteenth volume of <em>Bliss Out</em>, is an
    essential release in the series, and it conjures all the appropriate
    environments: a wintry atmosphere, snow softly falling, the scene
    mirrored in the water as you watch from the lakeside hearth of your
    home.  As Aarktica, Jon De Rosa programs melancholy dream-pop infused
    with layers of strings and shifting electronic beats.  He's studied
    composition at NYU with Kenneth Valitsky, a former student of
    Stockhausen, and now does graduate work in the psychology of music.
    De Rosa's structural skills are reflected in these seven tracks,
    which play out with orchestral swells and symphonic attention to
    tone, but never come across as ornate or stuffy.  The production
    blurs the elements together, touching on the dullness of the hibernal
    season, instead of just the glitter of the holidays.</p><p>
    
    ""Aura Lee"" builds from thrummed guitars and the pristine whish of a
    drum machine's hi-hat into one constant, rolling crescendo of timpani
    rumbling and backing vocals from Mahogany's Lorraine Lelis.  De
    Rosa's got the voice you'd expect, soft and breathy-- somewhere
    between a sigh and a moan.  His lyrics invite intimacy: ""In winter
    time, to keep us warm/ I'll show you how the snow can harbor us from
    harm/ Trust will grow in blinding cold/ Double footsteps line the path
    toward growing old.""  The chorus, ""sing to me, Aura Lee,"" would turn
    the title into a pun if the song wasn't so transcendent-- the
    ethereal romanticism is like an alternate-universe twist on ""Manic
    Depression,"" in which the artist can finally caress and kiss the
    music.</p><p>
    
    These surreal moments of aural contact occur throughout: ""You're
    Landlocked, My Love"" traps you in a field of constantly shifting
    beats flickering violently between stereo channels.  De Rosa's pulled
    an impressive trick here, placing what is essentially a folk ballad
    down amongst the electric mayhem.  At the end even his own slow tone
    poem gets caught in the whirling textures, fading into a foghorn's
    groan, then cut up and pasted in abrupt, jarring passages.  On the
    other bank, ""Happy Again"" finds you laid back against the shore and
    lazily tossing stones into a glassy pond.  Each sublime guitar peal
    ripples outwards, echoing until time lapses, while the ebbing feedback
    drones on.</p><p>
    
    After the ambient stretches, De Rosa caps off the record in a more
    pop direction.  ""Nostalgia = Distortion"" sets up a downtempo groove
    as De Rosa sings, ""I can watch you for hours fishing your skull.""  You
    barely notice the transition to its companion piece, ""The Hook, the
    Reel, and the Pull,"" four minutes of Cure'd reverb.  The handclaps
    and the bell tolling on ""Song for a Free Williamsburg"" seem absurd at
    first, but the dance vibe moves even further towards delicious
    darkwave.  De Rosa's vocals melt into different shades as the beats
    multiply.</p><p>
    
    The progressions in these forty-one minutes remind me of the Flying
    Saucer Attack songs that Matt Elliott worked on, as well as Amp's
    organic textures.  The consistency of the music here creates a world
    unto its own.  It'll churn in any season, like a snow globe.</p></div>"|7.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7-or-you-could-just-go-through-your-whole-life-and-be-happy-anyway/|8.1|Christopher Dare

    underground analogue to a producer's album a la N.E.R.D. except with fewer
    vocals, and far less studio polish.  Like the Neptunes, Jel is a high-demand
    fellow, a bedrock for that shapeless mass of Anticon MCs.  With this album,
    though, Jel bucks innovation and gives a hefty, rustic shout-out to producers
    of yore. And what easier way to pay one's respects than to use their equipment?</p><p>
    
    The concept on <em>10 Seconds</em> revolves around a sampler: the classic E-Mu
    Systems SP-1200. The title refers to the limited sampling time of the SP-1200
    (every cut had to be 10 seconds or less-- usually less), precluding most
    P. Diddy-style ""whole song"" ripoffs.  Limited sampling time was one feature
    that lent to the SP's distinctive sound.  The other was the SP-1200's low-tech
    construction: limited by 12-bits of sampling power, SP beats were uniformly
    dank, dirty and rough-hewn-- a grittiness that appealed to producers looking
    for a little more snarl in their funk.  The cast of SP disciples who fell in
    love with the machine is illustrious: Mantronix, Marley Marl, Large Professor,
    Ced Gee, the Bomb Squad and the Beastie Boys, just to name a few.</p><p>
    
    Given the aforementioned lineup of hip-hop all-stars, making an album in tribute
    to their equipment could be disastrous. At its worst, it would approximate
    handing B.B. King's ""Lucille"" to Extreme's Nuno Bettencourt.  Or giving Van
    Halen's mic to Extreme's Gary Cherone. Or really, just about anything involving
    decent music exchanged with elements of the instrument-endorsing blowhards
    responsible for ""More Than Words.""  Luckily, Jel manages to avoid such ignominy.
    Rather, he does a nice job, tweaking some authentic growl out of the SP, and
    adding some flavor of his own.</p><p>
    
    Jel never departs from funky beats-- no matter what the sample or mood, the beat
    remains, and it's usually fairly straightforward, using standard funk basslines
    and hyper-syncopated drumbeats.  On the other hand, they can also be quite
    stagnant-- rarely do you hear many rhythm changes or interludes.  Instead, most
    of the flavor comes from authentic samples, scratches, and drums. As a result,
    the consistent patterns can wear a little thin. A good example is ""Channel
    Assign,"" which vamps on a reverbed two-chord organ riff while a nice,
    hollow-sounding drum beat pumps underneath. The beat is fresh, but the track
    clocks in at about four minutes, with little other than the organ riff dropping
    in and out to keep it interesting.</p><p>
    
    ""Special,"" on the other hand, is the record's highlight.  It includes Jel's
    finest sample work, grounding the beat in a Bob Marley groove, while adding
    some ambient crowd noise, what sounds like an electric oboe, and the requisite
    scratched-up old-skool MC verse.  Although <em>10 Seconds</em> doesn't break much
    new ground, it is a good disc, true to Jel's concept and very listenable. Like
    most of the SP's work-product, <em>10 Seconds</em> sounds like old, undiscovered
    vinyl-- with plenty of funk, crackle, and pop.</p></div>"|4232.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4232-10-seconds/|6.9|Brad Haywood

    There is a law that says all reviews of Antibalas records must
    contain the above statement. And it's true-- this 16-piece Brooklyn
    collective owes a hell of a lot to the Nigerian bandleader and
    rabble-rouser, as they're the first to admit.  They owe so much to
    his sound, in fact, that even people who bought the 2xCD <em>Best of
    Fela Kuti</em> at Starbucks two months ago are allowed to feel outrage
    at the level of mimicry on the band's second album, <em>Talkatif</em>.
    Even though these 16 musicians live and breathe Fela Kuti's music and
    have devoted their lives to spreading the joy that comes from sharply
    arranged and performed afrobeat, the punters will not stand for this
    wholesale appropriation of style.  Down with Antibalas!  Fela Forever!</p><p>
    
    Did I just say ""punters""?  Anyway, with that rant out of the way,
    let's say, just for argument's sake, that you're not really concerned
    with the integrity of the recorded legacy of Fela Kuti, and are
    instead curious about whether or not this here <em>Talkatif</em> album
    has some good music on it. I know, I know, you're actually seething
    over this aping of the Fela catalog, almost as bad as the number Bill
    Laswell pulled on <i>Army Arrangement</i>, but I'm going to answer this
    question anyway, just as a rhetorical exercise. It'll be fun.</p><p>
    
    Setting aside all issues of originality, I am here to report that
    <em>Talkatif</em> is a good album, though not a great one. First the
    'good' parts: the arrangements on these seven tracks are exceptional.
    This unwieldy mass of trumpets, saxophones, organs, guitars, bass and
    drums, drums, drums seriously chug along as a unified music machine,
    each part working together and yet remaining separate enough to be
    heard and appreciated on its own. With everything going on
    simultaneously-- and it's quite a lot-- the music never seems crowded
    or muddy.  The compositions are also up to snuff.  Each track is
    built from a bass and percussion vamp; riffs and rhythm are far more
    important than melody.  On most tracks the beat is introduced, a few
    horns will solo on the theme, the organ might take over for a bit,
    next comes a percussion break, then a restatement and time to back
    out.  A couple of numbers also engage in shouted call-and-response
    vocals, which lack urgency but somehow manage to work well as
    songs.</p><p>
    
    Now on to the not-so-great: first, I have an image in my mind of
    Antibalas as an energetic live band, and much of <em>Talkatif</em>
    seems more restrained and polite than it probably ought to. While
    the tracks are marginally propulsive, there's a lack of fire to the
    music, like they were more concerned with sounding good than cutting
    loose. This has the odd side effect of helping Antibalas fit in at
    Ninja Tune, as this record seems made more for background music or
    head-nodding than for a real dance party.  Along the same lines,
    the seven tracks here run just over 40 minutes, which seems a little
    short for the afrobeat form. With this music's semi-improvisatory
    nature and focus on the beat, long, drawn-out tunes that develop over
    time would be more appropriate.  A ""Live at the Great American Music
    Hall"" follow-up could be just the thing to follow <em>Talkatif</em>.
    Still, for what it is, this isn't bad.  Get yourself some Fela or
    pick up Antibalas, I don't give a damn.</p></div>"|212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/212-talkatif/|6.8|Mark Richard-San

    hearing something about Versus.  But now, Baluyut's ready to shut everyone up in
    fine style and just maybe get you to stop reminiscing about his full-time band
    for five goddamn minutes.  Now listen closely, 'cause I'm only gonna say this
    once: Baluyut sets out solo for this effort as +/-, and if you were expecting
    pop, you got it, but this ain't exactly your daddy's <i>Secret Swingers</i>.
    Instead, Baluyut marries deliciously hott digital manipulation and Mille
    Plateaux beats to the upbeat, joyous pop songwriting that made him such a
    staple of the 90s college-rock circuit.</p><p>
    
    Baluyut's recipe here is straightforward enough: take simple acoustic pop
    sensibilities with warm electronic swells and undertones; add tight, complex
    percussion and distant vocal arrangements.  But it's the small changes of focus
    between seemingly disparate elements that make <i>Self-Titled Long-Playing Debut
    Album</i> exceptionally varied.  Each song is a subtle shift from the previous
    one as new elements continually rise to the fore and old ones are subdued or
    eliminated.  And of course, it's all occasionally punctuated by startling
    bursts of white noise and alien effects.  Yet despite its experimental nature,
    the pop song always remains the focus, drenched in perfect melody.</p><p>
    
    Even at its most jarring (which, to be fair, isn't very), <i>Debut Album</i>
    has a nice underlying tranquility.  Synth chords mimic strings and sweep in
    over the opener, ""All I Do,"" constantly building but never finally breaking,
    over Baluyut's lone, plaintive refrain.  ""Manifest Destiny (In General)""
    instantly distinguishes itself with a cascading, slightly dissonant piano
    melody and bouts of invading instrumentation before Baluyut is brought so
    close it feels as though he's singing from within the deepest recesses of
    your brain.  In fact, it's at this moment that you realize Baluyut's vocals
    are <i>Debut Album</i>'s single greatest asset.  The thread that ties the
    record together, his lilting tenor is part lullaby, part lament, mournful and
    sleepy, conveying a genuine sense of conviction.</p><p>
    
    This record fits nicely into the canon of so-called ""digipop,"" amongst releases
    like Notwist's <i>Neon Golden</i> and Hood's <i>Cold House</i>, but its artistic
    debts are owed to the Magnetic Fields' synth-crazy oeuvre.  And while not
    perfect-- the vocal loop on ""Yo Yo Yo (Please Don't Fall in Love)"" is pretty
    upsetting-- its missteps are few and far between.  The only real issue I take
    with <i>Self-Titled Long-Playing Debut Album</i>, is that it's a bit too
    removed at times.  Some of these songs could benefit from a little intimacy,
    which is admittedly difficult to pull off in this kind of setting.  But all
    told, this is an interesting direction for Baluyut that pays off more than it
    flounders.  And with the advances recently made by digital editing software,
    his self-titled long-playing sophomore album stands to be just as rewarding.</p></div>"|6354.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6354-self-titled-long-playing-debut-album/|8.4|Eric Carr

    out? Why the hell else do you exist?</p><p>
    
    Operator 1: Sir, try to calm down.  I can hear that you're frustrated.</p><p>
    
    Caller: Of <i>course</i> I'm frustrated! Duh! You would be too!</p><p>
    
    Operator 1: But sir, I didn't call the Crisis Hotline tonight. Let's not
    make this about me.</p><p>
<i>[The caller's response here is unintelligible except for what sounds
    like the words ""shenanigan ass"" and ""Robyn Hitchcock.""]</i></p><p>
    
    Operator 1: Breathe, sir. Try to breathe. How about I count and you inhale
    and exhale along with my counting?</p><p>
    
    Caller: I don't think you're taking this threat seriously enough.  Have
    you considered what would happen if this double CD were left in a time
    capsule, and the rest of the world was destroyed in a war over oil so
    people could drive to their tanning beds and botox injections, and this
    thing was all that was left of Bob Dylan's legacy after the destruction?</p><p>
<i>[Operator 1 was silent here. She reported to her supervisor that she
    did not know what to say.]</i></p><p>
    
    Caller: Hello, operator?  Jesus!  Think about it!  Anyone who heard
    these sixteen covers and thought they had heard Dylan-- that would
    be like thinking you'd seen some painter's masterpiece because you
    saw a postcard of it!  The crap-recorded acoustic guitar on the first
    disc must be being strummed by a mannequin!</p><p>
<i>[At this point, Operator 1 believed that the Caller had begun talking
    to someone else in his proximity. On the tape, he evidently told someone
    to ""go away,"" because ""Daddy's putting up special shelves.""]</i></p><p>
    
    Operator 1:  Sir, are you still there?</p><p>
    
    Caller:  Yeah. Kids these days, huh?</p><p>
    
    Operator 1:  They're something.</p><p>
    
    Caller:  They really are. So, are you getting it yet?</p><p>
    
    Operator 1:  What I'm hearing is that you think someone's going to try to trap
    Bob Dylan in a capsule.</p><p>
    
    Caller:  That's not what I said at all.  Do you even listen to Bob Dylan?</p><p>
    
    Operator 1:  No, sir.</p><p>
    
    Caller:  Who do you listen to?</p><p>
    
    Operator 1:  Country.  Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson...</p><p>
    
    Caller:  Hell, you wouldn't know country if it served you under a
    heat lamp in an All-U-Can-Eat buffet.  Get me somebody else.  I will
    burn this house down if you don't connect me with someone who knows
    who Bob Dylan and Robyn Hitchcock are!</p><p>
<i>[Operator 1 patched the Caller through to Operator 2, who claimed
    familiarity with whatever the Caller was talking about. The tape
    didn't pick up until mid-conversation.]</i></p><p>
    
    Operator 2:   I thought the liner notes were only mildly
    self-indulgent and even kind of charming. Especially when Hitchcock
    compared Dylan to Monty Python's reluctant messiah Brian, and when he
    wrote about how, the first time he heard ""Desolation Row,"" he thought
    Dylan was saying ""Destination Roll.""</p><p>
    
    Caller: Yeah, but the song-order listing on the first CD is screwed up!
    Just by the time ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"" came on, I wanted the
    coffeehouse proprietor to interrupt and say for him to give someone
    else a chance at open mic night.</p><p>
    
    Operator 2: Sir, Hitchcock doesn't purport to be trying to 'interpret'
    Dylan's songs.  I think it was a very cool gesture, to a mentor.
    Hitchcock is saying 'thank you' to Dylan, in a way.</p><p>
    
    Caller:  I don't know, man.  His restagings are as hackneyed as Gus Van
    Sant's <em>Psycho</em>!  He totally botches ""4th Time Around""!  I didn't
    pay for two damn blooper CDs!</p><p>
    
    Operator 2: I find the full-band rendition of ""Visions of Johanna""
    really powerful, the way they soft-produced it for that retro feel.
    And the acoustic versions of the two more recent Dylan songs, the
    nihilist ""Not Dark Yet"" and the humanist ""Dignity,"" hold up beside
    obvious jukebox fare like ""Tangled Up in Blue.""</p><p>
    
    Caller: But that breathy vocal inflection for 'important' or
    'intense' lines strikes me as <i>so</i> fake.  He sounds like Willow
    marveling at Madmartigan!  There's some murky quantity, some
    American idiom, missing.  The same way Americans make goons of
    themselves doing Shakespeare, he makes a goon of himself doing
    Dylan.  Hitchcock misses the spontaneity of Dylan's enunciation and
    forces a predictable pattern on the lyrical rhythm.  His version of
    the whitey-blues swagger of ""Leopard-Skin Pillbox Hat"" is straight-up
    square!</p><p>
    
    Operator 2: Sir, do you fancy yourself an amateur rock critic?</p><p>
    
    Caller: What does that even mean?  Is there any such a thing as a
    'professional' rock critic, whom lawyers can summon to testify in
    cases?  'We need an official diagnosis of <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em>,
    quick!  Help, we don't know what to think about <em>The Soft Bulletin</em>!'
    Fuck!</p><p>
    
    Operator 2: I was just saying that you might try listening to
    Hitchcock's earlier work solo, and his two bands.</p><p>
    
    Caller: Yeah, there's good stuff, but he's second-tier next to Dylan,
    right?  He's like Pepsi, or K-Mart. </p><p>
    
    Operator 2: Try to focus on something positive, sir.</p><p>
    
    Caller: Okay, okay. Disc two is pretty good, the one where he re-enacts
    the Royal Albert Hall/'Judas' concert. Some of that stuff's top-notch
    homage, actually.  High energy.  He cusses well on that raucous ""Ballad
    of a Thin Man.""  The band rips up ""I Don't Believe You"" and ""Just Like
    Tom Thumb's Blues.""  And Hitchcock works himself into an inspired,
    endearing, middle-age rage on disc two.  I love <i>some</i> of it,
    I think.</p><p>
    
    Operator 2: That CD came out a long time ago as a promo called
    <em>Beautiful Queen.</em></p><p>
    
    Caller: What a stupid thing to know. What I was saying was, the best
    stuff on these discs only increases the sting of the lame stuff. And
    what England-covers-America album do my kids have to look forward to
    in 2025, if there is a 2025?  Liam Gallagher doing Beck?</p><p>

You'd think that's a bit of a no-brainer for someone
    like me-- I've been writing music reviews for a year now, own
    thousands of albums and just completed four years at a music
    college.  But when you're surrounded by something you love, it can
    be easy to forget just how important it is to you.  Absence makes the
    heart grow fonder, as they say.</p><p>
    
    This past week, I haven't had much of a chance to listen to music.
    Between finishing up classes, attending graduation, giving time to
    my visiting family and frantically searching with a friend for an
    apartment that didn't seem to be materializing, my stereo and I
    didn't get a whole lot of quality time together.  Even now, my
    computer and stereo are sitting packed in boxes, in limbo at my
    parents' house, waiting to be moved again.</p><p>
    
    Of course, now that the blur of airports, trains, mortarboards and
    landlords who never called us back that was this last week is finally
    over, I've got some time on my hands.  So here I am at my parents'
    computer, finally getting a chance to spend a couple of hours with
    some new music.  My deadline for Pitchfork notwithstanding, it's like
    Heaven-- and it reminds me of just why music is such a big part of
    my life.</p><p>
    
    Maybe it's just a coincidence that the CD I'm reviewing now perfectly
    suits my mood.  Slow, beautiful and contemplative, the debut from
    Charles Kim's Sinister Luck Ensemble couldn't be a more perfect
    soundtrack for my state of mind if it had been improvised to a video
    of my brainwaves.  Some of you may be familiar with Kim's work with
    Pinetop Seven-- he was responsible for the instrumental interludes
    that dotted their albums and played foil to Darren Richard's
    narratives of warped Americana.</p><p>
    
    Striking out on his own with some of the Midwest's finest players in
    tow, he makes it clear that his Pinetop Seven contributions were just
    a tiny glimpse at the landscape of sounds that exist in his head.
    <em>Anniversary</em> opens with the title track, a brief statement from
    Rob Mazurek's muted trumpet designed to prick up the goose bumps on
    your arms, no matter how warm it is.  From there, Kim &amp; Co. bring on
    the night like nobody's business, effortlessly sliding through almost
    an hour of arresting, nocturnal music. </p><p>
    
    Kim's steel guitar soars over Robert Cruz's accordion and Glenn
    Kotche's restrained drumming on ""Deep Ellum,"" recalling Friends of
    Dean Martinez at their most majestic, while it mixes perfectly with
    Andrew Bird's violin on the effervescent, sepia-toned ""What Holds
    Them Above.""  Kim turns to the melodica for the album's gorgeous
    closer, ""This Will All Be Yours,"" intertwining his playing with
    Diana Parmeter's softly moaning cello to great effect.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Ken Vandermark's clarinets battle Kim's reverb-soaked
    guitars for dominance on ""The Black Pool,"" easily the album's most
    sonically challenging track.  Though much of the music here rests
    near the line between freedom and structure, this song is one of
    the few that actually crosses that line, with controlled waves of
    swelling noise.  Possibly the album's finest song, though, is ""Spit
    in the Well,"" a stirring waltz featuring Andrew Bird's commanding
    violin and thoughtful counterpoint from Parmeter and double-bassist
    Kent Kessler.</p><p>
    
    For those of you who're multimedia inclined, <em>Anniversary</em>
    contains a Quicktime movie for ""Cakewalk,"" prepared by Jeff Economy,
    whose films with Carolyn Faber provided the basis for half of
    Califone's <em>Deceleration One</em>.  As Mazurek's trumpet blares in
    the foreground, you're treated to some grainy footage of snow-covered
    streets, a lighthouse in a storm and a man operating a cement mixer,
    all sped up in odd contrast with the music.</p><p>
    
    It's hard to slap any kind of label on music like this.  Calling it
    post-rockin'-folk-Americana or some other compound hyphenate could
    never really do it any type of justice, so let's just say that it's
    gorgeous, emotional instrumental music that's perfectly tailored for
    those times after the sunset when you need to bring your blood
    pressure down a few points. Rest assured, when I finally do get into
    that new apartment, this disc will be coloring a lot of my nights.</p></div>"|7186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7186-anniversary/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    it's been haunting them ever since.  How could their whirlwind,
    vibraphone-driven post-rock get stuck in the background?  Shouldn't
    it at least be distracting?  As they finished their second
    full-length, <em>Sugar</em>, bassist Matthew Gengler wrote on their
    website: ""This year I'm pushing for more 'anthemic pelvic rockers'
    and fewer 'heartfelt ballads.'""</p><p>
    
    And sure enough, after an attention-getting percussion intro,
    <em>Sugar</em> leaps into a song that pins your ears back like an
    extreme rollercoaster.  ""They See Rocks"" vaults through its chord
    changes on Gengler's moon-walking bass and the one-man massacre of
    Cale Parks on drums.  It has the lurching, exhilarating feel of
    Aloha's first albums, but this time the arrangement is bigger:
    Eric Koltnow's signature vibraphone mixes with electric piano and
    distorted guitar into molten rock candy.</p><p>
    
    It's their loudest album, but the band still sound like music geeks:
    they favor pulsing rhythms to rock beats, and ""It Won't Be Long"" even
    echoes Steve Reich.  On other tunes, they finally sound as jazzy as
    they've always threatened to be-- specifically, they're reminiscent
    of 70s fusion, with its driving rhythms and vague sense of conservatory
    educations.  You can picture the dusty vinyl in their collections by
    bands like Weather Report and Eberhard Weber's Colours.</p><p>
    
    They're not the first post-rock band to be serious instrumentalists,
    but they keep their chops in line by focusing on the songwriting.
    The mini-epic ""Let Your Head Hang Low"" and the exotic segues of
    ""Thieves All Around Us"" both fit inside five minutes, and the
    disturbingly titled ""Balling Phase"" may be their most ecstatic anthem
    yet.  Tony Cavallario is also gaining confidence as a singer: his
    vocals are clearer and louder in the mix, but he's still earnest and
    direct, making sure he earns every high note and big chorus.</p><p>
    
    Where their earlier songs were sometimes fragmentary, the material on
    <em>Sugar</em> is better developed, as each composition hold its own
    under independent scrutiny.  As before, Aloha edits the songs
    together into continuous blocks of music, to replicate their live
    shows.  However, this aspect also makes <em>Sugar</em> less fun than
    their last album, <em>That's Your Fire</em>, where the fast and slow
    songs hurtled into each other and shorter pieces of tunes ran into
    sprawling textural epics.  To some listeners it sounded cobbled
    together, but to others, <em>That's Your Fire</em> was one of the
    more inspired post-rock albums of the past few years.</p><p>
<em>Sugar</em> needs more of that variety.  Aloha throws everything they
    have-- their biggest arrangements and most belted-out lyrics-- at
    almost every song on the album.  Near the end, ""Dissolving"" and ""I
    Wish No Chains Upon You"" each sound like just more anthemic bricks in
    the wall: either the band or the listener feels a little tapped.  And
    <em>Sugar</em> could use more of the slow, spare tunes that Aloha was
    known for: in fact, the one thing this album truly lacks is one of
    the trademark, vaguely sappy ballads that the band is obviously
    trying to avoid.  They might have been worried about getting
    typecast, but earlier songs like ""Roanoke Born"" and ""Saint Lorraine""
    were-- and there's nothing wrong with it-- really fucking pretty.
    One or two of these per album won't make anyone think they're soft.
    Besides, I can't study over all this racket!</p></div>"|128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/128-sugar/|8.0|Chris Dahlen

    sound a great deal like his influences, his music will often stand or
    fall on the quality of those influences. If the influences are deemed
    credible and prudent, the music produced in the wake of them will
    stand, unless: 1) it is a cheap ripoff; 2) a commercialized update;
    3) shitty. Examples of influences that generally enjoy deference
    include the Beatles, Can, and the Velvet Underground.</p><p>
    
    Other influences, should they surface in a modern artist's music,
    must be subjected to more rigid scrutiny. These are artists whose
    aggregate work product amounts to two good songs on a box set, or one
    on a greatest hits compilation. These are the fads, six-hit wonders,
    and bygone anachronisms from the pop-rock of old. Most never recorded
    any decent music in the first place, and the very fact that an artist
    actually knows their full catalog nearly sounds the death knell by
    itself. Examples of influences subjected to strict scrutiny criticism
    include the Grateful Dead and Aerosmith.  Instances in which evidence
    of these influences will stand are rare, but they do exist. For
    example, an apparent Duran Duran influence may survive a Pitchfork
    review if it is stunningly ironic.</p><p>
    
    You can squint until your eyes are shut, but you just won't find the
    irony in Knotworking.  Edward Gorch, lead singer and songwriter of
    the Albany, NY folk-pop outfit, has chosen for himself without a
    doubt one of the most irredeemable and least advisable influences in
    the history of rock and roll.  For as popular as Cat Stevens was in
    his heyday, it seems that, in modern times, he's about as relevant as
    an abacus. His music, while a staple for weed-loving audiences in the
    70's, has thus far managed to evade any influence on younger
    weed-loving generations.  And Gorch has clearly listened to several
    albums by Allah's chosen pop icon. Unfortunately, his choice of
    influences also means that, as a matter of rote Pitchfork
    constitutionalism, he was doomed from the outset: the voice and
    lyrical melodrama are straight from the Cat himself.  Moreover, since
    Gorch obviously doesn't have the same sort of production budget at
    his disposal, the orchestration and musicianship are relatively
    simple, leading not only to average music, but <em>consistently</em>
    average music. </p><p>
    
    It's really a hard presumption for Gorch to overcome. He tries--
    ""Imbecile Smile"" is solid proof that the man isn't without talent of
    his own. But even then, the power of the song is drawn solely from a
    crescendo of instrumental dissonance, not from the strength of the
    melody. ""Lawn Plastic Santa,"" on the other hand, has a decent guitar
    hook and vocal melody, but employs dreadful song structure, repeating
    the same verse-chorus-bridge pattern over and over a good five or six
    times.  As for the aforementioned Stevens idolatry, the pinnacle
    comes on ""Manuel,"" where Gorch's voice fully morphs into Cat's
    trademark whinny.</p><p>
    
    In the end, Gorch offers little to redeem his choice of influences.
    Yes, he puts his own folksy downtempo spin on things, but when you're
    dealing with shitty music, simply slowing it down isn't a huge
    improvement. Accordingly, this album must be found wanting. In the
    future, Gorch would do well to stock up on indie-approved influences
    like Nick Drake and Tom Waits, because the current formula is
    definitely ""knotworking.""</p></div>"|4499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4499-notes-left-out/|4.4|Brad Haywood

    completely new music.  I made the not-terribly-deep insight that one
    of the reasons some people might not like a lot of the noisier
    experimental music was because it was intimidating.  In reality, I
    was describing my own experiences regarding some of the music I now
    take for granted as standard 'noise.'  I doubt that most people are
    scared of this stuff.  ""They're afraid of our music"" is a standard
    cop-out for an artist to excuse the fact nobody is latching onto his
    or her sound, though just as often it's a matter of the music simply
    not appealing to listeners' tastes.  Not that anyone cowers in a
    corner with a watchful eye on their stereo, but maybe there's
    sometimes an aspect of fear that goes along with music that doesn't
    immediately relate to something with which we're already familiar.</p><p>
    
    The example I used in the conversation was when I heard the
    self-titled Clash album in high school.  It was so aggressive,
    furious and assured.  There was nowhere for me to breathe, and I had
    never heard anything that raged with the kind of brute force and
    focused sense of purpose that record seemed to possess.  It wasn't
    until six months later, when I revisited the record, that I was able
    to listen without being put off by the sheer intensity of it.  I
    could use the same scenario to describe my first encounters with
    Boredoms, John Zorn and the music on this CD.  In each case, there
    was the initial shock and subtle intimidation, an extended
    separation, and then a return when my senses had almost caught up
    with the experience. Strange that fear would lead to discovery.</p><p>
    
    Filament is an extreme project, and one that I'm not sure what to
    make of yet.  Comprised of full-time experimentalists Otomo Yoshihide
    and Sachiko M., the duo makes minimalist noise via sampler, turntable
    and sine wave.  Both of these musicians have been involved with
    boisterous 'Japanoise' (most notably with Ground Zero, and solo), and
    the usual fare of electronic mayhem and jazz-core extremities
    expected from experimentalists out of Tokyo in the last decade or so.
    What hasn't been expected is their gradual shift from destructive
    cacophony to lengthy, high-pitched sequences.  They still go for your
    ears, but with a laser beam instead of a club.</p><p>
    
    Otomo and Sachiko (who work in similar, if more percussive, realms
    with I.S.O.) describe Filament as a project wherein sound is a
    massive texture, which they knead together from the dough of their
    very minimal equipment.  Okay, you want to know what it sounds like?
    Leave your computer on for about a week, until it starts humming from
    exhaustion, and then place a mic up to the hard drive.  Turn your amp
    up to 10, and then subject yourself to the feedback and computer hum
    for about half an hour.  Trust me, you won't have to strain to hear
    it.  The devastating frequencies will more likely cause your dogs to
    go berserk, and yourself to either develop a terrible migraine, or
    kneel in submission.</p><p>
    
    If you listen in a bit, there are variations at work.  Otomo's
    sampler interrupts the pure resonance of the sine wave, ofter
    producing the effect of a very light generator hum, or even glitchy
    tick-beats-- just dox92t expect anything close to rhythm.  Also, since
    <em>29092000</em> (Filament's third release) is a document of a concert
    hall performance, there is an omnipresent room ambience.  This may
    not seem like much, but if live sine wave and sampler effects is the
    Spartan music of the future, then purely studio-based sine waves is
    the music of digital hell.</p><p>
    
    And so, the question becomes: is this interesting new music, or a
    physically painful display of artists looking for the next plateau of
    extreme noise?  The answer may very well reside in your threshold for
    pain-- not to mention your ideas about what actually constitutes
    music.  Filament is but one of several current electronic outfits all
    over the world who are already very far away from both relatively
    experimental IDM and established, academic electro-acoustic music.
    They certainly aren't for anyone impatient or the slightest bit wary
    of experimental electronic music.  If that doesn't scare you away,
    they could be onto something.</p></div>"|3056.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3056-29092000/|7.0|Dominique Leone

Whether he knows it or not, Apple-Jack's G4 has become the premiere
    production device for any pseudo-boardsman, giving work to meatheads with even the narrowest of ProTools
    prowess.  Most likely naïve to the clear, crisp faux-funk coming out of his product, I guess you could say
    the man's just making a living.</p><p>
    Evolution does not imply progress, only change, so there's no problem with Boston's triple-threat Edan
    ignoring this modern technological path.  Ditching the J-O-B, this rapper/DJ/producer instead bows down to
    the almighty Tadao Kikumoto, mastermind behind Roland.  Edan has himself mastered the tricks of all Roland's
    various x0x rhythm machines, putting his talent to good use to create this harmlessly facile, yet just plain
    fun, six-song (four are new) follow-up EP to the excellent <i>Primitive Plus</i>.  But by calling this
    release simple and amusing-- and going along with the Golden Age production techniques-- <i>Sprain Your
    Tapedeck</i> shouldn't be dismissed as mere 80s kitsch.  If recent outside production credits to Count Bass
    D and Mr. Lif arex92t enough hip-hop cred, Edan makes it abundantly clear on his own records: he knows what
    he's doing.</p><p>
    Combining the hilarity of his Biscuithead 12-inch debut (1999's ""Sing It, Shitface"") with the nostalgia of
    the recent <i>Critical Beatdown</i>-era tribute track ""Ultra 88"", this record is a retardedly good time.
    ""Let's B. Friends"", a priceless plea for a new buddy to cool out with, comes complete with a young LL Cool J
    whisper: ""Let's go over and play some video games/ At the arcade you know we'll just hang out/ Yeah, and
    we'll work on our rhymes/ My metaphors are okay, how are yours?""  Adorable!  Production-wise, the track is
    surprisingly nuanced with 808 drum rolls, immersed in timely handclaps.  While it's completely dull running
    down the technical on a song like this, it should be emphasized that Edan has honed in on his craft; this
    clever recreation of a sound long dead in hip-hop is shockingly well-executed.</p><p>
    Actually, let's forget legitimizing-- ""Beautiful Food"" is the funniest shit I've heard in years.  Edan just
    lists a bunch of food.  That's it, that's the entire song.  Over a poppy, Latin guitar, he reads: ""Falafels
    with tahini/ Eggs scrambled with Monterey Jack cheese/ Cream of broccoli soup/ Portobello mushrooms/ Pigs
    in a blanket/ Mueslix..."" and so forth.  At the risk of being a cornball, if you aren't smiling during this
    song, check your pulse.</p><p>
    Joke-songs aside, ""Clinical Rhymes"" (ft. Skillz Ferguson) evidences some convincing lyrical ability over a
    beat that runs the gamut of hip-hop references, flipping up eleven (!) times.  The kickdrum-heavy, snot-nosed
    rhyming of ""Schoolly D Knew the Time"" pays homage to the Philadelphia emcee, further exposing the knack Edan
    has for a dirty, basement production style.  Sure, this record is a laugh overall, but don't pass this guy
    off as some patsy Har Mar Superstar jerkoff.  Edan is a one-man hip-hop army.  Ice-grilling backpackers
    (yes, they're still around) take heed: his output is a welcome breath of dusty fresh air.</p></div>"|2681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2681-sprain-your-tapedeck/|7.4|Matt Kallman

    Christian Kleine, on which they aim to find common ground between their
    very public adorations for 80s synth pop (Herrmann's passion) and
    instrumental hip-hop (Kleine's).  The common ground they've found
    is early 90s UK indie-- apparently the point at which the Venn diagrams
    marked 'Visage-y synth-pop' and 'DJ Premier's dopest beatz' intersect
    is Slowdive's <em>Souvlaki</em>. My incredulity in no way impeaches
    <em>Souvlaki</em>-- it is, after all, the über-shoegazer album. Rather,
    I'm perplexed that delicate and stylistically conservative shoegazing
    would be the arena where experimental IDM chaps like Herrmann and Kleine
    would find shared passions.</p><p>
    
    So instead of, for instance, a renewed take on Suicide that would
    expose fey electroclashers for the posturing clotheshorses they truly
    are, <em>Our Noise</em> is a serene and utterly unchallenging
    collection.  Opening with ""Drop,"" the duo set the parameters of the
    template they'll use extensively and predictably for the next 45
    minutes.  The track perfectly combines blunted beats with chiming
    ethereality, and does so in such a precise and calculated manner that
    the track that follows it, ""Her Tune,"" is almost indistinguishable.
    The mopey, angelic mood that characterized Chapterhouse's <em>Whirlpool</em>
    and Northern Picture Library's entire output prevails-- unmodified and
    unchecked. It's only when a fast-running marimba comes into the third
    track, ""Kissing You,"" at 120 BPM that I notice any difference at all.</p><p>
    
    As if to pay even more blatant homage to the indie scene of a decade
    ago, Herrmann and Kleine cover a 'lost classic'-- Slab Happy's ""Blue
    Flower."" The fanboys amongst you will immediately point out that
    elegant maudlineers Pale Saints and Mazzy Star have already covered
    ""Blue Flower,"" which makes it kind of a shoe-y standard, I suppose.
    And within the <em>Our Noise</em> frame of reference, it's a perfectly
    fitting cover. Herrmann and Kleine's version is gorgeous, but evanescent:
    Ariane Henselís voice is well-suited to mimic Hope Sandoval's. But like
    every track here, it's just too damn insubstantial to make me do anything
    but pass onto the next song without pause or consideration.</p><p>
    
    Furthering their wallpaper strategy on ""Wonder,"" Herrmann and Kleine
    give their no doubt accurate artistic impression of Slowdive's ""Catch
    The Breeze""-- as remixed by Plastikman, then chilled-out by the Grid.
    In the course of ""Wonder"" I can distinctly perceive each of the three
    evolutionary stages and am mildly amused, but ""Wonder"" is hardly a
    worthy object of excessive contemplation-- it's an uncomplicated and
    ultimately purposeless rendering.</p><p>
    
    It's impossible not to assess <em>Our Noise</em> as anything but as
    boilerplate IDM-inflected shoegazing-- it's the work of talented
    musicians sculpting guileless sound in lieu of substance.  I hope
    the next time they collaborate, Herrmann and Kleine investigate what
    separates them instead of what homogenizes them.</p></div>"|3838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3838-our-noise/|6.3|Paul Cooper

    shittiest days of my adult life. I entered the club audibly groaning.
    But by the time super-speedy, explosive, cock-rock lunacy took the stage,
    I was actually <em>smiling</em>, for crying out loud, to say nothing of
    feeling the need to raise the red hand of rock and holler like a
    demolition obsessed, mullet-sportin' tweaker at a monster truck show.</p><p>
    
    As one of the more unique names on the Kill Rock Stars roster, the
    Tight Bro's From Way Back When have, since 1997, become one of the
    preeminent Friday night party-rock bands for otherwise uptight indie
    kids looking to get plowed, go nuts, practice air guitar, and unleash
    their inner hesher without looking over their shoulder to see who's
    watching. Listening to the Tight Bro's is hardly an intellectual
    activity-- though, don't get me wrong, they know what they're doing.
    The Tight Bro's are vocalist/screamer Jared Warren (formerly of
    Karp), guitarists John ""Quitty"" Quittner and Dave Harvey (of Behead
    the Prophet), bassist Sean Kelly (of Gene Defcon), and a fairly
    impressive list of ex-drummers for a band that's only been around for
    five years.  A quick gander at the <em>Lend You a Hand</em> cover art,
    featuring the smiling head of Charlemagne, some lightening bolts, and
    the multicolored faces of the band members would seem to verify that
    the Tight Bro's are not inclined to take themselves too seriously.</p><p>
<em>Lend You a Hand</em>, the band's sophomore full-length, is 37
    minutes of tightly packed, over-the-top rock action that unabashedly
    channels AC/DC by way of the Stooges, without diluting the formula
    with masturbatory solos or pretentious harmonic noodling. Cartoon
    liner notes urge listeners to sing along-- ""If you're having a hard
    time figuring out which lyrics to sing along with, let the Tight Bro's
    lead the way... or make up your own, clap hands, etc.""  If you're
    even remotely inclined toward guitar rock, it won't be hard to do as
    instructed-- especially when the opportunity presents itself in the
    first song to howl, ""You're vicious, you're nasty,"" along with Warren
    (don't try this at the office).</p><p>
    
    The first track, ""Make It A Habit,"" builds out of a din of feedback
    and a baying coyote into a driving rhythm and the style of hyperkinetic
    guitar licks your fourteen-year-old cousin with the subscription to
    <em>Guitar Player</em> wishes he could play. It's hard to stay still
    while listening to this song. This is followed up by ""Bless Me,"" with
    its slightly raunchier, roadhouse feel-- truer, perhaps, to its AC/DC
    influence. Much of the album vacillates between roar and raunch,
    occasionally meshing them into the same song, one example being the
    metal swing of ""Gimme the Key.""</p><p>
    
    There's little extra racket on this album. I could have probably done
    without the Blues Explosion/Black Sabbath hybrid ""My Bad Luck,"" which
    takes too long to hit its groove, but this is a minor complaint.  The
    energy rarely flags on <em>Lend You a Hand</em>-- no small feat for an
    album that comes out of the gate at full-throttle roar. Even the covers--
    Joe Tex's ""Show Me"" and the Animals' ""Inside Looking Out""-- come off
    seamlessly.  The latter even reveals that Jared Warren has a
    better-than-average blues voice.</p><p>
    
    The current rock revival has spawned a number of vault-mining bands
    with old-fashioned tastes. The Tight Bro's are not the first to
    resurrect this genre (nor, from the looks of things, will they be the
    last), but there's a nice immediacy to their stuff. It feels good to
    listen to this right now, and imagine hiring them to play your most
    debauched backyard barbeque, without having to worry about the real
    effects of incipient madness at the first song.  Good stuff.</p></div>"|8058.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8058-lend-you-a-hand/|7.9|Alison Fields

    youngster want to move to an assisted-living community in Florida,
    get his hobble on, and stand behind a screen door in a cardigan yelling,
    ""It's my soccer ball now!""  Let's check the oldometer's current readings:</p><p>
<li> <strong>Badass:</strong> Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Johnny Cash, Elvis Costello<p>
<li> <strong>Still Kind of Mildly Half-Cool, In a Way:</strong> David Bowie, Lou
    Reed, Iggy Pop, Neil Young, Robert Pollard, Jagger/Richards<p>
<li> <strong>Why, Why Did You Duet with Rob Thomas and Kid Rock?:</strong> Willie Nelson<p>
<li> <strong>Hack/Dork:</strong> Paul McCartney<p>
    
    McCartney almost single-handedly stinks up the whole batch. If only
    Tom Waits had been given a seat and a microphone beside all those
    painkiller-and-vitamin-goofy ex-jock anchors at the Super Bowl
    halftime show, Waits could have responded to McCartney's ""Wouldn't it
    be great if, in these patriotic times, the Patriots won?"" blather by
    howling-- as he does on one of his two new albums-- ""Who gives a good
    goddamn?!""  In fact, Waits' new platters offer three rejoinders to
    ""Freedom,"" McCartney's banal attempt at a post-millennial
    moment-defining anthem: ""Misery Is the River of the World,""
    ""Everything Goes to Hell,"" and ""We're All Mad Here.""</p><p>
    
    Tom Waits has been milking the concept of the ramshackle apocalyptic
    carnival for twenty years now, flaunting a keen otherworldly
    nostalgia and a preoccupation with freaks that transcends the hell
    out of Harmony Korine's.  In the 80s-- when everything was measured
    in 'oodles' and forecasts didn't include a 30% chance of terrorism--
    Waits rescued himself from his role as a clever lounge slouch by
    going real weird right about the time he hitched himself to Kathleen
    Brennan, whose influence has grown with each release (she co-wrote
    and co-produced both new albums).  Back then, fans of the old Waits
    cried ""Yoko!"" but let's face it: that barroom-sage thing was getting
    pretty half-hearted.  It's difficult not to hear the new song ""Coney
    Island Baby"" as an ode to Brennan, the psycho-circus muse: ""Every
    night she comes/ To take me out to Dreamland.""</p><p>
    
    Both of Waits' new discs are their own concept albums, and both are
    collections of sick Germanic showtunes resulting from overseas
    theatrical collaborations with Robert Wilson (the man infamous for
    staging Philip Glass' <em>Einstein on the Beach</em>, and with whom
    Waits made <em>The Black Rider</em>). Both albums' subjects are
    headline-fodder: <em>Alice</em> deals with (ahem) (cough)
    intergenerational desire (reportedly based on Lewis Carroll and the
    famous little girl whose hand he would squeeze during their walks),
    while <em>Blood Money</em> (written to accompany the play <em>Woycek</em>)
    hazards the realm of psychopharmacology via its tale of old-world
    medical mind-tampering.  Waits makes his woebegone statements about
    the muck of modern life artfully and metaphorically, avoiding the
    overt outrage that leisure-class sophistos would label tedious.</p><p>
    
    These albums function in Waits' discography the way the film <em>The
    Man Who Wasn't There</em> fits into the Coen oeuvre: they are
    self-homages, full of superceding revisitations, that hone rather
    than advance. The exotica of <em>Swordfishtrombones</em>, the arch
    storytelling of <em>Rain Dogs</em>, and the better elements of the
    hit-and-miss <em>Mule Variations</em> are fully realized here,
    sustained for 91 cohesively transportative minutes of convoluted
    waltzes and marches. At one point, Waits even plinks the piano bit
    from ""Innocent When You Dream"" with a winking brio that whispers,
    ""Ain't I fun?""  <em>Blood Money</em>'s clomp-and-stomp and <em>Alice</em>'s
    musty ether represent the osteoporosis of <em>Bone Machine</em> and
    the senile dementia of <em>The Black Rider</em>, allowed to blossom
    into terminal malaise.</p><p>
    
    Both albums are further testament that Waits' inner cryptkeeper is
    getting sharper, combining disparate instruments with calamitous
    precision and conjuring worlds in which celebrities are born without
    bodies and razors 'find' throats. The music is so expressive and
    confident in its spook-ass vibe that it's flat-out cinematic.  The
    instrumentals serve as aural Rorsharchs (the gorgeous violin of ""Fawn""
    made me see bugs mating-- now you try!) and Waits' voice is warmly
    recorded on each of the pump-organ-and-stand-up-bass dirges, some of
    which seem to channel the balcony-leaping spirit of a heroin-shriveled
    Chet Baker.</p><p>
    
    The guitar of ""Starving in the Belly of a Whale"" sounds like an
    animatronic parasite prancing on your spine.  ""Lost in the Harbour""
    captures the creaky havoc of metal bending to the sea. ""Lullaby"" is
    a perfect nugget of twilight insecurity, and the nightmare cartoon
    of ""Kommienezuspadt"" begs for a club mix. Every syllable of ""God's
    Away on Business"" is a seizure, with the <em>Ben-Hur</em> slaveship-rowing
    coach pumping the tempo to ramming speed. Those of you who first heard
    Tom Waits, as I did-- that is, over lasagna at the house of a junior-high
    teacher with a skin disease who was trying to seduce you-- will relish the
    albums' creepy love songs.  They shine a morbid light on how most love-pop
    reduces the world to a consuming need for one magical person, and how
    often it's a bum swap: the Alice of <em>Alice</em> brings its protagonist
    an ounce of redemption and a ton of ruin. </p><p>
    
    Okay, so you might find the voices silly (there's Ancient-Mariner-on-a-bender,
    post-pubescent Grover, Golem-in-a-tux, and Gungan Boss Hogg).  Okay, so this
    is the first group of Waits songs where the ingredients seem so familiar that
    listeners feel empowered enough to try to guess the recipe and write their
    very own Tom Waits Song (I'm talking to you, Joe Henry).  Okay, so a moratorium
    should be imposed on the kiss/bliss rhyme. Okay, so some of the recombinatory
    stunts of <em>The Man Who Wasn't There</em> felt autopiloted and didn't satisfy
    as much as the first time you encountered them. Okay, so Anti's copy editor
    should have to rescue rabbits from cosmetics testing labs to atone for how
    badly they transcribed and jumbled the lyrics in the booklet. (What gives? I
    bet Epitaph has a brigade of undergrad interns that sort out each apostrophe
    in Bad Religion liner notes.)</p><p>
    
    Still, you should be ashamed you bought that Cursive, or Pedro the Lion, or
    Ladytron CD, and get these.  Synth-pooh and guitar-flarney doesn't have jack
    on calliopes, marimbas, chamberlains, cellos, and tubas, all of it in classily
    surreal packaging that screams ""Fuck the Grammys.""  While the rest of pop
    culture infantilizes itself with cussing puppets and manufactured bands who
    willfully dangle like marionettes, Waits is serving up vintage brittle fusion
    and somehow breaking the law of diminishing returns. Something wicked this way
    hams, and it ain't afraid to be misanthropic and admit that humans are just
    monkeys trained to parallel park. Come on, you Disney puds, it's time to let
    Waits and David Lynch do Kafka's <em>Metamorphosis</em> as a musical.</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|8564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8564-alice-and-blood-money/|9.0|William Bowers

    so I won't hold it against the Spanish label Acuarela for this
    somewhat vain collection of songs. ""Acuarela"" is Spanish for
    watercolor, and all the songs included on this two-disc contair
    the word ""somewhere in the title, the spirit or the lyrics,""
    according to the liners.  Simple enough, and most bands play along,
    though some are certainly a stretch. I'm not sure how Mojave 3's ode
    to Mark Kozelek, ""Krazy Koz,"" fits the criterion, but I won't hold
    these slips against them either because so many of the songs here--
    almost all of them otherwise unreleased-- are so darn good.</p><p>
    
    Most comps like this take a shotgun approach, scattering an assortment
    of songs in the listener's direction, and hoping something hits the mark.
    <em>Acuarela Songs</em>, on the other hand, has a fairly clear aesthetic
    goal in mind: to collect the best in American, Spanish, French, and
    Australian sad white bastard music. Mojave 3, the Court and Spark, the
    Clientele, Mark Eitzel, Giant Sand mainman Howe Gelb, perpetual Pedro
    the Lion opening act TW Walsh, the Mountain Goats, and the Willard Grant
    Conspiracy are some of the bigger names on this comp. And, as might be
    expected, many of the participating artists come off as if they just
    scoured their vaults when asked to contribute. The greatest offender ir
    this respect is Mark Eitzel, who sounds as if he didn't even have a
    complete song lying around, and instead of coming up with something
    new, just spliced together a few unfinished bits and called it a day.
    Likewise, Howe Gelb scraps up a 1\xBD-minute acoustic track that starts
    out promising then disintegrates, sounding like the tape just ran out
    on him.</p><p>
    
    But I'm not going to waste too much time on the disappointing and
    mediocre (of which there is plenty). I'd rather focus on the
    surprising and satisfying (likewise, plenty).  ""The Colour of Water""
    from the Leeds-based Dakota Suite, is a super smooth cool-jazz
    instrumental with dual trumpet/guitar lead and amazing interplay from
    the rhythm section. Greg Weeks' ""The Waves"" is an ambitious psych-pop
    workout with a creepy vocal delivery, a heavy fuzz guitar riff, and
    a quiet organ-lead outro-- it's a full album wrapped up in 5\xBD minutes.
    I've been putting off buying his album for months, and I might just
    have to do it after this sample.</p><p>
    
    ""Watercolor Rose,"" from Nashville
    singer/songwriter Doug Hoekstra, is a classic melancholy reminiscence.
    The closely miked vocals and achingly distant trumpet create a nice
    discrepancy that easily pulls you through the story-song about the
    natural selectivity of memory.  Elsewhere, ""John King's Watercolor
    Bicycle"" by M. Ward is like Paul Westerburg via Red Krayola, while
    Tracker's ""Water Fills the Bedroom"" rides a rusty wheelbarrow atop
    Fahey-like fingerpicking.</p><p>
    
    Highlights of disc two include Paloma's ""Watercolor..."", just a shade
    away from your standard folk fare-- banjo and acoustic guitar accompanying
    plaintive, slightly flat Damien Jurado-style vocals-- but what a difference
    that shade makes. Australia's Sodastream give their naturally skewed take
    on Oldham-esque weird-folk with ""Coloring Iris.""  The abrasive lo-fi jangle
    of the Mountain Goats' ""Saigon Shrunken Panorama"" comes as a bit of a shock,
    but this is never a bad thing where John Darnielle is concerned, and the song,
    as should be expected by now, is exceptional.</p><p>
    
    As you can see, most of the worthwhile moments on <em>Acuarela Songs</em>
    come courtesy of the lesser known acts, which I suppose should be
    expected-- you gotta swing for the fences when you get fewer at-bats.
    But despite the overall quality and the relative focus of the collection,
    with 32 tracks, it's all a bit overwhelming and difficult to trudge
    through all at once. A clear use for a collection like this is as
    random play fodder for your CD changer. But if you're like me, someone
    who detests random play, there are few uses for something like this:
    something to help get you across the notorious talk-and-country-radio-only
    zone of central Ohio maybe, or a means for discovering some new artists
    without much initial investment.</p><p>
    
    Listening to this entire two-hour-plus collection straight through is
    something like tuning into a college radio station during the wee hours
    of a weeknight, some lonely first-semester sophomore behind the mic,
    just discovering his or her taste for mopey indie rock, seeking some
    kind of connection over the airwaves.  In short: spotty.</p></div>"|1841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1841-acuarela-songs/|6.9|Jason Nickey

    nation, but I know something amazing when I hear it, and I'm hearing
    it right now. Thirty years since hip-hop first snuck off the streets
    and into the collective American consciousness, a bunch of kids from
    seemingly unlikely places-- Maine, Minneapolis, Nova Scotia-- are
    reinventing the form yet again. Anticon does hip-hop the way Miles'
    second quintet did jazz: technically, everything's right where it
    belongs, it's just hard to tell because everything sounds so different.
    Sure, there are beats and scratching and verbal acrobatics, but not
    quite in the ways that we're accustomed to.</p><p>
    
    This is hip-hop made by people who grew up with hip-hop, music created
    by a generation whose defining skill is their ability to absorb and
    interpret mass media. Where the originators of modern hip-hop were
    students of soul, funk, jazz and spoken word, Anticon's revisionists
    are students of pop culture as a whole. This is reflected in the records
    they make-- schizophrenic journeys through foreign soundscapes that
    change every minute, accompanied by abstract narratives that seem more
    introspective than the usual self-aggrandizing.</p><p>
    
    The production itself is twisted, owing more to the fast-paced
    chop-suey of Negativland or Eugene Chadbourne than it does to the
    crisp beats of the Automator. The music changes just as often as the
    rappers' cadences.  MCs criss and cross, enigmatic verses proudly
    bounding with slant rhyme (and, at times, pure gibberish) twist in
    and out of one another, simultaneous bursts of verbiage intertwining
    the same way Miles and Wayne Shorter's horns did-- in synch one
    second, bursting into polar opposite directions the next.  Then,
    before you've even registered the change, they're back again. You
    can't make out all the words, but you also get the comforting
    impression that you're not really supposed to. So instead you cling
    on to whatever vocal snippets you can: bits about ""liquids descending,
    my certainty still mending"" and ""citizens tearing up the floorboard.""</p><p>
    
    Deep Puddle Dynamics opens things with ""More from June""-- a menacing
    piece of music compiled by DJ Mayannaise and Grapedope, then whipped
    further into shape by guest producer John Herndon.  Police sirens
    wail, just barely audible over alternating drones pierced sporadically
    by syncopated beats and free-floating minimal scratches as Anticon
    co-founder and Atmosphere member Slug intones.  Suddenly, dubby
    machine-gun percussion breaks through, destroying the groove, as
    cLOUDDEAD's Dose One breaks in, spitting words too fast for human
    comprehension.</p><p>
    
    The title track is a collective work, a reinterpretation of an
    earlier composition by the same name. It begins with a crackly old
    jazz sample set to a jungle beat. The crew informs us that, as the
    title promises, they ""ain't fessin'.""  The music stops short. The
    MCs introduce themselves, but their words are eventually lost in
    a heavy gust of turntable static.  Then a mantra, as bursts of
    ominous synths grow steadily in the background: ""The first lie/
    Wasn't much like of lie/ Less like a lie/ More like a wish with
    a spine/ Doublecrossed by time."" This isn't easy stuff: there are
    uncomfortable pauses, unpredictable shifts in speed and rhythm.
    But it all pays off when an elusive female vocal is suspended in
    space, nefarious basslines echoing in a mutating murk of chopped-up
    garage sale vinyl and gurgling electronic noise. From a baseball
    stadium, to a political rally, to a game show, these eighteen minutes
    wander through more audio environments than most full-lengths.</p><p>
    
    The EP closes with a production by Jel and Sixtoo called ""Pitty Party
    People"" which almost resembles a straightforward hip-hop track, built
    from melodic guitar loops, cheesy synthlines, a relatively straightforward
    beat, and more of the same stellar rhymes.  By usual standards, it'd
    be a stunning example of hip-hop, mighty catchy and madly upbeat. But
    here it's got a tough act to follow.</p><p>
    
    At a mere three tracks and 18 minutes, <em>We Ain't Fessin' (Double
    Quotes)</em> isn't a critical departure for those already familiar
    with the Anticon brand. But the quick approach may serve well when it
    comes to recruiting new listeners-- all rapid-fire changes and
    unapologetic weirdness, <em>We Aint Fessin' (Double Quotes)</em> makes
    for one king hell mindfuck of an introduction for the uninitiated.</p></div>"|215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/215-we-aint-fessin-double-quotes-ep/|8.2|David M. Pecoraro

    crowded with upper-class college boys and eccentric old men: a
    legitimate redneck.  Hailing from a rural logging town thirty miles
    east of Seattle, Brock grew up in a rusty trailer, doomed to the
    blue-collar nightmare of foundry life or some other back-breaking
    eternity.  Over the past ten years, he's seen the backwoods town's
    tall pines and muddy soil swallowed alive by the corporate monster
    and shit back out as duplexes and strip malls. What little nature
    remains there now is permeated with the death stench of ChemLawr
    yards and Wendy's drive-thrus.  So, after the success of Modest
    Mouse's classic <i>The Moon and Antarctica</i>, Brock packed up
    and moved to Cottage Grove, Oregon, another even more remote
    logging town-- one whose chances of becoming a suburban hellhole
    are about as likely as his mother's of winning a Powerball jackpot.</p><p>
    
    Brock is extremely candid in interviews about his love of drugs,
    particularly psychedelics and uppers.  As everyone knows, there's not
    a lot to do out in nature but get high, and there's <i>nothing</i>
    like getting high in nature.  It gets you thinking about the broader
    picture-- typical hippie shit like your place in the universe, and
    the usual depressive shit like your own mortality and irrelevance.
    This kind of environment can't be good for a guy who, beneath his
    surly exterior, is about as depressed as a motherfucker comes.  But
    it helps him write, and when that's all you've got going for you,
    you go where it comes easiest.</p><p>
    
    I have little doubt that Brock wrote a great deal of the lyrics for
    <i>The Moon and Antarctica</i> on psychedelics, as many of his
    insights were so disconnected and profound that they could only
    have come to him in a moment of altered consciousness.  But recently,
    including during the recording of that album, he's spent a lot of time
    in stone-sober Chicago, where psychedelics are considered hideously
    lower-class and drink is the drug of choice.  None of this affected
    his magnum opus-- presumably because he was still hanging mostly with
    his druggy bandmates-- but Brock's solo debut as Ugly Casanova reeks
    of mental clarity, sacrificing the great philosophical lyrics of
    records past for pleasantly poetic, but never revelatory, subject
    matter.</p><p>
    
    Brock recorded <i>Sharpen Your Teeth</i> with Red Red Meat's Briar
    Deck, Califone's Tim Rutili, Pall Jenkins of Black Heart Procession,
    and a few random others at his Portland home studio, Glacial Pace,
    which he built using the advance Sub Pop offered him to record this
    very record.  But let's consider his company here: Deck-- producer of
    the last Modest Mouse album and the first installment of Brock's Ugly
    Casanova side project-- for all his culvert reverb and glistening,
    interstellar software tricks, strikes me immediately as a man who has
    either never ingested a poisonous mushroom in his life or has long
    since outgrown such leanings.  Rutili's work with Califone is marked
    by its junkyard percussion and Budweiser Americana.  Jenkins sounds
    like he walks around in graveyards all day praying for inevitable
    death to just get it all over with.  This is no company for abusing
    prescription tranquilizers.</p><p>
    
    But maybe that's the purpose of this project, to step away from the
    pursuit of universal knowledge and convey a simpler desperation.  Or
    maybe he just wanted a new cast of characters to collaborate with.
    And this is indeed a collaboration.  Though the songwriting-- which
    all members had a hand in, right down to the lyrics-- sounds
    unmistakably like Modest Mouse, you can hear the distinct marks of
    all the other players.  It's initially evident on ""Spilled Milk
    Factory,"" and later on ""Pacifico,"" both of which feature clanging
    percussion and sparse background peripherals echoing Califone's
    <i>Roomsound</i>.</p><p>
    
    The collaborative nature of <i>Sharpen Your Teeth</i>, of course,
    yields a few missteps, the worst of which stumbles backwards and
    breaks it neck: ""Diamonds on the Face of Evil"" is an awkwardly
    loping experiment in which Brock recites a few lines of nonsense
    padded with the ceaselessly hollered refrain of ""shey shaw shey
    shaw!""   Likewise, ""Parasites"" comes on like some absurd postmortem
    parade, with blaring synth trumpets and Isaac morbidly insisting that
    ""the parasites are excited when you're dead/ Eyes bulging, entering your
    head/ And all your thoughts... THEY ROT!""  ""Ice on the Sheets"" is, at
    6\xBD minutes, repetitive and overlong, and ""Bee Sting,"" though surely
    intended as a segue, hinders the flow of the album-- a tuneless
    interlude with Isaac offering some of the least thought-provoking
    lyrics of his career.</p><p>
    
    There are some damn fine moments here, though.  Brock seems to have
    been born with an innate talent to impart the sourest dejection.  His
    approach is more akin to Arlo Guthrie than to the mop-headed, crybaby
    adolescentry that presently dominates our rock.  If he stuffed his
    shit with 75-cent dictionary finds, it'd be one thing, but he uses
    plain English to communicate complex meditations, analyses that could
    as easily be grasped by drunken farmhands as by world-class poets.
    The finest of these crops up on ""Hotcha Girls,"" when Brock, at his
    most austere, sings, ""Don't you know that you'll rust, and not belong
    so much, and then get left alone.../ Don't you know that old folks'
    home smells so much like my own.""</p><p>
    
    The opener, ""Barnacles,"" has Brock referencing classic Rolling Stones
    amidst antisocial daydreams: ""I don't need to see/ I don't see how
    you see/ Out of your window/ I don't need to see, I'll paint it
    black.""  Then there's the killer two-song punch that ends the record:
    ""Things I Don't Remember"" recalls the very best upbeat and
    rhythm-oriented Mouse moments, with truly propulsive percussior
    hitting with ferocious thwacks, as if trying to better the Pixies'
    ""U-Mass.""  When the song springs to life out of the pleasantly
    countrified ""Smoke Like Ribbons,"" it hits with such caffeinated
    urgency that its surrealist lyrics actually become incredibly
    <i>fun</i> where they might otherwise have been fatally clumsy.
    This guides us to the reflective closer, ""So Long to the Holidays,""
    which evokes both wistful memories of past Christmases, and going
    off somewhere to die-- and with just two simple lyrics.</p><p>
<i>Sharpen Your Teeth</i> was undoubtedly a therapeutic outing for
    Isaac Brock, giving him some time to recuperate from his band's
    definitive statement and temporarily alleviating the pressure of
    making the next one.  And lucky for us, the final product fares far
    better than these things generally do.  Rutili is an able guitarist
    and lyricist, as is contributor John Orth (who got his start in the
    Florida-based band Holopaw), and Brian Deck's production, though
    sometimes excessively spacy, is always warm and nicely balanced.
    That said, I'm looking forward to Brock falling back in with his
    old crowd.  The drugs might not be good for him, but the inspiratior
    is.</p></div>"|8332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8332-sharpen-your-teeth/|7.3|Ryan Schreiber

    mind that might drive one to bossa nova music. I was on the beach
    this weekend on a sunny day, and the air was still freezing.  The
    local clam shack and ice cream stand had opened but the people in
    line were wearing windbreakers; this year's scoop girls are only just
    starting to build the biceps that they'll take to school next fall.</p><p>
    
    It doesn't get hot enough in Portland, Oregon for music like this,
    and maybe that's why Chad Crouch and Blanket Music recorded
    <em>Move</em> in the South Pacific, on balmy Island 734-001 of the
    Bikini Atoll.  They're joined by the beautiful voices of Esperanza
    Spalding (of Noise for Pretend) and Corrina Repp, who sound as smooth
    as ice against a hot torso. ""Shut up and sway your hips,"" they
    implore, and the tropical songs and warm recording couldn't sound
    more like an afternoon at a bar by the beach.  They even put a
    cocktail umbrella in the spine of the disc, to illustrate what
    you're missing.</p><p>
    
    Crouch says this is party music, and it is, though it's also good
    hangover music: soothing and free of shrill noise.  The hooks are
    so subtle and laid-back that it can take a few listens to appreciate
    Crouch's catchy songwriting-- most notably on ""K - A - R - A
    [breathless] O - K [keep it coming] EEEeeeeeeeee,"" where his
    droopy-dog vocals and clever lyrics dance over a catchy guitar riff.
    Greg Lind's drumming is limber but restrained, and even the drum
    machine that augments the music is nicely integrated-- as on the hot
    jazz-meets-IDM ""Itchy Popcorn,"" which builds to speaker-shaking bass.
    Crouch is a low-key frontman with a thin, melodic voice, perfect for
    the tone of this record, and he and Ross Seligman play killer
    staccato lines on guitar.</p><p>
    
    I'd expect American bossa nova to be as bad as other Americanized
    ethnic creations, like American ska, or American chop suey.  In
    addition to having a stand-up band, Crouch succeeds by not pretending
    to be anything he isn't-- instead of posing as a smooth island
    loverboy, he sticks to wry lyrics and mundane topics.  He has
    three jobs: as a musician, as a designer, and as the head of this
    label; and he likes to talk about the need to slow down.  Like the
    'to do' list that's set to a beautiful tune on ""Walk the Dog,"" or his
    potshots at hip visual artists in ""Hot Designers.""  He writes witty
    love songs about (though not necessarily <i>to</i>) his ""incredible""
    girlfriend, who he describes so sweetly in the liner notes that I
    winced hoping they haven't broken up since this came out.  For example,
    the cutesy interplay in ""Tap the Beat"" (He: ""And if I lost my legs...""
    She: ""I would put you on my back/ And I would grab things off the
    shelf for you"").  Hey, guys, get a room!</p><p>
    
    On a song like ""Costa Del Sol"" there's genuine yearning in Crouch's
    voice, the note of sincerity that makes it compelling and not just
    exotic.  What does he yearn for?  Maybe his girlfriend, though she
    probably hangs around plenty; maybe something as global as world
    peace, as on ""Get Togetha.""  But more than anything, it sounds like
    Crouch wanted to vacation in a warm place and to party.  And on the
    defrosting boardwalks, in the last gusts of New England's waning
    chill, that's good enough for me.</p></div>"|793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/793-move/|7.8|Chris Dahlen

Or so a sect of critic types will tell you, and
    they may very well be correct.  For at some point in the last couple
    of generations, you-- the reader, and the listener, and the citizen--
    became the focus of the critical experience.  Interaction, cooperation,
    and an overwhelming desire to place the epicenter of control (or at
    least an illusion of control) within the mind of you, the reader,
    has become paramount.  Think of all the reviews you've read about
    how the music affects a particular reviewer: ""I envision fields of
    amber, and a sudden calm overtakes me-- it reminds me of my
    kindergarten class photo, documentary yet ultimately sentimental.""
    And you have no idea what the music sounds like.  But that's okay,
    at least you know that it had some kind of profound effect on the
    writer, and that's what good music is supposed to do, right?</p><p>
    
    I mean, it's cool that someone can take a piece of music, and strip
    away all the packaging and context, and just let it transport (or
    transform) them.  The experience is the key there.  So, what if I
    told you the music described above was actually field recordings of
    insects, multiplied and manipulated to sound like a battlefield, or
    some kind of spaced-out fizz generator?  Tribes of Neurot practically
    demand that you, the listener, make your own judgement, because
    <em>Adaptation and Survival: The Insect Project</em> was made with
    interaction and listener choice in mind.  The Californian outfit
    encourages listeners to play both of the discs in this set
    simultaneously (<em>Zaireeka</em>-style) on different players for
    ""further depth into the sound of insects.""  Neurot go so far as to
    give you a mission statement: ""The only limits are of your imagination
    and effort.""  The author is dead!  Long live the new authors-- that
    means you and me.</p><p>
    
    For their part, Tribes of Neurot have invested a few years into their
    experimentation and general strangeness.  The outfit is made up of
    most of the members of the avant death-metal band Neurosis (though,
    in keeping with the dead author motif, none are listed on the CD
    jacket).  Neurosis specializes in extreme noise terror, by way of
    your workaday rock band instrumentation.  Though Tribes tone down the
    violent outbursts, opting for dark ambience, they inhabit similarly
    doom-gloomy realms.  The two camps continue to exist concurrently,
    and have even breached the multi-play strategy before with Neurosis'
    1999 release <em>Times of Grace</em> meant to be played alongside
    Tribes of Neurot's <em>Grace</em>.</p><p>
    
    It sounds very compelling-- there's something inherently exciting
    about never really knowing what the music will sound like each time
    you play it.  At the same time, the concept may be self-defeating.
    In Tribes' case, their alien static symphony of bugs is probably
    going to sound close to a wall of noise for most folks no matter what
    combinations are playing-- though, all bets are off if you're high
    (seriously, it may take that for some people to get close to this
    stuff).  <em>Adaptation and Survival</em> begs the question: what's
    better, a pristine recording of digitally enhanced bugs, or going
    outside in the summer and hearing real ones?  At least <em>Zaireeka
    had</em> Wayne Coyne, who hasn't come anywhere near my backyard, as
    far as I know.</p><p>
    
    So, it's a bit difficult to focus on these sounds.  The first disc is
    comprised of mixes of a vinyl edition of this set, supposedly split
    into three separate records to mix and match as you will.  ""High
    Mobility"" actually contains insect samples looped and processed to
    the point of making it seem like there is an actually tonality at
    work.  A fuzzy drone colors the background of the track, and the
    buzzing of who knows what winged-bug pans across the speakers.
    ""Adaptability"" uses cricket sounds and some very creepy wing-flapping
    samples, supporting more processed insect noise that sounds like a
    murky synth line.  In fact, I counted no less than four different
    sounds of flying insects in this track.  If you don't like flying
    bugs, it's probably best to steer clear of this release.</p><p>
    
    The epic ""Metamorphosis"" begins with a low hum of flying insects en
    masse.  This is what I imagine a plague of locusts might actually
    sound like-- the samples are so densely multiplied, the overall
    effect is not dissimilar to hearing a jet engine.  Things take a turn
    for the disgusting, when what sounds like ants feeding on a decaying
    carcass works its way through the mix.  You can imagine what kind of
    dual-stereo nightmares Tribes of Neurot could cause you-- but
    remember, they only recorded the stuff and its up to you to
    completely gross yourself out!</p><p>
    
    The second disc contains a mix of ""a single potential outcome"" of the
    various sounds from the original set.  For sheer acidic haze, this is
    the disc to put on for company.  The sounds, while still recognizable
    as insects, blend together to form a much more rootless horror.
    Suffice it to say that when locust plagues and frenzied ants are the
    closest points of reference (other than alien terror, that is), good
    times are not in order.  Tribes of Neurot have produced an impressive
    document of studio wizardry and apparently a steadfast dedication to
    capturing the hidden sounds of bugs everywhere--it's up to you and me
    to make something of it.  <em>Adaptation and Survival</em> kills
    authors dead.</p></div>"|8151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8151-adaptation-and-survival-the-insect-project/|5.1|Dominique Leone

    winner for the coveted Most Misleading Album Cover Of The Year award.
    Squint your eyes and take a look: a bunch of meticulously rumpled
    bedheaded ladies and gents lounging on a vintage couch, one of whom
    is even reading a magazine with the Strokes on the cover for
    chrissakes.  What's more, The Boggs are on Arena Rock Recordings,
    based in the trendy, scene-making borough known as Brooklyn (invest
    in Queens, people).  So they've gotta be one of them garage bands the
    kids are diggin' these days, like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs or the Mooney
    Suzuki, right?</p><p>
    
    Ahhh, but my skin-deep deductive powers show their complete
    inadequacy approximately five seconds into the album, when opener
    ""Whiskey and Rye"" blasts off not with fuzzy power chords but with
    fierce mandolin strumming.  It quickly becomes clear that the garage
    from which the Boggs' music emanates must be hay-strewn, with a lucky
    horseshoe tacked above the door-- if it's not a barn.  More than any
    <em>NME</em> flavor-of-the-month band, The Boggs come off as kinfolk to
    The Pogues, with their reverence for traditional music and Jason
    Friedman's failed-Breathalyzer-test slur.  Rather than the spooky
    melodies of the Green Isle, however, good ol' American bluegrass lies
    at the heart of The Boggs' music, no doubt sporting overalls and a
    straw hat to boot.</p><p>
    
    The Boggs seem less concerned with grafting old-fashioned sensibilities
    to 21st century innovations than they are with creating the most
    authentic-sounding facsimile of pre-Nashville country music possible.
    While the concept of attractive New York thrift-shoppers playing
    Appalachian folk may have a certain white-rapper sheen of questionable
    credibility to it, The Boggs at least know how to record their hoedowns
    properly.  The sound is kept raw as a carpet burn, with the studio tracks
    sounding like the players are all hunched around a single microphone,
    the music blurred into a mish-mash of fiddle, accordion, harmonica,
    and found-item percussion.  ""On North Wood Ground"" and the male/female
    call-response tune ""Emily, O, Emily"" take it even further, with answering
    machine-level sound that aims to replicate the days when wax cylinders
    were the industry standard.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, The Boggs frequently seem to forget the other aspect of
    high-quality bluegrass: keeping things lightning-fast and ADD-short.
    ""A Picnic Lunch Packed for Two"" and ""The Airborne Station"" both do a
    bang-up job of showing why punk is just a couple steps down the genre
    family tree from bluegrass. But on other tracks the simple, repetitious
    arrangements get a little tiresome.  With little variation in song
    structure, and with Friedman not exactly a fountain of lyrical enunciation,
    there's not much to hold a listener's interest beyond the first couple
    times through the verse/chorus on ""Beside the Windowsill"" or ""How Long?""</p><p>
    
    Still, you have to credit The Boggs with having a different sound,
    one that allows me to use country-fried terms like 'barn-burning' and
    'skeedaddle-rific' to describe above-average tracks like ""Over the
    Way"" and ""A Direction Taken.""  It's amusing to imagine the Camper Van
    Beethoven-like outsider role they must play in the ultra-cool
    Brooklyn scene, performing in front of crowds too concerned with
    maintaining their studied ennui poses to give the music the
    elbows-splayed chicken dance it occasionally deserves.  While <em>We
    Are The Boggs We Are</em> might only be a fair collection of old-timey
    music, at least it doesn't have the nasty Grammy aftertaste of the
    <em>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</em> soundtrack.  Plus, they're a lot
    cuter than Ralph Stanley.</p></div>"|847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/847-we-are-the-boggs-we-are/|5.7|Rob Mitchum

But as a seemingly infinite stream of cliché-obsessed     singer/songwriters using misery as a thinly veiled ploy to get laid has proven,     very few people can do it well. Drawing inspiration from banal personal miseries     and girlfriend tragedies may indeed turn songwriting into some kind of a cleansing     experience, but nobody wants to be sprayed in the face with someone else's     emotional Lysol.  And being preached to?  That's nearly as bad.  Screamy thugs     recycling endless bullshit about the oppressive and destructive state of     capitalism, and yet selling their records for profit-- where's the dignity     in that?</p>
<p>Elvis Costello, more so than any other musician before or since, has managed to     integrate the insight of personal music and the conviction of political music,     while avoiding the self-indulgent pitfalls of both. To put it another way, Elvis     Costello could sing a song about the oppressive and destructive state of his     girlfriend and pull it off with wit and talent to spare.</p>
<p>With <i>My Aim Is True</i>, Costello immediately established himself as the     world's foremost angry geek with something to prove. And while the songs on     that album were absolutely stellar, Costello had yet to make his defining     statement.  Clover, who would later become the News and back up a lesser geek     who never managed to prove much of anything, did a great job backing Costello's     songs, but never really managed to sound like anything more than a backing band.</p>
<p>This, Elvis Costello's second album, marked the beginning of a long and     illustrious collaboration with the Attractions, not to mention one of those     glorious moments in which a musician discovers a sound that is all his own.     While <i>My Aim Is True</i> was largely a guitar-centered album, the sonic core     of <i>This Year's Model</i> consists almost entirely of drums, bass, and keyboards.     As a result, it's not only a more complex and dynamic album, but also one that     steers well clear of the retro guitar twang that marred the less interesting     bits of his debut.</p>
<p>Indeed, songs like ""Pump It Up"" and ""This Year's Girl"" sound like they were     essentially written from the rhythm section up. Pete Thomas' drumming is nothing     short of perfect-- on these two songs in particular he keeps the beat deep and     powerful, putting accents in all the right places without ever attempting to     take the spotlight off the freak up front.  With less rhythmically straightforward     songs, such as the vaguely reggae-inflected ""(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea,""     Thomas shifts accents faster than Miss Cleo, and with far more skill.</p>
<p>""(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea"" is by far the most angular tune to be found     on <i>This Year's Model</i>.  But at the other end of the spectrum sits ""Little     Triggers,"" a piano-driven pseudo-ballad that plays host to some of Costello's     best wordplay. ""Thinking all about those censored sequences/ Worrying about the     consequences/ Waiting until I come to my senses/ Better put it all in present     tenses,"" is characteristic of Costello's finest lyrics-- eloquently constructed     and uniquely insightful without ever being trite or obvious.</p>
<p>A more controversial lyrical highlight comes with ""Night Rally,"" a song that was     left off of the original U.S. release of <i>This Year's Model</i>. Costello never     shied away from using offensive and thought-provoking imagery in his songs, most     notably references to Nazi Germany. Sounding something like a new wave funeral     march, ""Night Rally"" sees Costello making a reference to ""singing in the showers,""     a line that's both cleverly disturbing and vice versa.</p>
<p>""Night Rally"" was intended to be the last song on <i>This Year's Model</i>, but     the folks at Rhino decided to stick the single ""Radio, Radio"" at the end of the     album itself, as was done on the original U.S. release. Given the great care     Rhino took with both the remastering and packaging of <i>This Year's Model</i>,     it seems odd that they would go and do something that acts contrary to the     original idea of the record.  But one can hardly bitch about the inclusion of     that track, easily one of the glowing highlights of the man's entire career.</p>
<p>Rhino's expanded reissue also includes a second disc of bonus material, some of     which is nearly as satisfying as the album itself.  ""Big Tears"" is one of his     finest unreleased tracks, and acoustic demos of ""Big Boys"" and ""Greenshirt,""     both of which later appeared on <i>Armed Forces</i>, provide an interesting     insight into the way Costello turned simple guitar tunes into fully formed     new wave masterpieces.</p>
<p>These three songs, as well as many other tracks on the bonus CD, were all     included as bonus tracks on the recent Rykodisc reissue of <i>This Year's Model</i>.     On this reissue, though, Rhino has added a decent number of additional tracks,     including alternate versions of ""You Belong to Me,"" ""Radio, Radio,"" ""This Year's     Girl,"" and ""(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea."" None of these versions are nearly     as good as those that appear on the original record, but every song on the bonus     disc is cast in a sufficiently different light from its album counterpart to     unquestionably warrant inclusion. Simply put, Rhino couldn't have done a much     better job here.</p>
<p>And it's a good thing, too, since this album deserves nothing less than a     flawless package.  Perfectly balancing the raw energy of <i>My Aim Is True</i> with the more elegant pop songwriting that would come to characterize much of     his later work, <i>This Year's Model</i> is not only Costello's best work, but     one of the most distinctively brilliant albums ever to be released.  For fans     of rock music bursting with wit and character, it really just doesn't get any     better than this.</p></div>"|1615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1615-this-years-model/|10.0|Matt LeMay

    the country, and these sounds come seemingly out of nowhere--  a
    woman's voice; a whispery, corporeal cello; a ghoulish eerie singing
    saw that strikes matches on your spine.  Something twisted, born
    wrong, is making this music.  And damned if it isn't gorgeous.</p><p>
    
    Nina Nastasia lives in New York City, but she must keep an outhouse
    and a shotgun in her apartment to dream up such an effective Southern
    Gothic record.  Every sound oozes atmosphere: creepy, bare, sometimes
    gloomy-- the title of one song, ""In the Graveyard,"" could describe
    half of them, and the lyrics are rich with references to falling
    leaves, ""little dead dogs,"" and a stranger that her father once
    chased from the house.  Other songs, hewing closer to country music,
    feel like a cool breeze through your hair.</p><p>
    
    Nastasia's arrangements use everything from guitar and drums to
    accordion, a few strings, and singing saw, and where other albums
    would treat these as embellishments, they're essential to the
    strength of <em>The Blackened Air</em>.  It's not unlike the bleak
    first album by fellow New Yorkers Clem Snide-- if you swapped Eef
    Barzelay with a woman, and if the rest of the band had fathered one
    another.  The instruments float in and out, right from the first
    track: Nastasia drifts in with her acoustic guitar, and then the full
    band swells through and vanishes.  Vibrant strings drive ""This Is
    What It Is"" while the accordion flutters through; on ""So Little,"" a
    beautiful ambling waltz, instruments come and go like guests at a
    barbeque-- an aching electric guitar figure, a cello weaving around
    the last verse. </p><p>
    
    The spare instrumentation suits the songs, half of which are under
    two minutes: ""The Very Next Day,"" four lines long, goes by so lightly
    that you don't notice when it leaves.  Diverse but never merely
    eclectic, it comes together as a patchwork of beautiful fragments
    hanging in silence: <em>How To Make An American Shroud.</em>  As for
    Nastasia's performance, her voice is not bad, and on some of the
    songs it fits perfectly-- she really puts her lungs into ""In the
    Graveyard,"" and on ""All For You"" her voice is plain and worn like a
    well loved, hand-me-down housedress.  On other songs--""Ugly Face,""
    for instance-- it's just plain.  But this lets Nastasia slip into the
    picture instead of making it center around her: while this might have
    been a fine singer-songwriter album, Nastasia has turned it into
    something far more interesting.</p><p>
    
    But the arrangement and delivery wouldn't be half as effective if
    <em>The Blackened Air</em> weren't recorded so beautifully, and for
    that we can thank Steve Albini.  That's right, Albini has produced a
    folk album, and it's one of the most pristine yet organic records
    I've heard, where every sound is clear enough to touch your nerve
    endings one by one.  Albini holds his own against such purveyors of
    silence as ECM Records, and this would be a great listen even if
    songs like ""So Little"" and ""This Is What It Is"" weren't excellent in
    their own right.  For all the raucous, brutal records Albini has
    recorded, this one, in its own way, is scarier than any of them.  I
    keep picturing the cellist as some lumbering figure with three
    fingers and one nostril.  But man, can he play.</p></div>"|5713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5713-the-blackened-air/|7.8|Chris Dahlen

    it was a scene that reminded me of tenth grade field-hockey away
    games, when we'd traverse the state, listening to the Indigo Girls
    and XTC on the school van's stereo.  This was 1991: we thought Indigo
    Girls' songs were about boys. We believed we were cool, sort of, ir
    the way only slightly off-kilter, naïve, uptight prep school girls
    might define as cool. We spent a lot of time waxing poetic about
    private Northeastern colleges and liberal politics and applying
    high school-level critical theory to R.E.M. and Cure lyrics. I don't
    look back at this part of my life with any great fond reminiscence
    or melodramatic despair. It was non-threatening, easy, heavily
    estrogenated, and dull. Six years later, when I was invited to
    attend Lilith Fair festivities ""as a guilty pleasure,"" the idea
    seemed about as appealing as retaking Algebra II.</p><p>
    
    While I was singing along to <em>Skylarking</em> and speculating over
    how many of my field hockey teammates would be able to justify
    rhinoplasty after suffering game-time facial injury, Kaia Wilson was
    teaming up with Donna Dresch to form Team Dresch in Portland, Oregon.
    Their album, <em>Personal Best</em>, garnered critical acclaim and earned
    Team Dresch the designation as one of the most outspoken and
    recognizable queer-core outfits. Wilson left Team Dresch shortly
    after their second release and moved to Durham, North Carolina, where
    she co-founded Mr. Lady and split her time between recording with the
    Butchies and putting out solo material.</p><p>
    
    Kaia's latest solo album, the largely acoustic, confessional
    <em>Oregon</em>, is an exemplary representation of the under-the-radar,
    user-friendly female folk-pop genre. I don't listen to a whole lot of
    this stuff, in part due to an irrational hatred of Ani Difranco (to
    whom Kaia bears some musical similarity) and all her friends, but
    this is a safe bet for anyone who's into that kind of thing.
    <em>Oregon</em> starts out with a sweet natured ode to-- I believe--
    Amelia Earhart, called ""World's Greatest Haircut.""  It's a fairly
    simple major-key acoustic number that builds gradually with broad
    harmonies and
    light piano.</p><p>
    
    The predominating theme here, if there is one, is loss. ""Mira""
    laments the early death of a friend with a country twang and the
    backing vocals of Indigo Girls' Amy Ray. In the same vein, ""Jasper""
    features harmonica and lyrics like, ""When Jasper left, he left for
    good.""  <em>Oregon</em> also features a significantly stripped down,
    acoustic Cure cover, ""Catch,"" and the jazzy ""Storm,"" which seems to
    be the most fully realized song on the album, both in structure and
    instrumentation.  ""Make Me Please"" is a great one-minute pop song
    played with drum machine and steel drum keyboard setting. This sounds
    weird-- and it is-- but I would have preferred more songs in this
    vein.</p><p>
    
    Kaia has a nice voice, an ear for integrating harmony, and a somewhat
    distinctive touch on the acoustic guitar. Lyrically, much of the
    album is somewhat self-absorbed and confessional, but that's the
    nature of the beast.  Kaia doesn't take a lot of risks, save for
    ""Make Me Please"" and the goofy new-age keyboards on ""Air.""
    <em>Oregon</em> is the kind of music you expect to hear while browsing
    in your local gynocentric bookstore, or wafting from the dorm windows
    of peasant-bloused, mooneyed, Birkenstock-ed college girls with
    really good skin.  It's nowhere near as distasteful as the vast
    majority of mainstream mopey girl music out there,but if you have to
    ask at this point if it rocks...well, no.</p><p>
    
    Not to speak pejoratively of our fair readers, but I suspect there
    are more than a few of you who shudder when I invoke the name of
    Lilith Fair. Likewise, I suspect if a Y-chromosoned rocker had
    released a nicely produced, adult contemporary folk rock solo album,
    I wouldn't even be writing this review. Kaia's back catalog as a
    member of both the Butchies and Team Dresch shows punk rock
    tendencies that don't really have a whole hell of a lot to do with
    this album. On the other hand, <em>Oregon</em> is a solid, well-written,
    well-executed release that probably deserves the attention of the
    legions of fans currently shelling out substantive sums of cash to
    attend Ani Difranco shows. Well done, for what it is.</p></div>"|4376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4376-oregon/|6.5|Alison Fields

    underground.  The Montreal native debuted last year as Jetone, releasing
    <em>Ultramarin</em> on the esteemed German imprint Force Inc. On that
    impressive record, Hecker put his unique stamp on minimal techno,
    creating nuanced tracks filled with depth and feeling in a genre that
    can seem clinical and emotionally remote. <em>Ultramarin</em> received
    a bit of notice, and then late last year, Hecker dropped the vastly
    different <em>Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again</em> under his own name on
    the Alien8 sub-label Substractif. Released almost six months ago at
    the time of this writing, <em>Haunt Me</em> made only the tiniest ripple
    in the electronic music press. A couple stingy hundred-word blurbs have
    been the extent of it.</p><p>
    
    But Hecker's pint-sized level of notoriety just ain't right, because
    <em>Haunt Me</em> is a hugely great album. Jettisoning the beats and
    club references of his work as Jetone, <em>Haunt Me</em> is a journey
    into abstract drones and cinematic atmosphere.  The sound fits squarely
    with what's happening in the laptop scene-- Fennesz, Janek Schafer and
    Microstoria are all valid reference points-- but once again, Hecker's
    approach is distinct. While these tracks never comment on traditional
    song forms in the manner of Fennesz' <em>Endless Summer</em>, they project
    a similar level of accessibility. The thick, meandering drones that
    permeate the record are shot through with seams of noise and static,
    but the dissonant elements are never off-putting.  <em>Haunt Me</em> is
    alien, amorphous and occasionally noisy, but always welcoming.</p><p>
    
    The photographs adorning the artwork of <em>Haunt Me</em> are of building
    roofs and telephone poles, but the pictures are framed in such a way
    that 95% of the image is sky. The sleeve design, oddly reminiscent of
    Modest Mouse's <em>The Lonesome Crowded West</em> (or, cover-wise, the
    Dismemberment Plan's <i>Change</i>), conveys an aspect of the music.
    Unlike the microscopic soundworld of someone like Jan Jelinek, Hecker's
    music seems designed for vast spaces, and the sound minutiae seems less
    important than the vibe of the whole. Keeping with the theme, Hecker's
    music, while celebrating open space, feels very isolated. Some tracks
    contain a melancholy edge that suggests loneliness; others hint at the
    healing power of solitary meditation. Either way, this is not an album
    for sharing-- you have to go it alone.</p><p>
<em>Haunt Me</em> is laid out beautifully.  Nine individually titled
    pieces are spread across twenty CD tracks, and the whole thing flows
    together as a long piece.  Befitting the music, this is a record for
    one sustained session. ""Music for Tundra"" takes up the first three
    tracks on the record, setting the mood with rumbling undercurrents of
    bass, a continual upper-register buzz, and unsteady synth chords that
    cut in unpredictably.  As it flows into ""Arctic Lovers Rock,"" a
    highly-processed pop song is woven into the sheets of sound.  Though
    the vocal treatment is more wistful than aggressive, the mood shifts
    drastically on ""The Work of Art in the Age of Cultural Overproduction.""
    This is where Hecker brings his harshest sounds, as deep bass throbs
    teeter on the edge of complete feedback and dense harmonics pack the
    high end.</p><p>
    
    ""October"" provides welcome relief, a peaceful amalgamation of synth
    drones that would sound great on a Kompakt <em>Pop Ambient</em>
    collection.  The tension begins to return on ""Ghost Writing,"" but
    this more reserved track, which combines gradually shifting sustained
    tones with the sounds of disembodied voices, could still work as
    background music. ""A City in Flames"" slowly builds in density, working
    with the same basic material, and the last several tracks wind down
    with spare, interweaving lines of drone that recall the first two
    albums by Stars of the Lid.  Each listen is deeply satisfying.
    <em>Haunt Me</em> is not a shift in paradigm, but it does explore this
    particular sound with taste and invention, and I wouldn't hesitate to
    place it on the top tier of current abstract electronic music.</p></div>"|3798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3798-haunt-me-haunt-me-do-it-again/|8.6|Mark Richard-San

    damn they're entertaining!  Every place I've lived in the lumpy
    American South has sustained a disproportionate number of tenured
    schizophrenics. Where I live now, on any given day-- in fact,
    <i>every</i> day-- one may spot some poor souls under compulsion to
    conduct counterintuitive acts in the streets, as if hexed into being
    involuntary performance artists. One fellow 'sieg-heils' at
    intersections. Another puts his head inside the Free Real Estate
    Guide dispenser and bellows, ""Bushels of wheat everywhere!""  One
    covers the city in magic marker formulas such as ""CBS minus HMO
    equals TAMPA.""  A man resembling Christopher Lloyd wraps his right
    arm in electrical tape and calls everyone ""Honeypardner.""  Asymmetrical
    women engage in heated arguments with themselves on every other public
    bench. Yesterday, a man grabbed my hand and tried in a series
    of abrupt tugs to drag me down the street with him, asking, ""I know
    you know me! Where my trees at? You going to get me some more trees,
    dawg?""  And just this morning, returning a book to the downtown library,
    I witnessed a screaming man trying to shake something only he could see
    out of a huge tree, like a live-action Bosch variation on the remote-island
    strandees of comics and cartoons.</p><p>
    
    To be a jerk and evaluate their suffering aesthetically, though, I
    find it odd that much of the personal mythologies of the schizophrenics
    I've met are really unoriginal.  Often, the sufferers just inflict upon
    themselves some conspiracy involving proper nouns from the three most
    obvious powers-at-hand: the government, the Bible, and-- strangest of all,
    I think-- pop culture.  I know a schizophrenic who posits that we all
    live in the Starship Enterprise, and another who believes that the world
    is controlled by the original MTV VJs.  Advocate for the mentally ill
    Ken Steele admits in his posthumous memoir <em>The Day the Voices Stopped</em>
    that TV and the radio tortured him the most, as demon voices would join
    in commercials, or the chorus of ""na-na-na-na, hey-hey-hey, goodbye.""
    Even pop genius Daniel Johnston's lore is populated by copywritten
    entities like Casper the Friendly Ghost and Captain America.</p><p>
    
    And who runs former Thirteenth Floor Elevator Roky Erickson's shadow
    government?  Silly B-movie monsters.  Roky isn't bothered by the fact
    that old movie monsters were bipedal failures of the imagination
    (ever consider what a true abomination of nature would look like?)
    with tacked-on social messages (venereal disease, puberty, nukes are
    bad).</p><p>
    
    Sympathy for the Record Industry is putting that White Stripes money
    to good use and re-releasing Roky's best post-breakdown album, offered
    in many forms and under many names since it was produced by Creedence
    bassist Stu Cook in 1980. You heard it here first: after Ron Howard's
    impish brother gets Jack Black to play Roky in the film <em>An Unbeautiful
    Mind</em>, this album will be huge, and showcased in a mega-display right
    beside <em>White Blood Cells</em> at your local Best Buy.</p><p>
    
    Accompanied by wailing, plasticky guitars and tight, propulsive
    drumming, a meth-sparked Roky warns his listeners of the monsters'
    power in a passionate, authoritative Texan drawl.  Inarguably strong
    hooks abound, whether Roky is running from the gut-throwing ""Creature
    with the Atom Brain"" or demanding that you ""Stand for the Fire Demon.""
    The atmospheric slo-momentum of ""Night of the Vampire"" even gives CCR's
    ""Bad Moon Rising"" a run for its blood money.  But the undisputed
    showstopper is ""I Think of Demons,"" a contagious love ballad on which
    Roky dedicates all of his Luciferian dialogues to a certain special
    someone: ""I think of demons-- [pause]-- for you."" Close on that killer
    track's heels is the uncanny ""I Walked with a Zombie,"" on which Roky
    and the band do a call-and-response affirmation of the fact that he
    and the undead co-stroll, which accumulates to some authentically
    stirring Caucasian doo-wop.</p><p>
    
    The bonuses on disc two (interviews, demos, rarities) are dandy, but
    the album is treasure enough. Its retro-metal chops have more kaboom
    than the irony-diluted pap of current poseurs, and its bent lyrics
    mop the floor with wannabe-kooks like Jad Fair.  Some savvy touches--
    such as Roky's progressive pre-PC designation that the swamp monsters
    are ""alligator-persons""-- hint that Roky was more lucid than he let
    on.  Maybe this record was his metaphorical way of communicating that
    he'd foreseen that the Reagan administration would reduce Americans
    to extras in a poorly acted horror film.</p><p>
    
    If you can get past Roky's benevolent-Manson persona and ignore the
    extratextual psychodrama, there's a lot of rock to love here--
    especially if you find yourself getting bonkers during the last hour
    of an interstate road trip.  <em>The Evil One</em> is a dashboard-pounding
    salve for those moments when the deer on the roadside start levitating
    and whispering backwards lullabies.</p></div>"|2827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2827-the-evil-one-plus-one/|8.0|William Bowers

    find yourself stuck in a Scottish pub waiting for the rain to stop.
    Just put a guitar in his hands, keep the pints coming, and I imagine
    he could entertain you all night with songs and stories.</p><p>
    
    Together with his band Appendix Out, Roberts has put out some of the
    best neo-folk in recent years, in the vein of Pentangle meets Palace,
    without sounding too ironic or revivalistic. But he does seem to have
    a vast supply of traditional songs and cover tunes haunting the
    recesses of his mind all the same. Last year, he released an album's
    worth of English and Scottish folk standards under his own name
    called <em>The Crook of My Arm</em>. This EP, <em>A Warm and Yeasty
    Corner</em>, gathers five covers under the full banner of Appendix
    Out.  While cynics may say this is just a time-stall tactic in lieu
    of new original material from the band, when the results are this
    good, bring it on!</p><p>
    
    The EP starts out with a song from Vashti Bunyan, a pastoral ballad
    called ""Window Over the Bay.""  Roberts' voice creaks and moans as if
    he's just returned from a long fishing voyage, and, together with the
    slow, rollicking pace of the song, the images of rest and contentment
    become heartbreakingly remote: the longing is palpable. In Bunyan's
    original, the song conveys a feeling of hippie idealism. Here it's
    much more forlorn, almost bleak. By the way, if your unfamiliar with
    Vashti Bunyan, by all means, seek her music out if you're a fan of
    Nick Drake-- and these days, who isn't?</p><p>
    
    ""Sally Free and Easy"" is next, a song written by English folky Cyril
    Tawny, who's best known for sea chanteys like this (and particularly
    for this very song). The version here is a fairly straight reading
    of the old tune featuring some lovely double bass and piano
    accompaniment.  Ewan Macoll's ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face""
    is mostly just piano and Roberts' voice. Within the world of British
    folk, covering Macoll is kinda like covering Dylan-- everyone does it.
    Hell, artists as diverse as the Pogues and Zamfir (master of the par
    flute!) have done it.  With that kind of range, you know a songwriter
    is touching on some deep, universal issues. The spare ambience
    created by this reading reminds me more of Bonnie Prince Billy's ""I
    See a Darkness"" each time I hear it.</p><p>
    
    Next is kind of the oddball of the bunch: The Magnetic Fields'
    ""Josephine."" By this point, it's high time for some sort of shift ir
    tone in the EP, and this song's postmodern wordings and distant orgar
    drone do the job.</p><p>
    
    But it's quickly back to 60s British folkies, with probably the most
    recognizable track rounding things out. The Incredible String Band's
    ""A Very Cellular Song"" (which has nothing to do with cell phones,
    unless those kids were far more visionary then I give them credit for)
    is a singalong number, with but with one verse and lasting 4\xBD minutes
    (though the original is something like twelve).  It provides the
    perfect coda for this small, heartfelt collection, as Roberts and
    the full cast sing, ""The pure light within you guide your way on.""</p><p>
<em>A Warm and Yeasty Corner</em> might not get you through the dark
    night of the soul, but it's enough to point you in the right direction.
    And at the very least, it's a fine way to kill some time as you wait
    for the storm to pass.</p></div>"|244.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/244-a-warm-and-yeasty-corner-ep/|7.4|Jason Nickey

If I'm found dead in a
    mangled car-wreck, you'll all know why:</p><p>
    
    From: Ryan Pitchfork<br/>
    126 W. Lake Shore Dr<br/>
    Chicago, IL 60601</p><p>
    
    To: George Tenet<br/>
    CIA Headquarters<br/>
    McLean, VA 22101</p><p>
    
    Dear Mr. Tenet,</p><p>
    
    Thank you for your May 3 memo (your ref. ""Pitchfork! I want some
    answers!"").  I can understand your concern in the matter of Luke
    Slater and his recent <em>Alright on Top</em> release. In this reply, I
    plan to outline for you my understanding of the situation, what led
    to its occurrence and what remedies I have already put in place to
    prevent it from happening again.</p><p>
    
    Allow me to briefly outline Pitchfork's engagement with Slater.
    First and foremost, I would like to state categorically that Slater
    has been one of Pitchfork's most effective operatives, domestic or
    overseas. Since joining the covert program, Slater has, until now,
    never failed to follow through on the program's directive, namely to
    offset and countermand hostile musical activities.  Ever since one
    of our field operatives discovered the fifteen-year-old Slater
    manipulating his Commodore 64's sound card, Pitchfork Covert
    Operations (PCO) has recognized Slater's value in the struggle
    against the menace of formulaic music.</p><p>
    
    In 1987, PCO sent Slater three truckloads of equipment and the back
    catalogs of Pitchfork-funded Detroit techno labels Transmat and
    Planet E.  With little instruction, Slater began to prove his worth.
    His first releases on the UK GPR label under his own name and as
    Morganistic more than met expectations.  With the unveiling of his
    Planetary Assault Systems project in 1992, PCO decided to maintain
    only a weather eye on Slater's activities. No one at PCO saw reason
    to monitor him any more heavily.  In fact, his multi-album deal with
    Mute's techno division, Novamute, confirmed that PCO could trust
    Slater to carry out his mission without constant supervision. I need
    not remind you that many Americans are alive and enjoying fine music
    today because of Slater's ambitious and innovative <em>Freek Funk</em>
    and <em>Wireless</em> albums.</p><p>
    
    When PCO's UK field office reported that Slater had communicated that
    his next album would be a slight change of direction and that he was
    introducing vocals, we saw no need to inquire any further. At the
    time, you will recall that PCO's budget was cut and POTUS had
    instructed you to ensure that something musically substantial should
    come out of his home state. If I may remind you, this confluence of
    events severely compromised PCO activities.</p><p>
    
    Not only was the operating budget slashed, but I had to divert 86% of
    what was left to guarantee the actualization of POTUS' executive
    order.  Do you know how much leave I had to cancel, how much
    mandatory overtime I had to insist upon in order to transform four
    Austin, TX douchebags into the cream of the indie rock nation?
    Hookwinking hipsters with a 10.0 isn't like falling off a log, sir.
    In short, <em>Source Tags and Codes</em> about crippled PCO. Something
    like <em>Alright on Top</em> was bound to happen.</p><p>
    
    At first glance, <em>Alright on Top</em> seems a viable proposition--
    Slater's UK spin on Motor City techno with vocals from Ricky Barrow,
    formerly of UK social-consciousness techno act The Aloof.  I think
    you'd agree that that the single and album opener, ""Nothing At All""
    pair up perfectly.  Barrow's mannered R&amp;B; moan is rendered all the
    more forcefulby Slater's relentless stomping techno funk.  But the
    subsequent tracks definitely warrant thorough investigation. For one,
    I want to know from where Slater acquired that blip kick drum,
    outlawed by UN treaty since the 1993 Culture Beat incident. Similar
    Euro pappy trance vibes occur throughout <em>Alright on Top</em>.
    Slater is content to make his songs as banal as possible, and Barrow
    is content to croon his moon-in-June type lyrics as if no one really
    cares.  Occasionally Slater takes on vocal duties and employs a
    vocoder, the use of which goes against internal PCO policy after the
    Cher debacle. But Slater's use of the device in no way contravenes
    international treaties. </p><p>
<em>Alright on Top</em> closes with (and I think you'll not deny this,
    sir) the unequivocal return-to-form ""Doctor of Divinity,"" which at
    least gives me hope for the future of Slater's activities. I share
    your concern over symbolically disguised messages in the cover art.
    It doesn't take a Hoover or a McCarthy to recognize that the
    Trimphone prominently featured on the cover is nothing less that an
    invitation to wayward former Soviet Bloc nations to contact Slater
    about possible double-agent activities.  Likewise, Slater's
    Rollerball costume proclaims his intent to go rogue. Remember Kim
    Philby? The British do have a track record of defecting and spilling
    the proverbial beans.</p><p>
    
    To prevent such a disaster, I have taken steps to insure that Slater
    stays within the PCO program and furthers its crucial aims. Though I
    foresee no improvement in PCO's budgetary constraints, I will divert
    funds from other projects.  Because the Trail of Dead project has
    successfully placed Texans at the top of the indie rock mountain
    (BTW, where was POTUS' acknowledgment or thank you card?) and PCO has
    contained the electroclash threat to just one section of Brooklyn, I
    have enough resources to guarantee the ongoing success of Slater and
    of the entire PCO.  Substandard music will one day be eradicated from
    this world. My loyal and devoted team and I are proud to be part of
    this war on artistic terrorism. God bless America!</p><p>

No, slower than that.  A little slower.  Okay,
    you're almost there, just a bit slower.  Right, now you're moving at
    roughly the same speed as Tram, one of the least propulsive rock acts
    in Britain I can think of.  Only once over the course of ten songs on
    their third album, <em>A Kind of Closure</em>, does the band even break
    80 bpm, on the relatively galloping ""Only Then.""</p><p>
    
    Of course, that's not necessarily a bad thing, though.  Low move at
    a snail's pace through everything they do and everybody loves them,
    right?  For their part, Tram take their slowcore approach very
    seriously, allowing the lush arrangements sitting on top of the
    barely-there drums and sparsely strummed guitars to draw you into
    their world.  Once you're there, Paul Anderson lies in wait with a
    veritable arsenal of downtrodden lyrics to bring you down, or,
    depending on your mood, simply put you to sleep.</p><p>
    
    Anderson's high, fragile voice manages to cut through even the
    densest music on the album, occasionally rising to a fey falsetto
    somewhat reminiscent of Geneva's Andrew Montgomery.  Of course, in
    this context, the word fragile simply refers to his tone, and not to
    his ability-- too often ""fragile"" is simply a word used to nicely say
    ""barely in tune,"" but Anderson's vocals have a genuine, glass-like
    clarity and vulnerability to them, especially when he nails those
    high notes.</p><p>
    
    Anderson and his partner, drummer Nick Avery, have managed to
    assemble a stronger batch of songs for <em>A Kind of Closure</em> than
    for either of their previous efforts, hitting their stride early with
    the trapped-in-ice loneliness of opener ""Three Years.""  All eyes are
    cast down as Anderson delivers tidbits like, ""Detected a joy/ He knew
    was a flaw,"" in a piercing falsetto before a solid piano part pulls him
    from the iceflow and onto the dry ground of the chorus.  That's followed
    by the more rhythmically inclined ""Forlorn Labour"" and the stark title
    track, which opens with the lines, ""There's a real lack of compassion in
    your voice/ As you tell me the news.""  The song builds to a stunning
    conclusion as an orchestral freezer blast of strings and horns carries
    you to the album's country-tinged and decidedly warmer midsection.</p><p>
    
    ""A Painful Education"" is laced with lazy fiddle and steel guitar, but
    it's one of the few songs that fails to really go anywhere, instead
    content to drag slowly along on an acoustic guitar base, without the
    benefit of Avery's percussion.  ""Forgive Me Dear"" fares much better
    with its soft fingerpicking and understated drums, using the steel
    more texturally and coloring the vocal with some very subtle Leslie.
    As strong as most of the vocal tracks are, though, two of the album's
    standouts are actually instrumentals-- the brief, horn-drenched
    ""Theme"" and the comparetively uptempo waltz ""The Hope Has Been Taken
    Away.""  The latter begins slowly, with just minimal guitar and muted
    trumpet, but the drums soon drag it lurching forward, strings
    swirling in the undertow.  The horns enter with close, dissonant
    voicings, recalling a slightly tamer version of second-LP Tindersticks.</p><p>
    
    The unfortunate thing for a band like Tram is that their appeal is
    likely to always be limited simply because of their chosen range of
    tempos.  And there are always moments where it gets somewhat
    tiresome-- at their sparsest, Tram fail to give off much steam, but
    for the most part there's enough going on to keep you invested.
    Based on their three albums so far, Tram are on an upward quality
    curve, which leaves a lot of hope that they might yet make a whole
    album full of the tension and stately grace that mark the best
    moments here.  For now, if you're looking for a quiet, slow album
    that's easy to spend a lot of time with, this one comes highly
    recommended.</p></div>"|8128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8128-a-kind-of-closure/|7.4|Joe Tangari

    the accordion.  My curiosity piqued, I craned my head slightly in his
    direction to hear how he'd justify his blanket disgust for all music
    produced by this one unfortunate instrument, and through a wall of
    half-chewed food he provided this: ""Cause, you know, it sounds like
    shit.""</p><p>
    
    ""That's it?"" I thought.  Surely there must be something deeper.  But
    as he and his friends went on talking, it became pretty clear that
    this guy didn't even really know what an accordion could do.  He
    seemed to limit its range solely to polka and romantic French guys on
    Paris street corners busking for change.  I'd wager dollars to donuts
    he's never really sat back and thought about the fact that the
    instrument does a lot more than that.  It shows up on Calexico albums
    playing ambient backdrops, and just today I heard a man playing one
    to such beautiful effect in Harvard Square that I actually stopped to
    listen for a bit and threw some change in his case.</p><p>
    
    My point is that this kid I overheard at lunch today really had no
    idea what he was talking about-- he was just relying on limited
    information to make a snap judgment on an instrument's capabilities.
    I didn't bother saying anything to him, but it got me thinking about
    all the great music that never would have been made if more people
    thought about musical instruments that way.  If Bartok had just stuck
    to writing for the violin the same way everyone before him had, we
    never would have had his amazing string quartets or ""Music for
    Strings, Percussion &amp; Celeste.""</p><p>
    
    Likewise for the steel-string acoustic guitar.  Though in most minds
    it was considered primarily for accompanying a singer or another
    instrumentalist, a trio of guitarists recording for the Takoma label
    changed all that in the early 60s.  Together, John Fahey, Robbie
    ""Basho"" Robinson, and Leo Kottke expanded the lexicon of the
    steel-stringed acoustic guitar well beyond what most people at the
    time could have imagined.  It was possible mostly because the three
    guitarists actively tried to expand their instrument's language and
    refused to recognize its perceived limitations.</p><p>
    
    This is where a young German named Steffen Basho Junghans comes in
    (you may recognize the Basho from the names above-- it's Junghans'
    tribute to his principal mentor).  On his second American release (he
    has several others in his homeland, though all are out of print),
    Junghans seems poised to take up the mantle established by those
    three all those years ago.  He approaches the acoustic guitar from
    every conceivable angle, milking its sonic capabilities for every
    last unique sound he can drag out of it, and the results are
    frequently stunning.</p><p>
    
    On <em>Waters in Azure</em>, Junghans builds on the precedent of his
    earlier works-- like <em>Song of the Earth</em>, which dealt with
    instrumental development of elemental themes: fire, air, earth, and
    water.  Here Junghans focuses on water only, crafting four pieces of
    solo guitar music that alternately flow freely, sit icy and static or
    envelop like a dense vapor.</p><p>
    
    His liner notes reference the three-part opening suite ""Water"" as a
    rumination on the different characteristics of water, and what at
    first sounds remarkably pretentious actually turns out to be somewhat
    accurate.  Playing a 12-string guitar with a slide, he moves between
    slippery portamentos, odd fret noise and rapid tremolo picking
    easily, putting his unique slide technique on full display.
    Beginning quietly, as though mimicking the approach of a rainstorm,
    the piece slowly creeps in, before Junghans drops in unexpectedly
    violent plucks that seem to represent splashes in puddles.</p><p>
    
    ""Outside the Rain"" finds Junghans exploring percussive tapping, as
    well as offering lush, more traditional-sounding harmonic ideas,
    albeit played in a highly unconventional tuning.  Its free-flowing,
    organic beauty makes it the album's best piece-- the strumming and
    chords are subtle, but his hard attack gives the composition a
    rhythmic surge seemingly at odds with that subtlety.  That duality
    makes for a thoroughly engaging listen.</p><p>
    
    The two pieces for six-string guitar, ""One No1"" and ""Azure No1"" are
    both textural studies, the former creeping quietly from movement to
    movement on a minimal structure, while the latter at first sounds as
    though your CD player is skipping.  The approach to the second piece
    actually has more in common with Steve Reich's phase music pieces
    than it does with anything that ever came out on Takoma.  </p><p>
    
    The only unfortunate thing about this album is that it occasionally
    has a tendency to drag.  As an ambient background for whatever
    happens to be consuming your time, it's really never objectionable at
    all, but in terms of active listening, certain passages can become a
    bit tiresome, mostly due to their intense repetition.  The second
    movement of ""Waters"" and ""Azure No1"" particularly suffer from that.
    Overall, though, it's an intriguing, sometimes beguiling work from a
    promising talent who I hope we'll hear a lot more from in the
    future.</p></div>"|4316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4316-waters-in-azure/|7.5|Joe Tangari

    imagine appropriate.  It has to do with their approach: rather than
    adhere to strict minimalism, the trio come across as humble craftsmen
    content to make quiet music.  Like Kranky labelmates Stars of the Lid
    and Low, they've always been amenable to collaborations, and side
    projects like Aix Em Klemm and Pan American have been just as
    rewarding.  The latter is a personal favorite, probably because
    Labradford guitarist Mark Nelson has chosen to explore more
    electronic areas.  Pan American's last release, <em>360 Business/360
    Bypass</em>, was a dense, beautiful record, colored on two tracks by
    Rob Mazurek's cornet.  Nelson reached a particular peak with ""Code,""
    a gently-drifting pulsecloud paired with vocals from Mimi Parker and
    Alan Sparhawk of Low.</p><p>
    
    Nelson's newest, <em>The River Made No Sound</em>, is very sparse in
    comparison.  ""Plains"" begins with a treated piano tracing its steps
    in the darkness.  The path converges on itself, quickening in time as
    patches of white noise appear, but little else happens.  It's a
    performance that's repeated two songs later, except the plinks become
    waves of sound, and the hubbub of a muted crowd sample intensifies
    the feeling of isolation.  There's an unmistakably clinical tone to
    these pieces, a sense that the basic pattern followed by the notes
    will not deviate from course.  It's a feeling that pervades
    throughout the album-- there's something too smooth about this pretty
    mood music.</p><p>
    
    ""For a Running Dog"" might actually be a bit of a Pavlovian behavioral
    test.  It kicks in with the generic micro-house pads that labels like
    Kompakt have been treating as their doormat calling-card.  Nelson
    pours warm reverb over the frame, and not much changes for the next
    eight minutes.  The constant thuds have a nice hypnotic effect, of
    course, but there's zero variation and it quickly gets dull.  There's
    more going on in ""Red Line,"" from the faint locomotive chugging to
    the high-pitched guitar noodling.  The expected glitch tick pumps in,
    though, and nine minutes pass in monotony.</p><p>
    
    Obviously, the tactic is to draw attention as much to the space
    between the beats as the actual sounds themselves.  Like the illusion
    that occurs on a grid, where the eye sees black squares on the white
    lines that intersect, the listener realizes a sort of inverse rhythm.
    The problem is that the negative space opened up on <em>The River Made
    No Sound</em> is occasionally interesting but really not all that
    worthy of your attention.  Artists like Nurse With Wound and John Zorn
    have done incredible things with the tension underlying these
    relationships, but Pan American seem to falter here.  You find
    yourself waiting for surprises.  They occur only occasionally, as on
    ""Raised Wall,"" which dispels the constancy of ""Red Line"" with a flux
    of samples and distortion a la Oval.</p><p>
    
    ""St. Cloud"" exemplifies the progressive flow that we want: marbles
    roll scattershot across the speakers, and the bass rumbles a little
    later in each passing measure.  Unfortunately, unless you have one of
    those air-traffic-control-type headphones, you're only going to hear
    it well on your home speakers.  Another strike: this album won't
    sound good on little earbuds.  The low rating isn't to suggest that
    the music here is necessarily bad, just that it's disappointingly
    average.  There's little that distinguishes itself, and the 4/4 thump
    dominates the mix and too often grounds the ethereal elements that
    should be set free.  The bass isn't as sexy as the throbbing dub of
    Berlin's Rhythm &amp; Sound, nor as brilliantly paranoiac and confining
    as Plastikman's <em>Consumed</em>.  <em>The River Made No Sound</em>:
    movement without evidence.  It's a clear summation, but it doesn't
    make for very compelling music.</p></div>"|6129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6129-the-river-made-no-sound/|5.8|Will Bryant

I
    care about you.  (Well, most of you.)  So I'll be honest.  Rock isn't
    always pretty, but sometimes that's just the way it's gotta be.
    Believe me, then, when I say that Rye Coalition's new album, <em>On
    Top</em>, is downright ugly, but rocks like it's about to go out of
    style.  So all of you who just want another pretty face can stick to
    the safety of The Strokes and Weezer.  In the meantime, Rye Coalition
    is gonna be busy defining arena-ready indie rock without any pretty-boy
    theatrics, so get out of the way or be crushed underfoot.</p><p>
<em>On Top</em> is so relentlessly energetic that from the moment Rye
    Coalition begins to stomp and bruise their way through the album, no
    one stands a chance.  Once they get moving, all you can do is be
    dragged through the mud behind them.  By the time the album ends,
    you're filthy, the wind has been knocked out of you and your organs
    hurt from the impact, but, like Loverboy, you've loved every minute
    of it.  The only 'break' to be found is on the bluesy ""Freshly
    Frankness,"" which wouldn't exactly sound out of place on <em>White
    Blood Cells</em>-- if, uh, Jack White took steroids.</p><p>
    
    But before I forget, the lyrics suck big time.  If they're tongue-in-cheek,
    Ralph Cuseglio's delivery is too straight-faced to let on.  Don't worry
    too much, though, since lyrics only matter if you can understand them--
    which in this case you can't.  (Just don't open the liners and you'll
    be fine.)  Cuseglio spits and froths his way through every song with
    such manic adrenaline that he must be hooked to some kind of goddamn
    rock and roll I.V.  And for their part, the rest of the band matches
    him, with jagged guitar lines dominating and kicking like a gas-powered
    mule (you heard me).  On the rare occasions when Justin Morrey's bass
    is able to bust through the mix, I can hear Shellac-- and I probably
    don't need to tell you, but that's a good thing.</p><p>
    
    Now, this is a pretty straightforward album, so the possibilities do
    exhaust themselves somewhat by the end; there's only so much that can
    be done with this sort of visceral, no-frills rock.  But just as doubts
    regarding this album's staying power creep in, the showpiece closer,
    ""Honky, Please,"" shatters them Conan-style.  The track is immediately
    set apart by the awkward opening sounds of seagulls and a garbage truck
    in reverse gear, before it launches into a menacing guitar riff.  The
    instrumentation builds, collapses under its own weight, then resurges
    with such a massively gut-wrenching crescendo that nothing can follow it.
    So nothing does.</p><p>
    
    Rye Coalition may not be what anyone had in mind when rock and roll
    was developed, but that's only because they weren't thinking hard
    enough.  Did I mention the record was engineered by Steve Albini?
    If you don't take my word for it, at least trust Steve not to steer
    you wrong.  Steve says, ""<em>On Top</em> is a juggernaut of an album.""
    Believe it, kids.</p></div>"|6883.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6883-on-top/|8.2|Eric Carr

Their bandname comes from the first
    letters of their last names, and their album cover shows three
    slightly slouching skeletons all decked out in a green glow.  Their
    album is a proclamation about just how tight a band can get.  By
    wielding sax (Gabe Andruzzi), drums (Josh Blair), and accordion (Pete
    Cafarella), ABCS deftly flaunt their skills by dealing in abrupt time
    changes, start and stop progressions, and a heavy mixture of solo,
    duet and trio work while remaining almost entirely outside of any
    obvious rock context.</p><p>
    
    The unity demonstrated throughout the six songs on <em>ABCS</em> relies
    on the band's incorporation of strange instrumentation.  An accordion
    is yanked out of its usual Germanic setting and thrust into a punk
    rock Terry Riley/Phil Glass jam that references polka, ska, and Pauline
    Oliveros.  The sax, which sticks more strictly to its typical jazz
    context and occasionally adds breathy, ambient elements, is constantly
    yelling across the room at the other instruments, ignoring their rabid
    retorts.</p><p>
    
    This album is the ABCS' debut release, and it shines with all the
    enthusiasm of anything new.  It starts on an up note, kicking through
    the door and screaming, and doesn't stop pushing until the whole
    fucking mess grinds to a halt.  It's mesmerizing and, oddly, very
    fresh sounding: though obviously informed by a variety of styles and
    philosophies, ABCS manage to avoid getting stuck on any of them.</p><p>
    
    And there's where ABCs really transcend their contemporaries: transition.
    The best improvisers are those who can shuffle in and out of various
    modes while remaining on all the time.  These guys benefit from the
    same skills by keeping things dynamic, yet recognizable.  And because
    they'll continue to play with each other in a way that is truly <i>with</i>
    each other, liberally using alchemy and accordion to accomplish their
    tasks, the album stands as a true testament to 1 + 1 + 1 = 1.</p></div>"|10.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10-abcs/|8.0|Michael Bernstein

He wrote before about Nobukazu
    Takemura, saying something about hearing an amazing track in concert
    that wasn't on any of the man's records. Now he tells me that this
    track is on the new EP, and wonders if I've heard it. I haven't. I
    didn't even know there <em>was</em> a new EP, somehow.  I pull out my
    wallet and fish for the credit card while surfing over to
    thrilljockey.com. I find the record in question, something called
    <em>Mimic Robot</em>. A couple of clicks later and it's on its way.</p><p>
    
    It arrives in four days, incredibly. When I ordered Mouse on Mars'
    <em>Instrumentals</em> back when it was vinyl-only, it took them a
    month to get it to me. <em>Mimic Robot</em> has a beautiful pink cover,
    with a small graphic of a robot getting all 'two turntables and a
    microphone' in the lower right corner.  It has four tracks, and I
    don't recognize any titles.</p><p>
    
    The first is ""Mimic Robot (12-inch Single Mix)."" This tells me that
    this track will be found on the next Takemura full-length in
    pared-down form, just like the vinyl-only <i>Sign</i> EP that preceded
    <em>Hoshi No Koe</em>. It's not too terribly far from ""Sign"" or
    ""Meteor,"" in that it's upbeat, with prominent vocoder.  But ""Mimic
    Robot"" is much sparer than Takemura's recent pop work, with just an
    acoustic bass sample, some flailing drum hits, and the familiar
    voice. I like it better than ""Sign,"" because the Nintendo palate
    saturation of the latter gets old after a while. There are hints of
    that here, but ""Mimic Robot"" is much subtler and more effective.</p><p>
    
    Next is ""Cons (Plant Mix).""This simple piece is one the latest in
    what's become very long line of Takemura CD-skip tracks. There's
    almost nothing to it, just one note on synthesizer chopped into
    pieces and repeated for several minutes.  It still works for me,
    somehow, but to me the CD skip has become sentimental, invoking
    emotion as dependably as lap steel does for a country music devotee.
    And that's the warmth that Takemura always brings to this shopworn
    technique. If you say it's boring as shit, I won't argue.</p><p>
    
    Side B starts with a major disappointment: a track called ""Resign
    Part 2"" that's actually yet another mix of ""Sign."" I like that song
    just fine, but this is my fourth version, including the twelve-inch
    version and an a capella mix on the original EP, plus the single mix
    included on the full-length. I don't need another, even if this is a
    serious reworking. Most of the busy midrange is jettisoned, leaving
    space for deeper, gurglier beats.</p><p>
    
    Finally comes the track that brought this EP to my door, the one that
    Ross heard Takemura doing live. It's called ""Lost Treasure"" and it
    again samples an acoustic bass, but the tempo is relaxed and the
    beats are hip-hop in Toyland style. Another voice through vocoder
    doesn't so much sing as scat, with unrecognizable words tumbling in
    unpredictable clusters. This is as stripped-down as Takemura has ever
    been in a pop context, with room enough for a all sorts of weird
    noises to pass through, rounded out by a couple vibe solos.  I like
    it, but not quite as much as the title track.  And it falls prey to
    Takemura's greatest weakness-- his inability to end a track at the
    appropriate time and leave the listener wanting more. Still, here's
    an EP that's got me back in Takemura mode, looking through release
    dates for the next full-length.  Thanks, Ross.</p></div>"|7921.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7921-mimic-robot-ep/|7.0|Mark Richard-San

It's hard to say what it is exactly-- you know it
    when you hear it, and that's about all you can say. The Rokys, Syds,
    and Skips, the Jandeks, Johnstons, and er, Shaggs of the musical
    universe.  Artists with inner visions that, when squeaked out into the
    world, were generally met with amusement if by anything at all.  But
    there's something that unites them, and it's not just weirdness. For
    example, a lot of mainstream artists are <i>absurdly</i> weird, yet
    clearly not outsiders.  Like, say, Tenacious D.</p><p>
    
    No, there's something more elusive to the whole outsider music
    phenomenon.  It's a kind of hopeless, isolating weirdness, and above
    all, a mystique surrounding both the music and the musician.  Irwin
    Chusid, author of <em>Songs in the Key of X</em> and perhaps the leading
    authority on the subject, says the defining quality of outsider music
    is that it inevitably raises the question, ""What were they thinking?""
    As good a definition as any, I'd say.</p><p>
    
    Which brings me to Brother JT.  Why would someone want to create
    faux-outsider rock?  Simply, because it's easy.  You just act all
    strange for a really long time, build yourself a cult following, and
    before you know it, you're an outsider. It may not be lucrative, but
    it's an easy path for the relatively unambitious to achieve some minor
    notoriety, and maybe even an occasional free drink down at the local
    watering hole.</p><p>
    
    Brother JT has been doing this a long time, so he's well on his way.
    Somewhat of an elder guru in the so-called Psychedelphia scene,
    JT's <em>Maybe We Should Take Some More?</em> is something like
    his fifth full-length. Before going solo he played in the garage
    group The Original Sins and he often hooks up with fellow Philly
    scenesters Vibrolux to make some noise.</p><p>
    
    On the surface, <em>Maybe We Should Take Some More?</em> is a fairly
    decent album. You got your acid-fractured folk of the Skip
    Spence/Roky Erickson variety, your feedback freakouts, and your
    distant, barely audible muttering filling in the gaps between songs:
    all the basic trappings of an 'out there' album.  And, yeah, it's
    pretty weird, even a little disturbing if you can turn off your internal
    critic and just kind of go with it.  Apparently, that's what Brother JT
    is counting on, because if you pay much attention to it at all, <em>Maybe
    We Should Take Some More?</em> reeks of premeditation, like a calculated
    attempt to weird you out.</p><p>
    
    Before you even get to the music there's the album title, the smeared
    cover shot, and songs titles like ""Jesus Guitar/1st Thoughts"" to clue
    you in that this is drug music.  And after listening, it's clear that
    the good brother and his pals think we should be, like, really
    freaked out by all the drug references and drug-like imagery and,
    like, all these trippy sounds, dude.  But the album lays all of its
    cards on the table, then expects you to be intrigued.  Where's the
    hell's the mystery?</p><p>
    
    There are some highlights, the best of which is ""Whatcha Gonna Do?""
    which asks the timeless question, ""Whatcha gonna do when there's
    nothing left to do?"" complete with a guttural blast of feedback and
    hilarious frog-croak samples punctuating the percussion. It's a
    great song that pulls you in multiple directions, both humorous and
    sinister, without making much of a to-do about itself. In short,
    pure mystery.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, there aren't many moments like this one on the album.
    It so obviously longs to be canonized alongside the work of such
    American originals as Spence, Erickson and co., yet so much of it
    just sits at the 'pleasant' level, leading me to believe maybe
    those involved took <em>too</em> much, got the munchies, and then
    went for burritos instead of pushing themselves creatively. I almost
    think that more downright obnoxious moments would help this album.
    At least then I might ask myself, ""What were they thinking?""  As it
    stands, the answer is all too obvious.</p></div>"|962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/962-maybe-we-should-take-some-more/|5.9|Jason Nickey

    behavior on the rise.  No, not priests diddling young parishoners-- they've
    known about that for ages.  <i>This</i> unspeakable scourge is called
    techno-eroticism, a term loosely defined as an inappropriate romantic
    relations with mechanical objects.  In a pornographic underworld too seedy
    and secret for even Nicolas Cage to penetrate, there are men and women who
    will stop at nothing to perform hideous and twisted acts against helpless
    appliances and electronic devices.  Yes, I know.</p><p>
    
    Is John Vanderslice a part of this perverted culture?  The evidence is
    inconclusive at this hour, but ""Me and My 424,"" a song from his latest
    outing, <em>Life and Death of an American Fourtracker</em>, certainly has
    its implications.  Not since Queen drummer Roger Taylor's ode to autophilia
    (""I'm in Love with My Car"") has a more overt display of man-machine love
    been foisted on the general public.  Heart aflutter over his Tascam
    Portastudio 424 four-track recorder, Vanderslice lustfully fetishizes the
    spare parts he hoards in case it breaks down, adding and subtracting tracks,
    and his boxes upon boxes of TDKs.  Freak.</p><p>
    
    Yet despite Vanderslice's shameless display of techno-erotic infatuation,
    it can at least be said that he and his recording equipment make
    beautiful music together: ""Me and My 424"" is the most infectious song
    about (cough cough) 'alternative lifestyles' since ""Lola.""   Though
    he's often mistaken for the New York Yankees' right fielder or the
    star of <em>Dawson's Creek</em>, Vanderslice is in fact known primarily
    as the man behind Tiny Telephone studios in San Francisco, where a
    number of your favorite bands have recorded.  But he's no stranger to
    the other side of the soundproof studio glass, having done the cult band
    thing with MK Ultra in the nineties before going it solo in the aughts.</p><p>
    
    Thus far, Vanderslice's solo work has occasionally suffered from that
    common pitfall of producer/musicians-- the tendency to drift away
    from actual songs towards sound experiments and unnecessarily fancy
    arrangements.  Not so with <em>Fourtracker</em>, which largely finds
    its creator emphasizing his ear for a snappy melody over his desire
    to advertise the studio.  The adjustment allows Vanderslice to serve
    up his thickest, juiciest slabs of honey-baked pop yet, under the
    umbrella of a concept album lyrically expanding on the teenage
    melodrama and aquatic imagery of The Who's ""Drowned.""</p><p>
    
    Placing songwriting at the top of his priority list doesn't mean
    Vanderslice gives his compositions sparse environs-- he still throws
    a veritable encyclopedia of sounds at each and every track.  This
    time around, the wide instrumentation accentuates, rather than
    distracts from, the central melody-- ""The Apartment"" builds
    from simple piano and acoustic guitar to big brassy peaks, while
    melancholy violin and cello temper the bouncy strut of ""Fiend in a
    Cloud.""  Vanderslice excels at picking just the right sonic
    ingredients to evoke a particular mood, be it the Hawaiian steel
    guitar that lends ""From Out Here"" its hazy beach feel, or the terse
    clash of swooping strings and drumming that lends ""Me and My 424""
    its tone of romantic desperation.</p><p>
    
    Of course, it never hurts to have some famous friends to spruce up
    the liner notes, and here Vanderslice drafts Death Cab's cabbie,
    Spoon's stickman, a Mate of State and a Mountain Goat to do the
    honors.  However, most of the contributions are pretty subtle: Ben
    Gibbard implicates himself in the techno-erotic world by lending his
    vocal and guitar to ""Me and My 424,"" Kori Gardner Hammel throws in
    harmony on ""Nikki Oh Nikki."" John Darnielle pens a couple (surprisingly
    unremarkable) lyrics.  Only Spoon's skinsmeister Jim Eno leaves much
    of a divot, having a ball inside Vanderslice's crunchy drum sound on
    ""Fiend in a Cloud"" and ""From Out Here."" </p><p>
    
    In fact, Eno's and Gavin Foster's drumwork plays a considerable role
    in keeping <em>Fourtracker</em> afloat, as evidenced by the unsatisfying
    results when Vanderslice turns to less traditional sources of rhythm.
    The percussion loop on ""Nikki Oh Nikki,"" comprised of coin-filled bags
    and cresting waves, can't shake its resemblance to Pink Floyd's ""Money,""
    cycling endlessly like a funeral dirge and sedating Gardner Hammel's
    characteristically spunky singing.  And ""Amitriptyline"" lacks the
    energy to overcome its clunky pharmaceutical subject matter, limping
    along on a nondescript synthesizer preset.</p><p>
    
    But despite the soggy middle that those two songs constitute, the album
    stands strong alongside its quality button-down pop peers at Barsuk
    Records.  <i>Life and Death of an American Fourtracker</i> finds John
    Vanderslice taking firm steps towards balancing both his producin' and
    his writin' personas.  He's not quite there yet, but he's darn close.
    And he lives in California, where it's still legal to 'fuck around'
    with a four-track, if that's his bag.  John, just keep it safe and use
    lots of head cleaner.</p></div>"|8402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8402-life-and-death-of-an-american-fourtracker/|7.9|Rob Mitchum

    tireless improviser Rob Mazurek. The contents are, without question, less
    structured than anything we've heard from Isotope 217 or any of Mazurek's
    Chicago Underground projects. They are also, for better or for worse,
    befitting of the term ""ambient.""  These works, like many moments or
    Chicago Underground releases, fall very easily into the background.
    They stand out enough to vaguely alter the mood of a room, but dynamically,
    they're mostly too static to ever really grab your attention.  Unlike the
    Chicago Underground projects which are known to wander from noise to jazz,
    and ambient to funky in the period of one ten minute song, this disc stakes
    its claim firmly in ambient territory, and stays there.</p><p>
    
    At its best, solo improvisation can be an amazing display of a
    brilliant mind at work-- as Fred Frith put it, ""a continuous dialogue
    with the unexpected.""  At its worst, it can leave an otherwise able
    musician devoid of any structure or ideas. Well aware of the nature
    of this two-faced beast, Mazurek has recruited a bunch of the usual
    suspects to, y'know, hang around the studio and do stuff. The Sea and
    Cake's Sam Prekop lends some lazy guitar pickings to ""Time Coded
    Single,"" while Mazurek noodles about with a piano.  Isotope 217's
    Matthew Lux creates a backdrop of noise for Mazurek's signature
    cornet sound on ""Strange Logics.""</p><p>
    
    ""The Shaping Light"" features a Chicago scenester sextet which
    includes Ken Brown, John Herndon and Casey Rice.  Mazurek's cornet
    dominates the first few minutes, though soon all that's left is
    post-delay residue that swirls gently around Tania Bower's vocals.
    She never sings anything in particular, but her voice is lush enough
    that it much doesn't matter-- at least not until it too falls under the
    control of that conniving laptop. Soon, glitched-out vocal chunks
    are fitting themselves into chopped up horn, Lux's bass, and orgar
    before Mazurek and his pure, unaffected horn take the fore once
    again.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, the guest contributions are minimal, if not indistinguishable.
    Most of the sounds on <em>Amorphic Winged</em> come from Mazurek and his
    laptop. This is the second solo album from Rob and his laptop in the
    last year, the first being a minimal laptop-only musique concréte
    project on Drag City entitled <em>Orton Socket</em>.  <em>Winged Amorphic</em>
    sees Mazurek attempting to marry the weird clicks and pops of that album
    with the sound he's generally known for.</p><p>
    
    As such, the computer plays a larger role here than on most of his
    records. Most of the pieces on <em>Amorphic Winged</em> consist largely
    of cornet, piano or other such familiar noises being run through
    patches and effects. ""Steel Cut Oak"" is built around a recording of a
    piano playing backwards (cool at first, though after nearly twenty
    minutes, it gets old). ""Clouded Rooms"" is a short number that might
    as well be called ""If I Fuck With It Enough, You Won't Be Able to
    Tell What Sound Source I'm Using.""  (It's more fun than it sounds.)</p><p>
    
    If any of this sounds familiar, it's probably because a lot of these
    are essentially the same approaches and techniques Mazurek has beer
    sprinkling throughout most of his recent work. This isn't a bad
    thing, per se; much like the Chicago Underground Duo's most recent
    outing, <em>Amorphic Winged</em> is easy on the ears from start to
    finish.  The problem is that, at times, it may be a bit <i>too</i>
    easy.  So much of this album is like the calm-before-the-storm dynamic
    of a Chicago Underground piece, that I often find myself waiting for a
    dramatic climax that never comes.</p><p>
    
    Mazurek's greatest strength is often the patience and understanding
    he has toward other musicians.  It makes sense: some friends stopped
    by, but they didn't stay too long, leaving Mazurek's sound to float
    this way and that, without much to hang onto. Still, if you're into
    the Chicago jazz sound and the stuff-running-through-computer-patches
    sound, you'll probably find something to like here.</p></div>"|5168.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5168-amorphic-winged/|7.0|David M. Pecoraro

    pundit wrote that Bob Dylan's ""still got it,"" that Bruce Springsteen's late-90s
    social posturing is any more convincing than his Reagan-era material, that
    the small army of background singers and synthesizers required to create Brian
    Wilson's <em>Imagination</em> really sound any fresher than, say, ""Kokomo.""
    For the last seven or eight years, Elvis Costello fans have had great reason
    for concern.</p><p>
    
    After a stellar showing with the reunited Attractions on 1994's <em>Brutal
    Youth</em>, Costello released a trio of disappointing releases. 1996's <em>All
    This Useless Beauty</em> barely used the Attractions, wandering in several
    different directions at once and recycling material originally written for
    other artists.  1998's Burt Bacharach collaboration <em>Painted from Memory</em>
    seemingly aged Costello an extra twenty years, with its preponderance of crooning
    ballads and arrangements that might as well have been recorded for a Dionne
    Warwick comeback.  And last year's pairing with Anne Sofie von Otter, <em>For
    the Stars</em>, barely qualified as a Costello release at all, with a predilection
    for Costello's iffiest material (""Shamed into Love,"" anyone?) and a pair of Tom
    Waits' more forgettable castoffs.</p><p>
<em>When I Was Cruel</em>, happily, finds Costello tuning his compass with two
    excellent reference points: his 1986 masterwork <em>Blood and Chocolate</em> and
    the eclectic showmanship of 1989's <em>Spike</em>. Once again, Costello drafts
    Attractions Steve Nieve and Pete Thomas into the fold, but with a breath of
    fresh air in the form of Cracker's Davey Faragher on bass.  Costello harnesses
    some of his <em>Useless Beauty</em> period's greatest strengths-- the wet
    percussion from Tricky's remix of ""Little Atoms,"" for instance, and the tremolo
    guitar that dominated ""Complicated Shadows""-- to give his new compositions a
    contemporary edge while anchoring the music to the ragged, rough-edged guitar
    sound that's been the signature of Costello's best work.</p><p>
    
    The result is an immediately engrossing and challenging collection of moody,
    evocative songs-- an entire album of ""I Want You"" and ""Watching the Detectives""
    for those so inclined.  The cinematic noir of ""When I Was Cruel No. 2,"" with
    its point-of-view narration and looped female vocal, plays like the torch song
    from some as-yet unmade David Lynch film-- <em>Twin Peaks</em> meets Portishead
    in a smoky Italian nightclub.  The faux-Beat rhythms of ""Dust"" and outright
    scat on the jazz-damaged ""Episode of Blonde"" succeed both as prose and dramatic
    bits of music, easily upstaging Tom Waits' hit-and-miss homages to Kerouac and
    Ginsberg.</p><p>
    
    The balls-out rock textures of <em>Blood and Chocolate</em> are re-explored on
    ""Tear Off Your Own Head (It's a Doll Revolution),"" with its thick guitar hooks
    and powerful blasts of cleverly flanged bass, and ""My Blue Window,"" a cheeky
    nod to <em>Blood and Chocolate</em>'s ""Blue Chair.""  The guitar-driven ""Daddy Can
    I Turn This"" and the meaty, dissonant ""Dissolve"" are Costello-by-the-numbers,
    tightly wound pop gems that seem to spring painlessly from Costello's loins
    when he's on a roll.</p><p>
    
    But it's the more experimental pieces on <em>When I Was Cruel</em> that are the
    most consistently rewarding.  The percolating rhythms and locomotive bass on
    ""Spooky Girlfriend,"" augmented by horns and tight background harmonies, almost
    sound like Costello backed by <em>Oranges and Lemons</em>-era XTC.  Likewise with
    the complicated pastiche of programmed beats, organ and horns on ""15 Petals,""
    a confident and infectious detour into Latin rhythms (think Tito Puente, not
    Ricky Martin).  The measured swells of backwards guitar and deep bass hits on
    closer ""Radio Silence"" send <em>When I Was Cruel</em> out on an optimistic note--
    for the future of music and for Costello's own relevance in the post-modern
    blipscape of <em>Kid A</em> and <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em>.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps <em>When I Was Cruel</em>'s sweetest punch is that, at 47, Costello sounds
    pretty much exactly as he did at 27.  Unlike Dylan, Springsteen, Wilson, or
    Waits-- or, god knows, Lou Reed-- he hasn't had to compromise his music to fit
    his aging pipes.  Costello's at his most entertaining when he cleverly sidesteps
    an issue rather than confronting it head on, as on the slight misfire of ""45,""
    which makes the trite connection between Costello's age and the number of
    revolutions per minute made by a hit record.</p><p>
    
    Faragher's hyperactive bass proves a savvy addition to Nieve's blasting organ
    and noodling piano, Thomas' busy rhythms, and Costello's spy-film guitar riffs.
    Some of Costello's most interesting work has been fatally injured by poor
    chemistry; <em>When I Was Cruel</em> is a self-confident return to form-- sharp,
    solid and, though Costello should have nothing to prove-- completely relevant.</p></div>"|1614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1614-when-i-was-cruel/|8.0|Will Bryant

Sometimes, Dischord Records just seems like a
    wacky, dysfunctional family-- despite the understanding and
    benevolent leadership of its flagship band, the youngsters bristle
    and either fly away to more lucrative record deals or fizzle out with
    little in the way of Epitaph. Fugazi travels with undeniable clout.
    You just don't mess with them. And it's hard for younger bands to
    avoid getting caught up in vicarious charisma and stand with any sort
    of equal footing in the greater musical community. I believe
    whole-heartedly that this is unintentional, but the subliminal message
    is: don't even try it.  The plight of the metaphorical Dischord scions
    is pretty much equal to that of any celebrity child. It's an uphill
    battle-- not only to prove your worth, but to prove your worth
    relative to Fugazi.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps it was a deep sense of foreboding that kept the Capitol
    City Dusters at bay for almost four years. Their last album,
    <em>Simplicity</em>, received scant critical praise-- though it must
    have sold well, because it can be found in almost every used bin
    across this crazy land.  Still, the album garnered them enough
    attention that any band name involving the word 'Dusters' got
    scratched off potential bandname lists in garages nationwide.</p><p>
    
    And the Capitol City Dusters sound like a good idea, in theory. Alec
    Bourgeois (guitarist/vocalist from Severin), Benjamin Azzara (original
    drummer of the Delta 72), and at least two sort of recognizable bass
    players before the current Jesse Quitslund (of the Vile Cherubs) are
    all devoted to bringing the rock in a way only D.C. bands with ties
    to Dischord can bring the rock.  In short, they're light on the
    debauchery, heavy on the angular riffs.</p><p>
    
    Does it sound like Fugazi?  Well, yes, sort of. You can hear the
    influence-- in fact, you can't escape the influence. The first track,
    ""Superimposed,"" starts out sounding like an <em>In on the Kill
    Taker</em> reject, complete with driving single-note guitar, creative
    drumming and Ian-esque vocals.  The sudden onslaught of guitars at
    the chorus sounds suspiciously recognizable.  On the other hand, in
    an attempt to distance themselves from their obvious influences, the
    Dusters throw in some really weird structural effects. Halfway
    through ""Superimposed,"" the song morphs into jangly R.E.M.-sounding
    alterna-pop (even down to Bourgeois' voice, which sounds eerily like
    Michael Stipe).  From this point on, the album pretty much vacillates
    between the poppy vein, with recognizable 1-4-5 major-key chord
    progressions, sing-along verses, and lyrics like ""You said it wasn't
    all that great in your bed.""</p><p>
    
    The Dusters drift back to more prototypical Dischord territory in
    songs like ""Reason,"" in which the listener discovers that there is,
    in fact, ""a season to live in Washington."" Those cherry trees are
    lovely in the spring, but in the same song, Bourgeois admits ""we fall
    divided.""  Meaning, we assume, the drummer is keener on autumn
    strolls along the Potomac.</p><p>
    
    To be perfectly honest, much of this album sounds pretty silly to me.
    The pop to angular post-punk angle doesn't necessary lend credibility
    when your singer occasionally decides to ape Iggy Pop when singing
    about having a ""heart like a revolutionary.""  I tried listening to
    <em>Rock Creek</em> as deliberately tongue-in-cheek, but I don't think
    that's the case.  Of course, I'm always willing to admit I'm wrong.
    Come tomorrow I could find out this is concept album inspired by the
    National Zoo (located in Rock Creek Park).  If that's the case, the
    chorus lyric in the title track, ""I'll make my mark here in Rock Creek
    Park,"" could have some pretty hairy implications, especially when
    coupled with the later sentiment, ""I won't deny the undead.""  So they
    can't write lyrics. Big fucking deal, right?</p><p>
    
    The final track, ""Freedom""-- which, with its dirge-like tempo, half-assed
    attempts at harmonies, big anthemic chorus, and relationship-tinged lyrics
    could be considered something of a power ballad-- is really all you need
    to hear. It sounds boring and incomplete, like fifty songs you've heard
    before. And here's the worst part: my guess is that your fifty songs would
    be different than mine. That's just how typical this is.</p><p>
    
    So either Dischord needs to change its D.C.-only policy or provide a sudden
    influx of struggling musicians with affordable housing to enliven their
    catalog.  If any of you were counting on Capitol City Dusters to lead a
    D.C. renaissance, you'd best be staking your claims elsewhere.</p></div>"|1290.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1290-rock-creek/|5.0|Alison Fields

    a jerkass. Perpetually wronged and rarely laid men were capable of being
    intelligent about their bitterness, focusing their anger not on the whole of
    womankind, but on particular women (usually flirts and teases) and attacking
    these women with a potent blend of wit and bile. Rather than self-aggrandizement,
    self-deprecation reigned supreme.  More importantly, subtlety won out over
    blatant self-pity or obnoxiousness. Yeah, these gentlemen were angry, but they
    were smart enough to know what they were angry at-- and geeky enough to
    include themselves in that category.</p><p>
    
    At the helm of this trend towards new-wave geekdom was Stiff Records, a small
    label operating out of England with a roster including Ian Dury, Nick Lowe,
    and the mighty Elvis Costello. With his 1977 debut, <i>My Aim Is True</i>,
    Costello exploded onto the punk/new-wave scene like a mutant hybrid of Buddy
    Holly and Johnny Rotten.  He had the seething contempt of a punk, but a
    transparent intelligence, sensitivity, and melodic sense that made him much
    more interesting than many of his contemporaries. Punks didn't give a fuck;
    Elvis was sensitive enough to not only give a fuck, but smart enough to be
    pissed off and disturbed by that fuck.</p><p>
    
    On <i>My Aim Is True</i>, Elvis' raw energy comes through in a way that's
    never completely recaptured on later records. While the songs range from
    mellow country twang to full-on, spitting assault, there's a strange
    cohesiveness to the album simply by virtue of its rough, rushed feel.
    Although it's a studio album, there's a latent energy to Nick Lowe's
    production that grants <i>My Aim Is True</i> all the immediacy of a live
    show.</p><p>
    
    While Lowe's blunt production certainly enhances the record, the real star
    here, naturally, is Elvis himself.  <i>My Aim Is True</i> is host to some of
    the best songs Elvis has ever penned. The brief kick in the balls of the
    opening track, ""Welcome to the Working Week,"" is perhaps the album's perfect
    mission statement. With poppy ooh's, a catchy melody, and an undeniably sharp
    edge, the song excellently captures the cyanide-laced slab of peanut brittle
    that is Elvis. The lyrics are rife with brilliant, subtle innuendo.  From the
    opening line, ""Now that your picture's in the paper/ Being rhythmically
    admired,"" it's clear that Costello isn't going to stumble into any cheap
    lyrical traps. A lesser man would have just used some goofy synonym for
    masturbation; Elvis went and used the phrase ""rhythmically admired.""  It's
    more subtle, more original, and infinitely cooler.  That's why you love
    him.</p><p>
    
    ""Miracle Man,"" ""No Dancing,"" and ""Blame It on Cain"" bring the album down a
    notch with an off-kilter punky-tonk feel. ""No Dancing,"" the highlight of the
    three, introduces a Phil Spector-style effect of massive percussion and
    multitracked vocals. ""Blame It on Cain,"" a typically Costello-ish tale of
    dissatisfaction, swaggers with twangy country guitar and pained vocals.</p><p>
    
    Clover guitarist John McFee, whose guitar stylings accentuate ""Blame It on
    Cain,"" makes his grandest statement on the album's next track, ""Alison.""
    Besides being one of the great melancholy pop songs of all time, ""Alison"" is
    the finest example of Costello doublespeak to be found anywhere in his
    catalog. When Elvis sweetly intones, ""My aim is true,"" he could as easily be
    alluding to shooting his ex-lover as trying to win her back. Lines like,
    ""Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking/ When I hear the silly
    things that you say,"" are far too loaded and complex to be written off as
    simple aggression.</p><p>
    
    A similar blend of pop, bitterness, and convoluted imagery comes with ""(The
    Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes,"" the catchiest pop song on <i>My Aim Is
    True</i>, and home to the immortal line, ""I said I'm so happy I could die/
    She said 'drop dead' and left with another guy."" ""Less Than Zero,"" a charming
    ditty about a British fascist, appears in two forms on this reissue-- the
    original album cut, and a live ""Dallas"" version, in which Costello brilliantly
    twists the lyrics to focus on Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, rather than
    the aforementioned fascist Oswald Mosley.</p><p>
    
    While every track on <i>My Aim Is True</i> is great, ""Watching the Detectives""
    closes the album at its highest point. A reggae-flavored nod to film noir, the
    song rumbles with style and force. Elvis' nerdy whine sounds wonderfully
    displaced amidst the heavy bass and syncopated drumming, and perfectly ties
    up the vague themes of love and murder running through the record.</p><p>
    
    This new reissue by Rhino allows <i>My Aim Is True</i> to end with ""Watching
    the Detectives,"" cramming all the bonus tracks onto an extra CD. The bonus
    tracks themselves are almost identical to those found on the previous Rykodisc
    reissue, with the addition of the ""Dallas"" version of ""Less Than Zero"" from
    the <i>Live at El Mocambo</i> disc, and previously unreleased, early versions
    of ""No Action"" and ""Living in Paradise,"" which both sound excellent.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, these early editions of later Costello songs nicely demonstrate the
    tradeoffs that occur with later albums. While these versions don't sound as
    smooth or as distinctively Costello-ish as the later ones, they pack an
    energy and punch that, in some ways, encapsulates Elvis' intensity better
    than later renditions. But rather than being gratuitously hateful or
    aggressive, Elvis treats his bitterness like a fine wine, letting a complex
    bouquet of anger, doubt, and pity shine through. Wordy, witty, and geeky as
    fuck, <i>My Aim Is True</i> is without question one of the finest statements
    of brilliant nerddom ever to be released.</p></div>"|1617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1617-my-aim-is-true/|9.8|Matt LeMay

    Múm's growing profile makes perfect sense. With labels like Schematic and
    Tigerbeat6 working the fringe of DSP lunacy, those looking for a more 'musical'
    flavor of this sound found a kind friend in Múm's <em>Yesterday Was Dramatic,
    Today Is Okay</em>.  Múm took the choppy beats and rapid-fire sequencing of IDM
    and made them soft, sweet and welcoming. It made for a great record that will
    be recognized as a classic of the genre.</p><p>
<em>Yesterday Was Dramatic, Today Is Okay</em> was actually recorded and released
    in Iceland in 2000, but only made its way stateside in 2001, partially on the
    strength of the hype for all things Icelandic that followed in the wake of Sigur
    Ros' unlikely breakthrough.  The quartet, two pairs of beautiful boys and girls
    that look like the Platonic ideal of indie kid-ness, have spent the time since
    working on a remix compilation and crafting the follow-up record, <em>Finally We
    Are No One</em>.</p><p>
    
    This tiny little thing is the teaser, released to coincide with the video planned
    for the single ""Green Grass of Tunnel."" Unfortunately, this single is on the
    stingy side, consisting of the album version of the song, a nice instrumental
    called ""In Through the Lamp,"" and a truncated and pointless ""video edit"" of
    ""Green Grass of Tunnel."" To me, a short CD containing a ""video edit"" of a song
    should also have the video in question; there are no extras to be found.</p><p>
    
    In any event, ""Green Grass of Tunnel"" points to a new, more song-based directior
    for Múm. The familiar female vocals are mixed way up front, and rather thar
    chanting or offering another texture, they're singing an actual song.  In fact,
    the group sounds more like a band here, with a muted backdrop of old-school
    organ, accordion and drum programming giving their sound a more human touch.
    It's a nice little song, fragile and pretty as blown glass. ""In Through the
    Lamp"" is a quiet, drifting instrumental centered around a few notes played or
    a fuzzy drone of a synth patch. Around this intriguing sound Múm layer plucked
    acoustic guitar, distant horns and sound effects. Something about this track
    reminds me of a deserted beach on an overcast day: desolate and lonely, yet
    oddly comforting.</p><p>
    
    Buy ""Green Grass of Tunnel"" if you're a seven-inch collector and Múm fanatic
    looking for a nice b-side. The inclusion of the ""video edit"" of the song is
    annoying, and I expect it's omitted on the vinyl.  Still, it's enough to pique
    one's interest in the upcoming Múm full-length.</p></div>"|5504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5504-green-grass-of-tunnel/|7.7|Mark Richard-San

    called Thee More Shallows, according to a sticker applied to the CD
    case of this band's debut album.  I'm kind of wondering who
    threatened to sue the band-- I can't even find another band on All
    Music Guide called The Shallows.  Hell, I can't even find <em>this</em>
    band on All Music Guide, that's how unknown they are.  It's things
    like this that drive home just how litigious our society has become.
    Two completely unknown elements battling for the same moniker.  It
    just seems silly.  But whether they're Thee Shallows or Thee More
    Shallows doesn't matter much when you're listening to their music,
    so let's get our minds off of all that legal mumbo jumbo and move
    on a bit.</p><p>
    
    Really, calling Thee Shallows a band is being a bit liberal.  They're
    actually a duo comprised of longtime musical collaborators Dee Kesler
    and Tadas Kisielius, assisted by a large rotating cast of friends--
    most notably two able drummers and some string players-- and the result
    comes across as something like a three-way collision between Death Cab
    for Cutie, American Analog Set and Yo La Tengo's <i>And Then Nothing
    Turned Itself Inside Out</i>.  Tadas' voice is almost a dead ringer for
    Death Cab's Ben Gibbard, especially when he hits his falsetto, which is
    just about constantly.  His willowy tenor is wrapped in downy layers of
    clean, skeletal guitars and quietly droning organ.  A certain dark
    moodiness permeates everything, staking its claim on every second of the
    album, from the gentle violin-dominated instrumental ""Pulchritude"" to the
    noisy crescendo in the midsection of the title track.</p><p>
    
    By and large, <em>A History of Sport Fishing</em> is a nicely conceived
    album, opening with the tense ""Where Are You Now?""  Kisielius sings
    in a near-whisper over a bed of minimal guitars and gradually
    swelling organ.  The band shifts the texture effortlessly throughout
    the song, making it one of the album's most captivating tracks.
    While the pacing on that song is nearly perfect, though, the rest of
    the album doesn't fare quite as well.  </p><p>
    
    Even a sterling track like ""The 8th Ring of Hell"" suffers a bit from
    an overlong guitar intro, though the most tiresome section of the
    album is easily the title track's aforementioned midsection.  Simply
    put, the band doesn't do a noisy grind well enough to justify
    attempting it for four full minutes.  Elsewhere, songs like the
    instrumental ""The CruXXX"" manage to develop rhythmically, but offer
    nothing the least bit melodic to hang on to, instead simply plowing
    cleanly picked guitar arpeggios into the ground.</p><p>
    
    And that's the album's other primary flaw-- though almost uniformly
    pleasant, <em>A History of Sport Fishing</em> seldom casts a truly
    strong hook to reel you into its world.  Consequently, the most
    memorable thing about a song like ""I Do So Have a Sense of Humor"" is
    its title, though the string arrangement at the end is kind of nice.
    With some work on building a few more barbs into their sound, Thee
    Shallows could have a good future with their newly modified name, but
    for now they'll have to settle for being simply pleasant.</p></div>"|7984.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7984-a-history-of-sport-fishing/|6.0|Joe Tangari

<li> The ubiquitous flag stickers, adorned with weeping airbrushed
    eagles and monotheistic imperatives;<p>
<li> Official Osama Bin Laden Hunting Licenses (bummer, the back says
    it's fake);<p>
<li> Lee Greenwood reissues, with covers featuring the aggressively trimmed
    Comeback Beard;<p>
<li> The commemorative toboggan, stylishly embroidered as if 'Ground Zero'
    were a video game or brand of muffler;<p>
<li> World Trade Center halter tops, on which the towers bend around the
    contours of the hootchie underneath, confirming architects' notions that
    the buildings were phallus brothers.<p>
    
    And the winner: why, it's the new Papa M EP, <em>Three Songs</em>, packaged
    in a glossy envelope that sports, as its sole visual, a vivid photograph
    of the Papa (Dave Pajo), bedheaded and squinting in a wrinkled t-shirt
    on a rooftop, as black plumes billow from the New York skyline in the
    background. At least one of the towers is still standing.</p><p>
    
    The picture somehow outhaunts most of the straightforward, photojournalistic
    accounts of that morning and manages to capture how we floundered to process
    its reality by relishing its surreality (people agree with you if you compare
    9-11 to movies, but accuse you of spouting geopolitical hoo-hah if you
    Noam-Pompsky-ly address it as a karmic reaping of seeds sown in Nicaragua,
    Beirut, Turkey, and Sudan).  For starters, the <em>Three Songs</em> cover shot
    is circular, with blurred edges, as if a view from some vindictive witch's
    crystal ball.  Adding to the alchemy is the foregrounded brick cityscape of
    (Brooklyn? Newark?) tenements, factories, and warehouses leading up to
    Manhattan's smoking glass and steel.</p><p>
    
    The picture serves as a time-lapse cross-section of the Industrial Revolution
    that offers a glimpse of an igneous, purgative devolution.  Then there's Papa
    Pajo, looking like a bored suburban kid dragged out of his car-nap at Old
    Faithful, happy to not comprehend the significance of what's behind him.  Or
    is Pajo mediating the moment, like an on-scene anchorman, or worse, like the
    yammering host of an ""America's Wildest Car Chases""?  Surely no one involved
    simply had album cover art in mind?  The photo inspires as much outrage and
    empathy as the moment when the attackers turned the rest of the world into an
    observation deck.</p><p>
    
    Oh yeah, there's a nifty CD inside, for which the cover functions as a portentous
    and schlocky epigraph, like the quotes from the Book of Revelation that open
    cheesy horror movies. (And hey, for all you amateur numerologists and Nostradames
    out there, this EP's length is 18 minutes, the sum of the digits of the number
    of the beast!)  Pajo's M-centric projects were instrumental affairs until he
    covered one of the Misfits' most cartoonishly brutal classics back in 1998,
    and since then he's recast songs by Daniel Johnston, Cat Stevens, and Bob Dylan
    with a plaintive starkness that's earned him an esteemed berth in Drag City's
    hierarchy of glorious, mopey balladeers.  Many figgered Pajo to be slumming in
    the world of porch-plink, since his indie-rock resume overqualified him for just
    about every other genre-- including whatever genre Billy Corgan recruited Pajo's
    skills for as part of his new project, Zwan.  But Pajo's done a bang-up job of
    paralleling the constipated-diarrhea career arcs of Bonnie Billy Oldham and
    Smog, releasing 25 short gems (13 singles, 12 compilation appearances) on labels
    with varying levels of slippery distribution. It's their world; we just shop in
    it.</p><p>
    
    Pajo's image as a bandmember is that of a renaissance ogre, lurking in the
    charismatic shadows of other frontmen.  And even on his own, he's got a kind of
    inverse charisma, a Travis Bickle tincture that he finally allows to blossom on
    ""Rainbow of Gloom,"" quoting <em>Taxi Driver</em>'s sentiments about rain washing
    away the scum. This song and ""Lo the Rose Cease to Bloom"" only involve a
    harmonica, guitar and keyboard, but they're as engrossing as any of Pajo's more
    layered soundscapes, as the lyrics bang archetypal Irish folk syntax up against
    post-everything ennui with a dollop of transcendent carnality. Bookended between
    these affecting slow-burners, the rousing and anthemic ""O Kentucky"" stands out
    like the black Ghostbuster; the song is all buildup, as soft drums referee a
    wholesome piano riff's unfair fight against an obtusely Skynyrdian axe. </p><p>
    
    Like his picture on the cover, Pajo's songs make you wonder: is he this forlorn?
    Or just hung over? Could he be smirking? This isn't the first time he's invoked
    tragedy-- the Aerial M album's liner notes credit its genesis to a great flood
    that year, and that record was a statementless chunk of atmospheric trig-pop
    that seemed designed to be played before shows to stump insecure completists.
    The whole mystery's enough to make me want to drop the detached/savvy pose and
    admit that I love America <i>and</i> this EP, even though its odd case sticks out
    in my CD collection like a <em>Collateral Damage</em> ticket stub. I need to
    confess that I drink beer and cry to these songs. Okay, I cry to them sober.
    Okay, I pretend that Armageddon has broken out, and that we're all doomed, and
    I fill a plastic kiddie pool with Wendy's Frosty dairy desserts, and blast Papa
    M.</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|6154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6154-three-songs-ep/|8.0|William Bowers

Oh, maybe you're at
    school or work.  Well, it's quite nice outside-- I'm inside, too,
    but just through the window I can feel a light breeze, sunny sky
    and green everywhere.  There's a bird or two whistling, and every so
    often I can see bits of dandelion seed drift by.  God, it must feel
    really good out there.  Good enough to take my guitar, go sit in the
    garden and strum out a few hymns to mother nature.  Except, I don't
    have a guitar.  Or a garden.  And strumming out nature hymns sounds
    too much like something involving John Denver and non-profit
    organizations to be any fun.  What a waste of a day.</p><p>
    
    Unless, that is, you're Richard Youngs.  On <em>May</em>, he seems very
    content to while away the hours serenading the new bloomers and
    ancient, perennial warmth.  Born in Scotland, Youngs' music can vary
    from experimental psych (last year he released a record with Acid
    Mothers Temple frontman Makoto Kawabata), to minimalist electronic,
    to traditional folk.  Though he's as prone to use kazoo or detuned
    piano in his pieces as the acoustic guitar on this release, his
    releases generally hold the 'less is more' aesthetic in common.  He's
    not lo-fi necessarily, but he has a knack for wringing emotion out of
    the slightest recording equipment or available instrumentation.</p><p>
    
    The unadorned balladry  on <em>May</em> is generally free of
    unnecessary movement or texture (in that respect, most similar to
    1999's <em>Sapphie</em>).  You might call this music minimalist folk,
    because its melodies drift through basic, repetitive guitar figures,
    like a passive counterpoint to a barely running stream.  The
    accompaniment is at once colorless and metronomic-- not mechanical,
    but something instinctual and never-changing.  Youngs' vocals are
    reedy (some might say thin), closest in timbre to fellow eccentric
    Brit Robert Wyatt, and at times seem to lapse into overtones-- the
    way he elongates his phrasing, compressing his voice to hollow out
    its natural depth may be off-putting for someone accustomed to more
    traditionally 'pretty' singing.</p><p>
    
    The songs themselves may have been improvised, as often the lyrics
    serve little purpose other than to have Youngs be able to say
    something while he sings.  The final tune, ""Wynd Time Wynd,"" uses its
    title as its complete lyrics, featuring but the smallest variation
    (""You wynd it all the time"").  It's typical for this album, in that
    it has two parts: the first melody and the second melody.  There is
    no chorus, per se, or maybe there are just two very long choruses.
    Again, it's the basic statement and subtle variation as restatement
    that calls to mind minimalism.  If you aren't up for very small
    pleasures, <em>May</em> could quickly become tiresome.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Neon Winter"" is an extreme example of that technique.
    Youngs' high-register vocals struggle to carry the simple (almost
    medieval) melody, while his guitar plays along in unison.  When his
    vocal drops out, the guitar repeats the melody.  If you think of a
    kind of music that might have been played by Celtic druids a thousand
    years ago to celebrate the new moon, with primitive instruments and
    even more primitive ideas of what constitutes engaging song, this
    music makes a lot of sense.  On the other hand, if you aren't willing
    to step into nature, slow down your life's pace and drift, it could
    seem like torture.  ""Bloom of All"" is less Spartan, featuring a more
    modern folk guitar figure, and some nicely lilting vocals from
    Youngs.  It's barely there, but at least has roots in something
    post-Renaissance!</p><p>
    
    I won't say this music is necessarily unengaging, because I can
    imagine a couple of instances where it might really hit the spot.
    Ideally, the scene I described at the outset, with a breeze and a
    garden to set the mood, would accommodate this stuff very well.  If
    you don't have those kinds of things at your disposal, you might
    consider moving to the English countryside and stowing away in
    someone's old barn for the rest of the season.  With <em>May</em>, your
    surroundings could make all the difference.</p></div>"|8839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8839-may/|6.4|Dominique Leone

    1) Certain members of Bats and Mice-- Ben Davis and David Nesmith to be
    precise-- have past histories with bands I listened to back in the day when
    either living in Virginia, or making frequent show commutes from central North
    Carolina to Virginia. When not puzzling over past hairstyles (why didn't anyone
    tell me I looked like an idiot?) and wondering how the hell I went through one
    whole semester without attending a single class and did not get kicked out of
    college, I get a little misty and sentimental. Those were the days.</p><p>
    
    2) Lovitt Records. I don't know you people, but you've always struck
    me as nice guys. Maybe because Lovitt Records began in the town where
    I once managed to almost flunk out of college (several times), due in
    no small part to attending shows at which once and future Lovitt
    bands played. I do not hold this against them.</p><p>
    
    3) Say what you like about Davis and Nesmith's old band, the
    Sleepytime Trio. No one else in the world could call a song ""Butter
    Scaryflies"" and make it sound just as terrifying as the name implies.
    They were loud. They were self-indulgent. They may have represented
    the genre formerly known as emo (before the definitions of that got
    really weird), but they were never boring. And though I don't really
    listen to that kinda stuff in general, or their CD in particular,
    with great regularity anymore, it will never be sold back.</p><p>
    
    4) If you knew the band included members of Milemarker, Men's
    Recovery Project, Sleepytime Trio, Maximillian Colby-- not a single
    pop group among them, and each partially responsible for Richmond,
    VA's reputation as a haven for weirdos on the musical landscape-- you
    might fear for your eardrums when inserting the CD into your stereo,
    too.</p><p>
    
    Yet Bats and Mice sound like none of the above bands. There's not a
    single instance of extended clanging, shattering guitar, fuzzy,
    unintelligible samples, or vicious yelping on the whole album. This
    is fortunate for listeners with heart conditions and obscure inner
    ear conditions, previously denied the ability to listen to Davis and
    Nesmith for medical reasons. In fact, <em>Believe it Mammals</em>
    sounds quite a bit like Sunny Day Real Estate. I put this CD on the
    stereo (my finger resting on the volume control) expecting to be
    immediately jarred by noise, and instead heard something, well, kinda
    pretty and melodic. Nothing wrong with that, but kinda anticlimactic
    if you're all amped up for the antithesis of pretty.  I'm not going
    to eviscerate this band, because, though it isn't my thing, they do
    it pretty well. If there were a textbook case for the genre currently
    called emo, I suppose Bats and Mice would fit the bill.</p><p>
    
    There's nothing overtly wimpy about the album: the vocals are
    confident, and the musicianship is solid. The songs are effectively
    catchy in that melancholy pop sort of way. Opener ""Safe Bet"" is
    easily digestible melancholy rock in the Death Cab for Cutie vein,
    which erupts into a considerable amount of screaming and dissonance
    at the chorus. It's not terribly pretentious. The string section
    didn't get flown in from the local orchestra. There are no keyboards,
    no misguided attempts at new wave, and no covers of your favorite
    80's hits. The harmonies, particularly on ""Worst Comes To Worst,"" are
    subtle and adept. The songs are consistent. Though light on
    surprises, the melodies resolve to expectation. ""Where's Ann Arbor""
    is a standout track of sorts, which drops the rock of the first half
    of the album (to my mind, the better half, but we're speaking in
    relative terms here) for a more soul-influenced sound.</p><p>
<em>Believe It Mammals</em> is remarkably consistent. And though full
    of more scars, tenderness, pain, and hearts than you could shake a
    stick at, the lyrics stop just shy of sounding like Open Mic Poetry
    Yield at the Coffee Cantina.  Is it boring? Maybe--  I can't say how
    many of you will go into this album with Sleepytime Trio flashbacks.
    It's not entirely fair to judge a new band by the prior work of its
    members, but usually the change isn't this dramatic. And to make
    matters worse, when seriously edgy musicians start sounding seriously
    accessible (even radio friendly) overnight, the implications aren't
    always so savory.</p></div>"|584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/584-believe-it-mammals/|6.0|Alison Fields

Well, if you weren't dropping
    X or having a heart attack, chances are what you felt was an arrhythmia-- an
    irregularity in the rhythm of your heartbeat.  Like the title suggests, the
    Anti-Pop Consortium knows a thing or two about irregular beats. Their latest
    LP,<em>Arrhythmia</em>, is a study in them, as well as just about everything else
    irregular, save perhaps my recent string of emergency bowel movements.</p><p>
    
    Anti-Pop Consortium is the charter member of Warp Records' hip-hop club.  This
    should tell you something. In case you haven't been keeping up, Warp has gained
    worldwide accolades for its roster of IDM trailblazers: Autechre, Boards of
    Canada, and Aphex Twin, to name only a few.  And in case you were wondering,
    no, APC doesn't sound a hell of a lot like Ludacris.  Once someone finally does
    the hard work of labeling hip-hop's various subgenres, Anti-Pop just might carve
    out a region known as ""free hip-hop,"" not unlike the free jazz of Sun Ra who
    the boys cite as a major influence.  Their sound is unique, drawing a happy
    experimental medium somewhere between the ghetto and the laptop (or maybe even
    the rave), with cerebral lyrics straight from the poetry cafe.</p><p>
    
    To begin with, APC employs a variety of unusual samples: VH-1 <em>Pop-Up Video</em>
    bubbles, robotic video game bleeps, jingle bells, midsummer's cricket chirps,
    finger snaps, and the most inventive, an entire song built around the bounce of
    a ping pong ball (""Ping Pong [The Return]"").  Behind the samples are
    built-from-scratch drum-n-bass beats-- largely sterile and inorganic, favoring
    programming over sampling dusty vinyl. The results are progressive, glitchy,
    angular and off-kilter.  Again, not Ludacris.</p><p>
    
    Anti-Pop are similarly unconventional in their lyrics, albeit more in their
    content than in how they flow.  So you get a whole track about an unfortunate
    old soul bent on eliminating soap scum (""We Kill Soap Scum""), and another
    telling a tale of wisely avoiding crack-ho jailbait (""Minna Street""). The
    lyrics sound calculated, considered, sometimes profound, and always heady.
    For all who've heard MCs wax philosophical and come off pretentious, you'll be
    happy to hear that APC goes the same route, without the turgid results.</p><p>
    
    Highlights include the first proper track, ""Bubbles."" which tends towards more
    traditional hip-hop, utilizing a P-Funk-style synth-bass hook over congas and
    hand claps. ""Ghost Lawns"" draws from the ""B.O.B."" school of beats, a seriously
    uptempo drum-n-bass number with accordingly frenetic rhymes, and the
    let's-get-ready chants of ""tonight, alright"" by a chorus of young ladies in
    between verses.</p><p>
    
    Pushing hip-hop's creative boundaries has its pitfalls, however. On <em>Arrhythmia</em>,
    where progressive equals electronic, the beats occasionally come off as a tad
    thin. Strange to say, but they just lack soul.  This is the only real weakness,
    but it's a significant one; even though every track is good, none push that
    adjective past a ""very"" prefix. Perhaps rumpshaking is too much to ask for, but
    one might like something nasty, or funky, or fierce.  Yet despite its shortcomings,
    <em>Arrhythmia</em> has plenty of appeal, particularly to the indie crowd, for
    whom progressivism is a badge of pride.  And after all, it is the Consortium's
    best release yet. Just don't expect to see these three on the cover of <em>Source</em>
    anytime soon.</p></div>"|211.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/211-arrhythmia/|7.7|Brad Haywood

I just finished watching a
    program about flatworms. That was some trippy stuff. Flatworms are
    ocean-dwelling invertebrates that everything on the planet evolved
    from, or something. They've been around for trillions of years and
    only now is the young-buck upstart human species beginning to
    comprehend their almost indescribable bizarreness.</p><p>
    
    Flatworms are, basically, psychedelically colored, triple-wide chow
    foon noodles. They lead solitary lives cruising the oceans for bits
    to eat and maybe a shag once in a while. Because they're loners, and
    the ocean's a pretty huge place-- especially when ninety of you would
    comprise a snack-size Cup 'O' Noodle-- natural selection has seen to
    it that flatworms are hermaphrodites. This is a good thing, when you
    consider that the chances of bumping into another flatworm are next
    to zero, and that if two same-sexed worms met up, there wouldn't be
    any offspring. Soon the oceans would be bereft of platyhelminthes.
    And we can't have that.</p><p>
    
    Being a hermaphrodite efficiently side-steps the problem of furthering
    the species. Once you've encountered another flatworm it doesn't matter,
    from a reproductive point of view, who's going to be male or female--
    the pair just has to work out who's going to be mommy. This being nature,
    the flatworms don't discuss the matter or toss a coin for the chance to
    get up the duff. Nope-- remember what Kipling said about nature red in
    tooth and claw?-- the soon-to-be-getting-it-on flatworms battle each
    other... with their <em>two barbed penises!</em>  Yup, flatworms are
    double-wanged, and vicious with them. Mating occurs when the pair
    collides to form a writhing mass of stabbing, spineless ick.  Whoever
    happens to get pierced anywhere on their body by one of those love-spears,
    and thereby injected with wormy jizz, gets to be mommy.</p><p>
    
    Why am I telling you this?  Well, if you're a fan of DAT Politics,
    you're going to be as lonely as a flatworm. If you meet another DAT
    Politics fan, you're going to want to mate with them-- and frequently,
    because the ace <em>Plugs Plus</em> is going to make you one horny mollusk.</p><p>
<em>Plugs Plus</em> is the band's fourth album and continues this
    French trio's exploration of Nickelodeon beatfuckery. It's completely
    brilliant, of course, in a spazzy, freaky-as-a-flatworm way.  DAT
    Politics don't give you a smooth entry into their frazzled music;
    there's no gentle ambient intro. Immediately after you press play,
    ""Re-Folk"" gives you three-minute summary of all the cranked-up mess
    of chipmunk vocals and shredded Spymaniac white noise that will
    appear of the course of the next twelve tracks. ""Re-Folk"" also
    showcases the band's most favored instrument, the butt-trumpet.</p><p>
    
    The butt-trumpet (my designation, not theirs) is the lead melody
    instrument on <em>Plugs Plus</em> and sounds like one of my reediest
    farts-- the ones when I force it out long before it can mature into a
    more satisfying low-frequency fusillade of ass-acoustics. In addition
    to spotlighting the harmonic possibilities of the butt-trumpet, DAT
    Politics have invited a bunch of similarly demented guests for
    <em>Plugs Plus</em>.  Blectum from Blechdom shout and coo for ""Pie,""
    while Lesser's Felix Kubin rides the crispy static acid gabba of
    ""Morgens, Mittags,"" going on about his sardines in German. ""Pass Our
    Class"" finds Matmos and Kid 606 trading ideas about successful
    strategies for acting classes, coming to the consensus that all you
    need really do is show your ass.</p><p>
    
    My absolute favorite, though, is ""Tout Bleu,"" in which DAT Politics
    juxtaposes Stephen Hawking's voice-synthesizer with an erotic French
    mademoiselle purring about chocolate and things being all blue.  As
    Hawking's synth starts to smoke with over-stimulation, DAT Politics
    turn the track into a beach-movie campathon where Sandra Dee teases
    her surfer hunk co-star James Darren into prematurely popping his wad
    to the giggling delight of Sandra's spring-breaking sorority sisters.
    Genius, sheer genius.  <em>Plugs Plus</em> isn't for everyone, however,
    and definitely not for every mood.  But if you're a sex-starved,
    double-wanged invertebrate drifter, <em>Plugs Plus</em> will make you
    one happy, horny hermaphrodite.</p></div>"|2174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2174-plugs-plus/|7.7|Paul Cooper

    rage in the record industry?  Well, listen up, because it's called the ""guitar""
    (pronounced gih-tarr), and it's sweeping the nation faster than all the mood
    rings, slap-bracs and Furbys combined!  Put away your accordions and harmonicas,
    your sousaphones and flugelhorns, your tympani and triangles.  The guitar has
    six strings and a fiberglass body for spectabulous, fantacular, stupelicious fun
    fun FUN!!!  Purchase one today and we'll throw in a record demonstrating the
    possibilities of guitar music-- 764-HERO's <em>Nobody Knows This Is Everywhere</em>--
    at <em>no additional cost!</em></p><p>
    
    Witness, if you will, the guitar in all its majestic glory over the course of
    your complimentary album's ten tracks and fifty minutes.  Licensed guitar
    specialist John Atkins gives a full demonstration of the instrument's
    capabilities, playing crunchy chords, sky-kissing riffs, and squeezing out all
    sorts of fancy sounds by using a number of neato effects pedals (sold separately).
    Your grandma's dusty old pump organ never sounded like this!</p><p>
    
    Not only does Atkins show the almost unfathomable breadth and depth
    of the guitar's capabilities, but he also organizes these
    demonstrations into actual songs like you hear on the radio!  That's
    right, the guitar can also be used as a compositional tool, and
    because playing it doesn't require using your mouth or excessive
    concentration, you can even sing over the music!   Atkins exhibits
    this skill admirably on <em>Nobody Knows This Is Everywhere</em>, with
    catchy tunes like ""Photographic Evidence"" and ""Oceanbound"" that'll
    have you singing along while you desperately try to learn his nasty
    gee-tar moves!</p><p>
    
    The guitar can be played without accompaniment, if you so choose, but
    we highly recommend that the instrument be played with a music
    ensemble of your choice, as Atkins himself has done with 764-HERO.
    With Robin P on the ""bass"" version of the guitar (a lower-pitched
    four-string model, also available), and Polly Johnson banging on the
    drumset, songs increase in volume and complexity.  Listen to ""You
    Were a Party,"" where the band presents how melodic sequences of notes
    played on the bass variant and dynamic drumming can add a stable beat
    while emphasizing your guitar's percussive qualities.  Everything's
    functioning like a well-oiled Rock Machine!</p><p>
    
    What's more, not only does <em>Nobody Knows This Is Everywhere</em>
    show you how good making music with your shiny new guitar can be, it
    also gives you examples of where you can go wrong!  For example, you
    may notice that without sufficient songwriting versatility, things
    can get pretty mediocre and, well, boring by the end of a ten-song
    album.  No, kids, slowing a tune down (""Answers"") or stretching it
    beyond six minutes (""Confetti Confessional"") doesn't make it better.
    Adding more instruments, like the organ and piano on the rousing
    climax of ""The Long Arm of the Law,"" can sometimes help, but don't
    just rely on the presence of keyboards alone to shake things up (see:
    ""Satellites"").  Also, when titling your record, <i>never</i> pun on
    the title of a classic album-- in this case, Neil Young and Crazy
    Horse's brilliant <i>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i>-- just
    because you can't come up with something intelligent.  Think and
    something better will come to you.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, 764-HERO have made these mistakes so you don't have to.
    You see, while the guitar may not be sufficient to carry a whole album,
    <em>Nobody Knows This Is Everywhere</em> shows it can at least provide
    you with a handful or two of peachy keen songs.  And that's all you'll
    need to hit the road, make some dough, and meet cute members of the
    opposite sex!  So what are you waiting for?  Get your parents' credit
    card, dial 1-800-764-HERO, and get your very own automatic, systematic,
    hyyyyyyy-dromatic GUITAR!!!</p></div>"|7080.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7080-nobody-knows-this-is-everywhere/|6.4|Rob Mitchum

No one could really agree where it
    came from, but everyone was certain it had been through a whole bunch
    of effects units by the time it got here. Noise: first as a tidal
    wave, then in short spurts with little bits of silence in between.
    Next came the drums: kind of meditative, and a little spare.  And
    then, the guitar: a bit jagged, sort of high-pitched.</p><p>
    
    Truth be told, it's hard to describe what any of it sounds like
    because it's all sort of hard to hear. This is the first thing I
    noticed about O-Type's <em>Lugubrious</em>-- all of the sounds tend to
    just bleed into one another, with everything sounding distant, murky
    and more than a bit flat.  There's a blanket of noise, stacked with
    loosely structured guitar improvisation, gong crashes, drums that go
    from groping-in-the-dark to rhythmic then back again, and occasional
    electronic weirdness.  Rarely does a single sound stand out long
    enough to take command of the others, to lead them towards something,
    anything.</p><p>
    
    In other words, it's generic output from your standard improvised
    avant-rock band. You know the type: with the rotating door
    membership, the sporadic schedule of jams, and a wall-of-sound output
    that's clearly aided by the music-enhancing abilities of
    hallucinogenic drugs. To be honest, <em>Lugubrious</em> reminds me
    quite a bit like recordings I've made with friends-- long, generally
    unstructured, generally mediocre, but not without their moments.
    It's the sort of thing that's eminently enjoyable to those involved
    in the production, but generally rates a shrug on anyone else's
    entertainment scale.</p><p>
    
    Still, I'm not about to put the hardcore smackdown or
    <em>Lugubrious</em>. While its long drones don't really go anywhere,
    and the electronic meanderings which emerge from the murk now and
    again don't particualrly stand out, it's really not terrible stuff.
    And like, any jam, there are those moments which undeniably work;
    like the interaction between the two drummers, about halfway through
    ""Hermit,"" where building cymbal fills and a tightly kept beat emerge
    from the ambient swamp, only to be swallowed back up in the end. Or
    the rhythmic electronic crackles that bookshelf the synths-plus-drone
    track called ""Clearing.""</p><p>
    
    I was fully prepared to go easy on O-Type, to call them a vaguely
    interesting, if not terribly original quartet of improvisers and ther
    call it a day. And then it suddenly occurred to me where I knew the
    names on the cover from. Bruce Anderson, Dale Sophiea, Marc
    Weinstein, Dave Mahoney?  All four of these guys are members of
    MX-80, one of the first non-Residents related groups to be signed to
    Ralph Records in the late 70's (we're talking the same graduating
    class as Renaldo and the Loaf, Yello and Tuxedomoon here).  I can't
    claim to have heard much of their recent work, but I do know that ir
    their heyday MX-80 was an amazing bunch of musicians, as innovative
    as they came, always evolving, generally refusing to settle down with
    a signature sound. But no matter how weird they got, old-school MX-80
    always had a certain logic to its abstractions, a reassuring sense
    that they were taking you somewhere.</p><p>
    
    Which is precisely what O-Type's <em>Lugubrious</em> is missing.
    Contrary to some beliefs, ""ambient"" is not synonymous with ""aimless.""
    <em>Lugubrious</em> spends far too much time layering meaningless
    guitar noodling over a backdrop of thick noise and not nearly enough
    time giving the listener a reason to keep at it.  Elsewhere, the
    group overcompensates: ""Escape"" pastes a Latin hand-drum and panting
    sample seemingly ripped from Señor Coconut's cover of ""Tour De
    France"" over guitar feedback and live drumming. But the timbres fail
    to mesh, and the prerecorded beats actually seem to trip up the live
    percussion, resulting in a messy pastiche of sounds that were never
    intended to go together in the first place.</p><p>
    
    These are simple mistakes, the kind countless bands make daily.  And
    frankly, I can't summon up an intense hatred toward musicians who
    really are trying their best. Unfortunately, <em>Lugubrious</em> was
    made by musicians with a long career that's yielded plenty of work
    that's head and shoulders above this.  Certainly, there's plenty to
    be said for all-out self-serving improvisation-- for making music
    simply for making music's sake. I have no doubt that the recording
    sessions which spawned <em>Lugubrious</em> were fun and worthwhile for
    the musicians involved.  But fun and worthwhile for the musicians
    doesn't always translate as fun and worthwhile for the listener. Put
    quickly and simply: your time and money would be well spent exploring
    MX-80's fine back catalog.  You'll probably find it wasted if you

    own game on a fairly regular basis. One need look no further than The
    Band and its 80% Canuck cast for proof; their first two albums
    are near-perfect distillations of all that's great in classic
    American-born music forms. And this is to say nothing of Neil
    Young.</p><p>
    
    Presumably named after a line from Young's bleak masterpiece ""On the
    Beach,"" <em>Alone at the Microphone</em> is the second full-length
    album from the Toronto-based band Royal City. Their debut, <em>At Rush
    Hour the Cars</em>, was a fragile, bummed out lo-fi bedroom folk gem.
    Simple, straightforward and exquisite-- even if some of the songs
    were interchangeable-- it served as the perfect holdover while Hayden
    lingered in self-imposed exile.  But as promising as that album's
    high points were, hardly anyone could have anticipated this: a dark
    folk album that effectively ups the ante in the ""old, weird America""
    category (to cop a phrase from Greil Marcus) and accomplishes what
    many faceless, home-bred groups of yokels have been trying to do for
    the past half-decade.</p><p>
    
    As far as acoustic-based indie folk goes, with its inherent
    restrictions and boundaries, this album is as good as it's bound to
    get, kids.  Nearly every song on <em>Alone</em> is a finely detailed
    miniature, each one a new take on despair, loss and (occasionally)
    solace. Haunting and disturbing imagery is harnessed to beautiful
    melodies created on banjo, organ, and even steel drums, in addition
    to traditional rock instrumentation. Sometimes the lyrics are enough
    to make you wince, as on the stomping, ragged opening track ""Bad
    Luck"" where a line like, ""I met you in the alley all covered in
    maggots,"" will just get dropped in there without much warning.
    Still, the gore never seems gratuitous, always serving the overall
    purpose of the songs.</p><p>
    
    The first of these songs, despite its rather cheerless title,
    presents probably the most hopeful moment on the album and its
    high-water mark. Short and simple, a chiming guitar figure
    accompanies singer Aaron Riches as he repeats the refrain, ""Ray of
    light, a pedal in my room/ I will not go forth without you,"" to
    arresting effect.  There is an almost religious quality to Riches'
    assertion-- after painting a bleak scene with ""shit on the floor,""
    the refrain becomes almost heartbreakingly hopeful. It brought me
    closer to tears than any song has been able to do in a long time. I
    can already envision coming back to it in years to come, and I can't
    remember the last time I thought that about a song.</p><p>
    
    ""Rum Tobacco,"" the penultimate song on the album, is another musical
    exercise in build-up and release, but painted over a broader canvas.
    After a frustratingly slow start with Riches croaking along, the track
    finally bursts open with a crash of cymbals before being carried off
    by a slide guitar solo, then disappearing into a silent void for a
    good minute before exploding back again into a witches' chorus for the
    remaining third.  It's one of those songs that takes a few listens
    before you know what twists and turns it's going to take.</p><p>
    
    ""Spacey Basement"" and ""My Brother Is the Meatman"" are really the only
    two missteps on the 11-song album.  And they're not really even bad
    songs in themselves, it's just that they don't fit very well with
    the rest.  Their lyrical shock tactics seem slightly affected compared
    to the sinister edge that characterizes the better songs here.</p><p>
    
    Still, even with these few weak moments, compared to Royal City's
    debut, <em>Alone at the Microphone</em> is a giant step in the right
    direction.  I can't wait to hear what a few more years of touring
    does to this band.  But even as it stands now, with this album, they
    prove that the best post-modern, devil-haunted, gothic Americana is
    currently being made by a pack of Canadians. And if there are any
    questions about authenticity, I give you four words: <em>Music from
    Big Pink</em>.</p></div>"|6852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6852-alone-at-the-microphone/|8.4|Jason Nickey

If you
    listen to their records without at least a remedial knowledge of the
    last thirty years of pop history, with a minor in the butt-rock and
    the electro-pop of the 70s and 80s, you're only getting half the
    story. Each of Trans Am's previous records struck me as an
    enthusiastic homage to overlooked and underrepresented genres. It's
    hard to believe now, but at the time of their 1996 debut, few
    Americans were talking about Kraftwerk and krautrock, and none of
    these people were into metal. Having songs that drew from both these
    worlds on the same record seemed almost revolutionary.  Trans Am
    continued to refine their craft on <em>Surrender to the Night</em>,
    <em>The Surveillance</em>, and <em>Futureworld</em>, culminating with
    what I think is their finest album, the comparatively serious and
    varied <em>Red Line</em>.</p><p>
    
    But that's all behind us now. In 2002, with their new album <em>TA</em>,
    Trans Am makes no sense, no matter what music history text you've
    been reading. Ditching the more experimental direction of <em>Red
    Line</em>, Trans Am sound as though they aspire to be nothing more
    than a second-rate novelty act.  It's an old-school album in terms
    of sequencing-- fourteen songs in 45 minutes-- but it feels long.
    Very long.</p><p>
    
    The successful stabs at straight vocal tracks on <em>Red Line</em>
    apparently encouraged the band to include a half-dozen such songs
    here, and most of these are nothing more than tuneless 80s rock with
    booming drums and half-hearted Michael Sembello synth treatments.
    It's Loverboy-style lite-metal meets new wave, without the riffs,
    melodies or red leather pants. In other words, it's Survivor.</p><p>
    
    When they're not trying to rewrite ""High on You,"" Trans Am revisit
    territory they've covered exhaustively elsewhere. ""Party Station"" and
    ""Infinite Wavelength"" are vocodered pop numbers that might have fit
    on <em>Futureworld</em>, but back then they'd have had the courtesy
    to give us some kind of hook.  ""Positive People"" is a neutered
    version of ""Play in the Summer,"" lacking any of that song's crucial
    Zep crunch and driving rhythm. ""Afternight"" manages to rise to the
    level of adequacy, being a relatively evocative rock instrumental
    close in tone to <em>Surrender to the Night</em>. But the only truly
    arresting moment on <em>TA</em> comes as the tweaked Moog instrumental
    ""Bonn"" gives way to the electro of ""Basta,"" a tune with aggressive
    Spanish rapping and a coda of inspired military drumming.</p><p>
    
    I'm not sure exactly what's happened here-- has Trans Am changed or
    have I?  <em>TA</em> is, by some margin, the band's worst record. There's
    no doubting that.  Where before their records struck me as an affectionate
    celebration of goofy music, on <em>TA</em> Trans Am feels smarmy, arrogant,
    and oh-so-ironic.  Who's got time for that?</p></div>"|8134.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8134-ta/|3.5|Mark Richard-San

    not afraid to say they need their mommies.</p><p>
    
    The Anticon hip-hop collective-- of which Sage Francis is some kind
    of member now-- have a reputation for brainy, convoluted lyrics and
    wordy self-examinations.  Instead of chest-out bragging or shout-outs
    to their small-city hometowns, they use their rhymes to admit weakness,
    and to dredge up every small bad memory of childhood.  Sage Francis
    lets it all hang out on <em>Personal Journals</em>, his first major solo
    release, using his assertive rapping and thick exterior to deliver a
    startlingly self-revelatory album.  His voice, informed by spoken word
    performances, can take on a dramatic frenzy, matched by lo-fi but dynamic
    production from underground DJs like Odd Nosdam, Sixtoo, Jel, Joe Beats
    and Scott Metallic.  And in case anyone thought that Francis was just a
    poetry slam-winning white boy who's here to read his diary, he also
    displays a sense of humor while flexing his lyrical muscles.</p><p>
    
    Francis takes himself apart a dozen different ways on this album,
    starting with two different approaches at self-portraiture.  On
    ""Personal Journalist,"" he explains himself with fast-paced abstract
    wordplay: ""Non-prophet/ Artificially intelligent/ Avant-guardian
    angel... Loyal son, father to none.""  Chaotic street scenes and Jesus
    imagery fill out the track.  On the more direct ""Different,"" riding
    on a throbbing upright bassline, he pronounces himself a drug-free
    vegetarian who ""wouldn't smoke the pot I was pissing in, and I had no
    dead homies to honor while pouring out the liquor I won't drink.""  I
    have seen the future of underground hip-hop, and it is straight-edge.</p><p>
    
    When he brings his family into the fray, the self-analysis gets
    murkier.  Francis' relationship with his mother could fill volumes,
    and every track is full of haunting images and vague, unresolved
    guilt and blame.  He talks about a childhood without a dad: ""Eviction
    Notice"" depicts Francis' mom fighting with her live-in boyfriends,
    while the disturbing atmosphere from cLOUDDEAD's Odd Nosdam evokes a
    picture of little Sage hiding under his bed.  Francis' mom appears
    again in the brutal love/hate ""Kill Ya Momz,"" which lays a heavy
    metal offensive over a creepy, innocent recording of young Sage doing
    a devoted Mother's Day rap.  And then there's ""Inherited Scars,"" one
    of the album's best tracks, about his younger sister; as he looks at
    her scars (self-mutilation?  Tattoos?  Are they the same thing
    here?), he implores her to ""stick it out"" at home as he tries to
    decide who's to blame-- their father or himself-- without ever
    answering the question. </p><p>
    
    Grown-up Sage isn't any less complicated.  The beats are not only
    lo-fi, but hypnotic and claustrophobic-- especially the hand drums
    and drum kit that Sixtoo puts behind his fevered rapping on ""Buckets
    of Silence.""  That and ""Specialist"" are back-to-back studies of
    obsessive love, where the wordplay grows frantic: ""I'm a slow
    self-esteem engine in need of a whore's power.../ I'm holding a
    sleepless beauty pageant on my shark-infested waterbed until it's
    punctured.""  The rejection and his own abusive loving give us one
    picture-- ""Mr. Feel-Nothing,"" who ""saves his tears inside of a cup,
    and he drinks and he forgets that he's an asshole.""  But then there's
    the tender side that comes out in the unabashedly gorgeous ""Broken
    Wings,"" gliding on a beautiful piano line from Scott Metallic's
    production.  It takes a tough man to sing a lyric like, ""We don't
    need no wings to fly,"" and Francis pulls it off.</p><p>
    
    ""By the end of the record I'll make sure y'all know who Sage Francis
    is,"" he promises early on, though he never convincingly finishes the
    job-- he's still figuring it out himself.  There are people who will
    criticize the wordy, convoluted lyrics, or resent the hall of mirrors
    that Francis drops us into.  But being complex doesn't make this
    art: <em>Personal Journals</em> is a success because it turns the
    self-examination into poetry and then, harder still, turns the poems
    into great rap.  And as dark as he gets, Francis makes sure we have a
    good time: dig his sub-karaoke live remake of Bob Seger's ""Turn the
    Page.""  Clearly, nothing embarrasses this guy.</p></div>"|3176.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3176-personal-journals/|8.7|Chris Dahlen

    Festival, Bratmobile joined Bikini Kill as one of the preeminent
    voices of the riot grrl movement.  A firmly bi-coastal band, with
    singer Allison Wolfe and guitarist Erin Smith in the DC/Maryland
    vicinity, and drummer Molly Neumann in the Bay Area, it took almost
    two years of coast-hopping to produce <em>Pottymouth</em>, their first
    LP for Kill Rock Stars.</p><p>
    
    Their sound-- a kitschy, catchy, simple arrangement of spare three-note
    punk rock ineptitude and smokin'-in-the-grrl's-room wit separated them
    from their snarling peers. Where Bikini Kill, Heavens to Betsy and
    others delivered their message in a sneering clamor, Bratmobile were
    funny and goofy.  Attending one of their slumber parties may have also
    required knowledge of contemporary feminist rhetoric, but you got the
    sense they weren't above shoplifting their source material. It was an
    awesome combination that captivated critics and fans, and won the band
    vicarious recognition through the mainstream's fixation on riot grrls as
    newsworthy and-- I say this with no small measure of disgust-- photogenic
    material.</p><p>
    
    Bratmobile broke up in 1994, after the follow-up <em>The Real Janelle</em>
    and a Peel session.  It would be a gross overstatement to say that fans
    grieved.  By 1994, the riot grrl phenom had been fully integrated into
    mainstream consciousness through misappropriation by bigger acts like
    Hole and Babes in Toyland.  Girl power was only a few short years away
    from being co-opted by a slew of British sex kitten pop stars, whose only
    real connection to punk rock was through the glittery slogans on their
    cropped t-shirts.  And it didn't help that Bratmobile were a bit of a
    one-trick pony, whose ultimate message (that girls, even musically untrained
    girls, can rock) would be effectively underscored by newer, better bands.</p><p>
    
    So, I had some reservations when Bratmobile reunited for touring in
    1998/99.  I assumed it was all part of some premature riot grrl nostalgia
    business, sparked, perhaps, by the success of the decidedly 'nicer'
    Sleater-Kinney. I was even more uncomfortable with the 2000 release
    of a new LP, <em>Ladies, Women, and Girls</em>.  Maybe this had something
    to do with the fact that, due to Molly's day job, it was released on
    Lookout! (We could have lived without The Donnas. They're at least partially
    to blame for the antipathy toward women in rock.) And maybe this had to do
    with the fact that the snotty young grrls of Bratmobile were now older, and
    presumably wiser. The snarky in-jokes and playground chants sounded a little
    awkward coming from women approaching thirty.  And truth be told, the whole
    thing was somewhat embarrassing-- three women trying to recapture their moment
    in the sun, which had already been confined to the pop culture graveyard by
    its own practitioners.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us to <em>Girls Get Busy</em>.  And what can I say, really?
    Outside of the sadness I feel at having to give this album a 4.9 (for a
    whole wide variety of reasons I didn't want to), I can only say that
    the incorporation of big crunchy power chords and anthemic hey-hey's
    into ""I'm With the Band"" and ""That's Happening"" only confirmed my worst
    fears.  I'm inclined to believe Bratmobile was better when they couldn't
    play.  Lyrics like, ""Girls make music/ We're here to stay,"" though certainly
    a laudable sentiment, strikes me as completely obvious.  Does anyone--
    and <i>especially</i> anyone who would listen to a new album by Bratmobile--
    still question that?</p><p>
    
    What's worse, the more overt politics of <em>Girls Get Busy</em> tarnish
    my cherished image of Bratmobile. ""Shop for America,"" with sentiments
    such as, ""We won't fight your fucking war,"" and ""Shut Your Face,"" with
    its repetition of ""girls are dying"" are tough to digest when you're
    secretly hoping for ""Girl Germs, Part II.""  And while Neuman and Smith's
    musicianship has clearly improved from a technical standpoint, Wolfe's
    once idiosyncratic and instantly recognizable voice has matured into a
    flat, generic punk-rock-girl monotone.</p><p>
    
    I have two theories. One, that Bratmobile figures that with slicker
    production, bigger sounding songs, new vocals, and less humorous
    lyrics, they will be taken more seriously.  But at what cost?
    ""Sounds like Bratmobile"" was a phrase I used to positively describe
    music.  Bratmobile no longer sounds like Bratmobile-- they sound like
    the pedantic would-be riot grrls whose presence at punk rock shows
    circa 1993 required your unilateral support and, of course, no
    laughing. What was once a breath of fresh air now feels like
    back-breaking labor.</p><p>
    
    Second theory is trickier: trying to stay in the business once your
    fifteen minutes have come to an end requires either branching out into
    new directions or trying to conform to what the kids like today.  The
    current batch of sixteen-year-old girls (who, incidentally, were in
    <i>kindergarten</i> at the time of the first Bratmobile show), are a
    harder sell.  The wider public fascination with the indies has long
    since faded, and Kathleen Hanna no longer makes MTV News. Staying
    relevant is a bitch, and letting go is even harder.</p><p>
    
    Is it enough to know that your band positively influenced a bunch of
    wide-eyed girls ten years ago, and that we're still talking about it
    long after the fact?  I'd count myself fortunate to have influenced
    even one.  But then, maybe that's why Bratmobile is putting out the
    records and I'm just writing about them.</p></div>"|919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/919-girls-get-busy/|4.9|Alison Fields

    to Built to Spill.  Sure, they'd probably say otherwise if asked
    flat-out, claiming that calling in Doug Martsch to produce their
    debut wasn't a calculated move to cast themselves as a minor-league
    BtS.  Nevertheless, I see right through their shrewd little scheme;
    after all, Martsch doesn't even produce his own stuff by himself,
    presumably leaving much of the knob-twiddling and switch-flicking to
    Northwest mastermind Phil Ek.</p><p>
    
    Furthermore, based on the evidence of <em>Building a Building</em>,
    it's pretty clear that Martsch is no hotshot Producer Phil behind the
    boards, be it Ek, Elvrum, or Spector.  But the warts-and-all approach
    befits Pajama Party in a Haunted Hive and their rumpled sound.  If a
    Built to Spill comparison must be made (and it must), think the fractured,
    Pavement-ish early period rather than the three-guitar nouveau classic
    rock of Doug's recent works.</p><p>
    
    May the vengeful God of the Old Testament strike me down should I
    invoke the name of Idaho's finest again, because it's not really fair
    to the three strapping young lads of Pajama Party.  The Jensen
    brothers and Dan Giberman possess an above-average amount of what we
    in the biz call 'potential,' and despite its short 26-minute length
    and rough sound, <em>Building a Building</em> shows it.</p><p>
    
    Be it the humble presentation or otherwise, Pajama Party in a Haunted
    Hive sound their strongest when arrangements are stripped down and
    taut.  Jaunty rockers ""Capitalism's a Fake Smile"" and ""Elevation Map""
    showcase the trio's appealingly loose sound, bright guitar and busy
    drumming skipping along pleasantly beneath singer Elijah Jensen's
    friendly vocals. Whether sharing the mic with sister Rachael on
    ""Over"" or high-note straining over simple acoustic accompaniment on
    ""Silver State,"" Elijah's voice has just the right amount of disregard
    for traditional pitch to complement the band's slapdash vibe.</p><p>
    
    But <em>Building a Building</em> misfires when the slack atmosphere
    bleeds over into the songwriting, with the opening ""Oh Yeah!"" and
    singalong ""The Day She Died"" coming off half-baked and overly
    fragmentary.  Meanwhile, the album's one attempt at a space-rock guitar
    epic (aptly named ""Astrological Charts"") doesn't sit as well with the
    lo-fi environment created by Martsch, whose overly busy Moog stylings
    on the song are only a distraction.  Despite the occasional wobbly step,
    though, <em>Building a Building</em> indicates a band with prospects,
    placing Pajama Party in a Haunted Hive on track to join Modest Mouse
    and Built to Spill in the northwest region spotlight.  Oh shit, wait,
    that wasn't a comparison, it was just a-- <i>[zap]</i> aaaaaaaaRRRGGGHHH!!!</p></div>"|6125.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6125-building-a-building/|7.0|Rob Mitchum

    released a series of EPs that were basically lines of code in aural
    form.  Instead, the duo have decided to hit us with five tracks'
    worth of twisted mechano-funk.  ""Kitchen"" serves up crisp electronic
    breaks in the beginning and a bass drop that'll make your subwoofer
    shudder.  Surprise, they've got a mean robot voice now, mumbling
    cyclically that ""the city's your identity everyday in the city,"" or
    something like that.  Then the metal riffs enter!  Except they're too
    subdued to serrate much, just chugging tastefully in the background
    with the constant cymbal taps.</p><p>
    
    ""Kitchen"" works as a nice appetizer, but later ""Billy Bob's Moustache
    Day"" takes the formula too far.  Tough drum-n-bass pops in blisters
    until a bluesy garage-guitar lick rises and dominates the mix.  The
    effect is <em>Altogether</em> too much like Orbital's lackluster recent
    efforts, and the focus of the song shifts entirely to the melody,
    suppressing the danceable electronic elements.  ""Billy Bob, Billy
    Billy Bob"" goes the perky little sample, as it's bounced maniacally
    around the speakers, and there's a garbled phrase along the lines of
    ""I want to marry my sister""...!  Maybe it's Posthuman's way of
    beckoning, ""Come to daddy.""</p><p>
    
    The hints of humor continue: ""It Started With a Kiss"" creeps along on
    a double-bass lead, the kind of classical tiptoe-music you hear in
    cartoons.  The silence gets shredded by sputtering percussion and
    sped-up beeps that'll have you saying IDM faster than Pam Anderson
    caved when she saw that rock.  It's like a slow-moving cyclone, with
    telephasic keyboards swelling inwards to ground all the chaotic
    clatter.  Squarepushers will love the mathematic antics, and Boards
    of Canada-philes will dig the warm synth colours.  The abstract
    ""Return to Map"" traces a hint of the dark orchestral atmosphere of
    Posthuman's debut, but lightens the mood with theremin-like
    squoogles.  Some harpsichord sounds start tingling and suddenly
    you're in an antechamber in Castlevania, and you know there's
    something not-too-nice around the corner.  But it's not really a
    novelty piece-- it's slyly aware of itself in the beginning, then
    combusts in violent digital shards later on.</p><p>
    
    All of this is just filler compared to the centerpiece, though.  ""The
    Absolute"" is a tale of the time electro met EBM and darkwave.  It's a
    manifesto enough to make me beat my meat, with synths scribbling all
    over and this pivoting snare hiss that makes me think the boys have
    been listening to late-period Front Line Assembly.  One of them sings
    a catchy new-wave vocal line, though you can't tell exactly what he's
    saying for all the vocals distorted Underworld-style.  So yeah, I'm
    completely thrilled with Posthuman's appeal to the dancefloor.
    Almost thirty minutes of warped madness and pure electronic bliss.</p></div>"|6440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6440-posthuman-ep/|7.5|Christopher Dare

As shelf-picked rockstar personas seem to impress
    more easily than sincerity and unpretentiousness, any artist who seeks to let
    his work speak for itself has to deal with the distinct possibility of his
    music going unnoticed. As the number of records being released monthly increases
    at a seemingly exponential rate, being a musician without a gimmick (even if it
    is a weak, done-to-death gimmick) means running the risk of getting lost in the
    shuffle.</p><p>
    
    Ryan Kidwell (aka Rjyan, aka Cex) isn't one to let his music speak for itself.
    Cex's live show has, in recent years, developed into one of the single most
    entertaining spectacles I've ever experienced.  Lots of performers manipulate
    their onstage personas to make themselves appear more interesting or more
    mysterious. But the true brilliance of Kidwell's show is that his whole act
    seems totally sincere. Playing equal parts mad rapper and welcoming host,
    Kidwell drops tight, witty, and endearing rhymes about balls, bicycles, and
    ""Bad Dudes"" over skittery beats, peppered with clever between-song banter
    (""This next song has some violins-- an instrument invented by Radiohead"").</p><p>
    
    So, in the interest of keeping it real, I'll say I'm pretty disappointed by
    <em>Oops, I Did It Again</em>. The Cex I saw in concert was a truly original
    entertainer, putting the best parts of his personality to work for him. The
    Cex I hear on <em>Oops, I Did It Again</em> sounds like he's trying to incorporate
    a pretty wide spectrum of influences with the fun IDM that's been the bread
    and butter of his career this far. And while the result is certainly well
    executed, it lacks the personality that makes Cex such an appealing character
    in the first place.</p><p>
    
    For the most part, <em>Oops, I Did It Again</em> is relatively standard
    IDM fare, with a much greater focus on rhythm than on melody.  Most
    of the sounds on the album have already been used hundreds of times--
    chopped-up drum samples, synthesizers with sweeping filters and the
    occasional odd bit of noise.  The beats that make up the core of
    <em>Oops, I Did It Again</em> are certainly top-notch-- at this point,
    there's no question that Kidwell knows how to put together a song.
    The problem is, there isn't much on <em>Oops, I Did It Again</em> that's
    particularly riveting.  Take the warm acoustic guitars that fill out
    ""(You're) Off the Food Chain,"" a track that sounds almost like the
    Microphones.  Elements like these are never really integrated, and
    all are worked into similarly deliberate, repetitive song structures.</p><p>
    
    In concert, Cex's rhythmically interesting and consistently amusing
    rhymes bring his music to life. Far too much of this record is simply
    boring. It's a testament to Cex's inherent talent that the most
    uninteresting and typical aspects of <em>Oops, I Did It Again</em>
    are also the ones that seem the most forced.</p></div>"|1390.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1390-oops-i-did-it-again/|6.6|Matt LeMay

    dependable. I doubt that anyone could seriously say that any of their
    nine albums is a disappointment. Sure, no release is without minor
    slip-ups, but at least the duo of Steve Cobb and Dave McSherry have
    never released a total wipe-out like <em>Drukqs</em>.</p><p>
<em>Jump Leeds</em> has a few more slip-ups than its immediate
    predecessor, <em>A Touch of Cloth</em>, but I'd like to think they
    result from the addition of a vocalist (Steve Edwards of Presence)
    rather than being an indication of pending obsolescence. <em>A Touch
    of Cloth</em> really was the epitome of downtempo.  Rather than being
    an assemblage of quirky samples like Lemon Jelly's or Bent's output,
    Fila Brazillia's eighth album was a sophisticated soundtrack to a
    bizarre, yet meticulously plotted porno salivated over by hipsters
    who surely have a take on Cassavetes.</p><p>
    
    It takes some commitment to get into a Fila Brazillia album-- Cobb
    and McSherry don't give up their goodies on a first date. During the
    many hours I've spent digesting their albums I've discovered all
    manner of concealed wit, harmonic inventions, and melodic whims.
    <em>Jump Leeds</em> differs slightly, however. The band have buried all
    these wonderful things and scattered the low-nutrient topsoil of
    Edwards' R&amp;B; crooning all over them.</p><p>
    
    As he proved on Presence's <em>All Systems Gone</em> album, Edwards
    possesses exactly the right voice for that irony-free class of deep
    house that acts as a rallying call for cemented-to-the-sofa
    connoisseurs. Edwards can warble and exercise his vibrato technique
    during poignant bits and can belt out the hallelujahs as forcefully
    as any four-hundred-pound gospel diva. But there are definite
    drawbacks to setting such booming skills amid Fila Brazillia's
    intricate downtempo. To the band's credit, they've limited Edwards to
    four tracks.</p><p>
    
    As if a hangover from the stained-glass artwork of <em>A Touch of
    Class</em>, <em>Jump Leeds</em> begins with a church organ stating the
    compelling theme of the opening track, ""Bumblehaun.""  But it doesn't
    stay ecclesiastical for very long.  The track transforms into an
    exceptional parody of 80's club funk, an infectious groove those
    Euroclash retro-futurists would gladly pawn their Commodore 64's for.
    Cobb and McSherry really show off during ""Bumblehaun"" and on first
    listen it staggers belief that they haven't used up all their
    creative juices in the opening track.</p><p>
    
    But the duo are merely getting started, as ""Motown Coppers""
    demonstrates.  Out of a buzzy analog haze, a stomping bassline
    gathers up all the lost children and, in a glorious series of chimes
    and welcoming blips, sends them out into a magical world of candy
    cane funk. With a cut 'n' pasted hollerin' blues man, ""Spill the
    Beans"" initially sounds like a bid for some of Moby's cash.  After a
    melodic cock-rock guitar break, Edwards moves up to the mic to
    deliver his hammy-tender lyrics about telling the truth and feeling a
    whole better for the disclosure.</p><p>
    
    ""DNA"" brings the mood down to make-out levels with a wispy guitar
    figure and a sample of Dead Can Dance's ""The Snake and The Moon.""
    ""DNA"" harks back to the dreamy daze of the Grid's classic
    ""Floatation"" and BBG's ""Snappiness.""  Edwards returns for ""We Build
    Arks"" and, along with a pounding bass probe, he unpacks his most
    forceful falsetto as he warbles about Morlocks and how ""Goats run/Goats
    walk/But heroes ride.""  Cobby and McSherry match Edwards'
    phantasmagoric twaddle with a wah-wahed clavinet and plenty of
    righteous menace.  ""Percival Quintaine"" adapts the Edge's appeggiated
    guitar line from ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and reworks it for a
    <em>Starsky and Hutch</em> car chase through Huggy Bear's Harlem.</p><p>
    
    ""Nightfall"" returns to the surreal dreamscape of ""We Build Arks""--
    but in this slumber Edwards can ""hear colours all around the world""
    and see ""calcium from your behind.""  Perhaps the band should have run
    this song by a shrink first?  Though Edwards' nocturnal visions are
    nigh on disturbing, they're nothing in comparison with the horrendous
    gaffe that concludes and mars <em>Jump Leeds</em>.  ""The Green Green
    Grass of Homegrown"" is a folksy ode to the herb that panders
    shamelessly to the fetishistic <em>High Times</em> crowd.  This is the
    type of gauche mishap I expect from artists who cut and paste twee
    thrift store samples into their Fruity Loops song creation software,
    not from an exceptionally talented duo whose love of music and
    enthusiasm for playing is, for me, as irrefutable as Newton's great
    discovery.</p></div>"|3055.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3055-jump-leeds/|7.8|Paul Cooper

Remember the days when the pre-digital Walkman was
    criticized as the most isolating and therefore masturbatory form of
    self-entertainment since the novel?  Remember snickering about needing to buy
    'head cleaner'?  Remembering sacramentally disemboweling the ""I Love You Forever:
    The Supermix"" tape of a partner whose behavior later revealed that they were
    obviously disingenuous about the loving-you-forever thing?  If only I had a
    turtleneck for every date that ended when, after showing me her new tattoo of
    the Chinese symbol for 'woman' that she still hid from Dad, the girl coyly
    asked what was in that big black trunk at the foot of my bed-- only to learn
    that it was full of releases from cassette-only labels. One even sneered, ""I
    don't even know how to <i>use</i> a cassette,"" as if they were a worse
    misappropriation of plastic and the means of mass production than oversized
    ""We're #1"" hands for winless football teams.</p><p>
    
    As big an oddball on the underground landscape as Stephin Merritt, Mountain
    Goat John Darnielle understands how to harness the majesty of the practically
    aborted cassette format.  He appeared on nearly every cassette-only label's
    compilation during their golden era of Xerox-ed and Crayola-ed cover art, and
    released his band's first three proper albums of passionate nasal-fi straight
    to tape.  A zillion vinyl releases and ten CDs later, and the Goats have offered
    the world what 'they' would have us believe is the highest-profile concept album
    ever recorded on a jambox, complete with grinding gears that sound like Darnielle
    rigged a stethoscope to the saliva glands of a retired android. And despite
    consistently featuring more hey's, la's and whoa's than Ringo Starr's spiral
    lyric notebook (hanging on the wall of the Hard Rock Cafe in Bent Musket,
    Georgia, if you want to check it out), Darnielle's yelled lyrics continue to
    pierce layers of the listener's inner ice.  Foes of profane merriment beware:
    the chorus of ""Jenny"" employs a ""hi-diddle-dee-dee-goddamn.""  Who else could,
    with only an abused acoustic guitar accompanying him, pull off a line as prosaic
    as, ""We tried to fight the creeping sense of dread with temporal things""?</p><p>
    
    The songs here that aren't sagas of wayward youths chronicle the trajectories
    of various loves, from courtship, to feeding fruit to each other, to divorce
    and/or death, and sometimes even to hell. Which brings up ""The Best Ever Death
    Metal Band in Denton,"" and its bold invocation of the Prince of Darkness: the
    marginalization of God cost rock one of its central components, which Darnielle
    resurrects with his emphatic envoy, ""Hail Satan!""  Though Darnielle palpably
    dissed Glenn Danzig in a recent issue of his zine <em>Last Plane to Jakarta</em>,
    moments like the chanting of ""Hail Satan,"" that blend earnestness with clever
    condescension, provide clues to how Darnielle does his thing.  He plays with
    tone, dipping sophistication in the muck of primitivity, sampling bits of Emily
    Dickinson, T.S. Eliot, and Philip Larkin in his home-taped, sentimental wimp-rock,
    involving just enough brain food to prevent that Scorsese-bred part of me from
    suggesting, ""Ayy!  I got some Clorox that'll get that heart off your sleeve.""</p><p>
    
    Add ""The Mess Inside,"" with its urgent account of a love that even a September
    jaunt to New York can't save, to the exponentially multiplying list of songs
    accidentally weighted with post-boxcutter connotations of homeland insecurity
    (as well as the lines in ""Pink and Blue"" about Oklahoman wind smelling like
    blood and smoke).  After producing dozens of songs obsessed with mobility (the
    ""Going To ________"" songs), Darnielle's last three albums have been settled in
    one geographic region, hinting at a fusty patience or new maturity. Would you
    believe that ""Blues In Dallas,"" a Hamlet-assed song with a tinny keyboard backup
    and JFK underpinnings, is about something as unsexy as deciding to wait, and is
    also really, really good?</p><p>
    
    Darnielle's craft can convince you to follow his classist/nostalgic aesthetic
    logic: this album would sound perfect on the one-speaker radio atop a custodian's
    pushcart.  You'll start asking, how can there be a sport so colonial that it
    requires as much cultivated land as golf does?  Since so little gets reported
    anyway, what justifies the competing 24-hour news channels?  Didn't 'analog'
    movie monsters at least take up three-dimensional space on the film, unlike the
    computer phantoms of <em>Jurassic Park</em> that leave actors running from thin
    air?  Does every disc in my collection really have to be a performance test that
    justifies my investment in all of that stereo componentry?</p><p>
    
    At least two songs on <i>All Hail West Texas</i> flagrantly bemoan the
    state-of-the-art burden of uncurbed, soul-charring consumption.  But whether
    you embrace the hiss and crackle or not, Darnielle seems to be, like the poets
    he cites, settled in his spot on the fringe.</p></div>"|5454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5454-all-hail-west-texas/|8.2|William Bowers

    way.  All winter I steeped myself in atmospheric gloom, but things
    change, and now a band has come along and brightened everything up for
    me.  The indie kids are walking in the park, casting fey glances at
    one other, tugging shyly at their faded pastel-colored t-shirts.  La
    femme d'argent surveys the scene with a bemused smile hidden behind a
    copy of <em>Le Monde</em>, while the rocker dude slouches by, trying to
    peer over her sunglasses.  And for once, all this doesn't make me
    sick, because I've got Saloon playing in my headphones, too.</p><p>
    
    Saloon are a five-piece from Reading, England.  Their debut, <em>(This
    Is) What We Call Progress</em>, is an auspicious record that basically
    soundtracks this blossoming season.  For those of you in the southern
    hemisphere, the upbeat chords and crisp drums on ""Plastic Surgery""
    will kick-start spring back into action.  Everyone's strumming to the
    chirps of the Moog keyboard and the fair voice of Amanda Gomez.  She
    has one of those sweet, mundanely pretty voices, and it suits the
    breezy melody well.  ""Le Weekend"" begins with a bassline bouncing
    merrily and light keyboard crests, then the instruments all swell
    together, guitars squealing wildly and just as soon settling down
    again.  It's cute without being twee, and makes for great sunny-day
    driving music.</p><p>
    
    This band writes smart little indie-pop songs, and they always seem
    to know where they're going.  ""Girls Are the New Boys,"" for instance,
    begins simply.  Gomez' voice coasts over the galloping drum crashes
    as she coolly intones, ""So this is the new world/ Just like the other
    one.""  But after the chorus and verse, the song extends into a sidelong
    jam that would have the boy with the Arab Strap swaying to and fro.
    On a more quiet front, ""2500 Walden Ave"" floats along on an almost
    feathery lightness.  The rhythm section swells with strains of guitar,
    cello and melodica, carrying the song gently while avoiding the overly
    sentimental.  Gomez layers backing vocals over the track, creating an
    ethereal effect similar to the shimmery, subdued breaks on Stereolab's
    <em>Dots and Loops</em>.</p><p>
    
    There's substance beyond the cheery melodies in their world, though.
    ""Bicycle Thieves"" is a slice of fragile introspection drifting
    through the intricate pulse of the bass and guitar.  ""I'm a
    frightened spider in your mouth/ You're too frightened to speak and
    let me out,"" sings Gomez, backed by an achingly sad viola.  Michael
    Smoughton lets loose one of the slow, solemn trumpet swells that
    grace a few of <em>Progress</em>' songs, always at the penultimate
    moment.  ""Across the Great Divide"" builds more aggressively, churning
    forward with thick guitars and strings, its protagonists caught in
    the slow-motion torture of a long-distance relationship.  An
    instrumental section follows, just humming drone and ringing
    glockenspiel and the high-pitched call of a theremin, leaving the
    listener stranded in the divide with no sense of resolution.</p><p>
    
    Even these melancholy songs share a warm, sympathetic vibe.  Fans of
    Belle and Sebastian, Broadcast and Tyro will no doubt enjoy.  If
    there's a fault here, it's with the sound of the disc itself:
    <em>(This Is) What We Call Progress</em> plays as if mastered at a
    muted level, and you have to keep turning up the volume to hear the
    details.  Maybe we can shift the blame to Mahogany mainman Andrew
    Prinz, who produced the album.  But unlike Cruiser, whose <em>Northern
    Electric</em> suffered a similar fate, Saloon's low fidelity adds to
    the delicate aesthetic of their works.  It's like the spring, caught
    between the cold of winter, with ravenous summer approaching.</p></div>"|6986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6986-this-is-what-we-call-progress/|7.4|Christopher Dare

Lacking
    the unifying theme of a soundtrack or tribute album, most compilations offer
    little in the way of fun, creative angles for record reviews.  At best, they
    work kinda like a mass-produced mixtape, albeit one made up of throwaways,
    b-sides, remixes, and demos.  Worst of all, if a cold-hearted critic like
    myself were to mercilessly pan the album, thus decreasing its sales, the
    charitable cause (in this case a homeless shelter/soup kitchen in Rhode Island)
    stands to make less money.  Thus, I must weigh my journalistic integrity against,
    say, frying in hell for taking food out of homeless peoples' mouths.</p><p>
    
    So I'll get that last concern out of the way by declaring up front, without
    qualms, that the second volume in Wishing Tree's <em>The Amos House Collection</em>
    series is a pretty solid comp, ideal for those with a predilection towards
    introspective indie singer/songwriter material.  But that still doesn't leave
    me with a witty and intriguing vehicle for discussing the album, other than
    tried-and-true comp-reviewing formats like song-by-song analysis or
    categorization into ""good,"" ""okay,"" and ""Bright Eyes.""  Ahhh, what the hey:</p><p>
<strong>Artists Who Sound Like Other People</strong></p><p>
    
    Seeing as this compilation is largely made up of acoustic, country-tinged slow
    songs, it's no surprise that a few of the acts sound like they're singing
    karaoke down at the Red House Painters bar.  Drew O'Doherty's ""Oneway"" is the
    most obvious perpetrator of this crime, but he also does a much better job than
    the Clairvoyants on their somnambulant ""Don't You Know.""   Aden, who count
    Senator Phil Gramm's son among their ranks (no lie!), steal the country-rock
    glory by going further up the genre's family tree to Gram Parsons for ""The Red
    Door,"" a laid back steel-guitar treat.</p><p>
    
    The acts wary of C&amp;W; influences opt instead to mimic the sound of Lou Barlow at
    his sparsest, be it Skating Club's enjoyably twee ""Stockholm"" or Son, Ambulance's
    unremarkably noisy ""Two Girls.""  The Gentle Waves' ""Pretty Things"" sounds like
    Belle &amp; Sebastian (duh), but with schmaltzier horns.  Wheat's ""Test Tones (Demo
    for the Flaming Lips)"" ends up, strangely, not sounding very much like the Lips
    at all (maybe a half-hearted stab at <em>Soft Bulletin</em> grandeur).  Yet Elf
    Power, as always, sounds <em>exactly</em> like the Flaming Lips on ""Free Will and
    Testament."" </p><p>
<strong>Artists From My Hometown: Downers Grove, Illinois</strong></p><p>
    
    Believe it or not, there is one: Kleenexgirlwonder.  While the home-recorded
    project of Graham Smith should probably be filed in the category above due to
    his submission's passable GbV clone job, I couldn't resist mentioning our shared
    suburban heritage, nor the fact that he was my high school girlfriend's mortal
    enemy.  People, it really is a small world after all.</p><p>
<strong>Remixes That Are Neither Re-, Nor Mixed</strong></p><p>
    
    A big pet peeve of mine is the remix that sounds only slightly different from
    the original version, and <em>The Amos House Collection</em> has two such offenders.
    An ""early version"" of Elliott Smith's ""Bottle Up and Explode,"" for instance, is
    basically the <em>XO</em> track without drums.  Azure Ray's ""Rise (Deadverse Mix)""
    makes more noticeable modifications, but the newly beefed-up drums and emphasized
    background drone sound like they're bleeding over from the next room.  However,
    Spoon's ""Everything Hits at Once (Remix for Discos)"" subtly tweaks just the right
    elements for increased potency, turning the trad-rock of the original into a
    synth-driven new-wave number.  It's the only song of the compilation that breaks
    the wispy acoustic mood, and it sounds all the more glorious for it.</p><p>
<strong>Appearances By Notorious Pitchfork Punching Bags</strong> </p><p>
    
    We've gotten a lot of mileage out of sucker-punching born targets like Bright
    Eyes and Ida, two bands who make an appearance here. I'll go ahead and throw
    another jab at the former, as Conor Oberst contributes the overlong solo acoustic
    track ""Entry-Way Song,"" complete with shaky voice and characteristic dollops of
    self-pity like, ""I'll start wishing to die again.""  Ida, however, covers the
    traditional country-folk of ""Jubilee"" to great effect, avoiding the overly
    precious and thin sound that's marked recent disappointing efforts.</p><p>

    Other artists, both notable (The Aislers Set, Emily Sparks) and otherwise (James
    William Hindle?) add songs that aren't particularly noteworthy and make little
    effort to break the hazy aesthetic of the compilation.  In fact, when all eighty
    minutes are taken together, <em>The Amos House Collection, Vol. 2</em> is a rather
    sleepy affair, with a consistent mood rarely found in your typical near-random
    assortment of artists' leftovers.  It's not unreasonable to imagine the album
    being used by the Amos House itself to gently drift their homeless tenants off
    to dreamland.  Now you can pretend you're an impoverished drifter, too.</p></div>"|2014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2014-the-amos-house-collection-vol-2/|6.6|Rob Mitchum

    crispily hi-fi a release is, then Playgroup's self-titled debut would
    easily scoop up such an accolade.  However, the majority of Pitchfork's
    readership isn't concerned with albums that give their vacuum-tube
    stereo systems a thorough workout. The majority of you care if an
    album has something to say-- if it speaks to you in some way.
    Playgroup, regrettably, talks loud and fast, but says nothing
    substantial.</p><p>
    
    The face behind the Playgroup facade is Trevor Jackson.  Not a
    household name, but you've likely encountered his production skills
    if you've investigated leftfield-leaning hip-hop and dub funk.
    Assuming the alias Underdog, Jackson remixed several Massive Attack
    singles (""Sly,"" ""Protection,"" and ""Risingson"") as well as Death in
    Vegas' ""Aisha,"" Cornershop's ""Sleep on the Left Side,"" and Sabres of
    Paradise's ""The Theme,"" to name a few of his many treatments.</p><p>
    
    When not tweaking paying clients' work, Jackson runs the Output
    label.  It was Output that gave Fridge their break when they
    released <em>Sevens and Twelves</em>, <em>Ceefax</em>, and
    <em>Semaphore</em>, as well as Kieren Hebden's first Four Tet album,
    <em>Dialogue</em>.  In addition to making cutting-edge UK post-rock
    available, Output released full-on aggro disco/not-disco cuts by
    Sonovac, Gramme, and 7 Hurtz.  Jackson compiled the roughest, most
    thrilling cuts these bands had created on the essential <em>Channel
    1</em> collection. Jackson's Skull project fomented some broken-sound
    illbience and vies with Kevin Martin's Techno Animal project to
    formulate some of the illest industrial dub ever produced.</p><p>
    
    Jackson faultlessly summarizes the disco/not-disco sound with ""Make
    It Happen""-- a bare-bones masterpiece of mimicry that repairs the
    damage caused by Dave ""Sessomatto"" Lee's clusterfuck reworking of
    ESG's ""Moody.""  With ""Make It Happen,"" Jackson appears to understand
    the sublimated aggression that Martin Hannant coaxed from the three
    South Bronx ladies who comprised ESG in a way that Lee completely
    ignored for his own financial gain.  I first heard ""Make It Happen""
    on the <em>London Xpress</em> rarities compilation Nuphonic released
    last year. Since then, I've longed to hear the Playgroup full-length
    and to hear how Jackson would recast a golden era of dance music for
    a 21st century audience.</p><p>
<em>Playgroup</em>, however, is all about cashing in on the current
    vogue for the 80s. Rather than joining the synth-pop crowd (Felix da
    Housecat, Ladytron, Fischerspooner, et al.), <em>Playgroup</em> looks
    to downtown punk-disco and the loft agit-dance of early 80s
    Manhattan and seeks to awaken the departed spirits of Larry Levan,
    Liquid Liquid, and Jean-Michel Basquiat.  Opener ""Number One""
    perfectly pastiches Larry Levan's lysergic remixes. Jackson gets
    Levan down so precisely that he even incorporates a variant of the
    analog synth squiggle that is the signature of Levan's reworking of
    ""Seventh Heaven"" by Gwen Guthrie.</p><p>
    
    Instead of building on the success of ""Make It Happen"" and expanding
    beyond theory-into-praxis slogans, Playgroup is a childish game of
    'let's pretend to be revolutionaries.' But most often, Playgroup
    doesn't even engage on that level.  For instance, in his commitment
    to strip-mine every 80s dance style, Jackson even resurrects
    'hip-house'-- that excruciating amalgam of house music and rap. I'm
    grateful that Jackson doesn't try to convince me that hip-house was
    anything but utter crap-- ""Front 2 Back"" features the lamest rhymes
    since Technotronic and Ya Kid K: ""Hip house and jazz, percussion and
    bass/ It's razzmatazz/ Just feel the flavor/ And jump right in/ 'Cuz
    it's a life-saver/ No special behavior/ Is ever required/ Do it until
    you're tired."" As if that's not torture enough, Jackson recasts Paul
    Simon's ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"" as the Fugees' ""Ready or Not""--
    complete with ""Bring da hook!  Yo! Sing it again, dog!"" interjections
    from his peeps in the studio.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Le Tigre's Kathleen Hanna goes through the riot-grrl
    motions on the Slits-sampling ""Bring It On"" without ever really
    believing that her hectoring will roust anyone from their Ethan Allen
    sofas. Edward Collins does a passable turn during ""Medicine Man,"" but
    only succeeds in making me go digging for my Orange Juice CD's and
    wishing I wasn't broke so that I could afford the recent Josef K
    reissues.  For a couple of minutes Jackson covers the dialectic funk
    of Scritti Politti's ""Sex""-- well, actually just the incendiary bass
    line; Jackson forgoes the in-debt-to-Derrida lyrics. Beyond
    displaying his own flashy production skills, Jackson's only goal here
    (as throughout this album) is to grab someone else's groove, while
    ignoring their often provocative message.</p><p>
    
    Since Jackson has been promoting this gaudy album by appearing at
    swank SoHo parties at Emporio Armani and at <em>Jane</em> magazine's
    invite-only do's, he does nothing to escape my very low opinion of
    this deceitful album. By co-opting and debasing punk-disco's vitality
    and sincerity and thereby rendering the style accessible to the
    botox-and-bulimia set, Jackson betrays the visions of those whose
    ecstatically powerful music he lavishly degrades.  Playgroup is far
    from being people power in the disco hour.</p></div>"|6344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6344-playgroup/|4.2|Paul Cooper

    Pitchfork's own Charly Gordon called ""mildly entertaining,"" this
    band called Limp is four men from Denmark who spend most of their
    time apart, each making electronic music on their own. Jakob Skatt
    (Syntaks), Jonas Munk (Manual), Rasmus Rasmussen (Aerosol) and Jess
    Kahr (just Jess, thank you) spend the bulk of their musical lives in
    front of a computer, looking for the perfect beat with one hand on a
    mouse and the other fingering some power user quick-key combo. They
    come to Limp when they want to rock out a bit and make some energetic
    guitar-based music.</p><p>
    
    Not surprisingly, Limp approach the band angle from the perspective
    of players weaned on electronic music, which is to say, the six-cut,
    30-minute EP <em>Orion</em> is immediately recognizable as post-rock.
    But we're not talking about tense, Slint-derived, Chicago-style
    post-rock.  Rather, <i>Orion</i> utilizes a prettier and more refined
    European approach, without a hint of any jazz background.  Limp paints
    with an impressionist's brush that puts them close to late-period Mogwai,
    crafting pieces filled with gauzy drones, processed fuzz-guitar bleeds,
    and ringing arpeggios that add subtle drama to the climaxes of each song.</p><p>
    
    Limp's basic setup is guitar, bass, and drums, with added synths,
    sampling and studio manipulation.  Though the studio tinkering never
    dominates, the subtle electronic touches are the elements that stand
    out most on <em>Orion</em>. There is a distinct 80s cast to the synth
    treatments that recalls the work Eno and Lanois did with U2. The
    title track is by far the most dynamic piece here, building slowly
    from a hushed, careful intro into a pounding rock tune.  Subtle, but
    necessary, swaths of electronic texture weave in and around the
    chiming, delayed guitars, giving the band something to push against.
    Tracing back even further along the same path, the opening to the
    positively Frippertronic ""City Speaks Tonight"" is a dead ringer for
    Eno's ""In Dark Trees"" from <em>Another Green World</em>, the album that
    provided the template for all his later pop productions.</p><p>
    
    Yet, despite the impressive resumes of its members, the band's
    cohesion as a unit (some of these guys have been playing together
    since they were 11), and the good taste of its influences, Limp just
    doesn't do enough to stand out in this genre.  The pieces are pretty
    and sound nice, but fail to create a lasting impression (a problem I
    have with Mogwai, actually).  Fans of lush instrumental guitar rock
    will probably love <em>Orion</em>; as for me, this is the kind of
    record I only pull out once in a great while.</p></div>"|4801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4801-orion/|6.1|Mark Richardson

    I'm no fan of geographical stereotypes, residing as I do in the
    South. Though at a given point of cultural fascination, a band's
    locality may help them sell records (think Seattle, 1992), there's no
    guaranteeing they'll sound the way you want them to, as all those who
    bought Sub Pop albums on the off chance that the bands sounded like
    Nirvana can attest. We live in culture of near-universal ADD, where
    an 'it' band and a to-the-minute sound have a habit of disappearing
    from public consciousness with a vicious quickness. We get bored
    (raise your hand if you groan at the thought of another Chicago-based
    post-rock band), the music sounds passe (anyone remember the ska
    revival?), and in most of the above scenarios bands are trapped
    riding the coattails of the initial breakthrough act, hoping to catch
    some vicarious limelight before the fashion moment ends.</p><p>
    French Kicks originated out of a high school friendship in
    Washington, D.C., separated during college, and reunited in the
    not-too-distant past in New York City.  By their location alone,
    their sound is about what you'd expect.  If you've ever wondered what
    a J. Robbins partnership with the Strokes would sound like, your
    prayers have been answered, sort of.  Some tracks, like the melodic,
    streamlined ""When You Heard You"" sound quite a bit like Burning
    Airlines.  Some of the more uptempo songs, such as ""Crying Just For
    Show"" and ""Right in Time"" in particular, sound <em>a lot</em> like the
    Strokes. The Kicks also look a little like the Strokes, have a catchy
    name, and walk a stylistic path that places them somewhere between
    New Wave-influenced, radio friendly rock and roll and dissonant
    post-punk.</p><p>
    And the results aren't that bad, actually kind of tantalizing at
    times. Super-clean, methodical music undercut with spare keyboards
    and drummer/vocalist Nick Stumpf's self-conscious crooning. It seems
    like a recipe for at least marginal success, so long as the public
    fascination with this sort of thing doesn't fade into oblivion before
    <em>One Time Bells</em> has a chance to make the rounds.
    </p>
<p>
    But that said, I'm still not sure I like this album.  It's not just a
    question of good songs and bad songs, though there are a few of each.
    The primary candidates for loser status are the two tracks (""Down
    Now"" and ""Close to Modern"") in which the French Kicks venture into
    dangerous blue-eyed soul territory and come off sounding
    (unintentionally, I hope) like Hall and Oates. I admire the bravery
    required for including such eclectic material, and the harmonies are
    nice, guys, really pretty, but...
    </p>
<p>
    Likewise, I would recommend that French Kicks be wary of
    continuing in the vein of their opening track, ""Wrong Side.""  It's
    poppy and polished, could be a candidate for rotation on MTV2, but
    it's a bit boring, like a slightly above-average bar band.  Just
    listening to it makes me want to order a beer.  (Note to Miller
    execs: The French Kicks would be ideal
    for one of your indie rock beer commercials.  Much better than Smog.
    Smog doesn't make me want to party and drink MGD.  I mean, I don't
    really drink Miller beer, but if I did, I would drink it to French Kicks.)
    </p>
<p>
    The New Wave-inspired numbers are a more interesting. ""1985""
    (strictly speaking, it sounds a bit more like 1983, but no
    matter) fuses the French Kicks' fascination with early period Wire
    with an 80s pop sensibility.  Like most of the songs on this album,
    there are elements here I really like-- the sparse guitar, the
    atmosphere-- but it's almost like they went back and tried to make
    the song more accessible after the fact.  The harmonies don't fit,
    for one. The heavier guitars on the choruses
    sounds contrived. Seldom do I ever think music sounds patronizing,
    but it comes off like French Kicks are talented musicians who
    just don't trust their good instincts. Or maybe they can't decide
    what sort of band they want to be. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""One Time Bells,"" the title track, with its chiming guitars and
    consistent melody, is probably the album's best cut. In some ways, it
    best exemplifies their sound, without all the overt influences and
    identity crises.  So, what I've come up with is this:
    </p>
<p>
    While better than some of their previous releases, <em>One Time Bells</em>
    still isn't a mind-blowing album.  But I do think the French Kicks are
    a good band, and I won't be surprised if, an album or two down the
    road, they're a great one.
    </p>

    it's that despite all the conjecture regarding ethics and self-management,
    drugs make for effective music. The Flaming Lips' <em>Soft Bulletin</em>, an
    album which successfully approximates the ambience of a powerful psychotropic
    experience, is regarded as veritably perfect: a 10.0. So, theoretically, the
    sonic approximation of Valium would rank a 5.0 on the Pitchfork rating scale.
    If that's the case, then Jonah and his friends in New End Original are pleading
    with their parentally assigned psychiatrists, social-workers, and Big Brothers
    to help increase the potency of their music as we speak. Dream as we may, though,
    the most visceral experience <em>Thriller</em> induces is the lightheaded wooze
    you experience after a rough bout with carsickness.</p><p>
    
    With ex-members of Texas Is the Reason, the Americans, and Far, one no longer
    needs to scour their older brother's record collection to find a stunning
    synopsis on the quality of musicianship that was being signed in 1991 amidst
    the grunge hysteria.  The fact that each of these guys were in their own
    respective garage bands at the time ensured their being offered record deals.
    But your standard alternative/modern rock radio format can be a bitch-goddess;
    taking with one hand while disbanding with the other, and from the uninhabitable
    landscape produced by the post-grunge insurgence of nu-metal, New End Original
    came to be.</p><p>
    
    Kicking things off with a track the band knowingly refers to as ""Lukewarm,"" New
    End Original want you to know that they've seen the revolution... and it's called
    the <em>Green Album</em>.  ""People always tellin' me how happy I could be/ I'm
    never gonna find out,"" sings Jonah, a man so revered in some circles that, like
    the Greek poets and philosophers that preceded him, society needs only his first
    name with which to fill its history books.  Potential can be heard seeping
    through the cracked vocals and broken equipment littering <em>Thriller</em>:
    ""Hostage"" and ""Leper Song"" recant on the group's more wounded interpretations
    of the Promise Ring, opting to place their subject matter in a more appropriate
    musical setting.  For the New End Original, this means sub-par renditions of
    whatever Mark Kozelek threw into his dumpster yesterday evening.</p><p>
    
    I'll tip my hat to the romantics out there who maintain the belief that anything
    written in an overtly emotional state is not only the most honest reflection of
    character, but is also capable of purging your sores and sins in a way that
    only an authentic artistic realization can.  Still, relying exclusively on the
    hackneyed pop-punk formula and poetry that raises Billy Corgan to the upper
    echelons of American literature reflects a sort of self-involvement which, in
    all likelihood, got Jonah's ass kicked on the playground after lunch, and on
    the way to practice today.</p><p>
    
    So yeah, <em>we</em> created this monster. The optimist in me wants to say that
    the almost childlike simplicity found in the execution, song structure, and
    lyrical content reflect the honest sentiments of a band baffled and disoriented
    by the complexity of day-to-day living. The pessimist?  Well, he took his own
    life seconds after hearing, ""Do I have something to hide/ Who am I to say/ I'm
    lonely as a leper.""</p></div>"|5764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5764-thriller/|3.3|Kevin Adickes

    Ladies and gentleman: this CD, truly one of the most unusual ever
    compiled, contains sounds which under no circumstances should be
    heard by anyone with a heart condition, or anyone who is easily
    upset.  We urgently recommend that if you are such a person, or the
    parent of a young or impressionable child now, that you and the child
    remove your headphones immediately.</p><p>
    
    There are 37 titles being presented on this release that we would
    sincerely like to warn you about.  The titles include ""Blood Feast,""
    ""Tongue Torn Out,"" ""Get Off the Road,"" ""Blast Off Girls Rock 'n' Roll
    Party"" and ""Brains Knocked Out.""  These are, without exception, the
    bloodiest, goriest songs ever produced.  If you are the least bit
    squeamish, do not attempt to listen.  We've told you about many
    horrific CDs you probably got a big kick out of, but these are
    different.  If you have an impressionable teenager, under no
    circumstances let him or her see it.  Absolutely no children will be
    allowed to hear this.  All of these titles are in mono, which even
    makes the horror more palpable.</p><p>
    
    We are sincere in warning you about this music.  The titles, again,
    include ""Poolside Frolic"" and ""How Dry I Am,"" and they are honestly
    the goriest music ever produced!  Hear them if you must, but we
    wanted you to know what to expect.</p><p>
<em>[Dim lights. Curtain.]</em></p><p>
    
    ""And now, some tragic local news.  We have a report of another murder
    tonight.  Another girl has been found dead in Rogers Park.  The body
    was badly mutilated.  Because of these murders, police request that
    all women stay inside their homes after dark.  If you must go out,
    please have someone accompany you.  Keep your door locked.""</p><p>
    
    The ominous kettledrum pounds increasingly faster, like a funeral
    march running downhill, ever quicker, losing control, until-- a
    shriek!  A roller-rink, soap opera organ plays the chords of terror,
    filling in whatever breathing space you might have left.  And then,
    quiet.  The wry kettledrum reappears, as if to warn us of impending
    danger.  Solemn, forceful trombone plays the tune, solo of the grim
    reaper, accompanied now by equally grim piano and cello.  But then, a
    note of hope: the piano tumbles down the scale, ending on the
    augmented chords of doom.  There can be no light in Herschell Gordon
    Lewis' world of tragic gore!</p><p>
    
    All alone he ponders how to make the movies that popularize his brand
    of grade-Z horror-- for it is but grade-Z, the last refuge for the
    semi-talented and largely penniless alike, that could hope to keep
    this kind of indecency far from impressionable eyes and ears.  Lewis
    would write, direct and produce his cinematic works of uncommon
    devastation for the deranged audience so hungry for fresh flesh.  And
    he would also compose music so truly terrifying, only those with
    stomachs of iron (and perhaps a penchant for lo-fi trash culture)
    could hope to remain unaffected.</p><p>
    
    Classic 1960s films such as <em>Blood Feast, Living Venus, Two
    Thousand Maniacs</em> and <em>She-Devils on Wheels</em> contain the
    music we strongly urge you and your loved-ones to think twice before
    hearing.  For who could fend off the dreadful organ stylings, replete
    with scatological bass-trombone interruptions, of ""Critical
    Condition""?  What chances have you and yours against the dubious
    garage rock, doubling as damning social commentary of ""The Pill""?
    What, is that a baby's cry I hear?  Truly horrifying, ladies and
    gentlemen.  To add to the confusion and fright, Lewis has drafted
    authentic mountain musicians to realize his terrible bluegrass
    visions for films like <em>Moonshine Mountain</em>, and captured the
    wild, hormonal frenzy of youth for the modern-day rock and roll of
    ""Get Off the Road"".  Please, do not remain on the road if you are at
    all susceptible to motorbike collisions!</p><p>
    
    Yes, there are islands on which to rest amongst the sea of terror.
    ""Living Venus"" is a classic ballad; calling to mind the great
    composers Liberace, Welk and Torme, and featuring the warbly croon
    (and what a horrible warble it is) of Lewis himself!  The beautiful,
    recurring virtuoso guitar of ""Recurring Virtuoso Guitar Bit""
    fiendishly wears down your guard for the following organ and piano
    nightmare of ""Lister's Garbage.""  If there is one thing you can be
    sure of, it's that Lewis has taken great care in the arrangements,
    even when he was the only musician available to perform the
    horrendous melodies.  As he says, ""I'm no Paul McCartney, posing and
    posturing as though I'm a serious composer"", so please prepare for
    the unadulterated emotion (or possibly last-minute filler-material)
    with which he has so masterfully impregnated this music.</p><p>
    
    As a final warning, we want to remind you that women and innocent
    children should not attempt to listen to this music without ample
    precaution.  Even grown men have been known to run in terror from the
    horrifically fruity flute of ""Quicksand"".  Do not make the mistake of
    thinking you've heard it all, and are therefore immune.  We may have

    recent Luaka Bop compilation of the ""best of"" the 1960s psychedelic
    tropicalia band Os Mutantes. If you'll recall, Brent raved about them a
    couple of weeks back, hyping their use of the Beatles' <i>White Album</i>
    recording techniques three years before the Fab Four had even conceived
    that album's existence. He was right, too-- Os Mutantes pretty much got
    it goin' on. I urge fans of recent Stereolab and Beck LPs to make a
    journey to the record store, posthaste. (Fuckin' do it, then!)</p><p>
    Tom Ze's one of those 60's tropicalia guys. That's the blinding flash of 
    brilliance I'm able to present on Ze's musical background. Y'know, he
    worked the same scene as Os Mutantes and Brazilian genius Caetano Veloso,
    drawing influences from everything from bossa nova and samba to American
    protest songs and Morricone soundtracks. But you know remixes these days--
    they're not concerned with maintaining the original feel and emotion of
    the music. Rather, today's remixers take minor elements from the LP
    versions and warp them with experimentation. The end product is invariably
    a completely new track that incorporates a few samples from the original
    song.</p><p>
    This is fine by me, as long as the remixers are competent musicians that 
    can produce something that is not only worth listening to, but that the 
    original artist would deem worthy of bearing their name. In the case of 
    <i>Postmodern Platos</i> (I don't think they're referring to Dana Plato, 
    better known as Kimberly from ""Diff'rent Strokes""-- God rest her soul), 
    we've got five fantasmoid remixes, and a straight, previously unreleased 
    Ze track.
    </p><p>
    The selection of artists remixing Ze's material is top-shelf, if a bit
    predictable. It opens with the High Llamas' gurgly, liquid Squirm-style
    take on ""Defect 2: Curiosidade."" The keyboards are distinctly Americanized 
    tropicalia, with jazz organs and studio effects that, at times, seem to 
    have shot forth from the skilled hands of Nigel Godrich. Tortoise's John
    McEntire's version of the same song follows the Llamas' track nicely, 
    incorporating Brazilian acoustic guitar, a solid bassline, an advanced 
    samba rhythm and Ze's organic vocals and pitch-perfect harmonies.
    </p><p>
    Sean Lennon's rendition of ""Defect 5: O Olho Do Lago"" sounds decent 
    enough, even if his ideas are somewhat amateurish and obvious (the sample
    of the electric drill was more effectively executed by-- and I hate to say
    it-- Ministry, on the opening track of 1989's <i>The Mind is a Terrible
    Thing to Taste</i>). But Lennon's obviously spent some much-needed time 
    familiarizing himself with the expensive recording equipment that dad's 
    legendary recordings paid for. He delivers a slow, punching hip-hop beat 
    for the first part of the track, and all-out pre-programmed jungle rhythms
    for the second.
    </p><p>
    Amon Tobin turns in some predictably spaced-out, jazzy Brazilian 
    drum-n-bass for his remix of-- you guessed it-- ""Defect 
    2: Curiosidade."" Despite the fact that we've already heard two versions of
    the song by this point, Tobin's beats are undeniably refreshing when
    pitted against the comparitively stale drum tracks of previous
    cuts. When, four minutes into the almost seven- minute- long nebulaic
    journey, Tobin breaks out his trademark frenzied rhythmic assault, he
    casually casts off the best one- and- a- half minutes <i>Postmodern
    Platos</i> has to offer.
    </p><p>
    Sasha Frere-Jones, who you may recognize from his full-time outfit, Ui, or
    from the pages of <i>Spin</i> Magazine, dishes up the EP's last remix-- a
    head-bobbing, mellow spin on ""Defect 1: Gene"" complete with breathy female
    vocals. But I can't really be of much help in assessing the quality of
    Ze's non-album track, ""Canudos,"" since I'm not yet familiar with his 
    latest Luaka Bop long-player, <i>Fabrication Defect</i>, the album the 
    original versions of these songs appear on. I will mention, however, that
    its angular guitar part and ""hillbilly violin"" are enough to make me have
    to pee.  Take it how you will.
    </p><p>
<i>Postmodern Platos</i> works on two levels: it can be experienced by Tom
    Ze fanatics as an opportunity to hear hip scenesters' interpretations of a
    tropicalia legend's latest work, or by hip scenesters who know nothing 
    about the guy but are looking for an affordable helping of post-rock and
    drum-n-bass.  You decide which.

Man, that shit was fucked up.
    The music was all crazy and foreign-soundin', Mario resembled a little turd
    with legs, the villains were funny-looking ripoffs of the villains in the real
    Mario games, Mario rode in a submarine, and when you got the fireball it bounced
    all over the friggin' screen (well, all two inches of it, anyway).</i></p><p>
    
    My point is two-fold. One: <em>Super Mario Land</em> really was, in many ways, a
    sub-par addition to an otherwise fine series of side-scrolling video games.
    Two: those Game Boys sure can make some crazy noises. The latter is the
    principal upon which Nanoloop operates. A real-time sound synthesis program
    which fits into a Game Boy and makes loop-based music with its four sound
    cards, Nanoloop is a video-game-nerd-turned-music-nerd's dream come true. And
    in case you were wondering, yes, it really can make some pretty interesting
    music.  Basically a $15 advertisement for the Nanoloop program, Disco Bruit's
    <em>Nanoloop 1.0</em> compilation consists of fourteen tracks composed with the
    program. But while there are a few winners, it's still a pretty lackluster
    example of what's possible with the program.</p><p>
    
    AGF/DLay's ""Still Eatin'"" is a dark, foreboding track that manages to sound very
    little like its source. It creeps along through murky ambience, slowly building
    in intensity with percussive blips occasionally cutting through the tension.
    Felix Kubin takes the exact opposite approach with ""Ich Traume Nur in Super-8,""
    crafting nothing less than traditional video game music: the kind you'll swear
    you've already heard a thousand times, no doubt the theme to that one level in
    that game with the shooting things.</p><p>
    
    Blectum from Blechdom manage to retain their self-assured goofiness, perfectly
    replicating their personality on ""Burbanked,"" even as they use nothing but
    simple tones. It's an amusing track-- though, like much of the duo's work, it
    may be a bit too repetitive for its own good.  Bruno &amp; Michet Are Smiling's
    ""Everyday Bodymarket"" is a hilarious take on hardcore punk, with shrieking
    vocals, cheap synth melodies in place of guitars and machine-gun style-effects
    in place of quick drum rolls.  Stock, Hausen &amp; Walkman's ""Pillion Passenger""
    is pretty solid, alternating between a pulsing gurgle that almost resembles a
    driving house bassline and abstract tones that remind me of Nobukazu Takemura's
    sparsest moments.</p><p>
    
    There are some quality tracks here, but eventually one can't help but ask: would
    this be at all interesting if I didn't know it all came out of a Game Boy?  In
    many cases, the answer is a definite no.  Oddly enough, most of the really weak
    moments actually come from the bigger names.  Merzbow contributes what I can
    safely call one of his most painfully repetitive tracks in recent memory. For
    ""nloopcbn,"" Pita piles an unheard of number of static tracks on top of one
    another, then plops a whole bunch of goofy, same-sounding, go-nowhere loops on
    top.  Perhaps most telling is Oliver Wittchow's ""Fragment,"" which places
    electronic farts atop a pretty, ambient pattern made up warm, repeated tones
    (not unlike those that appear in much of the recent laptop work of Jim O'Rourke).
    At one minute and 25 seconds in, the piece cuts off, because (according to the
    liner notes) the DAT broke.</p><p>
    
    Unprofessional?  Maybe.  Silly, even?  Sure.  But then this is music made on
    effin' Game Boys for Christ's sake!  And that's the beauty of Nanoloop (the
    program) and the problem with <em>Nanoloop</em> (the compilation) all wrapped up
    in one tight package.  As a musical instrument, it is completely devoid of
    pretension.  After all, how seriously can anyone take sounds coming out of an
    8-bit handheld video game system?  It's a simple program-- the kind capable of
    making cool sounds in almost anyone's hands. That's right, you and I are just
    as capable of making interesting sounds and patterns with Nanoloop as the
    world's most accomplished musicians.  And so, while there are a few worthwhile
    tracks here, my suggestion to you is this: save your fifteen bucks, dig through
    your childhood closet for your long-neglected electronic friend, go pick up the
    program, and start making some video game music of your own.</p></div>"|1945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1945-nanoloop-10/|6.4|David M. Pecoraro

    Sweden and are now preparing to take America with their so-called 'punk rock
    avec kaboom.'  Like the Ramones-- if there had already been a Ramones
    before them-- or a Stooges who learned to make noise and then showed no more
    curiosity about it, the Hives dish out power-punk that's totally predictable,
    but will knock your ass around your hips and blow the gel out of your hair.</p><p>
    
    The Hives are as tight as their groupies' pleather miniskirts, and they run as
    smoothly as a Japanese sports coupe: zippy, efficient, and they never need to
    go in for repairs.  Drummer Chris Dangerous bangs the skins like a helicopter,
    and Howlin' Pelle Almqvist has a steady scream, with just one gimmick: every
    so often he lets his voice crack into a yelp, like someone just kicked him.
    ""Got ouAYYYEt wayAYYE late... in 200AYYYYYEEE8!""  The guitars are loud but a
    little textbook-- when they're asked for power chords on ""Main Offender,"" they
    deliver exactly like you'd expect.  And those chords have made ""Main Offender""
    their big worldwide single, though for my money ""Outsmarted"" has the better
    hook and will get you jumping higher. Plus, instead of ""outsmarted,"" it sounds
    like they sing ""I farted,"" which is almost avant-garde in its crassness compared
    to the genteel 1950s tone of the other lyrics.</p><p>
<em>Veni Vidi Vicious</em> was first released two years ago and immediately took
    Sweden by storm, but it's just now breaking in the States.  The band is riding
    on the coattails of the garage-rock revival, though this band has been at it
    since the Strokes were too young to understand their own name: nine years, dating
    back to when they were teenagers.  Fans of the quintet's debut, <em>Barely Legal</em>,
    will notice that the Hives have slowed a little with age.  That album sounded
    more like straight suburban hardcore, and the great early song titles like
    ""a.k.a. I-D-I-O-T"" and ""Hail Hail Spit 'n' Drool"" gave way to the comparatively
    wizened ""Die, All Right!"" and ""Knock Knock.""  Not to mention ""Supply and Demand,""
    which even predicts their fame in post-Strokes America. Kicking off with the
    monster-movie chords of ""The Hives - Declare Guerre Nucleaire,"" they bang through
    twelve tunes in thirty minutes-- some of them indistinguishable from one another,
    but at that pace who cares? </p><p>
    
    As on <em>Barely Legal</em>, all of the songs spring from 'Randy Fitzsimmons,'
    the only mysterious thing about the band.  The mythology of the Hives states
    that Fitzsimmons is the Svengali-like manager who got them together and writes
    their material.  Hundreds of people are arguing right now about who Fitzsimmons
    is and whether he's real: if it's an actual guy using a pseudonym, or a guy who
    has that name but can't be found, or if one or all of the Hives write everything
    and they just made up the name.  Even <em>New Musical Express</em> has weighed in
    on this issue (they think it's guitarist Nicholaus Arson).  Maybe the story is
    some kind of statement, their way of half-jokingly saying they're a manufactured
    supergroup-- a Swedish punkcore N*SYNC.  Not that it matters much; this is
    punk rock, not the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p><p>
    
    But the Fitzsimmons legend also reveals what's flawed about the band-- that
    they sound like five guys who took up garage-rock, instead of a band that
    actually played in a garage.  Instead of coming from noise and chaos, they're
    rooted in pastiche and show business, as evidenced by their cover of Jerry
    Butler's 1960s tune ""Find Another Girl.""  Your parents might dig this album as
    much as you do.  For that reason, I like them both a little more and a little
    less than their supposed peers-- they're more entertaining, but maybe less fun.
    When they tour the States in the next couple of months, I'm going to check my
    own theory on who Fitzsimmons is: I'm betting he's the guy that meets them
    backstage, sticks the wind-up keys in their backs and tightens their springs to
    the breaking point before dropping them in front of the crowd.  ""FAAAAAYYYYEEind
    another girl!  ALL RIGHT!""</p></div>"|3890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3890-veni-vidi-vicious/|7.4|Chris Dahlen

I'd wager there are quite
    a few minds going to California right now, maybe northern Australia or Hawaii.
    I'd also wager that there's not a single one of you out there thinking about
    Croatia.  Maybe it's just the recent civil conflict that still lingers in the
    air there, or the Cold War-inspired perception of Eastern Europe as a perpetually
    cold, bleak place, but Croatia doesn't get much credit for its fine Adriatic
    beaches outside of the countries immediately surrounding it.</p><p>
    
    I don't know much about the surfing conditions in Croatia, but
    regardless of what they are, as far as the Bambi Molesters are
    concerned it may as well be Zuma Beach.  <em>Sonic Bullets</em> is a
    surf album as pure as they come, drenched in spring reverb twenty
    fathoms deep, and indebted more deeply to Duane Eddy's twang than you
    are to your creditors.  All the horrifying visions of human hands
    defiling the purity of helpless forest animals conjured by the band's
    name pretty much melt away upon seeing the album cover, which
    features a stylized blue-hued photo of a barefoot, campy/sexy spy
    girl sneaking around behind an obtrusive, Ventures-style typesetting.
    Right there, you pretty much know what you're in for.</p><p>
    
    What's really surprising is just how good the music is.  The
    Molesters crash out of the gate at full tilt with the excellent
    ""Theme From Slaying Beauty,"" a tune that would sit nice and tight
    next to anything off of Dick Dale's <em>King of the Surf Guitar</em>.
    There are no gimmicky little samples from Japanese monster movies a
    la Man or Astro-Man?, just spirited throwback surf that behaves
    largely like irony never existed.  ""Malaguena"" up the ante by adding
    the Spanish-influenced trumpet work of guest Boris Mohoric to the
    fray, as the dual-guitar assault of Dalibor Pavicic and Dinko
    Tomljanovic moves in tidal washes around him.  The gravity of bassist
    Lada Furlan and drummer Hrvoje Zaborac's rhythm section drags
    everything along like a stiff, deadly undertow.</p><p>
    
    Though <em>Sonic Bullets</em> was largely recorded in Slovenia, the
    band also spent some time in Seattle, apparently befriending the
    Minus 5's Scott McCaughey, who contributes organ, vibes, piano,
    tubular bells and even bass harmonica to nearly half of the album's
    tracks.  Fellow Minus 5-er Peter Buck adds some guitar and fuzz bass
    here and there as well, though he also does his best not to
    overshadow the already able band.</p><p>
    
    Buck's star power might shift a few more units for the Bambi
    Molesters, but it's McCaughey whose contributions are really worth
    noting.  His bells on ""Ice &amp; Pinewood Trees"" significantly up the
    song's creepiness factor, as though Chris Eckman of the Walkabouts'
    deadpan monologue about hitchhiking to the ocean wasn't enough.  It
    follows the album's only other vocal track, ""El Corazon Del Loco
    Jorge,"" which features a Spanish narrative courtesy of Eduardo
    ""Speedo"" Martinez of Finnish garage punks the Flaming Sideburns (you
    can't make this stuff up, folks).</p><p>
    
    Though these two songs are interesting diversions, the band is
    generally at their best when they concern themselves with the primary
    task at hand: making great instrumental rock that transcends the
    kitsch that colors modern surf.  Most good surf has some sort of edge
    to it, but a few of the slower songs here actually sound a bit
    mournful-- something that's exceedingly rare in the genre.  It makes
    sense, of course, given that the band members all came of age during
    an extremely tumultuous time in their country's history, and it adds
    a dense of depth that makes the album more engaging.  Whereas, say,
    Man Or Astroman?'s fine cover of Larry Weed's ""Bombora"" was simply
    frenzied and wild, the Molesters infuse it with a dark energy absent
    from any other version I've heard.</p><p>
    
    Strong originals like ""Tremble &amp; Shake"" take this even further,
    sometimes to the point of sounding downright menacing.  ""Final Wave
    for the Day"" has a wonderfully sad minor-key melody juxtaposed with
    manic rhythms and boisterous playing, while ""Double Danger"" drips
    with the edgy paranoia of a great spy theme.  Finally, there's the
    steadily creeping closer ""Chaotica,"" shrouded in McCaughey's vibes
    and piano while Buck, Pavicic, and Tomljanovic each stake out their
    own territories, one offering texture with backward strums and volume
    swells, another comping chords and the third picking out a smoky lead
    line.  Beautiful stuff.</p><p>
    
    Thus ends one of the most terrific surf records I've heard in ages--
    the best at least since Man Or Astroman?'s <em>Experiment Zero</em>.
    Fans of the genre are advised to hastily run out and pick this up.
    It's probably not surprising that the Bambi Molesters are the only
    Croatian group I've ever even heard, but listening to <em>Sonic
    Bullets</em> has me wondering if there's any more unexplored talent
    over there.  For now, I'm thinking I just may call a travel agent and
    see about a beachfront timeshare in Croatia.</p></div>"|538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/538-sonic-bullets-13-from-the-hip/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    nothing lasts long. Works once perceived as masterful often seem
    horribly dated only months later. The glitch-- only recently deemed
    the next big thing-- is now in a state of complete stagnation, with
    no sign of returning to its former glory. Albums thought classic a
    few years ago are laughing matters in the face of new technological
    achievements. Not even a year since most of us first heard names like
    Machine Drum and Prefuse 73, the idea of chopping up vocals is starting
    to sound like yesterday's news. Sure, there's the click-hop movement;
    artists like Akufen and Andreas Tilliander attempting to bring
    something new to the table, to resuscitate the sliced-vocals thing
    with their own unique styles and sounds. But despite their best efforts,
    it seems it won't be long before this too is old news.  Been there,
    done that.</p><p>
    
    Enter Original Instrument. Consisting of all four founding
    members of the Kracfive label, their approach is slightly more
    extreme.  The sounds on this album are comprised 100% of human
    vocals.  The name suggests a back-to-basics approach, a return to
    bare fundamentals, but don't be fooled. Original Instrument isn't
    really about the human voice, but rather those processes used to chop
    it up, distort, maim and manipulate it.  Provided you believe the
    label's claim that the sounds on this album are 100% processed human
    vocals, then indeed Original Instrument stands less as an ode to
    the glory of the human voice than it does to the power of computers
    to manipulate sound.</p><p>
    
    Does the process outshine the art?  Does the music get lost in the
    shadow of the gimmick?  The answer, surprising and pleasing, is 'not
    in the least.'  Original Instrument is damned entertaining from
    start to finish, really a fine piece of electronic music, even if it
    does happen to fit in the oft-maligned category of 'concept album.'
    There's no denying the work that went into <em>Original Instrument</em>.
    The care with which these samples have been chopped up, fucked up,
    pitch-shifted and arranged into something undeniably melodic and
    rhythmic, yet not obviously vocal-based, is prodigious. These guys
    have taken something simple and made a pretty stunning array of
    beats, drones, pops, clicks, tweets, and all kinds of weird
    noises from the most literal of organic sources.</p><p>
    
    Granted, tracks like ""Bop Me"" and ""Nake"" take the obvious approach;
    funny noises, hung loosely from a beat or a rhythm. Anyone whose ever
    spent time fucking with digital audio tracks has heard these sorts of
    sounds before; that vaguely robotic effect that results from
    stretching out or looping a very small chunk of audio. ""Coughio""
    builds beats out of fragments and arranged samples of, well, coughs.
    Even Ferris Bueller could do that. Tracks like these are fun the
    first couple times around, but admittedly, they lose a lot of their
    gusto by the fifth listen.</p><p>
    
    Other tracks are more ambitious. ""Conversong"" is an ambient track
    that sees the masterminds piling a few looped vowels atop one
    another, stretching them out over five minutes, and shifting each of
    their pitches gradually in different directions. ""Heavens to Betsy""
    is Original Instrument's take on an R&amp;B; groove. They layer Cuisinarted
    vocals around a looped sample of a female R&amp;B; singer, and damn if
    it doesn't sound soulful and sexy, even if the backup singers' oohs
    and ahhs end up getting stretched out, hacked to slivers and spattered
    about, like the aural equivalent of a Jackson Pollack painting.</p><p>
    
    Original Instrument is, without a doubt, a one-trick pony. But
    the trick is a pretty good one. And the guys running the show are
    versatile enough to keep it interesting, jumping from beat-driven to
    ambient, from soulful to abstract and back again, all without ever
    sounding too scatterbrained. <em>Original Instrument</em> maintains

    With his band's glory days nearly 20 years behind them, and the Kurt
    Cobain-induced second wind almost a decade gone now, Curt Kirkwood
    has seen fit to release yet another live Meat Puppets album, the
    second since 1999. That's a faster pace than Rush, for crying out
    loud!  But wait, you say-- 1999's <em>Live in Montana</em> documented
    the Pups' original lineup, this one captures the new band. Exactly!
    That's why this album is even less necessary.</p><p>
    
    As a big fan of their initial quartet of albums, I hesitate to even
    call this band the Meat Puppets. The only remaining original member
    is singer/guitarist Curt Kirkwood, drummer Derrick Bostrom having
    hung up his sticks and Curt's brother Cris still in the grips of
    severe drug addiction.  <i>These</i> Meat Puppets sound like a bunch of
    alterna-dudes hired from a Sam Goody in Austin.</p><p>
    
    So who, exactly, needs this?  It seems even diehard Meat Puppet fans
    (and there must be some somewhere) have to be growing weary by this
    point.  At least I'd hope so. The Pups' crumbling legacy has taken a
    hit with each release since 1987's <em>Mirage</em>.  1994's <em>Too High
    to Die</em>-- heralded as a breakthrough upon its release and
    certified gold-- is rivaled only by Sugar's <em>Copper Blue</em> in
    terms of used-bin-clogging alternative rock albums.</p><p>
    
    But if you must know, <em>Live</em> is pieced together from two
    February 2001 live gigs, one at Maxwell's in Hoboken, the other at
    Higher Ground in Winooski, Vermont (I dunno, maybe some ski resort
    was having some kind of deal: play a gig, get a free all-day lift
    pass).  Curt and the replacement Pups draw their set list mainly from
    2000's abysmal <em>Golden Lies</em>-- at least they had the good sense
    to keep their mitts off the classics. But even if for a moment one
    can forget who this band is purporting to be, the songs presented
    here rarely raise above mindless butt-rock and metal-ish alternawank
    that would have sounded incredibly dated in 1994 and sounds even more
    so now.</p><p>
    
    You can't even blame it on a poor recording, that's one of the things
    you can't complain about with this disc. Unfortunately for Kirkwood
    and the boys (as I'm going to call them from now on), this means the
    songs are revealed for what they really are: pure garbage. Kirkwood's
    once-eerie vocal growls are greatly subdued, and most of the fire is
    gone from the formidable guitar playing of yore.</p><p>
    
    There's not much good news to report here. Of the newer songs, ""You
    Love Me"" is a standout if only for its ability to evoke past
    glories, sounding very much like ""Up On the Sun"" (which gets a weak
    re-reading here). But by song's end, the constantly repeated refrain
    just sounds like a pathetic attempt to convince the diehards they're
    not just wasting their time with yet another in a long string of
    disappointing releases.</p></div>"|5197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5197-live/|2.7|Jason Nickey

It's understandable, then, that every     other year or so, a label like Bomp! graces the rock-loving public with yet     another collection of recently unearthed, never-before-heard rough cuts and     demos of Stooges projects that never were. Often, the value of such collections     lies not in the quality of the music itself, but rather in the incidental trivia     that can be gleaned from such recordings.  For example, did you know that the     Stooges actually practiced? Or that Iggy Pop had a recording studio <i>inside     his ass?</i> No?  Well, it's all true-- and <i>Wild Love</i> is here to prove     it.</p>
<p>As suggested above, this most recent release suffers from two major problems:     poor content and pathetic sound quality. First, the problem of content: on the     CD cover, Bomp! dubs <i>Wild Love</i> a ""stunning collection of never-heard     songs, jams, and works-in-progress from the darkest closet of the band that     started it all.""  This is part lie and part euphemism-- it's not stunning, and     most of it essentially sounds like band practice.  The liner notes are a bit     more candid, noting that the disc is composed of various ""false starts and     halfway efforts,"" many of which were ""abandoned along the way.""  Nonetheless,     with barely a straight face, Bomp! would have you believe that <i>Wild Love</i> is an essential look into the Stooges songwriting process, and moreover, that     it's necessary to look into their songwriting process at all.</p>
<p>If your brain is on, you've already noted a problem with this rationale.  Bomp!     says it themselves: the Stooges' songwriting process consisted of arriving at a     studio, filling up on narcotics, then jamming for a few weeks until a song     emerged. Is this so remarkable that it requires its own CD?  Doubtful, especially     given that most of the tidbits documented here never materialized into actual     songs, and sounded as if they never would. But even supposing it <i>were</i> remarkable, embracing such collections sets destructive precedent.  Personally,     I fear the world where bands feel free to peddle recordings of false starts and     band rehearsals.  Remember, Creed practices, too.</p>
<p>Then there's the even greater problem with <i>Wild Love</i>-- its remarkably     poor sound quality.  This collection may as well have been recorded on an     answering machine, or maybe in that ""darkest closet"" where they found/stored     these tapes in the first place.  The tone is muffled, sapping the band of all     its trademark intensity.  Raw, sure, but powerful?  Not by a long shot.</p>
<p>Despite its shortcomings, the disc still has a few high spots. The title track     (not coincidentally, the album-opener) is one of the few completed songs on the     disc.  As with most bands, the Stooges sounded better when they were trying (go     figure) and the song is a testament to that fact.  <i>Wild Love</i> mostly     documents post-<i>Raw Power</i>-era blues jams, pairing Williamson's guitar     noodling (which, although capable, is nonetheless still noodling) with some of     Iggy's most forgettable vocal moments. For example, in ""I Come From Nowhere,""     Pop freestyles off of the title verse, ""I come from nowhere,"" eventually arriving     at the Whitman-esque ""Everybody's a square/ Dirty underwear.""  I see England, I     see France...</p>
<p>There's a whole cache of Stooges material more worthy of your dollars than     <i>Wild Love</i>. Those who own it all won't be dissuaded by this review.  But     unless Bomp!'s suck-up liner notes truly resonate with you, there's little point     to owning this record. Practice makes perfect; so just listen to the perfect     stuff, and leave practice for the fanatics.</p>

I saw you do the double-take: Pitchfork finally decided
    to revisit the <em>Pet Sounds</em> review!  But such is not the case.  Taa-Pet
    means ""wallpaper"" in Hebrew, and while this disc isn't quite Baroque or Rococo,
    that's a closer reference point than pocket symphonies and California girls.
    Press play and hesitant cadences rise, mysterious ringing tones that slowly
    shift in pitch. Bass modulations begin to supplement the near-silence, shuddering
    like the purr of an electric generator.  This is ambient music, of a sort.</p><p>
    
    Taa-Pet is Aviad Albert and Binya Reches.  The duo have been on the Israeli
    music scene for years.  Reches was a founding member of industrial rock force
    Die Welt (no doubt named in part for the German paper).  Albert worked for years
    as a music journalist and as an employee for Kasbah Records, representing foreign
    labels like Warp and Ninja Tune locally.  The Taa-Pet project began as an
    exploration beyond the foreground of music into what might be considered the
    background.  They've found an obliging label in Fact, an offshoot of Jerusalem's
    Balance record store which serves as a clearing house for all kinds of
    experimental music from Israel.</p><p>
<em>TaaPetSounds</em> was composed live on computer with MIDI
    sequencing and sampling; it's a test of minimalism in a pristine
    digital environment.  The three-track ""Cold Sweet Potato"" announces
    itself with only a sine wave.  There's something about its indelible
    arc that sounds so pure, maybe because it's representing itself: the
    sound-wave as a wave of sound.  It's simple and easy to picture, yet
    also elusive by nature, always sounding like it's radiating from
    somewhere besides the speaker.  Faint crackling particles start to
    flicker at the periphery, distracting your attention from the eerie
    whine.</p><p>
    
    Even as hovering helicopter whirs invade, it's hard to shake the
    clinical atmosphere.  If you're listening with headphones, you might
    start to wonder whether this really is just another soundtrack for
    PoMo art galleries.  But then a two-note bass drone descends, casting
    the rest of the elements into contrast.  It's as if all the little
    noises before were just glares of light rippling on a vast sea, and
    then the moon was suddenly obscured so you could see into the depths.
    These elements cycle slowly, forming their own waves of overlapping
    tension, echoing in more extended sequences each time, gradually
    creating a sense of spatiality.  But <em>TaaPetSounds</em> is more than
    just a Reichian experiment in delay.  Reches and Albert leave clues
    that remind you of their improvisational skill, like the random
    bird-squawk synths on ""Do the Wrong Thing,"" and the mournful guitar
    reverb on the following ""Prahey.""</p><p>
    
    Throughout these seven tracks and 45 minutes a patient narrative
    develops, though at first it always seems nothing but noise.  When
    knob-twiddlers are disparaged, it's usually because their
    manipulations are seen as facile; but the Etch of time and the Sketch
    of space are a powerful axis, and when your stylus inks with the most
    basic tones in the electronic palette, less often turns out to be
    more.  ""Anti Virus"" is as evocative as ambient gets, full of
    brain-tingling sine squiggles and massed ethereal keyboards.
    Remember the old Nintendo game ""Metroid""?  When Samus Aran paused to
    rest, these are the sounds she heard in the caverns.</p></div>"|7912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7912-taapetsounds/|7.2|Christopher Dare

Now!|2845.0|The Mountain Goats|['Rock']|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Ajax']|2002-04-23 00:00:00|2002|2016-06-11 21:39:31.014896|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".4hfioe5ji8.1.6:0.1.0.$5452/=1$5452.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>I confess to being totally baffled by the Mountain Goats.  First off, the band is
    officially comprised of several people, though the vast majority of their recordings
    feature only one person: John Darnielle of Southern California.  The others crop up
    as occasional backup singers or additional instrumentalists, but very rarely; more
    often than not these songs are just John playing guitar and singing alone in
    his living room.  Darnielle has revealed in interviews that he becomes very frustrated when hearing his
    recordings described as ""just one guy playing guitar and singing alone in his living
    room"" because he values the invisible input of the other Mountain Goats.  He's complex
    like that.</p><p>
    
    Secondly, the Mountain Goats record their songs on a boombox, on plain old
    cassettes.  I've heard more professional sounding recordings come out of
    answering machines.  I mean, several of their songs end with the clearly
    audible click of the stop button being pressed on that boombox.  There's no
    multitracking, there's horrible distortion and background noise, there are
    dropouts from damaged tape.  And it's been like that for ten years.</p><p>
    
    Third, given an uninterrupted hour in a quiet room, I myself could teach most
    people, including my 11- year- old cousin, to play the guitar with the same
    proficiency as Darnielle.  But when John makes a mistake or plays a sour note
    (which is often) he doesn't yell ""do overs"" and stop the tape.  He finishes the
    song and puts it on a CD.  Sure, he's gotten better over the years, but he still
    makes mistakes.  The striking thing is that he appears to take great pride in them.</p><p>
    
    Fourth, and this is really all you need to know about the Mountain Goats, John
    Darnielle has the singular ability to sing lines that nobody should be able to
    sing straight- faced and make them sound simultaneously absurd, melancholy, and
    absolutely beautiful.  Lines like, ""It's gonna be so nice when the Easter Bunny
    comes,"" or, ""There's a monkey in the basement/ Where did the monkey come from?""</p><p>
    
    Darnielle creates miniature narratives much like those of Jorge Luis Borges:
    small spaces with their own rules, drawing inspiration largely from classical
    sources.  <i>Protein Source of the Future... Now!</i>, a collection of 7"", cassette
    and compilation releases, is chock full of these weird little lines and spaces.
    The veiled menace of ""Night of the Mules,"" the magical realism- cum- western of
    ""Billy the Kid's Dream of the Magic Shoes,"" the one finger Casiotone accompaniment
    on ""Going to Malibu,""-- this album is rotten with lyrics and music that nobody should
    be able to get away with.  But somehow, when Darnielle sings, ""I am evil forest/
    That would kill a man on the day his life seems sweetest to him,""  you believe him.
    And when he plays the same chord for a full twenty seconds at the end of ""Going
    to Tennessee,"" you're bummed when he stops. Because he plays that one chord like
    he means it, godammit, and that's more than you can say about nearly
    everybody else out there.  Rock on, John.  Yeeah!!</p></div>"|5452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5452-protein-source-of-the-future-now/|8.5|Zach Hooker

    stylistic cocktail that mixes indie pop and IDM (let's say the ""I"" stands for
    ""independent"") without compromising either.  The hybridization of rock and
    electronic genres has become a fairly tired musical formula over the last
    several years, but 26-year-old Kristian Craig Robinson executes with such
    precision and innovation that Island Row leaves even the seasoned listener
    slackjawed and struggling for comparisons.</p><p>
    K's music draws from a broad pool of influences, indicative of his
    geographically scattered childhood.  Maltese by birth, he divided his early
    years between Dubai and Borneo, coming eventually to Britain for secondary
    school.  There, Robinson encountered American indie bands like Fugazi and
    Sonic Youth, who inspired him to start his first band.  His background gets a
    bit hazy beyond that point, but his music suggests that, somewhere along the
    line, he ate loads of psychotropic chemicals, picked up a few Rephlex records
    and bought himself a Dictaphone.  All these jumbled elements of his past echo
    forcefully in his work, and more evenly on <i>Island Row</i> than any of his
    previous outings.</p><p>
    Capitol K's recording legacy dates back to 1998, when he released a self-titled
    12"" on Elf Cut Records.  Two of the four tracks from that record made the cut
    for his full-length (the absolutely astounding <i>Sounds of the Empire</i>) on
    Mike Paradinas' Planet \xB5 imprint the following year.  Of that album, Mike
    writes (and I concur), it ""is still one of the best debut albums I have
    heard.""  You might even care to scratch the word debut.</p><p>
    Material from these early releases hints only cautiously at Robinson's
    rock-n-roll leanings.  The follow-up <i>Roadeater</i> EP, issued in early
    2000, signaled a shift toward a more balanced mixture of vocals, samples and
    strumming.  And <i>Island Row</i> carries the torch-- four of the 11 songs
    here have proper lyrics, and nearly all feature a bit of guitar-work.</p><p>
    Still, the prevailing theme here is production; the inane, carnival-esque
    noodlings reminisce of Mouse on Mars, while the occasionally caustic drum
    breaks recall tunes from Autechre's Gescom side-project.  But Capitol K brings
    so much of his own flavor to the table that likening him to either of those
    musicians would be misleading.</p><p>
    Exoticism becomes a key theme in Robinson's work-- not the token ethno-techno
    exoticism of Talvin Singh or Badmarsh &amp; Shri, who intersperse dull drum loops
    with unimaginative sitars and tablas, and earn credit for ""fusing"" different
    genres.  It would be more appropriate to say today's world beat musicians layer
    different genres, always conscious of which sounds belong to the East and
    which belong to the West, and scarcely exploring any middle ground.</p><p>
    Capitol K  breaks this mold, and stakes out a bit of sonic territory somewhere
    in between.  Reversed drum loops bounce between Eastern and Western time
    signatures, while Robinson's candid falsetto brings urgency to even the most
    saccharine lyrics.  Out of context, many of the lyrics seem puerile, which is
    probably what makes them so damn effective.  It wrenches even my calloused
    heart to hear K innocently cry the chorus of the opening track, ""Heat.""  ""I'd
    like to know/ If you like the cold/ 'Cause when we meet/ I'll bring the heat.""
    On paper, it reads like a nursery rhyme, but the latent angst beneath Robinson's
    voice tells a more frustrated story-- one of a lost passion.</p><p>
    ""Pillow,"" which also made an appearance on <i>Roadeater</i>, seems the most
    readily accessible song of the lot.  Even while treading through bubblegum
    turf, it manages to retain its edge and subtlety, thanks to Robinson's
    production trickery.  But gems lurk in the album's darker corners as well.
    ""Monster,"" as the name might suggest, can be at times difficult and abrasive,
    matching heavy guitar distortion with esoteric Eastern melodies.  Other
    honorable mentions include ""Breakers,"" ""Lion Anon"" and ""Forgotten Duffle Coat,""
    on which K collaborates with friend Leafcutter John.</p><p>
    The album loses points for two reasons, the most legitimate being that a
    handful of the tracks feel disjointed.  Capitol K's transitions tend to be
    remarkably smooth, but there are several on this album (particularly on the
    songs ""God Ohm"" and ""Is It U?"") that it seems he might simply have handled
    better.  The second complaint I'm obligated to lodge against <i>Island Row</i>
    is a reprimand for the Prince cover, ""Dance On.""  Robinson admits he intended
    it as a joke, but thanks to American copyright laws, that joke prohibited
    Americans from importing this brilliant record for nearly four months.  I
    could have done without the inconvenience, especially for this lackluster
    song.</p><p>
    I hope I've done this album justice, but it's tough to tell when so many
    terrible albums receive so much critical lip service.  If my generic praise
    leaves you with the impression that <i>Island Row</i> is generic music, do
    yourself a favor and dig up some MP3s.  These songs deserve to be heard.</p></div>"|1291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1291-island-row/|8.4|Malcolm Seymour III

    high standards for themselves, yet consistently fails to achieve
    them?  Probably, but that doesn't stop Radio 4's second effort,
    <em>Gotham!</em>, from being a big fat letdown.  It's not a bad album
    by most standards-- in fact it's pretty good at points-- but in the
    end slides into a mire of adequacy after generating high expectations
    early on.</p><p>
    
    Radio 4's roots are firmly planted in the rich tradition of British
    post-punk, lest anyone forget.  And of course, whenever a band makes
    such an obvious approach toward genre that's been explored by some of
    the most influential bands of the past twenty-five years, they can't
    help but invite negative comparison.</p><p>
    
    The band has yet to return the sound they borrowed from post-punk
    luminaries the Gang of Four for their first album, <em>The New Song
    and Dance</em>, though on this go-round, they've managed to flesh out
    the standard battery of clanging, jagged guitar bursts and dance
    rhythms with more prominent electronic elements and a little funk,
    to almost uniformly positive effect. They still remain fairly
    derivative, but at least here, unlike on <em>The New Song and
    Dance</em>, they demonstrate the ability to bring some nuances
    to a familiar sound.  Understated but well-placed sequencers
    on ""Our Town,"" the impressive and sweeping album opener, work.
    The bite-sized funk riffs littering the album (most prominent
    on the energetic and genuinely entertaining ""Eyes Wide Open"" and
    ""Calling All Enthusiasts"") make it easier to remember that you aren't
    listening to some strange Mission of Burma or Wire B-sides.</p><p>
    
    It's nice enough, but frankly, the album's energy is spent after the
    first 25 minutes, and the second half of the album feels like an
    aftershock from the impact of the first seven songs.  Both of the
    real standouts on the album, ""Save Your City"" (the only truly melodic
    offering on <em>Gotham!</em>), and ""Speaking in Codes"" (a dark, nearly
    guitar-free offering) are tossed directly into the center of the
    album.  Musically, it's thoroughly, thoroughly passable, although
    every once in a while the guitar work breaks to the fore to
    pleasantly take control of a tune, and the bass is particularly solid
    and driving throughout, if a bit generic.</p><p>
    
    It's a crying shame though that bassist/vocalist Anthony Roman's
    voice is wasted on such award-losing lyrics.  On nearly every track,
    the complexities of such issues as activism, economic power
    determining the status quo, and various other 'revolutionary' ideas
    are approached with all of the verbal subtlety of an eighth grader
    with an anarchy symbol stitched onto his backpack.  Despite the
    criticisms, if I had heard only the first seven tracks, this could've
    made some big points.  <em>Gotham!</em> is decent, catchy, and

    the lyrics and musical attitude.  As a highly respected and highly
    paid music critic, it's my job to sniff out these themes and present
    them to you, the reader.  After spending some quality time listening
    to Luna's sixth album, taking extensive notes, and applying the most
    complex theories of musicology, I think I have unlocked
    <em>Romantica</em>'s secret: Dean Wareham be getting laid!</p><p>
    
    Of course, I have absolutely no concrete facts to back this up--
    it's a conclusion based on equal parts hunch and dirty mind.
    Nevertheless, I haven't heard a collection of songs this infused
    with post-coital glow since Björk's heavy-breathing exercise
    <em>Vespertine</em>.  But while Ms. Gudmundsdottir's love songs are set
    in the wintery climate of her home country, Wareham pens tunes
    appropriate to the album's springtime shimmer, images of lovestruck
    springs and summer picnics in the park.</p><p>
    
    I mean, come on, the album's called <em>Romantica</em>, the cover art
    is a Caribbean souvenir cigarette lighter, and the leadoff track's
    name is ""Lovedust,"" for crying out loud.  While a song called
    ""Lovedust"" that talks about seeing ""a million, billion, trillior
    stars"" could just as easily be about the demon cocaine, the Jimmy
    Buffett-style guitar effects and the ""air is creamy/ You look
    so dreamy"" lyrics suggest otherwise. Throw in the sultry backing
    vocals of super-hott new bass player Britta Phillips, and you've
    got the indie rock world's answer to that steamy Robbie Williams/Nicole
    Kidman duet.</p><p>
    
    Not that the majority of <em>Romantica</em> is much of a sonic
    departure from Luna's back catalog, a series of albums that don't
    feature much in the way of experimentation. Wareham's songwriting
    formula has varied little since his hyper-influential days in Galaxie
    500: hazy minor chord vamps behind his thinly wistful singing voice.
    Since the peak of this approach on the band's classic
    <em>Penthouse</em>, Luna have made a number of small attempts to
    stretch out their sound, but Wareham's easily recognizable voice kept
    the songs from deviating too much from the mean.</p><p>
    
    The same appraisal goes for <em>Romantica</em>, despite the presence of
    esteemed producer Dave Fridmann; nobody's going to be fooled into
    thinking this isn't a Luna album.  Fridmann's influence is remarkably
    subtle, wisely keeping his characteristic thick drum sound to a
    minimum to preserve the band's slight aesthetic.  Only the grandiose
    ""Black Champagne,"" with it's orchestra-in-a-can strings swelling
    <em>Soft Bulletin</em>-style around Wareham's plea to ""train the
    disco lights on me"" overtly reveals his presence behind the boards.</p><p>
    
    What separates the album from previous Luna product is not so much
    instrumental alterations as the newly unabashed sentimentality of
    Wareham's lyrics.  The twelve songs find Wareham largely rhapsodizing
    about food, love, or both, with stanzas like ""Salt and pepper
    squid/ And Singapore noodles/ I could look at your face/ For
    oodles and oodles,"" from ""Renee Is Crying.""  Okay, yeah, wher
    written out, lines like that probably have you puking on your
    computer monitor.  But if anything can pull it off without
    triggering the gag reflex, it's Wareham's doe-eyed voice, which
    practically has cartoon hearts bouncing around it.</p><p>
    
    The band, meanwhile, further brightens the mood with ""ba ba ba""
    backing vocals and arrangements more peppy and muscular than or
    previous efforts.  Phillips' vocals contribute the most obvious new
    elements, tradingoff singing with Wareham on ""Mermaid Eyes,"" the
    band's sexiest song since <em>Penthouse</em>'s cover of Serge
    Gainsbourg's ""Bonnie and Clyde"" with Laetitia Sadier.
    Instrumentally, the quartet have never sounded so confidently loose,
    with nearly every song spiraling off into guitar soloing sessions
    that would perk up the ears of jamband followers, were they not faded
    out after a minute or two.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the album takes a dive after the first seven tracks
    into less memorable territory, without a big ending like ""Bonnie
    and Clyde"" or <em>The Days of Our Nights</em>' clever ""Sweet
    Child O' Mine"" cover.  Chances are you'll hardly notice,
    however, as by this time the album has lured you into its fuzzy
    trap.  With <em>Romantica</em>, Luna shows that they know their
    sound and their place: nothing too fancy, just solid, cheerful
    music for barbecue romance and driving with the windows down.</p></div>"|4914.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4914-romantica/|7.8|Rob Mitchum

    assigning kitsch value to various pockets of humanity.  The
    line between 'nostalgia' and 'bad taste' is incredibly thin.
    Whereas whole genres, turns-of-phrase, and iconic allusions to
    fads of yore tend to erratically resurface on the pop-culture
    landscape, other seemingly perfect candidates for revivalist
    lampooning lie dormant, unscathed by the trials of time.</p><p>
    
    2002 seems to be ground zero for kitsch-- the two most notable
    revivals of the moment being Gary Coleman and the commercial
    media's preoccupation with 1980s music. Like every red-blooded,
    patriotic American, I enjoy a good laugh at Gary's expense.
    He's certainly kept our nation together during these trying and
    uncertain times.  Yet, the chances of him ever being regarded
    as a serious actor are slimmer than the chances of a new-wave
    renaissance.</p><p>
    
    While My Morning Jacket have always steered clear of campiness,
    <em>Chocolate and Ice</em> finds the group taking a few steps
    back from their recent triumphs.  This is an exploratory EP
    that really serves as a vehicle for the group's 24-minute epic
    ""Cobra,"" a stark, predominantly instrumental composition that
    bears a remarkable resemblance to the Steve Miller Band's 1982
    ode to sexuality in the world of professional magic, ""Abracadabra.""
    To their credit, My Morning Jacket manage to carry this song for
    nearly its entire duration-- a feat only a handful of other groups
    might be capable of-- but the fact remains that bad 80s synth
    does not make for a good source of inspiration.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, the rest of the EP is more eclectic and rewarding.
    Opener ""Can You See the Hard Helmet on My Head?"" transcends its
    embarrasingly bad title to find My Morning Jacket taking musical
    cues from Jeff Tweedy and company.  It's here that Jim James'
    whiskey-soaked voice, one of the group's strongest assets, is
    at its finest-- wavering between reassurance and aching
    desperation while hiding behind a dozen or so coats of reverb.</p><p>
    
    Though these guys have always been relatively sparse in their
    arrangements, <em>Chocolate and Ice</em> takes the 'less-is-more'
    philosophy further than any of the group's previous efforts,
    possibly as a cautionary measure against the muddy production
    value.  The dynamic is intriguing, to say the least, as tracks
    like ""Sweetheart"" and ""Sooner"" pay homage to the 'couples only'
    dance music of the 1950s-- think Patsy Cline, Buddy Holly, and
    Roy Orbison.  My Morning Jacket are just convincing enough to
    make the repressed adolescent in me cry right along with them
    sometimes.</p></div>"|5532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5532-chocolate-and-ice-ep/|7.3|Kevin Adickes

On
    April 23rd, <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> finally emerges into
    the light of day, having spent the last year interred in its
    own cluttered mythology: a hermetic studio gestation, with the
    inscrutable guidance of Chicago ex-pat/kindly wizard, Jim
    O'Rourke; internecine squabbles; conflict and resolution with
    American media behemoth AOL Time Warner; the release portentously
    slated for September 11th, but mysteriously delayed; the
    indecipherable short-wave radio prophecies; and, eventually,
    the hero's welcome, with the first stirrings of spring. It's all
    there: the miracle birth; the unlikely hero; the, um, benevolent
    mentor; the primordial menace; good over evil. Joseph Campbell
    would be pissing himself if he weren't dead.</p><p>
    
    The miraculous birth narrative of Wilco's fourth album, <i>Yankee
    Hotel Foxtrot</i>, is already old hat: banished from straightedge
    AOL Time Warner imprint Reprise on the cosmically short-sighted
    judgment of label executives who deemed the album a ""career-ender,""
    Wilco streamed <i>Yankee Hotel</i> from its left-wing website to
    millions before signing with weirdo progressive AOL Time Warner
    imprint Nonesuch. Long is the way and hard that leads up from
    AOL Time Warner into the light, I guess.</p><p>
    
    But the unique circumstances of <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i>'s
    long deliverance make for more than just pointless disc jockey
    chatter before spinning ""Heavy Metal Drummer.""  The long delay
    and streaming audio conspired to ensure that everyone in the
    world has already heard <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> in part,
    if not in its entirety. Vast digital pre-circulation, corporate
    controversy, and buzz like a beard of bees have rendered all
    reviews afterthoughts at best.</p><p>
    
    But myth is always an afterthought, and these days, the motif I
    like chewing on best is, without question, that of the Unlikely
    Hero. Who would have predicted an album of this magnitude from
    Wilco? As much I love the band, the fact remains that they were
    together for five years before they produced anything that could
    stand with Uncle Tupelo's <i>March 16-20, 1992</i> or <i>Anodyne</i>.
    <i>AM</i> is rather forgettable, while the expansive <i>Being
    There</i>, though frequently inspired, travels on paths blazed
    by Tom Petty on <i>Damn the Torpedoes</i>, if not The Flying
    Burrito Brothers.</p><p>
    
    1999's dolorous <i>Summerteeth</i> was exponentially more
    sophisticated than anything that came before it, though its
    heroin innuendoes, shades of domestic abuse and nocturnal
    homicidal impulses sat somewhat ill at ease alongside the
    album's lush and infectious pop arrangements. Of course,
    <i>Summerteeth</i> was a strange and majestic, albeit dark,
    deviation from the alt-country genre Jeff Tweedy co-invented.
    But since <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i>, it has retroactively
    become more of a harbinger of things to come. Upon being pressed
    by the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> about abandoning alt-country,
    Tweedy dismissively bequeathed the old Wilco sound to Ryan
    Adams.  And you can never go home again.</p><p>
    
    So does <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> justify the controversy,
    delay and buzz?  Everyone, I think, already knows that the
    answer is yes; all I can offer is ""me too"" and reiterate. And
    after half a year living with a bootleg copy, the music remains
    revelatory. Complex and dangerously catchy, lyrically
    sophisticated and provocative, noisy and somehow serene,
    Wilco's aging new album is simply a masterpiece; it is equally
    magnificent in headphones, cars and parties. And as anyone who's
    seen the mixed-bag crowd at Wilco shows knows, it will find a
    home in the collections of hippies, frat boys, acid-eating prep
    schoolers, and the record store apparatchiks of the indiocracy.
    No one is too good for this album; it is better than all of us.</p><p>
    
    But for all the talk of terminally hip influences-- Jim O'Rourke,
    krautrock, and <i>The Conet Project</i>-- <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i>
    still conjures a classic rock radio station on Fourth of July
    weekend. And this extends beyond the alternating Byrds/Stones/Beatles
    comparisons that pepper every Wilco review ever written; <i>Yankee
    Hotel Foxtrot</i> evokes Steely Dan, the Eagles, Wings, Derek &amp;
    The Dominos and Traffic. The slightly disconnected, piano-led
    ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,"" is delicately laced with
    noise, whistles and percussive clutter, like some great grandson
    of ""A Day in the Life."" The muted, ""Kamera"" strums along darkly
    with acoustic and electric guitars; the twittering electronics
    in the background don't quite mitigate the tune's comparability
    to the clever and precise (though now largely neglected)
    jazz-inflected blues-rock of Dire Straits' stunning debut.</p><p>
    
    The cone-filtered and anthemic country psychedelia of ""War on
    War"" could have been jammed straight out of a hot ""Bertha"" at a 1973
    Grateful Dead show. The violin and coked-up country lounge of
    ""Jesus, etc."" recalls some mythical seventies in true love and
    cigarettes. The sharp, stuttering guitar solo that rips open
    ""I'm the Man Who Loves You"" could have come directly out of
    Neil Young's hollow body electric circa <i>Everybody Knows This
    Is Nowhere</i>. For all its aural depth and layering, <i>Yankee
    Hotel</i> tends to come off as earnest as yesteryear's FM radio.
    Wilco gets the benefit of O'Rourke's gift for cutting straight
    to the guts of every style, without the burden of his trademark
    contempt for the subject matter at hand.</p><p>
    
    And Tweedy seems to be coming into his own as a lyricist. I
    still wince when I hear him sing, ""I know you don't talk much
    but you're such a good talker,"" on <i>Being There</i>. The
    brooding introspection of <i>Summerteeth</i> made for a handful
    of elegant lyrics, most notably the skeletal beauty of ""She's a
    Jar,"" where ""she begs me not to miss her"" returns as the stinging
    ""she begs me not to hit her,"" transforming a wistful love song
    into something gently bruising. But on <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i>,
    Tweedy becomes what I think he always was: an optimist and a
    romantic.</p><p>
    
    His declaration of wanting to salute ""the ashes of American
    flags,"" is less cynicism than, perhaps, the devoted liberal's
    nostalgia for an honest patriotism (check out the array of
    properly lefty links at wilcoworld.com if you don't believe
    me).  ""All my lies are always wishes,"" he sings, ""I know I
    would die if I could come back new.""  In ""Jesus, etc.,"" there's
    a cascading simplicity when he sings, ""Tall buildings shake,
    voices escape, singing sad, sad songs to two chords/ Strung
    down your cheeks, bitter melodies turning your orbit around.""
    Sad, celestial and lovely.  The final declaration on <i>Yankee
    Hotel Foxtrot</i> is one of abiding dedication: ""I've got
    reservations 'bout so many things but not about you."" There
    isn't a truer word to be had.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Summerteeth</i>, Tweedy yowled about ""speakers speaking
    in code"" and I thought of that refrain from ""I Can't Stand It""
    when I first heard the words ""yankee-hotel-foxtrot"" uttered by
    the disembodied English woman on the sublimely creepy box-set
    of shortwave radio transmissions, <i>The Conet Project</i>, which
    is sampled sporadically throughout this record.  And in a
    deeper, more deliberate world, perhaps we could trace that
    thread to unravel the secret wonder of Wilco's new album. But
    I don't think there's any secret; and I don't think there's any
    code. Beneath the great story of <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i>,
    there are all the tropes and symbols and coincidences of a
    little mythology; but under that is a fantastic rock record.
    And why tell you? You all already knew this.</p></div>"|8676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8676-yankee-hotel-foxtrot/|10.0|Brent S. Sirota

    a single, gauging the reaction, then recording singles until you
    have enough tried-and-true material to put out an album is a
    good one.  Sure, the creative geniuses of the late 60s and early
    70s, with their orchestral clusterfucks and masturbatory double
    albums, may have balked at this notion.  But most of them were
    forced to operate under the former system until they either a)
    accumulated a fanbase so large and devoted that no one cared
    about being bludgeoned with a twenty-minute keyboard jam with
    extended drum solo; or b) everybody, including the heads of the
    record labels, were so stoned it made no difference anyhow.
    Theoretically, punk rock put an end to this (this requires we
    conveniently forget <i>Sandinista</i>), but the damage had
    already been done. These days bands are expected to come out of
    the gate with fully realized albums.</p><p>
    
    The No-No's, a coed Portland indie-pop quartet, have released the
    musical equivalent of a novella (take your pick-- short album or
    long EP?) called <em>Let Your Shadow Out</em>.  The title track is
    such a bang-up opener, I endangered the lives of all those
    traveling in the eastbound lanes of I-240 early Saturday morning
    (owner of large white truck with the Smiths sticker and Ohio
    plates-- I am truly sorry) when my overt enthusiasm compromised
    my driving skill.</p><p>
<i>Let Your Shadow Out</i> is one of the most perfect two-minute pop songs
    I've heard in a long time, from the bounce of the verses to the growl
    of the choruses. I would be inclined to refer to this as pop-punk--
    the incontestable catchiness of the material (think the Fastbacks on
    a really good day) undercut with Robin Bowser's Cub-like vocals would
    seem to steer it that way.  But for the negative associations (admit
    it: when I say pop-punk, you scoff and think about overproduced
    three-chord wonders from California and the Midwest), I won't.</p><p>
    
    Three out of four bandmembers have full-time gigs with other
    bands, which ensures an odd sort of dynamic: the tightness of
    technically proficient musicians, undercut with a sort of
    off-the-cuff weekend project mentality. That said, there's
    little aural similarity to the Jicks (guitarist Mike Clark),
    the Halo Benders (bassist Ralf Youtz), or Dub Narcotic (drummer
    Heather Dunn) in the No-No's. One might be able to make a
    comparison to Dunn's former projects, Tiger Trap and the Bangs,
    but <em>Let Your Shadow Out</em> is neither as cutesy as the
    former, nor as punk as the latter.</p><p>
    
    There is no other
    track on <em>Let Your Shadow Out</em> that lives up to the promise
    of the first.  My callous first reaction is this: when three-fourths
    of the band is involved with better-known musical projects,
    there's scant time for writing and rehearsing a full album of
    Grade A material for a sideline operation.  On the band's
    website, Bowser-- the only full-time No-No-- laments their
    inability to tour due to conflicting schedules with the other
    members' bands.</p><p>
    
    The more obvious answer may arise from the fact that no other
    song-- save the under-one-minute rant, ""I've Had Enough""--
    matches the tempo of the first.  The other songs aren't bad--
    in fact ""The Strategy"" is a great, retro pop number with nice
    harmonies and some charmingly wry lyrics: ""I'm not the alpha
    female/ I always blow it on the first impression/ I wasn't
    trained to be polite, you know.""  Likewise, the early 60s-influenced
    ""Girlfriend"" has its moments, especially as a vehicle for Robin
    Bowser's vocals, which, in this context, sound a bit like a
    nouveau Lesley Gore, but without the crying.</p><p>
    
    The acoustic ballads (""Empty Bed"" and ""Sunshine"") don't really
    work.  Softer, slower songs exaggerate the imperfections in
    Bowser's voice, and her off-key spunk tends to be lost in the
    translation.  The No-Nos' simplistic arrangement is designed
    for the unruly pop of the faster numbers.  Likewise, the Monkees
    cover, ""Love Is Only Sleeping,"" though fairly well executed,
    doesn't seem particularly well-suited to the strengths of this
    band.</p><p>
    
    The danger of working on a song-by-song basis is the possibility of
    never matching the strength of your best song. The relative obscurity
    of the No-No's no doubt diminishes their chances of landing on the
    next <em>Now THAT's What I Call Music!</em> compilation, but one really
    great song is no small accomplishment.  I could name scores of
    bands with more consistent albums who couldn't put out a good
    single if they tried.  <em>Let Your Shadow Out</em> exhibits the
    kind of infectious, yet prickly sound that characterized a certain
    style of Northwest indie-pop a decade ago (before the musical landscape
    got so subdivided that it seems all I do is hyphenate genres). Not
    revolutionary or challenging. Listening to it won't make you
    smarter, or even make you appear smarter-- it's just good fun.</p></div>"|5821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5821-let-your-shadow-out/|7.1|Alison Fields

I'm 
    thinking of groups like Emperor Penguin, Ladytron and Trans Am, bands 
    that make selecting the <em>style</em> of music -- be it neo-electro, 
    80's rock or synth pop -- the first step in composition. It's weird 
    that these bands never try their hand at straight disco. It's one of 
    the most identifiable genres of music, with plenty of wink-wink 
    potential if that's your angle-- and, well, it's fun. And, if they 
    know what's good for them, genre bands should about fun. I'm happy to 
    report that Louisville's VHS or Beta emerges now to fill the disco 
    void.</p><p>
    
    Yes, VHS or Beta are a four-piece indie band (two guitars, bass and 
    drums) who play disco and nothing but. The graphic on the inside of 
    the CD tells the story.  It's a purple and magenta drawing of four 
    young guys on stage, guitars in hand, performing under a neon ""Le 
    Funk"" sign straight out of that opening shot in <em>Boogie Nights</em>. 
    Confirming the indieness, one of the guys sports a decidedly 
    post-grunge stocking cap and goatee. You might ask yourself why, when 
    there are good house records being released every week, the world 
    needs an instrumental band playing original disco tunes.  Doesn't the 
    DJ booth provide the club entertainment?</p><p>
    
    Well, there are certain qualities to this debut EP made possible only 
    by getting a band in a room. You see, VHS or Beta are also a <em>jam 
    band</em> who happen to play disco, as <em>Le Funk</em>'s closing live 
    tracks make explicit.  The first couple minutes of ""Teenage 
    Dancefloor"" consists of nothing more than a bass drum thump and 
    dueling wah-wah guitars.  It's like Spacemen 3 getting funky on 
    Shakedown Street-- groovy music from where the KC don't shine.
    
    The four studio tracks are much more slick and composed. VHS or Beta 
    being an instrumental band, the reference point for these tracks is 
    not the Bee Gees, but the faceless instrumental tracks that also 
    graced the <em>Saturday Night Fever</em> soundtrack. Think David Shire, 
    not Donna Summer. These tracks are solid feel-good music, but only 
    the opening ""Heaven"" really leaps out of the speakers.  It opens with 
    a glossy update on the lead riff from <em>Shaft,</em> then glides into 
    a boogie wonderland of glistening crescendos, rock-solid beats, and 
    finally, a party chorus chanting something about getting down on a 
    Saturday night.</p><p>
    
    ""Heaven"" contains by far the most prominent vocal on <em>Le Funk</em> 
    and points to a possible direction for
    the next record. With a few proper songs and an attenuation of irony 
    VHS or Beta could eventually turn in something truly amazing.</p></div>"|8457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8457-le-funk/|6.8|Mark Richard-San

This new album of
    yours is in very bad shape.  I'm afraid it may not even make it
    through the next play.  I've been listening to it over and over again
    the way I always do when I've got a review to write, and it's driving
    me up the wall.</p><p>
    
    Now, I'm looking at the back of the case and noticing the insignia of
    the Hush label, whose ""anti-rock"" dogma is all too apparent on this
    release.  This album does not rock.  Oh, how it doesn't rock!  It's
    nearly impossible to count the ways this doesn't rock.  I mean, there
    are plenty of amazing albums out there that don't rock one bit, but
    all of them have some aspect that makes up for it-- you know,
    jaw-dropping melodies, lushness of sound, or just a generally
    pleasing vibe.</p><p>
    
    This self-titled Kind of Like Spitting release doesn't really have
    any of those things.  Rather, it's like listening to some kid with a
    high school composition book full of lyrics sitting in the corner of
    Au Bon Pain singing about all the crap that's ever happened to him
    during his painful tenure in suburbia.  He's barely strumming his
    guitar, and he makes you finish whatever it is you're eating just a
    little quicker so you can leave.</p><p>
    
    All of these songs are old-- they've just been extracted from the
    Kind of Like Spitting archives and re-recorded for this album, but who
    asked for 'em?  The disc opens with ""Crossover Potential,"" which may
    as well be the anthem of Hush Records, with its lyrics about not
    having any punk rock credentials or mainstream potential.  It also
    reveals the fatal trap of being anti-rock by being incredibly boring.
    Ever-so-sparse acoustic guitar strumming and vocals that betray a
    limited range are all you get.  ""Mine"" hardly sounds like a song at
    all, with its somnambulent finger-picking accompanied by equally
    sleepy vocals that still manage to sound strained.  What might be a
    toy piano shows up in the background near the end, but it doesn't
    really do anything except mimic the already negligible guitar part.
    And this goes on for more than five minutes.</p><p>
    
    I'd go on, but there's hardly much more to talk about.  Two songs
    manage to rise out of the mire slightly-- a cover of Braid's ""What a
    Wonderful Puddle"" and the guitar-and-flute instrumental ""Canoe,""
    which has a nice enough folk vibe to get by.  As for that Braid
    cover, the strumming is more spirited than usual and the melody is
    good, but even as a standout track it's lacking.   At least Braid
    kicked a little ass while they were emoting in your face.</p><p>
    
    Now, Mr. Barnett, you say in your liner notes that you've been
    playing with a rock band recently, and that you've been enjoying it.
    Good for you.  I say, stick with it and see how it works out.  It's
    got to have more going for it than this.  I'm sure there are people
    out there searching for an album like this-- quiet, sparse, and-- um,
    sorry, but I kind of ran out of neutral adjectives there.  Anyway,
    good luck in your future endeavors; it's high time you left this one
    behind you.</p></div>"|4433.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4433-kind-of-like-spitting/|2.7|Joe Tangari

Some would say it's wrong even to
    ask that question, while others might wonder if Baltimore's The
    Convocation Of..., on the strength of <em>Pyramid Technology</em>,
    doesn't give us too much of a good thing.  Like the religious zealots
    in Egypt who spent years in the desert to prove their devotion, The
    Convocation Of... has a solid dedication to heads-down,
    hair-in-your-face rock.</p><p>
<em>Pyramid Technology</em> sounds like it was recorded right in the
    Convocation's rehearsal space.  The band is a power trio with George
    France on drums, Guy Blakeslee on bass and some background keyboards,
    and Tonie Joy, formerly of Moss Icon, on vocals and guitar.  France
    is heavy but nimble: he sets up some plodding beats and then layers
    in intricate patterns behind Joy's textural guitars.  Joy has a raw
    tone, deep and raunchy, with a thick, craftsmanlike sound.  Even the
    seven-minute instrumental that ends the album avoids being ambling or
    pointless, and Joy resists the temptation to subject us to any
    obnoxiously flashy fretwork: they just dig in, Joy almost studiously
    building his anti-solo while Blakeslee's bass line thunders in the
    background, heavy and spare.</p><p>
    
    My only issue with <em>Pyramid Technology</em> is that all nine tracks
    sound very, very similar.  Each song delivers short, thudding,
    dirge-like rock with the same bleak atmosphere.  The band starts off
    angry, stays angry, and leaves angry, without any frills like an arc
    or a resolution.  ""Recognize"" and ""Walk Like a Panther"" break into
    (almost identical) interludes with gentler guitar and mesmerizing
    drumming - but those are the only interruptions, and guest singer
    Sheri Kadeché's low monotone just makes her two tracks seem grimmer.
    Joy's own vocals are serviceably emphatic-- the talk-shouting works
    for his subjects, standard hard rock fare concerning monsters, Satan,
    and The Man.</p><p>
    
    If you're not up for the rock-- or if your dedication to the rock
    falters-- the Convocation may seem stifling.  You may even be bored
    to tears.  You might start clawing at the disc, digging for some kind
    of sugarcoating-- a catchy hook, some cheesy keyboards, maybe some
    really comic lyrics-- you know, something like ""Iron Man.""  But
    that's not what the Convocation are about.  This is serious business,
    and they're not gonna let you forget it.</p></div>"|1596.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1596-pyramid-technology/|7.9|Chris Dahlen

    about Wolfgang Voigt's Kompakt label.  If Voigt had to set aside
    making music as Gas to get Kompakt off the ground, figuratively
    trading in his mixing console for a shiny Steelcase desk piled with
    telephones and staplers, at least he's done it right.  Kompakt is
    emerging as a model electronic label, showing the upstarts how it
    should be done: present a unified visual aesthetic, release an
    impressive variety of music that manages to retain identifying
    reference points, and offer a number of excellent compilations
    that develop and refine the overriding approach.</p><p>
    
    Last year's <em>Pop Ambient 2001</em> compilation was the first
    to showcase the ambient side of the Kompakt coin.  The fantastic
    collection offered two tracks by Germany's Markus Guentner, who
    has now released his debut album, <em>In Moll</em>, on the label.
    The initial buzz surrounding the record had Guentner picking up
    the torch of hyper-textural cloud music where Gas had left it
    with <em>Pop</em>.</p><p>
    
    And it's true: Guentner's approach has similarities to <em>Pop</em>,
    especially on <em>In Moll</em>'s first half.  Keyboards focus on
    spiraling patterns of repeating melody, precisely mixed clusters of
    noise highlight the music's tactile qualities, the 4/4 thump pokes
    in its well-manicured head on a track or two. Mind you, I'm not
    complaining about the similarities-- Guentner does Gas-eous ambient
    extremely well.</p><p>
    
    But there's much more to Guentner than mimicry. While the timbral
    quality of the music sure feels familiar, the overall tone of <em>In
    Moll</em> is unsettling.  Rather than conjuring images of vast open
    space, Guentner seems to bounce around inside a concrete box. There
    is, for example, a distinct claustrophobic edge to the second track
    (the pieces are not titled). For all the squishy sonic seasoning it
    contains, the piece sounds like a recording of the boiler room that
    powers some bleak animated world.  The wheezes and throbs of the
    machine seem to echo in some tight, dank space: industry triumphs
    over nature.</p><p>
    
    The fourth track begins with two spare chords that suggest a peaceful
    ""calm after the storm"" kind of atmosphere, then takes a left turn as
    the pastoral chords are overwhelmed with a swell of prickly static.
    The fifth track is the glitchiest of the bunch, as several distinct
    and individually compelling swatches of music are stitched together
    into complex overlapping patterns.  Track six adds a synthetic
    orchestral grandeur that reminds me a little of... well, Vangelis,
    really-- there's something epic and dignified about 'strings'
    that aren't even trying to sound real. Even <em>In Moll</em>'s
    closing piece, a patient exercise in drone and assorted
    electronic percussion, manages to stay engaging for its sixteen
    minutes.</p><p>
    
    Guentner's debut album is an impressive work of atmospheric
    electronica, and <em>In Moll</em> threads another feather into
    Kompakt's cap.</p></div>"|3585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3585-in-moll/|8.3|Mark Richardson

    about the dissolution of a ""hyper-modern marriage,"" but Pedro the
    Lion's David Bazan has a difficult time sticking to the subject on
    this, his third full-length.  Aside from a few cynical words for
    pre-nups in opener ""Options"" and not one, but <i>three</i>
    meditations on extramarital sex (thanks for sharing, Dave),
    the album is padded with typical Pedro ruminations on the
    pitfalls of vanity and technology.</p><p>
    
    Unlike our esteemed colleague DiCrescenzo, I enjoyed <em>Winners
    Never Quit</em>, with its thoughtful and highly personal themes
    of loss, regret, and competition.  But where that album moved
    with confidence and conviction of purpose, <em>Control</em>
    wallows in an amoral netherworld of overamped midtempo ballads
    and incomplete thoughts.</p><p>
<i>Control</i>'s lack of focus is best exemplified by ""Indian
    Summer,"" a synthy rocker peppered with rhyming non-sequiturs
    such as, ""The experts say you ought to start them young/ That
    way they'll naturally love the taste of corporate cum.""  A
    sluggish, vocoder-treated new recording of ""April 6, 2039""
    (now titled ""Progress"") does little but detract from the spacey,
    drum-machine propelled futurism of the original.  With its
    refrain of ""your father drank a little, you're on liver number
    two,"" Bazan's cautionary words of children spoiled by technology
    and their parents' emotional detachment should be <em>Control</em>'s
    moral centerpiece, yet the lackluster reading here barely
    registers.</p><p>
    
    Instead, Bazan obsesses on the seedy details of his protagonists'
    motel-room infidelities. ""The mattress creaks beneath the symphony of
    misery and cum,"" Bazan sings on the aggressive, voyeuristic ""Second
    Best.""  ""Still we lie jerking back and forth, and blurring into one.""
    But <em>Control</em> is never more misguided than on the silly,
    Metaphor 101 observations of ""Rapture,"" which cheaply likens the
    moment of orgasm to divine revelation and even slows the pace of
    the song down, post-coitally, before pepping back up again.</p><p>
    
    Musically, <em>Control</em> breaks little new ground for Pedro the
    Lion, though Bazan's drumming has improved greatly since <em>Winners
    Never Quit</em>, best showcased in the loping rhythms and artfully
    executed fills of ""Magazine.""  Unfortunately, Bazan goes on to
    illustrate why you should never let a drummer mix his own record on
    the next cut, ""Rehearsal,"" with some of the hammiest fills since
    <em>Wayne's World</em>'s Garth drummed for U2 and a headache-inducing
    barrage of overdriven cymbals.  Somebody send Bazan a copy of
    <em>The Soft Bulletin</em>, pronto!</p><p>
    
    Not that <em>Control</em> doesn't have its moments:  ""Penetration,""
    co-written with Seldom's Casey Foubert, is a reasonably cathartic
    requiem for a dotcom layoff, with chiming, Edge-like guitars and a
    brash, anthemic chorus.  Lines like, ""We're so sorry, sir, but you did
    not quite make the cut this time,"" will ring sympathetically
    with anyone who's ever been passed over as casually as a
    grade-school snot picking teams for dodgeball.  ""Priests and
    Paramedics,"" rising majestically from the overkill of ""Second
    Best,"" is elevated by a lovely, Thom Yorke-ish melody custom
    made for Bazan's stoned tenor.  It's not hard to imagine its
    tired protagonist stepping out of Martin Scorsese's <em>Bringing
    Out the Dead</em> and onto the murder scene of <em>Winners</em>'s
    ""Never Leave a Job Half Done.""  The song's evocative imagery
    and fetching arrangement deserve a better concept album than
    the jumbled pastiche of <em>Control</em>.</p><p>
    
    Even Bazan's occasionally astute observations are offset by such
    poetry-contest entries as, ""It will never rain again/ It should
    do wonders for the GNP,"" and, ""How does that work for you in
    your quest to be above reproach?""  Or the half-baked philosophy
    of the dead-on-arrival album closer, ""Rejoice"": ""Wouldn't it be
    so wonderful if everything were meaningless?""  Oh, honestly,
    Dave.</p><p>
    
    It would be easy to dismiss <em>Control</em> as a pompous,
    self-important failure were Bazan a vain and sanctimonious
    artist. But he's not-- he seems like a soft-spoken, thoughtful,
    nice-enough guy just like you and me.  And while he may never
    make his own <em>OK Computer</em> or <em>Soft Bulletin</em> or
    whatever he set out to make with <em>Control</em>, I won't dock
    him points for trying.</p></div>"|6215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6215-control/|7.2|Will Bryant

    big record labels, <em>making</em> records equals <em>selling</em>
    records. There are few moral or artistic victories in the record
    industry-- just dreams of platinum hardware and signing the next
    J-Lo.  Or would that be J-Lo's hardware and the next platinum record?
    Hmm...</p><p>
    
    Back to business, though, and our case study: J-Live, a formidable MC
    and producer, and one of brightest talents in hip-hop's underground
    today.  After drawing the attention of the suits in the mid-90s with
    fierce underground singles like ""Braggin' Writes"" and ""Hush the
    Crowd,"" J-Live inked a record deal and began to cut his first LP.
    But owing to myriad artistic and contract squabbles, J won himself a
    taste of the big shaft.  Not a single official copy of the LP saw the
    light of day until late 2001, nearly five years after the process
    began. I blame the record labels, defilers of vinyl, bandwidth, and
    all other things aurally sacred. <em>The Best Part</em> would certainly
    be close to the top of any hip-hop top ten list in any year, even a
    strong one like 2001.</p><p>
    
    That's over now, though, and J-Live has come to a peace about his
    former predicament (""I've dealt with being dealt dirty,  downsized
    and duped/Done double-paid my dues, for real""). Given the delay,
    though, you can't blame the guy for making up for lost time. A meager
    six months after finally dropping <em>The Best Part</em>, J-Live has
    blessed us again with his sophomore LP, <em>All of the Above</em>,
    though on the ever-so-underground Coup D'Etat label.</p><p>
    
    And no surprise-- this shit is tight.  J-Live describes his lyrical
    style as ""true school.""  Now, I'm a lily white white-boy, and I'll
    admit I have no idea that means.  Whatever he was getting at, though,
    it's clear that this former English teacher (J-Live taught seventh
    grade in Brooklyn) has a serious Native Tongues influence. His
    delivery is similar to Posdnuos, and his lyrical content is along the
    same lines: intelligent, educated, confident, and socially conscious.
    And, like De La, J can bring it. His lyrics are clever, and he does
    shit with meter and rhyming patterns that is simply mind-blowing. </p><p>
    
    In terms of beats, J-Live's knows when to pass the mic, or rather,
    pass the console. One of his best moves was to enlist the
    assistance of virtuoso producer DJ Spinna. Spinna dishes dimes on a
    third of the album's 21 tracks, including two of the strongest,
    ""Satisfied?"" and ""All of the Above.""   ""Satisfied?,"" the first single
    off the disc, uses reggae-flavored bass and keys in the verses, then
    adds lo-fi accordion in the chorus, in addition to what sounds like a
    boys choir.  Upon closer inspection (and a peek at the liner notes)
    it's actually grown men (J-Live et al) singing ""are you satisfied?""
    in falsetto-- a neat trick.</p><p>
    
    ""All of the Above"" is easily the best track, musically, on the album.
    The beat has a chilled-out, transcendent quality to it, spinning a
    low-key jazz funk in the bass along with ethereal keys (courtesy of
    Ticklah) and shifty scratches in the instrumental chorus (courtesy of
    DP One). The rhyme is a fucking masterpiece, delivered via
    double-tracked vocals-- one more or less the ""melody"" track, with a
    ""harmony"" track lurking underneath. Sound rich?  It is.</p><p>
    
    As if five years of trying to get his debut out weren't proof enough,
    <em>All of the Above</em> makes it clear that J-Live is no flash in the
    pan.  Rather, it gives you the feeling that J is just at the dawn of
    a fairly epic career. Good things come to those who wait-- and
    hopefully, somewhere, a record exec is kicking himself over this
    one.</p></div>"|4179.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4179-all-of-the-above/|8.5|Brad Haywood

    birth of something vital.  Eastern Connecticut doesn't exactly have
    what you'd call an amazing music scene, but there we were, several
    dozen people mashed into a rented room at the Willimantic Elks Club,
    focusing our attention on the pile of gear crammed in the corner and
    the musicians strewn among it, trying their best to deal with a
    cantankerous sound system.  About ten bands played at the event that
    day-- the organizers called it Inertia-- and truth be told, most of
    them weren't that memorable.</p><p>
    
    You had a half dozen of those sloppy metal bands with one technically
    competent member that seem to spring like weeds from the high schools
    of Connecticut, and some sort of electronic set that was so nebulous
    no one could even tell when it had begun.  As far as I can remember--
    and this was all years ago, you realize-- there were two bands really
    worth seeing that day-- the charmingly cynical folk duo Adam's Leaf,
    and the headliners, a four-headed monstrosity called Zealous Fuel.</p><p>
    
    The Fuel came on as the sun was going down outside, and left behind a
    trail of splattered brains and warped minds-- more than a few audience
    members were left mentally paralyzed by the band's brand of
    particularly outre weird rock. I can't remember exactly how much time
    has passed between that show and the present, but listening to
    Zealous Fuel's first actual album (they released two cassettes that
    they distributed themselves in the late 90s), I can tell you that
    they're no less bizarre than they were back when I first saw them.</p><p>
    
    Let's say this: tons of people will totally hate this music.  At
    times, it seems like that might even be the point.  Drummer Thatcher
    Graham's self-taught grooves aren't the least bit conventional and
    his fills are sometimes downright childish, but the way the band
    locks into his naïve rhythms is remarkably effective.
    Bassist/vocalist Mike Kelly probably has the strongest chops in the
    band, dishing out funky, freaky bass lines while the dual guitars of
    Jason Beebe and Tanner Johnson careen around him with precision or
    drunken abandon, as needed.</p><p>
    
    And then there's the little matter of Kelly's vocals.  Delivered
    alternately in a vaguely tuneful sneer and a low, rumbling growl,
    they don't really conjure much you'll have heard before.  Taker
    together with the band's turn-on-a-dime grooves and strangely
    juxtaposed instrumental parts, they have an almost Beefheartiar
    effect, though Kelly never gets quite as affected as Don Van Vliet at
    his strangest.  Graham is the band's main lyricist, and the boy has
    an odd head on his shoulders to be sure.</p><p>
<em>The Unknown Label</em> opens with ""Sticks To Your Ribs,"" blasting
    in with a thick drum and bass groove motoring away under Beebe and
    Johnson, whose guitar has just about the ugliest tone you could
    imagine.  The music sways wildly back and forth between this, the
    teetering, almost martial stuttering of the verses, and the strangely
    melodic chorus.  The effect is pleasantly disorienting, leaving the
    listener appropriately off guard for the rest of the album.</p><p>
    
    The band's crunchy signature song, ""Zealous Fuel,"" clamors along like
    some sort of demo Killing Joke might have recorded after their fifth
    or sixth rehearsal.  Kelly's sterling bass line on ""Failure"" is

    clear though.  For my part, just hearing something so willfully
    different and strange is enough to make me breathe easy for the

Most of my waking hours are filled
    with it. Hell, a lot of the time I spend in deep sleep is apparently
    filled with it too. I can't tell you how many times I've woken up
    with some song endlessly looping in my brain that has absolutely no
    business being there-- Rockwell's ""Somebody's Watching Me,"" for
    instance, or the theme song to <em>Blossom.</em>  Alas, there is a
    boring sameness to a lot of music, especially rock and pop, but
    sometimes you feel completely jaded, like nothing could surprise you,
    like if the equivalent of the Beatles or Faust came out today, you'd
    be unable or unwilling to realize it.  I know I needed some quiet
    time away from music to refresh my ears when I find myself thinking,
    ""Hey, that Slayer song kind of sounds like Gloria Gaynor.""</p><p>
    
    So what does this have to do with Skiptrace?  Well, if you think
    I'm gonna say this EP is refreshing, that it's some kind of shrill clarion
    call to wake us overloaded music snobs from our deep slumber, you're
    wrong.   You obviously missed the above rating, or you need to
    reacquaint yourself with the key to your right.  This six-song EP's
    only real accomplishment is how completely forgettable it is.</p><p>
    
    It doesn't matter how much interchangeable music has been
    soundtracking my days lately, this sucker takes the cake for utter
    intangibility.  I listened to this EP quite a few times through, but
    it's impossible to say how many exactly. I put it on repeat, and by
    the time it's played six or seven times through, nothing-- not one
    single lyric or melody-- has attached itself to me.  It's like a
    collection of songs made out of massless neutrino particles from the
    sun, passing through me without a trace.</p><p>
    
    Semisonic's moronic, once-inescapable ""Closing Time"" comes to mind
    when Skiptrace singer Scott Sellwood steps up to the mic, and the
    band has obviously paid some attention when listening to Big Star,
    Todd Rundgren, Matthew Sweet and Jellyfish.  Not that I'd call them a
    pure power pop band exactly-- they have a little indie rock crud on
    them, tarnishing the gleam.  But it's not enough to give them much of
    a distinctive sound.</p><p>
    
    Two of the songs were produced by Bill Janovitz from Buffalo Tom. The
    band apparently sent him a demo and he liked it so much he asked them
    out to Fort Apache in Cambridge, MA to record.  It's hard to imagine
    what it was that attracted him to this particular band out of the
    faceless throng. Maybe he had his eyes on his pocketbook (aren't
    Buffalo Tom doing a B-sides retrospective or somesuch?) because these
    songs seem custom-made for use in some subliminal ad campaign.  Maybe
    when that happens I'll wake up with, say, this EP's ""Open Hands""
    stuck in my head. Until then, it's difficult to remember much about
    it when I'm awake.</p></div>"|7225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7225-skiptrace-ep/|2.3|Jason Nickey

    good people?""  I've asked, consulted holy writings, quibbled
    semantics with philosophers-- but I've never received a satisfactory
    answer.  But now, I think I've got the solution, thanks to Earl
    Zinger's album <em>Put Your Phazers On Stun.</em> Bad things don't
    happen to good people-- good people just make bad choices.</p><p>
    
    Actually, Earl Zinger does not exist. He's as much a cartoon as 2-D,
    Murdoch, and the other Gorillaz. The sorry-ass Wizard of Oz behind
    the Earl Zinger curtain is unfortunately  jazz-funker Rob Gallagher.
    Gallagher was a founder member of hempy jazz-poetry fusioneers,
    Galliano, and lately the mastermind behind the ace Two Banks of Four
    project.</p><p>
    
    I first encountered Two Banks of Four on some nu-jazz compilation or
    other and the track ""Skylines Over Rooftops"" shone out luminously
    from the rest of the ooh-that's-jazz! diminished chord mush. With a
    fragile, fractured drum pattern coupled with a voice suggesting Sam
    Cooke covering the Blue Nile's ""The Downtown Lights,"" I was
    immediately smitten with Two Banks of Four. Amassing all Two Banks of
    Four material didn't take long -- there's just the <em>City
    Watching</em> album and an accompanying remix CD.</p><p>
    
    I'd expected Gallagher to turn out another late-night masterpiece--
    eerie, brooding, yet comforting. Alas, no.  <em>Put Your Phazers On
    Stun</em> is meant to satirize dance music, especially the jazz-funk
    style that Ladbroke Grove hipsters adore.  Gallagher's turned out a
    comedy-poetry album-- Earl Zinger is Wendy Cope or Pam Ayers for
    slap-happy jazzbos.  The songs are essentially suckerpunches at
    pretentious twats who have to get the latest Bugz in the Attic before
    anyone else (""Saturday Morning Rush""). On ""Escape to Ibiza,"" Zinger
    mocks salmon-pink Brits who swarm the blissful island of Ibiza, but
    with none of the gleeful spite that Blur used for ""Girls and Boys.""
    Sorry, you'll get more yucks for your bucks if you slap Jamiroquai
    into the stereo and fall out over Jason Kay's gigantic
    self-delusion.</p><p>
<em>Set Your Phazers On Stun</em> fails in comparison to albums such as
    John Cooper Clarke's <em>Me and My Big Mouth</em>, because Gallagher's
    impotent rim-shot rhymes are no match for Clarke's cruel Manchester
    wit.  The tiresome production on <em>Put Your Phazers On Stun</em> is
    not even on the same landmass as the futuristic art-punk that Martin
    Hannant fashioned for Clarke.</p><p>
    
    Dance music needs acts like V/VM, Moodyman, and Kid 606 to rip into
    its bloated stomach and let the world inhale the fetid stench of its
    mega-bucks complacence.  <em>Put Your Phazers On Stun</em> is not part
    of the revolution-- rather, it's complicit in dance music's demise by
    the slightness of its scenester references and self-important
    in-jokes.</p></div>"|8936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8936-put-your-phazers-on-stun-throw-your-health-food-skyward/|4.2|Paul Cooper

A mere seven or eight years ago, Gerard
    Cosloy and Chris Lombardi's New York label was the undisputed king of
    the alternative rock world, sporting a roster full of
    just-off-the-mainstream-radar luminaries like
    Pavement, Liz Phair, and Guided by Voices.  But since then, Matador's
    thoroughbreds have all weakened, be it from a) recording silence after
    marriage/childbirth/divorce, b) loss of uniqueness from courting radio,
    or c) splintering into less compelling solo entities.  Were it not for
    lucrative back catalog sales and a pack of Scottish nancy-boys, Matador
    would surely be frolicking in record label heaven with IRS and Twin/Tone.</p><p>
    
    Jon Spencer and his Blues Explosion weren't quite in the upper
    echelon of the above artists, but they were sufficiently high profile
    to appear in <em>Rolling Stone</em> and on <em>120 Minutes</em> back in
    those headier mid-nineties.  At their peak, JSBX straddled the line
    between novelty act and early-rock throwback by whitening up the
    blues behind Spencer's 'Elvis with Tourette's Syndrome' vocals.  It
    was an entertaining gimmick, albeit one with a short shelf life, and it
    was already starting to fizzle by the time of 1995's <em>Now I Got
    Worry</em>.  Perhaps recognizing this, the band experimented with Dan
    the Automator and Alec Empire for the <em>Acme</em> and <em>Xtra-Acme</em>
    albums, to uniformly bland results.</p><p>
    
    In response to those failures, Spencer &amp; Co. have returned to the
    basics for <em>Plastic Fang</em>: two guitars, a bag full of riffs, and
    frequent interjections of ""Blues Explosion!""  Never mind the tiny
    fact that the band's gimmick, if tired in the mid-nineties, is
    downright comatose these days.  Nobody seems to have informed JSBX
    that the world's music warehouse has become overstocked on pale-faced
    blues, with the White Stripes, etc. improving the sound by keeping
    things quick and raw while dispensing with the ironic wink.</p><p>
    
    Or perhaps the Blues Explosion is aware of the garage revival, and
    looking to claim some kind of Neil Young-esque patriarchal crown.  If
    so, the dozen tracks of <em>Plastic Fang</em> fail miserably, giving
    off the appearance of a 35 year-old accountant hanging around the old
    frat house on Homecoming weekend.  From the limp rockabilly of first
    single ""She Said"" to the faux-live party-stomper ""Hold On,""
    the Blues Explosion never venture outside of territory they haven't
    already beaten to death, producing hollow echoes of their stronger
    early days.</p><p>
    
    Don't fault Russell Simins, whose Grade-A drumming on ""Money Rock N'
    Roll"" and ""The Midnight Creep"" is comparable to putting a Corvette
    engine in a Ford Focus.  No, blame should be firmly thrown towards
    bandleader Spencer, whose drawling soul man act has shifted from
    tongue-in-cheek egotism to outright cartoon.  Punctuating verses with
    yells of ""Blues Explosion!"" and ""Rock and roll!"" might have amused me
    when I was 15, but in an age where Jay-Z self-promotes seventeen
    different aliases over the course of an album, Spencer sounds just
    plain out-of-touch.  Given that <em>Plastic Fang</em> lyrically seems
    to be a loose concept album casting Spencer as a werewolf... well,
    that really doesn't even require further comment.</p><p>
    
    The dual guitar interplay of Spencer and Judah Bauer remains spottily
    potent, as on ""Over and Over,"" but usually loses its charm by the
    one-minute point of the song.  Had JSBX kept things short and poorly
    recorded, a stronger case could probably have been made for salvaging
    this project.  But tracks tend to stretch out over four lifelessly
    produced minutes so that Spencer can make tired Frampton and James
    Brown references, coasting along with a fraction of the energetic
    kick they used to have.  It's ironic, and a little bit sad, to see a
    band whose original goal was to steer the music world back towards
    Marquee Club-era Stones grow as stodgy and irrelevant as <em>Steel
    Wheels</em>-era Stones.</p><p>
    
    So while JSBX hasn't formally announced <em>Plastic Fang</em> as their
    farewell album, this writer's going to go ahead and pronounce them
    officially deceased (hopefully tricking them into retiring).  In true
    series finale style, it's time to fire up Green Day's ""Time of Your
    Life"" and run the slo-mo highlight reel: the brilliant Aerosmith/Run
    DMC sendup video for ""Flavor,"" that other video where John C. Reilly
    played Simins, the collaborations with R.L. Burnside and Rufus
    Thomas, and what the hell, Spencer's wife Cristina Martinez running
    around in a bra and miniskirt.  Farewell, Blues Explosion... we knew
    ye too well.</p></div>"|4292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4292-plastic-fang/|2.5|Rob Mitchum

    and frustration"" that comes from being stuck in the middle of
    nowhere, working alone for long stretches of time, discouraged from
    associating with others. Apparently, prior to making music, Matt
    Haines-- The Rip-Off Artist-- worked for an offshore drilling
    operation. Or so the notes claim. But then,  the liner notes on
    Haines' previous albums would have you believe him to be an android,
    an inventor of MIDI-banjos, and a collective of satirists during the
    Nixon administration... you get the idea. Bust out the grains of
    salt. Still, when Haines talks about isolation, about ""working for
    weeks at a time in twelve-hour shifts, surrounded by the constant din
    of sea and machine"", I do believe that he speaks from experience.
    After all, this is a man who makes music with a computer, and as
    Haines himself puts it, ""Pop music is hard work.""</p><p>
    
    Listening to <em>Pump</em>, that much is obvious. Anything that changes
    direction this often must've been hard work. Though I do wonder about
    the lazy application of the word ""pop.""  The thirteen songs here
    (which are, for no apparent reason, split into 69 tracks) traverse a
    wide range of styles and an even wider array of sounds and genres.
    Truth be told, I don't know what to call <em>Pump.</em>  It's
    electronic to be certain-- there isn't a single organic sound to be
    found here-- but outside of that broad disclaimer, it's hard to peg.
    <em>Pump</em>'s roots are clearly in house music: more often than not
    there's a clearly discernable 4/4 beat, marked by repeated drum
    patterns and sounds which creep in then back out a few times over the
    course of a song; minute details that appear, then disappear, one by
    one.  Meanwhile, Haines cycles through a seemingly endless catalog of
    goofy electronic noises which suggest everything from 60's library
    music to old-school Warp Records to kids' toy samplers.</p><p>
    
    ""Swage Nipple"" (supposedly, named after a piece of machinery used in
    the off-shore oil drilling industry) begins by matching a basic house
    formula (4/4 drum machines, four tones which switch between ascending
    and descending with each bar) with a crunchy, distorted rhythmic
    track.  But before the listener can really put his finger on
    anything, the elements fall away one by one, leaving behind skeletons
    which drift around in the leftover sonic residue.  The next few
    minutes are purely ambient, contrasting the eminently danceable
    opening tracks. There's some traditional keyboard noodling, a few
    bleeps and bloops, the sound of synthesized wind in the background.</p><p>
    
    And then the a few of the random blips begin to accumulate, to lump
    together, to form the beat that kicks off ""Ball and Swing.""  A
    head-nodding, glitch-laden click-hop song that would've fit just
    right on last year's <em>Electric Ladyland</em> comp, ""Ball and Swing""
    practically cries out for some twisted MC's input, before giving up
    the search and heading in yet another direction.  Haines revisits
    this idea later in a song called ""Eye of the Impeller,"" which opens
    with a loop of garbled rhymes, only to get pelted by a rainstorm of
    MIDI-samples and clicky percussion.</p><p>
    
    You've probably heard most of the sounds here before. Haines has a
    propensity toward goofy Perrey-Kingsley style stuff-- pure
    electronics.  As such, you'll find no garbled field recordings or
    electro-acoustic dallying here-- this is all right from Haines' hard
    drive. And yet, despite recent trends toward the inclusion of
    acoustic instruments in beat-driven stuff, <em>Pump</em> is by no means
    a step back. Unlike so many artists working with a mouse and monitor
    today, Haines' music is identifiably his own.  The Rip-Off Artist has
    a decidedly unique take on traditional electronic music, one that is
    danceable, yet equally engaging to the mind. It's the sort of thing
    that'll play just as well on the dance floor as it will in any of
    those distant, isolated places where all these weird sounds come from
    in the first place.</p></div>"|6792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6792-pump/|7.0|David M. Pecoraro

    potentially Daedalian, task for the A-list 90s songwriters that contribute to
    her latest album, <i>Kissin Time</i>.  Though Billy Corgan and Dave Stewart
    whisk thin, sun-damaged musical vehicles of feather and wax, Beck, Blur, and
    Pulp contribute magnificent and complex structures for Faithfull to slither
    through. The results as a whole, whether fabulously disastrous or formidable,
    offer an aural spectacle that other 55-year-old, or even 35-year-old, rock
    stars should dream of wrangling.</p><p>
    
    Faithfull-- the nearest thing rock and roll has to a forgotten Olympian--
    comfortably confronts sex in all of her work.  When Jarvis Cocker duets or
    ""Sliding Through Life on Charm,"" he immediately seems like an ideal partner
    for tackling mature sexuality, nailing Faithfull's essence to a sleazy bed
    of <i>Different Class</i> e-bow wailing.  Between cigarette drags, Faithfull
    sings, ""Suburban shits who want some class/ All queue up to kiss my ass,""
    directing the statement at all those who want to ""kiss [her] snatch.""   Yet
    in an age when Marianne's old flame, Mick Jagger, offers meaningless, coy tripe
    like, ""Oh joy/ The love you bring/You make me sing,"" and, ""Don't let me near
    the garden of earthly delights/ Because I could get used to your vision of
    paradise,"" it's refreshing to hear a Centrum Silver-popping singer talk plainly
    about fucking.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, Beck-- an artist who toys with sexuality behind the shield of irony,
    whether that's humping appliances in his videos or bitch-talkin' booty rap or
    <i>Midnite Vultures</i>-- finds a chanteuse in Faithfull, who infuses a newfound
    poignancy in his lyrics.  ""Like Being Born,"" a tale of a girl coming of age, is
    rife with latent, creepy tones of incest, and floats on a delicate chamber
    melody bettering most anything on his masterwork <i>Mutations</i>.  A maudlir
    reading of that album's ""Nobody's Fault But My Own"" also appears here, the
    lines, ""Who could ever be so cruel/ Blame the devil for the things you do/ Tell
    me that it's nobody's fault but my own,"" hitting the country-tragedy mark with
    greater aim in a woman's voice.  ""Sex With Strangers"" is typically cheeky Beck
    fare, and enraptures with sick beats, falling somewhere between <i>Amnesiac</i>
    and Prince's <i>Controversy</i>.</p><p>
    
    Billy Corgan, on the other hand, crafts asexual rock as a rule. Cresting or
    <i>Adore</i> and <i>Machina</i>, his sexless sound tucks and covers any visceral
    interaction with its audience through watery washes of Flood production and
    coldly androgynous leather stage outfits.  Faithfull deserves better thar
    Corgan's overproduced music for confused teenagers.  His lyrics, laden with the
    words ""something,"" ""whatever,"" ""pain,"" ""happiness,"" and ""wherever,"" reverberate
    vaguely in a throat that's been around the block too many times to know better.
    In his continuing quest to make his keyboards and guitars sound completely
    indistinguishable from one another, Corgan embarrasses himself among his peers.
    Jarvis Cocker induces Faithfull to curse and brag; Corgan closes the album with
    a Herman's Hermits cover.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Faithfull wanders into predictable, passable glitchy electronica.
    ""The Pleasure Song"" stutters and crackles like Depeche Mode hoped they might,
    and even squeezes some neat fading tricks in surround stereo.  Firsthand
    experience excuses Faithfull's amusingly silly lyrics and Dave Stewart's smooth
    synth-pop on ""Song for Nico"" (not short for ""Nicotine""), even if Stewart's stab
    at AAA Suede smells fresher than Corgan's contributions.</p><p>
    
    But Blur's title track towers over the fouls.  Damon Albarn hypnotizes with a
    loop of acoustic guitar over percussion clearly influenced by his recent
    endeavors in Mali.  Graham Coxon injects sharp sounds of gris-gris pinball from
    his guitar.  An organ, distant feedback, and chanting harmonies take recent Blur
    directions like ""Tender"" and ""Black Book"" into eerier, better-realized territory.
    And as with his work for Clinic and Elbow, Ben Hillier's rich, organic productior
    continues to wow.</p><p>
<i>Kissin Time</i> stands as Faithfull's best work since 1979's <i>Broker
    English</i>, and achieves such a feat without taking clichéd ""mature"" detours
    into pop standards or orchestral arrangements.  Here's hope that the model
    carries over to people like Jagger and McCartney.  Aging rock stars take note:
    succumb to humbleness and work with others.  Singers like Faithfull and Nico
    always utilized the songs of others to great effect.  Icons of questionable
    songwriting talent but vivid personality can make some very entertaining
    records.  Picture Stephen Merritt behind Courtney Love!  Smog's Bill Callahar
    behind Iggy Pop!  Or Neko Case behind David Bowie!  At the very least, for the
    love of god, let Rob Thomas nowhere near the process.</p></div>"|2961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2961-kissin-time/|7.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

    think they're pretty damn radical.  From their press photos, one could gather
    that these boys have raided Lou Reed's attic (or at the very least, made off
    with some of the Strokes' luggage).  Complete with tight leather, black jeans,
    and dark shades, these kids are ready for fame.  In just about every picture,
    you've got a guy doing the rock splits, kicking out the attitude and the
    sexed-up pouts.  With more poses than Zoolander, they'd best be able to back it
    up with some decent rock.</p><p>
    
    Well, for the record, they do.  Last year's <em>People Get Ready</em> was an
    amazing debut from the leather-clad lads, and proved to be a wonderful fusion
    of punk ethos and a dirty garage-rock dance party. You could throw on the LP
    just about any time of day and party along to the Mooney Suzuki's simple guitar
    hooks, a thundering bass, and tight disco drumming.  With <em>Electric Sweat</em>,
    the band brings more of that goodness to the table-- and this time with more
    style than a Barbizon School for Modeling.</p><p>
<em>Electric Sweat</em> was recorded in Detroit, the birthplace of dirty rock 'n'
    roll.  Jim Diamond (of soul-punk outfit the Dirtbombs) has brought a gritty
    recording aesthetic to the group.  <em>Electric Sweat</em> was created at Ghetto
    Recorders, where the White Stripes, Jon Spencer, and the Come Ons have cut
    tracks recently.  And the Mooney Suzuki have certainly soaked up the atmosphere
    of Motor City.  <em>Electric Sweat</em> is an infectious collection of grooves
    that proudly utilizes the traditional vocabulary of rock 'n' roll and R&amp;B; to
    maximum effect.</p><p>
    
    The title track opens the record up with a guitar line courtesy of Graham
    Tyler's axe (rumor has it his guitar was fashioned out of a piece of wood from
    the bar top of the Old Absinthe House in New Orleans) that could be straight
    off <em>Exile on Main Street</em>, setting the pace for the rest of the record,
    lyrically and musically.  ""Get ready/ Get set/ What you get is electric sweat,""
    completely sums up the energy and the simplicity of this album.  Or the intro
    to ""Oh Sweet Susana""-- a bluesy, acoustic guitar rant that leads into a laid-back
    southern rock groove that would make Muddy Waters grin from ear to ear.  The
    swagger factor reaches its peak at ""Natural Fact,"" with its foot stompin' chorus
    and lines like: ""Mother Nature leave me be/ Desire off my back/ All this feeling
    killing me/ I need you girl before I crack.""</p><p>
    
    It's exciting to hear the influences of such monumental groups as the Who and
    the Yardbirds being waved all over the record with such youthful exuberance.
    Overall, there isn't much to complain about, even when it all sounds vaguely
    familiar.  Like the Strokes and the White Stripes, the Mooney Suzuki pulls from
    all the right influences to make a very cool, danceable sound infused with
    enthusiasm and energy.</p></div>"|5418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5418-electric-sweat/|7.5|Brock Kappers

    up, it's not immediately clear why they were such a big deal at the time, and
    why their myth continues to occupy the center of the alternative country
    universe.  Well, a lot of it has to do with the two bands that emerged from
    Uncle Tupelo's wreckage: Son Volt and Wilco.  Both bands have displayed moments
    of near-brilliance: every twist and turn along their career path adds to the
    myth of their former band.  Witness Son Volt's incredible debut, <em>Trace</em>,
    and their equally incredible decline into mumbling irrelevance, or Wilco's
    wobbly first steps before the masterful <em>Being There</em>, and their subsequent
    reinvention with <em>Summerteeth</em> and <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em>.  Both of
    these storylines figure heavily into how Uncle Tupelo is remembered.</p><p>
    
    So what makes Uncle Tupelo so special?  On a conceptual level, what
    they were doing wasn't completely without precedent. Three kids from
    southern Illinois, inspired by old-time country and punk, form a band
    sounding something like Dinosaur Jr. covering the Carter Family.
    Their precursors and contemporaries-- Rank and File, Souled American,
    Jason and the Scorchers, the Jayhawks, the Replacements, the Mekons--
    were all bands that combined country and, if not punk, then at least
    a certain DIY, anti-establishment aesthetic.  What set Uncle Tupelo
    apart, and why did this band have, and continue to have, such
    resonance among listeners?</p><p>
    
    Quite simply, Uncle Tupelo was the right band at the right time.
    Alternative music in general was gaining popularity by the time Uncle
    Tupelo released their first LP in 1990.  That album's title, <em>No
    Depression</em>, would itself become a synonym for alt.country.  As
    listeners revolted against what they saw as the mainstream, and the
    spirit of punk itself began to saturate popular music, many listeners
    craved a more authentic sound. And some found it in the music of
    Uncle Tupelo.</p><p>
    
    So, almost exactly a decade after Uncle Tupelo recorded their third
    and best album (<em>March 16-20, 1992</em>), along comes this 21-song
    retrospective, <em>89/93: An Anthology.</em>  This collection is meant
    to be an appetizer, something to get old and new fans alike
    interested in the proper albums, three of which will be reissued
    later this year (all but Uncle Tupelo's final album, Anodyne, have
    been out of print for quite some time).  As such, <em>Anthology</em> is
    a bit haphazard and not much of a cohesive listening experience.
    <em>Anthology</em>'s goals seem split between pleasing diehards with a
    few rarities (a demo, an unreleased B-side, a live cut, a radio
    session track) and seeking new converts by means of a good band
    overview.</p><p>
    
    Uncle Tupelo's best moments are Jay Farrar's. It was unquestionably
    his band, and he was hitting his songwriting peak just as they were
    breaking up.  His ""Graveyard Shift"" (from <em>No Depression</em>)
    evokes the vast expanse of possibility inherent in the combination of
    country and punk traditions. Songs like ""Whiskey Bottle"" and ""Still
    Be Around"" should, by all rights, sit alongside Creedence Clearwater
    Revival's best work in the future canon of classic rock.  And
    speaking of Creedence, Anthology rescues from oblivion Tupelo's
    sinister cover of ""Effigy"" (it originally appeared on 1993's <em>No
    Alternative</em> comp).  Tracks like these have an undeniable
    exuberance and bear the mark of a great band.</p><p>
    
    But <em>Anthology</em> tries to even the score by giving equal time to
    both of Tupelo's songwriters, and Jeff Tweedy's early material falls
    a little flat.  Tweedy was clearly operating in Farrar's shadow in
    Uncle Tupelo, and many of his songs (""Screen Door,"" for example) seem
    like they're trying too hard to achieve some sort of approval.
    Tweedy had developed into a distinct songwriter in his own right by
    the second half of Tupelo's existence, as evident here on ""Black Eye""
    and ""New Madrid.""  Both songs hint at the mysterious and complex
    lyrical turns he would explore later with Wilco.</p><p>
    
    When it was all said and done, Uncle Tupelo left a legacy far bigger
    than their recorded output.  Hordes of bands would pick up where they
    left off, and many would be content to stay right there.
    Fortunately, Uncle Tupelo had the good sense to split up when they
    did before they were forced to choose between upholding tradition or
    evolving into something else.  Like the Johnny Cash song, Uncle
    Tupelo walked the line, and were damn good at it.</p></div>"|8345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8345-8993-an-anthology/|7.8|Jason Nickey

    You know, that certain something that people are always whispering
    and giggling to each other about?  I've even read a couple interviews
    with the well-coifed duo where they flat-out ask them about it.  I
    think you see what I'm getting at here.  Wink, wink... nudge, nudge?
    Cough, cough?</p><p>
    
    That's right-- they're French.  Oh yeah, and I've also heard that
    some people consider <em>Moon Safari</em> to be the ultimate album for,
    ahem, makin' with the love.  Of course, Air can't be bothered with
    making music for such carnal matters anymore, preferring instead to
    make unsexy progtronica that only Trekkies could use in the bedroom.
    By submitting to silly notions of ""artistic growth"" (and by the way,
    those are ""Air quotes""), Air has left a serious void in the music
    world.  When <em>Moon Safari</em> has been played out, what's an indie
    couple to put on the stereo after a romantic candlelit vegan dinner
    and a Wes Anderson DVD?</p><p>
    
    Never fear, randy music lovers-- Zero 7 is here with an album-length
    homage to Air's notorious makeout soundtrack.  I use the word
    'homage', though I could just as easily use the phrase <em>blatant
    freaking ripoff.</em>  It's all semantics.  Zero 7 use the same
    instrumentation (organic drums, bass, guitar bed with lotsa Rhodes
    and synth), get the same production sound (front-and-center melodic
    smooooov bass), and explore the same saucy thematic territory.  The
    only Air-ish gimmick Zero 7 doesn't trot out here is the vocoder,
    which, given that it's been used recently by everyone from Cher to
    the White Stripes, is probably a wise decision.</p><p>
    
    But it's a beautiful spring day outside while I'm writing this, and
    my savage critical instincts have been blunted by sunshine and
    blooming trees, so I'll stick with 'homage.'  I've never been one to
    fault imitation-as-flattery as long as it's done well, whether that's
    the Stones and Dylan Xeroxes of <em>Nuggets</em> to the Wilson/Beatles
    worship of Elephant 6.  Zero 7 at least has the chops to be ar
    above-average Air cover band, from the ""Ce Matin La"" knockoff strings
    in the breakdown of ""Spinning"" to the familiarly spacey ""Give It
    Away"" and ""Out of Town.""</p><p>
    
    What I can't excuse, however, is schmaltzy lite-R&amp;B; crooning, which
    the two Brits behind Zero 7 seem to have an unfortunate weakness for.
    More than half of <em>Simple Things</em> features this nauseating
    dreck, from the quivery female-soul vocal clichés of Sia Furler
    (""Distractions"") and Sophie Barker (""In the Waiting Line"") to the
    Vandrossian male falsetto swings of Mozez (""This World"" and the title
    cut).  Without fail, these collaborations bring to mind the KZZZ
    easy-listening radio stations that exist primarily for piping into
    waiting rooms of allergists and dentists around the country.</p><p>
    
    The scary thing about these vocal tracks is how negligibly different
    their musical backing is from the infinitely more enjoyable
    instrumentals.  And given the more-than-passing resemblance to
    <em>Moon Safari</em>'s content, Zero 7 makes me wonder if Air was just
    a bad singer decision away from this kind of musical syrup.  I'm
    tempted to begrudge Zero 7 for retroactively spoiling my appreciatior
    for <em>Moon Safari.</em></p><p>
    
    But then again, Air is already Revlon's house band, so the commercial
    potential of this kind of limp-tronica isn't too shocking a
    realization.  Zero 7's cosmic instrumental journeys are no less
    marketable as hipster easy listening (""I feel like I should be driving
    in a hybrid car,"" my roommate commented during one listen).  If
    you're the kind of forgiving soul that can get past Zero 7's
    dalliances with copyright infringement, and if you have a CD player
    that can skip over the vocal tracks, <em>Simple Things</em> is a decent
    soundtrack to get your freak on.  Otherwise, go on and give the Air
    some air.</p></div>"|8940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8940-simple-things/|5.3|Rob Mitchum

Even if you have
    served him devoutly, his celestial countenance can so swiftly and
    capriciously turn on you. It takes sustained and meaningful sacrifice
    to keep you in Dub's favor.  Look at Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, once one of
    Dub's most devoted acolytes, now reduced to a whibbling mangle of his
    former self.  In order for Mad Professor to sustain his devotions and
    to avert Dub's punishing neglect, Tracey Thorn's body had to be
    separated from her head-- the resulting track, ""No Protection,"" is
    unquestionably superb, but poor Tracey's never quite been the same
    since. Some artists just aren't willing to do what it takes to
    fulfill their duties.  Look at XTC, whose dub project, <em>Explode
    Together</em>, was nothing more than a clanking jumble of sound.  The
    once fearsome Groove Corporation, the former motor behind Billy Ray
    Martin's Electribe 101 project, now fumble about remixing Ennio
    Morricone and Ella Fitzgerald's version of ""Sunshine of Your Love""
    for feckless triphop twats.  How long before such dolts attempt a dub
    of Frank Sinatra's ""Mrs. Robinson""?  Dub will smite them sore in
    their minuscule loins for sending The Chairman's ""doobie-doos"" into
    the chambers of Dub's duplicitous handmaiden, Echo!</p><p>
    
    Now, Dub doesn't shrink from allowing his worshippers to indulge in a
    little bit of fusion. Moritz von Oswald has formulated his own very
    sacrosanct liturgy by combining dub with Detroit-Berlin techno which
    has resulted in the consistently astounding Rhythm and Sound and
    Burial Mix set-ups.  But it's in Jamaica where the ruffest fusion
    takes place. Anyone who's partaken of the Now Thing service can
    attest to the orgiastic writhing that Dub, in his dancehall avatar,
    can inspire.</p><p>
    
    The contributors to <em>Meteosound</em>, however, align themselves more
    with von Oswald than to Sly and Lenky.  Select Cuts has previously
    issued the two volumes of remixes of the Blood and Fire reissue
    label, allowing Leftfield, Don Letts, and the Orb to have their
    wicked way with original vintage dub cuts such as Glen Brown and King
    Tubby's  ""Lambsbread Dub,"" Scientist's ""Step It Up,"" and Keith
    Hudson's  ""I'm Alright.""  Select Cuts have joined with Daniel Meteo,
    the organizer of the Meteosound dub nights at Berlin's Maria Am
    Ostbahnhof club to produce a concise overview of the current state of
    European dubbery. </p><p>
    
    Vienna's Sugar B lays down the first slab of righteousness with an
    edit of his ""Authentic Dub Disco,"" with which he stokes smoky flames
    of herbal wisdom from a single horn sample of ancient provenance.
    Tikiman follows on with the appropriately vital ""The Sound"" which
    rides a steppa rhythm with a direct connection to the Orb's skanky
    ""Blue Room.""</p><p>
    
    After such historically informed takes on the style, it's up to a
    slew of laptoppers to show how to worship Dub in a glitch style.
    ""Tetris"" Tom Thiel, a member of Orb-affiliates Sun Electric, takes a
    bunch of Rechenzentrum soundfiles and scuffs them up into a
    sickeningly coherent megamix. Thiel then joins with Meteo under the
    Bus alias for ""Treasure Island,"" in which a dirty bass line and lazy
    marimba force dancehall queens to mix with chill-out beach bums. Not
    content with forcing two antithetical groups to mingle, Bus then
    remix Dntel's glitch-addled ""Fear of Corners"" and thereby make it
    compulsory for all hipsters to imagine themselves in Gorgon
    dreadlocks and jamming in a Niyabinghi drum session.</p><p>
    
    The presence of Thomas Fehlmann (Dr. Alex Patterson's studio partner)
    confirms the Orb importance as the most visible torch bearer for Dub
    during the wilderness years of the early 1990's. With
    ""Seerosengiessen"" Fehlmann does not disgrace either himself or the
    good doctor. In fact, the drifting bliss of ""Seerosengiessen"" might
    finally encourage Alex to sever all ties with the tiresome Goa-trance
    cobblers of System 7.</p><p>
    
    While frequent Dub-botherers Manasseh and the Equalizer reach deep
    back into the fountain of vintage dub for their conga-and-wood-block-driven
    ""King of the Land,"" the A/B vs. Mina contribution, ""A to Dub"" resumes
    the indie rock dub action as A/B unearth previously hidden science by
    combining Mina's math rock with an update of King Jammy's Casiotone
    digital style.  Fehlmann returns with quirk-pop starlette Barbara
    Morgenstern for ""Shazzi Riddem,"" a surprisingly splendid combination of
    the Chemical Brothers-in-dub and ""Superstition""-era Stevie Wonder. </p><p>
    
    Meteosound closes with Jah Meek and Rootsman's ""Beautiful World,"" a
    confident homage to the prophetic heart of dub. With all of the power
    of one of Sizzla's sermons Jah Meek and Rootsman make a simple
    statement about the beauty that surrounds us all, movingly and
    gorgeously.</p><p>
    
    No contributor to <em>Meteosound</em> need fear the wrath of the
    almighty Dub. In fact,  I'd wager that the god will fill each of
    these artists' crocus bags with the finest Lambsbread for outlining
    how diverse and faithful Dub devotions can be and how, even in the
    anti-Caribbean of Berlin, you can fulfill your sata duties with
    one-love and obeah.</p></div>"|1977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1977-meteosound/|7.6|Paul Cooper

First there was the cheesy popcraft of
    Julian, then came the cutesy annoyance that was Sean, and now, out of
    nowhere, comes a third Lennon brat convinced he possesses some shred
    of his father's musical talent.  But no, this is not an
    as-yet-unheard-from member of the Lennon brood: Don Lennon is a
    longtime Beantown scenester with not a trace of Liverpudlian blood in
    him, but who still seems to have inherited much of John's sardonic
    wit.  Though his songs can be scathing, Don Lennon's gift is in the
    ambiguity, subtlety, and irony with which he handles his subjects.</p><p>
    
    And the subjects covered on <em>Downtown</em> include Lenny Kravitz,
    Kramer, John Cale, the Boston music scene, gay nightlife, and Dave
    Matthews-- who enthralls Lennon enough to devote two songs to the ice
    cream-hawking huckster.  On opener ""Really Dave Matthews,"" Lennon
    sings about gaining acceptance by pretending to be a Matthews fan,
    and it's both funny and a little sad. On ""Matthews Comes Alive,""
    Lennon assumes the role of Dave himself, recounting the band's rise
    to stardom, from the first nervous gig to playing at the ""Earth Day
    festival"" to a level of ubiquity where songs start appearing at
    ""cookouts on Cape Cod"" and at ""Chili's Bar and Grill.""  It's scathing
    without being heavy-handed. After all, the best put-downs are those
    the person you're putting down only half gets.</p><p>
    
    ""Lenny Kravitz and Lisbon"" warns of oversized Lenny concert posters
    threatening the city, and in a roundabout way, satirizes the false
    love touring artists show the places they visit. ""Gay Fun"" is the
    kind of song that, in lesser hands, might be considered offensive or
    simply trite, but it's good-natured fun for Lennon.  The ballads
    ""Mekons Come to Town"" and ""The Night Kramer Met Anne"" cheekily spin
    yarns of indie rock icons with overwrought arrangements and the
    aching sincerity in Lennon's voice.</p><p>
    
    Musically, <em>Downtown</em> sounds a little like Belle &amp; Sebastian
    fronted by Bruce McCulloch from ""Kids in the Hall."" The arrangements
    are jazzy, light, breezy-- some have a West Coast country rock
    vibe, while others have a certain baroque touch. Strings, horns,
    keyboards, and sax (courtesy of Morphine's Dane Colley) make the
    album varied without sounding forcibly eclectic or random.  But
    the main ingredient holding everything together is Lennon's detached
    delivery and wide-eyed romanticism-- a formula highly reminiscent of
    fellow Bostonian Jonathan Richman.</p><p>
    
    ""John Cale"" ends the album on beautiful note, with soaring strings
    and Lennon's most accomplished vocal moment. Richman's influence is
    heavily apparent as Lennon sings lyrics like, ""Fucked up on heroin
    and speed-- in the back of someone's car-- saying all these nasty
    things about Lou Reed,"" and still somehow make it sound like the
    theme to a children's television show.</p><p>
    
    It's in this way-- through ambiguity and by not laying all his cards
    on the table all at once-- that Lennon manages to take a bundle of
    humorous observations about pop culture figures and raise it above a
    simple collection of cheap laughs. As long as he doesn't get sued and
    cave in to cynicism, Don should be the musical Lennon to watch-- even
    if he never gets to date a member of Cibo Matto.</p></div>"|4729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4729-downtown/|7.5|Jason Nickey

    band, the Promise Ring, issued a song called ""Make Me a Mixtape.""  It's
    understandable that, in his condition, the about-30-years-old lisp-singer would
    re-evaluate his and the Promise Ring's place in the Grand Scheme.  So it's odd,
    then, that his latest album, which jumps from the one-finger ""power"" pop of
    previous records to mellow bells-n-thistles studioscapes, feels more like failed
    market research than soul searching.</p><p>
    Saves the Day and Dashboard Confessional's success must knot TPR's tight little
    vintage t-shirts in a bunch.  The Promise Ring were way ahead of the curve with
    that stuff; on their first seven-inch, they sketched the emo template with a
    mechanical pencil rubbing of Sunny Day Real Estate.  Then, over the course of a
    few gigs at Fireside Bowl, Von Bohlen whittled his songwriting down to the sound
    of two guitars and two hands clapping.  The ba-ba-ba's of Pepsi-shilling sheep
    replaced the whines and cries of college guys lamenting unbearable distances
    (154 miles, typically) between upstate public universities and hometown honies.
    At first, emo purists-- and those kids really knew how to stand for something--
    guffawed.  But this scene criticism gave way to wholesale copping.  Hey, this
    new minimal guitar pop was easier to play, and more favorable with girls.  You
    could even sing it suckin' on a Dum-Dum.   And this Dashboard Confessional tiger
    bop comes along looking like John Stamos' idea of Social Distortion repeating the
    embarrassment of TPR's <i>30 Degrees Everywhere</i>?  Calling this trend vanilla
    is an insult to good ice-cream and yogurt everywhere.</p><p>
    Now into these bands' wake jumps the Promise Ring, arms extended for that golden
    ring.  First thing you notice visually is the absence of the two chubby older
    guys.  ""Make Me a Mixtape"" and ""Happiness Is All the Rage"" are hard to swallow
    coming from guys who should have at least 10G's in their 401Ks.  Yes, it was back
    to Wisconsin for the bassist, and a steady diet of nothing for the guitarist, who
    now pulls his weight with the artwork and website.  Dig the new press kit with the
    two young ringers.  Excuse the cynicism, but this is business and we're talking
    about a band making their big shot at stardom.  Before hearing a note of
    <i>Wood/Water</i>, knowing the band's history and future at stake, and noting the
    enlistment of Britpop producer Stephen Street, one'd expect this disc to buzz and
    bounce like the Rentals or Menswear.  Which still doesn't sound very good on paper,
    but you can't expect Street to magically whip them into the Smiths or Blur.</p><p>
    The humdrum result actually droops and drips as much as the boggy fauna in the
    artwork.  Tracks one through three genre-jump like a band uncertain of which
    adult-indie trend to follow-- Coldplay or the Flaming Lips or, um, REM's
    <i>Monster</i>?  ""Size of Your Life"" lifts and weakly leaks the guitar from
    ""What's the Frequency Kenneth?"" as digital distortion strains to conceal Von
    Bohlen's toilet-paper tube larynx.  It's a test, not a song.  ""Stop Playing
    Guitar"" spews nonsensical lyrics: ""If I had a dime for/ Every time I should stop
    playing guitar/ And put my nose in a book/ My head would be healthy/ My guitar
    would be dusty.""  Finish that cliché!  Would you be rich?  Could you barely buy
    some vended Wahoos?  Accumulating dimes has nothing to do with head health.
    Granted, by putting his nose in a book, Von Bohlen would be protecting his
    delicate nasal cartiledge with pages, spine, and jacket.  But unless his skull
    is a bank, this has nothing to do with dimes.  ""Suffer Never"" follows, mimicking
    <i>The Soft Bulletin</i>'s ""Race for the Prize.""  It towers over the rest of the
    album, even if the Delgados, Mercury Rev, Lenola, Aspera, et al rip it off more
    convincingly.</p><p>
    From this point on, the disc sleepwalks through acoustic hangover ditties.  Davey
    yawns his vocals.  The band experiments with keyboards and percussion from beyond
    the realm of emo.  Thematically, the lyrics cover themes of apathy and out-growing.
    It's an album from a guy questioning whether he wants to make albums anymore-- the
    soundtrack to rubbing sleep from your eyes.  So it slogs and slogs and slogs and
    slogs, until... oh my god, until ""Say Goodbye Good.""</p><p>
    Undoubtedly this will be the song everyone talks about.  It was crafted for such a
    response.  The track saddles everything that is lamentable about the Promise Ring
    with everything that is lamentable in overwrought rock albums.  A choir and strings
    swell from typical non-clever wordplay and it's-serious-because-it's-slow plodding.
    The target is obviously songs in the ilk of Spiritualized, Blur's ""Tender,"" Smog's
    ""Knock Knock,"" and the epitome, ""You Can't Always Get What You Want.""  Indeed.
    Mario Caldato Jr. mixes in misplaced electro-phase effects and Quincy McCrary.
    What, don't know Quincy?  He sang back-up for Lionel Richie and Jennifer Love
    Hewitt.</p><p>
    Smooth soul wails from Q, like an elevator version of Clare Torry on ""The Great
    Gig in the Sky,"" launching the song into pure parody.  For such a supposed
    introspective record, session singers with no connection to the music betray the
    band's intent.  At this point, Von Bohlen is M.I.A., an admission that something
    must be done to compensate for the complete lack of melody in his voice.  Simply
    one of the most laughable and misguided songs of all step-up-to-the-big-boys
    releases, ""Say Goodbye Good"" immolates all positive new directions from the band.
    TPR even fail to recognize the finality and place of such Epic Songs on Big Albums
    and tack on another meaningless solo guitar tune afterwards.</p><p>
    From a commercial standpoint, <i>Wood/Water</i> misses the boat where another
    predictable pop album like <i>Very Emergency</i> could have hit big.  Experimentation
    is admirable, but you can't put a Sizzler sirloin on a gold plate and call it a
    filet.  What seems like an attempt to market records to a growing thirtysomething
    market-- guys who groove to Starsailor while Swiffering the hardwood-- sounds
    entirely miscast.  The Promise Ring last sounded like themselves on <i>Nothing
    Feels Good</i>, and from here there's always idyllictronica.</p></div>"|6492.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6492-woodwater/|3.2|Brent DiCrescenzo

    concerts have been poorly documented on record.  <em>Streams of
    Whiskey</em> is a re-release of a bootleg, <em>Live on Rain Street</em>,
    from a 1991 show in Switzerland.  Typical for a bootleg, the sound is
    terrible and the performance is rough.  The Pogues, who are planning
    an ""official"" live album from their reunion tour, are asking fans not
    to buy this: they weren't consulted on the release and aren't happy
    with the quality.</p><p>
    
    If you're not already familiar with the classic 80s punk band, the
    Pogues are hard to define.  Creating their sound on traditional Irish
    instruments, they rocked harder and played wilder shows with tin
    whistle and accordion than most of their guitar-trashing
    contemporaries.  The band played tight and floor-pounding music, yet
    Shane MacGowan, the wrecked but strangely babyfaced singer, was an
    increasingly erratic performer.  Rightly called one of the great
    modern Irish lyricists-- writing about the low and downtrodden with
    uncommon eloquence-- MacGowan would play concerts too plowed to sing
    his own words.  He was notorious for wandering off-stage to care for
    his various addictions, and at a Chicago concert with the Popes last
    year, he even threw up on stage!  A more melodramatic artist would
    turn this self-destruction into performance art, but for MacGowan
    it's just who he is: there's nothing romantic about it-- especially
    when the audience fights over his vomit-streaked towels, as they did
    at that Popes gig.</p><p>
<em>Streams of Whiskey</em> takes the subtleties and peculiar genius of
    the Pogues and smashes them into a big loud mess.  The concert took
    place after <em>Hell's Ditch</em>, the last album MacGowan made with
    the band, and the fourteen songs cover all of their records together.
    They start with exciting performances of ""Streams of Whiskey,"" ""If I
    Should Fall from Grace with God,"" and a tight reading of ""Sally
    MacLennane.""  It's also interesting to hear Philip Chevron take the
    vocals on his song ""Thousands Are Sailing"" (MacGowan sings it on the
    original)-- his singing is more earnest and heartfelt.  MacGowan's
    own vocals get progressively worse throughout the show; he hacks out
    ""Dirty Old Town"" like phlegm from his lungs, and the otherwise
    terrific lyrics to ""The Sickbed of Cuchulainn"" just slur together.</p><p>
    
    The poor quality of the album keeps even the best numbers from living
    up to the studio versions.  Now that this is packaged as a real
    release instead of a bootleg, it comes off as a substandard product.
    The mix is incompetent, for starters: Terry Woods' vocals are cut off
    on ""Young Ted of the Hill,"" and on songs like ""The Sunny Side of the
    Street,"" MacGowan's singing and Spider Stacey's tin whistle come
    through loud and clear (with every bum note on display) while the
    rest of the band is stuck in a murk.  To add insult to injury,
    MacGowan's name is even misspelled on the cover.</p><p>
    
    This would deserve a worse rating, except that ultimately, it's too
    damn much fun.  This was obviously a great concert and everyone is
    having a blast.  And no matter how sloppy MacGowan gets, he's still a
    hell of a frontman.  His stuporous singing and the farting horn
    sounds on ""Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah"" don't stop the song from
    rocking.  From the title track through ""Fiesta,"" the band is
    unrelenting, and it sounds like you're listening from the second row,
    mashed in by hundreds of screaming fans.  This may not be an
    essential album, but it's a great souvenir for the hardcore fans.
    Everyone else should wait for the <i>real</i> live album, just like the
    Pogues want you to.</p></div>"|6364.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6364-streams-of-whiskey/|6.0|Chris Dahlen

    be allowed to use Aphex Twin as a point of comparison anymore. [Uh,
    Dave... didn't you get the memo?  -Ed.] With a body of work as
    ubiquitous as Richard D. James', saying something sounds like Aphex
    Twin seems on par with a pop critic who compares everything he hears
    to the Beatles. It's not that the comparisons to James are irrelevant
    or untrue (good luck finding a bedroom composer who wasn't at least
    slightly influenced by him)-- it's just that the connection could be
    drawn without saying.</p><p>
    
    And yet, there are those times when such a comparison deems itself
    necessary.  Like the premiere album from Loess-- the second release
    from Nonresponse, a label which previously brought us Codec Scovill's
    <em>Clinical Imperfections</em>.  In fact, Loess' members are two-thirds of
    Codec Scovill.  And though the music they make under the two guises
    shares a similar dark beauty, the two groups are set apart by more
    than names.  Loess aims for a fuller sound, adding bass and beats to
    the elemental backdrops of <em>Clinical Imperfections.</em>  But while
    these more traditional elements make Loess more accessible than Codec
    Scovill, they don't necessarily make it better. The songs on Loess
    are plenty enjoyable, but they're nothing we haven't heard before.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us back to good ol' Richard James. Loess' arrangements
    are built around old-school beats that unfold over long dramatic
    waves of synths, creeping between crescendo and decrescendo over long
    expanses of time, yet always in tune with the occasionally
    unpredictable beats.  Of course, if you're going to rip off anyone,
    Aphex Twin is a good choice.  There's nothing wrong with wearing your
    influences on your sleeve, so long as they're just that-- influences.
    Loess has plenty of moments that are distinctly their own, which
    promise of greater things to come.  There's the prepared piano
    that weaves its way through ""Spring Street,"" for instance. It begins
    with just a heavy repetitive clunking, alongside incoming waves of
    synths and glitches, but it soon transforms into something reminiscent
    of a John Carpenter score-- the on-edge tinkering gives the track a nice
    creepy bent.</p><p>
    
    Then there's the ten-minute ambient piece that appears out of the
    silence after the last track, which trades beats for a low rumbling--
    barely audible, slowly shifting high-pitched tones and a chorus of
    sopranos looped and layered upon one another.  Or the beats which
    loiter aimlessly through the dark, questioning murk of drawn-out chords
    of ""2nd Twelve.""  Small crackles linger behind each beat, like the
    smell of sulfur that remains even after a match goes out.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, the beats themselves are what save Loess from falling in with
    a seemingly endless line of imitators. No mere drum machines here, the
    sounds themselves are rather unique.  They appear to be lo-fi recordings
    of simple everyday sounds, garbled, chopped up and painstakingly molded
    into patterns.  It's this vaguely organic feel that keeps me from pointing
    out that songs like ""Pleuston"" and ""Maple Cill"" sound, at times, an awful
    lot like something off the first <em>Selected Ambient Works</em> comp.</p><p>
    
    But artists have always learned by stealing. And there has always
    been a distinction between those who are mere copycats and those who
    build upon the work of others by developing a style all their own.
    Loess falls clearly into the latter category. There are enough moments
    on Loess' self-titled debut to distinguish them from their inspirations--
    enough ingenuity in the building blocks of the songs to prove that these
    guys are hardly Xerox artists. Give them some time to evolve, keep an open
    ear, and give in to the subtle rhythms. You'll be hearing great things from
    them in the future.</p></div>"|4827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4827-loess/|7.6|David M. Pecoraro

He overcomes this comparisor
    by 1) not really sounding very much like Zappa (although he does tend
    to favor similar instrumentation), and 2) by remaining alive.  By
    default, Marcoeur wins, right?  Not if notoriety has any bearing or
    the decision, because most of his albums were very hard to come by
    until the percussionist/clarinet player/composer got his act in gear
    by setting up a website and reissuing his first record from 1974.  As
    French avant-rockers with a flair for flutes go, Marcoeur has toiled
    in relative obscurity for quite a while, so I hardly blame you if you
    have no idea who I'm talking about.</p><p>
    
    Born in 1947, Marcoeur studied clarinet as a child at a music and
    drama conservatory, later joining rock and R&amp;B; bands while ir
    school (a lot like Zappa, come to think of it).  He switched to drums
    in the mid-1960's with his band The Lake's Men, who were keen or
    making it big in Paris with the hip sound of soul (Marcoeur said they
    wanted to ""back black singers"").  From 1970-73 Marcoeur and pals
    acted as resident studio musicians for Frémontel Studios, and had
    ample opportunity to work out their ambitions in between backing
    whatever pop stars who happened to be recording there.  All of this
    seems pretty pedestrian until you actually hear what it was they were
    working on.  Marcoeur's sound is a fusion of Zappa-esque jazz-rock
    (circa <i>Hot Rats</i>), Kurt Weill's common-man art song and strange,
    classically tinged art-rock.  Apparently, the soul ambitions were
    left on the back burner.</p><p>
    
    Marcouer's first album, from 1974, is the work of an already
    well-prepared artist.  The arrangements are all ace (and unique--
    featuring recorders, exotic percussion, with an emphasis on acoustic
    textures over electric ones), the playing airtight, while the songs
    all seem to have been written by an estranged circus freak.  ""C'est
    Rate, C'est Rate"" begins with a loping, hard funk groove and
    harmonium doubling the acoustic guitar's spook-riff, as all the while
    Marcoeur explains who knows what in French.  There are mini-clangs
    going off in the background (sounds like someone playing a few broker
    cowbells), and then it breaks away to an incredible chorus, a cross
    between some unplugged punk band and a carnival barker.  It's quite
    surreal, as are many of the best moments on this album.</p><p>
    
    ""Simone"" features Marcoeur's wheezy clarinet stylings, as well as a
    recorder line that is most similar to the sound of a coffee maker's
    burbles stuck on repeat.  The downtrodden blues groove gives the song
    an all-important strangeness, and the coda, with a beautiful clarinet
    melody supported by bells and guitar, seems a bit random.  Yet, ir
    the spirit of the album, it makes sense.  Same goes for the acrobatic
    ""Tu tapes trop fort,"" with its circus beat and New Years' noisemaker
    sax figure, leading to a chorus of some guy hammering wood in a shack
    somewhere.  It's at once totally goofy and at the same time the best
    thing Mark Mothersbaugh didn't write for <em>Rushmore.</em></p><p>
    
    The least interesting music happens when Marcoeur plays it straight,
    as on the smooth lounge-balladry of ""Que le Temps Est Long"" (nice
    Astrid Gilberto impression, except for that strange middle part with
    the shouting and trombones).  The tune sticks out like a sore thumb
    on this record, especially as it's preceded by primal space jazz,
    then followed by a song that I can only describe as what happens wher
    musique concrete, can-can music and frantic free-rock mingle
    unabated.  Marcoeur released two more albums in the 1970s (also
    regarded as classics by a small community of freaks) and continues to
    record and put out stuff today.  Though Marcoeur remains ever
    obscure, I'll do my part by giving you the leg up on this album, and
    allow the circus freak in you to proceed with abandon.</p></div>"|5105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5105-albert-marcoeur/|8.2|Dominique Leone

    unforgiving crowbar of Jeff Gilooly, a famous rabbi posed the following question
    to God: ""If you, God, are so great, then why do bad things happen to good people?
    That is, if God is so good, why evil?  Shant Nancy have been spared the rod?""
    Although ordinarily fairly reflective and considerate, God, in this instance,
    wasn't much for patience or tact. ""Kushner,"" he replied, ""are you fucking
    <em>daft?</em>""  Only then did the rabbi realize his error-- Kerrigan, in fact, was
    <i>not</i> good. No, Kerrigan was a bitch-- God knew it, the rabbi knew it, hell,
    even Gilooly knew it. She got what was coming to her.</p><p>
    
    Picking up on the rabbi's apparent dilemma, Califone hath chosen for its newest
    album title the converse of that age old conundrum. Yes, bad things happen to
    good people, but what about the demonic among us?  What about the Hitlers, the
    Linda Tripps, the Big Poppa Lou Pearlmans? What about them? According to Califone,
    even minions like Tripp and Pearlman share in the bounty. This claim, however,
    obviously lacks substance. Because as much as good weather may follow bad people,
    it also clearly follows some really good people, as evidenced by the band's own
    career.</p><p>
    
    The Chicago-based ambient neo-folk band Califone was formed way back in the late
    90s by two musicians (Brian Deck and Tim Hurley) and two pasta dishes, Rutili and
    Massarella, and rose from the ashes of another respected Chicago blues-rock outfit,
    Red Red Meat. Subsequent to that band's breakup, the four remaining members pulled
    a Voltron and came back hard, but with a new and innovative musical approach:
    blending southwestern Americana, blues, and bleak, rugged folk with updated,
    atmospheric percussion and drum programming. The result was at once unique and
    compelling. <i>Good Weather Follows Bad People</i> is the condensed, environmentally
    friendly reissue of Califone's first two critically acclaimed EPs, with the
    addition of two unreleased bonus tracks.</p><p>
    
    The first seven tracks are drawn from Califone's self-titled 1998 debut EP for
    the defunct indie label Flydaddy.  Among the highlights are... well, all of them.
    Yes, each of these seven are damn near golden, including the damp, bass-heavy
    opener, ""On the Steeple with the Shakes,"" the punchy, rustic folk of ""Silvermine
    Pictures,"" and the lonely, emotive distance and sparseness of the guitar and
    piano riffing on ""Dime Fangs."" Tracks 8-12 are culled from the band's second EP,
    a 1999 Road Cone effort. The EP was less mood and composition-oriented than the
    debut, actually employing discernable songwriting elements like hummable choruses
    and bridges, as on ""St. Martha Let It Fold"" and the quasi-pop of ""Beneath the
    Yachtsman."" Still, though, the same innovative approach remained, solidified by
    Rutili's restrained and expressive vocal grit.</p><p>
    
    Being as it is a re-release, the question for fanatics is whether the two bonus
    tracks are enough to warrant another purchase. The answer for fanatics is no,
    they're not. One of them is a retread of ""To Hush a Sick Transmission,"" already
    the least listenable track on the debut EP. The closer is ""When the Snakehandler
    Slips,"" a dark, aggressive, full-band tune featuring more tempo and fuzzy
    distortion in everything-- vocals, guitar, and bass. It's a decent track, but by
    no means indispensable. Newcomers, on the other hand, will find <i>Good Weather</i>
    to be a perfect starting point.</p></div>"|1235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1235-sometimes-good-weather-follows-bad-people/|8.5|Brad Haywood

They play improvisational music
    and mostly lay down live takes, no processing.  Glenn Donaldson and Stephen Smith
    were former members of psychedelicists Mirza, sound collagist Loren Chasse has
    worked with Id Battery, and pianist Rob Reger provides the most distinctive
    element of the band's sound-- his piano lines add a slight sense of structure to
    the instrumental meanderings.  Thuja don't write songs, per se.  Rather, their
    albums flow together like field recordings of poltergeists romping through
    abandoned factories.  It's intense, sometimes dissonant music, but often highly
    rewarding.</p><p>
    The review of Thuja's <i>The Deer Lay Down Their Bones</i> was my first for
    Pitchfork, so it might be forgiven that I never quite said outright what I was
    getting at.  I mentioned that one of the virtues of ambient and improv music is
    that you can pay different levels of attention to it.  It's an ideal form of
    music to play while at work, because you can get too caught up in pop songs and
    their catchy choruses.  But I neglected to illustrate the implications of Thuja's
    music, which sounds for all the world like springs busting out of clockfaces at
    times.  Their structural unsteadiness was a secret pleasure for me during the
    nine-to-five, a way to fantasize the collapse of all the machines of industry.</p><p>
<i>Ghost Plants</i> is more of the same.  Again, with the new album's title and
    the tree photo in the insert, they seem to make an appeal to nature.  The cedar
    (genus: Thuja) can cause dermatitis to those who touch its sap, but refined
    tinctures can ease a variety of toxic reactions.  Ghost plants, a more informal
    grouping, are defined by their benign nature, so it's interesting that the music
    here should be more dark than that of the band's debut.  You're greeted with the
    death knell of a chandelier, almost, sounds of glass fracturing and being swept
    about.  Enter a guitar chord, plucked over and over, monotonous, dull yet
    aggressive.  A few piano notes whisper from some faded place, but it does little
    to temper the alien modem-garble patches of noise.</p><p>
    Each of the tracks are untitled, but they cut between each other more obviously
    now.  Track three begins abruptly with hand-drumming and chainlike rattling,
    shackles being shaken perhaps.  It's the only overt rhythm on the entire album,
    but of course the funk quickly fades from the musique concrète to be replaced by
    thick keyboard hum and phantom synth oscillations.  The stark, oppressive
    atmosphere moves towards a more quiet, fluid flow by track six.  Reger taps out
    short Morse code messages on the piano, and slivers of heartfelt melody are
    wrangled out of the guitar.  The piano cadences and reverbed clangs later on
    would feel dissonant if left on their own, but cycled together they create a
    whirlpool similar to Günter Müller and L\xEA Quan Ninh's work on <i>La Voyelle
    Liquide</i>.</p><p>
    The album shifts into a more appreciable silence, but could hardly be called
    peaceful.  There's a moment when you realize the silt that's been sifting
    through the background is gradually becoming a giant cloud of distortion,
    shimmering prettily and yet hiding disturbing things inside like the best
    Ah Cama-Sotz tracks.  And though there are signs of Harold Budd-style minimalist
    composition near the end, the faintest sample of a woman's voice singing
    wordlessly probably ends things best.  Thuja's environmental allusions just don't
    hold truck; I'll opt for the other image in the title: <i>Ghost Plants</i> as
    phantom factories.  If <i>The Deer Lay Down Their Bones</i> was the sound of
    those rusty iron cogs turning, these later tracks are the humming power sources
    that feed the wheels.  Though I preferred the more consistent segues on the
    debut, it's amazing that this music is played by human beings.  Fans of the
    Shalabi Effect and Einstürzende Neubauten would do well to track this one down.</p></div>"|8050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8050-ghost-plants/|7.9|Christopher Dare

    In the spirit of further full disclosure, I should divulge that I know next to
    nothing about electronic music.  No Mark Richard-San am I.  I don't know techno
    from Tecmo.  The expansive terminology and rapid genre proliferation frighten me
    and give me indigestion.  And generally, IDM makes me feel, well... very un-I.</p><p>
    
    Okay, so for the three or four people reading who still respect my opinion on this
    album, I think <i>Disco Nouveau</i> is a pretty neat compilation-- and with excellent
    packaging!  I came to this conclusion by holding it up to my highly scientific
    three-question yes/no electronic music evaluation:</p><p>
    
    1. Does it make me feel cooler when I play it in my car?  A. Yes.</p><p>
    
    2. Does it conjure up mental pictures of robots and/or people in sequined outfits
    dancing wildly in some kind of retro-futuristic club?  A. Yes.</p><p>
    
    3. Does it make me feel sexy?  A. Well, not really.  But as Mr. Loaf once said,
    two out of three ain't bad.</p><p>
    
    The disco nouveau sound, according to the extensive liner notes, was a
    late-70s-to-early-80s movement bridging the gap between the heyday of Studio 54
    and the rise of rave culture.  To me, it sounds like the electronic music
    equivalent of old-school rap-- poppy and accessible, with somewhat primitive
    beats over which a David Gahan or Simon LeBon vocal would not sound out of place.
    This compilation features fourteen international and presumably well known (even
    I've heard of some of 'em) artists composing original tributes to this glitzy era.</p><p>
    
    What this means is no less than three tracks starting off with beats reminiscent
    of ""Billie Jean,"" a definite plus in my book.  Given the movement's infiltration
    into a lot of early-80s pop music, I'm obliged to go for tracks that most recall
    my childhood MTV habit, like Adult's classic combo of synths and handclaps and
    monotone female vocals on ""Nite Life.""  My inner child is further stroked by
    electro-kitsch act DMX Krew teaming up with vocalist Tracy for ""Make Me,"" a
    collaboration that lands somewhere between ABBA and Madonna's early NYC club
    days.</p><p>
    
    Other tracks downplay vocals and are slightly more sonically complex, though never
    to the point of losing danceability.  With its eerie background noises, funky
    guitar, and rubbery bassline, Mat-101's ""Haunted House"" could be the theme song
    for some blaxploitation/disco horror flick.  Charles Manier's ""Change You"" employs
    live drums and percussion in either a polyrhythmic Afrobeat style, lending the
    track a propulsive edge over its compatriots.</p><p>
    
    The downside of the compilation's theme is that all fourteen artists seem to be
    referencing the same inspirations-- primarily the light-up floor anthems of
    Giorgio Moroder.  This makes for a somewhat homogenous affair, and by the end of
    the disc's 75 minutes, it becomes a challenge to figure out when one track ended
    and the next began.  Furthermore, any form of disco doesn't exactly lend itself
    to emotional range, and <i>Disco Nouveau</i> is no exception.  Even Solvent's ""My
    Radio,"" the lyrics of which mourn the death of a favorite 80s radio station, has
    all the reflective somberness of a Bee Gees concert.</p><p>
    
    But I'm no dummy-- I realize this is largely a compilation for hip cocktail
    soirees and the Friday night drive to the club-- not for chin-stroking and reading
    Tolstoy.  It's not blowing my mind or expanding my musical horizons much, but it
    is right up my alley as far as electronic music's concerned, especially considering
    I'm roughly fifteen years behind the curve.  At the very least, it'll give my
    well-worn copy of <i>Rio</i> the occasional break.</p></div>"|1897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1897-disco-nouveau/|7.3|Rob Mitchum

Things are falling everywhere, as if the room I'm
    sitting in will break apart at any moment.  How can these people play like this,
    without concern for their instruments or ears, and with so much drive?  They are
    staining the walls of the studio with violent noise.  It's off-putting to say the
    least.  I can hear bells and lots of drums, and deep down, there's something
    electronic-- perhaps guitar feedback.  And I can hear sine waves-- Yoshihide and
    Sachiko M are forever playing sine waves now.  The waves' howling is terribly
    overwhelmed by the rest of this cacophony.  It's a fucking hurricane!  How can
    Yoshihide have planned for this to happen?  Why would anyone want this much chaos
    and lack of restraint?  Maybe they don't care anymore, or maybe it's the kind of
    thing that sounds better on paper than it does in reality.  This sounds like hell,
    or at least what the journey to hell might sound like.</p><p>
    
    And yet, this is oddly hypnotic at the same time.  I can't imagine anyone sitting
    down in front of their stereo listening to this like they might listen to a normal
    song, but I don't want to remove my headphones, either.  It's a huge rock tumbling
    down a mountain, and I want to see how it destroys anything in its path, and
    whether or not it will yet destroy itself.  And that is truly what this is:
    destructive and excessive.  I've heard how the musicians were instructed to bang
    and stomp, making new sounds before the old ones ever had a chance to disintegrate.
    Each sound is trampled over by its successor, just like twigs under a boulder.
    And the worst part is that when it finally hits bottom, nothing happens.  The
    thing simply stops, unnaturally, without slowing down or being broken into smaller
    rocks.</p><p>
    
    The rolling giant seems to have parked next to a swamp at the base of the mountain,
    as there are lots of watery sound effects (probably from Sachiko's and Tetuzi
    Akiyama's microphones), and a scummy residue from what sounds like large Asian
    cymbals.  The atmosphere has quickly become static, and despite a loud gong crash,
    I still feel the humidity and stillness.  For this part of the piece, I read how
    the players were instructed not to listen to each other.  If this is true, then
    why do they remain so consistently in ""harmony""?  There aren't any tonalities to
    speak of, but the nine members of the orchestra do sound as if they're working
    towards a common goal.  And this is distinctly symphonic music: each part is
    essential, as Yoshihide has chosen the perfect arrangement to fulfill his murky
    impressions.  But this is improvised music, so how could there be impressions at
    work, from the composer's point of view?  And ultimately, how much credit should
    be given to Yoshihide at all?  The second movement of his ""symphony"" is intimidating
    in its efficiency of movement and sound, but then again, it could all very well be
    one big accident.</p><p>
    
    The above are my impressions of the first half of Otomo Yoshihide's improvised
    suite, <i>Anode</i>.  As referenced, each movement contains specific instructions
    for the musicians as to what they are allowed to play, and even to whom they're
    allowed to listen.  Conceptually, it's similar to John Zorn's game pieces, wherein
    the ""rules"" determine the outcome of the music as much as the actual sounds
    produced (at least in theory).  The general strategy for the music is simple,
    though describing what actually happens from a listener's point of view can lead
    to any number of strange mental images and associations.  Impressionism?  Maybe,
    though probably only as impressions are immediate and sacrificed for the next.</p><p>
    
    Yoshihide plays guitar, and presumably conducts.  His background as a renegade
    turntablist, guitarist and all-purpose catalyst for free-improvised music in
    Japan is precedent enough for a record like <i>Anode</i>, though the sound should
    still surprise most people.  His most recent solo albums opt for near-ambient,
    ultra-minimal sine wave pulses and glitches.  And his small-group records with
    Filament (featuring Sachiko M) and I.S.O. venture even further into the sounds
    musicians can squeeze from computers and turntables without any actual source
    material to play.  Before all this, he led the seminal outfit Ground Zero, a band
    that blasted through so many barriers you might have had a hard time convincing
    yourself rock music wasn't invented for the sole purpose of the avant-garde.  But
    other than the companion piece, 1999's <i>Cathode</i>, very little of his work
    really sounds like the transparent impressionism of <i>Anode</i>.</p><p>
    
    The second half of the suite is almost a mirror image of the first, as the third
    movement continues the static ambience of the second, and the final movement
    witnesses the reemergence of the full ensemble: percussion crashing, microphones
    squealing, sine waves howling, and a general tumbling sensation prevailing.  My
    rating for this record is probably instable insofar as translating the ""depth"" of
    the piece (or remarkable lack thereof), and is based more on the obvious conceptual
    ambition at work.  I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people hearing <i>Anode</i>
    wanted off within seconds-- but they'd be missing a very intense experience.</p></div>"|8861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8861-anode/|7.8|Dominique Leone

He no longer finds
    any value in the accidental click-and-pop that once signified recorded entropy and
    fractured reality. Just like the sound of running water that appeared on every
    ambient disc ten years ago, clicks and glitches have lost all potency. They're now
    just another preset sound.</p><p>
    Endrass's <i>Vice Versa</i>, however, is not a wholesale return to the time before
    glitch. That sound is in the album, yet Endrass has reformatted it. <i>Vice Versa</i>,
    unlike Mouse on Mars' <i>Idiology</i> or Posthuman's <i>Uncertainty of the Monkey</i>,
    revels not in contrast or juxtaposition, but rather in interchangeability. Elements
    don't jar; they become subjugated to Endrass' harmonic concept.</p><p>
<i>Vice Versa</i> is a very confident album. It's a brave musician who kicks off
    an album with a fourteen-minute track. Yet Endrass' bravery is far from hubris.
    He produced over thirty vinyl releases before he issued his debut long-player,
    <i>Infam</i>, in 2001. Unfortunately, Endrass limited his vinyl productions to
    about 300 copes per title, and consequently, the Markant name was known more by
    reputation than by experience.</p><p>
    Endrass, answering only to himself, begins <i>Vice Versa</i> in a digital haze
    reminiscent of a cloud of well-meaning mosquitoes dancing about your ears. After
    nearly four minutes, the harmonic and melodic elements of the opening track,
    ""Spurwechsel,"" emerge. It's as though he's cleansing the listener in anticipation
    of the Markant concept of music.</p><p>
    Fortunately, Endrass has the skills to match his boast.  <i>Vice Versa</i> abounds
    in idiosyncratic and original melodic twists, dips, dives, and arches. Unlike
    Mouse on Mars who sometimes disguise their tunes in offbeat programming or
    Venusian ska-otica, Endrass doesn't parade prodigious programming abilities. Like
    Galerie Stratique or Isan, Endrass would rather expend energy on increasing the
    vocabulary of melody rather than gene-splicing sound.</p><p>
    Initially, I bemoaned the lack of sonic innovation, but after many listens, I've
    become more fascinated with the sedate glass harmonica beauty of ""Natura Morte""
    and the glacial drift of the title track. You might say that Geir Jensen (aka
    Biosphere) definitively mapped out this territory with 1997's <i>Substrata</i>,
    or that Thomas Köner took ambience to its bleak extreme with 1998's <i>Kaamos</i>.
    And you could say that ""Deserto"" compares just as favorably to <i>Amber</i>-era
    Autechre, or that ""Laissez Faire"" sounds like Global Communications' mechanized
    excursions under the Reload moniker.  And I couldn't even disagree with you.  But
    I would retort that no one should visit a place just once.  Endrass' terrain may
    be familiar, but his assessment of them is utterly his own.</p></div>"|5110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5110-vice-versa/|7.8|Paul Cooper

After
    I gave Cerberus Shoal's 1999 album <i>Homb</i> a 7.5, I worried whether it should
    have been scored lower.  I liked their solemn approach to left-field post-rock,
    but would others find it too serious and self-important?  Their follow-up, <i>Crash
    My Moon Yacht</i>, took a dip down in quality, from the over-exuberant <i>Lion King</i>
    Africana of ""Yes Sir, No Sir"" to the hippie-dance vibe of ""Asphodel.""  The band
    seemed to grow in expressive talent but the choral theatrics just didn't fly, which
    retroactively cast further doubt on the rating I'd given <i>Homb</i>.</p><p>
<i>Mr. Boy Dog</i> has been tagged as a major comeback, and as their ""hardest""
    album yet.  Maybe those descriptions came from critics hard-of-hearing; as with
    most double-disc albums, it's more of a spotty affair.  The key songs continue in
    the modus operandi of the six-member group, combining ethnic instrumentation with
    oddly tuned guitars and brass to create tumultuous works chock-full of bizarre
    surprises.  But the tracks between these epics indulge an ass-annoying experimental
    trend.  <i>Mr. Boy Dog</i>'s twelve tracks total about seventy minutes, and though
    each set of six songs flows together in a loosely structured narrative, I can't
    help but think they would have fit better on one disc.</p><p>
    
    The first record begins with fierce start/stop squalls that share some real estate
    with Zorn's Naked City.  But the blurts quickly settle into ""Nataraja,"" a typical
    Cerberus piece featuring hand-drumming and slowly swooning horn lines that eventually
    lock into the kind of fluctuating arpeggios that (for better or worse) Philip Glass
    had already trademarked.  It's far too single-minded and compromised to realize
    its full potential.  Worse, ""Camel Bell"" follows, which begins promisingly with
    chiming glissandi but then busts into this absurd carnival arabesque, flinging
    itself headfirst into parody. The horns on this band's early albums added a nice
    depth to the bass/guitar/drums setup, but here there's a lot of pomp and too little
    circumstance.</p><p>
    
    In case you had any doubts that there's a joke being played, ""Tongue Drongue""
    begins with six minutes of belch-like vocals.  It's not challenging, it's not the
    Shoal channeling the ghost of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and hopefully, it's nothing
    more than a field recording of someone croaking drunkenly.  Maybe now I know what
    it's like to be on the business end of an April Fool's joke, but all the thumb
    pianos and funky drumming that follow in the next six minutes don't make up for
    the cringe-worthiness that precedes.</p><p>
    
    Take heart, o reader, for the second record cures some of the injustices of the
    first.  ""Unmarked Boxes"" contains many of the same instruments mentioned above,
    but weaves the guitar strands together in a carefully echoing chorus.  This time
    the vocals comprise actual lyrics, which crest powerfully before fading into
    ""Telikos II,"" an instrumental elaboration.  The two brief pieces that follow,
    each titled with a symbol unrepresentable here, are some of the most fascinating
    on the album, juxtaposing an organ and building-block jam with television samples
    and the sound of a running faucet.  And the album ends with its one essential
    composition, ""An Egypt That Does Not Exist.""  The group blends their voices,
    singing, ""I die daily/ I lay down,"" a mantra that repeats over and over as the
    flute mourns concordantly.</p><p>
    
    Is there a contradiction?  One minute, I'm accusing Cerberus Shoal of taking
    themselves too seriously, the next they're just screwing around.  There are a
    few genuinely playful moments, as with the funky 70s bassline squonk on ""Stumblin'
    Block,"" but more often, the grooves on <i>Mr. Boy Dog</i> are a Barnum &amp; Bailey
    procession gone bad.  Improvisation taken to the most zany extremes of logic can
    so easily result in music that's focused on process and technique at the expense
    of being stimulating.  It's the Cerberus Shoal collective as cult, obsessed with
    ritual without the sacrament to make it meaningful.  Groups like the No-Neck Blues
    Band are doing similar, more intriguing things.  What's mystifying is that Cerberus
    Shoal seem incredibly satisfied with their current position, as if this is the
    peak they've always wanted to reach.  If so, then march on!  Their music will
    always be unique, but I can only imagine those dedicated to the weirdest tangents
    of rock to follow.  The average listener's question will be: ""What the hell are
    these guys on?!""</p></div>"|1382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1382-mr-boy-dog/|6.8|Christopher Dare

    house music since his wildpitch debut, <i>By Dawn's Early Light</i>. On that album,
    released under his alias Thee Maddkatt Courtship, and very much under the influence
    of his studio mentor, DJ Pierre, Felix took Pierre's multiply layered hypnotic
    grooves and added melancholic intimacy via his own soon-to-be-trademark heavily
    processed vocals and those of Harrison Crump, the Marvin Gaye of house music
    (right down to the unfortunate surname).</p><p>
    
    Felix's follow-up to the swirling electro-soul of his debut was the avant-techno
    funk of <i>Alone in the Dark</i> which blurred the distinctions Felix had made
    between his soulful work under the Thee Maddkatt Courtship name and the brooding
    vengeful techno of his Aphrohead work. Common to both, though, is Felix's unique
    skill at creating serene surfaces that conceal tremendous undertows beneath.</p><p>
    
    Despite receiving bouquets from critics and DJs alike, the public never took to
    these releases. Felix refused to compromise his vision or diminish the power of
    his music until 1999's <i>I Know Electrikboy</i>. With its fusion of <i>Controversy</i>-era
    Prince and <i>Dare</i>-period Human League, <i>I Know Electrikboy</i> laid out the
    blueprint for the current synth-pop/euroclash trend. With contributions from all
    his regulars, and with an especially sublime-sounding Harrison Crump, <i>I Know
    Electrikboy</i> is a remarkable play for both cash and kudos.</p><p>
    
    The same cannot be said for <i>Kittenz and Thee Glitz</i>, Felix's <i>Electrikboy</i>
    sequel. With guests drawn from outside of his usual circle, the record quickly
    becomes Felix's New Power Generation-equivalent. And just as NPG releases were
    unmistakably Prince-derived yet also Prince-diluted, so <i>Kittenz and Thee Glitz</i>
    is Housecat watered down by trivia and outside egos.</p><p>
<i>I Know Electrikboy</i> revolved thematically around Felix's love of music, and
    naturally, <i>Kittenz</i> has a concept, too (though it may not be as distinctly
    international this time around): the price of fame and the lack of superstar
    privacy (Naomi Campbell's precedent-setting victory against <i>The Daily Mirror</i>
    came too late for Felix to adjust his stance). The Italian rip-off James Bond
    cover of the Emperor Norton issue of the album loses the power of the European
    City Rockers cover which blankly replicated the paparazzi-sniper-lensed layout of
    celebrity magazine <i>Hello!</i>.  Felix and collaborator, Miss Kitten, are ""shot""
    perusing what indictingly resembles a Cheesecake Factory menu, getting to luxury
    cars with bimbettes, shopping for designer items-- a vapid parade of every
    superstar's humdrum daily routine.</p><p>
    
    Complimenting the artwork, the album is a humdrum collection, and hardly the stuff
    I expect from Felix. Nothing here comes to life like his previous mini-masterpieces
    ""My Life Muzik,"" ""Metropolis"" and ""Wet Wednesday.""  The limp ""Harlot"" opens the
    disc, thereby introducing Melistar to the world. Melistar rides a fuzzed bassline
    similar to Thomas Heckmann's ""Amphetamine"" and blankly mimics Miss Kittin's vacant
    delivery. The rigid funk of ""Walk With Me"" follows, dipping into the same fountain
    as ""My Life Muzik"" without ever taking its shoes off.</p><p>
    
    ""Pray for a Star"" is classic Harrison Crump, with an angelic, mournful voice tripping
    through minimal accompaniment. Felix has never failed to allow Crump all the space
    he needs within a song, and that rule applies here as it did nearly a decade ago.
    But it's such a pity that Felix grants Crump only two slots on the present album.
    Quite why he didn't reject Miss Kittin's contributions (""Voicemail,"" ""Madame
    Hollywood"" and ""Silver Screen - Shower Scene""), is uncertain, though it likely has
    something to do with a severe lapse of judgment.</p><p>
    
    Miss Kittin obviously saved her
    more charming performances for her albums with the Hacker (<i>First Album</i>) and
    fellow Swede, Goldenboy (<i>Or</i>). Felix applies the same hands-off technique to
    ""Madame Hollywood"" as he did to ""Pray for a Star"" but Kittin's dull-as-dishwater
    celebrity fantasies and irritatingly neutral delivery pale in comparison to how
    Harrison Crump performs in an identical environment. It's the difference between
    true talent and a plastic knock-off.</p><p>
    
    At least for ""Silver Screen - Shower Scene"" Felix breaks out a devastatingly
    massive club groove. The Godzilla bassline pounds hard enough it's actually
    easy to ignore Miss Kitten's twittering about nicotine and ""endless pleasures in
    limousines."" I read more intriguing fantasies in Dan Savage's ""Savage Love"" advice
    column on Thursdays.  But Oprah Winfrey in a career-destroying scat gangbang
    scenario is tough competition, so maybe we'll give her a break on this one.</p><p>
    
    For ""Control Freaq,"" Felix collaborates with Junior Sanchez to produce an
    all-stomping, all-tweaking but essentially dull Daft Punk sound-a-like. Melistar
    and Miss Kittin join together in blandness for the Level 42-does-jungle track
    ""What Does It Feel Like?""  At least Felix emulation of Visage's ""The Anvil"" during
    ""Happy Hour"" goes some way to redeem yet another one of Melistar's catalog of
    superstar room-service, chauffeur-driven things she must endure as such a major
    celebrity. The sad part is that none of this banging on about celebrity status
    has even the remotest whiff of parody or sarcasm about it. Can anyone imagine
    Felix and his crew writing screeds like V/VM's ""Hate You,"" whose proclamations
    actually change minds about our media-whore society?</p><p>
    
    Well, regardless, however much of a disappointment the majority of <i>Kittenz and
    Thee Glitz</i> has come to me, I can't lose faith in Felix. Closing the album with
    ""Runaway Dreamer"" and Harrison Crump at his most charmingly dolorous, I know that
    whatever Felix does these days, he'll never lose my admiration for his previous
    truly stellar achievements.  With any luck, <i>Kittenz and Thee Glitz</i> will
    bring him such fame and notoriety that the dire exhaustion of it all forces him
    into seclusion.  There he could return to his true calling: creating poignant dance
    music without equal.</p></div>"|3029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3029-kittenz-and-thee-glitz/|4.2|Paul Cooper

Monorail!  Monorail!  I just can't say this band's name without thinking
    of that classic musical number from ""The Simpsons,"" led by the late Phil Hartman's
    delightfully shady salesman Lyle Lanley.  Naturally, in true Simpsons fashion,
    nothing regarding Springfield's short-lived foray into the world of efficient mass
    transportation goes well, and the town ends up with yet another big, useless folly
    to put next to the tire fire, the popsicle stick skyscraper and the escalator to
    nowhere.  Thankfully, this Louisville, Kentucky quartet's debut album is pretty
    much the exact opposite of Springfield, USA's monorail-- not only is it
    well-structured, but it even delivers its hooks on time.</p><p>
    
    Though in fact a rock album recorded for an indie label, <i>Essex</i> is not a
    wholly typical indie rock album.  First of all, it opens with a sound collage of
    disembodied drum fills and voices recorded in varying states of lo-finess called
    ""Regularize.""  While this in and of itself is not especially revolutionary, it's
    the fact that the band doesn't shy away from using similar tactics to spice up the
    batch of songs they've cooked up to fill the rest of the album that truly
    impresses.</p><p>
    
    ""It's Hard to Keep Things Clean"" kicks off at the end of ""Regularize"" with pounding
    drums and chugging rhythms to support the slightly off-kilter melody.  Though his
    phrasing gets better as the album wears on, it's already apparent here that vocalist
    Tom Cantrell has a strong set of pipes.  But it's not really until the album's
    centerpiece, the spacy ""Valley of Green Lights,"" that his potential as a singer
    really becomes apparent.  Over what could best be described as a clean shoegazer
    backing, his voice just soars, tackling lyrics about all manner of little
    mundanities that color small town life, from the guy on the ""rumbling crotch
    rocket Honda"" waiting for the light to change to the bowling league meeting every
    Thursday.  The iridescent keyboards in the background fit appropriately with the
    title, effectively conjuring the artificial lights of the modern world.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""Master Plan"" takes a fairly conventional song chassis with programmed
    beats and grafts live drum fills onto it, bringing Charles A. Bailey II's solid
    drumming into the forefront of the mix.  Bailey also plays a rhythmic foil to the
    drum machine, battling its steady pulse with syncopated playing and intentionally
    moving out of synch with it at the song's conclusion.  Meanwhile, on top of this,
    there's a pretty interesting song happening.  Marc Linquist's synths squeal like
    mad and the simplicity of Cantrell's melody is subverted by the crazy dub going
    on behind it.  It's remarkable that such a young band manages to pull off a song
    like this without derailing.  Er, thank you.  I'll be here all week.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the album's finest song, though, is ""Kentucky Morning,"" a slow-burning
    anthem laced with feedback-drenched guitars that pour into every crack of the
    song, but never overtake the vocals.  In fact, considering how much sound there
    is packed into the song, it's amazing how clear the mix is-- importantly, the
    emphasis is on restraint and texture, not visceral response.  This is followed
    by ""Hummingbird,"" with booming drums that would sound nice and cozy on a Flaming
    Lips record and floating electric piano lines that help propel the harmony.  The
    song builds to tense, synth-soaked climaxes in each chorus, which highlights just
    how fluid the verse rhythm is.</p><p>
    
    The band rounds out their sound with a few more straightforward rock songs, like
    ""Padre,"" ""Arcane,"" and the bounding closer ""With Your Eyes Closed.""  ""Padre""
    boasts a particularly catchy chorus and some sterling lead guitar work.  Even
    these songs exhibit as certain flair for what Cantrell terms ""sonic parlor
    tricks,"" though, as found in the phased drums that open ""Padre,"" or the way John
    Poole's catchy bass hook bursts forward in the mix between lines in ""With Your
    Eyes Closed.""</p><p>
    
    Monorail seem to constantly strive to give their songs an edge of experimentation
    when they could just as easily leave them for what they are and get by.  It stands
    to reason that the occasional melodic wrinkle that pops up here should be fairly
    well ironed out by their next effort, which I'll be looking forward to.  So now
    comes the part of this job that I like perhaps more than any other: the part where
    I recommend an utterly worthy record that might not have otherwise crossed your
    path.  If we know what's good for us, mass transportation will be the wave of the
    future.  Be the first one on your block to check out the monorail.</p></div>"|5406.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5406-essex/|8.0|Joe Tangari

    politics of elementary school. A scary notion, considering the rationale of any
    ne'er-to-do Kindergartner whose top priorities are dictated by ""The Pokémon
    Trading Card Guidebook."" Which brings us to the most obvious reflection of human
    fallibility: the desire to be popular. One should note that it's during the
    infancy of our formal education when we first become the unassuming targets of
    manipulative marketers who would have us believe that their product ensures our
    acceptance on the playground (and will, through some magic turn of events, make
    Daddy stop yelling at Mommy). Unfortunately, such misemployments of our naïveté
    work all too well, occasionally giving birth to a ""cult-fad"" or ""cultural
    phenomenon.""</p><p>
    It goes without saying, though, that once a formula for success has been
    established, the wave of would-be imitators held back by their own unimaginative
    nature champion it as their own, flooding the market with unabashedly derivative
    commodities far more economically priced than their brand-name counterparts. It
    was strange how on the heels of Pokémon's success, the similarly themed ""Digimon""
    made it to American airwaves. Such was the case with the ""Snorks,"" Hanna-Barbera's
    ill-conceived reaction to the wildly popular success of the Smurfs (albeit, with
    less communist rhetoric and subtext).</p><p>
    Now, in the more utilitarian aspects of life, I fall into the pro-genericism camp.
    Being thrifty, I've found that an RC Cola is much less of a strain on your pocketbook
    than Coke, and just as refreshing. But I bring this up because, a few weeks ago, a
    good friend of mine who's had to endure my incessant praise of the Elephant 6
    collective for years on end approached me with the Arthurs' debut album and tried
    to pass it off as the second coming Christ (i.e. the Beatles). I listened
    attentively to the record's first few moments, which boasted a chorus of decidedly
    off-key children singing, ""Please don't take my sunshine away,"" before my attention
    was diverted to the far more pressing issue of who would win in a hypothetical
    fight: Jeff Magnum or the tag-team of Will Cullen Hart and Bill Doss.</p><p>
    It's unfortunate that the Arthurs and I got off on such a bad foot because, for
    what it's worth, they're not really a ""bad"" band. As with any semi-lucrative
    psychedelic pop album, <i>Walking in the Sunlight</i> has its fair share of sharp
    hooks, hummable melodies, and Liverpudlian meanderings. But these ingredients
    alone do not insure an intriguing alchemy. In fact, it's when these structural
    cornerstones are prized over good ol' fashioned experimentation (the very source
    of psychedelia) that one is faced with such middle-of-the-road""</p></div>"|304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/304-walking-in-the-sunlight/|6.2|Kevin Adickes

I'm not hip on the current lingo, so I'm not
    positive, but I'm pretty sure that's what they call it.  I do know that I have a
    friend named Eric, and a few years ago Eric said to me, ""Your rock and roll music
    has too many words.""  It took me a long time to see what he meant, but had I heard
    Ocelot when he first muttered the immortal phrase, I would've gotten it right away.
    The man's no fool.</p><p>
    
    Atlanta four-piece Ocelot's sophomore release, <i>The Quiet Storm</i> is a very aptly
    titled instrumental rock record.  Robotic rhythms back layers of guitar which flutter
    between lush and discordant while basslines pummel your ears with their density.
    The album opens and closes with quiet ambient tracks (""Empathy and Projection""
    and ""The Quiet Storm,"" respectively), but sandwiched in between, there's hardly
    a chance to breathe.  The majority of the tracks alternate between tight rhythms
    and raucous, frenetic moments that can be described no way other than chaotic.
    ""Loss Prevention Officer"" is a prime example, its repetitive riffs giving way to
    feverish bouts of sheer intensity.</p><p>
    
    ""Throwing Away a Perfectly Good White Boy,"" copping its title none-too-subtly from
    the John Cusack classic <i>Better Off Dead</i>, is much more subdued, showing
    Ocelot's ability to siphon emotions other than anger into their instruments.  The
    layered guitar and bass are wonderfully arranged, and leave little room for
    distraction.  And just when you think it's safe to get comfortable with the more
    relaxed mood of ""White Boy,"" they tear into the gravely vicious ""Is It a Drug, a
    Virus, or Religion?"" which changes so frequently that you're never quite sure
    where it's headed, or if it even gets there.</p><p>
    
    Bryan Harris' smooth bass playing leads you through ""Things with Molecular
    Structure"" like a slow, peaceful jaunt through a smoke-filled bar at closing
    time, proving once and for all that the lead guitar doesn't always have to be
    the star of the show.  The real monster lurking under the bed, though, is ""Tear
    You Down Build Me Up.""  It opens with a single guitar riff that sounds like it
    could be the intro to a slow metal song-- but don't let that fool you.  At exactly
    33 seconds in, the floodgates come crashing open, and it's tough to figure out
    who in the band is kicking the most ass.  The drums are a flurry of hi-hat and
    snare drum, the bass is a jumble of rapid-fire notes, and one guitar lays down a
    dense fog of noisy chords while another squeals over it all.  It's a lot to take
    in, but the result is staggering.  You have been warned.</p><p>
    
    The other true standout track is ""A Principle or a Butterfly,"" which features
    drummer Mackenzie Cole pounding a mechanical beat that is hypnotically cyclical.
    In the end, all of the instruments fall away except the drums, which continue to
    pound.  After a moment, a second drummer (!) kicks in, and the levels slowly
    increase until you're sure that either your speakers or your goddamned eardrums
    are going to burst-- and then everything stops suddenly, almost as if your
    stereo just gave up the fight.</p><p>
    
    Christ, who needs vocals, anyway?  In Ocelot's case, a singer would only get in
    the way and distract us all from the musicians and their true talents.  The songs
    on <i>The Quiet Storm</i> take me back to a time when I first discovered indie
    rock with bands like Unwound and Car vs. Driver.  And much like those bands,
    Ocelot's ability to display a wide range of emotion is a true testament to the
    shocking power of sound.</p></div>"|5939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5939-the-quiet-storm/|7.8|Cory Byrom

Anything
    with an acoustic guitar, too-closely-miked vocals, and lyrics about relationships
    can garner acclaim as ""deeply personal,"" ""moving,"" and ""profound""-- even when it's
    about as intimate and deep as a fucking Hallmark card.  Sorry, but a trite,
    unimaginative confession has nothing to do with intimacy. The most intimate depths
    of the human mind-- even the mind of an obnoxious midwestern singer/songwriter--
    are inhabited by things far more interesting than three chords and a little reverb.
    The human mind is a place of imagination-- grandiose dreams, nagging fears,
    perplexing memories, and a batch of other insanely complicated thoughts and
    emotions. Expressing something so complex through music is not at all easy. Doing
    it in a way that's consistently interesting-- and without ever edging towards
    self-indulgent experimentation-- is a serious accomplishment.</p><p>
    Phil Elvrum, the sonic genius behind the Microphones, has made a name for himself
    making records that are both personal and incredibly inventive. But while Elvrum's
    music focuses largely on his role in nature, Mirah's second Elvrum-produced album,
    <i>Advisory Committee</i>, is a more purely introspective affair.</p><p>
    What sets <i>Advisory Committee</i> apart from these kinds of records is that,
    while it does address age-old album fodder like romance and heartbreak, it does
    so in a way that's both accessible and interesting. Many of the things said on
    <i>Advisory Committee</i> have been said before, but Mirah says them with a potent
    combination of sincerity, wit, and innocence.</p><p>
    The centerpiece of <i>Advisory Committee</i> is ""Cold Cold Water,"" a piece of
    romantic fantasy that sounds every bit as dramatic and beautiful as the sentiments
    it expresses. ""Cold Cold Water,"" with its lonely, Morricone-influenced desert
    twang, its passionate, icy strings and its innovative, varied percussion, is
    nothing short of a masterpiece, fully deserving the in-depth treatment it received
    on the EP that bears its name.  The spooky, windy echoes, and powerful, resonating
    xylophone of ""Special Death"" is another highlight, with a guitar and melody that
    vaguely evoke late-90s Radiohead. ""Make It Hot"" sports one of the most compelling
    arrangements on <i>Advisory Committee</i>, opening with just acoustic guitar and
    Mirah's lovely, girlish voice singing what could be the album's second-strongest
    melody, behind the unfuckwithable ""Cold Cold Water."" The next track, ""Mt. St.
    Helens,"" would feel right at home on a Microphones record, with plucked acoustic
    guitars, nature-centered lyrics, and Elvrum's trademark thundering percussion.</p><p>
    Perhaps the only major complaint that can be levied against <i>Advisory Committee</i>
    is that, when Mirah attempts quasi-operatics, it comes across as borderline
    ridiculous.  Still, this is a vast improvement, considering that 2000's <i>You
    Think It's Like This But Really It's Like This</i> was brutally cloying throughout.
    <i>Advisory Committee</i> rarely falls into that trap.  Here, Mirah is rarely
    interested in sounding precious, and instead adapts a more mature vocal style
    whose confidence reflects more Björk than Juliana Hatfield.</p><p>
    Of course, ""maturity""-- like ""intimacy"" and ""introspection""-- is a word that far
    too often translates to ""suck.""  In fact, all of these words have been used and
    abused to the point where they don't mean much of anything anymore. And that's
    what's so great about <i>Advisory Committee</i>-- when you strip down these
    adjectives to their purest meaning, they actually do a pretty damned good job of
    describing the music.  Imagine that!</p></div>"|5329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5329-advisory-committee/|8.3|Matt LeMay

    interesting way to break their new single: this past fall, ""Moment in the Sun""
    became the new theme song for NBC's ""Ed,"" after the show lost the rights to the
    Foo Fighters' ""Next Year.""  Eef Barzelay's nasal croon has replaced Dave Grohl's
    pretty boy vocals, and Clem Snide gets to put themselves in front of 9.4 million
    Americans every Wednesday night.</p><p>
    
    ""Moment in the Sun"" was a left-field choice for the biggest television network in
    America, but there is some synergy between Clem Snide and the show: ""Ed,"" which is
    executive produced by David Letterman, is a comedy about life and love in a small
    town, with a romantic storyline and plenty of subplots about the wacky locals and
    their goofy schemes.  Ed is ""quirky""-- in other words, non-threatening, mildly
    funny and dismissable.  Detractors of Clem Snide accuse the band of the same flaws:
    Eef Barzelay's songs dare you not to take them too seriously, as they use clever
    wordplay (""Joan Jett of Arc""), picturesque settings (""Dairy Queen""), and most
    damning of all, pop culture references to drive that home.</p><p>
    
    The listener has to pay closer attention to see how these lighter elements front
    serious statements.  ""Moment in the Sun"" is a bright, euphoric song: from the
    easygoing guitar line that opens it, to the horn fanfare and big finish, it tries
    to make you feel good.  And yet Barzelay's lyrics are sardonic, making fun of
    empty-headed do-gooders: ""I think that hunger, war and death are bringing everybody
    down,"" he sings, mocking the hippie types who don't understand why everything has
    to be so hard.</p><p>
    
    Barzelay claims to have written it about that pop yodeler-turned-poetess, Jewel,
    but he turns it around yet again.  As he imitates what he's making fun of, he sings
    with uncommon gusto.  ""When it's my moment in the sun/ Oh, how beautiful I'll be,""
    he belts with conviction, and you wonder if he isn't making fun of himself-- and
    if he is, why he's enjoying it so much.</p><p>
    
    The EP includes two versions of the single: the album version, and a shorter, less
    effective radio edit that fades out before the big finish.  The other reissued
    material is a remix of ""Your Favorite Music,"" from their album of the same name.
    Master Cylinder and the Fruit Key give the song a plusher synth background and
    some cheesy sax fills; it adds some bounce to the melody, though it doesn't
    surpass the simpler, gorgeous original.</p><p>
    
    There are also three new tracks, all solo recordings by Barzelay: two with acoustic
    guitar, and one that adds keyboards and a drum machine.  ""Now the Moment's Gone"" is
    unexpectedly vicious: he bears down on his guitar and turns the chorus into an
    unfettered sneer.  Even the jokes-- ""Now the costume party's ended/ Will the ghost
    return your call?""-- make the song meaner instead of lighter.  On ""I Believe Your
    Lies,"" he sings the line in the title but trails off to indicate how conditional
    the statement is; his voice conveys a guarded vulnerability.  ""Do You Love Me"" may
    be one of his least enjoyable songs, but only because it's so honest: he whines
    through the verse, asking a girl if she loves him or hates him but implying that
    their relationship has just gone stale.  These songs are more direct and raw than
    his earlier solo features.  And as always, he wraps his sentiments in ambiguity
    and good lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Clem Snide's appearance on ""Ed"" has yet to turn them into America's New Sweethearts.
    Though they've probably won new fans, many of the show's viewers have been turned
    off by the new song: the ""Ed"" fan sites are full of attacks, listing all of the
    animals you could strangle that would sound like Barzelay.  Even Snide fans could
    admit that Barzelay's voice is not commonly beautiful, but the real problem may be
    that his vocals are challenging and complicated: they're definitely too interesting
    for a TV theme song.  Clem Snide may seem idiosyncratic, but they know how to
    transcend that to create something meaningful-- and this slim EP, a memento of
    their first brief moment of nationwide fame, proves it as powerfully as any of
    their albums.</p></div>"|1500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1500-moment-in-the-sun-ep/|7.5|Chris Dahlen

    insects: the Walkmen have been on MTV all week, and the <i>Village Voice</i> has
    instructed me to consider them my ""favorite new band.""  Formed two years ago with
    members of Jonathan Fire*eater and the Recoys, they already sound like they've
    been making the rounds for years and are eyeing some arena dates.  In fact, they're
    thinking so big that they're already worried that Sony could sue them over their
    bandname.</p><p>
    And I don't see anything wrong with that.  It's actually refreshing to hear a new
    band that seems so confident.  It's not that they sound commercial-- yet-- but that
    they remind us that ""pop"" stands for popular.  From the start of <i>Everyone Who
    Pretended to Like Me Is Gone</i>, their first full-length, they aim high: the two
    minute warm-up of ""They're Winning"" comes throbbing from the ether like a machine
    revving to life; and on ""Warm Up"" that machine is taking bold strides-- the guitar
    attack, the brutish drums, and Hamilton Leithauser's showmanlike vocals rage
    in unison.  Leithauser is being compared to other rock vocalists, and as one
    reference point, he sounds like Bono: he veers to the high end of his range and
    he's not afraid to make every note sound important.  But more crucially, he's a
    true frontman.  He's remarkably self-assured and you can hear his exertion,
    particularly on the potential single, ""We've Been Had.""</p><p>
    The Walkmen record in their own studio, Marcata Recording, and they've nailed
    their sound: <i>Everyone Who Pretended</i> is a pleasure to listen to, a visceral
    recording with a large soundscape.  The palette is also nicely limited: the
    atmospheric sweeps come from many sources but they have a consistent feel, and
    the most prominent sounds are the basic drums, bass and guitar that anchor each
    track.  The Walkmen have one innovative texture: an upright piano that's recorded
    with a warbly, slightly distant sound, like small rocks knocking against each
    other in the sea.  It sounds so neat that Paul Maroon can just idly twinkle out
    notes, like the plinks that dot ""Revenge Wears No Wristwatch.""  Its texture even
    dominates the quiet ""Stop Talking"" and the creepy introduction to ""Roll Down
    the Line,"" and it carries the pretty, rolling melody of ""The Blizzard of '96.""</p><p>
    The piano helps create their signature sound without becoming a distraction, and
    also, it's just nice to hear a band use stark arrangements-- for example, the album
    closer, ""I'm Never Bored,"" starts with just drums and vocals until Maroon and
    Leithauser layer in the piercing and grinding guitars.  These guys play quietly
    and simply enough that when they pile on the sound, well... it's pretty damn
    magnificent.</p><p>
    The songwriting on <i>Everyone Who Pretended</i> is solid, but it's the title
    track that really impresses.  It harkens back to bands like U2 or the Cure-- not
    just in tone, but in magnitude: skyscraping guitar smears and then a striking riff,
    the texture taking flight, and Leithauser insinuating his vocals on top, never
    weighing down a song that's already soaring.  The only complaint you could make
    is that it's too short-- that, in under four minutes, they play a song that sounds
    like it should go on for eight or nine, with big video screens looming behind and
    Leithauser doing something filthy to the mike stand.</p><p>
    Remember when U2 was younger and hungrier, and Bono could sing about ""the desert
    sky"" so boldly that you could picture it?  It's rare today to hear a rock band
    think that way.  This is why the Walkmen deserve attention.  There must be some
    way to make the kids rebellious and excited about the things of this earth,
    and when I hear a song as vast and propulsive as this one, it gives me hope.</p></div>"|8571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8571-everyone-who-pretended-to-like-me-is-gone/|8.7|Chris Dahlen

    Tibet sure does have a lot of friends. Since the dawn of the whole British-Industrial-Experimental-Noise-Collage
    scene close to thirty years ago, Tibet has played with everyone from Death in June
    to 23 Skidoo to Psychic TV. Perhaps most notable, though, are his frequent
    collaborations with Steven Stapleton (aka Nurse With Wound), arguably one of the
    most important noise artists of the 20th century and-- without a doubt-- one of
    the most prolific. Throughout the years, Stapleton and Tibet have worked together
    countless times, yet it took a near death experience to bring them together for
    a double-billing.</p><p>
    Built by Stapleton and Tibet around lyrics written by the latter
    while in a hospital, recovering from a near fatal bout with appendicitis (complete,
    it would seem, with hallucinations of angels of death), <i>Bright Yellow Moon</i>
    is the first official collaborative record between Nurse With Wound and Current 93.
    Given the two fine musicians at the helm, and given such a vivid experience to
    draw from, one would assume <i>Bright Yellow Moon</i> to be a shocking look at
    human mortality-- already a recurring theme in Tibet's work. The results, however,
    are decidedly hit or miss.</p><p>
    There are a few great moments like this on <i>Bright Yellow Moon</i>. Unfortunately,
    they're all sandwiched between often thick slabs of Tibet's so-called ""apocalyptic
    folk"" and chunks of go-nowhere filler.  ""Disintegrate Blur 36 Page 03"" is little
    more than aimless keyboard tones accompanied by cymbal crashes, kind of like the
    ones scattered throughout <i>Homotopy to Marie</i>, but without any of the creeping
    tension that made that record so stark and twisted. It drags on for nearly ten
    minutes, before it gives way to overly dramatized spoken word that ultimately goes
    nowhere.  Tibet is accompanied by a computer-voice (which I can best describe as the
    British cousin of Conan O'Brian's Pimpbot 5000) repeating the mantra, ""Your time is
    mine.""  I guess this is Tibet's (perhaps characteristically odd) way of trying to
    communicate the feelings of helplessness which came with the unexpected onset of
    a potentially fatal disease.</p><p>
    On the next track, though, his music hits this mark with far greater accuracy than
    do his words.  ""Mothering Sunday (Legion Legion)"" is an astonishing sound collage,
    glorious in its complexity. As a vocal sample from an old folk song and field
    recordings of a train are drowned out by a burst of noise (imagine a giant
    furnace spitting flames), the listener can imagine that this is what Tibet
    experienced as he lost consciousness in that hospital, only dimly aware of his
    life slipping from his hands. Simple, static tones resonate behind waves of sheer
    droning sound, each shifting in and out while, off in the distance, a saxophone
    squeals away madly.  Or is it the horn of the train, the sound of its wheels still
    haunting your memory?</p><p>
    Eventually, the chaos gives way to near silence. A few
    plaintive synth tones and an apathetic, arrhythmic clicking appear, tentatively
    padding the void, while occasional echoes-- garbled human voice, Berio-style tape
    manipulations, chopped up bits of distant radio-- cut through. Effected sounds
    resonate; loops appear and disappear. Sounds linger just loud enough so that you
    can hear them, but just quiet enough that you can't make them out. Over the course
    of twenty minutes or so, Tibet and Stapleton watch their world destroyed, and then
    rebuild it to the best of their ability.</p><p>
    This is a piece that stands with the best
    of either artist's material-- merging the dramatic sensibilities of noise units
    like SPK and Throbbing Gristle with the musique concrète techniques perfected by
    artists like Cage and Xenakis.  It's a lot like both groups' earlier works-- in
    fact, the hit-or-miss acoustic poeticism and the simplistic drum machines that
    have infected their most recent offerings is nowhere to be found.</p><p>
    ""Mothering Sunday"" is followed by ""Nichts,"" a painfully boring acoustic piece.
    David strums his guitar, and sings/speaks aimlessly with an admittedly fragile
    voice about insistent cuckoos, silent children, drowsing poppies, sunny fields,
    walking like shadows, and lots of other uncharacteristically romantic schlock.
    ""I lose myself/ And dream of worlds/ That lie between/ Your fingers,"" he tells us
    at one point, in a stylistically dead British swagger. ""And hide behind/ Your eyes/
    And dream of forests/ And forts of snow/ Where we may kneel/ And hold each other/
    In our still young arms/ Till the moon goes out."" Though such aimless poeticism
    was no doubt a crucial part of Tibet's healing process, the decision to share it
    with his listeners is questionable, especially when one considers the hefty price
    tags on your average limited-edition World Serpent record ($34.99's the price tag
    on this one).</p><p>
    Tibet occasionally tosses off a fine couplet while pondering the relevance of time
    or the futility of human existence.  Unfortunately, these occasional insights about
    mortality only serve to remind the listener of his time being wasted when they're
    followed up by lines like, ""When the snake is dead, they put roses in their head/
    When the roses die, they put diamonds in their eye.""</p><p>
    ""Die, Flip, or Go to India"" is difficult in a different way. An instrumental bridge
    between a long folk number and the album's closing (and admittedly stunning) collage,
    it does little more than reprise the dullest parts of ""Disintegrate Blur."" It seems
    obvious that Stapleton and Tibet intend these aurally plain segments to contrast
    the chaos of the record's noisier portions.  Sadly, they succeed at little more
    than boring people to sleep. At times, <i>Bright Yellow Moon</i> is quite stunning,
    but it drags on far longer than necessary, placing it firmly into the ""less-than-the-sum-of-its-parts""
    category. Tibet and Stapleton are both fine musicians with excessively large back
    catalogs, much of which is far more consistent than this. All but the most fervent
    industrialists would do well to look elsewhere for their fix of either artist.
    <i>Bright Yellow Moon</i>, despite its moments, just isn't worth it-- especially
    given that whole human mortality thing.</p></div>"|5868.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5868-bright-yellow-moon/|6.2|David M. Pecoraro

Come on, I know there must be more than
    a few.  I was certainly intimidated reading about people like Pharaoh Sanders and
    Albert Ayler when I was growing up, just a young, naïve Beatle freak.  The way the
    writers spoke of these men and their incendiary, transcendent music; the way it
    seemed I was expected to have done about 40 years of jazz preparation before I
    could really appreciate the music at hand-- it was all too much for me, until the
    day I actually discovered the music.</p><p>
    The thing is, when I actually heard some of it (I believe my first exposure was
    via Coltrane's <i>Ascension</i> LP, which I'd borrowed from my school music library),
    I was shocked to find out how ""normal"" it was.  That is, normal in the sense of
    not being the alien, restricted music I had mentally formulated from so much
    reading.  Coltrane's band wasn't playing ""heads,"" that's for sure, but the sounds
    did seem to make sense, as if I was listening in on some kind of brainstorming
    session of geniuses.  When I really let my guard down, I swear I heard conversations
    and hundreds of details passing from player to player-- in a way, it was still too
    much for a neophyte to comprehend, but in a good way.  As it turns out, the free
    jazz on that record was actually some of the more chaotic (though certainly not
    unstructured) I've heard, and in fact, I've become so accustomed to the
    conversational and brainstorming nature of the music that sometimes I don't even
    register that it's happening.</p><p>
    Case in point: Elton Dean and Mark Hewins' duo release, <i>Bar Torque</i>. The
    music contained on this disc (from a 1992 performance) can often seem like
    atmospheric mood music-- the kind you hear in the background of made-for-Cinemax
    flicks and the tenser moments of ""Law &amp; Order.""  Other times, the two Englishmen
    conjure up spooky, post-<i>In a Silent Way</i> impressionism, where moments later
    they'll venture into unabashedly new age textures.  At no point does this record
    ever become the ""incendiary"" skronk-fest I thought I was reading about all those
    years ago.  And yet, this is free jazz in the purest sense of the term: unrehearsed,
    unedited musical communication and invention.  And there's nothing scary about that.</p><p>
    Saxophonist Elton Dean (yes, Elton John really did steal his name from this guy)
    has been pushing the boundaries of improvisation in a rock setting for over thirty
    years, most notably with the Canterbury outfit, Soft Machine.  He appeared on
    their first three albums, as well as working with like-minded musicians Hugh
    Hopper, Keith Tippett, Roswell Rudd and Tony Levin.  He plays with a lyrical style
    not obviously akin to the hard, expressive styles of Sanders and Coltrane, but
    just as willing to explore any number of harmonic avenues.  With over twenty albums
    as a leader, he's easily the more well known of the duo.</p><p>
    Guitarist Mark Hewins has worked with many of the same people Dean has, though
    generally as a sideman or backing musician rather than a featured player.  He
    filters his guitar through MIDI devices on this record to such an extent that it's
    sometimes hard to tell whether there's even a guitar in the mix.  Occasionally, he
    pulls out his acoustic for more familiar sonorities, but for the most part, his
    role on <i>Bar Torque</i> seems that of lush harmonic pallet to Dean's soft,
    watercolor brushstroke.</p><p>
    The title track is an epic (just under 25 minutes) display of extended impressionism.
    It begins with distant motives from Dean, echoing over the ominous, almost growling
    deal note from Hewins.  What sounds like celesta notes reverberating even further
    back than Dean's figures initiates the movement of the piece.  I won't lie: if you
    turned the volume down a bit and walked away, this might be mistaken for serious
    background music.  Hewins adds a touch of Iberian-flavored acoustic, though I still
    have the feeling this is an enormous prelude to something, rather than a firm
    statement of the here and now.  Several minutes into the track, Hewins opts for
    more traditional guitar figures, though his MIDI effects surround everything with
    a warm, almost choral ambience.  Meanwhile, Dean is content to jump around the
    backdrop like a restless fly circling a dim lantern.  It's actually quite a
    relaxing mix (especially when Hewins' guitar imitates church bells), if a tad on
    the passive side for anyone looking for kinetic interaction.</p><p>
    ""Sylvan"" begins with some processed guitar feedback, and yet flighty saxophone
    motives.  Dean will sometimes lapse into figures that sound very close to
    traditional melodies, and occasionally, Hewins will even provide chordal
    accompaniment to the point where you might think they're actually playing a
    ""song.""  This, of course, is always short-lived, as the players opt out for
    sheer weightlessness, which often results in frustratingly indistinct soundscape.
    Sometimes, though, Dean and Hewins inject just enough dissonance to make their
    relatively small peaks and valleys seem larger.</p><p>
    Taken as a whole, <i>Bar Torque</i> can be an impressive display of free jazz at
    its most fluid and familiar.  However, despite the high level of musicianship in
    evidence, I could use more of that ""incendiary transcendence.""</p></div>"|2223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2223-bar-torque/|6.0|Dominique Leone

    instrumental music that has a canny sense of tension and release, and knows when
    to build and when to recede.  Mostly, though, it's music that doesn't put any
    pressure on you like the rest of your day does.  Coming home from a crap day of
    work or school or running errands or whatever it is you do, this is absolutely
    perfect music to put on and space out to.  In certain ways, it fits Brian Eno's
    definition of ambient perfectly-- you can put it on let it color the mood of a
    room, or you can sit attentively and listen; the music doesn't care.  In short,
    it's easy to relax to, and yet still maintains an air of intelligence.</p><p>
    
    Despite having four action verbs in their name, Do Make Say Think never really
    seem to be in a hurry to get anywhere.  Their music unfolds at a leisurely pace
    (those weaned exclusively on shorter-form music may even find it a bit boring),
    and often even fails to really arrive at a logically perceived destination,
    instead choosing to take a little side path that the musicians find more
    interesting.  The result is a highly unpredictable album of constantly shifting
    textures that feels fresh even after several listens in a row.</p><p>
    
    The Toronto five-piece actually opens the album with some of its most taut music,
    building ""Classic Noodlanding"" like a gathering storm for a full two minutes over
    fervently tapped cymbals.  Then, at the two-minute mark, drummers James Payment
    and Dave Mitchell burst into a rock groove, setting the other instruments free.
    Guitars and horns mingle on the buoyant undercurrent, and by the song's end, the
    band sounds almost ebullient.</p><p>
    
    ""End of Music"" benefits from a similar change in propulsion at its midpoint, moving
    from a slow, keyboard-dominated crawl to an open gallop, with guitars blazing in
    the foreground.  The dual drums augment each other quite unselfishly and prove one
    of the band's best assets.  ""White Light Of"" contains yet another amazing drum
    part, this time supporting bassist/trumpeter Charles Spearin and guest Brian
    Cram's deft horn arrangement and minimal melody.  This finally breaks down into a
    wet scape of sparsely strummed, tremeloed guitars recalling Bark Psychosis' ""Scum""
    or Talk Talk's ""Myrrhman.""</p><p>
    
    Those guitars return for the album's finest track, the transcendent ""Reitschule.""
    Wandering guitar melodies criss-cross each other before the drums enter on an
    unexpected beat.  Distorted guitars pile up on top of it all until a final, brief
    buildup, which opens into a dubby passage with a bassline Doug McCombs would be
    proud to call his own.  The process is repeated, this time with horns providing
    counterpoint to the urgently strummed guitars.  The breakdown after the second
    climax leaves the bass alone with a sparse, clean guitar for accompaniment before
    a yearning trumpet line enters.  Instruments are slowly added, and the process
    again repeats, each time following a different permutation on a similar concept.</p><p>
    
    The album's other three tracks offer further variations on the band's basic sound,
    from the muted tones and almost Hood-like pulse of ""Chinatown"" to guest Tamara
    Wlliamson's stirring wordless vocal contributions to the aptly titled ""Soul and
    Onward.""  Closer ""Anything for Now"" features some beautifully interwoven guitar
    and organ over a downright breezy undercarriage, before flattening out into a
    warm drone.  The album concludes with skittering dub guitars swelling over muted
    static-- the type of ambient texture that you can immerse yourself in fully.</p><p>
    
    If you haven't achieved full decompression by that point, you must be incredibly
    high strung.  <i>&amp; Yet &amp; Yet</i> proves to be Do Make Say Think's most fluid and
    satisfying album yet, masterfully conscripting the slow-burning dub of their 1998
    self-titled debut to the service of the jazz-inflected textures of 2000's <i>Goodbye
    Enemy Airship, the Landlord Is Dead</i>.  God only knows what the future holds for
    this band, but if their current direction is any indication, things are looking
    glaringly bright.</p></div>"|2399.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2399-yet-yet/|8.1|Joe Tangari

    And I don't mean sensitive as in ""fey,"" where the singer's every emotion curls up
    into a little ball.  Nicolai Dunger is a hunky Swede who's made many a crowd of
    Scandi-boppers melt into puddles, and his latest album, <i>Soul Rush</i>, is
    big-time, unabashed pop.  It's the sound of the first week of spring, of kids
    flying kites and playing doctor.  This is an album you can throw on at a barbecue
    when you're flipping bratwursts and drinking cheap beer, and the cutest girl or
    bulkiest Abercrombie &amp; Finch model will walk up and say, ""Hey, when did Van
    Morrison put out a new record?""</p><p>
    Yes, he sounds like Van Morrison, though his voice is deeper and more guttural.
    He chews every word like an inch-thick steak, and he slurs the lines so much that
    he almost sounds intoxicated-- until you realize that every note is right where
    he wants it.  The country-like opener, ""I'd Rather Die,"" starts clean and simple,
    giving you a chance to get used to the voice; the tune is pretty, and the acoustic
    guitar appropriates the signature hook of ""Stand by Your Man.""  And then, at the
    chorus, something just lets go: the steel pedal and organ swell, Magnus Ostrom
    starts bashing the drums with the lightest heavy touch-- and Dunger's voice soars
    while simultaneously digging ruts in the ground.</p><p>
    Dunger's earlier albums were more austere, and sometimes experimental; in the past
    he's even worked with folks like Robert Fripp.  But it's not a slight to say that
    this album is easy on the ears, and his experience shows not through any sense of
    adventure but through good taste and craftsmanship.  ""Dr. Zhivago's Train"" spins
    on a catchy guitar riff, trainlike drums and blasts of horns, underscored by weird
    electronic noodling-- all sweeping around a killer chorus, with the most convincing
    ""oooh-oooh-oooh"" to come from a blue-eyed soul singer in years.</p><p>
    Björn Yttling's arrangements are impeccable but organic, swelling out of nowhere
    but hitting with just enough power-- for example, the horn section on ""Ballad of
    a Relationship,"" offering fitting accompaniment for Dunger's ruminations.  The
    piano and violin on ""Return of Love"" contribute to a song that's more kicky than
    blue-- imagine a drunk Randy Newman singing the theme from <i>Toy Story</i>-- yet
    even here, the chorus can't help but take off.  Even when they verge on cheesy,
    like the second-string Lyle Lovett-styled horns of ""Something New,"" they're
    balanced by the severity of Dunger's throaty vocals.</p><p>
    ""It makes me feel free,"" and, ""I want something she can't give me"" may not be
    Strindberg (or Morrison), but I defy you to make out enough of these lyrics to
    mind.  In any case, Dunger has several nice turns, like ""Lick my soul,"" from the
    title song.  The serious moments on the album-- his solo features like the title
    track and the fragment-like ""Nest""-- have genuine weight, and the last song, ""Pass
    the Chains,"" is a downer, with grim guitar and a creepy piano resonating quietly
    behind.  Dunger's somber moments are brought in as if to remind us he's a heavy
    soul, no matter how pretty the album can be.  But I'm not sold.  The ballads are
    nice, yet they don't have the punch of the brighter moments; this is a record that
    can't stop to brood.</p></div>"|2480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2480-soul-rush/|7.4|Chris Dahlen

    joke. Something about the Hagerty/Herrema combo seemed so right and inevitable;
    the idea that indie rock's Adam &amp; Eve had gone their separate ways was something
    I just couldn't process. I figured Neil would use the press surrounding the split
    as a little free publicity for his debut album, and before you knew it the jig
    would be up and Royal Trux would be back on the rails.</p><p>
    
    Well, if the break-up was a joke, it's a media prank of Kaufman-esque proportions,
    because here we are nine months later, with another Hagerty solo album and still
    not a peep out of Herrema. What's she up to? Neil himself says he has no idea,
    but he's stayed busy with songwriting and has gone back to collaborating.  So, in
    a way, it's sad that <i>Plays That Good Old Rock and Roll</i> ends up the sound of
    Hagerty forming a rock band and getting on with his life.  As such, we get a
    full-band effort featuring two drummers, a sax player, and a handful of strings,
    instead of the first album's lonely, home-recorded homage to classic rock.</p><p>
<i>Plays That Good Old Rock and Roll</i> has some new textural twists for Hagerty,
    but one thing hasn't changed: he's pulled the loaded six-string from his back and
    is soloing his ass off. Only a precious few tracks sneak by without him lurching
    into a feedback-drenched ode to axe-slingers past, and how you feel about that
    probably depends on whether or not you play guitar yourself. Quite honestly, the
    only way a track like ""The Storm Sons"" (with its pitiful ""only god can rescue me,
    only god can make a tree"" couplet repeated endlessly) could have lasting appeal
    is as an instructional tape. Hagerty's lines are distinctive and weird, with an
    intriguing internal logic.  But with a few exceptions, I'm not somebody who can
    listen to balls-to-the-wall guitar soloing for minutes on end.  Caveat emptor on
    the fretwork.</p><p>
    
    Of the nine tracks on this brief record, four seem nothing more than noisy excuses
    for Hagerty's solos.  What's frustrating is that the remainder are solid, and two
    are even great. ""Gratitude"" is a shuffling blues/rock number with a killer rhythm
    hook and minimal lyrics (basically ""thanks a lot"" said a few different ways) that
    manages to stay in your head despite its surface-level banality. The obligatory
    acid-fried guitar solo here works well because of its brevity. Also great is
    ""Oklahoma Township,"" with its 60s R&amp;B; vocal feel and a clever integration of
    violin that reminds me of Alejandro Escovedo. The guitar solo on ""Oklahoma
    Township"" very nearly spirals out of control, but Hagerty reels it in and sings
    alongside it in parallel, nicely redeeming it.  The violin makes another appearance
    on ""Some People Are Crazy,"" elevating what is essentially an excellent late-60s
    Stones ballad with Hagerty on acoustic and a disciplined vocal. And both ""It
    Could Happen Again"" and ""Rockslide,"" both of which sound like lost Woody Guthrie
    songs performed by a garage rock band, are instantly memorable.</p><p>
    
    So that's two great songs, three pretty good ones, and four stinkers. Hagerty's
    always been a little erratic, but that's still not a good ratio. One excellent
    album could have been salvaged from the two he's released in the last year,
    probably, but in these post-Royal Trux days, we have to take what we can get or
    move on. I'm edging closer to the latter, myself.</p></div>"|3701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3701-plays-that-good-old-rock-and-roll/|5.2|Mark Richard-San

    slipping through the cracks.  Aren't you grateful to have us catchers in the rye
    here at Pitchfork rescuing innocent little artistic statements like these from
    the chasm of obscurity?</p><p>
    Limited to 500 copies and lovingly packaged, <i>A Wild Man Brandishing an Uprooted
    Tree</i> is the minimally heralded and seemingly intentionally obscure solo outing
    from Geoff Soule, the drummer of Fuck (who should in no way be confused with the
    God of Fuck).  And while, in the pantheon of solo albums from drummers, this one
    doesn't deliver the goods like, say, almost anything by Robert Wyatt, it beats
    Peter Criss hands down-- even in the arena of cheese-factor, as <i>Wild Man</i>
    comes packaged with a miniature book of haiku detailing, level by level, the
    classic video game ""Mr. Do,"" accompanied by full-color illustrations.</p><p>
    This same kind of perplexing attention to detail (or rather, attention to perplexing
    details) carries over to the music, which was modestly recorded on a four-track at
    home. <i>Wild Man</i> is nothing that's going to single-handedly breathe renewed
    life into the beleaguered genre of lo-fi, but it easily trumps anything Fuck has
    released since 1997's <i>Pardon My French</i>.</p><p>
    Cramming angular indie rock, harsh post-punk freakouts, and folky ramblings into a
    highly digestible 24\xBD minutes is no easy feat, but this record does it by striking
    a deal between tossed-off elegant ease and careful concision. Even the brief
    instrumental interludes don't come off as mere filler-- hell, they make up some
    of the album's best moments, and seem very purposefully selected to ease the
    transition between the wildly dissimilar styles presented by the ""proper"" songs.
    It's all carried off with a similar kind of fractured feeling of
    running-off-in-too-many-directions-at-once that characterizes Skip Spence's
    <i>Oar</i>-- a vision spelled out with the language of surrealism.</p><p>
    ""Ghost,"" probably the mellowest track, leads off the album with an almost country
    vibe as Soule sings, ""My life is a ghost's life, standing at the window watching,
    waiting."" This is following by a jarring guitar workout fittingly titled ""Punk""
    that has the treble cranked to 11, and sounds something like a lost track off
    Wire's <i>Pink Flag</i>.</p><p>
    The weakest track is next, the very Seattle-circa-'92 sounding ""Kant,"" but
    fortunately, this is followed by a wonderful series of songs, beginning with
    ""Ur,"" which reminded me why I still love a lot of lo-fi, bedroom-recorded indie
    rock, no matter how much garbage is released under that mantle. Soule moans, ""You
    are one six billionth falling around the sun,"" while a bassline lurches, followed
    by a little bit of planned sloppiness on the guitar. No drums. Nice and simple,
    but effective. Next is the highly Sebadoh-ish ""Stay,"" dishing up lines like, ""Oh,
    your hair is pawful and my paw is so careful."" Again, the key is that the song
    doesn't outstay its welcome.</p><p>
    Two pleasant enough, though not too outstanding, instrumental songs come up next,
    both sounding something like <i>Wowee Zowee</i>-era Pavement. ""Monkey"" has a slightly
    goofy guitar riff propelling it along, but then again, it's kind of an intentionally
    goofy song to begin with, so it works. ""Vegas"" ends the album on a note similar to
    the opener: observations like, ""Is my arm around your waist? Is my head clear to
    the dump?"" delivered in such a straightfaced manner as to elude to some kind of
    inner logic. It's these kinds of moments that present the album as a riddle to be
    solved.</p><p>
    And the most surprising thing about the album as a whole is how long it holds out,
    revealing its secrets slowly, remaining puzzling enough to bear repeated listens.
    It arrives with all the outward trappings of a vanity item for hardcore Fuck fans,
    and with almost no fanfare-- but when given time to present its case, it ends up
    being quite a bit more. All this from the drummer (of all people) of a mid-level
    indie rock band whose catalog is hit-or-miss at best. Sometimes you get more than
    you expect.</p></div>"|7371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7371-a-wild-man-brandishing-an-uprooted-tree/|7.9|Jason Nickey

Until DJ Shadow's <i>Endtroducing</i>,
    the idea of releasing instrumental versions of rap tracks seemed ludicrous. Who'd
    want to listen to <i>It Takes a Nation of Millions</i> bereft of Chuck D's searing
    commentary and Flav's wisecracking?  Would an instrumental version of <i>Three Feet
    High and Rising</i> be anything more than just a collection of oddball samples?
    <i>Endroducing</i> changed the rules. Shadow's curatorish crate-digging made
    voiceless hip-hop engaging and worthwhile pursuit. Of course, it wasn't too long
    before less notable and skillful beat-forgers converted Shadow's pioneering
    endeavor into a budget-priced bandwagon.</p><p>
    Dan the Automator is largely to blame for this. After resurrecting Kool Keith with
    the Dr. Octagon project, few Automator projects were deemed complete without an
    accompanying instrumental version. These albums attract me even less than remix
    albums. At least with a remix album, you might get an intriguing take on a tune
    you'd previously considered wet shit. Prime example of this is Matthew Herbert's
    <i>Secondhand Sounds</i> remix collection where he transforms putrid slurry such
    as Moloko's ""Sing It Back"" into fascinating concrète funk. But with your usual
    instrumental hip-hop album, it's the same album, only with the vocals excised--
    and without even the expense of hiring Norman Cook to bully his engineer to rig
    up four samples and roll them into a wire ball of predictability.</p><p>
    It need not be this way! Reggae has a long tradition of released vocal and ""versioned""
    readings of albums, like Burning Spear's <i>Marcus Garvey</i> with its Garvey Ghost
    dub version, and Johnny Clarke's <i>Don't Trouble Trouble</i>, and the Aggrovators'
    aptly-titled <i>Johnny in the Echo Chamber</i>.  Surely, there's something that can
    be done about this!</p><p>
    Enter Fat Jon the Soul Physician, the beat creator for the Five Deez crew and a
    salve to all of us that have been exhausted by waiting for true instrumental
    hip-hop. Though the cover of <i>Wave Motion</i> may make blatant reference to
    Stevie Wonder's early 70s third-eye soul, the music is deep and dubby hip-hop
    cool. This ain't the stuff that'll sell K-Swiss trainers-- nor will Fat Jon be
    appearing on the glossy cover of <i>Vibe</i>. This, rather, is the stuff that
    discerning heads will take to their hearts, just as they did with the even more
    daring <i>Soulmates</i> by Bay Area genius Nobody.</p><p>
<i>Wave Motion</i> opens almost programmatically with a sumptuous female vocal
    crying, ""To the Sky! Take me home!,"" as some unidentified hepcat saxophonist
    hollows his low-down mojo. With these two contrasting elements, Fat Jon states
    that this record will be a celestially jazzy homecoming. A tight snare creeps in
    to add just the right amount of head-bobbing funk. With an opening as brazenly
    self-assured and soulful as this, I forget all my previous notions regarding
    instrumental hip-hop.  ""Feel the Void"" adds to my enthusiasm. The track creeps up
    with a liberated bassline that wanders from rhythm to rhythm until a steady
    pattern emerges. Above these elements, a lonesome flute charts a course through
    heartache, only to be goaded into lovelorn desperation by occasional bass clarinet
    farps. Two tracks in, and I've forgotten all about Shadow's over-hyped (not to
    mention disappointing) <i>The Private Press</i>.</p><p>
    ""Visual Music"" is not as oxymoronic as its title suggests. It's an uncomplicated,
    gorgeous téte-a-téte between a restrained drum kit and an array of gently chiming
    guitars, reeds, and keyboards. ""Watch Out"" possesses a distinguishing brightness,
    a feisty club cut after the almost contemplative vibe of the preceding tracks. ""For
    Stress"" clothes the Neptunes' tighter-than-spandex snare sound in ambient spangles
    and Gil Evans horn ensemble lines. ""Eyes"" continues the jazz without sounding
    anything like a Digible Planets or Tribe Called Quest clone. ""Wet Secrets"" vies
    with ""Watch Out"" for the club action. ""Wet Secrets"" will lose out, as the harmonic
    piano clusters lend the track a meditative quality that will be lost on the
    Kristal'd and Red Bull'd masses.</p><p>
    And that's the overwhelming thing about <i>Wave Motion</i>. Fat Jon is a
    conscientious and gifted producer with a talent for creating tracks that work on
    multiple levels simultaneously. The grooves here are never less than utterly
    accessible and smartly funky. But like the album's artwork, there's a depth and a
    melancholy to almost all these tracks. ""Feel the Void"" is a standout in this
    regard, but ""Depths"" aches, too.  <i>Wave Motion</i> isn't an accessory or an
    alternative like so many instrumental albums; <i>Wave Motion</i> is a serious
    proposition and a statement not only of Fat Jon's studio abilities but also of
    his introspective aesthetic.  With the resilience and the emotional draw to
    outlast much of what constitutes any variant of hip-hop these days, this record
    puts Fat Jon on the radar.  Expect great things.</p></div>"|3004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3004-wave-motion/|8.2|Paul Cooper

    Subject: You sucking.</p><p>
    
    My friends and I have a long-running bet about where Pitchfork gets its writers
    from.  St. Maria's School for the Grumpy Deaf?  A work-release program for
    recovering gasoline-huffing addicts?  The annual meeting of the Bitter, Failed
    Musicians Organization?</p><p>
    
    But not until Rob Mitchum's horrid review of the Desaparecidos' <i>Read Music -
    Speak Spanish</i> have I felt compelled to write.  Never I have a read such a
    wrongheaded, closed-minded, biased, bumblefuck, all-around <i>wrong</i> review.
    Shame on you, Mr. Mitchum.  Shame on you, Pitchfork.</p><p>
    
    For starters, what the hell was that lead?  I can't for the life of me figure out
    what the grandmother from ""Who's the Boss?,"" the chemical properties of sodium,
    and the writer's Little League memories have to do with the Desaparecidos.  And
    that joke about a nun, a box of banana bread mix, and Conor Oberst?  Completely
    tasteless and irrelevant.</p><p>
    
    At least once he <i>finally</i> started talking about the music, he got the basic
    facts right (must've spent a few minutes on the Saddle Creek website).  Desaparecidos
    is, in fact, Oberst taking a break from Bright Eyes by putting together a full
    band and ""cranking up the rock knob,"" as Mitchum so poetically puts it.  However,
    your assertion that Oberst has simply exchanged ripping off Jeff Mangum for ripping
    off Gene Simmons is completely unfounded and unfair.</p><p>
    
    In fact, the entire review is permeated with an obvious distaste for the work of
    Oberst, despite Mitchum's elitist claim that he ""kind of likes <i>Fevers and
    Mirrors</i> in an inner teenager sort of way.""  Backhanded compliments like ""the
    distortion-heavy setting at least makes Oberst's emotional breakdown vocal
    theatrics seem somewhat more believable"" or ""this time around, Oberst chooses to
    read from the diary labeled <i>Super Terrible Political Injustices</i> rather than
    the one labeled <i>Girls Who Broke My Heart</i>"" imply a grudge against anything
    Bright Eyes-related, invalidating the writer's entire opinion.  Why would Pitchfork
    assign an album to someone who isn't going to like it?</p><p>
    
    Perhaps if Rob Mitchum had given the album a fair shot, he wouldn't be so quick to
    write off the inter-song sound clip segues as ""devices so unoriginal, they're older
    than Oberst himself.""  As if making fun of Oberst's age hasn't been done to death,
    asshole.  I personally think that the tape recorded conversations about urban
    sprawl and the television commercials sprinkled throughout ""$$$$$"" nicely underscore
    the theme of the album, unlike your ""writer,"" who says he'll ""bet anyone ten dollars
    that Naomi Klein's <i>No Logo</i> is sitting on Oberst's bedside table right this
    second.""</p><p>
    
    And don't even get me started on Mitchum's music commentary, which ranges from
    describing the riff of ""Mall of America"" as ""a metalhead practicing scales in a
    guitar store"" to writing off ""Man and Wife, the Latter"" as ""a less intelligent
    Zack de la Rocha fronting Puddle of Mudd.""  You need to clean out your ears,
    wax-man.  Conor has said in interviews that Desaparecidos is all about the ROCK--
    about playing loud music and sending out an in-your-face political message.  Just
    because a band isn't gazing at their shoes all day and playing their guitar
    through 38 effects pedals doesn't mean they're ""Mongoloid metal.""  Cock.</p><p>
    
    Mitchum's so hellbent on being clever and pleasing your bloodthirsty audience that
    he can't even unconditionally praise the songs he claims to enjoy.  Oh, he'll admit
    that the melody and energy of ""The Happiest Place on Earth"" is ""irresistible,"" but
    then he has to go and pan lyrics like ""opiate of the populace"" and ""our freedom
    comes at their expense"" as being ""less resonant than the latest Rollins Band
    album.""  And since he can't find anything to dislike about the blistering punk
    and keyboard mixture of ""Manana,"" he claims that he only likes it because ""Oberst's
    singing is so slurred that it shields the listener from the gut-wrenching lyrics.""</p><p>
    
    Pretty much the whole misguided appraisal of <i>Read Music - Speak Spanish</i>
    stems from your conclusion that ""Oberst shows occasional, genuine skill as a
    talented songwriter, but he's constantly tripped up by taking himself way, way,
    way too seriously.""  Heh, I'm sure Pitchfork writers <i>never, ever</i> take
    themselves too seriously, do they?  I think your real problem, Mr. Mitchum, is
    your unwillingness to accept the political truths of which Conor Oberst speaks,
    all content in your comfortable little status quo world.  You disgust me.  If
    Schreiber knows what he's doing, he'll can Mitchum's hack ass and find someone
    who gives a fuck.</p><p>
    
    Sincerely,<br/>
    J. Peerless</p><p>
    
    P.S. - Are you guys looking for new writers right now?  Let me know; I've got some
    samples I can send over.</p></div>"|2288.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2288-read-music-speak-spanish/|4.6|Rob Mitchum

    yearn for the skewed-but-effective prose of Mr. James Wisdom, but the title
    does not, in fact, refer to the mindset of its construction. As detailed on the
    inside cover of the album, <i>On Hashish</i> is an homage to German cultural
    theorist Walter Benjamin, who worked on a book bearing the same title, which
    remained unfinished at the time of his death in 1940. Shalabi's <i>On Hashish</i>
    would probably make lousy drug music for anyone but the most daring, anyway,
    because this album is packed with dense, unsettling passages of sound likely to
    trigger a bad freakout in even the most seasoned psychedelic traveler. It's been
    creeping <em>me</em> out, even though I've been sober as a judge every time I've
    heard it.</p><p>
    Shalabi's method for this record was to record instrumental passages by some of
    his favorite Montreal musicians (including bassist Alexandre St. Onge from the
    Shalabi Effect, and Thierry Amar and Norslola Johnson from Godspeed You Black
    Emperor!) and then completely rearrange the recordings into an abstract soundfield
    that owes something to musique concrète. As would be expected given the circumstances
    surrounding its creation, <i>On Hashish</i> is a more difficult listen than the
    more band-oriented affairs of the Shalabi Effect, and winds up being closer in
    spirit to last year's satisfying collaboration <i>Kristian, Shalabi, St. Onge</i>.</p><p>
    The centerpiece of <i>On Hashish</i> is the 26-minute opener ""Outside Chance
    (Dreamfangs)."" Whether or not the title was meant as a pun, it seems plausible
    that chance indeed played a role in the track's composition. The beginning section
    consists of cymbal splashes that sound like a glass endlessly shattering in extreme
    slow motion, random piano tinkles, some distant vocalizations, and periodic bows
    from the double-bass of St. Onge.  A couple minutes of indeterminate percussion
    form a bridge to the next section, a thick cluster of flute tones organized to
    sound like otherworldly sobs.  Stabs of noise, probably emanating from instruments
    being manipulated in non-traditional ways, punctuate this moving passage. From
    there, the piece incorporates assorted field recordings and coasts out on a deep,
    rumbling drone and some analog glitches. An air of ceremony pervades the effective
    ""Outside Chance (Dreamfangs),"" giving it the quality of mourning music from another
    dimension.</p><p>
    ""Soot"" begins with a collective free-jazzy blast of reeds and horns, and then
    modulates into a disturbing bit of drone music anchored around a constantly
    wavering and badly distorted sine wave tone. The electronics continue to do battle
    with the swirl of the horns as other noises fold in, lending a Cageian air of
    chaos. An abrupt cut leads to ""The Wherewithal,"" a nearly eight-minute piece
    cooped mostly of hiss, chirps, static and subsonic rumbles, which manages to be
    comforting despite its noisy surface, almost like a sleep-inducing wall of pink
    noise.</p><p>
    While passages of ""Outside Chance (Dreamfangs)"" are undeniably powerful, ""The
    Wherewithal"" has a truly odd tranquility, and ""Soot"" is impressively abrasive,
    something keeps me from labeling <i>On Hashish</i> as a great album. Part of my
    problem is that it's difficult to imagine the mood that would compel me to pull
    the record from the shelf-- but there's something else missing. These long,
    abstract pieces are definitely meant to be heard in a single sitting, but the
    album as a whole never quite congeals. The pacing seems slightly off, with some
    stretches that degenerate into tedium, and, ""Soot"" aside, there isn't a lot of
    dynamic range.  Still, there are more than enough riveting passages here to demand
    attention from Shalabi admirers, and one has to marvel at the consistently high
    level of the man's prolific output.</p></div>"|7093.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7093-on-hashish/|6.4|Mark Richard-San

Founding members (and at this point, the only ones
    left) guitarist Andy Partridge and bassist Colin Moulding are at once highly
    idiosyncratic, obsessively formal, brutally honest as songwriters, and yet
    suspiciously self-aware.  When Partridge references, in ten separate interviews,
    the same ""exorcism of influences"" in regard to his fondness for the music of
    Brian Wilson and the Beatles, or Moulding spins his bandmate's decision to stop
    touring as the best thing to ever happen to their writing, their old record
    contract with Virgin isn't the only thing that seems fishy.</p><p>
    
    Though XTC could rave it up, most fans will tell you that their strengths probably
    were closer to the studio than the dressing room.  However, it might have been
    nice not to read about the ""quirky, cult heroes from Swindon"" for the last twenty
    years, but rather to see headlines proclaiming the great bringers of creativity
    and classic pop back to the Top 40.  I can't even imagine what Andy and Colin
    would look like on the cover of <i>Spin</i>-- these guys deserved more than they
    ever got.  From the press, the public, their label, and various managers, XTC
    have been a tragically under-appreciated band in every sense.  End sermon.</p><p>
<i>Coat of Many Cupboards</i> celebrates two things: the first being the history
    of XTC, as told through their own viewpoints, and with an extensive essay by super
    fan (and fellow obsessive-- Chalkhills regulars, you know what I'm talking about)
    Harrison Sherwood.  The second is to raise the joyous flag for XTC's final chapter
    involving Virgin Records.  The band left this label in the late 90s, and started
    up their own mess.  Partridge, especially, has been quite happy to expound on the
    plethora of injustices and molestation brought against him by the label (who,
    ironically, are probably in worse shape now than he is), and this set collects
    material recorded during the band's residence under their no-good wing.  Sound
    bitter?  Tell me about it.</p><p>
    
    The four discs of this set are roughly divided into the periods of 1977-79,
    1979-81, 1981-86 and 1987-1992.  Now, many bands half XTC's age already have
    career retrospectives in box form, so this set shouldn't really be special
    in and of itself.  What's odd, though, is that when Partridge and Moulding
    were plucked their choices for the set, they decided that, rather than compiling
    a selection of singles and choice album tracks, they'd fill the majority of the
    box with demo versions and live recordings of their songs.  Bam!  Now you see why
    this set is so necessary for the devoted XTC fan.  In fact, this set is another
    in a growing line of collectible paraphernalia for dedicated fans (along with
    recently issued demo recordings of their proper studio records), as the uninitiated
    will most likely prefer the studio albums over a set of rare rarities and alternate
    takes.</p><p>
    
    The first disc showcases the only era in the band's history when they might
    possibly have been confused for punks.  Tunes like ""Science Friction,"" ""Traffic
    Light Rock"" and ""Radios in Motion"" are fast, a tad out of control (for XTC,
    anyway), and certainly not without their own charming irreverence.  But even at
    this early stage, XTC were more DC Comics than CBGB's.  And how many punk bands
    put Beach Boy sopranos in their songs like Partridge did in ""Radios""?  These boys
    cast themselves much nearer the new-wave camp with the Farfisa spunk of the
    previously unreleased ""Fireball XL5/Fireball Dub"" and the buoyant ""Are You
    Receiving Me.""  Of course, the best songs are the ones that sound like they're
    too hard for real punks to play at all, like the single version (featuring way
    more funky clavinet than an English band in the late 70s should have been able to
    get away with) of Partridge's wonderfully lucid ""This Is Pop"" or Moulding's
    sophisticated acoustic jaunt, ""Ten Feet Tall.""</p><p>
    
    The second disc picks up the story wherein XTC were making the transition from
    attention deficient rowdies to something altogether brainy (and yet, still rocking
    hard enough to be mentioned in the same breath as the Jam).  ""Life Begins at the
    Hop"" is a peppy piece of ska-pop (reportedly featuring Sting on ""lead handclaps""),
    and one of the last times XTC could claim to be addressing the ""boys and girls""
    on record.  The finest moments are during the room-clearing zeal of ""No Language
    in Our Lungs"" and the wonderfully quaint demo version of their minor 1982 hit
    ""Senses Working Overtime.""  There's also an excellent, early live version of
    ""Snowman"" which is almost worth the price of admission, if only to show what kind
    of band they might have been had Partridge not suffered a crippling (and apparently
    permanent) bout of stage anxiety.  The band sounds invincible, tearing through a
    song that sounded almost ambient at times on the <i>English Settlement</i> LP, yet
    never loses grasp of its whimsical atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    Disc 3 begins with an unused single recording of the non-album track ""Punch and
    Judy.""  ""Punchy"" is a good word to describe the rocky ping-pong groove of the
    tune, though it's clear that even by 1981, XTC were already more interested in
    working in the studio (check the nifty piano line, and subtle, panned guitar work)
    than onstage.  ""Fly on the Wall"" is more processed pop strangeness (and as legend
    has it, a song which Virgin was planning as a single, only to listen with
    devastation at the rather impenetrable thing which XTC had produced), and the
    live ""Yacht Dance"" is a pretty convincing argument for the band not touring--
    its refined arrangement, and emphasis on acoustic rather than electric textures
    wasn't the kind of thing that could ever rile up the concert crowds.  Of course,
    the band would venture further into progressive pop craft and studio experimentation
    than most people ever might have predicted in 1978.  1983's gorgeous ""Ladybird""
    and ""Love on a Farmboy's Wages"" sparkled with such delicacy and fine craftsmanship
    that you'd have a hard time besting it outside of classic Beatles or Kinks.  A
    modest demo version of their biggest American hit, the controversial ""Dear God,""
    points toward their increasingly baroque tendencies, while at the same time
    showing that, despite the fact they'd given up the music biz game, XTC were
    hardly becoming complacent.</p><p>
    
    The final disc captures the band at its most overtly Beatlesque (with a fair
    amount of Beach Boys and Burt Bacharach as well), and even features a couple
    of gems by their psychedelic alter egos the Dukes of Stratosphear.  However, fans
    will probably want to check previously unreleased tunes like ""Terrorism"" (an
    aggressive, mildly Middle Eastern rocker), ""Find the Fox"" (a mild-mannered, loping
    acoustic song that wouldn't have sounded out of place on <i>Skylarking</i>) and
    ""The Troubles"" (a South African-styled, straight pop number).  XTC will reportedly
    release several more discs of previously unreleased songs and demos over the next
    few years (with the project moniker of Fuzzy Warbles), but for now, these will
    do nicely.  The disc also features an interesting home demo of ""The Mayor of
    Simpleton"" that's very stripped down, and with largely different music altogether
    from the <i>Oranges &amp; Lemons</i> version.  XTC's final entry for the set is a
    modest live version of ""Books Are Burning,"" which closes things on a solemn yet
    hopeful note, just as it did on 1992's <i>Nonsuch</i>.</p><p>
    
    Of course, things have turned out okay for XTC.  After leaving Virgin, they
    released the acclaimed (and very nice, if I may say so) <i>Apple Venus</i>, and
    followed it with the more straightforward <i>Wasp Star</i>.  If this box set
    demonstrates anything, it's that there really has been a clear journey imbedded
    in their music.  Just as Partridge is fond of detailing the cycle of life in many
    of his songs, so too can you hear the growing pains and heady mixture of angst,
    joy and awkwardness of change in XTC's music at various moments.  You know, they
    were (and are) a pretty fucking cool band, so far be it from me to dock them for
    staying home on weekends.</p></div>"|8834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8834-coat-of-many-cupboards/|9.0|Dominique Leone

    and self-referential slipstream novel, <i>Valis</i>. What meager plot the book
    contained concerned Vast Active Living Intelligence System (VALIS), which, in
    short, attempted to explain what every religion and creed known to humanity is
    really on about. <i>Valis</i> was Dick's search for discernable reality, if such
    a thing exists, through the Tractates Cryptica Scriptura, a system of precepts
    that Dick's alter-ego Horselover Fat had constructed. Given that Horselover Fat
    was the English translation of Dick's name, <i>Valis</i> was a dialog between
    segments of his mind, which had been driven ever more to fracture since Richard
    Nixon's resignation in 1974.  The message of <i>Valis</i> seemed to be that the
    only coping mechanism for a bonkers world is to go mad yourself.</p><p>
    
    But Christian Kleine offers a second solution-- one that actually might offer
    temporary respite.  Kleine's <i>Valis</i> will definitely not answer any nagging
    theological doubts you have, nor supply you with a first-class ticket to paradise,
    but these six indie-inflected chill-out tracks are soothing enough to release you
    from your woes.</p><p>
    
    Kleine's music is based on the principle that simple things can become complex
    when aggregated.  For instance, the bassline of the opening track, ""Boon,"" is the
    bassline from the Cure's ""The Forest"" but played by a simpleton. This otherwise
    inept bassline deftly props up all manner of chiming Cocteau Twin-ish guitar sounds
    and digital atmospherics that everyone has been familiar since Warp's Artificial
    Intelligence days.  Kleine adds a minimal hip-hop rhythm for the chillheads to
    bob along to, and lets his concoction roll out. ""H:Y"" sounds like a dubbed-out
    b-boy instrumental as performed by those austere manipulators of sound, Appliance.
    Oddly, ""Red Norvo"" contains no detectable vibraphone, as one would expect a track
    named after one of the foremost players of that instrument. Yes, Kleine's ""Red
    Norvo"" has plenty of chimy rings to it, but whereas your typical IDM track achieves
    the effect with synthtones, Kleine appears to be using an electric guitar.</p><p>
    
    ""Accent"" is an altogether tougher beast-- the beats are spiked brass knuckle-dusters
    and their patterns are almost as furious as Norwegian junglist DJ TeeBee's. But to
    maintain at least the sense of chill, Kleine swamps these angry beasts in tranquil
    ambient pads and a nervous melody that skitters through them seeking resolution.
    ""Unauthorized"" finds Kleine at his most fractured.  Here, the militant beats win out
    over the ambient pads-- they're still present, just buried under the thrall of
    beat-down percussion.</p><p>
    
    ""Several"" is something like a fusion of Papa M, Carsten Nicolai, and the highbrow
    applied jungle of Elliot Sharp.  But however unsettling that sounds, Kleine tames
    these competing elements to produce a gentle compromise. This compromise is the
    key to understanding Kleine's version of <i>Valis</i>. Kleine juxtaposes antithetical
    elements and challenges himself to seek a resolution to the contrast, just as Henry
    Moore and Barbara Hepworth used massive blocks of stone to express the form of
    voids.  If the solution to any problem is to be judged by both its efficiency and
    its beauty, Kleine's version of <i>Valis</i> far outranks Dick's.  But if I were
    you, I'd hold out for the much more daring <i>Our Noise</i>, Kleine's collaboration
    with Morr Music labelmate Thaddeus Herrmann-- it's far less beholden to Ulrich
    Schnauss' <i>Far Away Trains Passing By</i> and elevates both Kleine and Herrmann
    to the top of the premier league.</p></div>"|4491.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4491-valis/|6.3|Paul Cooper

What's the point? Not eclectic enough to be enjoyed as a sampler, too
    confining to be much of an extended statement, and too long to highlight the
    strength of a single song like a seven-inch could, they tend to come off like
    pathetic time-stalling ploys between albums or repositories for second-rate
    (or worse) material.  But, as with all things, there are exceptions. And this,
    my friends, is a big one.</p><p>
    Within the realm of country-leaning indie rock, one will be hard pressed to find
    three better songs from My Morning Jacket than the three they lead this record off
    with.  And the lone Songs: Ohia track, though more of a completist affair typical
    to these kinds of releases, is nothing to scoff at, either.</p><p>
    What My Morning Jacket confronts us with here is a band on top of its game.
    Though any discussion of these guys will almost assuredly bring up their sounding
    like somewhere been Neil Young and the Flaming Lips, the whole truth is they sound
    like <i>a lot</i> of classic bands and artists-- ranging from the Allman Brothers
    to Television-- but in the final summation, they sound like no one but themselves.</p><p>
    ""O Is the One That Is Real"" is the kind of song a well-wishing fan would hope they'd
    release as a college radio single from an album, instead of on a split EP that'll
    likely be overlooked at the end of the day. It's a song that positively <i>could</i>
    break the band to a wider audience, easily bettering anything the band has recorded
    so far. It has the mark of a classic stamped all over it: a catchy but slippery
    guitar riff, slightly anthemic lyrics, and powerful, confident delivery. An
    attention-grabbing snare crack kicks off the song before singer/guitarist Jim
    James wails, in his reverb-drenched, honey-n'-whiskey-soaked voice, ""Always leave
    your television on/ Always keep your answers by the phone..."" By the time the song's
    reached its peak, with James singing his guts out, ""The radio will play"" over and
    over again, you find yourself un-self-consciously singing along, and maybe even
    dusting off the old air guitar. In one fell swoop, it eliminates years of indie
    rock indoctrination forbidding all non-ironic displays of enjoyment and identification.
    And it's a beautiful and liberating thing.</p><p>
    ""How Do You Know"" is a quasi-ballad with amazing if perplexing lyrics that manage
    to be evocative despite themselves: ""Who fanned the fire that burned down the
    lake?  One, two, three, four things I'd rather forget."" The songs builds in a
    similar fashion to the first, with a great dual guitar solo and a classic-rockish
    drum fill bridge that comes off as completely necessary.</p><p>
    ""Come Closer"" is a full-on ballad with no apologies, and though it may sound more
    like a Neil Young song than anything of My Morning Jacket's previous work, they
    pull it off like Crazy Horse-- I can say with a fair amount of confidence that it
    would have made a great b-side for ""Heart of Gold,"" had that space not already
    been occupied by ""Sugar Mountain.""  The subject is love and longing (what else?),
    and James has never sounded more genuinely forlorn.  And that's no small statement
    for a man who once sung, ""When dark touches your skull, you can dump that on me.""</p><p>
    After a 2\xBD-minute palette-cleansing track which sounds like the first three songs
    sped up and reversed, Songs: Ohia evens out the EP with a 10-minute version of ""Be
    Your Own Guide,"" a song that appeared as an untitled track in a vastly different
    form on last year's live album, <i>Me Sei Apparso Come Un Fantasma</i>.  A sparse,
    acoustic jam session captured to tape by Paul Oldham at his studio in Shelbyville,
    Kentucky, it's notable for featuring his brother, the Bonnie Prince himself, and
    Appendix Out's Ali Roberts. But, before you wet yourself, it should be noted that
    Will Oldham's backup vocals are mixed low in the background (we're talking the next
    room here) and his words are few and far between. Even so, his voice is unmistakable,
    even at a distance, and his harmonizing with Ohia frontman Jason Molina on the
    Emersonian title/refrain is stark and moving. It may not be the dream match-up
    fans have envisioned since Songs: Ohia released its first single on Palace records
    so long ago, but it is far more affecting than you might expect.</p><p>
    And so, what we end up with is a split EP of another breed-- one on which actual
    talent meets top-shelf songwriting, rather than the usual we-found-this-one-in-the-closet
    contributions.  Showcasing both bands at what is, thus far, their artistic apexes,
    the record is well worth its $7.49 sticker price.  And that's a hell of a lot more
    than you could say for Rancid and NOFX's <i>BYO Split Series, Vol. III</i>.</p></div>"|5530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5530-split-ep/|8.5|Jason Nickey

After a series of highly publicized in-court
    battles with the Backstreet Boys and N'Sync resulted in the legal annulment of his
    managerial duties, he's been forced to subsist on a disrespectfully small severance
    package (only one-sixth of the respective groups' entire earnings?) and a diet of
    ""exclusive"" tell-alls. But the question plaguing every pre-pubescent music lover
    and-- let's face it-- the whole world is: what will this self-professed 'pop
    guru' do next?</p><p>
    Though his name is nowhere to be found amongst the album's succinct liner notes,
    it's pretty hard to ignore the argument that Brendan Benson's <i>Lapalco</i> could
    very well mark Pearlman's return to the world of image consultation and pre-packaged
    musical commodity.  Nevermind that there's no actual evidence of any official
    contact between Benson and Lou (or ""Big Poppa,"" as he's come to be known in the
    most elite circles of Tigerbeat fandom). All the tell-tale signs of Pearlman's
    influence are here, if you look hard enough. Lapalco's cover art, for instance,
    finds Benson dressed in prototypical thrift store attire and eating from a
    single-serving box of breakfast cereal; an ingenious marketing ploy that immediately
    establishes the album's target demographic! It almost makes one feel guilty for
    enjoying the disc so thoroughly.</p><p>
    With 1996's <i>One Mississippi</i>, Brendan Benson crafted an impressively catchy
    collection of songs whose instant accessibility belied the complex arrangements
    that resided just beneath the obvious hooks. Pieces such as ""Sittin' Pretty"" and
    ""Tea"" invoked the ghosts of early R.E.M. and the Beatles while managing to elude
    the nauseating sense of pastiche induced by many like-minded acts who populated
    mid-90s alternative radio. Unfortunately, Virgin's mishandling of the album
    squandered whatever commercial success Benson was poised to achieve and precipitated
    a number of label disputes, delaying the recording of a proper follow-up for years
    on end. Die-hard fans-- and there actually <i>were</i> a handful-- wept. Luckily,
    their wait was not in vain, as Benson has fashioned yet another sterling pop record
    replete with his standard jangle-pop songs and anthemic rockers, and a smattering
    of pastoral psychedelia.</p><p>
    Aside from guest production by Jason Falkner and his occasional vocal accompaniment,
    Brendan performs, sings, and produces every note of <i>Lapalco</i>, lending even
    the most aggressive tracks an indefinable sort of intimacy. Nowhere is this more
    evident than ""Metarie,"" which features a surprisingly effective lyrical meditation
    on lost love while skirting an obvious structural similarity to Elton John's
    ""Rocket Man"" (of all things!).</p><p>
    Occasionally, though, the very elements that make Benson's music endearing can, in
    excess, be counterproductive. ""You're Quiet"" which boasts the refrain, ""I've been
    a little down on my luck/ I think you know where I'm coming from/ I need a pick-up
    and I don't mean truck,"" typifying the record's lyrical pandering and goofiness.
    Elsewhere, ""What"" strives to use the word ""girl"" as many times as humanly possible
    within a 3\xBD-minute window, which not only proves that Brendan ascribes to the musical
    school of thought which prizes quantity over quality, but also hints at his presumed
    employment by Big Poppa.</p><p>
    But regardless of its spotty lyricism, <i>Lapalco</i>'s intelligent and understated
    melodies indicate that we have a true talent on our hands-- especially on ""Tiny
    Spark,"" which launches the album with an infectious Moog riff that soon blossoms
    into one of the most driving tracks in the man's canon.  His unadulterated giddiness
    is certainly contagious and, when channeled correctly, makes for some surprisingly
    potent music. Though it's futile to predict whether or not he's capable of
    transcending his influences, it's comforting to know that, with rave reviews in
    <i>Esquire</i> and an endorsement from Jack White of the White Stripes, Lou
    Pearlman will sleep soundly tonight.</p></div>"|655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/655-lapalco/|7.4|Kevin Adickes

The way I see it, you've got two immediate problems:</p><p>
    
    1) You must navigate through a vast, soundless expanse with only a handful of
    recognizable landmarks and;</p><p>
    
    2) You must to carefully ration the air in your own small space to avoid
    suffocation.</p><p>
    
    It's a unique situation in its ability to spook the hell out of both claustrophobic
    and agoraphobic character types.</p><p>
    
    Aspera's <i>Birds Fly</i> EP is a terrific musical simulation of the above conditions.
    This is a weird little disc, full of moonboot synthesizers, short snatches of eerie,
    reverbed guitar, and the kind of overwhelming drum sound I tend to associate with
    latter-day Flaming Lips.  Of course, the Flaming Lips are an obvious comparison--
    as is Spiritualized!  But where those bands cultivate sound so thick it could swallow
    you whole, Aspera pulls back just at the moment you expect a thunderous chorus.
    This is not bad; in fact, the relative sparseness of some of these songs creates
    a serious sense of weightlessness. For a psychedelic band leaning ever closer to
    space-rock with each subsequent release, this, for me, is a desired result. But
    just as a single body, drifting through the vastness of space, seems awfully tiny
    and insignificant, the vast majority of these songs suffer from their disproportionate
    ratio of instrumentation-to-silence.</p><p>
    
    I had reservations about this technique from the very beginning of the title track,
    which begins with a high-pitched carnival keyboard and super-spare drumming. When
    the guitar and bass enter for the chorus, the song recovers enough density to keep
    me from wondering whether the tinny quality of the music was a deliberate effect
    or an offshoot of poor recording. (For the record, I'm almost positive it's the
    former, but I could be wrong.)</p><p>
    
    Despite its chorus of synthesized voices, ""Heaven's on Your Right Side"" never
    completely solidifies, perhaps because the dirge-like drums of the verses do
    little but call attention to what's missing. That the chorus reminds me of a
    zero-gravity rendition of ""You Are My Sunshine"" only exacerbated the problem.
    There's a very nice instrumental bridge that again reaches nearly reaches full
    sound capacity only to end too quickly.</p><p>
    
    And this is a problem that plagues <i>Birds Fly</i> as a whole. In contrast to
    psych and space-rock's progenitors, Aspera keep the vast majority of their songs
    at just under three minutes-- a feat achieved by stopping just before what seems
    to be the natural conclusion of the song.  This is fine for one track, maybe, but
    when an entire record follows this model, it makes you wonder if it isn't just a
    contrivance to mask running out of steam.  Or, put another way, these are not bad
    songs-- they just sound unfinished.  Yet, where an album might suffer terribly
    from so much vacancy, the brevity of the EP format (and of the individual songs)
    makes the affectation somewhat more digestible.</p><p>
    
    Aspera's departure from the more straightforward psychedelia of their earlier
    releases bodes well for future innovations, and the time that passes between this
    record and their next full-length may give them time to grow into all that space.</p></div>"|324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/324-birds-fly-ep/|6.1|Alison Fields

    <i>Ten</i>-era Eddie Vedder knock-off or a sensitive lad throwing his voice up
    and down the register like Dave Matthews.  What you end up with is the musical
    equivalent of the generic-brand cereals strewn across the bottom shelves of the
    nation's grocery chains.  You know, those ones with the slightly altered names
    like ""Captain Crunchy"" and ""Honey Hives.""  It's a phenomenon that's always
    intrigued me: are these singers just reflecting their primary influences, or
    is it a shameless attempt to penetrate a jaded radio listener's brain by
    momentarily convincing them they're listening to a new song by their favorite
    band?</p><p>
    
    I wouldn't accuse Son, Ambulance of such crass commercial manipulation. After
    all, they record for Omaha's tiny Saddle Creek label.  What are they gonna do?
    Tour with No Doubt? (Uhh...) But I can't help getting hung up on the fact that
    <i>Euphemystic</i> really, really sounds like it was recorded by a lisping Ben
    Folds with a slight head cold.  I'm sure bringing up Joe Knapp's vocal resemblance
    to Mr. Folds is a well-trodden comparison, but goddamn, it's hard not to make.
    If Folds' voice were a portrait, then Son, Ambulance would be one of those guys
    who sits in a museum every day for weeks painting a near-exact replica.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps I'm being unfair, and Knapp's resemblance to Folds is nothing more than a
    bizarre evolutionary convergence of the two singers' vocal cords.  But Knapp
    doesn't do himself any favors by choosing the piano as his weapon of choice for
    the majority of these songs.  And ""Brown Park"" from Son, Ambulance's debut EP,
    <i>Oh, Holy Fools</i> (a disc which also featured labelmates Bright Eyes) sounded
    so much like a <i>Whatever and Ever Amen</i> b-side you could probably convince
    Robert Sledge that he played bass on it.</p><p>
<i>Euphemystic</i>, at least, never reaches that song's blatant Ben Folds Fivery.
    For one thing, Knapp's songwriting style is considerably less traditional,
    incorporating abrupt tempo shifts, complex rhythms, and sparse arrangements rather
    than bright harmonies and orchestral bombast.  The album opener, ""An Instant Death,""
    is enough to make a drummer go on strike, accelerating and decelerating between
    spacy finger-picking, piano-driven strut, and guitar riff-rock worthy of an early
    Big Star album.</p><p>
    
    Despite these gymnastics, Knapp and Co. present significantly brighter skies than
    the gloom-and-doom melodrama of labelmates Bright Eyes and the Faint, with
    unabashed romanticism like ""I Promise You'll Never Grow Old,"" a track which segues
    into and out of the theme from ""Sesame Street"" without breaking stride-- and it
    doesn't sound half as cheesy as you'd expect.  Meanwhile, attempts at gravitas,
    like the Taco Bell Latin inflections of ""Maria in Motion,"" are embarrassing
    missteps.  Knapp is at his best when he sticks to the piano, as on the striking
    solo track ""A New Dress for Maybell,"" rather than throwing overly precious synth
    swirls onto tracks like ""A Book Laid on Its Binding.""</p><p>
    
    Ironically, the more Son, Ambulance emphasizes the piano, the more it sounds like
    (to further beat a dead horse) Ben Folds outtakes.  Luckily, I have a soft spot
    for the ""Brick""-layer, so it doesn't bother me like a vocal resemblance to, say,
    Don Henley would.  But sadly, <i>Euphemystic</i> is not quite a strong enough
    album to let me forget the similarity, nor does it present any other characteristic
    noteworthy enough to structure a record review around.  Should Joe Knapp ever find
    his voice-- literally-- his band may be yet another band to watch out of the city
    <i>Time Magazine</i> is calling the ""Rock Scene to Watch.""</p></div>"|7326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7326-euphemystic/|6.2|Rob Mitchum

    reasons we tend to rough up their sort.  It isn't because they're fey little
    rockers with penchants for intolerable whimpering; it isn't because their songs
    are overwrought with empty frustration; and it isn't because their fashion sense
    is anally pre-meditated and accessorized (though all three certainly apply).
    No, our complete disregard for this band-- whether you or your five-year-old
    cousin thinks it's unwarranted or not-- stems from a much simpler base: they
    aren't any good.</p><p>
    Need some proof with that statement?  What excellent timing!  The Kids are in
    the studio <i>as we speak</i> dishing up another plate of steaming teenage
    caricatures for springtime consumption.  And in the meantime, they've given us
    <i>Eudora</i>.  In 1997, when they dropped their first full-length for Doghouse
    Records, <i>Four Minute Mile</i>, the Get Up Kids instantly made a name for
    themselves by beating tried-and-true pop formulas over the cracked skulls of
    aspiring pro-skateboarders.  And this was enough for me.  But with <i>Eudora</i>,
    they somehow succeed at making some of the greatest pop songs ever written-- songs
    by the Pixies, David Bowie and the Cure-- sound like just another GUKpile.</p><p>
<i>Eudora</i>, for better or worse (and I know which <i>I'm</i> siding with here),
    is a 17-track collection of hard-to-find, but nonetheless previously released
    material.  The Kansas City bad boys horde far more than their fair share of
    covers on this disc, resulting in a vicious bloodbath of unprecedented brutality.
    Pulled from the wreckage are ""Alec Eiffel,"" ""Suffragette City"" and ""Close to
    Me,"" as well as the Replacements' ""Beer for Breakfast,"" New Order's ""Regret,""
    and-- yikes!-- Mötley Crüe's ""On with the Show""?!  While these songs improve the
    songwriting of the standard Get Up Kids release by roughly infinitely, it
    unfortunately taints these time-honored classics to know that these guys have had
    their way with them.</p><p>
    Still, like I said, these are far greater songs than the Get Up Kids should have
    the privilege to soil, and if I'm choosing between this and, say, <i>Something to
    Write Home About</i>, I'm gonna side with the one that actually had some talent
    involved <i>somewhere</i> down the line.  Besides, it really is hard to fuck up
    a great song.  All you have to do is show up, and play the notes-- it'll sound
    decent, perhaps even convincing.  But all of this fails to answer the real
    question: why bother?  It's like Donald Trump's AC version of the Taj Mahal. Does
    anyone need a head-on collision between Sum 41 and Hello Kitty grossly reanimating
    the Spiders from Mars?  No!  Nobody needs this!</p><p>
    And just like no one needs to familiarize themselves with a hackneyed cover of
    a brilliant song, so it goes for the hyper-drivel and anti-melody of ""I'm a Loner,
    Dottie, A Rebel,"" and the constant reversion across the album to vocal harmony in
    a sad attempt to achieve some kind of homogenized catharsis.  ""Shorty"" takes a
    shot at dynamics with chunky guitars and scream-sung vocals, fading out with
    <i>extra-</i>chunky guitars and <i>super-screamy</i> scream-sung vocals.  Let me
    say it one more time for emphasis: NOBODY NEEDS THIS.</p><p>
    That is, except for those among us infected by rabies-- i.e. the card-carrying
    members of the Get Up Kids fanclub.  As they froth at the mouth, they will remain
    unpersuaded by anything I have to say. They'll probably spend (or have already
    spent) their hard-earned allowance on this collection of diddly-poo. The rest of

I get home from the plant and there's my woman:
    rolling around in my bed with my best pal, Big Whitey.  And there's my mutt sitting
    on the floor, watching them go at it with his stupid dog-grin.  I just can't get
    that image out of my mind.  Man, I flew into a <i>crazy</i> rage, stormed out to
    my 81 Buick and tore dirt right out of that greazy hellhole.</p><p>
    
    The only thing that helps this pain in my gut is the new album by Okkervil River.
    I don't know what you'd call their music-- alt-country or indie rock or avant-folk
    or some such crossbred super-genre.  Calms the nerves, though.  Sure, it's kind of
    a downer, but without hitting the gutbucket misery of real country.  And Okkervil
    can also let fly, too: the best song on the album, ""Lady Liberty,"" smokes like a
    raccoon in a chimney, with horns blasting behind singer Will Sheff as he moans
    about loving the wrong woman.  ""I can picture you inside some stranger's house/
    Inside some stranger's bed/ You're trying to seem mysterious/ The covers pulled
    over your head.""  Ain't nothin' stings like the truth.</p><p>
    
    Okkervil River sounds like a loose outfit; their self-released 1999 debut, <i>Stars
    Too Small to Use</i> was raw, shambling stuff, but with this new record they're
    starting to pull it together.  The songwriting is impressively poignant, and the
    music is as tight and comforting as any old noose: under producer and engineer
    Brian Beattie's wing, the band has filled out and arranged these songs beautifully
    with every southern-flavored instrument you could dream up-- mandolin, pedal steel,
    fiddle, organ, and strings and horns.  The record maintains a nice, lush air, but
    manages to stay somehow raucous simultaneously-- it's ponderous indie rock and
    country charm frequenting each other's local haunts.</p><p>
    
    But while these guys may be rising stars, they're still looking for comfort and a
    little love, if the lyrics are any indication.  Damned if ""My Bad Days,"" for one,
    isn't as stark as they come: Sheff can sound like a man who's been beaten back to
    a lost little boy.  ""Dead Dog Song"" is a mandolin-propelled tune with great,
    hokey lyrics (""He'd never been to church, so he doesn't have a soul"").  And
    the guys even bring in Daniel Johnston to duet on ""Happy Hearts,"" just coming
    straight out and pleading for what we're all after: <i>""Unconditional love, why
    did you leave me?""</i>  Come on, guys, you're killing me.</p><p>
    
    But one song in particular got my attention: ""Westfall,"" the account of a murderer
    coming to trial.  As alt-country serial killer ballads go, this one has nothing on
    Jim White's ""The Wound That Never Heals""-- but it's a good song about evil and
    murder, and it almost sounds convincing when these nice boys sing: ""They're
    looking for evil/ Thinking they can trace it/ But evil don't look like anything.""</p><p>
    
    So it's past two in the morning and I'm still driving, when suddenly I see someone
    by the side of the road-- a woman, hitch-hiking-- and damned if she doesn't look
    like, well... just like my wife on her best day (twenty years ago).  I know it
    can't be her, but I'm transfixed.  She's got her thumb out and though I know it's
    wrong, I decide to pull over.  I swerve to the side of the road and let her walk
    up to my car.  Satan was arm-wrestling for my soul, but this time the Lord won: I
    hit the gas and skidded away before she got to my door.  She didn't look too happy,
    but hell, she doesn't know how close she came to having something awful happen to
    her, 'cause I know I'm still in a funny mood.  Anyway, there isn't room enough in
    the trunk for a third body.</p></div>"|5960.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5960-dont-fall-in-love-with-everyone-you-see/|7.2|Chris Dahlen

    foot pole.  Early in my musical development (in my case, we're talking high school
    here, or maybe eighth grade), I was full of biases against all kinds of genres. I
    was certain that hip-hop sucked, electronica was all just a bunch of boring,
    go-nowhere beats, and that bastard rock music had been monopolizing the airwaves
    for upwards of forty years.  I'm sure the young, arrogant me would be awfully
    surprised going through my record collection these days and seeing just how much
    of it was recorded after 1990.</p><p>
    
    My friend Brian has always said that if he ever went back in time and met himself,
    he'd want to kick his own ass for being such a moron.   I often find myself feeling
    the same way, but I think that instead of giving my younger self a good whomping,
    I'd be more apt to put an album like this in his hand and tell him to really
    listen to it.  I'd tell him that it's free music, totally improvised live as a
    soundtrack to a few independent films.  And he'd be incredibly skeptical.  Improvisation
    was another one of the categories that I had shut myself off from.  Somehow, I got
    it in my head that, if a song hadn't been pre-written, it couldn't possibly be
    any good.  And I'd have argued that point, too, with no evidence to back up my
    claim.</p><p>
    
    Of course, I don't really know what I would have thought of this when I was
    thirteen, but I imagine that hearing it would have at least opened my eyes to
    the fact that freely improvised music doesn't have to be abrasive or difficult
    (though sometimes the best of it is).  But my views on just about everything have
    changed since then, and at this point in my life, free music fascinates me to no
    end-- be it the jazz freakouts of the Art Ensemble of Chicago or the chance music
    created by a guy like Steve Reich.</p><p>
    
    I basically support Ornette Coleman's notion that being free from the confines of
    regular structures and chord progressions opens musicians up to limitless
    expressive possibilities.  Much to my delight, this new Califone disc supports
    that notion remarkably.  Several of these pieces seem to have at least some sort
    of verbally conveyed structure, but virtually none of them adhere to the
    conventions of form that most music does.  The pieces themselves are all quite
    varied in approach from each other, some building in long crescendos, some pulsing
    listlessly, and others behaving almost like songs, with steady beats and coherent
    melodies.</p><p>
    
    This approach to scoring films is nothing especially new-- Pink Floyd was doing
    it as early as 1969, and I'm sure they weren't the first-- but I've always found
    it to be incredibly effective at evoking the emotion or the mood present on the
    screen. Pinetop Seven's stunning improvised score to <i>The Wind</i> is so vivid
    that I could practically visualize the film before I even saw it.  And while
    Califone's scores for a series of film loops, as well as one other short film,
    are quite so visually evocative, they do carry a profound sense of emotion that
    keeps me connected to them even when they're at their most obtuse.</p><p>
    
    The first six tracks are music set to film loops constructed by Jeff Economy
    (who also performs some accordion and live foley) and Carolyn Faber.  By and
    large, the ensemble avoids the obvious trap of performing repetitive music
    over it, instead opting for sounds that flow freely from one emotional state
    to the next.  This is really a Califone record in name more than in practice, as
    mainstays Ben Massarella and Tim Rutili are accompanied by five other musicians
    (and Economy), each of whom contributes rather evenly to the overall sound.</p><p>
    
    The eight-minute opener ""Handpainted Halo/Ceiling"" is one of the album's most
    stunning tracks, opening with an extended series of ambient washes and organ
    drones.  At the six-minute mark, Massarella and Joe Adamik enter with drums and
    assorted other percussive objects (including sheet metal and bedpans), giving the
    music a more songlike feel and a steady pulse for the delayed guitars and mellow
    organs in the foreground to rest on.  As the tune progresses, the drums and
    percussion gradually move out of synch, eventually stopping to leave the other
    instruments to wander and drone for a couple of minutes before moving on to the
    shorter ""Rooftops/Static.""</p><p>
    
    ""Rooftops"" employs some deft live electronics (courtesy of Gary Schepers) and
    tribal drums to drive along the ominous organ and swelling, warm synth.  ""Face
    Under Hat/Old Streetside"" has the feel of a lazy nighttime jam, with its wandering
    lap steel, dingy guitar riffs and eddying electric piano.  The drums punch out a
    laid-back but steady beat as the interplay between the melodic instruments slowly
    moves into bluesy territory and then back again, finally devolving into a
    disorganized ambient soup for ""Parade Queen/MilkWaltz/Dirt Moon.""</p><p>
    
    And out of <i>that</i> rises ""Lakewater/Parachutes,"" a gorgeous jam that rides on
    a steady backbeat.  Rutili and Rebecca Gates' heavily delayed guitars reverberate
    over a gossamer web of organ, and one of them actually ends up crafting a sort of
    hook for the whole proceedings.  The first set closes out with ""Peel,"" a duet
    between Gillian Lisee's accordion and Rutili's guitar that benefits from subtle
    interjections of organ.</p><p>
    
    The second set originally provided accompaniment to Ladislaw Starewicz's <i>The
    Mascot</i>, and finds the band moving more rapidly between textures.  It opens
    with the quietly graceful ""Intro/Sleepy Child Asks for an Orange,"" and moves
    through all manner of material, from the electronic ""Monkey, Cat, Ballerina
    and Hood Escape from Moving Car/Clown Loses Head/Dog Stays"" to the raw ""Fruitstand
    Floor/Ankle Bite/Dog Steals Fallen Orange/Broom,"" a bluesy junkyard jam that
    would've fit nicely on last year's <i>Roomsound</i> if not for its brevity.  Jim
    Becker's fretless banjo provides a kind of drunken lead as the rest of the group
    motors away underneath, expanding and contracting the tempo on a whim.</p><p>
    
    One can only begin to imagine what the film in question looks like, confronted
    with sectional titles like ""Hellions Assemble,"" ""Hell Orchestra with Dancers,""
    ""Cat Fights Devil,"" and ""Garlic Head Clown Serenades Ballerina Crying Vaseline
    Tears.""  The set closes with ""Dog Feeds Orange to Sleepy Child/Outro,"" which is
    one of the most straight-up beautiful moments on the album.  Warm synths, organ,
    swelling guitar leads, and lightly strummed chords are all that comprise the
    spare track, and it closes things on a remarkably serene note.</p><p>
    
    Taken as a whole, <i>Deceleration One</i> is an enjoyable, richly textured listen,
    full of moments of quiet incidental beauty and dense noise alike.  I'd even go so
    far as to say that it may be a good introduction to improvised music for rock fans
    who feel a little queasy about jumping straight into an Ornette Coleman or Sun Ra
    Arkestra album.  Granted, the gentleness of this music puts it apart from a lot
    of other improvised records, but it's a great primer on the absence of rigid
    structure and planning.  Regardless of your motives or biases, though, if you're
    looking for an excellent instrumental disc, this disc delivers.</p><p>

    One of the great, universal inspirations throughout the history of rock and roll
    has been the death of a relationship.\xA0 In 1972, Carly Simon scored a hit with
    ""You're So Vain,"" a thinly-veiled sendoff to former beau Warren Beatty.\xA0 John
    Lennon, while separated from Yoko Ono, wrote some of his most harrowing songs,
    such as ""Jealous Guy.""\xA0 And at the core of Fleetwood Mac's <i>Rumours</i> was
    the searing open wound of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks' messy breakup.</p><p>
    Throughout her career, Alanis Morissette has railed in a similar manner at an
    unnamed lover from her past, a mysterious figure described only as an older man
    from her days at Nickelodeon.\xA0 But now, on the promotional tour for <i>Under Rug
    Swept</i>, Morissette has bravely revealed the identity of her bitter muse: Dave
    Coulier!  That's right, when Morissette had one hand in her pocket, the other hand
    was giving the finger to Uncle Joey on the 80s television hit ""Full House.""\xA0 It
    was like ray-eee-ain on your wedding day when her and Dave Coulier broke up.  And
    yes, the person she went down on in a theater was... Dave Coulier.  The man don't
    mess around.</p><p>
    Coulier's ghost continues to float over and around Morissette's music, perhaps
    while doing his famous Popeye impression and mugging wildly.\xA0 The Canadian
    confronts this secret relationship in her most direct manner yet on the first
    single from <i>Under Rug Swept</i>, ""Hands Clean.""\xA0 By assuming Coulier's voice
    and singing lecherous lines like, ""Just make sure you don't tell on me, especially
    to the members of your family,"" and, ""I might want to marry you one day if you'd
    watch that weight and keep your firm body,"" Morissette must be making Coulier very
    uncomfortable wherever he is today.</p><p>
    This fierce independence finds its way into every aspect of <i>Under Rug Swept</i>,
    her first album without the assistance of professionally licensed hitmaker Glen
    Ballard.\xA0 Morissette was obviously taking notes during their previous two
    collaborations, however, as these eleven songs retain the <i>Jagged Little Pill</i>
    formula of safely looped drums, angry guitar, and Alanis' trademark clenched-teeth
    yodel.\xA0 The immediacy is further amped by the fact that Morissette plays nearly
    all the instruments on the album, finally putting to rest the rumors that she's
    nothing more than a producer's puppet.</p><p>
    The most marked effect of breaking away from Ballard's input is the unmitigated
    and highly concentrated ferocity of her lyrical confessions.\xA0 It's no mistake
    that <i>Under Rug Swept</i> comes off like a 45-minute glimpse into her daily
    therapy session.\xA0 Morissette wants to put a little bit of her head inside of
    yours, riding on a catchy hook-- to give all of us a taste of what it feels like
    to be dumped by Dave Coulier.  Because even though ""it's been over a decade/ It
    smarts like four minutes ago.""\xA0 Observe:</p><p>
    ""Flinch"": ""How long can a girl be haunted by you?""</p><p>
    ""That Particular Time"": ""I kept on ignoring the ambivalence you felt/ And in the
    meantime I lost myself.""</p><p>
    ""So Unsexy"": ""I'm 13 again/ And I'm 13 for life.""</p><p>
    Obviously, the emotional pain persists, many, many long years after ""You Can't Do
    That on Television.""\xA0 All Alanis wants is for the world to dance and sing along
    with her catharsis.\xA0 Can you really hold it against her?  Of course not!  So
    don't think you can write Morissette off as doing nothing more than cataloging
    her relationship grievances.\xA0 On ""21 Things I Want in a Lover,"" Alanis files an
    audio personal ad of what she's looking for in a man (note to fellas: be against
    capital punishment, and inventive in bed!), a move that could come off as
    self-indulgent, but in a personality as luminescent as Ms. Morissette, is nothing
    short of entrancing.\xA0 And on the somber ""A Man,"" Morissette boldly composes lyrics
    from the perspective of... a man!  Perhaps the target of one of her many incendiary
    diatribes: ""Born of your bellies I yearn for the cord/ Years I have groveled
    repentance ignored.""  Dude, that begs for a Mustaine solo.</p><p>
    If <i>Under Rug Swept</i> has a weak point, it's in the lack of musical variety,
    with few tracks deviating from electric or acoustic versions of the above-stated
    formula.\xA0 These exceptions show a knack for appropriating the sonic vocabulary of
    other artists to fit Morissette's vision, such as the Elton John-inspired piano
    rocker ""That Particular Time"" (""This Train Don't Stop There Anymore,"" anyone?).
    Her skills at adaptation are most striking on ""Narcissus,"" in which Alanis mines
    the familiar Liz Phair trademark of minor chords, swear words and attitude, and
    shows once and for all that, while Phair may have invented the modern angry-female
    act, Morissette perfected it.</p><p>
    Frankly, it's a small matter, since with lyrical messages this strong and profound,
    a little bit of stylistic homogeneity can be forgiven.\xA0 Even without the disturbing,
    sad, confusing, and (okay, I admit) mildly hilarious knowledge that her songs are
    directed at Uncle Joey, the emotional potency of <i>Under Rug Swept</i>'s songs
    cannot be denied.\xA0 On ""So Unsexy,"" Alanis admits that sometimes she ""feels so
    boring for someone so interesting.""\xA0 But with an album this compelling, she really
    needn't worry.</p></div>"|5429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5429-under-rug-swept/|8.4|Rob Mitchum

    Holy shit. No words could better describe the last two substandard LPs by heralded
    Christian contemporary artists Jars of Clay, once purported to be their genre's
    artistic torchbearers.  But after ascending to popularity with their critically
    acclaimed 1995 self-titled release (indie cred: co-produced by King Crimson's
    Adrian Belew, et. al.), which blended lush harmonies, organic guitars and spacious
    sampled drum tracks, the quartet regressed into something more ass-like.  They
    recorded two albums of standard pop fare, the kind enjoyed less by college kids,
    and more by their 30-something, married and mustached youth group leaders.</p><p>
    
    If Jars of Clay's mission was to prove that Christians really aren't lame, they
    were fighting a losing battle.  Facing an uncertain artistic future, the Jars had
    two clear options: 1) make a career-saving pact with the devil, or 2) return to
    form.  With option one foreclosed by the irresistible grace of our Lord, the Jars
    chose the path less traveled-- and that has made all the difference.  Jars of
    Clay's newest disc, <i>The Eleventh Hour</i>, is triumphant, just as likely as
    their debut to tug at your heartstrings and stoke your inner-burning flame.  Like
    Lazarus, they arise.  Thank God.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with the edgy pop of ""Disappear,"" reminiscent of their 1995 MTV
    hit, ""Flood"" (and its confusing video of a tormented retard stuck in a mud bog).
    ""Disappear"" shows more melodic polish and punch than ""Flood,"" though, reflecting
    seven years of songwriting maturity.  The lyrics are as strong and suggestive as
    ever, radiating with an odd, bubbling joy.  Following that is ""Something Beautiful,""
    and man, is it!</p><p>
    
    The album's first single, ""I Need You,"" continues with the passion and intensity
    that Jars fans know and love, expressing a deep desire for God and harking of
    ""Love Song for a Savior"" with the simple lyrics, ""I need you/ I need you/ I need
    you.""  (And someone needs to get on the horn to McCartney about that lyric, maybe
    he can recoup some of the plagiarism damages on ""My Sweet Lord"" for Harrison's
    estate.)  The lyrics of ""Scarlet,"" on the other hand, focus on a more earthly
    sort of need-- booty (well, not exactly, but it is about men and women).
    Musically, the song continues with more of the Jars' style of creative, sensible
    pop-folk with a clever and catchy result.  It's probably the strongest track on
    <i>The Eleventh Hour</i>.</p><p>
    
    I don't know what woke these guys up; maybe it was the tragedy of September 11th,
    maybe it was some sort of revelation.  Maybe someone in the Jars camp just got
    sick of biting the fat one, what with the acoustic chaff on ""If I Left the Zoo.""
    Whatever it was, their return from their three-year hiatus and seven-year swamp
    is more than welcome-- it's positively refreshing, a fragrant and pleasing
    offering to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  The Lord may reign over the
    heavens, but <i>The Eleventh Hour</i> proves that Jars of Clay still rule over
    Christian rock.</p></div>"|4210.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4210-the-eleventh-hour/|7.0|Brad Haywood

    She's back.\xA0 The woman who brought American audiences that terribly rigid version
    of ""The Locomotion"" in the late 80s has risen from the dead (or massive overseas
    popularity, depending on how you look at it) to sock it to the red, white and
    blue just like she did 15 summers ago.\xA0 Okay, so that may not have been Kylie
    Minogue's primary motivation behind <i>Fever</i>, her ninth album overall, but
    it's probably going to be the subject of the most of the press she gets in the
    U.S.\xA0 In fact, this is hardly her ""comeback,"" since during the time she last
    made the Top 10 here, she was the most popular female pop singer in Europe and
    Australia.</p><p>
    Perhaps a re-introduction is due. \v\v33-year-old Minogue first achieved
    fame as a child actress in several dramas, most notably the soap opera ""Neighbors.""
    When the soap began airing in the UK, Minogue's popularity soared. In 1987, she
    recorded a demo version of Little Eva's 60s pop hit ""The Locomotion"" for charity,
    and actually submitted the recording to the UK label Mushroom.  Mushroom was fairly
    keen to release something by the young star, though weren't necessarily impressed
    by the recording.\xA0 The label decided to turn the Minogue situation over to a team
    of producers they'd just entered into a partnership with: Stock, Aitken and
    Waterman, who were fresh of producing major hits for Bananarama, Rick Astley and
    Dead or Alive.
    Of course, Stock, Aitken and Waterman wanted to work with Minogue, but didn't
    take her very seriously, and didn't even have material for her on the day she
    showed up to their studios.\xA0 Legend has it, they came up with the tune ""I Should
    Be So Lucky""\xA0in ten minutes, which became Minogue's second #1 single in Australia
    and England.  Perhaps due to the relatively haphazard experience of recording
    under the SAW blade, Minogue gradually took matters into her own hands throughout
    the 90s.\xA0 The team continued to work with her in the early 90s, as Minogue scored
    more hits, and even began contributing her own lyrics.</p><p>
    Her work ethic has been similar to Madonna's, in that she makes it a habit to
    produce interesting videos for her songs (usually opting for the role of seductress
    rather than clean cut girl-next-door), and always keeps her sound current.  She
    also worked with many different collaborating producers after leaving the SAW
    team in 1991.\xA0 Her relationship with the late INXS singer Michael Hutchence
    resulted in further musical experimentation, going so far as to work with Nick
    Cave for the tune ""Where the Wild Flowers Grow,"" in addition to working with
    members of Manic Street Preachers for her 1997 release <i>Impossible Princess</i>.</p><p>
    It wasn't all good times for Minogue, though, as her jaunts outside the dance-pop
    realm weren't received very well, critically or popularly.\xA0 She was actually
    dropped by her label after <i>Impossible Princess</i> (the gall!), only to
    resurface in 2000 with the back-to-basics, disco-drenched <i>Light Years</i> LP.
    She received co-writing credits on about half the tunes, and managed to retain
    control of her career while simultaneously jumping back into the limelight.
    <i>Fever</i> continues in this vein, adding a touch of adult-contemporary
    soft-groove in amongst the dancefloor escapades. \v\vMinogue brought in former
    dance-pop star Cathy Dennis to collaborate this time around, resulting in three
    songs: ""Can't Get You Out of My Head,"" ""Come Into My World"" and ""Dancefloor.""\xA0
    The first song launched Minogue back into relevance in the U.S., with its very
    dry arrangement, straightforward disco pulse and breezy, <i>Xanadu</i>-esque
    bridge.\xA0 The song exudes a catchiness that belies its inherent simplicity, so
    reassuring during an era when chart acts sound increasingly baroque and producers
    race to see who can ape electronic music trends first.  And with the tag ""set me
    free,"" perhaps Minogue is saying something about her relationship to trends in
    modern pop.</p><p>
    The album initially brings to mind the sound of younger acts like N'Sync or
    Britney Spears, but where they tend to favor more aggressively spectacular
    production, Minogue seems comfortable with a basic groove, minimal backing, and
    vocals bared up in front.  ""Come Into My World"" is a more traditionally
    disco-oriented track, reminiscent of Eumir Deodato's fantasy soundscapes, and
    with the alluring refrain, ""Come, come, come into my world.""  ""Dancefloor"" is
    straight club music, along the lines of old-school Lisa Stansfield or the Real
    McCoy's eurodisco standards.</p><p>
    Songs that don't quite succeed on that level are the title track, which is punchy
    but sounds a little too clean cut for someone who's asking if ""you feel the fever
    like I do.""  The production isn't quite as current as the rest of the album, as
    if Minogue suddenly had an 80s flashback.  ""Fragile"" is nicely atmospheric, but
    verges on being indistinct if you're not paying close attention.\xA0 Conversely,
    ""Give It to Me"" attempts a more aggressive posture, though I think at this point
    Minogue is better at being straightforward and smooth than down and dirty.\xA0 As a
    whole, <i>Fever</i> works well as an icebreaker for grown-up parties and the
    Sunday mornings after.  It's a mature sound from a mature artist, and one that
    may very well re-establish Minogue for the VH1 generation.</p></div>"|5313.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5313-fever/|7.6|Dominique Leone

    This is the third in a series of BYO-released split CDs pairing up big-time punk
    bands.\xA0 The first was Leatherface and Hot Water Music.\xA0 The second was Youth
    Brigade and the Swingin' Utters.\xA0 Now we get NOFX and Rancid.\xA0 Tim ""Lint""
    Armstrong came up with the idea of the bands covering each other's songs--
    therefore we get Rancid doing six NOFX songs, and vice-versa.\xA0 Cute! \vFirst up
    is Rancid's take on NOFX's fast-paced new-school\vstandards.\xA0 ""Moron Bros"" is cut
    number one,  a fast-paced romp through punk-rock silliness that musically sets
    the tone for the rest of Rancid's set.\xA0 It's a pretty nice adaptation, though
    with a rougher edge than the original.  Let's just say that Armstrong and Lars
    Frederiksen's sloppy vocals are a far cry from harmonious.</p><p>
    The real standout in Rancid's half of the record is ""Sticking in My Eye,"" which
    they play very true to the original.\xA0 Matt Freeman funks up the bassline in
    typical too-many-notes-in-too-little-time fashion, proving once again that he's
    far too good a bassist to be in Rancid.\xA0 The track is full of catchy melodies and
    infectious harmonies, and is the only time on the record where Rancid doesn't
    come sounding like a drunken garage band. \v\vIt's a steady downhill decline from
    there.\xA0 Specifically, ""Don't Call Me White"" is borderline unlistenable.\xA0 Lars
    Frederiksen's barf-bag vocals are so off-key it makes you wonder how the rest of
    the band lets him get away with it.\xA0 They slowed this one down quite a bit to
    give it more of an ""Oi!"" feel, and yet, it just turns into a boring, sludgy mess.
    Sorry, fellas, the joke ain't funny when a white guy sings it.\xA0 It is, however,
    funny when Fat Mike sings it-- he's Jewish!</p><p>
    The same problem prevails on ""The
    Brews"" (as in 'Hebrews', not a 30-pack of Stroh's), the other side of the ""Don't
    Call Me White"" coin.\xA0 It's also about being Jewish, but this time they sped up
    the tempo.  The original was slow, with fuzz-drenched guitars mixing well with
    the poppier vocals, whereas Rancid's version is a generic upbeat rocker.   It's
    still relatively effective, but far inferior compared to the original.\v\vRancid's
    final offering comes with ""Vanilla Sex,"" a mid-tempo campfire protest song about
    censorship.\xA0 Lyrics like, ""Don't ever take away from me my pornography"" may've
    sounded fresh to 2 Live Crew back in 1989, but it just doesn't cut it in these
    fast and furious times.  Note to protestors: if you're fighting against censorship,
    don't use porn as your main prop.\xA0 No senator is gonna get behind a pro-porn bill.
    NOFX's half is stronger, thanks in no small part to the fact that NOFX actually
    have some personality.\xA0 They're as tight as ever here, adding an interesting flair
    to the Rancid songs.\xA0 They kick it off with ""I Am the One,"" which is either about
    suicide, or god, or both.\xA0 Beats me.\xA0 It's a pretty generic punk rocker (and I
    don't even <i>necessarily</i> mean that in a bad way), with the group yelling,
    ""Hey! Hey! Hey!""  NOFX adds some much needed humor to plenty of these Rancid
    tracks, like here when guitarist El Hefe pulls off a perfect Fat Albert.\xA0
    Hilarious.</p><p>
    Fat Mike admitted that he made no attempt to imitate Freeman's bass style, but he
    holds his own in ""Tenderloin.""\xA0 This is a typical Rancid song, combining gutter
    punk and rock and roll.\xA0 It's pretty weak, really.\xA0 But it's short, so that makes
    it okay.  Then there's ""Olympia, WA,"" which has an intro guitar lead that's
    catchier than the clap.\xA0 The breakdown towards the end practically dares you to
    not get fired up when it kicks back in.  The whole thing closes with another classic NOFX stunt.\xA0 They took one of Rancid's
    bigger hits, ""Radio,"" and transformed it from a punk-rock anthem into a laid-back
    reggae jam.\xA0 El Hefe takes the lead vocals on this one with an odd combination of
    Jamaican and Hispanic accents.\xA0 The result is really pretty funny-- similar to
    NOFX's own staple ""Kill All the White Man.""</p><p>
    When Screeching Weasel and Born
    Against teamed up back in 93 to perform songs written by each other, the results
    were great.\xA0 A big part of their success with that project, however, stems from
    the fact that each band only did two songs.\xA0 With the NOFX/Rancid CD clocking in
    at 12 tracks, it's just too much.\xA0 I'm sure they had fun with it, and I'm sure
    they love listening to each others' contributions, but for us, the record-buying
    public, a lot of it just seems unnecessary.</p></div>"|5824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5824-byo-split-series-vol-iii/|4.4|Cory Byrom

    The e-bow is a small electronic device for playing guitar, and was introduced in
    1976, inspired by the mad violin-bowing antics of original Iron Butterfly guitarist
    Danny Weis.  When applied correctly, a sound somewhere between the spacy whistle
    of a theremin, the slow swell of a guitar looped backward, and that electric
    violin Poindexter played in <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i> is emitted from the ax of
    your choice.  E-bows have long been a favorite toy of bands from all genres, used
    by everyone from Radiohead and Built to Spill to Nazareth and Metallica to Flock
    of Seagulls and Modern English.  Now that's diversity.</p><p>
    E-bows are one of those musical gadgets cool enough to liven up even the dullest
    musical product.  Case in point: Edison Woods, a Brooklyn quintet (give or take
    a cello player) whose motto seems to be ""not rocking out is the new rocking out.""
    Reflecting a galaxy of influences ranging all the way from Low to Low's side
    projects, Edison Woods subscribes to a musical sensibility some would describe
    as ""minimalist"" and some others (guess who) would describe as ""boring.""</p><p>
    The songs of Julia Frodahl are largely built around a simple acoustic or electric
    piano riff of four or five notes, cycled over and over and over for the duration.
    The bass and the drums play similarly non-evolving patterns, blending in with the
    keys to produce a constant drone throughout most of the eight tracks.  Meanwhile,
    Frodahl's vocal timbre never strays beyond the slowcore standard-issue breathiness,
    and the background vocals of bassist Alex Emanuel fail to push the band's singing
    into the complex harmonies of similar acts in this vein.</p><p>
    This looks like a job for the e-bow!  And a fella named Joe Mendelson is happy
    to oblige, layering his device's astral sounds over and above otherwise languid
    tracks with poetry slam titles like ""Dream of Things"" and ""Fear and Yearn.""  With
    his contributions, ""Vivian"" builds to a washed-out climax like a low-budget
    approximation of Sigur Rós, who, incidentally, prefer to bow their guitars the
    traditional way.  Later, Mendelson squeezes out soft tones from his guitar that
    make the coda for ""Lullabies and Goodbyes"" sound like Brian Eno submerged in goo--
    it's the one moment on the album where the calculated quietude becomes dense,
    interesting ambient ambiance.</p><p>
    Taken together, these cuts serve as an excellent demonstration of proper e-bow
    usage, flavoring the songs around it with an otherworldly texture.  'Tis sad
    then, that Mendelson's deft handling of the device is surrounded by the pedestrian
    stylings of Edison Woods; even my low-bpm-loving roommate found the majority of
    the album to be a snooze with its piano and cello set pieces like ""Winterlude.""
    With luck, Edison Woods will trade Mendelson to a better band for draft choices
    and cash before the deadline, and the e-bow will find a home more worthy of its
    technological brilliance.</p></div>"|2683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2683-edison-woods/|3.9|Rob Mitchum

Not too warm, now; just right. The
    breeze is perfect, not too strong, yet with enough of a presence to remind you
    that you're alive as it brushes across your face.  It's a perfect day.  An
    acharacteristically pleasant day in a usually gloomy part of the year.  And no
    matter how cynical you may be, you can't restrain the first hints of a smile
    creeping across your face as you head home, where your girlfriend waits, cooking
    you dinner.  Your favorite dinner, at that.</p><p>
    
    When you walk through the door,
    you can tell from the look on her face that something is wrong. She says nothing--
    just meets you with a grim stare-- then turns her gaze to the answering machine
    across the room.  Without a word, your eyes meet its persistent blinking. You
    cross the room, press the button. It's a message from your doctor. He asks
    you if you remember the routine tests he did the last time you visited the office.
    He says that something's come up.  Something's not right.  You don't even wait
    for the message to end.  You call him up, your heartrate pacing, there's sweat on
    your brow.  Your awareness of the world around you has suddenly vanished.</p><p>
    
    When you resurface, it's harboring the news that something is horribly wrong
    indeed.  Chronically wrong.  You've now got anywhere between a month to twenty
    years left to live.  There's really no way to tell when, but you are definitely
    going to die.  Across the room, she stares at you. Your eyes meet hers.  No
    words are exchanged.  She cries; you say nothing. Your eyes fall to the ground
    as you drag your feet out the door again.</p><p>
    
    Outside, it's still a gorgeous day-- the sun still hits your skin just right, the
    birds still sing the same as before. And yet, suddenly the whole world is
    different. Everything is ominous where before there was only beauty. Everything
    from the sound of traffic to the cock-headed gaze of your neighbor's dog has
    become a harbinger of your imminent doom.  Nothing's actually changed about the
    world.  Except your perception of it.</p><p>
    
    This is what the music of the ambient trio Codec Scovill is like. It's comprised of
    subtle little changes that occur in the midst of long, beautiful, repetitious
    segments.  Little, ominous changes.  The kind that turn the world on its side.
    The kind that can turn a perfect day into the worst.  When the album begins, it
    does so peacefully. Four tones are layered upon each other repeatedly, allowed to
    float around, to vibrate and harmonize in empty space.  But soon, effects and
    feedback build up, and the anxiety sets in.</p><p>
    
    Like most ambient music, <i>Clinical Imperfections</i> doesn't change much. There
    are lots of long tones here.  They start out quiet and they build.  They have
    some particular destination in mind, but rather than reaching it, they meet up
    with other tones halfway there. And they'll disappear only to return later and
    repeat the process. But while the sounds themselves rarely change, the context in
    which they are presented does. When five-to-ten minutes of signal-routed tones
    are interrupted by anything-- be it a minimal beat and fidgety static (""Alpine""),
    or a jarring wash of feedback (""Hohner 36""), it's hard to listen the same way
    when the tones return. Jarred from the peaceful introspection often induced by
    ambient music, the listener is now forced into an uneasy awareness, intimidated
    into paying attention.</p><p>
    
    This inherent paranoia is nourished later by beautiful yet chilling tracks like
    ""Traipsing,"" where a faint ghostly melody lingers like the memory of a deceased
    family member that will not pass, at once disturbing in its insistence and
    reassuring in its familiarity.  But familiarity is not always a good thing. If
    there's one fault to be found with <i>Clinical Imperfections</i>, it's that
    bands like Nurse with Wound and SPK have covered similar territory to better
    effect.  Still, <i>Clinical Imperfections</i> is well-executed: ambient music
    twisted into something alarming by the right interjection at the right moment.</p></div>"|1526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1526-clinical-imperfections/|8.2|David M. Pecoraro

    Autechre's algorithmic expositions and the Boards of Canada's ingenue nostalgia.
    Despite a deal with the Finnish label Exogenic, Nikko's previous album,
    <i>Kobn-Itch-Ey</i>, was an MP3-only release posted on his website-- Nikko
    thereby set his sights further abroad than merely his Finnish homeland. What
    irks, however, is that Lassi expanded his outlook only when it came to
    distribution.  <i>Claro</i>, like its predecessor, is exactly what you'd imagine
    an Autechre/Boards of Canada collaboration to sound like, provided neither of
    them gave half a fuck.  No surprises here, then.  Just another diligently focused
    album that demands you pay attention to its careful approximations of other
    people's styles.</p><p>
<i>Claro</i> opens with a modicum of promise. ""In"" is an intriguing collection of
    calliope flutters that cluster around a hummable tune.  However, the following
    track, ""Brothomstates Ipxen,"" simply sounds recovered from the <i>Confield</i>
    recycle bin.  And it's decked out in triggered aerosol hi-hats that hiss to a
    close in a series of end-of-the-pier Wurlitzer flurries!  ""Kava"" serenely drifts
    through the subdued moments of Autechre's <i>Tri Repetae</i> accompanied by...
    yet another diverting calliope!  And on ""25101999,"" Nikko returns to more
    mechanical Autechre-isms, never appreciating Booth &amp; Brown's unraveling narrative
    mathematics.  ""-"" is almost as empty as its title, a skipping broken-beat pattern
    playing host to a frolic of tinkling toy instruments.</p><p>
    
    Then comes ""Mdrmx,"" Nikko's adoring tribute to <i>Music has a Right to Children</i>,
    with its softly echoed, fragile melody wanders through a poppy field of percussion.
    Beginning in a gloomy tide of thick bass burps, ""TeNochRP"" soon embraces a labored
    imitation of contorted steel. Just to heighten his sincerest brand of flattery,
    Lassi adds a dose of hip-hop swagger to the track in honor of Autechre's more
    b-boy side project, Gescom.  With a judicious remix, the lumbering ""Natin"" could
    be transformed into a formidable Freq Nasty nu-school electro cut. As it stands,
    the track is far too pleased with its crinkled sophistication to be the effective
    battle weapon it could be.  <i>Claro</i> (thankfully) concludes with ""Viimo"" which,
    at the last opportunity, does nothing to pull originality from the jaws of
    accomplished predictability.</p><p>
    
    As I've found with all too many recent IDM albums, <i>Claro</i> is utterly beholden
    to the twin fontes et origines of the style.  And like too many others, Nikko
    proves himself a disciplined and occasionally astonishingly beautiful mimic, but
    a mimic nonetheless.  This record does nothing to show the world what Lassi Nikko
    has to contribute, other than adding yet another light to the other bright but
    derivative lights that seek to eclipse each other in atmospheric intensity.
    Nikko's addition to this firmament, already radiant with banality, does nothing
    but blind me and force me to take a break from this whole genre temporarily. At
    the moment, I'm finding the murkier no-drama beats of Req's <i>Sketchbook</i> so
    much more illuminating than all of this dazzling but formulaic imitation.</p></div>"|963.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/963-claro/|5.2|Paul Cooper

    anemic tourist industry.  After all, the country is absolutely gorgeous, rich in
    natural resources, and offers the best health care system known to man. How could
    anyone stay away from the place? Well, you see, Canada is plagued by what we in
    the business call ""sameness."" Yes, its true that each respective city is built
    from a different ilk of lumber, and that wayward ice flows occasionally interrupt
    daily life, but there's simply not enough topographic diversity to warrant the
    bursting tourist industry Canadians so desire. Similar criticisms can be made of
    uninspired music, which often finds an artist reiterating a particular sonic
    trick one time too many.</p><p>
    Which is why its painful to call the music of Greg Davis uninspired.  The kid's
    certainly got some talent and originality up his sleeve, but no matter how many
    subtle variations in accompaniment garnish <i>Arbor</i>, his debut for New York's
    Carpark label, its songs tend to bleed into one another like those indistinguishable
    Canadian territories.</p><p>
    Music critics will revel in such horrible headliners as ""Múm's the Word"" or ""Aphex's
    Twin"" when reviewing <i>Arbor</i>. The latter being a catch-all, a last resort for
    any and all electronic music artists to have the unfortunate role of being reviewed
    by an unimaginative writer. While it's true that Davis and Múm both conjure up
    glitchy meditations of very similar moods, Davis' instrumentation is confined to
    his laptop, guitar, and the occasional sampling of an iconic folk legend.  And
    though he does manages to explore a fair amount of sonic territory in spite of
    this, there's not enough compositional diversity to sustain repeated listens.</p><p>
    But <i>Arbor</i> isn't without its merits. The opening track alone, ""Submersion
    Tank Part One (V.2),"" justifies the record's release and makes for a gorgeous
    introduction into Greg's world of escapist musical montage. Here-- and nearly
    everywhere else on the album-- he employs deftly struck vibraphones, small
    flourishes of muted white noise, and the occasional interjection of computer-generated
    beeping as foundation for his valium-induced haze of sound. Elsewhere, the album's
    title track finds Greg plucking out a desperate and unadorned acoustic melody for
    nearly nine minutes.  And in fact, the song manages to remain engaging for the
    majority of its duration.</p><p>
    Yet, at other moments, Davis' experiments fall short.  ""Nicholas"" is the worst
    offender here.  It samples the fragile refrain of Nick Drake's ""Introduction""
    before mutating into a big beat-cum-IDM number and dousing Drake's original
    material in gauzy phaser effects.  Though it does lend the album some much-needed
    diversity, its pandering and derivative performance is awfully weak, making
    ""Nicholas"" an awkward inclusion on an otherwise decidedly down-tempo affair.</p><p>
    Regardless of its flaws, <i>Arbor</i> pulls off a rare feat: a promising debut.
    In fact, Davis' more concentrated efforts often rival-- and occasionally better--
    his contemporaries, based purely on originality.  But until his tendency to wander
    aimlessly about is firmly inhibited, I'd wait on investing my hard-earned money
    in his music.</p></div>"|2188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2188-arbor/|7.9|Kevin Adickes

    I'd let a Frankenstein punch me in the stomach<br/>

    --Jad Fair, ""Near to You""</p><p>
    Man, that's devotion.  Jad Fair wants to be near you so badly he'd undergo just
    about any hardship the universe could throw at him to make it happen.  I guess
    the only question remaining would be this: would you want Jad Fair to be that
    near to you?  Your answer is likely to vary based on your point of view.</p><p>
<i>Words of Wisdom and Hope</i> is one of those records that just begs questions
    about its intent.  This is due entirely to Jad Fair's presence, as Teenage
    Fanclub's musical contributions can practically be viewed as a separate artistic
    entity from Fair's geeky rambling.  Still, the questions are there:  is this
    brilliance or ignorance?  Naïveté or irony?  Transcendent or annoying as hell?
    Once again, your answer is likely to vary based on how you view music like this.</p><p>
    Of course, this is nothing new where Jad Fair is concerned.  Over the course of
    around 40 albums-- many recorded with his band Half Japanese-- Fair has constantly
    reveled in his own lack of conventional musical skill and consistently begged
    these sorts of questions.  Many have come to revere him as an iconoclastically
    charming artist or even a sort of outsider artist, while just as many really can't
    stand the guy.</p><p>
    So here's where being a record reviewer becomes especially difficult.  It's
    supposed to be up to me to figure out the answers to those three questions I
    asked earlier, and I'm finding that I really don't know any of them for sure.
    It does seem obvious enough that Fair is no idiot, and he must have <i>some</i>
    concept of just how hokey his delivery and words are, but it seems just as
    obvious that he doesn't care one way or the other.  So, in lieu of a real solution,
    let me say this: people who already like Fair will likely enjoy this, as will
    people who revel in impromptu-sounding performance and unabashed sentimentalism.
    And just as many others will hate it outright.</p><p>
    To figure out which camp you're in, perhaps a bit of dry objective description
    will help.  Fair's delivery on this album's twelve tracks is entirely spoken,
    mostly in a dry, subdued Mr. Rogers tone, though he occasionally offers a little
    coo or tiger growl to drive home how in love he is with his anonymous subject.
    He never gets melodic, he only rarely tailors his rhythm to the music, and he
    frequently sounds like he's having a one-sided conversation with a soundtrack in
    the background.</p><p>
    The subjective description: Fair's straightforwardness is occasionally refreshing,
    and many of his quirky observations are quite charming, but more often they're
    irritating and cloyingly cute.  Whether or not he's being ironic or naïve ceases
    to become important after a while, because most listeners will be utterly sick of
    listening to him by the time the album is halfway over.</p><p>
    Consider the following lines:</p><p>
<i>""Early in the morning.  No chance of robot uprising.  Look what the sunshine
    brings.  It's a brand new day."" --""I Feel Fine""</i></p><p>
    ""My heart is literally jumping like a kangaroo.  I mean, not literally, but
    poetically.  I mean... well, you know what I mean.""  --""The Power of Your
    Tenderness""</p><p>
    ""I want to be your Superman.  I would not be satisfied being your Batman or
    your Aquaman.  No.  I want the very best."" --""Cupid""</p><p>
    These are three of Fair's more amusing observations, though even the funniest
    moments in his monologues are probably best described by one of his past album
    titles: somewhat humorous.  Often, he finds himself talking with nothing to say,
    but he invariably keeps talking anyway.  The pun on the title ""You Rock"" of ""you
    came along when I had nothing and gave me a rock"" gets hard to swallow after he's
    already said it a couple of times, especially when he follows it by mumbling
    ""rock solid love.""</p><p>
    On the other side of the coin is Teenage Fanclub, fresh off the U.S. release of
    their sixth album, <i>Howdy!</i>  The band offers up a batch of instrumentals for
    Fair to talk over that draws from every one of their past periods, from the
    fuzzy rock of their earliest records, to the country flavors of <i>Songs from
    Northern Britain</i>.  The highlight for both the band and Fair is probably ""Near
    to You,"" for which the band offers up an alternately jangly and fuzzy stomp that
    propels Fair's rambling perfectly.</p><p>
    Nearly as successful is ""Love's Taken Over,"" wherein Fair actually almost sings
    (without ever actually getting there) and the band's blend of uplifting harmonies,
    bells and delayed snare drums proves one of the most interesting textures they've
    ever come up with.  The album's other major musical peak comes with the
    seven-minute ""Crush on You."" Though the song is undoubtedly far too long, the
    band offers up a spontaneous-sounding jam that somewhat makes up for it.  Opener
    ""Behold the Miracle"" is also brimming with fine organ work and an excellent
    bassline.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, the band doesn't seem to have as many ideas.  As a result, ""The Power
    of Your Tenderness"" is overly repetitive, while ""Vampire's Claw"" benefits from
    some pretty banjo and fiddle, but ultimately doesn't go much of anywhere musically.
    ""Secret Heart"" attempts funk, but never gets propulsive enough to truly achieve
    it.</p><p>
    Okay, so if I've done my job, you now have at least some idea of what to expect
    from this album.  In the end, I think a straight five is the only rating that's
    really appropriate for a release like this.  Chances are that when you hear it,
    you'll either fall in love or hate it.  As for me, I don't think I'll be listening
    to it again for a long time.  Rather, it's the kind of record I'll be filing away
    and pulling out now and then when I feel like springing something truly odd on my
    unsuspecting friends.  The nutshell: proceed with caution.</p></div>"|7954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7954-words-of-wisdom-and-hope/|5.0|Joe Tangari

At some point in time, just prior to a trip to Paris, I
    managed to learn enough garbled individual phrases to order food, get the check,
    and ask for the bathroom. Embarrassed at my lack of linguistic skill, I spent
    most of my trip to France a deaf-mute. Since then, Francophone friends have put
    forth considerable effort into my mastery of the tongue, but all was largely for
    naught. I remain a linguistic idiot, confined to English and occasional vague
    memories of high school Latin class.</p><p>
    
    So, for me, a new Julie Doiron album in English is a good thing. Despite the
    ethereal beauty of <i>Desormais</i>, I could never shrug off the feeling that
    certain things were lost in translation. Doiron's music is painfully intimate,
    and the distance invoked by the language barrier almost made me feel like I didn't
    deserve to hear what she had to say.  <i>Heart and Crime</i> now falls immediately
    on the heels of <i>Desormais</i>.  And like its predecessor it relies heavily on a
    spare finger-picked style, adding little instrumentation aside from Doiron's vocals,
    her guitar, and an occasional burst of trumpet, piano, organ or drums.</p><p>
    
    What separates Doiron from Chan Marshall, Edith Frost, and other such sad chanteuses,
    is not easy to express. It has to do with the way Doiron breaks down barriers
    between listeners and herself. In part, this results from the warmth of her vocal
    quality, assisted by a clever recording style which creates the illusion that
    Doiron is literally murmuring into your ear. This mode lends credibility to lines
    like the ones in ""Sending the Photograph,"" when she refrains with, ""He's the best
    thing to happen to me/ And I'm the best thing for him.""  An unremarkable lyric on
    paper, sure, but there is conviction in Doiron's voice-- enough to make you believe
    that <i>she</i> believes, whether or not the song is fiction or based on life
    experience.  And it gains greater weight with the sincerity and deftness of her
    musical accompaniment.</p><p>
    
    The album maintains a tenuous relationship to chamber-pop in its occasional
    integration of jazzy instrumentation. The lone trumpet line in ""Shivers""
    complements the union between Doiron's muted guitar style and her vocal technique,
    evoking a more sophisticated uptown sound.  And though the sparseness is affecting,
    most of the best tracks on this album feature small doses of other instruments,
    whether it's the piano on ""The Surgery Is Over"" or the harmonica in ""All Their
    Broken Hearts.""</p><p>
<i>Heart and Crime</i> is pretty sensual stuff. Too sad, perhaps, to qualify as
    ""sexy,"" but ideal for solitude. There's something comfortable about this album--
    slow and soft and effortlessly listenable.  Perhaps it's that Doiron never
    sounds as if she's got anything to prove. No textbook studies of morbid depression
    and incipient madness, no moments of screaming catharsis.  And it's good to know
    that singer/songwriters can still maintain that sort of no-frills approach without
    string sections and concept album style narrative.  If nothing else, this is a
    significant measure of her skill.</p><p>
    
    That being said, I'm not predisposed to distrusting mellow music, and the relative
    simplicity is an undeniable asset.  But this is not an album that will grab you in
    a roomful of people. Doiron provides the listener with a fair amount of created
    mood and atmosphere, but there's not a lot of variation song to song. She lets you
    in immediately, but it's your responsibility to listen closely to what she has to
    say.  And this could become pleasant background noise with the slightest amount of
    effort.  That all the songs maintain roughly the same tempo and almost the same
    key is even more noticeable on the second half of the album, which starts to drag
    a bit somewhere around ""Who Will Be the One,"" a guitar-and-voice-only track.  This
    precedes two others, ""The One You Love"" and the (ironically?) titled ""I Love to
    Dance,"" which sound strikingly similar.</p><p>
<i>Heart and Crime</i> works particularly well as an English companion piece to
    <i>Desormais</i>. The closeness of the release dates and the overall similarities
    between the two albums seem hardly coincidental.  But, linguistic challenges aside,
    <i>Heart and Crime</i> doesn't improve much upon its predecessor, and I wonder if
    it would have achieved greater effect as the second half of a double album.  Idle
    speculation, perhaps. Or a more polite way of saying, ""Good, but not quite as good
    as I wanted it to be.""</p></div>"|2405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2405-heart-and-crime/|7.6|Alison Fields

    Lone Swordsman followed last year with the obligatory remix collection. Credit is
    due for avoiding calling on a diverse cast, mostly of relative unknowns, who take
    liberties with the source material. Some tracks here incorporate guitar and
    vocals, while others push the neo-electro of <i>Tiny Reminders</i> into hardcore
    glitch territory, and there's a lot of room between those two poles.</p><p>
    
    Four tracks in particular stand out from the rest of <i>Further Reminders</i>
    because they take a small dollop of the original album and place it in a
    traditional instrumental setting, essentially creating a new song with faint
    echoes of Two Lone Swordsman intact. Two separate versions of ""Tiny Reminder No.
    1"" by C-Pij (isn't this a label and not a band?) start and end the record. The
    first take assembles the digital gurgles of the original track, while C-Pij add
    a fingerpicked acoustic guitar, organ, and assorted keyboards to create a moving
    little track that almost seems like latter-era Swans. The track is enhanced
    further on the C-Pij ""vocal mix"" that closes the album, as the same instrumental
    backing is used behind a singer who sounds a bit like Hope Sandoval.</p><p>
    
    Morr Music faves Lali Puna take ""It's Not the Worst I've Looked... Just the Most
    I've Ever Cared"" (a track that was pretty close to rock in its original incarnation),
    dress it up with vocals and some ghostly organ drones, and manage to improve the
    track immensely. Calexico's remix of ""Tiny Reminder No. 3"" takes the low-level
    static of the original and weaves it into a new composition in their usual style,
    with a muted trumpet, some nylon-stringed guitars, and loose drumming. Though the
    attempt at fusion is commendable, the result sounds half-assed, like Calexico
    merely dubbed part of the song into a pre-rehearsal warm-up jam.</p><p>
    
    Once you get past the band tracks, which are a mixed bag but nonetheless all a
    bit unusual, the rest of <i>Tiny Reminders</i> feels very familiar. As is often
    the case on remix records, one of the highlights turns out to be by the artists
    themselves. This Two Lone Swordsman version of ""Rotting Hill Carnival"" is a
    clever inversion of the peppy original, moving the focus away from the busy
    snares to the bottom end and transforming the electro-pop sheen into bare-bones
    techno. Cause takes an even more floor-friendly approach to the track, adding
    some house spicing to the skeletal sources. My favorite of the more standard
    electronic remixes is the Dry &amp; Heavy remix of ""Neuflex,"" which also happened to
    be my favorite track on <i>Tiny Reminders</i>. The slow reggae rhythm has a stiff
    but earnest gait that reminds me of Ras Command, and the dub processing of the
    original's unforgettable sequencer riff blends nicely into this spliffed-out
    space.</p><p>
    
    But even as remix records go, <i>Further Reminders</i> is a bit of a disappointment.
    Part of it could have to do with just how much I enjoyed both the tracks and the
    sequencing of the original release. Hearing them picked apart and haphazardly
    scattered like this is disconcerting. But the real problem is that there are
    so few standouts. Serious fans will need <i>Further Reminders</i>, of course, but
    more casual listeners would be better served by a deeper dig into the Two Lone
    Swordsman back catalog.</p></div>"|8225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8225-further-reminders/|6.3|Mark Richard-San

    And there are times on her new album when all you really hear is that voice.  The
    album's first single, ""The Storm,"" may be her best ever vocal performance: the
    lines unfold like a bridge spanning a river.  Majestic yet varied, she can sound
    so real-- a stark jolt, a breathy pause-- that the high points become that much
    more angelic.  And she still writes those weird but powerful lyrics: ""You have
    carbonated my bloodstream"" is freakishly romantic, followed by the strength in
    vulnerability of ""when I stumble, it will be under your spell""-- the chorus then
    yielding to a stretched note that drifts like clouds on a cold Halloween night.</p><p>
    
    There is a band on this album, but it's just an expensive, perfect frame that you
    put around the picture-- it's best when least noticed.  And that's one of the
    problems with <i>Beautysleep</i>.  Five years have passed since Donelly's last
    album-- the poppier but less consistent <i>Lovesongs for Underdogs</i>-- and she
    has put down her guitar for now, leaving almost all axe duties to her husband
    Dean Fisher.  Fisher and the others are like studio session players for a country
    singer: simpatico but anonymous.  There are nice touches to the album's sound,
    like the perfectly moody organ on ""Life Is But a Dream.""  But I had to look at
    the liner notes to find out that the deep voice shadowing ""Moonbeam Monkey"" belongs
    to the late, great Mark Sandman from Morphine.  This duet between Boston's greatest
    high and low voices is a milestone, but it would be nice if Sandman were easier to
    hear.</p><p>
    
    Donelly gives us some menacing and bizarre songs, such as ""Moonbeam Monkey"" or
    ""Wrap-Around Skirt""-- ""This world is a fickle young girl/ It's high time we
    married her off/ How about to gassy old Jupiter.""  Sure, why not?  But at its
    least energetic, it falls into ""adult alternative"" territory: it's not background
    music, but it could be treated that way.  Donelly is extremely, consistently happy
    on <i>Beautysleep</i>, and it may take a few listens to single out and sink into
    ""Another Moment,"" or the erotic home and hearth (and killer chorus) of ""The Wave"";
    and while ""Keeping You"" is a strong single, it feels like another victory lap on
    an album that already has several.  The joy of domesticity warms some great moments:
    that opening heartbeat that reminds us of Donelly's motherhood, or the assurance
    of ""The Night You Saved My Life"": ""Now I sit with my babe at my breast/ I was never
    this good at my best/ Never higher.""  But by the third or fourth ballad, she's
    made her point.</p><p>
    
    Part of me misses her guitarwork.  But I can accept that the album has a calmer
    sound-- and anyway, so few of you bought Belly's criminally underrecognized second
    album, <i>King</i>, that you can grab it now and compensate for <i>Beautysleep</i>'s
    lack of hypercatchy pop gems (though ""The Night You Saved My Life"" is a hard one
    to resist).  Her decision not to rock doesn't mark this album down: <i>Beautysleep</i>'s
    weakness is that so many songs are pretty instead of awe-inspiring-- that she gives
    us only a little greatness.  That naked, breathless intimacy on ""The Storm""-- as
    she reaches for the words ""can it be...""-- is unbelievably gorgeous.  In those
    moments, it's clear that she has elevated herself to a new stage of her career.
    If only this album could consist only of those moments.</p></div>"|2417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2417-beautysleep/|6.9|Chris Dahlen

    mention her stand-up alter-ego, Sheila, an extremely self-conscious social outcast
    who wears coke-bottle glasses and a neckbrace. Some are thrown off by the comedy
    act, especially juxtaposed with Rosie's otherwise earnest and passionate stage
    show. But me, I find it adorable. In all honesty, I find <i>Rosie Thomas</i>
    adorable. I get a tingle just thinking of her. Rosie, if you're out there, I love
    you. Now make me babies.</p><p>
    
    Have I said too much?  Okay, since the cat's out of the bag, I'll just admit it.
    At 25 years of age, I have a crush on someone I've never met (although Rosie must
    share my affections: I also have a non-sexual man-crush on Brad Pitt). Rosie won
    me over at a concert last fall, when all I knew of the young songstress was that
    she'd made a cameo appearance on Damien Jurado's ""Parking Lot"" (off <i>Ghost of
    David</i>). I didn't like the tune that much, but recognizing her association with
    Jurado's low-key, honest folk-pop, I felt I couldn't lose.</p><p>
    
    In the final analysis, I lost two things: jack and shit. The show was amazing,
    really, a reminder that some indie rockers can actually sing.  Rosie's voice is
    stunning-- a delicate timbre, a beautiful hushed passion, with the requisite
    lung-power when she needs to drive home a melody. If singing range were a climbing
    rope, Rosie would ring the bell, and ring it often. To hit the high notes, Thomas
    employs a gorgeous (and apparent) transition to falsetto. You can tell she likes
    that shift, and the falsetto itself, as a number of the tunes on her album make
    that vocal acrobatic a prominent part of the melody (e.g. ""Lorraine""). Moreover,
    in concert, Thomas obviously had a keen sense of dynamics-- during the quieter
    moments it became clear that, except for Thomas, the venue was in utter silence,
    captivated.</p><p>
    
    Until she releases another album, however, I must romanticize my love for Rosie.
    The soundtrack to my dreams will encompass only a few of the songs on <i>When We
    Were Small</i>, notably ""Farewell"" and ""Bicycle Tricycle,"" the most sparse and
    fragile. I like to imagine Rosie alone on stage with a piano, a guitar, and
    otherwise utter silence. Her sparse compositions reveal a stunning vulnerability,
    her voice allowed the full measure of its expressiveness. An album with ten tracks
    of that sort of pure, barren indie-folk would be spellbinding.</p><p>
    
    It's not unfortunate so much as it is just a fact, but much of the rest of the
    album is more pedestrian, weighing in with melodies and compositions that tend
    towards the ""pop"" end of the folk-pop spectrum.  Like ""Finish Line,"" for example,
    which harks of Sarah McLachlan, or the darker ""I Run,"" which features a hackneyed
    melody and orchestration that fails to sell the mood (not to mention that the
    repeated lyrics ""I run far from you"" are a tad weak). None of it ramps up the
    tempo much, or adds density to the mix-- it's not bad stuff, just somewhat
    unexceptional.</p><p>
    
    There are some who will fall in love with this album. Others will fall asleep to
    it. Both will agree that it's a solid debut, long on talent but maybe a bit short
    on melody or lacking in appropriate production. I had big expectations, some of
    which were met, but others of which were disappointed. Nonetheless, I remain
    devoted. Now make me babies.</p></div>"|8020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8020-when-we-were-small/|7.3|Brad Haywood

    himself.""  By day Aalsteinn Gumundsson (for Yagya is he) taps away at code and
    virtual logic gates.  But by night, he and his computers attempt to ""reflect the
    beauty of the world.""  And I hear tell that there's a lot of beauty up there in
    Iceland. It snows a lot and there's plenty of precipitation and wind. Not everyone
    finds such things beautiful, though there is something inviting in Gumundsson's
    drony representation of drizzle, sleet, and ice.  But I have to break up my
    lovefest because, while nice enough in exectuion, <i>Rhythm of Snow</i> is an
    imitation (albeit a faultless one) of Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project.</p><p>
    
    Both Voigt and Gumundsson expertly arrange natural ambient sounds (wind, rustling
    leaves, rain) and weave dulcet melodies through nature's soft white noise.
    Gumundsson has divided the seventy-eight minutes of <i>Rhythm of Snow</i> into
    ten sections, all titled ""Snowflake.""  While I'm uneasy about a rain shower being
    called a snowflake (a rain shower is the central motif of multiple ""Snowflake[s]"")
    the fact that Gumundsson has titled his tracks identically is fitting, because
    they pretty much <i>are</i> identical, apart from microscopic differences in size
    and shape.</p><p>
    
    ""Snowflake 8"" pushes the rain shower sounds of ""Snowflake 7"" further back in the
    mix and brings forward a Rhythm and Sound digital skank. ""Snowflake 4"" incorporates
    micro-house clicks and hiss but backs them up with a formidable warping groove
    that Detroit's Ion would badmouth DJ Assault's ghetto-tech for.  The most dynamic
    of the snowflakes, ""Snowflake 5,"" bears a deep house bassline that sustains the
    same Mellotron ""aahs"" that the Orb used at the beginning of ""A Huge Ever Growing
    Pulsating Brain."" ""Snowflake 6"" pads out nine minutes with cricket chirrups and a
    dulled kickdrum for low-end action.  ""Snowflake 9"" is much more lugubrious, all
    but discarding the kickdrum that sounds increasingly redundant as the album
    progresses.</p><p>
    
    Much of <i>Rhythm of Snow</i> is interchangeable. Gumundsson shows that he can
    riff on other musicians' themes.  But if you're in the right mood (whether
    pharmaceutically, or whether your brainwaves are flattening out in preparedness
    to slip into the arms of Morpheus), you can't beat this stuff. At seventy-eight
    minutes, even the most cranked-up speed-freak would be lulled into the realm of
    dreams. However, judged only by <i>Rhythm of Snow</i>, Gumundsson certainly hasn't
    exhibited the range of style that Wolfgang Voigt has shown. As well as this type
    of soft beat, Voigt has produced crazy acid, house, and synth homages to Marc
    Bolan.  <i>Rhythm of Snow</i> is as a commendable a starting place as any, but
    Gumundsson will have to release very different, original material if he's not
    going to melt swiftly away from collective memory.</p></div>"|8895.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8895-rhythm-of-snow/|6.5|Paul Cooper

    large, I am biased against live albums.  I like going to shows and experiencing
    music live, but hearing that same experience on a disc loses something in the
    translation for me.  I should mention that I'm talking about rock and pop live
    albums-- obviously, styles like jazz rely on the spontaneity of a live performance
    to be effective; even most jazz studio albums are performed in live takes.  Maybe
    it's just my love of production and the completeness that truly great studio
    records have, or the fact that a lot of bands don't do much to distance their
    performances from the studio versions of their songs, but live albums usually go
    back on the shelf after one or two listens, never to be heard from again in my
    house.</p><p>
    
    I'm not sure if I'd call this Echo and the Bunnymen live record an exception to
    that rule-- I definitely enjoy their studio material more-- but I can say that
    I've been spinning <i>Live in Liverpool</i> on a pretty regular basis since it
    arrived in the mail, and as live albums go, it's a pretty impressive showing. Now
    a duo consisting of Ian McCulloch and Will Sergeant, the Bunnymen have assembled
    an able, muscular backing band and chosen a set list that gathers songs from
    throughout their career for what amounts essentially to a fantastic live career
    retrospective.</p><p>
    
    Most of the versions presented by the band here faithfully recall the songs'
    original incarnations, and longtime fans should be more than pleased with what
    they hear.  Echo and the Bunnymen are one of only a handful of older bands out
    there who haven't really lost any of their vitality, and these performances
    bristle with the enthusiasm and energy of a much younger band.  When the guys
    dip into their post-reunion catalog, it often sounds a great deal more charged
    than those songs' studio counterparts.</p><p>
    
    That's especially true of the three tracks taken from last year's <i>Flowers</i>,
    an album that saw them returning to their dark post-punk roots.  They take
    ""Eternity Turns"" at breakneck speed, but McCulloch's voice is clear and even
    throughout the song, and Sergeant's heavily effected guitar work is simply
    sterling.  ""King of Kings"" is even more psychedelicized here than on the album,
    with Sergeant throwing up scudding clouds of guitar to offset McCulloch and the
    band's stable delivery.  The band also tackles ""Buried Alive"" and ""Supermellow
    Man"" from that album in spirited versions that rival the originals in terms of
    sheer charisma.</p><p>
    
    Aside from a somewhat lackluster rendition of ""Nothing Lasts Forever,"" from 1997's
    <i>Evergreen</i>, the band sticks to some of the best songs of their 80s heyday,
    drawing at least one from every album they released in their original incarnation
    as a quartet.  Expectedly, ""Ocean Rain"" figures the most prominently, with fully
    amped versions of ""Seven Seas"" and ""My Kingdom"" and a propulsive reading of ""The
    Killing Moon"" confirming that album's timelessness.  The slow take on ""Ocean Rain""
    that closes the album is unfortunately less than exciting, but well delivered
    nonetheless.</p><p>
    
    The two biggest highlights of the album both reach back to the band's 1979 debut,
    <i>Crocodiles</i>.  The band rips and snorts its way through ""All That Jazz"" with
    both Sergeant and McCulloch tearing into their guitars while some hired heads
    bash out the rhythmic backing with abandon. ""Rescue"" opens things in a similarly
    pounding fashion, and the cheering audience knows exactly what to expect when
    Sergeant lays into the massive guitar lick that kicks the song off.  McCulloch's
    voice warms into the song a bit, but by the end, he's belting out the words as
    loudly as ever.</p><p>
    
    Another early peak is the single ""Never Stop,"" a song that never made its way onto
    any of the band's proper albums, but proves to be one of their best with its loose,
    Police-y groove and sweeping chorus.  <i>Live in Liverpool</i>'s climax comes with
    ""Zimbo,"" a retitled version of ""All My Colours"" from the band's sophomore effort,
    <i>Heaven Up Here</i>.  This is one of the few songs that's actually significantly
    rearranged, but the band nonetheless manages to capture the apocalyptic slow burn
    of the original.</p><p>
    
    Admirably, the band have chosen to include two versions of songs from 1983's
    trippy, experimental <i>Porcupine</i>, which is widely regarded as their most
    difficult record (it's also one of their best).  The version of ""Back of Love"" is
    amazing, bursting with post-punk fury and Sergeant's gravity-defying guitar
    playing.  ""The Cutter,"" though not quite as frantic, reads similarly well, as
    McCulloch's vocals are at their best, booming on the tense chorus and cutting
    straight through Sergeant's spastic outbursts with ease.</p><p>
    
    So, in the end, there's not a whole lot to complain about on this disc.  The
    performances are uniformly great, the set list draws on a lot of their best
    material, and the recording is crystal clear (though occasionally there's a
    bit of hiss from the crowd microphone).  I suppose it would have been nicer
    if the album was all taken from a single performance-- the tracks are selected
    from two August 2001 shows at the Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts'
    Paul McCartney Auditorium-- as it's nice to hear live recordings in the context
    of one complete show.  But that's a minor gripe.  The band manage a strong
    consistency of mood and performance acumen, which is what's really important when
    you're listening at home.</p><p>
    
    Suffice to say, fans of Echo and the Bunnymen should check this out-- it will not
    disappoint.  As for neophytes, I suppose it depends largely on how biased you are
    for or against live albums.  If you're an audiophile or an album person, you may
    want to start with <i>Ocean Rain</i> or <i>Crocodiles</i>, but if you're just
    looking for a good overview of the band's career and some strong performances,
    this could be the place.  Either way, <i>Live in Liverpool</i> is one of those
    rare live albums that keeps me coming back, and there's a lot to be said for
    that.</p></div>"|2668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2668-live-in-liverpool/|7.9|Joe Tangari

They form like Voltron, and I'm
    supposed to piece out this puzzle.  Each MC has like three alternate personalities,
    multiplying the angles of attack.  But <i>Iron Flag</i> gives me an approach: it's
    the most solid Wu album in years.  I guess the Clan wanted to slice through rumors
    that they were falling off, because they holed up at the Wu mansion and punched
    out twelve solid cuts.  First they feint with ""In the Hood,"" for once an intro
    that's listenable.  It's RZA's panoramic sweep from freestyle diss to jump-up
    anthem, with brass blasting and glocks clicking in the background.  Then the
    segue to ""Rules,"" which opens with Ghostface Killah just like on <i>36 Chambers</i>.
    Piano jabs keep a tight rhythm as he belts, ""Who the fuck knocked our buildings
    down/ Who the man behind the World Trade massacres, step up now!""</p><p>
    
    Ghost gets his in, but of course Method Man gets more, taunting, ""Who y'all kiddin'?
    Tryin' to act like my shoe fittin'/ Confused with your head up your ass like who's
    shittin'?""  Still, it's weird to hear him up in the chorus asking, ""How the fuck
    did we get so cool, man?""  We know it, Meth, you don't gotta say it.  But it's
    obvious the Wu wanted the sharpest tongues in the front because he's all over
    <i>Iron Flag</i>, as are Ghost, Raekwon and a surprisingly on-point Inspecta Deck.
    On the opposite, Ol' Dirty Bastard's conspicuously absent, doing time for crack
    possession and fleeing probation.  If anything, the Clan's more cohesive without
    the presence of that chaotic God.  They're all in together now on ""Uzi (Pinky
    Ring),"" the prototype single where every head gets a verse.</p><p>
    
    The RZA's clearly on to some old-school flavor, and it's a lovely thing because it
    makes each song perfect for cruising.  There's horn samples lacing most tracks,
    bringing an upbeat, playful vibe-- despite the dirges, Rakeem knows how to have a
    good time.  ""Chrome Wheels"" drops these nasty mechanical squiggles that combine
    and interlock with bumping bass.  I thought I'd dread the day that divas came to
    the Wu, but Madame D begs, ""Bang us in your cars, bang us in your Jeeps, bang
    that shit retarded,"" and it's far from R&amp;B; (""Rapping Bullshit,"" per RZA parlance).
    Even the tracks he farms out to Wu-Tang Incorp. affiliates thump hard.  ""One of
    These Days"" rolls on funk guitars and a blunt beat courtesy of Nick ""Fury"" Loftin;
    the southern-playa-listic Cadillac music keeps U-God from ruining it when he's
    mumbling about being ""so unique"" and then wanting out of the Clan (?!).</p><p>
    
    But U-God redeems with his verse on ""Soul Power,"" where he sketches the best
    vignette: ""Crack a Coca-Cola, summer heat was my boredom/ Dr. J before Jordan,
    Al Green on the organ.""  Flavor Flav provides the shout-out chorus, and he's
    kidding around with Meth at the end, talking about family in Long Island.
    Lyrically the Wu are much more earthy on <i>Iron Flag</i>-- maybe the
    ""thousand-dollar lesbians"" weren't catching many fans?  Likewise, there's about
    five percent of the Five Percent, though GZA of course drops his characteristic
    science.  You don't get much introspection, just grandstanding like on ""Y'all
    Been Warned,"" where RZA digs, ""You can't Etch-a-Sketch all my rhyme threat/ Try to
    bite my flow, you catch ya throat step.""  The only time they return to the
    languorous street noir of tracks like ""C.R.E.A.M."" is on ""Babies,"" a grim
    Raekwon/Ghostface tale about a crooked cop.</p><p>
    
    The title track is the lone downtempo diversion.  The needle scratches and the
    synths blow like wind before the music descends into ""The Glock,"" a subsection
    with little more than a percussion loop rumbling and the Clan gathered round
    shouting into the mic.  It comes across real cold, but then ""Dashing"" ends the
    album with Deck singing nursery rhymes; GZA leaves behind a smooth verse James
    Bond-style before he disappears.  With all the catchy choruses, each song on
    <i>Iron Flag</i> hits like another single to be released.  The kung-fu samples
    are back, Masta Killa's still trying to carve out a name for himself, and the Wu
    prove they never need guests like Snoop or Isaac Hayes to throw down a strong
    joint.  It's an album about brotherhood, fueled by the national war but no doubt
    sparked on a more personal level.  As Method Man deadpans on ""Uzi,"" ""Give you the
    same advice that I gave my wife: don't fuck with mine.""  Damn.</p></div>"|8746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8746-iron-flag/|7.5|Christopher Dare

Yuji Oniki sounds like the male version of Natalie Imbruglia.
    Now I realize that's a pretty strong thing to say about someone whom most people
    are unfamiliar with, and because I still have some feeling left for struggling
    artists, I thought twice about the comparison.  Nevertheless, the only other
    reason I can see not to compare Oniki with the frail adult contemporary demon is
    that his production isn't quite as good.  Also, he doesn't seem to have her knack
    of sounding tortured and generally malnourished-- so, hopefully he's got health
    on his side.  Man, this is not starting well.</p><p>
    
    Oniki is based in Oakland, California; most of the record was recorded at his
    house, with a small band.  He then sent the tracks all over the place, including
    to Japan, where Katsui Yuji of Rovo added a little violin, and Sakana's Nishiwaki
    added some guitar.  Next stop for the tapes was Cleveland, where Guided by Voices'
    Doug Gillard tacked on a couple of guitar solos.  Furthermore, Beulah's Bill Swan
    blew his horn (trumpet) to flesh out some of the arrangements.  Initially, this
    seems to be a neat concept in making a ""solo"" record, because the resulting sound
    should reflect more than just the idiosyncratic vision of the writer.  However, in
    practice, this is basically just Oniki roping in his favorite session players,
    which isn't that different from what, say, Donald Fagan does.  And what's so great
    about that?</p><p>
    
    Other than the fact that I'm not terribly fond of the music Oniki brings to mind,
    the real issue is that I'm not all that fond of Oniki's music.  I will say that,
    as a pop auteur (he wrote, produced and arranged all of the music on <i>Tvi</i>),
    he gets points for the understated (some might say simple) arrangements, and
    overwhelmingly straightforward, melodic tunes.  We may have seen the last days of
    pop artists who have ProTools at their fingertips, and yet don't produce whacked-out
    electronic pieces or acid-damaged Beatles homages.  Oniki certainly seems to be
    aiming for AOR heaven here, and I guess props are in order for him sticking to his
    guns.  So, yeah.</p><p>
    
    Some of the tunes are nice: the opener ""40 Seconds"" is a good showcase for Yuji's
    sometimes nasal, rarely very expressive, but generally strong tenor.  It takes a
    lazy groove, and adds a pinch of spacy reverb, distant violin, and some acoustic
    guitar, making for a pleasant, dreamy backdrop.  ""Skeleton Station"" is a short,
    piano instrumental, and a very nice accompaniment to staring out the window into
    the rain.  ""Reminders"" is something of a torch song, with a brooding chord
    progression and a relatively expansive arrangement (mellotron strings, soaring
    background vocals, shimmering electric guitar) that actually turns the tune into
    something like the younger cousin of Blur's ""Universal.""</p><p>
    
    However, the majority of music on <i>Tvi</i> isn't that distinct: the low-key drama
    of ""One Bright Summer Day,"" with an energy level that stays constant (approaching
    comatose) for far too long; the upbeat ""Transport,"" with its perky college beat
    and peppy ""ba-da-bop"" backing vocals, threatens to dethrone the Rembrandts as the
    kings of annoyingly passive pop; ""Between Beds and Clocks"" is almost as cute as
    Imbruglia, but then again, Oniki's not a hot ex-soap star, so there shouldn't be
    any way he gets away with being this twee.  If light, faintly emotional pop is
    your thing, by all means check this record out.  I could see it appealing to the
    over-stressed, no-time-for-noise crowd, but even then, I'd take something tougher--
    I hear Kylie Minogue is back.</p></div>"|6008.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6008-tvi/|5.0|Dominique Leone

Most of the major figures in jazz     spent their late teens and early 20s apprenticing with bands led by veterans eager     to surround themselves with young players, such as those run by Art Blakey, Dizzy     Gillespie, Horace Silver, and Miles Davis. Coleman's early development as a soloist     and composer, on the other hand, can only be a matter of speculation.  Because     Coleman's unusual ideas about music had difficulty finding in a foothold in the     post-bop jazz world of the mid-to-late 50s, he had a late start with recording.     And so, the first record he appeared on was one issued under his own name: 1958's     <i>Something Else!</i> He was 28 at the time.</p>
<p>Coleman's debut stands out in his discography not because of its quality, but     because the record features a piano. Coleman was a self-taught student of music     who entered the arena with a beef against jazz: he felt that chords exerted an     undue influence over improvisation and limited a player's expression. Striving     to improvise with greater melodic freedom, Coleman ditched the piano for his     second album, <i>Tomorrow Is the Question</i>. Signing with Atlantic in 1959,     Coleman obtained a higher profile (and generated controversy) with releases     including <i>The Shape of Jazz to Come</i> and <i>Change of the Century</i>, all     leading up to the 1960 double-quartet release that coined a movement, <i>Free     Jazz</i>.</p>
<p>Look again at the titles of these early releases: <i>The Shape of Jazz to Come</i>,     <i>Change of the Century</i>, <i>Free Jazz</i>. One imagines Coleman as a     self-confident visionary aware of his effect on the world of music. The title of     this recently reissued album provided a similar challenge to the populace: ""This     is our music,"" Coleman might have been saying. ""Are you going to listen?""     Originally released in 1960 (the last Quartet record before the <i>Free Jazz</i> session), <i>This Is Our Music</i> features Coleman on alto, Don Cherry on trumpet,     Charlie Haden on bass, and Ed Blackwell on drums. What amazes me about this era of     Coleman, especially in light of the literature surrounding it, is how accessible     it is.  Back in the day, this band had the intelligentsia calling for Coleman to     be fitted for a straightjacket, but to one weaned on the 60s Impulse! catalog, the     music sounds joyous, pretty, sensible and sane.</p>
<p>The uptempo tracks here are teeming with life.  On ""Blues Connotation"" and ""Folk     Tale"" the band sounds ""in the moment"" and brimming with ideas, as if these four-     and five-minute compositions are far too brief to ever contain them all. The     sporadic surges in tempo are early experiments in elastic time (a trend that would     be explored at great length as the 60s progressed), and these bursts of energy     make these pieces seem, well, <i>bountiful</i>. Also adding to the loose sense of     fun on tracks like ""Poise"" is the interplay between Coleman and Cherry. At times,     they seem to be chasing each other around the tune, while other moments find them     doing a modern take on the call-and-response ensemble soling of Dixieland. Despite     the occasional rubbery rhythmic passage and playful tone, all the faster pieces     here swing in the fullest sense of the word, with Blackwell and Haden's pulse set     firmly in the tradition.</p>
<p>If the faster tracks on <i>This Is Our Music</i> come across as buoyant and almost     pop, the more drawn-out pieces are mysterious and pleasantly disorienting. ""Beauty     Is a Rare Thing"" is drifting and impressionistic, with Blackwell's drums and Haden's     bowed bass used for color and shading instead of rhythm. Cherry and Coleman's lines     are not concerned with melody or even pitch, but manage to find expression in a     series of squeaks, groans, and grunts. The Quartet's take on the Gershwin standard     ""Embraceable You"" (the only track not composed by Coleman, and indeed the only     standard he recorded during this period) is necessarily more conventionally tuneful,     but it still moves with a peculiar gait. The theme is familiar, but Blackwell uses     mallets for the drums and barely touches the cymbals, and both Cherry and Coleman     take serious liberties with the melody.</p>
<p>We'll never know what it was like to hear Ornette Coleman in 1959 and 1960, but     there's an upside to encountering music stripped of its context. We can just     <i>listen</i> and not concern ourselves with determining which rules are being     broken. In 1960, people literally wanted to beat the crap out of Ornette Coleman     because of what he was doing to jazz.  But now, his work just sounds exceptionally     fresh and timeless.</p></div>"|1544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1544-this-is-our-music/|9.4|Mark Richard-San

    defense strategy, the Pentagon today unveiled plans to resuscitate a controversial
    weapons project that has been neglected for over a decade.</p><p>
    
    ""Ladies and gentleman, tomorrow's battles will not be fought on the ground, in the
    air, or even under the water, but will require entirely new military technology to
    be developed,"" Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced in a press conference
    this morning.  ""To defend ourselves from the increasingly powerful forces of
    terrorism worldwide, we must turn to one of our country's most valuable resources:
    the supergroup.""</p><p>
    
    The American supergroup arsenal has been steadily dwindling in power since the
    late 1960s, when star-studded projects like CSNY and Blind Faith were used as
    a deterrent in the Cold War with the Soviet Union.  Further development of
    supergroup technology occurred during the Reagan Years, focusing mainly upon the
    Traveling Wilburys agenda.  But recent reports have warned that these weapons lie
    mostly in a state of disrepair, with the majority of their components dead, fat,
    and/or balding.  As such, the Pentagon has started from scratch by introducing
    entirely new designs.</p><p>
    
    ""Our first rollout in the new American Supergroup Program is the Long Winters,""
    said Nick Person, Director of Supergroup Strategy for the Department of Defense,
    ""a project being developed at a confidential location somewhere in the Northwestern
    United States.  Many details of this operation are highly classified, but I've
    been authorized to tell you it centers around singer/songwriter John Roderick,
    and features members of the Posies, Built to Spill, Sunny Day Real Estate,
    Fountains of Wayne, and Death Cab for Cutie.""</p><p>
    
    Thomas Zimmermann, founder of the private organization Citizen Supergroup Monitor,
    notes that the announcement of the Long Winters reflects a profound shift in the
    military's use of its supergroup resources.  ""Recent attempts to develop new
    supergroup weaponry involved taking musicians from high-profile groups, like the
    embarrassing failure of the Phish/Primus/Police hybrid, Oysterhead.  Researchers
    found that placing three or more egotistical, renowned musicians in a band
    creates a volatile mixture prone to excessive noodling and horrendously ineffective
    songwriting.  The Long Winters project, by assembling its components from less
    popular but critically lauded bands, indicates a new direction for the Supergroup
    Program.""</p><p>
    
    An anonymous source from inside the Pentagon confirmed this analysis.  ""When Canada
    went public with the New Pornographers last year, it was a big embarrassment for
    the entire military.  We'd always joked about Canada's seemingly negligible
    supergroup capabilities, laughing at the idea of the Canucks combining Bryan
    Adams, Celine Dion, and the bassist from Loverboy.  But when the Canadians tapped
    into their surprisingly rich indie rock resources and released <i>Mass Romantic</i>,
    we were all caught off guard.""</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, when pressed for information during a Pitchfork interview, Death Cab's
    Ben Gibbard refused to directly comment on rumors of his involvement in the Long
    Winters: ""I've never met a lot of those people, we're not comrades or anything,
    we don't play music together."" Despite this denial, inside sources have confirmed
    to this reporter that Mr. Gibbard plays drums on the album's radioactively catchy
    ""Carparts,"" while bandmate Chris Walla lends his quirky production and keyboard
    skills throughout the album.</p><p>
<i>The Worst You Can Do Is Harm</i> is the name of the debut release from the Long
    Winters, and we feel it adequately reflects the considerable strengths of this
    new project,"" Mr. Person explained at today's press conference.  ""Rooted in the
    traditional American country-rock style of Wilco and Clem Snide, developers have
    also added a glaze of poppy harmonies and synthesizer melodies.  With highly
    infectious songs like 'Government Loans' and 'Scent of Lime,' the album has more
    than enough firepower to keep the Axis of Evil states in line.""</p><p>
    
    However, some skeptics temper the government's optimism about the Long Winters
    agenda.  ""The album most definitely has its flaws,"" says Mr. Zimmermann.
    ""Roderick's throaty nicotine vocals really wear thin over the course of ten
    tracks. 'Medicine Cabinet Pirate' and 'Unsalted Butter' are both good songs that
    run too long, and, well, 'Samaritan' and 'Copernicus' are just flat out duds.
    Generally, however, it's a strong first step for the revival of the Supergroup
    Program. I can't get 'Carparts' out of my frickin' head.""</p><p>
    
    But Zimmermann cautions, ""Technically, the Long Winters are not so much a
    supergroup as a collection of Roderick's songs recorded with the assistance of
    his luminous friends in the indie rock world.  By unconditionally labeling them a
    supergroup, it's as if the military were writing a highly conceptual, overly clever
    record review and needed to fudge the details slightly to make an album fit the
    idea.""</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, the American Supergroup Program is once again a top priority of the
    Pentagon.  ""Searches of seized bunkers in Afghanistan show preliminary indications
    that al Qaeda has been developing their own supergroup, purchasing guitarists and
    drummers on the black market from former Soviet Republics,"" said Person.  ""In
    response, we are pursuing Dan the Automator for a high-ranking position in the
    supergroup developmental program, and trying to arrange a resource-sharing
    coalition with England.  By 2003, we project a Thom Yorke/Del tha Funkee
    Homosapien/Will Oldham assembly will be ready for deployment to armed forces

    and novelty.  This takes many forms, from the struggle of producers wishing to
    maintain a semblance of recognition for utilizing old-school techniques, to the
    desire of new MCs to push the boundaries of lyrical delivery.  Recently, this
    shifting between repetition and novelty has reached a manic pace, to the point
    where it seems essential fare for a producer to shout over a track or re-use
    bass sounds and drum patterns to emphasize their signature.  In the advertising
    world, it's called ""branding.""</p><p>
    
    The Neptunes are the reigning kings of beat-branding.  Throughout their best-known
    tracks-- from ""Superthug"" to ""Southern Hospitality""-- some elements have remained
    more or less constant: the bass sound, a gritty, ultimately recyclable sample,
    and the off-time kick/snare combination that seemed revitalize hip-hop for a
    minute.  But that minute has lasted two years, and the same sounds now cross the
    board from Britney Spears to Limp Bizkit.  Shit is getting ugly, and N.E.R.D. is
    the truest testament to this fact.  Quoth the Neptunes: ""<i>In Search Of...</i> seems
    like a bland title, but for us, it's In search of love.  In search of happiness.
    In search of smiling.  In search of that bitch with the big ass.  In search of the
    answer to why my brother smokes crack.  It's all of that; it's about being open.""</p><p>
<i>In Search Of...</i> joins Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo (the Neptunes) with
    hometown friend Shay.  (That hometown, incidentally, is the same Virginia area
    that brought up Timbaland, Missy Elliott, and Teddy Riley.)  This album conceivably
    brings the group back to their ""roots,"" which, in a letter written by Pharrell on
    the group's website, heavily emphasizes the AC/DC side of things.</p><p>
    
    The album has had a relatively tumultuous history-- especially over the last few
    months-- with a domestic release date pushed back by the Neptunes' decision to
    re-record the album with the help of some live instrumentation.  Over a year ago,
    the original version of the album was released and garnered exactly no glowing
    reviews (with the exception of a positive write-up in <i>Rolling Stone</i>).
    Whether or not this was the incentive for the group to re-record is unclear.
    The result, however, is an album's worth of hot-to-death Neptunes hooks and
    bass sounds tainted with the despicable addition of rap-metal drumming and
    distorted guitar posturing.</p><p>
    
    To backtrack a bit, when the ""original"" album came out about a year ago, the first
    single was the ""BET Uncut Video""-worthy ""Lapdance,"" which promised to fulfill
    Pharrell's promised prophecies of hip-hop as revolution via chorus lines like,
    ""The politicians are lookin' like to strippers to me.""  See, Pharrell has been
    talking a lot of shit since the Neptunes began to get some serious props, stressing
    that doing a beat for Jay-Z was a way of ""getting their message out"" to the masses.</p><p>
    
    But somewhere between ""I Jus Wanna Luv U"" and ""Pass the Courvoisier,"" signals got
    crossed.  Pharrell, Chad and Shay took the drum tracks off most of the album, and
    added a drummer who could easily have cut his teeth in a Slipknot cover band.
    While Rap-Metal 101 drums bang away in the background, the basslines are replaced
    by chugging guitar riffs reminiscent of your high school hardcore band.  What
    remains, though, is the exceptional quality of Pharrell's voice, which, unlike
    the bass sound, doesn't lose its intensity due to repeated radio exposure.  The
    lyrics here are mostly decent, too, with the exception of ""Brain,"" which, before
    it was re-recorded sounded clever, and now sounds like a frat house anthem.
    ""Provider"" hints at the fact that were Pharrell and Chad born twelve years ago,
    they'd be bumping this album along with Kid Rock's <i>Cocky</i>.</p><p>
    
    One of the greatest benefits of being multi-million dollar producers is having
    access to recording equipment that will make your sounds even more super-flawless.
    This, coupled with the Neptunes' five years of hitmaking experience, make for a
    ""well-produced"" album, which generally doesn't mean shit to me.  Chalk it up to
    an oversight on the part of N.E.R.D.  And their acronym speaks the truth, and No
    one Ever Really Dies, maybe we'll get our hands on a third, less compromised
    version of the album, where the drummer has been fired and the guitar is being
    used to prop up the reconstituted drum machines.</p></div>"|5748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5748-in-search-of/|6.0|Michael Bernstein

    the polite way to say that, upon first listen, they sound unremarkable or even
    irritating.  The latest release by Bloomington, Indiana's Brando, <i>Single Crown
    Postcard</i>, provoked immediate dislike that slowly grew into a genuine respect.
    This is a complicated album, straightforward in small doses but hard to interpret
    as a whole.</p><p>
    
    Start with the sound quality.  Brando makes the most of their four-track recordings,
    but maybe the format shouldn't be pushed this far.  Home taping can be kind to
    straight-up rock and solo bedroom confessional records, but Brando's arrangements
    are much more complicated: the band parts are tight and precise, with primary
    songwriter and performer Derek Richey layering lush sounds and synthesized string
    backdrops.  Shoehorning all of this into a four-track can sound like taping music
    off the TV by holding a cassette recorder to the speaker: the result is weak and
    distant when you want to hear it soar.</p><p>
    
    And there's Richey's vocals.  He's a good singer-- on key, confident and distinct--
    but his high voice, which resembles David Sedaris', is an acquired taste.  His
    delivery is so precise and his expression so unvaried that it's hard to tell where
    he's coming from: on the first track, ""French Algiers,"" he's almost apologetic
    (""I've got more game than it appears,"" he assures us), but on other songs, he
    sounds more bold and assertive, bordering on snarky.</p><p>
    
    It's after a couple of listens that the strength and diversity of the songwriting
    comes through: <i>Single Crown Postcard</i> is a mess of classic pop styles.
    ""Partisan"" echoes whimsical late-60s Brit-pop, with its biting yet sing-song
    lyrics.  ""By and By"" could have shown up on a Dusty Springfield album, and Richey
    forces some genuine soul out of his voice.  Other songs borrow from more modern
    styles: the piano line on ""Driving to My Desert"" could have come off the soundtrack
    to a Hal Hartley film, and ""The Great Unwind"" cribs from every wistful indie pop
    song of the past ten years, maybe sounding a little more sincere than average when
    you detect some rare vulnerability in Richey's singing.</p><p>
    
    For as much as the songs are clean, solid pop, <i>Single Crown Postcard</i>
    combines them into a hard-to-fathom package: it shifts from somber to psychedelic,
    from the pining of ""Two Views (Of Your Glass Gloves)"" to the oompa-loompa gait and
    twinkly keyboards of ""Two Years.""  A simpler album would be taken at face value,
    but Richey gives up so little of his intentions and opinions that he almost dares
    you to keep listening and digging in.  I don't know what the hell he's really
    singing about, but it's starting to sound pretty interesting.</p></div>"|912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/912-single-crown-postcard/|6.8|Chris Dahlen

    moors, bouts of depression lit afire with trance, and trash can percussion-- not
    to mention more than an ounce of poetic pretense.  But of course, when was emotional
    music supposed to deliver anything more weighty?  It's very contagious, and I can
    hope that was the intention.  Truthfully, I have no idea how or why this mysterious
    Italian band made this music.  Furthermore, I'm not alone in this.</p><p>
    Last year, Swans founder Michael Gira (and Young God Records chief) started getting
    odd packages from Torino, Italy.  Inside were CD-Rs of sounds compiled, produced
    and otherwise emitted from a band of people known simply as Larsen.  On his
    website, Gira describes the music therein as ranging from soft, accordion-based
    abstractions to ""sometimes just a single sound or noise, a scraping sound, as if
    someone were slowly etching a piece of rusted metal with a blade of some sort.""
    The final package he received had nothing like that, but rather a wad of cash, a
    ticket to Italy, and a request for him to produce an album for Larsen.  And as
    anyone with even a hint of adventure (or sadism) would, Gira accepted the
    invitation.</p><p>
    Upon arriving, Gira was never actually permitted to see the members of Larsen.
    Apparently, he was relegated to the control room as the band, behind a silk
    screen, made music and, when it fancied them, communicated to Gira via translators
    and other strangers.  He speaks of frequent ""heated, violent arguments"" and
    ""watching the shadows"" from behind the cloth barrier, as Larsen played for hours
    on end before deciding it was time to actually start recording.  This is the
    introduction I had before me as I listened to <i>Rever</i>, and never let it be
    said that a band's lore can't be as much a factor in their music as the sounds
    they make.</p><p>
    Now, taken on its own, this record doesn't possess quite as much of the macabre
    as its back story would indicate.  It does come awfully close, though.  Larsen's
    sound has elements of damaged, arty rock from all over.  I can hear lots of Sonic
    Youth-- conceptually, even when it doesn't directly call to mind their music-- in
    the dread-full, repetitive figures and omnipresent guitar noise.  That isn't to
    say that Larsen are necessarily ""noisy,"" but a lot of the playing reminds me of
    similarly tense, rock deconstructions by the American band.  There are also some
    hints of post-rock, though what I really want to say is that Larsen doesn't mind
    taking a groove and running into the ground, all in the name of lulling me into a
    damp, sickly stupor.  Gira calls them ""highly ritualized sounds,"" and if that means
    they're often uncomfortably numbing, I agree.</p><p>
    The opener, ""Impro #2,"" features just such cyclical meandering.  It begins with an
    up-tempo (for Larsen, anyway) march pattern, featuring triangle, accordion and
    lazily strummed, clean electric guitar.  Soon, an unidentified male vocalist
    (musicians include Roberto Maria Clemente, Paolo Dellapiana and Sylvia Grosso,
    though no specific performance info is provided) chants indecipherably, sounding
    like a cross between a Tibetan throat singer and a restrained death metal growler.
    I would call this a mantra if not for the old recording of a trombone which comes
    in at the very end.</p><p>
    The epic ""Radial"" follows, and this is where Larsen really lets its strengths
    shine.  Thunderous reverberations act as fanfare, and a distant accordion waxes
    the floor for the onslaught of distorted bass and guitar which has crept up so
    subtly as to make me wonder how things got so impenetrably loud all of a sudden.
    Someone begins to saw at a zither (or some such piece of arcane craftsmanship) in
    the background, until about four minutes in when the rainstorm softens a bit.
    The bass is still hacking away, but slowly receding to reveal that the accordion
    from the beginning has in fact never stopped moaning.  The track is 11 minutes,
    and Larsen doesn't let on that this was just an introduction, until the ""tune""
    starts at the 5\xBD-minute mark.  At that point, they rip into genuine fuzz-trance,
    Goth-psych-- let's just say that it's gloomier than This Heat, yet punchier than
    late-period Swans.</p><p>
    The fairly brief ""Mentre"" lightens the mood considerably (and the fact that it's
    in a major key tonality helps a ton), and even manages to use the guttural growl
    of the male vocalist as a droning counter-line to the spoken female narration.
    ""Finger Number Six"" tightens the rhythmic arrangement (just sticks and a tom),
    though retains the light electric guitar strum as an accompanying instrument for
    the ultra-minimalist (read: two notes) melody.  During their more experimental
    moments, Larsen might seem to fall into the psych camp, with big, echo-treated
    atmospherics and dark, acid-purified espousals from the unknown singers.  However,
    the beat strategies presented on this tune (and others, like the aggressive
    ""Akin"") often tighten the reins on the group's tendency to spill.</p><p>
    Chiefly, my issue with <i>Rever</i> isn't that the band works up too much lather
    in their mud bath; rather, they only really seem to make one mess, over and over.
    Fifty minutes of brooding, pensive mood music might hit the spot for me on
    occasion, though could be a bit tedious if I'm not up for it.  But at least as
    I write this, it's fairly impressive.  With any luck, Larsen may one day raise
    their black curtain to reveal something frighteningly good.</p></div>"|4692.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4692-rever/|7.9|Dominique Leone

Why does rock lend itself so easily to the
    loons?  Of course, as Ben Watson has pointed out in a recent <i>Wire</i> column,
    there's a big difference between the mentally insane and the popular image of the
    rocker who's come unhinged.  It's the Velvet Goldmine syndrome-- you're offered a
    thrilling sense of transgression, but you're kept safe because it's all objectified
    in the form of some garishly-clad star on stage.  Lady Stardust shows some leg;
    Jim Morrison thinks dark thoughts about his mum; you're fingering the ticket in
    your pocket and nodding along.</p><p>
    
    Somewhere in that haze of drugs, sex and glam lies Marmoset.  Yes, they're from
    Indianapolis of all places, and yes, you will believe that in spite of it all
    when you hear this EP.  ""The Living Illusions"" reflects on late-60s psych-rock
    with lazy chords (two or three at most!) and barebones drum backing.  An organ
    hums as guitarist Dave Jablonski's tenor insists, ""I'm not right in the head/ I
    truly believe I'm not connected upstairs.""  His other main number on the EP, ""I'm
    Always Too Late,"" wanders as whimsically as any of Syd Barrett's spacy old tunes.
    The chorus begins in good nature but somehow, in only three minutes, the strums
    and sing-song repetition add up to something almost unsettlingly obsessive.</p><p>
    
    I focused more on Jorma Whittaker, Marmoset's bassist and other lead singer, in
    my review of their 2001 album <i>Record in Red</i>.  A song by the same name
    appears here on the EP (though not on that album), and it's a distillation of
    their entire lo-fi ethic.  Drummer Jason Cavan sets a swaggering downbeat to the
    buzzy garage-rock guitars, and Whittaker's suddenly insinuating himself onto your
    lap with lines like, ""I came to see you/ Want to know who you are.""  The guy's
    always halfway between flirt and freakout, as on the title track.  Mishawaka is
    apparently a small town near South Bend, Indiana, and in the song of the same
    name, Whittaker's driving alone towards it.  ""The truth is like a rattlesnake/
    I hold it in my arms, satisfy the charms,"" he sings, letting each syllable slip
    off his tongue.  And true to form, the guitar slithers playfully just on the edge
    of tension.</p><p>
    
    What we have here is another twenty minutes of vintage Marmoset, a taste that will
    appeal across lines from Brit-poppers to <i>Nuggets</i> collectors.  The EP is
    rounded out by a cover of the Fourmost's 1963 hit ""I'm in Love,"" penned for them
    by John Lennon and Paul McCartney.  Marmoset's take on Merseybeat is of course
    somewhat subdued, but if anything, it sounds even more genuine than the original.
    Then there's the instrumental ""Soft Evenings,"" placed strangely as the first song.
    It's the longest, just three minutes of the bass pulsing quietly and Whittaker
    cooing strangely.  He sounds both serene and yet vulnerable, and also quite mad.</p><p>
    
    ""Soft Evenings"" clearly rose from a jam, which sparks a thought: maybe that freeform
    mind-state that gets equated with insanity finds itself easily in music because
    of the immediacy of the connection.  It's like painting, where you can slather
    oil directly on canvas, whereas other forms, like film, require preparation.
    Writing is an interesting middle ground, because you can definitely scratch down
    whatever comes to mind-- but in practice, I'd guess there are more Boredoms
    listeners than readers of Burroughs cut-ups.  Still, you did read this review,
    didn't you?</p></div>"|5112.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5112-mishawaka-ep/|7.2|Christopher Dare

    much credence to is the fact that compact discs essentially suck as artifacts. A
    limited-pressing seven-inch, a dusty old slab of vinyl-- these are the kind of
    relics that can be treasured for ages, and can provide that sorely missed goofy
    fanboy sense of connection with an artist.  CDs, on the other hand, reek of mass
    production. Not only is the packaging all secured behind flimsy plastic, but the
    music itself can be reproduced infinitely without any change in quality. Though
    it's handy, bite-sized, and generally convenient, a CD generally doesn't leave you
    with the sense that it's a precious artifact-- a gift straight from the artist to
    you to be appreciated for years to come.</p><p>
    
    But Will Cullen Hart (along with a number of other experimental weirdos like
    Jackie-O Motherfucker and Acid Mothers Temple) aims to change all that.  With the
    Olivia Tremor Control, Hart's wonderful artwork helped make each of that band's
    releases feel like something worth admiring, as well as setting the mood for the
    records themselves. Now, with Cloud Recordings' homemade project, Hart is releasing
    beautifully packaged CD-R's, all made with decidedly analog implements such as
    spray paint and tracing paper. Every Cloud homemade release is unique-- each has
    its own slightly varying artwork, made lovingly by Hart himself and his Athens
    cohorts.</p><p>
    
    Musically, the homemades are similarly intimate-- smaller projects that would
    appeal to people who are particularly in tune with Hart's musical sensibility.
    <i>Inside Views</i>, one in the first series of CD-Rs to be released, is a
    revisitation of the Circulatory System's excellent self-titled debut record.
    Whereas <i>Circulatory System</i> was, in many ways, the most straightforward
    album to be released by Hart yet, <i>Inside Views</i> takes the tracks from that
    album on a <i>Black Foliage</i>-style ride, complete with sound collages and
    abrupt song changes.</p><p>
<i>Circulatory System</i> had nearly infinite sonic material to mine. With some
    songs from that album containing upwards of 60 simultaneous tracks, and countless
    additional tracks not having made it onto the final mix, an almost entirely
    different record could have been assembled from source material. <i>Inside Views</i>
    makes it clear, however, that Hart's intention wasn't to create something entirely
    new, but rather to provide alternate sonic perspectives on an incredibly complex
    record.</p><p>
    
    Over its thirteen untitled tracks, <i>Inside Views</i> covers many of the best
    songs from <i>Circulatory System</i>. Its first track is a sparser interpretation
    of ""Yesterday's World,"" with a slithery guitar line taking the forefront, and a
    more subdued rhythm. This less structured rendering allows Hart to introduce a
    whole new slew of weird, trippy sounds and little cut-up edits of the song.
    Elsewhere, Hart pulls out to focus on some of the most compelling sounds on
    <i>Circulatory System</i> individually-- the deep chanting of ""ancient voices"" on
    ""Outside Blasts"" being the most notable example.</p><p>
    
    Around the tenth track, <i>Inside Views</i> becomes deeply sparse and ambient,
    providing an interesting change of pace from the oft-breakneck sonic exploration
    that precedes it. This period of quiet segues into a skeletal interpretation of
    ""Inside Blasts,"" perhaps the best track on <i>Circulatory System</i>. The whirling
    background drones that were once pushed way back in the mix are audible now, and
    make a prime case for Hart's talent as a creator of incredible, unusual sounds.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, <i>Inside Views</i> succeeds wonderfully in providing some new vistas
    on a brilliant record. By abruptly picking you up in the middle of one song and
    dropping you down in another, Hart shows just how successful he was in creating a
    whole variety of strange environments on <i>Circulatory System</i>. As a stand-alone
    effort, <i>Inside Views</i> is far from stacking up against the body of Hart's
    other work. But as a handmade companion piece to one of last year's most memorable
    albums, it's something to treasure.</p></div>"|1477.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1477-inside-views/|7.9|Matt LeMay

    elitism.  It's been so long since prog was a popular genre that the argument over
    its relevance has seemingly been left by the wayside.  However, there are several
    attitudes we take for granted today that may never have existed outside of the
    general pop-critic population, but seem to have been perpetuated over the past
    thirty years to the point of being distorted and disproportionately trusted.
    Ultimately, that there is a humbly active prog scene today (check the cults of
    oddly named groups such as Spock's Beard or the Flower Kings if you're in doubt)
    might be the funniest anti-climax in rock.  Allow me to shoot down some
    stereotypes:</p><p>
<i>""Prog is pretentious and bloated.""</i></p><p>
    
    Yes, and Emerson, Lake and Palmer are often cited as the prime examples.  While I
    can't defend a couple of those later 70s Yes albums, and the insane clown affair
    that is <i>Pictures at an Exhibition</i>, I will say that at their worst, these
    bands never approached the bombast of the slightest Sex Pistols or Stooges album.</p><p>
<i>""Only Dungeons &amp; Dragons nerds listen to prog.""</i></p><p>
    
    This idea may stem from prog's often-whimsical subject matter or mythical album
    covers, though I have to say that I've never heard a prog tune about the King of
    Carrot Flowers.</p><p>
<i>Prog doesn't rock.""</i></p><p>
    
    ...</p><p>
    
    Despite the superficiality of these kinds of criticisms, many of the original
    bands took them to heart, and by 1977 or so, most of them had receded into crass
    commercialism, or were forced out of the music business entirely due to changing
    trends.  The ones that lived on were generally one of two ilks.  The first was
    the style chameleon: Yes and Genesis are the two most famous examples, with the
    latter band going so far as to allow their frontman to lead them into the worst
    regions of MOR banality.  The second type was the far more interesting proposition:
    bands that graduated from prog into even stranger realms.  Henry Cow was this type
    of band, and what follows may change your perception of prog forever.</p><p>
    
    Henry Cow was founded at Cambridge University, England by guitarist Fred Frith and
    keyboardist/reed player Tim Hodgkinson.  Percussionist Chris Cutler joined in 1971,
    by which time the band had settled into a regular unit.  A diverse mix of influences
    (Zappa, modern classical composition, free jazz, etc.), along with the natural
    creativity and intelligence of the group members (most had finished their college
    degrees before <i>Leg End</i> was released in 1973), spawned a sound unlike any
    contemporary prog band.  They were one of Virgin Records' first acts, and made
    their first tour with relative ""superstars"" Faust (and would later tour with
    Captain Beefheart)-- all of this during the heyday of ""symphonic"" prog bands like
    Yes and Genesis.</p><p>
    
    Henry Cow's sound always seemed to me a direct response to what was popularly
    passing as experimental music during their time.  Where a band like Gentle Giant
    (one of the more compositionally complex prog bands) would take classical
    counterpoint and color it with rock groove and volume, the Cow would remove color
    altogether, opting for sheer intensity through concept (often manifested in
    Marxist political statements) and relentlessly dry arrangements.  It wasn't
    enough that their tunes sounded like boisterous Schoenberg etudes, but they
    usually featured chamber classical instruments such as oboe, bassoon, clarinet
    and violin.  And, where a typical prog band would have used this to evoke the
    Romanticism of composers like Brahms or Strauss, Cow laid all their cards on the
    table by naming themselves after the experimental American composer Henry Cowell.
    They seemed very intent on opposing (Cutler would later even initiate the musical
    collective Rock In Opposition) any stereotype one might throw at them.</p><p>
    
    I must admit this has always colored my perception of the band.  If Yes were the
    double coconut-fudge of rock, perhaps best for escapist fantasies, then Henry Cow
    were certainly wheat germ.  It's not that they weren't cool in their way, but
    there's a not-so-subtle academic aftertaste to much of their music for me.
    <i>Western Culture</i> was their final record, and is probably the most overtly
    influenced by modern classical composition.  It's not very hard to hear why this
    music is important, in the sense that it lays the groundwork for a whole school
    of avant-rock and prog that doesn't cause cavities.  My caveat would be one of
    aesthetics, because if you're looking for a party, you'd best dig out ""Long
    Distance Runaround"" instead.</p><p>
    
    By the time <i>Western Culture</i> was released in 1979, the group was mostly
    separated.  Cutler and Frith would soon form the excellent Art Bears with Dagmar
    Krause (who had performed with Cow during several occasions), and Hodgkinson and
    reedist Lindsay Cooper wrote the pieces on this album exclusively.  ""Industry""
    begins things with a brain-freeze, as the opening organ screech gives way to
    dissonant guitar and hacking drums.  Hyper-rhythmic figures (but certainly not
    ""beats""), accentuated by stinging guitar and angular violin lines, suggest quite
    well whatever inhuman, technological madness the title implies.  There are no
    vocals anywhere on the album, so the difficult melodies rely on the arrangers'
    skill with voicing in order to stand out.  Now, if all of this sounds a bit
    technical, rest assured, that's probably appropriate.</p><p>
    
    ""The Decay of Cities"" brings in familiar sonorities with Frith's rather gorgeous
    acoustic guitar exposition.  All of the players were unsung in the grand scheme
    of prog, though Frith was arguably the most important element for this group if
    only because he brought a much needed touch of the ""real world"" to the music.
    After the intro, an ominous trombone and piano duet ensues, and Frith reenters
    with guitar figures at once Asian and Cageian.  There are some very clever things
    happening here, with kinetic trading of figures by percussion, guitar, piano and
    winds.  Later on, saxophone carries the tune, sounding like a cross between an
    intense, somber jazz balladeer and flighty, post-Ornette bopper.</p><p>
    
    Cooper's first piece, ""Falling Away,"" opens with a chorus of woodwinds, similar
    to some of Zappa's classical/jazz fusion experiments of the early 70s.  This
    reference is short lived, as the band bangs through with drums and a mad ostinato
    line that reminds me of their Belgian brethren Univers Zero (another classically
    minded band, who were somehow even more deadly serious than the Cow).  This leads
    to some of the most intense stuff on the record, as themes fly by at breakneck
    pace, while Cutler never stops pounding his kit (and still never actually playing
    beats).  ""Coretels Tale"" is more of the same, with enhanced moodiness via creepy
    flutes, and some nicely Cecil Taylor-esque piano playing.</p><p>
    
    The original <i>Western Culture</i> closes with ""1/2 the Sky"" (though the reissue
    includes three more tunes, including a tribute to one of Cutler's favorites, Pere
    Ubu).  Still no rest for weary ears, though I must say that I've always been
    impressed at Henry Cow's purity of vision.  Whatever you want to say of prog,
    even on the experimental end, bands that remain true to their original spirit are
    rare enough that I respect these musicians based merely on principal.  Of course,
    all of the individuals involved here would go on to very interesting careers in
    any number of odd settings, and I would be remiss if I didn't point out that even
    twenty years later they are more interesting than the majority of current
    experimental rock groups.  So they're not as ""entertaining"" (or as easy to poke fun
    at) as Yes, or as cool to name drop as Can or Faust, but Henry Cow were as original
    an act as ever played ""rock,"" and will probably continue to challenge listeners
    for as long as their work remains available.</p></div>"|3817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3817-western-culture/|8.0|Dominique Leone

It's a
    community of musicians popularly known to be directed by a two-headed beast, the
    madman and the sober prophet, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry and Osbourne ""King Tubby"" Ruddock.
    ""Digital music"" is shunned as artificial by fetishists.  ""These Fetishists are
    nothing more than pallid traditionalists"" is the secret message delivered by these
    15 tracks, a message encoded in bass.</p><p>
    
    This compilation comes at a terribly appropriate time.  The collective consciousness
    of the electronic music scene has advanced to a point where they can finally
    recognize the contribution of reggae music to their own production techniques.
    These producers are looking for something else: a ""Now Thing.""</p><p>
    
    The artists represented on this collection come forth as serious innovators of
    the dub music style.  They've managed to incorporate the heaviest aspects of dance
    music into crashing anthems and psyched-out battle cries.  It seems almost
    impossible, listening to these tracks, that this kind of music could be released
    in this day and age without anyone knowing about it.  The joy of hearing something
    new is accompanied by a sense that you're getting a gift.</p><p>
    
    ""Z2010"" by Lenky
    impresses such a sense of urgency on the listener.  With its distorted melodies and
    a vocoded voice chanting ""madness... madness... madness..."" throughout the length
    of the song, it's easy to imagine the type of scene that could accompany this
    music, which sounds like Timbaland creating propaganda music for the Government.
    Similarly, ""Grass Cyaat"" by Richard Browne has a repetitive chant of ""fever,""
    which has an even closer apparent relationship to hip-hop music, thumping with
    sped-up synthlines and slowed-down bass.  ""Jigga"" by Slam Productions samples
    Jay-Z's rendition of Scarface: ""OK!""  These affirmations are beautiful reminders
    of the grinding desire by these producers to move people physically.
    
    The organ and synthesizer sounds pervasive on these songs demonstrate the amazing
    ability of present technology to effectively reference tone and melody in an
    interesting manner.  These artists, like Steely &amp; Cleevie, fucking kill it on
    ""Nightcrawler,"" a death walk track with a shouted ""hey"" and unintelligible echoing
    garbles, bass-heavy and menacing.  The synth sounds evoke high danger.</p><p>
    
    The connections to the original Holy Dub Music which brought this all about is
    apparent throughout the song selections: the rhythms are constant reminders of
    the genre's roots.  <i>Now Thing</i> is Perry and Tubby through a digital guise,
    a literal transformation of time.  The beauty of the music lies in the intersections
    between its stark originality in beat construction and precise melodic and bass
    constructions, and its ability to properly reference its nascence in Jamaican ska
    and reggae.  Perhaps it's the inability of most contemporary producers to properly
    achieve the latter.  In any event, this document will prove influential to all
    those who hear it.</p><p>
    
    May the gospel of the <i>Now Thing</i> be spread amongst all willing participants.
    The tools are all present and reliable: vocoders, reverb, echo, bass, drums and
    uncompromising rhythm.  Do not let these cries go unheard.</p></div>"|1941.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1941-now-thing/|8.9|Michael Bernstein

    Remember the first time we met?  On that cloudy afternoon in the high school
    parking lot?  You brushed up against me as you unlocked the door of your car,
    and I noticed your shy smile and your Pedro the Lion t-shirt. I said hi.</p><p>
    
    And you said, ""There's a sharp December hush/ In the clearing where she kneels/
    Frost upon the ground/ Shoes worn in the heel/ This could be paradise.""</p><p>
    
    I shivered and said, ""Oh, wow. Is that Braid?""</p><p>
    
    You sighed. ""No, that's the Atari Star.""</p><p>
    
    I'll never forget the way our hands touched when you gave me the CD. It had this
    really pretty leaf drawing on the cover, and it was titled, <i>And Other Smaller,
    Brighter Worlds</i>, which is so beautiful and internal and intense. Your eyes
    lit up like soft September musing and you said, ""It's your new favorite band.""</p><p>
    
    Later that night, when we met on Instant Messenger. I plied you for more
    information. You told me that the Atari Star was on a record label called Johann's
    Face that put out a lot of bands you used to listen to back when you were ""sort of
    a punk rocker."" And there's a close label association with the Alkaline Trio, which
    is one of my favorite bands. And you said Marc Ruvolo, lead singer/guitarist for
    the Atari Star, is a co-owner of Johann's Face Records.</p><p>
    
    And I was so excited to hear the CD, because most bands that have ""Atari"" in the
    name are good. Except that one that's sort of goth. You told me to listen to track
    four, ""Occasional Genius and Everyday Polite Terror."" I did. And I heard these
    beautiful arpeggios of a keyboard on glockenspiel setting, and these repetitive,
    but totally sincere guitar lines. And I thought for a minute it sounded like
    elevator music, but that was cool because it also sounded a little bit like that
    band, Spandau Ballet.  But not quite so good.  Then this sweet, sort of off-key
    voice comes in singing, ""I cross my fingers/ Your look of sadness melts away.""
    And I teared a little, Josh. For real. Especially when he sang, ""You will become
    the things you say/ But stay with me tonight.""</p><p>
    
    The whole CD was that good. Even on ""Capricorn"" when the keyboard in the opening
    line sounds a lot like ""Jaws,"" but slower. I guess that's unintentional. Because
    these guys totally know how to rock the keyboard. So much so that I went up to the
    attic and pulled out my old Casio, and you know what? I could play most of the
    songs after a couple hours.</p><p>
    
    Not all the songs were slow and sad, either. Some of them, like ""Black Licorice
    and Gas Fumes,"" were up-tempo and dancy like my favorite songs on old Promise Ring
    records. There's this piano part that mom says sounds kind of like Neil Diamond,
    or maybe Billy Joel. And ""[hands]"" was just an instrumental with vacant white noise
    and disconnected voices, which sounds like a sonic interpretation of my totally
    hardcore ennui.</p><p>
    
    On our first date, we went to the vegetarian restaurant next door to Barnes and
    Noble, and after dinner we hooked up in your car to the sound of ""Ordinary Clock.""
    You wept when the keyboards crescendoed in those pretty, childlike chords at the
    line, ""She whispered to me un-self-consciously/ She whispered to me with gravity/
    That this, too, shall pass."" And then you tried to take off my bra.</p><p>
    
    It was like that for two weeks. Then my sister came home from college. I dragged
    her up to my room. ""This is my favorite band,"" I said.</p><p>
    
    I proudly played all our favorite songs, but halfway through the third, she stood
    abruptly, holding her ears, and said: ""Lindsay, this sounds like my ninth grade,
    over-enunciating, tone deaf actor ex-boyfriend, singing his own poetry, and
    playing a Casio keyboard at a Karaoke bar on 80s night. The only song that sort of
    works for me is ""Hands Accidentally Touch,"" which is fairly benign, quiet, and
    pretty. Even if the lyrics are silly and the keyboards are <i>cheesy</i>. Your
    boyfriend turned you onto this?""</p><p>
    
    I was so embarrassed, Josh, because the more I thought about it, she was right.
    The CD was pretty bad. But not even bad in a funny way. Bad in a depressing,
    pathetic, spineless sort of way. And that's not sexy. It's not even very appealing
    if you think about it. Kinda like how you'd get all sensitive and emotional right
    before you tried to take off my underwear. That wasn't a coincidence, was it?</p><p>
    
    So, I'm dumping you for a Strokes fan I met on Makeoutclub.com. His name is Jeremy.
    He smokes, and he doesn't like Atari Star. That's all you really need to know.</p><p>
    
    And so, what better way to end than with a line from our song, ""Hands Accidentally
    Touch""?  The same line you wrote in the fog on my window when we were making out
    in the car last week: ""I fix this image and then file it away/ Hands that touch/
    Linger briefly/ Then withdraw/ Landslides of silence touch the ether.""</p><p>
    
    What the fuck does that mean, anyway?</p></div>"|331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/331-and-other-smaller-brighter-worlds/|2.6|Alison Fields

    philosopher/apologist Francis Schaeffer wrote that every generation of Christian
    has the ""problem of learning how to speak meaningfully to its own age."" Soul Junk
    is Glen Galaxy's means of solving this problem.</p><p>
    
    Galaxy (aka Glen Galloway) formed Soul Junk in 1994 when his band, Trumans Water,
    relocated to Portland.  He stayed behind in San Diego (although he does still
    sit in with the band on occasion).  Anyone familiar with the freewheeling
    experimentalism of Trumans Water will hear it echoed in the music of Soul Junk,
    as there's a similar sense that anything might happen at any moment. There is one
    notable distinction, however: a good percentage of Soul Junk's lyrics (especially
    on the earlier releases) are drawn from the Bible. Verbatim.</p><p>
    
    That probably bothers a lot of people, and frankly, it bothers me a little bit, too.
    But I've come to realize that maybe to be bothered is exactly the point, or at
    least one of the points.  Maybe it's supposed to shock us, hearing those words
    and stories in these various musical contexts, into re-evaluating them.</p><p>
    
    Imagine a coarser-voiced, born-again Steve Malkmus and you've got a bead on Mr.
    Galaxy's style: a musical polymath, conversant in all genres without sounding
    contrived, or, at times, sounding so knowingly contrived as to be a self-reflexive
    comment upon itself.  At times, Galaxy seems so drenched in irony that he comes
    full circle to being sincere again.</p><p>
    
    As for this 6-song, 23-minute EP, it's straight-up solid. The Beck-meets-Madlib
    brand of hip-hop that permeated the last Soul Junk full-length is here replaced
    with a frantic, spazzed-out kind of indie rock and shambling folk-pop. Synths,
    banjo, trumpet, and anything else found around the studio gets thrown in, creating
    the feeling of some sort of strange, postmodern hootenanny.</p><p>
    
    It probably goes a long way toward explaining what this record sounds like to say
    that a few members of the Danielson Famile lend their skills, including Daniel
    Smith, who also recorded and produced the EP. The loose, free-flowing vibe is best
    captured on the bright, EP-ending mini-epic ""Good as Dead,"" on which Galaxy
    strains his vocal chords to the limit, howling, ""'I will speak to you,' and as he
    spoke his spirit came into me,"" as organ swirls in the background.</p><p>
    
    But if you just want to know whether or not an adventurous-listening non-Christian
    could get into this, I'd say-- like with the Danielson Famile-- the odds are
    probably better than those of your average Jesus freak.</p></div>"|7366.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7366-1942-ep/|7.5|Jason Nickey

I don't mean
    Shakespearean Middle English or even the formal English used in legal documents
    and treaties; I'm talking about simple syntax and spelling, and at the very
    least, some sort of shadow of grammar.  Of course, I'm not perfect myself-- I use
    sentence fragments all the time in my own reviews-- but I usually try, anyway.</p><p>
    
    I guess it's just a byproduct of our age and imperfect educational system that a
    lot of people simply don't write very well.  People either haven't learned how to
    write correctly, or just don't take the time to check themselves.  I get dozens
    of emails each week that don't even begin to resemble popularly accepted
    grammatical structures-- hell, just look at the angriest responses in our reader
    mail section for a veritable museum of mangled usage.</p><p>
    
    All of this fogeyish complaining stems from reading the title of this album, the
    debut from the Capitol Years.  Confession: it doesn't make a damn bit of
    difference whether or not this guy spells the title of his album <i>Meet Your
    Acres</i> or <i>Meet Yr Acres</i>, but I'll be honest and say that it just bugs
    the crap out of me.  I lay the blame for all this sans-vowel spelling of ""your""
    on Sonic Youth, who probably weren't the first to use it, but definitely helped
    popularized it in the underground during the 80s.  Lest I waste any more of your
    time with my obsessive rambling, though, let's have a look at the record.</p><p>
    
    First, let's mention that the Capitol Years isn't a band. Rather, it's a
    Philadelphia man who calls himself Shai, Son of Eli.  You can make your own
    judgment about that.  He variously gives himself credit for each of the instruments
    heard on the record, placing his name several times over a series of photos of
    adorable horses-- it's actually pretty endearing.  Shai also shares recording and
    mixing credits with Thom Monahan of Pernice Brothers fame, which gives him something
    close to autocratic control over the making of the entire record.</p><p>
    
    Of course, it takes a remarkable brand of artist to make a truly great recording
    with little to no outside aid, and let's just say that Shai isn't quite there yet.
    Based on the evidence presented here, he may get there someday soon, but all this
    album shows is a promising talent still in its infancy.  Shai and Monahan have
    managed to make the album sound excellent, and the songs flow together pretty
    well on the whole.</p><p>
    
    The meat of any rock record has to be in the songs, though, and while it all
    may sound great, most of the songs Shai has cooked up here aren't really that
    amazing, though not for lack of trying.  Songs like ""May"" and ""Sitar Fixer""
    develop unexpectedly away from their basic rock premises into more dissonant
    territory, while ""Faces and Beer"" is a highlight with its waltz beat and cleanly
    strummed guitars.  ""Faces and Beer"" contains one of the album's best melodies,
    and Shai delivers it ably, harmonizing with himself and keeping the feel laid
    back.  It's nice, but the problem is that it doesn't really go much of anywhere.
    It's verse after verse after verse, and it doesn't have a strong enough chorus
    to justify the lack of other sections.</p><p>
    
    ""Siamese Suns"" is somewhat similar in structure, but includes an acoustic guitar
    part that nicely answers the understated verse melody.  It's actually somewhat
    close to Elliott Smith's Kill Rock Stars output, with a quiet grace that suits
    Shai as a performer quite well.  ""Rolling Hills"" follows with a similarly pastoral
    vibe, though it's locked into a more standard rock groove.  The processed vocals
    in the chorus, which consists solely of the lyric ""come on, come down,"" resembles
    Mark Linkous playing it straight, while the massed Shais that echo the line in
    the background sort of sound like they wandered off from Mott the Hoople's ""All
    the Young Dudes"" sessions.</p><p>
    
    The album's folk-inflected midsection is definitely its best swath, and the other
    sections that surround it are plagued by a kind of facelessness that keep them
    from sticking.  ""Roller's Row"" opens things with off-kilter harmonies and a
    restrained rock feel that sort of resembles the Shazam with a lot less personality,
    while ""Here Comes..."" makes employ of that distorted Sparklehorse vocal sound to
    little effect.  It's the kind of thing that could be great if the writing were
    more consistently memorable.  The harmonica solo at the end adds a good texture,
    but nothing substantial musically.</p><p>
    
    Then there's the aforementioned ""Sitar Fixer,"" which begins over strummed acoustic
    guitar with a repetitive melody before a tuneless, heavily distorted guitar invades
    things and the drums come way up in the mix, playing a disjointed beat.  It's
    unexpected and even kind of interesting, but it doesn't seem to serve much of a
    purpose-- the song doesn't build to its ending naturally, and once the dissonant
    section does arrive, it's not developed beyond a short, repeated passage.</p><p>
    
    On the other end of the album, ""What's Yr Problem?"" is a fairly inconsequential
    instrumental featuring layered guitars over a programmed beat.  It functions well
    as a textural exercise, but as a piece of music it's aimless.  This brings us to
    the closer, a faithfully rendered cover of the Velvet Underground's ""All Tomorrow's
    Parties.""  It feels considerably folkier in his hands, given that he uses
    predominantly acoustic instrumentation, and even if he can't spell ""your,"" his
    pronunciation is certainly better than Nico's. All in all, though, the version is
    pleasant without adding anything to the original or making any attempt to
    reinterpret it.</p><p>
    
    So there you have it.  <i>Meet Yr Acres</i> shows a young artist with a ton of
    potential doing what young artists with a ton of potential often do-- making a
    spotty but competent debut album.  Obnoxious spellings aside, there aren't many
    glaring faults to be found with the Capitol Years' sound, just some areas that
    could use improvement.  Here's hoping the next record lives up to its potential,
    and maybe works on its spelling a bit.</p></div>"|1294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1294-meet-yr-acres/|6.2|Joe Tangari

    Chasers</i> made me believe again.  ""Optional Bases Opposed""?  ""The Top Chick's
    Silver Chord""?  That record's their best-kept secret, man!  It was the first album
    to really recapture the living room magic of <i>Bee Thousand</i>; rather than the
    band aesthetic they aimed for on <i>Alien Lanes</i> and <i>Under the Bushes</i>.</p><p>
    
    So last year, when I read that Pollard and Sprout were collaborating again on a
    <i>Tonics II</i>, I mean, that's got to totally kick ass, right?  I pre-ordered
    it from Fading Captain the first day!  Then it came like a couple of months later:
    Airport 5!  <i>Tower in the Fountain of Sparks!</i>  And... it wasn't their best
    work, but it sure sounded great.  There's no mistaking Sprout's bright, trebly
    guitars and cheapo drum machines beneath Pollard's Marlboro-enhanced growl.  And
    there were some nice hooks here and there-- ""Stifled Man Casino"" was pretty catchy,
    and ""Circle of Trim"" was prime GbV.</p><p>
    
    So I got the new one, <i>Life Starts Here</i>, and it's pretty much the same deal:
    Pollard's lyrics and vocals over instrumental beds provided by Sprout.  It's the
    formula Pollard's been mining since <i>Waved Out</i>-- recording the instruments
    at home in his spare time with friends, then knocking out the vocals and mixes
    in a couple of days in a real studio with a proper engineer.  Only now he doesn't
    write or play the music-- he just has friends like Sprout or Superchunk's Mac
    McCaughan send him instrumentals and sings over them, karaoke-style.  So there's
    no real opportunity for interaction, you know?  There's no re-taking the songs,
    no adding a bridge here or taking a few bars off the chorus there.</p><p>
    
    My biggest complaint about Guided by Voices has always been that there's a
    built-in disposability to the songs that leaves the listener always craving
    something more, something better.  ""That's so sweet how 'You're Not an Airplane'
    just ends the album like that, play it again...""; ""If 'Motor Away' had just been
    recorded better, I know it could have been a major radio hit...""; ""I can't believe
    they left 'Shrine to the Dynamic Years' off <i>Do the Collapse</i>,"" etc.  Their
    live shows are the same way: ""That's so cool that they just played 'Cut-Out Witch'
    and 'Echos Myron,' but when are they gonna play 'Peep-Hole'?""  And so it goes
    with Airport 5.</p><p>
    
    ""Yellow Wife No. 5"" and ""I Can't Freeze Anymore"" coast along on generic Sprout
    bass grooves, with nothing particularly offensive or exciting to stand out.
    ""We're in the Business"" steals shamelessly from Sprout's back catalog-- essentially
    a slowed-down, DOA retread of ""Beast of Souls"" with embarrassingly off-key delivery
    from the Fadin' Captain.  The attempts at variety in the instrumentation-- I'm
    thinking about the faux-horsetrot percussion on ""However Young They Are"" and the
    tinny synths on ""Out in the World""-- do nothing but ham-handedly disguise more
    of the same ol', same ol'. The interminable, pretentious epic ""Wrong Drama
    Addiction"" and unlistenable spoken-word fragment ""The Dawntrust Guarantee"" kick
    it up a notch in the canons of awful self-indulgence.  Surely Pollard, as a
    former schoolteacher, must once have told a kid, ""You are capable of better than
    this.""</p><p>
    
    Great music is about how it makes the listener feel, not about who appears in the
    credits.  Albums like <i>Life Starts Here</i> are about as exciting as a contractual
    obligation, and make a mockery of good, solid songwriting and recording.  It is,
    to be blunt, a waste of both the performer's and the listener's time.</p></div>"|83.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/83-life-starts-here/|2.8|Will Bryant

My father recognized this while
    yet a young man; it took me much longer to recognize the same with regards to him.
    For years I attempted to give Harlan imaginative, heartfelt Christmas and birthday
    presents, only to be dismayed when I would find said presents months later resting
    atop bookshelves, uncracked, or in the bottoms of a cardboard boxes, prepared for
    storage. All Harlan ever asked for was v-neck t-shirts, old-man boxers, and the
    occasional pair of khaki ""slacks."" It took me over 20 years to finally acquiesce
    in this boxers and slacks philanthropy.</p><p>
    
    To some degree, we all prefer the familiar. This explains the stateside failure
    of the metric system and, to a lesser extent, vegemite. Like they say, if it
    ain't broke, don't fix it. I feel the same way about women's hair. For example,
    what heterosexual male has not been forced to answer this question: ""Honey, how
    do you like my new haircut?"" For your information, the ""correct"" answer is always
    ""I love it. You look like Bo Derek."" The large-nutted boyfriend, however, would
    reject appeasement and instead offer the following rejoinder: ""You mean the one
    that makes you look like Billie Jean King? What the fuck were you thinking?""</p><p>
    
    If Damien Jurado's music were my girlfriend, I just might grow nuts and drop that
    bomb. The folk-pop of Jurado's prior three releases was honest, introspective,
    moody, sometimes peppy and sometimes heartbreaking. The new Jurado is none of
    those things. It is the long-haired girlfriend who gets mowed by Fantastic Sam's.
    Produced by Pedro the Lion's David Bazan, <i>I Break Chairs</i> consistently
    presents a more direct, aggressive rock tenor that is very surprising, and for a
    fan like myself, a bit disappointing.</p><p>
    
    Not disappointing at all, however, is the first track on <i>I Break Chairs</i>,
    ""Paperwings."" The rollicking pop-rock number has a gritty, foot-stomping edge to
    it, and a powerful chorus built around descending, overdriven bar chords (replete
    with Jurado yelping a high note way beyond his range). The tunes on the rest of
    the disc are recognizably Jurado, with sparse lyricism and Damien's characteristic
    melodic tools (like the guitar tracking the vocal melody, as on ""Inevitable"" and
    ""Air Show Disaster""). Orchestration is simple and direct, with guitars at the
    forefront and bass and drums locked and solid. Jurado's voice lends a folksy,
    country timbre to the mix. Another high moment comes on the instrumental denouement
    of ""Never Ending Tide,"" which balances a background of controlled feedback and
    drum machine with a wistful, reverbed guitar riff. ""Like Titanic"" blends pop-rock
    Damien with shades of the sweet, quaint, and thoughtful Damien of earlier years.
    It's sappy but rewarding.</p><p>
    
    By the end of the record, though, the songs begin to blend together (some even
    seem to blend into other albums, like ""Lose My Head,"" which I swear I've heard
    before). Jurado was aiming for thematic consistency with the disc; he wanted a
    rock record, and that's what he recorded. Stylistically, however, there's little
    room for error when writing pop-rock songs, especially those with a creative
    approach as generic as this collection. Without a recognizable hook, there's very
    little to set a song apart. So songs like ""Big Deal,"" ""The Way You Look,"" and
    ""Castles"" just seem to take up space. They're well executed, with plenty of sonic
    punch-- they just lack that certain je ne sai quoi that digs itself into your
    subconscious.</p><p>
    
    When you learn to love something, the word ""change"" is inherently bad. It inspires
    a reflexive hatred regardless of the merits of the change.  So maybe <i>I Break
    Chairs</i> was doomed from the start. But like short-haired women, I've warmed up
    a little to the new-look Jurado. It's not half bad-- it's solidly executed and
    very consistent. There aren't any obvious weak spots, and there are a few peaks.
    But in the final analysis, I yearn for the Damien of old. He just did what he did
    (the melancholy stuff, in particular) better than anybody else.  To use the 9/11
    vernacular, a return to normalcy would be welcome.  Let's just hope Damien's got
    a little Harlan in him.</p></div>"|4326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4326-i-break-chairs/|7.1|Brad Haywood

Every time a new season of ""The Sopranos"" comes on, I
    wait for some friend to tape it, and then I borrow the whole thing-- all thirteen
    hours-- and watch it in one, or maybe two sittings.  But later, if I go back and
    watch just one of the episodes, it's a different experience: every season is driven
    by a few main arcs, but watching it piece by piece, you can focus on the smaller
    stories and subtle structures that you miss when you plow through the whole thing.
    Each episode both gains and loses something when it's jammed in with the others.</p><p>
    
    Fred Frith's suite <i>Freedom in Fragments</i>, written for and performed here by
    the Rova Saxophone Quartet, explores the same idea: the relationship between the
    parts and the whole.  He says in the liner notes that he wanted to write compositions
    ""which could reach their narrative potential by a force of accumulation... small
    stories that, when heard together, become big stories.""  Each of the twenty-three
    sections of the suite has narrative qualities-- a feeling of drama, tension, or of
    action unfolding-- which reinforce each other when the sections are taken together.</p><p>
    
    Take the third piece, ""Song and Dance.""  The song bolts out with an anticipatory,
    pulsing rhythm under a soprano sax solo by Bruce Ackley.  It transitions to a
    whirling folk song as Steve Adams steps up on alto, before changing again to a
    driving but mournful finale behind Larry Och's tenor.  This is a strong and
    exciting piece by itself, but placed between the fanfare of ""Advertising"" and the
    probing introduction of ""Void Where Prohibited,"" it acquires a sense of drama:
    it's establishing a scene, or introducing a story.</p><p>
    
    At the other end of the record, the conflicts and tensions throughout the suite
    culminate in ""Chained to the Skyway,"" an ominous song that breaks into rapid,
    angry firing.  There's some kind of a fight going on that barely gets patched up
    on the next track, ""Batteries Not Included/Nostalgia,"" where Raskin's baritone
    stumbles in to make a guttural statement, and the others quietly join him.  The
    closer, ""Freedom Is Your Friends II,"" sounds bleak and wailing-- and if there's
    any complaint you can make about the piece as a narrative, it's that the conflict
    and woe prevail without much of a catharsis.  Tony Soprano may never escape his
    emotional struggle, but at least he gets to whack people.</p><p>
    
    Though <i>Freedom in Fragments</i> forms a loose story arc, this is just one
    configuration of the work.  Frith intended to keep it abstract and open: none of
    the compositions implies a specific story or theme, and further, they're written
    to be played in any order.  Some arrangements work better than others, but there's
    no definitive sequence.  <i>Freedom in Fragments</i> was commissioned in 1994 by
    Rova, leading interpreters of new music who perform works that rely heavily on
    improvisation.  Their experience with this piece (it's still in their repertoire
    today) shows in how well they interpret this flexible music.</p><p>
    
    The suite's greatest strength is the way it lets Rova crawl around their instruments,
    from the melodic ballads to noisy skronk.  The sax quartet is a powerful format,
    and for as little as it's been adopted, groups like Rova and the World Saxophone
    Quartet have demonstrated the awesome harmonies and pulsing rhythms that a small
    all-sax ensemble can produce.  ""Freedom in Fragments"" is a great workout, from
    ""Ikue's Song,"" a curious one-minute duet; the smooth and elegant ""Water Under the
    Bridge,"" which has the richest melody; or ""T Square Park Lark,"" a ten-minute piece
    that acts as its own epic, with Rova shifting seamlessly into group improvisation.
    Each member of Rova is a capable soloist but it's the ensemble sections that are
    really impressive: their growth over two decades together is undeniable.</p><p>
    
    Tzadik has done a typically great job of recognizing and recording an undervalued
    piece of music.  However, this time they made a critical mistake: probably to make
    a good listening experience, the album only includes sixteen of the twenty-three
    pieces in the suite.  A few sections have been recorded before, but this will
    probably be the only major release, and a different specialty label would have
    thrown in every single measure and every scrap of music.  If Tzadik had included
    the other sections as bonus tracks, or included another disc with an alternate
    sequence, this would be a definitive release; but as it stands, it's a great
    record of a fascinating work.</p></div>"|3210.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3210-freedom-in-fragments/|8.3|Chris Dahlen

The middle of the road.  It seems like I find myself here a lot when writing
    reviews.  Sometimes I'd rather get one of the pieces of trash from the gutter to
    review than yet another 5.0-7.0 disc.  See, the thing is, listening to these albums
    over and over again isn't really a chore or anything, but it's the thought that
    I'm probably not coming back to them any time soon that makes it feel kind of
    futile.  Plus, I just got an out-of-print Long Fin Killie album that I've been
    wanting to hear for ages in the mail, and this is keeping me from getting to it.</p><p>
    
    Ah, but the show must go on.  For without reviews of all albums great and terrible,
    and everything that falls in between, Pitchfork would not exist.  And we couldn't
    have that now, could we?  No, of course not.  On with it then.</p><p>
    
    Today's little slab of pavement comes courtesy of Josh Rouse, a young
    singer/songwriter with two albums and a collaborative EP with Lambchop's Kurt
    Wagner under his belt-- and, apparently, a lot more where that came from.  Let
    me be forthright: <i>Under Cold Blue Stars</i> is a rather appropriately titled
    effort that some will delight in and many more will scarcely offer a second thought
    to.  It's by no means a bad record, and there are even several things about it
    that make it outstanding, but there are just not enough of those things to make
    it a truly exceptional album.</p><p>
    
    The biggest problem with this album for me is Rouse himself-- not his writing or
    his composition, but his voice.  By and large, Rouse's vocals come off like a
    less tuneful, more crack-prone Ryan Adams, though, to be fair, it's the old,
    obviously sincere Ryan Adams he's being compared to here.  The problem arises
    from the fact that Rouse's songs are essentially pop tunes, and they'd be a lot
    more immediate if someone with a stronger voice were singing them.  His skillful
    lyrics are also frequently shrouded by his delivery, which is a damn shame
    because I get the feeling that these little vignettes could be quite affecting if
    properly read.</p><p>
    
    Still, Rouse manages at least a couple strong candidates for a single, with opener
    ""Nothing Gives Me Pleasure"" and ""Miracle.""  After a brief, orchestrated intro
    entitled ""Twilight,"" the drums kick in with a spirited rhythm and Rouse enters
    with only a spare keyboard line for support.  The vocals aren't great, but the
    double-tracking on the chorus of ""And don't you know/ Nothing gives me pleasure
    like you do/ Nothing has the strength to pull me through"" helps considerably.
    The song is aided by its little sonic nuances, like the little looped guitar
    sounds in the background and the quietly placed keyboard chords that help contour
    the verses.</p><p>
    
    ""Miracle"" follows with a breezy keyboard melody and a brisk beat that grabs the
    ear perhaps better than anything else on the album.  Sadly, Rouse's expertly
    penned vocal melody is actually upstaged by the keyboards, which simply have a
    more commanding tone.  Still, it's a fine song, with a good sense of dynamics in
    the bridge and an ultimately memorable melody.</p><p>
    
    From there, ""Christmas with Jesus"" enters with some horrid fuzz bass and a less
    than spectacular melody, and it becomes clear what a mixed bag the rest of the
    album is going to be.  The title track sounds great, with another good keyboard
    melody, a vague 70s soul feel and some nice vibes work from the Autumn Defense's
    Pat Sansone.  But once again, the vocal melody is compromised by a weak performance.
    ""Feeling No Pain"" rises prosodically skyward for its chorus: ""Lately I've been
    feeling no pain/ My heart is wide open, but everything falls into place.""  The
    rest of the song works well enough, but doesn't quite match up to the peak of the
    chorus.</p><p>
    
    ""Ears to the Ground"" redeems things to some extent, flowing smoothly on a steady
    groove augmented by hand percussion.  The subtle string flourishes and guitar
    parts in the background are what really make the song, though, as Rouse's voice
    is merely serviceable in the understated verses.  ""Summer Kitchen Ballad"" leaves
    him alone with an acoustic guitar and some very subtle strings, which is inadvisable
    at best.  As it is, the only reason a lot of this music works in the first place
    is that Rouse offers a strong rhythmic backing for his songs, and without it, his
    vocal limitations are all the more painfully noticeable.</p><p>
    
    ""The Whole Night Through"" is a pleasant closer-- Rouse can actually handle the
    fine melody this time, partly because he sings in a higher register than usual,
    which sounds a lot more natural.  But it's a pleasant cap to a pleasant album
    that never really rises much above pleasant.  The whole record sounds good, and
    producer Roger Moutenot (Yo La Tengo, Freedy Johnston) should get a certain amount
    of credit for creating a unified atmosphere for Rouse's songs to live in.  <i>Under
    Cold Blue Stars</i> ultimately ends up describing the sound of the album almost
    perfectly, and there's something to be said for that.</p><p>
    
    But at the end of the day, <i>Under Cold Blue Stars</i> has me feeling pretty
    indifferent.  The record company's claim that these songs are loosely based
    around the ""trials and tribulations of a small-town southern couple in the
    1950s"" only holds up if you're really looking hard for it, and even then, it
    seems like a strange claim to make, as the album stands up much better when
    viewed as a simple collection of ruminations on relationships.  This aside,
    <i>Under Cold Blue Stars</i> stands pretty firmly in the middle of that road I
    was talking about before, and it's up to you to decide if you want to bother.</p></div>"|6841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6841-under-cold-blue-stars/|6.4|Joe Tangari

Even if the artists involved are     brilliant, there's a tendency for them to sink to the lowest common denominator     during the recording process, resulting in albums that are either lifeless bores     or cartoonish fiascoes. Just look at the Mick Jagger/David Bowie abomination     ""Dancing in the Streets"" if you need proof of the latter. This, of course, is a     worst-case scenario, but it just goes to show that you've gotta be careful when     looking to collaborative albums for your musical fix.  In the rare cases where they     work, they offer something distinct. Combining to create a special chemistry, each     extracts something from the other that otherwise affect the music-- for example,     say, Waylon and Willie, or, uh, John Denver and the Muppets.</p><p><em>Stateless</em> is a three-way collaboration between the Seattle/Chicago-based     instrumental trio Unwed Sailor, Indiana's mostly instrumental quartet Early Day     Miners, and photographer Chris Bennett.  Over the course of a weekend last spring,     the two bands got together and dreamt up this score to Bennett's grainy and     haunting Super 8 footage, which was filmed on various trips across the United     States and Europe.  The resulting music is something like Mark Hollis leading     Tristeza, though it definitely leans more towards the Muppet end of the above     spectrum.</p><p>Unwed Sailor is still probably best-known because Pedro the Lion's David Bazan     once drummed for them, and the driving force behind the band, Jonathan Ford, used     to be a member of the storied band Roadside Monument. Likewise, Early Day Miners     are still working at shedding the specter of the fabled band from which they     sprang: the recently reformed but long-defunct Ativin.</p>
<p><em>Stateless</em> offers five songs, clocking in at a very digestible 30 minutes,     a major concern when dealing with music that moves at such a glacier-pace. But,     like a glacier, it can be incredibly powerful over time. The songs seem to have     been mapped out on the large scale, allowing plenty of room for improvisation     within the expanse. There is, however, one actual ""song,"" with vocals from EDM's     Dan Burton, that's perfectly placed dead center on the album, creating a nice     overall flow and bridging the longer ambient drones and mathy picking that bookend     the album.</p>
<p>Bennett's film is also included with the disc as a Quicktime file, and I highly     recommend watching it along with the music. Although this presents a problem for     people like me with horrible computer speakers; music this subtle loses a lot of     its character when piped through tiny Koss amplifiers.  Of course, you don't get     the complete statement without the accompanying images, and to be totally honest,     the music doesn't exactly provide a fully encompassing sonic experience on its     own.  If you've got the proper equipment to witness the A/V assault, <em>Stateless</em> at least offers a fine alternative to the dreck being sent through the digital     wires of expanded cable these days.  If not, there's always Denver &amp; Henson.</p>

They're better than
    At the Gates; they're better than the Haunted; lord knows they're better than
    Children of Bodom; and, you might not have the balls to say it, but fuck it, I do:
    they're better than Entombed (past and present).  How can I make such a bold
    statement?  Easy.  One word: originality.  Meshuggah doesn't sound like anyone
    else. Sure, there are influences, but, as Robert Urich's main man Emeril would
    say, they kick it up a notch.</p><p>
    
    Now, Soilwork-- they're no Meshuggah.  But they're close.  Damn close.  In fact,
    they even reinvent some of Meshuggah's greatest attributes just to drive that
    point home.  Sure, the guitar solos echo Fredrik Thordendal's, and even Bjorn
    Strid's vocals have taken on a Jens Kidman-like affectation, but with enough
    quick stops and starts to put you in a neckbrace and a sonic assault as raw as
    a head of lettuce, <i>Natural Born Chaos</i> stands as their tightest and most
    pummeling record yet.  The fact that it tops 2000's staggering <i>The Chainheart
    Machine</i> is only icing (but victorious icing, after last year's spotty <i>A
    Predator's Portrait</i>).</p><p>
    
    The one thing Soilwork has working in their favor that Meshuggah don't, though,
    is a goddamned sense of melody.  I know what you're thinking, but yes, there's
    plenty of room in metal for melody.  Ask Steve Fucking Harris if you don't believe
    me.  Soilwork switches back and forth between completely brutal thrash metal to
    melodic power metal without so much as battering an eyelash.  All of the key
    elements to a good metal record are here: it's crunches and grinds with growling
    verses and anthemic choruses, and of course, there are those glorious fucking
    guttural, demonic invocations that, in some other genres, are referred as ""vocals.""
    There are even keyboards, for Christ's sake!  I'm talking good atmospheric shit,
    too, not that overbearing, in-your-face classical crap Enchant forces on the
    Dream Theater pansies.  (Think ""Separate Ways,"" not ""The Final Countdown."")</p><p>
    
    In fact, the only real drawback to the record as a whole is that some of its songs
    just sound like the old Soilwork.  Imagine if you were halfway through a listen to
    the Flaming Lips' <i>The Soft Bulletin</i>, and right in the middle they threw in
    some stuff from <i>Hit to Death in the Future Head</i>.  Don't get me wrong,
    <i>Hit to Death</i> is a damn good album, but you know, you don't get that kind
    of contrast on records we in the business would call ""classics.""</p><p>
<i>Natural Born Chaos</i> peaks with the back-to-back shrapnel-spitting of ""As We
    Speak"" and ""The Flameout."" Both are incredibly dense and heavy, and somehow also
    maniacally catchy-- a combination that has evaded most of the strongest Swedish
    metal bands going.  Also, it should be noted that ""Mindfields"" has one of the
    coolest pauses I've heard in a while (who doesn't like a good pause?).  The only
    two songs that most readily come to mind as being misses are the title track (which
    could nearly make it onto MTV if it rode out its opening rhythm), and the closer,
    ""Song of the Damned,"" which anticlimactically loses some of the steam the rest of
    the album had built up.  But I only name those two songs because I feel like I have
    to name something.  They're not <i>actually</i> bad songs.  They're just not quite
    as mind-altering as some of the others.  And ""Song of the Damned"" is a kinda dorky
    name.  Whatever.</p></div>"|7317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7317-natural-born-chaos/|8.5|Cory Byrom

Over the years, our mailboxes have been
    perpetually packed with hundreds of virtually indistinguishable emo releases,
    leaving our synonyms for the word ""whiny"" all but exhausted. Therein lies the
    greater problem: the standard emo review has become just as formulaic and
    uninspired as the insipid genre which it criticizes. One can only invoke the
    American Music Club so many times before carpal tunnels claims and recasts his
    cramped hands as veritable claws, eternal tokens of his crusade against all that
    aches of unwieldy derivation. Luckily, we found someone to stand in for Brent, but
    it goes without saying that our once proud emo reviews are quickly losing their
    potency in light of the cancerous popularity our sworn enemy is enjoying.</p><p>
    My first instinct upon hearing Reuben's Accomplice was to a create a review
    comprised solely of cut-and-pasted excerpts from our archive as a sort of social
    commentary on ""unabashed genre-bashing as critical synapse."" Instead, I've come
    to the, admittedly, self-serving conclusion that ""if Reuben's Accomplice don't
    contribute anything discernibly different from their peers, I shouldn't feel
    obligated to break from those traditions indigenous to my people.""</p><p>
<i>I Blame the Scenery</i>, at its best, is an unpretentious exercise in puerility
    that yearns for the days of jilted playground love. Unfortunately, whatever
    traumatic experiences culminated in the group's desire to make this kind of music
    seem to have stunted their musical and lyrical growth, which are firmly mired in
    the politics of junior high. Opting to approximate the callow self-centeredness
    of pubescence is not a crime in and of itself. Rather, it's the poor handling of
    the simple subject matter that damns Reuben's Accomplice as just another M2 flavor
    of the week and makes <i>I Blame the Scenery</i> an often grating listen.</p><p>
    Opening shows for the similarly marketed Jimmy Eat World might have influenced the
    songwriting.  Throughout the course of the album, the Accomplice shed any
    distinguishing structural deviations and reveal themselves as exact carbon-copies
    of their more commercially inclined emo counterparts.  But what Jimmy Eat World
    haven't mastered is the art of cramming as many clichés as possible into the
    smallest given area, something Reuben's Accomplice accomplish with commanding
    authority on ""Fireworks.""  In short, the song's a meditative, mid-tempo nostalgic
    trip about a ""brown-sweatered"" girl who singer Jeff Bufano saw ""smile under the
    fireworks"" one evening.  She is urged by Bufano to come back and ""work it out.""</p><p>
    There's a fine line between disarming simplicity and plain lack of talent. Though
    Reuben's Accomplice sound like capable musicians, <i>I Blame the Scenery</i> falls
    into far too many stylistic traps to achieve the emotional impact it intends.
    Maybe in the future, Bufano and company will overcome their drama and record
    something that doesn't send people through a painful series of winces.  And who
    knows?  If they wish upon a falling star, all their dreams might just come
    true!  Anything is possible!</p></div>"|6769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6769-i-blame-the-scenery/|2.8|Kevin Adickes

    using it as much as musicians hate being labeled as such.  Over the past twenty
    years or so, what was once a sly reference to integrating the mundane into Real
    Art has become a catch-all for anything that quotes lines from Coke ads or
    after-school specials.  I don't believe it was ever supposed to be a joke (though
    irony must have figured in somehow), but now when I hear musicians strutting their
    pop culture stuff, it provokes slight annoyance and suspicion more than any kind of
    serious attempt to find meaning in their second-hand statements.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there are exceptions to this: Beck's often interesting (and sometimes
    contrived) AM Gold amalgams, John Zorn's manic Saturday morning freak-outs, and
    the downright odd cinematic society collages of David Lynch.  Some might argue
    that these artists are famous enough that their work has, by definition, surpassed
    the whole idea of ""post modernism"" and is merely ""modern.""  Others might claim
    that their fondness for iconic imagery and reference is actually a crutch to
    disguise their lack of originality (and I <i>have</i> heard that criticism, ridiculous
    as it is).  But really, my only qualm with someone like John Zorn is not that he
    depends too much on the mundane-- it's that he doesn't spend enough.  It's as if
    he has a disability to remain fixed on one aspect of his work long enough to
    maintain a clear relationship to anything, and rather bounces like a mosquito from
    bright spot to bright spot.  It makes for very interesting music, albeit often
    frustratingly flighty.</p><p>
    
    Saxophonist Ellery Eskelin may yet be the supreme prophet of the ""post-modern"" in
    music.  This is a man who has seemingly taken it upon himself (and conspirators
    Jim Black and Andrea Parkins) to find the missing link between jazz, rock,
    electronic music, pop and plain old everyday static.  Where fellow New Yorkers
    like Zorn or Tim Berne might take the high road by writing unplayable tunes with
    insane levels of intensity, Eskelin organizes improvisational sessions for his band
    to summarize the chapters of their backgrounds-- all of which are considerably
    varied.  Eskelin is also not afraid to play music that is superficially ""familiar"";
    i.e., many of his tunes sound like things you would hum on your own, like melodies
    everyone knows without ever having been expressly taught.</p><p>
    
    The trio that made this album (the seventh in a series, part of a development
    program for the Swiss hatOLOGY label) has been together since 1994.  Eskelin had
    previously issued several solo albums, in addition to gaining fairly widespread
    exposure with drummer Joey Baron's Barondown project.  Percussionist Jim Black
    came to New York from Seattle in the early 90s, getting his biggest props with
    Tim Berne's Bloodcount (he's since become arguably the most in-demand experimental
    percussionist in New York), and keyboardist/sampler player Andrea Parkins has made
    her name with Eskelin's group and for solo performances.  Together, they form one
    of the most interesting units in jazz, and if there is any justice, they'll find
    more funding to continue this series of recordings (their grant only ran through
    2001).</p><p>
    
    Similar to previous albums in the series, <i>12 (+1) Imaginary Views</i> calls on
    the collective experiences of the players to feed the music.  Eskelin's heavy jazz
    background (he studied with Dave Liebman and George Coleman, among others) and
    knack for penning subtly memorable melodies reminds me of similar strengths of
    another jazz populist: Thelonious Monk.  Like Monk, his music is often simple on
    the surface, but repeated listens reveal a marvelously advanced efficiency in the
    arrangements (as a bass-less trio, this is a plus) and compositions.  Fittingly,
    this group plays the old master's ""Oska T"" as a virtual encore at the end of the
    disc.</p><p>
    
    The anthemic ""Opener"" describes its purpose as the first track, and wastes no time
    in starting the show.  Black is all over the kit, and if you haven't had the
    sincere pleasure of hearing him play, by all means obtain this record.  The man is
    a genius, and certainly deserves more space than can be allotted in this review to
    espouse on his imaginative, virtuosic playing.  Eskelin's repetitive (and forcibly
    catchy) melody is supported by Parkins' accordion patch.  Furthermore, though I
    took this stuff without so much as a second thought, I would be hard-pressed to
    say what kind of music they were playing.  It wasn't really jazz (where's the
    ""swinging"" and solo section signpost?), certainly not rock (even though Black is
    terribly fond of dropping mad beats all over the place), maybe a bit influenced
    by Balkan rhythms and textures, but not really. Best of all, this lack of a label
    applies to every second of music on the album.</p><p>
    
    ""Four Chords"" features more hard beats by Black, and like the title says, Parkins
    giving you four chords on the piano.  There are a few dozen other things in there,
    too, such as what sounds like Eskelin running his horn through a sewer pipe while
    playing ""Flight of the Bumblebee.""  ""Low(ly)"" is the first tune to really take
    advantage of the wide array of electronic effects at Parkins' disposal.  It begins
    with a spooky backdrop that sounds like a chorus of flies, and leads to very
    aggressive piano/organ improvisation.  Soon, Eskelin enters over the by-then
    restrained organ, playing relatively straightforward solo lines, reminiscent of
    his old mentor Liebman (who was, in turn, following late-period Coltrane).  What
    first seemed like an exercise in Artistic Electronic Composition ends up an
    abstract funeral dirge.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, they kick out the jams: ""Plastiche"" makes life all the more worth
    living about three minutes in when it hits on the fucked up beats and super
    James Bond-style suspense melodies.  All praise be to Black!  They pull a
    similar trick on ""Grafik,"" but wait until four minutes into a hefty improv
    session to hit you.  ""Modular"" may be the best groove on the album, though I
    can only describe the opening as Kiss trying to play an Ornette Coleman
    tune.  They stretch out the middle with some rather hectic impressionism
    (sounds like a hurricane to me), and nail the tune to the wall at the end
    like be-bop Ruins.</p><p>
    
    I could go on about how the best stuff here was actually the softer, yet more
    detailed electronic pieces like ""Naked Eye"" or gorgeous minimalism of ""Combulatory,""
    but hopefully you'll just go out and pick up the disc to hear for yourself.
    Eskelin doesn't quite get the headlines of some of his New York compatriots,
    though it certainly isn't for lack of experience or creativity.  Maybe the jazz
    instrumentation throws off all but the hardcore improv-philes, or maybe people
    just don't have time for more than one or two downtown New York sax players.
    Whatever the case, I can safely say that anyone missing Eskelin and his band of
    real modernists is missing quite a lot.</p></div>"|2833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2833-12-1-imaginary-views/|8.9|Dominique Leone

    when Warp released the <i>Surfing on Sine Waves</i> album under his Polygon
    Window alias. Though a few imports had already made a ripple stateside, <i>Surfing
    on Sine Waves</i>, distributed by TVT, marked the first time a James record could
    be found at domestic prices. The album was originally one in a line of Warp's
    ""Artificial Intelligence"" releases, a series that later birthed the much-maligned
    genre designation ""Intelligent Dance Music."" As part of the label's recent
    retooling of its catalog for a larger U.S. audience, <i>Surfing on Sine Waves</i>
    has now been remastered and re-released in the States with the addition of two
    unreleased tracks from the period.</p><p>
    In the wake of 2001's <i>Drukqs</i>, an album most Aphex Twin enthusiasts consider
    among the man's worst (I'm still waiting for a used copy to show up), it's fun to
    get reacquainted with the old material, if only to get an idea of what made James
    such an electronic music icon. <i>Surfing on Sine Waves</i> is rarely rated with
    the <i>Selected Ambient Works</i> albums or the early singles collected on
    <i>Classics</i>, but it's still a key record from the era that put James on the
    map and began the myth-making that would mushroom to Howard Hughes proportions
    around the time of the ""Windowlicker"" single.</p><p>
    Listening to <i>Surfing on Sine Waves</i> in the context of electronic music circa
    2002, I get an idea what it must have been like to listen to Buddy Holly in 1970.
    Naturally, there are both positive and negative aspects to re-experiencing artifacts
    from an earlier time. While this album is a crude template for what post-rave
    electronic music would eventually become, there is a charm in its technological
    naïveté, and the record's devotion to puritan virtues like chords and tunes is
    appealing in a post-Autechre world packed with overachieving signal processors.
    Catchy, melodic and memorable tracks are what made the Aphex Twin so wonderful at
    his best; <i>Surfing on Sine Waves</i> has a handful of these, albeit in rough,
    embryonic form.</p><p>
    There are basically three kinds of tracks on this record: the hard dancefloor bang,
    the edgy mid-tempo bounce, and the melodic ambient drift. Bangers like ""Quoth"" and
    ""Quixote"" are the weakest of the lot to my ears, and they wind up being where the
    lack of technology is felt most. Though they surely sounded revolutionary on the
    '93 dance floor, the thin beats have since lost authority and lack the drum
    programming audacity that James would develop as the 90s wore on. Check
    ""Isopropophlex"" and ""AFX2"" from the <i>Analog Bubblebath</i> EP and ""AFX114"" from
    <i>Caustic Window Compilation</i> for far more commanding examples of this sound.</p><p>
    The propulsive mid-tempo numbers are what sound most interesting to me now. The
    sour acid squelch of the Roland TB-303 is the lead instrument on both ""Ut1-Dot""
    and the untitled seventh track, with the latter inflating the signature sound to
    almost comic proportions. Working against the harsh machinations of the 303 are
    soft layers of keyboards and tinny but gently insistent beats. Sometimes these
    three components seem to be navigating entirely different but complimentary paths,
    giving the music an endless, drifting quality.  Turns toward the kind of melody
    that made James famous include the jittery, piano-driven ""If It Really Is Me,""
    which sounds like Kraftwerk covering the theme from ""The Young and the Restless""
    (that's ""Nadia's Theme"" for those of you without access to Mary J. Blige liner
    notes).</p><p>
    The two unreleased tracks are solid and fit nicely with the original record.
    ""Portreath Harbour"" is electro with a Middle Eastern tinge, as robotic handclaps
    compete for space with a melody right out of <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>. ""Redruth
    School"" is filled with repeating patterns of percussion, with a faux-xylophone
    sequence providing counterpoint to the mournful synths. Wisely, Warp decided to
    keep the quiet and lovely ""Quino - Phec"" as the album closer on this version of
    <i>Surfing on Sine Waves</i>, as it ranks with the best of Aphex's ambient work
    in conjuring alien atmosphere. Though not quite an essential James release,
    <i>Surfing on Sine Waves</i> remains an excellent album from a fascinating and
    important period in electronic music.</p></div>"|6393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6393-surfing-on-sine-waves/|8.1|Mark Richard-San

    may be clouded with unfortunate associations.  And what a shame, because if Neil
    Halstead's career-- from Slowdive to Mojave 3-- were, say, the hint in a ""Super
    Password"" bonus round, ""dreamy"" would be the $500 answer hiding behind that
    plastic blue slipcard.  (Burt Convy confirmed this late last night when I ran
    into him at the supermarket.  Then he gave me my change and sighed wistfully.)</p><p>
    
    Apparently not content with being the dominant creative force in Mojave 3, Halstead
    has now launched a solo career.  And his first strictly-Neil outing, <i>Sleeping
    on Roads</i>, is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a pretty dreamy affair.  It's the sort
    of disc you'd want to have on hand for scenic twilight drives (provided you're not
    the one driving), what with its deft arrangements and mild vocals.  It's an easy
    listen.  I took a long, gratifying nap yesterday while this album played on repeat.
    And if that makes you cringe, you're probably better off spending your money on
    something a little more upbeat.  Like Ida.</p><p>
    
    To be fair, ""See You on Rooftops"" is, by extremely liberal standards, something of
    a rocker-- a muted, southern-fried electric guitar line seers over sudden bursts
    of jungle-like breakbeats while warped keyboard tones echo Boards of Canada's
    signature style.  Here, Halstead builds, with the assistance of friends (including
    fellow Mojave 3/Slowdive bandmate Ian McCutcheon), an expansive sound-- heavy on
    ambient drones, electronic strings, and celestial sound effects.</p><p>
    
    But ""See You on Rooftops"" and the record's opener, ""Seasons,"" are atypical on an
    album primarily comprised of the slow and sad (think Nick Drake with a synth),
    even if some of the more maudlin tracks do integrate off-beat instrumentation.
    The title song features both banjo and dobro, yet narrowly avoids sounding country.
    There's also a half-cover of Damien Jurado's ""Ohio"" (Halstead acknowledges borrowing
    the melody, though he's written a new set of lyrics for it), and a considerable
    amount of material that sounds just a hell of a lot like Belle and Sebastian,
    albeit without the lyrical smirk.</p><p>
<i>Sleeping on Roads</i> concludes with the spare, acoustic ""High Hopes,"" one of
    its most affecting, and depressing, moments.  Halstead does tack a happy ending
    of sorts onto the record, though.  After several moments of silence, the listener
    is treated to a quick taste of some of Neil's trademark dream-pop as the album
    fades out. The literal closing lullaby-- perfect for a short, sleepy, clever
    comment before moving onto greener pastures where sheep always jump placidly over
    flowered hedges.</p><p>
    
    But I'll be direct here: this is a far cry from Neil's artistic apex.  Of course,
    it's comforting to realize he clearly isn't saving his best work for his solo
    records and thus, holding out on Mojave 3.  Which isn't to say <i>Sleeping on
    Roads</i> is without its charms.  But taking into account the sometimes spotty
    songwriting and its overtly dreamy similarities to Mojave 3 (like if they'd had a
    back massage and 1200mg's of Valium), there isn't much to save it from solo slump
    status.  I mean, sure, it sounds nice and all, but the guy has records out there
    like <i>Souvlaki</i> and <i>Ask Me Tomorrow</i>.  Trust me when I say you'd rather
    be listening to those instead.</p></div>"|3721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3721-sleeping-on-roads/|6.5|Alison Fields

Well, there are two paths
    you can take from here. You can analyze that which made you successful, break it
    down to its barest parts, and see what makes it tick. But be careful; often, all
    this overanalysis yields is the painful knowledge that what made your music work
    was the spontaneity and unbridled creativity that all your careful nitpicking and
    study would render obsolete.  Your other option is the road with the rusty old
    sign plunked in the ground labeled ""HARD WORK.""  That's right: just because you've
    made it doesn't mean you can take it easy.  If anything, you'll have to work even
    harder, because everything you'll do from this point on will be held up against
    that last amazing thing you did.  Yup, it turns out you're your own worst
    competition.  And worse yet, working hard doesn't even guarantee continued triumph.</p><p>
    
    Take Rob Mazurek and Chad Taylor, for instance.  In the mid-90s, these two started
    a weekly improv gathering at Chicago's infamous Green Mill jazz club, which led to
    various recorded incarnations as the Chicago Underground Duo, Trio, Quartet, and
    Orchestra.  It's hard to pin down the moment when the Chicago Underground first
    achieved success.  All of its members are all consummate performers, liable to
    amaze audiences whether they're playing in a hole-in-the-wall jazz venue, a college
    auditorium, or an oversized rock club.  Every album released under the Chicago
    Underground banner has been undeniably solid as well.  So, in a sense, they've been
    successful all along.  But in my mind, the turning point came with 1999's
    <i>Synesthesia</i>.  At times free jazz, and at others as carefully structured as
    a good book, <i>Synesthesia</i> was a revelation on first listen and it remains
    absolutely stunning to this day.</p><p>
    
    Last year's <i>Chicago Underground Quartet</i> album saw Mazurek and Taylor
    supplementing their usual fervent free-jazz explorations with the dignified calm
    of 1950s bebop-style jazz.  Now, the continually evolving duo heads for untraveled
    territory once more.  Mazurek still plays cornet on <i>Axis and Alignment</i>, and
    Taylor still plays drums and vibraphones, but here they take new chances with
    different instruments and sounds, with mixed results.</p><p>
    
    ""Average Assumptions and Misunderstandings"" finds cornetist Mazurek plunking away
    at a piano.  First, he interjects quick and staccato, stabbing at the peaceful
    backdrop created by Taylor's vibraphones.  But as he picks deeper notes and the
    piano begins to resonate, Taylor switches places with him, striking faster and
    faster at the piano's all-encompassing rumble.  ""Memoirs of a Space Traveler""
    opens by following the now-familiar Chicago Underground formula for free
    improvisation-- driving cornet skronks, rapid-fire drums, and a static electronic
    drones all fight for attention-- only everything collapses halfway through.
    Mazurek lingers on a note, Taylor strums an acoustic guitar, and a laptop fixates
    on the synthesized sound of glass breaking.  Predictably, neither musician is
    anywhere near as talented with these new toys as they are with their usual
    instruments, but the new sounds are a refreshing change of pace after three
    albums of little more than cornet, vibes and drums.</p><p>
    
    Most notable on <i>Axis and Alignment</i> are the electronics.  While the Duo's
    previous two albums made use of found/manipulated sound and occasional Powerbook
    flourishes, this release sees them stepping into the forefront.  Their role is
    still mostly minimal, but one can sense a certain confidence. No doubt, Mazurek's
    work on Orton Socket, his superb solo laptop project released last year on Jim
    O'Rourke's Moikai label, has made him more comfortable in front of a monitor.</p><p>
    
    In many cases, like the short, introspective number ""Lem,"" the electronic elements
    are so minimal and atmospheric that they may easily go unnoticed.  But later, on
    ""Noon,"" Mazurek plays with this subtlety, allowing the minimal rumbling in the
    background to all but conquer the other elements of the song by the time the song
    ends.  The electronics take on a much more structured form on ""Exponent Red"" and
    ""Two Concepts for the Storage of Light,"" both built around synthesized basslines
    that seem lifted directly off Isotope 217's <i>Who Stole the I-Walkman?</i>.</p><p>
    
    ""Exponent"" serves as a necessary reprieve from some of the less structured numbers.
    ""Two Concepts,"" however, is a long track that starts off structured, gets crazy,
    then calms again over the course of eight or nine minutes.  Though a fine piece
    of music on its own, it seems little more than a failed attempt to replicate the
    greatness of ""Blue Sparks Form Her, and the Scent of Lightning,"" the stunning
    opening track from <i>Synesthesia</i>.  Where that song took listeners on a
    literary-style journey, complete with foreshadowing and false climaxes, ""Two
    Concepts"" seems a bit more content just to stay in one place.</p><p>
    
    For all its great moments, extra flourishes and new explorations, <i>Axis and
    Alignment</i> never quite matches the gripping nature or the emotional resonance
    of its predecessor.  But Mazurek and Taylor should be commended for branching out,
    for insisting on trying something new when churning out a replica of past successes
    might well have seemed easier.  It's a tough decision for any artist to make. But
    then, no one ever said success would be easy.</p></div>"|1438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1438-axis-and-alignment/|7.5|David M. Pecoraro

    It's true.  A close look at the pop charts from the last couple of years reveals
    that today's biggest hitmakers aren't Britney or J-Lo or Madonna, but EQ wizards
    Timbaland and the Neptunes.  Not since the heydays of Motown and Phil Spector have
    the men behind the board carried such bankability in the industry.  Now, more and
    more, we're seeing these über-producers cutting out the middlemen, releasing albums
    under their own name or a slight variation thereof (N.E.R.D.).</p><p>
    It's no surprise, then, that Dan Nakamura, aka Dan the Automator, aka Nathaniel
    Merriweather, aka ""dude, that Asian guy from the Gorillaz,"" wants to get in on
    the action.  For the past half-dozen years, the Automator has been the
    Timbaland/Neptunes correlate for the underground, a knob-twiddling ambassador
    between the worlds of alternative hip-hop and indie rock. Collaborating with
    everyone from Kool Keith to Jon Spencer, Nakamura pulls off the seemingly
    impossible task of retaining his street cred while appealing to the less
    rap-inclined (pronounced ""white"") crowd whose rap collection doesn't run beyond
    <i>Ill Communication</i>.</p><p>
    I don't hold myself above the latter group: the Deltron 3030 project was one of
    the few hip-hop albums to penetrate my guitar-loyal musical sensibilities, though
    that was at least half because I'm a sci-fi geek who enjoys hearing Neuromancer
    and Gamera name-dropped.  I'll even admit to enjoying the Gorillaz album, the
    singles from which have provided the first digestible MTV fare in years.  And
    frankly, anyone who collaborates with Mike Patton earns a spot on my good list.
    No matter what the project, the Automator consistently has brought a sound just
    organic enough, just diversely influenced enough, just ""safe"" enough to catch my
    ear.</p><p>
    So the idea of an Automator-chosen mixtape session, billed as ""a look into my
    head"" by the man himself, appealed to me.  Featuring the likes of Tortoise and
    Air rubbing up against Brand Nubian and Dilated Peoples, I expected a gonzo
    display of effortless genre-hopping and style-blending, despite Nakamura not
    being well-known for his DJ scratching skills.</p><p>
    All right, yeah, you know from the rating where this is heading: <i>Wanna Buy a
    Monkey?</i> didn't live up.  Containing a number of selections from the Automator's
    own projects alongside some of his hand-picked favorites from other artists,
    <i>Monkey</i> comes off resembling either a padded greatest-hits comp or an
    ""inspired by"" soundtrack for a non-existent movie.  What it certainly isn't is
    a DJ mix where previously hidden links between seemingly unrelated songs are
    unearthed through the ancient art of juxtaposition.</p><p>
    Part of the problem lies in the musically segregated organization of the album,
    as the Automator's hip-hop selections are clumped into the front and back, while
    the indie-friendly picks comprise the creamy center. This allows Nakamura to
    splice tracks together with minimal segue ingenuity, mostly using the Radio 101
    technique of slowly fading in the beat from the on-deck song.  Meanwhile, the one
    opportunity to flaunt high-flying mixing ability, Deltron 3030's ""Positive Contact""
    into Air's ""Le Soleil Est Pres de Moi,"" is handled with all the dexterity of a
    one-armed drummer (Rick Allen notwithstanding).</p><p>
    Sadly, these short between-song mixtures, as inventive as they ain't, are the most
    compelling manipulations of the album.  The Automator's additions to the members
    of his all-star team fall under the categories of near-invisible (the vocal sample
    added to a portion of Tortoise's ""Seneca"") or distracting (the generic beat and
    ""one, two"" vocals clumsily added to Air's ethereal ""Le Soleil"").  Even Nakamura's
    own productions (Lovage, X-Ecutioners, an early Black Rob track) are left alone,
    with only the ""original version"" of Gorillaz' ""Latin Simone"" deviating significantly
    from the album version.</p><p>
    To Dan's credit, <i>Wanna Buy a Monkey?</i> confirms what was already apparent
    from his own work-- namely, that he has classy and diverse musical taste. There's
    hardly a disagreeable pick among the sixteen present, and most reflect the same
    sensibilities Nakamura adds to his own music: live instruments, Latin flavoring,
    positive lyrical messages.  But something tells me I would be more sold on the
    liner notes' claim that he has ""something very personal to say on this record"" if
    the artists presented were early influences rather than contemporaries.</p><p>
    It's hard to imagine who would want to pick up this disc, as most Automator fans
    would likely own a majority of the cuts appearing with minuscule changes here.
    Perhaps <i>Wanna Buy a Monkey?</i> could be justified as a listening guide to
    point fans towards artists with the Automator stamp of approval, but this goal
    could have been just as easily accomplished by reading an online interview and
    booting up your Audiogalaxy satellite.  And with almost nothing in the way of
    imaginative mixing, never mind a $16.99 price tag; <i>Wanna Buy a Monkey?</i>
    seems nothing more than an early contender for <i>The Onion</i>'s ""Least Essential
    Albums of 2002"" list.</p></div>"|374.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/374-wanna-buy-a-monkey/|4.0|Rob Mitchum

 I feel so weird doing this! I usually have no problems meeting people in bars, but
    my friend dared me to try Pitchfork Personals, so here I am.  But please, ladies,
    if you don't have a picture, don't bother replying.
</p>
<p>
 Beats are the number one priority in my life. If you like creative beats, you'll
    like me. Besides for beats, I also like Red Lobster, Lucy Liu and unprotected sex.
    Rhymes and lyrics are important, but I don't mind sharing-- I do it all the time
    with my friends Huggy and Al-Shid.  But regardless of who's on the mic, the rhymes
    are raw (sex, underage sex, unprotected sex, and other variations on the theme),
    tight as shit, and damn funny (""You make as much noise as En Vogue without Dawn"").
    I don't care about being a hip-hop purist. I don't care what hip-hop is ""all
    about.""  I am about starting a fucking party.  Maybe even a ""fucking party,"" if
    you give up some of that ass.
</p>

<p>
 Like I was saying before, beats mean so much to me. I need someone who can handle
    beats being number one in my life. They truly are my passion.  The ladies tell me
    I have kind of an Automator thing going.  Fuck that.  I don't do that grandiosity
    and sophistication bullshit-- I'm about the ghetto and, if you're nice, I can be
    real playful. See, name-dropping don't cut it with me. I'm unique.  Check the
    blundering samples on ""Q&amp;A;"" and ""Live from Pimp Palace East""-- the carnival
    quality of something lifted from an episode of ""The Three Stooges"" or ""Keystone
    Cops.""  Girl, who does this?  All I'm saying, the shit is dope.
</p>
<p>
 And I got more where that came from.  Check ""The Bum Bitch Ballad."" I'm all
    sampling strings and accordions, almost to where it brings up visions of a
    pastoral French landscape.  But I don't wanna get too romantic about it, so I
    play it cool.  We wanna have ourselves a good time, not a picnic lunch.  So
    instead of a blanket and an amour, I litter the landscape with the world record
    for consecutive spoken-word ""bitch"" samples.  Take that, France!  Even if the
    beat wasn't so good, the humor of the irony itself is a thing to behold. Later on
    the album, I get back to strings, but with a spin this time-- ""Fuckin' Up the
    Money"" (featuring Huggy) combines strings with a howling vocal background.
    Sounds stark, right, but primed for the dancefloor.  Enjoy!
</p>

  How would your best friends describe you?

<p>
 Well, maybe I've gained a reputation, but it's not as bad as it sounds: ""I went
    out on a date with that asshole [J-Zone] once. He took me to Red Lobster, and
    when the waiter came, he stuck me with the fucking check. He's just mad cuz I
    never gave him any play. Then he tried to talk to my sister a week later-- yeah,
    fuck J-Zone."" (from ""J-Zone Fan Club"")

<i>
  Do you have any special talents?
 </i>
</p>
<p>
 I battle my talking dick (a.k.a. Thug Penis, played by Huggy on the ingenious ""The
    Trojan War""). Last weekend, he got a little pissed that I insisted on unprotected
    sex: ""You better put a hat on my head, before I play dead/ Like I did the last
    time to get us both thrown out of bed."" The prick went so far as to threaten me
    and my nuts with non-performance: ""Even though we're the same age/ I'll cum
    premature and blame it on the balls.""
</p>

</p>
<p>
 Y'all are looking for someone with an underground sound and serious street

    You're sick of MCs pontificating; you know that not every brother has a
    project-sized political chip on his shoulder, and not every one who doesn't is
    named Will Smith.  So if you fine, baby, and you want a master player, write me
    back.  For real.  Im'a get up in that.

    music, cranked up with anger against the Man.  Eugene McDaniels-- ""The Left Rev.
    Mc D""-- has religion in his soul, and you know how wild those guys get.  Just dig
    the Book of Revelations references in ""The Lord Is Back"": ""The lord is mad/ His
    disposition's mean/ He's travelin' the road of mass destruction.""  And this is
    from 1971, so you can bet that racists, hawks and Richard Nixon are at the top of
    His shit list.</p><p>
    
    Any thought that this album is a novelty relic wears off, though, when you realize
    how sincere and frequently great it is. <i>Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse</i>
    has been a lost vinyl classic since it came out thirty years ago, and this reissue
    has been trickling into record stores since sometime last year.  The record is an
    eclectic mix of soul, funk, and even folk, with a crack jazz band backing McDaniels--
    a jazz singer himself in the 60s, and a hit songwriter and producer in the 70s.
    It's attracted less attention and support than the reissue of Shuggie Otis'
    <i>Inspiration Information</i>, but it has its own legend: allegedly, it went out
    of print because Spiro Agnew himself called Atlantic Records to complain about the
    content, and Atlantic stopped promoting the album.</p><p>
    
    This is hard to believe-- Agnew should have had bigger problems than bullying
    artists, but more importantly, McDaniels' lyrics actually sound more concerned
    than angry.  He rages against injustice but he's more interested in hope: even
    as God prepares for Judgment Day, McDaniels reminds us, ""His smile is warm and
    soothing/ As the morning light.""  Rather than targeting anyone to hate, McDaniels
    tries to protect us and warn us, as on the title track: he pleads with warring
    sides-- ""Jews and the Arabs,"" ""Left wing and right wing,"" ""Niggahs and crackers""--
    to get them to see that they're pawns: ""We are the cannon fodder.""  The earnest
    cry of the chorus, ""Better get it together and see what's happening,"" emerges from
    a real love.  On the gorgeous ballad ""Freedom Death Dance"" he chides us for looking
    away: ""Everyone wants piece of mind/ Everybody says we should ignore/ The graves
    we dance upon.""  McDaniels' smooth tenor, while technically not one of the best,
    is direct and empathetic-- he's a preacher, a favorite uncle and the off-the-wall
    guy sitting next to you at the bar.</p><p>
    
    Which is why McDaniels comes across not as an extremist or as some kind of
    character, but as a pretty reasonable guy.  He sings about war, but he also sings
    an acoustic folk song, ""Susan Jane,"" about getting it on with a rich, crazy hippie
    girl; and there's ""Supermarket Blues,"" which recounts how he got in a racially
    motivated fight over a can of peas.  The late-60s/early-70s era also informs
    ""Lovin' Man,"" a song about an extremely mortal Jesus-- a ""sensuality seeker"" whose
    message of spiritual and physical love could get him in trouble with ""the pigs.""
    Yet the album doesn't really sound dated until the last track, ""The Parasite (for
    Buffy)"" (Sainte-Marie?), a ten-minute tribute to the Native Americans that ends
    abruptly in a freak-out: McDaniels starts to scream with horror at their plight
    and the band jumps to frantic noise.  The clamor may be abrupt to modern ears,
    but as always, his heart is in it.</p><p>
    
    As great as the lyrics are, <i>Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse</i>'s resurgence
    can be credited to the terrific music.  The album has been prized and sampled by
    the hip-hop community for years: that ""get it together"" line should be familiar to
    most of you (from the Beastie Boys' <i>Ill Communication</i>, if nothing else) and
    ""Freedom Death Dance"" shows up on the first A Tribe Called Quest album.  McDaniels
    taps some great musicians: the rhythm section includes Gary King (Idris Muhammad,
    George Benson) on electric bass, plus Weather Report members Miroslav Vitous on
    upright and Alphonse Mouzon on drums.  Mouzon particularly stands out, with crisp
    drumwork that's seamlessly integrated but breaks out all over the place.  The band
    can play it smooth on the slower ""Jagger the Dagger"" or ""Freedom Death Dance,"" or
    lift ""Headless Heroes"" on Richie Resnikoff's guitar and Harry Dhitaker's electric
    piano.</p><p>
    
    The album sounds so ebullient, you almost forget that McDaniels' message of love
    comes wrapped around the evils of racism, ethnic conflict and the bomb-- and it's
    that shout at the end of ""The Parasite"" that knocks you awake again, and summons
    up that wrath he was warning about earlier.  All the problems McDaniels sings
    about are still going on, and what was that about Judgment Day coming soon?
    Is Spiro Agnew dead yet?  Maybe it's not too late to save him.</p></div>"|5180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5180-headless-heroes-of-the-apocalypse/|8.7|Chris Dahlen

Fact is, though, Pernice first
    moseyed onto the scene in 1995 as a member of the Scud Mountain Boys, a moderately
    acclaimed alt-country troupe on Sub Pop famous for their break-up-sex anthem
    ""Grudgefuck.""  After three LPs with the Boys, Joe took an artistic side-step into
    the world of classic pop (think the Beach Boys and the Byrds meet Elvis Costello),
    founding the Pernice Brothers. Their first LP, <i>Overcome by Happiness</i>, was
    met by mixed reviews, most somewhat critical of the album's inconsistency. Last
    year's superb <i>The World Won't End</i> silenced the earlier criticism, cutting
    out most of the flat spots from the debut, while retaining and multiplying its
    highs.</p><p>
    Between the two Pernice Brothers releases, however, Joe recorded a couple of
    side projects: Chappaquiddick Skyline and Big Tobacco. Big Tobacco, reissued by
    his Ashmont label in 2001, stands apart from the majority of side projects, mostly
    because it sounds nothing like one. The tunes, although originally slated to
    comprise the fourth Scud Mountain Boys LP, are all instantly reminiscent of the
    Pernice Brothers, except with a little less grandeur (i.e. no string arrangements),
    and an even more apparent moodiness.</p><p>
    One of the most welcome similarities is the production quality. Pernice's bandmate,
    Thom Monahan, produced Big Tobacco (with Joe's assistance), and shows a keen ear
    for classic pop, directing firm, clear rhythm lines and complementary guitar
    accompaniment. The simplicity in the background places all of the focus on Joe's
    voice (a great one), melodies and lyrics. This is also where the album either
    rises or falls.</p><p>
    The opener, ""Prince Valium,"" is one of the stronger tracks on the disc, employing
    a very familiar four-chord progression and a song-structure a bit more dynamic
    than most on the album (like the tasteful bridge where the band cuts out, leaving
    only drums and six-string acoustic). The chorus is also a winner, both the peppy
    melody and Pernice's typically somber lyrics (""Because the cure is long in coming,
    and it never lasts so long/ Guess a little was just a little too much to ask you
    for/ Always knew you'd be going, but I did not know just when/ So help me, Lord,
    get me stoned again"").</p><p>
    ""Bum Leg"" is another good one, spinning a convincing story of violence and despair
    (""Got a rattle in my chest, the way it sounds, like a barrel full of broken bottles
    rolling the through the night, hitting every fucking pothole in this town"") over
    western-flavored orchestration that somehow avoids sounding clichéd.  The opening
    to ""Undertow"" replaces the kit with kettle drums, which, with a Beatles-esque
    guitar progression, forms an odd but successful rhythm track. The strength of the
    song, as usual, comes with the lyrics: ""Stuck in the undertow/ Stuck in a rut you
    dug all your own/ Too high to make it home and you fall/ Anywhere you're standing/
    It's never going to be that easy again/ From now they always go down screaming/
    Once you could hide it well, now it shows/ Everybody knows the bloom is off the
    rose.""  Even when nothing else goes right, Pernice's lyrics almost bail him out
    on their own.  The man has a way with words.</p><p>
    If you've heard Joe Pernice, you know what you're getting with Big Tobacco--
    lyrics-focused classic pop, delivered by a talented songwriter and wordsmith. The
    collection of tunes here may not be quite as punchy or seamless as those on <i>The
    World Won't End</i>, but they're still a solid, palatable bunch.</p></div>"|6242.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6242-big-tobacco/|7.0|Brad Haywood

As he starts to sing
    Marty Robbins' ""El Paso,"" his voice barely lifts above a whisper; the acoustic
    guitar strums lightly, poignantly behind him.  You sense that drummer Joe
    Convertino is wearing a suit, and that it looks really sharp.  The melodrama of
    this gunfighter ballad comes through, but suavely, and even when Gelb stops in
    the middle to shred through Neil Young's ""Out on the Weekend,"" it still sounds
    bad-ass.</p><p>
    
    Giant Sand is Howe Gelb's one-man-band, plus guests.  Operating out of Tucson,
    Arizona, Giant Sand has been performing original material since the mid-80s that
    loosely sits in the camps of rock and alt-country.  Their latest album, <i>Cover
    Magazine</i>, is a cover album of classic (and kitschy) country and rock songs.
    This kind of record is usually dismissed as a second-tier project-- just like
    live albums, and for basically the same reason: going in, you're not expecting a
    major, original statement.  It's true that Gelb never sounds like he's breaking a
    sweat here, but there's invention and heart in these tunes, and the range is
    impressive-- stretching from Marty Robbins and Johnny Cash to P.J. Harvey and
    Goldfrapp.</p><p>
    
    The biggest selling point here is the cover of Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man,"" which
    Gelb reworks into a conga-padded lounge number.  His understated and dead serious
    vocals make the lyrics sound extra bizarre (""Heavy boots of lead/ Fill his victims
    full of dread""), and the hook is catchy on piano.  The second most entertaining
    cover is Sonny and Cher's ""The Beat Goes On,"" his take on which seems particularly
    ""knowing.""  This version is slicker and has a better rhythm than the original,
    thanks largely to Joe Burns' bass; Gelb's wife Sofia-- dig the parallel?-- adds
    wry backup vocals.</p><p>
    
    Gelb tackles most of the instruments himself, but he's joined by some impressive
    guests.  On X's ""Johnny Hit and Run Pauline"" his guitar goes from a tense quiet
    to a blaring fury, and P.J. Harvey sings on the chorus, her wail dripping with
    blood.  Gelb also covers one of Harvey's songs, a bluesy performance of ""Plants
    and Rags""; the untreated electric guitar sounds like it was recorded out in the
    garage.  Most of the songs use the rhythm section of Burns on upright bass and
    Convertino on drums, and they're terrific: Burns' bassline on ""King of the Road""
    is big and easy-going on this only mildly down-and-out version of the classic.</p><p>
    
    Although the performance of Johnny Cash's ""I'm Leaving Now (Adios)"" is too casual--
    this is the only song where the vocals drop from impromptu to half-assed-- Burns
    and Convertino still sound like they rolled right out of Sun Studio.  The last
    two numbers (not counting a silly reprise of ""The Beat Goes On"") are live recordings
    with members of Grandaddy.  These tunes cover more familiar territory for Gelb:
    former Giant Sand member Rainer Ptacek's ""The Inner Flame,"" and an expanded
    version of Gelb's ""Blue Marble Girl"" that's sprawling and gorgeous, riding on
    his keyboards and Jim Fairchild's massive guitar.</p><p>
<i>Cover Magazine</i> is a diverse album that holds together well.  The sound
    quality is solid, and some of the recordings have a vast atmosphere, particularly
    that dead-of-night desert setting for ""El Paso.""  The record never escapes being
    a ""cover album,"" mainly because Gelb takes most of the songs so easily.  But the
    point of the album seems to be to let him play entertainer-- from the raw but
    theatrical ""Johnny Hit and Run Pauline"" to that piano line on ""Iron Man"" that'll

I hate his damn fool ten-minute long post-home run
    interpretive dance.  I hate his damn fool TV commercials for his damn fool video
    game (""It's soo reeeeeal!!!"").  I hate his damn fool ""I love baseball!  I'm
    friends with everybody!"" locker room interviews.   And I <i>still</i> hate Sammy
    Sosa, even now that he's surprisingly begun making strange slow-core records on
    his home computer.  With all his millions of dollars, you would think he could
    afford some better... [squinting] hey, wait a second, this says Saso, not Sosa.
    Damn this dyslexia!</p><p>
    
    Well, I don't know nothing about this Saso, but the name conjures images of a
    Chris Kattan-like male stripper, if you say it with enough flash.  The liner
    notes don't help any, as it's unclear whether the Saso entity is a group
    (""instrumentation and arrangements by Saso""), or the solitary project of one
    man (""music/noises and words by Jim Lawler"") and his budget-class recording
    equipment.  The Saso website is no help, either, consisting mainly of
    not-very-original modem-crashing Shockwave design.  Even a Google search failed
    me, providing only the name of Saso Janfuski, a ""chorus"" performer on some Pink
    Floyd tribute album from 2000.</p><p>
    
    The music on <i>Big Group Hug</i> is just as mystifying, since Saso himself/itself
    doesn't appear to know what the hell he/it is.  The opening title track is a
    washed-out canvas of melancholy pop with Yorkeishly high vocals floating over a
    soft bed of simple acoustic guitar, keyboards, and lightly tapped drums.  But the
    second track, ""Bird Brain,"" is a lengthy and stagnant instrumental that, at one
    point, head-scratchingly throws in a ""Seinfeld"" sample.  And ""Blood Bath"" switches
    gears again, with diet Neu!.  What gives?</p><p>
    
    One clue to Saso's identity may lie in the sonic continuity between the album's
    ten songs-- namely, the mid-fi bedroom-recluse feel.  Most instruments are
    recorded as if from under a pillow, with the tone uniformly fuzzy and warm like a
    Rhodes electric piano.  Songs are usually left sparse: ""Dimwit"" and ""All My Life""
    appear drumless, while ""Dripfeed"" contains little more than piano and voice.</p><p>
    
    But one could argue that things are left overly scanty, as the majority of the
    album breezes by without leaving any debris lodged in my memory.  The instrumental
    tracks generally don't do enough to justify their existence, and the melodramatic
    vocals on ""Somebody"" aren't much of an improvement.  Occasionally, however, this
    Saso produces some ear-catching sounds, like the <i>Vespertine</i> music box
    opening of ""My Brain Hurts,"" and the unexpected stomp in the middle of ""Lazy Bones.""</p><p>
    
    Too bad these elements aren't packaged into actual songs instead of coming across
    as a series of portfolio pieces for somebody's potential producer(s)/bandmate(s).
    Looking for that woody, organic, intimate Microphones sound, but can't afford Phil
    Elvrum?  Call Saso!  He or They is cheap!  Unless, of course, Saso really is Sosa.
    I wouldn't put it past the bastard.</p></div>"|7001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7001-big-group-hug/|5.4|Rob Mitchum

    output. His work is guided by his ""Contract for the Composition of Music""
    manifesto, a kind of Dogma 95-style treatise on music-making in the information
    age. Herbert frowns on sampling other music, synthesizer pre-sets, and drum
    machines, and gives the thumbs-up to human error (his 2000 mix CD is titled
    <i>Let's All Make Mistakes</i>). His self-imposed limitations have driven him to
    include a certain amount of acoustic instrumentation, including his own
    accomplished piano work, while pointing him toward unusual sound sources for his
    rhythmic sequencing.</p><p>
    
    On 2001's overlooked gem <i>Bodily Functions</i>, he borrowed some of the sound
    sources Matmos used on <i>A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure</i>, made his own
    recordings of organic phenomena, and incorporated the lot into subtle, elegant
    pop music that alternated between effortless house tracks and vaguely loungy
    acoustic jazz. When I first heard <i>Bodily Functions</i> I almost couldn't
    believe how good it was, but when I looked to others to share my enthusiasm,
    the responses were decidedly mixed. Some heard genius in the album; others failed
    to connect with Herbert at all, while still others praised his earlier <i>Around
    the House</i> album as vastly superior. As fate would have it, <i>Around the
    House</i>, originally released in 1998, has now been reissued.</p><p>
    
    If <i>Bodily Functions</i> had some stylistic parallels with Matmos' <i>A Chance
    to Cut</i>, <i>Around the House</i> is more closely aligned with the San Francisco
    duo's <i>Quasi Objects</i>. As on that early Matmos effort, Herbert integrated the
    sounds of objects in and around his home into his songs. The comparisons should
    really stop there, though, because Herbert's musical goals are completely different.
    Herbert is a song man bent on crafting relaxed, tasteful and ultimately very
    danceable tunes, and his use of the field recordings differs sharply. Unlike
    Matmos, Herbert has no respect for the integrity of the sources and shows little
    interest in using the original context as a reference point. The effect of whatever
    esoteric sampling methods are used are essentially inaudible on <i>Around the
    House</i>, but what emerges loud and clear is another exceptional and creative
    album.</p><p>
    
    As on the later <i>Bodily Functions</i>, the songs on <i>Around the House</i> are
    voiced by the sultry Dani Siciliano. She sings on just under half the tracks, and
    the rest consist of either instrumental house numbers (still rife with vocal
    samples) or moodier, more experimental pieces.  The album's highlight comes early
    in the form of ""So Now..."", its first real track after a short bit of ambient
    foolery. Even after hearing it 30 times or more in the last week, this song has
    me hitting the ""back"" button like a Skinnerian pigeon aching for a food pellet.
    It has a lush and spacious rhythmic backdrop, comprised of little more than a
    clicking pseudo-snare, a house thump and a simple, round bassline. But the vocals
    are what make it special. The call-and-response interplay between Siciliano's
    lead and the breathy backup singers is gorgeous, the kind of music I imagine
    Prince composing after God finally calls the Purple One 2 Heaven.</p><p>
    
    Almost as accomplished is the sunny, uptempo ""Going Round,"" which alludes just
    slightly to the jazz fixation that would flower on <i>Bodily Functions</i>. Even
    more instructive for these comparisons is ""The Last Beat,"" which appears in
    different forms on both albums. As is typical of the differences between the two
    records, the version here is a bit more electronic and focused on ambience-- the
    full-on torch song approach that marks the most recent record was more of a flicker
    at this stage.  In lieu of gently brushed cymbals, the song gives a percussive
    shape to a tangle of static.</p><p>
    
    A handful of brilliant tracks stand out on the remainder of the album, from
    light, warm and just-plain-beautiful instrumental house (""Close to Me,"" ""We
    Still Have (The Music)"") to gurgling ambient tracks thick with nuanced sound
    design and brilliant arrangements (""We Go Wrong""), to tracks that morph from one
    mode into the next (""This Time""). I would not personally rate <i>Around the House</i>
    quite as high as <i>Bodily Functions</i>, but this could well be a matter of which
    record I heard first. Herbert was a bit more focused on sound than song on this
    record, but the overall approach is not markedly different. Both albums are loaded
    with music of exceptionally high quality.</p></div>"|3835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3835-around-the-house/|8.7|Mark Richard-San

    Madonna-esque accessories to capture the imaginations of the MTV generation. The
    Rockers were an all-female proposition (though, if memory serves, Rocker Ken had
    some vague role-- drummer, perhaps?), and each doll came with a plastic instrument
    and an EP-length cassette tape featuring mass-produced, semi-new wave songs about
    loving to rock. The fortunate girl could get the entire set-up (all the band
    members, the stage, the backdrop, etc.), play the tape, and live out rock and
    roll fantasies.  Me, I only had two rockers: Barbie and the brunette bassist,
    whatever her name was.  My best friend and I would gather all our rocker paraphernalia
    and stage elaborate concerts for her brother's action figures. In retrospect, these
    events had a decidedly Woodstock flair, as He-Man, G.I. Joe, Boba Fett, and the
    stray Transformer put aside their differences and came together to enjoy Barbie's
    Greatest Hits.</p><p>
    I don't know if the All Girl Summer Fun Band has quite the same unifying effect,
    though one might imagine their shows as places where ex-riot grrls, giggly
    teenage hipsters, closet pedophiles, sensitive indie rock boys, and misogynists
    inclined toward muttering, ""I told you so."" And it wouldn't be much of a stretch
    to suggest that these Portland girls resemble a lo-fi Barbie and the Rockers:
    four girls of slightly differing appearances playing cute, G-rated songs about
    cute boys in cute little girl voices.  And it's all informed by 60s Brill Building
    Girl-Group pop, replete with nods to Brian Wilson.  Their music pushes the outside
    parameters of twee, and ushers the listener into a fantastic world where all the
    girls giggle and blush at attention, wear polka-dot bikinis and sparkly barrettes,
    and never kiss and tell.</p><p>
    I'm 99% sure the members of the Summer Fun Band are cognizant of the image they're
    sending out, and I'm positive they expect the listener to enjoy the implicit ironies
    and delight in the retro-pop sensibilities while imagining the simpler, pre-Riot
    Grrl days. It's not exactly campy (that would entail maintenance of the beehive
    hairdos suggested by the salon hairdryer cover art), nor particularly original.
    Fans of bare-bones pop music might love this-- it's innocuous enough and, as the
    name suggests, summery and fun.</p><p>
<i>All Girl Summer Fun Band</i> offers thirteen short songs (reminiscent of Cub
    without the crunch), featuring a minimal three-chord, mid-tempo song structure
    that varies only on the album's two slow numbers, ""Somehow Angels"" and ""Girl #3.""
    Beyond that, there's not much to say.  ""Theme Song,"" admittedly, features one of
    the best unanticipated screams I've heard following a bubble-gum chorus of, ""We're
    the All Girl Summer Fun Band/ La la la la la la.""  And ""It's There"" provides a
    slight variation on the album's continually recycled song structure by tossing in
    a nice jazzy chorus over which the girls intone, ""Shooby-doo, I've got a crush on
    you."" No point in getting into the lyrics beyond that, though-- you get the point.</p><p>
    For the record, I don't have a problem with this kind of über-simplistic music.
    In fact, I'm a long time defender of rock and pop music in its purest, three-chord
    forms. But the girls' overt reliance on self-conscious cuteness really rubs me
    wrong-- the faux-prepubescent vocals and the coy, deliberately off-key harmonies
    grate like the Swiss cheese sentiments inherent in the banal lyrics.  And maybe my
    problem is a bit political, too.  Women in rock (and particularly women within
    the male-dominated indie rock sect) are already faced with enough patronizing
    bullshit, and the All Girl Summer Fun Band not only feeds this mentality, but
    knowingly plays up to it.</p><p>
    Of course, it could be I'm just too old for the kind of all-girl summer fun this
    band claims to deliver.  But the truth is, if I want to listen to shameless pop
    with an estrogen twist, I'm much more inclined to reach for Destiny's Child.
    Their music may be equally insipid, but at least you can dance to it.</p></div>"|113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/113-all-girl-summer-fun-band/|4.5|Alison Fields

    that Aphex helped to build. Though he's not released anything
    significant on the label, the Aphex ghost wanders nightly
    through its halls. Sometimes that spectral presence is so
    strong that people are ready to mistake artists entirely
    unrelated to Aphex as being him by another name. Johnny Hawk,
    who records under the wahoo Global Goon alias is a victim of
    mistaken identity. Hawk's debut album, 1996's <i>Goon</i>, was
    widely credited to Aphex.  Guess it didn't bug him.</p><p>
    
    But just a cursory listen to <i>Goon</i> would have let the
    secret out that Global Goon and Aphex were not born from the
    same pod; Hawk doesn't share Aphex's appreciation for modern
    composition and freak-out. That album, while absurd, owes
    more to the slo-mo wing of Braindance than to the splattercore
    cadre.  Its opening track, ""St. Michael"" is the IDM cousin of
    the Fall's ""Birmingham School of Business School""-- both share
    a straight-faced Dadaist's reading of university course
    catalogs. ""Synchropeet"" is a ploddingly accompanied vocal raga
    for the Mogadon-dependent.</p><p>
    
    Hawk's follow-up to <i>Goon</i>, <i>Cradle of History</i>,
    collected twenty Casio melodies and confirmed his position
    within the lightly comic section of the Braindance organization.
    Now, with his third album, <i>Vatican Nitez</i>, Hawk deftly
    combines these two threads together to produce an amalgam of
    absurdly faux-naif tuneful IDM.</p><p>
<i>Vatican Nitez</i> doesn't waste time with an intro (hooray!)--
    it's straight into ""Business Man"" and into forty minutes of
    smile-inducing nuttiness.  One of the first noticeable differences
    between this and earlier works is that it sounds as though Hawk's
    got access to much better equipment these days. The album
    doesn't sound cheap-- a gimmick that long ago lost its currency.
    Because he's no longer obscured by hiss, I can fully appreciate
    the Goon's concealed artistry. ""Jerky Dharma"" turns a dalliance
    with vaguely Asian tonalities into something much less
    patronizing. During ""I'm on the 73,"" Hawk attempts to conceal
    his invention by sending every musical element through an
    immense echo chamber. Despite his most ardent efforts, you can
    easily discern his idiosyncratic skill. ""Kreem Ballet"" sums up
    in five minutes all seven studio volumes of Pete Namlook's
    <i>Dark Side of the Moog</i> series, and further slaps down
    Namlook with a first-rate <i>No Pussyfooting</i> impression.</p><p>
    
    The mid-tempo mystery named ""Stan's Slaves"" possesses such a
    powerful undertow that I'd love to hear what Hawk could do in
    collaboration with Goldfrapp. ""!"" carries on the exploration
    of tidal currents, adding whistling and woodblock percussion.
    But by the time the album gets to ""Scott Cronce Is the CEO,""
    Hawk has lost steam. The swathes of ambience and the rope-thick
    Tubeway Army tune totally crush the generic hip-hop beats
    underneath. Hawk heaps some analog squiggles on top in a vain
    effort to distinguish the track. ""Globy Dubes, Champeen of All
    Americky"" nearly suffers from the same malady. But Hawk ends
    up correcting previous error by shooting nervy break-neck
    sequencer lines through the plodding hip-hop and the squiggles.</p><p>
    
    Though Hawk's latest suggests that spending some chill-out
    time with John Paul II isn't as awkward as I'd have suspected,
    <i>Vatican Nitez</i> is far from revolutionary. Unlike former
    labelmate, Leila, Hawk isn't trying to redefine a sound. If
    you're satisfied with that, <i>Vatican Nitez</i> is a
    satisfying enough means of cerebral exertion.</p></div>"|3467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3467-vatican-nitez/|7.0|Paul Cooper

    albums since the late 80s, there's not a single Muslimgauze review in the
    Pitchfork archive. It's a matter of timing, really. Bryn Jones died before our
    site started covering electronic music in a serious way, and the labels he
    recorded for (Extreme, Staalplaat, and many others) never happened to appear
    on the promo radar. So until a massive reissue project gets underway, the
    official artist website remains the definitive source for information about
    the mysterious Muslimgauze.</p><p>
 I bring up the late, great Muslimgauze not because of all the interesting things
    happening in the Arab world (is anyone else almost glad that Bryn Jones didn't
    live to see the post-September 11th political landscape?), but because I hear
    something familiar in this excellent new album by British hip-hop aficionado
    Req. It's not the tone, but the method that strikes a chord. Muslimgauze was so
    prolific in part because his pieces tended to be simple in construction. They
    were often built on the foundation of a single perfectly crafted loop, over which
    Jones would splatter bits of noise and various dub-derived mixing effects.</p><p>
 Req also gets serious mileage out of a lone repeating loop, and he shows a similar
    affinity for a rough and ragged analog sound laced with simple melodic motifs.
    There's a spirited rawness to
 <i>
  Sketchbook
 </i>
 that's both disarming and
    immediately engaging; though elements feel familiar, the tone here is striking
    and unconventional. Hip-hop is an obvious touchstone, but even the most minimal
    hip-hop production feels thick and cluttered next to Req's naked approach. Though
    Req has released two albums via big beat imprint Skint, on the evidence of strange
    and wonderful
 <i>
  Sketchbook
 </i>
 , he'll surely feel much more at home at the more
    experimental Warp.
</p><p>
 A handful of interesting Aphexian ambient interludes pop up on this record, but
    the rhythm tracks are its heart and soul. Some of these pieces consist of nothing
    but a tom-tom, a bass drum, a hi-hat and the faintest hint of a chord. ""Dolby C""
    could almost come from a break record, such is its relentlessly stripped-down
    approach to rhythm. It's uncanny how a track so ""not there"" can remain so
    in-your-face and hypnotic.  Just as good is ""Upstairs,"" with its rusty, Brian
    Deck-like junkyard beats and a strange vibraphone melody repeating periodically.
    The percussion on these tracks is bone-dry and bass heavy, with a thud that hits
    like a fist to the solar plexus.
</p>
<p>
 When Req decided to add more elements to this sound, his inspiration can come
    from anywhere, which keeps the record exciting. Not tied to any theme or style,
    the pieces are free to veer off into uncharted textural territory. ""Sketchies
    Death Track"" adds a shaker, a Chinese gong, and a thumb piano to a loose, tribal
    beat, and ""I Seek"" is fat-bottomed hip-hop with an ominous three-note piano riff
    that would do the RZA proud. ""Something"" is nothing more than a closely miked
    drum kit, some kind of melodic percussion bit, and a sample of a vocal drone
    somewhere deep in the background, while ""AMPEG 18 KHZ"" is a seriously compressed
    funk beat with hand percussion, and some odd accordion stabs. The development
    throughout each track is slight but effective, always keeping you tuned in to
    hear what happens next.
</p>
<p>
 I've no doubt
 <i>
  Sketchbook
 </i>
 will be too coarse for some folks, but there is
    something special happening here. Most music-- even most great music-- consists
    of slight variations on well-established themes, and it's difficult to find an
    album that sounds truly new.
 <i>
  Sketchbook
 </i>
 is such a record.

Even their name has no hard consonant
    sounds.  Their music-- a mushy combination of folksy rock and
    avant-pop-- squishes between your fingers as you dig for a
    clear hook or a percussive sound.  The members of the band
    have obvious talent and a lot of ideas, but everything sinks
    into a pleasing ambience.  It splats against your ears like
    the spineless sea creatures that crawl across its back cover.</p><p>
    
    The members of the Leels-- Floridians Trey Connor of Meringue,
    and Home alumni Chris Sturgeon and Eric Morrison-- split the
    singing, songwriting and instrumental work.  Each of the
    fourteen songs has its own, creative sound: the guitar and
    vocal effects on ""{</p><p>{}}}</p><p>{{},"" the lilting, lush melody of
    ""Arbor Day,"" or Sandra Shockley-Laden's gossamer flute backdrop
    on ""Throttle.""  ""Floridian Towel,"" with its strong chorus and
    guest Drew Blomquist's crisp drumwork, sounds like it could
    fit on the first Sea and Cake album, though the Leels don't
    reach that band's stealthy efficiency.</p><p>
    
    Even though the ideas are impressive, it takes several listens
    to appreciate them.  The album has an appealing sound-- slightly
    wistful, slightly ironic-- but it's not striking, and the
    instruments sound like they're wrapped in gauze: ""Throttle""
    goes down so easily that you can overlook its best qualities.
    The production may appeal to people who like the carefully
    produced haze of, say, the Flaming Lips, but the Lips have
    more electricity.  Maybe it's too easy nowadays to overlook
    nice moments like the clarinet solos on ""Be a Part of It,""
    but the experimentation on this album almost seems <i>de
    rigueur</i>, and the inventiveness doesn't convey any
    excitement.</p><p>
    
    The more straightforward songs are also a little limp: the
    breezy indie pop of ""Fortunesized"" and ""Mandatory Highsteppers""
    has been done better elsewhere, and the classic rock material--
    ""Odessa,"" which could have come straight off <i>Workingman's
    Dead</i>, or the cover of Van Morrison's ""Precious Time""--
    doesn't have the sharp vocals or crunchy guitar strumming that
    the style requires.  The Leels let loose near the end, trying
    to milk a rock crescendo from the song ""Sailing Sister."" But
    between the lethargic vocals and the somewhat muffled guitar
    line, it never takes off; listening to it is like watching a
    three-legged dog jump for a frisbee.</p><p>
    
    The chorus of ""Sailing Sister"" also demonstrates the band's
    biggest weakness: the singing, and especially the harmonies.
    On songs like ""Odessa,"" the vocals are indistinct and whiny,
    and they warble out of pitch; the harmony parts are off-kilter
    and painful.  Many vocalists-- including the Lips' Wayne Coyne--
    turn out great performances with (arguably) weak pipes, and
    the Leels have a resemblance to some other vocal anti-heroes,
    such as Neil Young or Jerry Garcia.  However, singers like
    these show more personality.</p><p>
    
    The Leels aren't as expressive:
    sometimes they sound like they're singing from the living
    room couch, and other times they use too much ironic detachment.
    On ""Closer to Be,"" Morrison can't even get a rise out of the

A lot of
    times, we hear something as pretty simply because we're
    conditioned that way.  Frequently, beauty and grandeur are the
    result of careful planning and composing, like Samuel Barber's
    ""Adagio for Strings"" or Vivaldi's summer violin concerto.  I
    suppose there are certain cliches that have emerged in Western
    music as it's gradually become codified into a system of keys
    and chords and standard arrangements that we've collectively
    come to view as ""ugly"" and ""beautiful.""  The way we listen to
    music is defined by our cultural surroundings, and our
    surroundings tell us that minor keys are sad and major keys
    are happy (generally speaking).</p><p>
    
    On the other end of the spectrum, there's a different kind of
    beauty to found in less strictly composed, more free-flowing
    music.  You can hear it in Shuggie Otis' ""Freedom Flight""
    or the first track on Boredoms' <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i>.
    There's a certain point where some improvised music suddenly
    ceases to be subject to pretense-- it's just there and you
    take it for what it is.  On a personal level, I think this is
    why I find listening to Japanese koto music and Javanese gamelan
    orchestras to be somewhat liberating.  Somewhere in all that
    sound, you can catch a rather vivid glimpse of the soul of the
    person or people playing it.</p><p>
    
    Naturally, I enjoy both music that's intricately composed and
    music that's totally free of any compositional guidance.  <i>A
    Feather in the Engine</i>, David Kilgour's fourth solo album
    (excluding his mid-90s compilation of demos, <i>First Steps
    and False Alarms</i>), plays something like a meeting point
    between the two ends of the spectrum.  On the one hand, you
    have several smartly written psychedelic pop songs, ensconced
    in the traditions of Kiwi rock that Kilgour's own band, the
    Clean, helped establish.  On the other, you have a handful of
    simply gorgeous off-the-cuff guitar instrumentals that
    transcend any other little subgenre distinctions you could
    apply to Kilgour's music.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with one of these instrumentals, a meandering,
    meditative track called ""Sept. '98"" that makes me want to get
    out a good throw rug, find a mantra and have a good moment of
    escape from my oft-overbearing superego.  Kilgour's guitar
    lines seem to flow with his stream of consciousness, and the
    several overdubbed parts combine for a shimmer effect.  An
    unassuming organ interjects now and then with quasi-melodic
    phrases that provide a good contrast to the simple themes
    Kilgour works out on his guitar.  One urgently strummed
    passage even recalls Jorma Kaukonen's ""Embryonic Journey""
    from Jefferson Airplane's <i>Surrealistic Pillow</i>.</p><p>
    
    The album moves from there to the quirky pastoral psych-pop
    of ""Slippery Slide,"" full of tumbling piano flourishes,
    percussive, plucked bass, and relaxed acoustic strumming.
    Kilgour's singing isn't exactly what you'd call world-class,
    but his subdued tenor works just about perfectly for this kind
    of thing.  ""All the Rest"" follows with a more focused pop hook
    and a strong backbeat.  Kilgour doesn't pay much mind to
    traditional pop song structure in his writing, though, and
    this songs is no exception, as he lays into his wah pedal for
    an extended midsection that provides the record with one of
    its Clean-est moments.</p><p>
    
    Several other songs follow fairly well-paved paths, such as
    the fine acoustic ""The Perfect Watch"" or ""Wooden Shed,"" but
    the three best songs come consecutively near the end.  ""Today
    Is Gonna Be Mine"" is an exultant blast of prime Flying Nun
    brand pop-- ramshackle, yet somehow also propulsive.  ""I Caught
    You"" opens with a ""Venus in Furs"" drone, some repetitive piano
    motives and a detached Kilgour singing, ""I've got you inside
    my head,"" before cutting into a slippery bass groove courtesy
    of frequent Kilgour collaborator Noel Ward over thumping drums.</p><p>
    
    ""Instra 2 Reprise"" follows, and though its title may make it
    sound like a tossed-off interlude, it's anything but.  Kilgour
    delivers one of his best vocal performances over subtle
    percussion, wah-drenched guitar and a string arrangement by
    Graeme Downes of the Verlaines.  The string quartet is
    masterfully scored to provide counterpoint to Kilgour's vocals
    during verses and melodic material between the verses.  Brief,
    eastern-sounding descending lines alternate with Copeland-esque
    crescendos with a swooping violin lead.  It's truly fantastic
    stuff that succeeds brilliantly without really conforming to
    any traditional sense of structure.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there are also more of those splendid little
    instrumentals to be found, like ""Instra 2,"" an acoustic 12
    string guitar and tack piano interlude obviously influenced
    by the music of South Asia.  Kilgour rattles off sitar-like
    runs with ease and keeps the harmony ambiguous.  The album
    closes with ""Backwards Forwards,"" which centers all of its
    varied wandering around a few central chords, relying on a
    simple cadence to bring everything full circle at regular
    intervals.  A distant drum machine provides a pace for the
    proceedings, which find Kilgour alternately exploring textured
    strumming and slow, surf-styled leads dripping in reverb.</p><p>
<i>A Feather in the Wind</i> is actually a bit too brief at 38
    minutes, and you'll barely feel the passage of time while
    listening to it.  Complaints are hard to come by, as there's
    really not a single unpleasant moment on the entire album.
    That said, though thoroughly enjoyable, the album isn't always
    riveting, either, and occasionally the attention does stray.
    But that's hardly a reason not to throw it on when you need
    to chill out after a long day now is it?  Kilgour has managed
    to craft an album that unleashes a hefty dose of beauty on the
    world, and that's something we can always use.</p></div>"|4421.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4421-a-feather-in-the-engine/|8.0|Joe Tangari

    I used to firmly believe that as technology made things easier, quality would
    improve.  I'm not sure now how I ever came to hold this foolish belief.  Maybe it
    was too much pro-tech sci-fi as a kid, or maybe a naïve believe in the democratizing
    effects of computers that somehow was carried over into the realm of art. At any
    rate, the bottom line is, I was wrong. Computer recording technology, by making it
    essentially as easy to release a CD as it is to bathe your dog, has only increased
    the amount of shit being put out. Lest there be any doubt, go to any used bin in
    the country.  And as further proof, I offer up this CD from Nate Denver's Neck.</p><p>
    Someone, somewhere, at some point in the whole process, should have stopped this
    from ever reaching my desk.  What's being aimed at here (presumably) is a skewed
    children's album of electro/folk interspersed with sound collages and spoken word
    field recordings-- a fairly admirable goal, but the main problem is that it's
    carried off in such a mindless fashion that <i>Prepare to Die</i> teeters from
    mildly annoying to completely unlistenable over the course of 39 tiring minutes.</p><p>
    The other main problem is that the album can't make up its mind whether it wants
    to be comedy/novelty album, or an album exploring ""deep"" philosophical questions
    (the kind of questions that tend to come up amongst friends in a college dormitory
    at about the time the last cold brews are being sipped). This lack of focus makes
    for an album that's neither very funny, nor very intellectually penetrating.</p><p>
    There are a few cheap laughs like a muzak-like tribute to Slayer's ""Raining Blood,""
    and ""Smashoptomus,"" the story of a childhood toy come back for revenge after its
    owner grows up and locks it in the closet for years. But, at it's best, <i>Prepare
    to Die</i> sounds like a particularly uninspired Ween jerk-off studio session. The
    most perplexing thing is that the label which released this is run by none other
    than Mick Turner of the Dirty Three. The Marquis de Tren himself, whose music I
    love. Maybe he owed the guy a favor or something. Seriously, Mick, let's have some
    standards here.</p></div>"|5715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5715-prepare-to-die/|1.9|Jason Nickey

That was the perfect
    name for its haunted post-folk, what with the sharp guitar chords, the percussion
    rumbling like uncontrollable spirits and Jason Molina's disconsolate wail.  But
    each of his works as Songs: Ohia is a different beast, taking shape around the
    group of musicians he's currently working with.  So I was a bit hesitant when I
    heard about the new album, which was recorded in Philadelphia with Jim Krewson
    and Jennie Benford of Jim and Jennie and the Pinetops, amongst other musicians.
    I wanted more of the <i>Ghost Tropic</i> sound-- a fractured structure just this
    side of collapse-- but here they were recording songs live in one take, with no
    overdubs, and garnering comparisons to the warmth of the Muscle Shoals Studio
    recordings during the 1970s.</p><p>
    Within one listen, <i>Didn't It Rain</i> convinced me that it was worth paying
    attention to its own terms.  Songs: Ohia's compositions have a strange way of
    warping time for the listener.  How else could the opening title track slip by me
    after nearly eight minutes?  It begins in a slow progression of acoustic chords,
    and almost immediately Molina is singing about the eye of the storm, and those
    caught under its downpour.  The chorus wells up with trilling guitar notes and
    Jennie Benford providing backing vocals, and Molina warns, ""If you think you got
    it/ They're gonna beat it out of you/ Through work and debt.""  Calling a recording
    ""intimate"" can be cliché, but I swear you can practically hear the floorboards
    creaking.  The song swells and sighs for minutes like a vintage Neil Young ballad,
    until right near the end when Molina asks the question in the song title.</p><p>
    I thought that <i>Didn't It Rain</i> might be more light of heart, like some of
    the Palace records Songs: Ohia is often compared to.  In the previous song, Molina
    asks the group audibly to bring it back for another chorus, and it doesn't detract
    from the music at all.  But it seems his tropical depression has lingered, despite
    titles like ""Steve Albini's Blues"" and ""Cross the Road, Molina.""  The former lopes
    along deliberately, the pace set by banjo-like plinks and made more tense by the
    relative silence that pervades.  Molina, Benford and Krewson join together to sing,
    ""See its sulfury shine/ See the big city moon/ 'Tween the radio tower/ 'Tween the
    big diesel rigs.""  Reviewers often mention Molina's blue-collar background, but
    I'm not going to try to prove anyone's cred.  Someone (probably Krewson) howls
    the line ""see the big city moon"" again, and the last-dime desperation in his
    twangy voice is authenticity enough.</p><p>
    There's a shared imagery that becomes evident, especially on ""Ring the Bell"" and
    ""Cross the Road, Molina,"" two songs in the middle of the album that flow together
    as a conceptual piece.  It's here that Molina might seem too far gone in gloom,
    as he begs, ""Show us how bad we're outnumbered,"" but the compositions never reach
    the Gormenghastly nature of ""apocalyptic folk"" groups like Death in June.  There's
    a bleak beauty in the arc of the amped electric strings, and when the Chicago moon
    ""swings like a blade,"" Molina may even be painting himself as the Andalusian dog.
    You can trace the lyrical themes: light, darkness, the moon, fire, Chicago.  Those
    themes are evoked again on ""Two Blue Lights,"" a brief blues piece about the light
    from a bus and the moon, about hell and your hometown.  Is it the scraping sounds
    of the frets that make it so earthy and uplifting?</p><p>
    I'll throw my cards down now: ""Blue Factory Flame"" is a classic.  Drum-kit
    percussion enters for the first time, setting a steady 4/4 frame as Molina asks,
    ""When I die, put my bones in an empty street/ Bring a Coleman lantern and a radio/
    A Cleveland game and a fishing pole.""  The black-hearted procession continues as
    he describes ghostly iron ore ships coming home, and climaxes in the refrain
    ""paralyzed by emptiness.""  It's as apt a summary of depression's effects as I've
    heard, and the electric guitar emits a stark, weathered sort of sadness.</p><p>
    Musically, ""Blue Chicago Moon"" evokes more of that aged Rust Belt atmosphere, but
    Molina admits that you're not helpless when you're hunted by the blues, and he
    calls out over and over for you to ""try to beat it, try to beat it.""  From the
    first song, it seems that <i>Didn't It Rain</i> is intended as a bulwark against
    sorrow, and that commitment appears again on this last track.  The compositions
    here are elemental, filled with flame as well as steel and stone, and they tie
    Molina's native Ohio together with his current home, Chicago.  In the process of
    recording another incredible album, he's discovered that light is most visible
    when it's flickering alone in the dark.</p></div>"|7338.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7338-didnt-it-rain/|8.4|Christopher Dare

    don't talk often. It goes something like, ""People listen to other people who don't
    talk often,"" or something to that effect, but with far more pith. Whatever the
    pithy saying is, however, I'm certain it applies with great vigor to music.
    Pitchfork spews like Old Faithful on just about every sub-genre on earth, and, as
    evidenced by our vitriolic reader mail section, you take ample liberty to pronounce
    us full of living shit. There is one genre, however, on which you remain notably
    silent.  This genre is hip-hop.</p><p>
    
    Although your silence could be attributed to soul-free apathy, it appears from the
    empirical data that it's something else entirely: an unquestioning, irrational
    trust of Pitchfork hip-hop recommendations, and a validation of that great, classic
    saying (whatever that saying in fact is). You see, we don't often write about
    hip-hop, but when we do, you respond by opening your wallets. I offer as proof
    two examples, both released in 2001: Cannibal Ox's <i>The Cold Vein</i>, and Aesop
    Rock's <i>Labor Days</i>. If you didn't buy them, you know you went out of your
    way to hear them. And none of you had the balls to say an ill word. Like lemmings,
    you follow.</p><p>
    
    While you may be our lemmings (and full disclosure, we were far from the first
    publication to go off about those records), we are undoubtedly Def Jux's bitch.
    Aesop Rock and Cannibal Ox, both pillars of the label, could tell you that.  Our
    fidelity aside, though, Def Jux really is doing one hell of a job.  It's rare that
    you get one joint as good as <i>The Cold Vein</i> or <i>Labor Days</i> in any
    given year. To have two, and both on the same label, is something close to a minor
    miracle. So it's on the heels of this success that Def Jux understandably desires
    to garner some exposure for the rest of their cast. Their latest compilation,
    <i>Definitive Jux Presents II</i>, puts several new faces in the spotlight with
    above average results, stopping a few steps short of greatness.</p><p>
    
    If Def Jux could be defined by any single musical element, it would be the beats.
    The beats on <i>DJP2</i> are dark, jagged, and intriguing, and not a single one
    of them could in any way be deemed ""danceable."" Subway beats, sewer beats-- these
    ones reek of the underground.  The best beat comes early, on the album's first
    track, ""Same as It Never Was,"" by the Weathermen (featuring El-P, Vast Aire, Cage
    and mHz, among others). Employing an ordinary breakbeat, the song's verses are
    fueled by a repetitive three-chord key progression that sounds like a cross
    between an accordion and a Fender Rhodes. The chorus choppily and spastically
    misquotes the Talking Heads over a springy, oscillating sci-fi sample. All
    together, it's got an snarling off-kilter funk. Real nice.</p><p>
    
    Aesop shows up with a ""grimace"" and a solid set of rhymes on ""Dead Pan,"" declaring
    in the chorus, ""No, I'm not feeling all right."" Imagine Aesop in a fussy, bad mood,
    and you've got a handle on this track (""Drink a bad glass of gumption/ Not bad
    meaning 'bad' but bad meaning 'disgusting'""). ""Hold the Floor"" features a rough,
    head-nodding beat and a solid battle from mHz (""Now goin' against me and thinking
    you ain't gonna die/ Is like skinny dippin' in hell, thinking you ain't gonna
    fry""). Producer RJD2 does enough on the instrumental ""I Really Like Your Def Jux
    Tee Baby"" to live up to the rep he gained with the heralded 2001 12-inch, ""June.""
    His beat on the comp visits the same emotions as the rest on <i>DJP2</i>, but with
    a little less grit, and a little more grace (like strings samples).</p><p>
    
    Again, Pitchfork has spoken. This time, though, we've been let loose from our Def
    Jux leash. <i>DJP2</i> is quite good, but not great-- if you're a big hip-hop fan,
    you'll want this. And as an intro to the depths of the label, it ain't half bad.
    But if you're close to filling your three-hip-hop-albums-per-year quota, I'd save
    your money for another Def Jux artist debut, and another Pitchfork orgasm.</p></div>"|1872.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1872-definitive-jux-presents-ii/|7.8|Brad Haywood

I really do.  But no matter how hard
    I try, I just can't.  Don't get me wrong; they've got some great songs.  But they
    never quite hit me the way I want them to. It took some serious effort for me to
    even like them as much as I do.  Why would I possibly put forth so much effort to
    like a random band, you ask?  No reason.  I'm just funny that way.  But seriously,
    I heard <i>Strung Out in Heaven</i> for the first time back in '98 or so, and
    thought, ""Wow, that's disappointing.""  See, you can't just put the word ""massacre""
    after your name and not expect people to have some lofty expectations.</p><p>
    
    For whatever reason, I found myself drawn back to the disc a few months later and
    was still less than impressed.  It really wasn't until I'd kinda forgotten about
    them, and rediscovered them last year, that I finally admitted that <i>Strung Out
    in Heaven</i> was a good record.  So when I picked up <i>Bravery, Repetition, and
    Noise</i>, I figured it was now (then) or never.  This was their last chance to
    either impress me, or convince me to give up.  And what do those assholes do?
    They go and make a record that's so righteously mediocre that I'm back where I
    started.  Talk about a kick in the teeth!  Shit!</p><p>
    
    To the band's credit, the album starts off pretty good.  In fact, the upbeat yet
    somber second track, ""Telegram,"" is one of the best songs I've heard from them.
    But rest of the album never even comes close reaching that level, though not for
    lack of trying.  ""Sailor"" is a great psychedelic song with layered vocal harmonies
    and fuzz guitar that sounds reminiscent of <i>Head</i>-era Monkees.  ""Open Heart
    Surgery"" juxtaposes a simple haunting guitar lead in the foreground with a droning
    organ in the back to great success.  And, I might add, the vocals really remind me
    of Robert Smith, and therefore, the whole thing recalls late-80s Cure (think
    <i>Disintegration</i>).  And, since I've reviewed this thing all out of order so
    far, let me just say that the first song, ""Just for Today"" is really good, too.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the rest falls flat.  Individually, the songs aren't bad, but the
    album as a whole is awfully forgettable.  It all just kinda runs together and
    becomes background music-- rock that's accidentally ambient.  One of the low
    points comes with ""Let Me Stand Next to Your Flower,"" which features not only a
    stupid title, but also an intro consisting of stringed instruments, odd random
    voices, and the sound of someone logging onto the Internet (that's so 1997, guys).
    Can you say ""Revolution 9""?  Yeah, I thought you could.  And it's only downhill
    from there.</p><p>
    
    Were this album simply a six-song EP, consisting of the first six tracks, it could
    be really great.  Of course, that's not how it went down, and as an album,
    <i>Bravery, Repetition and Noise</i> just doesn't cut it.  The weird thing is
    that one of the songs is even on here twice.  They could've left off the ""If I
    Love You (New European Gold Standard Secret Babylonian Brotherhood Cinema Mix),""
    trimmed the fat a little, and had a damn fine release.  Instead, we get ""If I
    Love You (New European Gold Standard Secret Babylonian Brotherhood Cinema Mix)""
    in all its obnoxious unglory, weighting the record down with its unspeakable
    pointlessness.</p><p>
    
    And what's with that Eurotrash accent?  Who does Anton Newcombe think he is?
    Madonna?  I mean, fuck!</p></div>"|927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/927-bravery-repetition-and-noise/|5.8|Cory Byrom

    of sugarplum zeuhl demons dancing in his head.  It's worse for him than you might
    think: while most of us were engrossed in real stereophonic performances of <i>Fun
    House</i> or <i>Radio City</i>, Yoshida must have been burning to play on the same
    stage, or in some way act on his own theatric instincts, to create rock music that
    would defy the tradition laid out by a million critics worshipping Chuck Berry and
    the Stones. And then came punk. But not long after The Year Punk Broke, all the
    drama you whiled away in became uncool and pretentious.  So you and Yoshida had a
    stalemate, right?  How do you reconcile rock attitude, punk apathy and prog, well...
    strangeness?</p><p>
    
    Enter Ruins, a drums-n-bass duo who played harder than most and screamed better
    than anyone you knew.  And not least importantly, they had their Magma riffs down.
    This was not prog, mind you, and it certainly wasn't punk (imagine Paul Simonon
    trying to play ""Graviyaunosch""-- yikes!), but it has more indie cred than both
    put together. I mean, what's more alternative than playing a five-string bass
    while yodeling in a made-up language (one actually based on <i>another</i> made-up
    language) and recording your ""commercial"" album with Steve Albini? I'll just come
    out and say it: this is not for everyone. But Yoshida has gotten around this pesky
    gap between the genres by compartmentalizing his music. He has projects that deal
    exclusively with group improvisation, some that deal with noise, a couple of
    really good all-instrumental punk-prog bands, and Koenji-Hyakkei. Koenji is a
    unique concept for Yoshida, and it may go down as his greatest achievement: the
    most perfect fusion of straight prog, the avant-garde and hardcore punk. Amen.</p><p>
    
    This is Koenji's third album, and for the record, it's even more overtly proggy
    than the first two. Former vocalist Aki Kubota left the band, and for any of you
    who thought she was irreplaceable, you're only half right: Oguchi Kenichi easily
    fulfills her old role as keyboardist, and much of the music seems to have been
    written to suit his strengths; and new vocalist Samara Name certainly has the
    vocal chops to pull off more than her fair share of theatrics. The biggest losses
    here are Kubota's compositions, which were always among the band's most colorful,
    particularly given Yoshida's propensity to dominate the proceedings with the
    vocalist/writer/drummer trisect. She will be missed, but even if the direction
    has changed slightly, the enthusiasm has not.</p><p>
    
    On <i>NIVRAYM</i>, there's a newfound emphasis on keyboard textures, and a whole
    new bag of solo breaks. The other Koenji albums stood out from the pack for any
    number of reasons, but particularly in their lack of flashy improv.  Here, Kenichi
    gets in his licks and then some, similar to Ruins' <i>Symphonica</i> (unusual for
    the group, with added singers and keyboards), on which he impractically stole the
    show. In fact, much of this album reminds of <i>Symphonica</i>, also due to a
    slightly lighter sound than its predecessors. It's no cakewalk, but it's not quite
    the overloaded powder keg of 1997's <i>II</i>, either. This suits the synths, as
    well as the vocal lines, which are ever closer to that hallowed qualifier of lore
    known as ""almost normal.""</p><p>
    
    But normal is relative, of course, and here, it refers mostly to Magma's zeuhl
    heritage, and the occasional dramatic soprano lead.  Instrumentally, the band
    plays fairly close to hard-edged Rock In Opposition sound. There's a lot of
    traditional avant-prog to this music, with very complex instrumental counterpoint
    and a kind of playful attitude to experimentation, but the abrasive elements bring
    it closer to the post-modern of old new-schoolers like John Zorn and Mr. Bungle.
    Overall, <i>NIVRAYM</i> is more refined, and none the cornier for it.</p><p>
    
    One of the great things about this record (and this kind of stuff in general) is
    that it seems such a glorious reaction to the great records of the past, rather
    than indebted to them.  Put simply: <i>NIVRAYM</i> is one of the better records I
    heard in 2001. It's fun, challenging, and you'll learn a lot. No, wait, that's
    school. Try this: it's fun, challenging, and will kick your ass all the way back
    to Wednesday. Yeah, that sounds right.</p></div>"|4504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4504-nivraym/|8.4|Dominique Leone

These days, when just about anyone can buy some
    recording equipment and make a halfway decent sounding album, a lot of bands seem
    to think they can get away with doing everything themselves.  Some of them are
    right, of course, and a lot of self-produced bands churn out some amazing work.
    But most of these bands are, frankly, kidding themselves.</p><p>
    
    Case in point: the Waking Eyes, who at some point decided it would for the best
    if they produced their own debut record, <i>Combing the Clouds</i>.  Perhaps it
    was merely a practical matter-- producers can be expensive, of course-- or perhaps
    they had other motives, but whatever the reason, it's clear from listening to the
    album that the band could stand an outside voice informing their creative projects.</p><p>
    
    Featuring past members of the Pets and Novillero, the Waking Eyes aren't exactly
    dewy-eyed newcomers, and it shows in the songwriting.  The band writes solid
    melodies, backed by imaginative progressions and arrangement ideas.  The primary
    problems lie in its execution.  Sonically speaking, <i>Combing the Clouds</i> is a
    48-minute stroll through a musical used car lot full of sounds bought back wholesale
    from the 70s and very late 60s.</p><p>
    
    The band piles on affectations and vintage-sounding instruments to the point where
    it becomes hard to see the songs for the clever compositions they are.  This is
    where a producer could come in very handy-- someone a little less attached to the
    music could easily point out the fat in these songs and convince the band that
    some trimming is needed to make it more digestible.  A set of outside ears (at the
    very least, an experienced engineer) could also have done wonders for this record
    simply by making the mix more vibrant.  Frequently, the album simply sounds dull
    in the places where it's vital that it hook you.</p><p>
    
    Take the two ballads nestled at tracks four and five: ""Castle by the Bay"" and
    ""Gone with a Glance.""  ""Castle by the Bay"" features a nice horn arrangement, a
    good melody and some fine group vocals, but virtually no sense of discretion in
    placing all of those elements together.  The bass and keyboards bleed together
    and the horns play in the background as though someone turned on a radio during
    the recording session.  The vocals are recorded in such a way that they manage to
    fade into the music as though they were just another element in a sonic wallpaper
    pattern.</p><p>
    
    ""Gone with a Glance"" suffers similar problems at first, beginning as a simple
    piano ballad before adding a rhythm section and a terrible synthesized string
    patch.  The second verse finds the vocals struggling to be heard above a wandering,
    wholly unnecessary clarinet part.  After the leaden second chorus, the song
    suddenly mutates into a poorly realized Queen tribute, complete with heavily
    overdubbed vocals and Brian May-style harmonized guitar leads.  The dramatic
    effect that Queen managed to achieve with that sound, however, is lost completely
    in the muddled mix-- the guitar quickly sinks below everything else, and the
    ""choir"" never comes to the fore at all.</p><p>
    
    Other songs show promise, but get lost in their affectations, like the psychedelic
    ""New Rising Sun,"" a Cream-y ball of fuzz packed with organ that could be called
    Doorsy, though a more accurate comparison might be Smash Mouth.  The breakdown is
    a somewhat interesting section dominated by percussion and tape effects, but even
    that's pretty muddy sounding.  ""The World It's Alive"" has some nice, easy-going
    rhythms and a neat tejano horn section, but the great tune is lost in a clutter
    of noise and hyperactive keyboards.</p><p>
    
    ""Tergo Velum"" is actually a great song, with a yearning melody and some fine
    backing harmonies, but once again, the band doesn't seem to know when to stop
    adding things to the mix.  What could be a striking acoustic song is drowned in
    inconsequential little squiggles and unnecessary violin and clarinet noodling.
    ""Make a Sound"" follows with yet another fine melody, this time delivered a bit
    more effectively.  Unfortunately, the horn arrangement is lost under the rest of
    the instruments, but the various sections of the song segue rather nicely together.
    There's even one of those moments that makes you look around the room for the
    source of a sound, as a watch alarm goes off right at the end of the second
    chorus.  It's a fun little addition that just might send you to the back button
    to make sure that it was actually on the record and not somewhere in your house.</p><p>
    
    A few other songs work reasonably well, such as the opener ""Combs for the Clouds,""
    with its fine harmonies, elastic bassline and relatively uncluttered production.
    ""Anytime"" is similarly modest in its trappings and delivers the album's strongest
    hook to boot.  Granted, even this song suffers from some unfocused moments, such
    as the short passage before the third verse, but by and large, it's a decent song
    that allows its melody to shine appropriately.</p><p>
    
    Also surprisingly successful is ""Sunday Morning Blues,"" fully delivering on its
    title.  The band transitions from lo-fi acoustic blues straight into a healthy
    electric shuffle featuring some impressive, dirty guitar leads.  The organ is
    obviously not a real Hammond, instead emitting a rather weak tone that unfortunately
    makes the arrangement sound bit thin, but the band makes up for it with a good
    feel and some astounding lead guitar work.  A rocking midsection and an oddball
    circus music interlude don't contribute much to the song, but they don't detract
    much from it, either.  And on this album, that's basically all you can ask for.</p><p>
    
    But ""Sunday Morning Blues"" also illustrates some of the most frustrating things
    about the Waking Eyes.  Obviously, they're very talented musicians, and fine
    songwriters as well.  They rotate vocals and instruments with aplomb, rarely
    failing to deliver a competent performance.  However, their tendency to get
    carried away during recording is ultimately too much for their considerable skills
    to handle, and the album fails to make much of an impact.  To bring things full
    circle, a little bit of outside input might be all this band needs to work their
    way up into the 8.0 realm.  Here's hoping they get it on future efforts.</p></div>"|8566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8566-combing-the-clouds/|5.6|Joe Tangari

In that dream, there are no names for music. Music just is. You
    heard me. No country. No rock. No rap, polka, classical or experimental. And
    certainly, in this dream, there is no such thing as ""electronic music.""  See, one
    thing I've never really understood is contemporary electronic music's apparent
    need to separate itself from the rest of the world's music. The insistence of
    putting the word ""electronic"" in front of the word ""music"" draws a line that
    needn't exist, frightening away potential listeners and setting in motion certain
    unnecessary presumptions.  Distinctions as simple as ""electronic music"" assume a
    music that's simple, too. And while ""simple"" is hardly a term that fits much of
    today's music, far too often electronic music is.</p><p>
    Half a century ago things were different. Visionaries like Luciano Berio and Edgar
    Varese saw electronics as part of the greater picture. Littering their avant-garde
    compositions with sounds both natural and computer-borne, they juxtaposed the
    natural and the synthetic, along the way posing the question as to just how far
    removed these sounds even were from one another.</p><p>
    But since the popularization of electronic music in the early 1990s, it's often
    seemed like we've taken a step back. More often than not, music is categorized as
    either electronic or otherwise. There would seem to be no in between. This tendency
    to segregate two perfectly compatible styles of music continues to baffle me. And
    apparently, I'm not alone. As evidenced by Radiohead's recent steps toward the
    abstract, Mouse on Mars' electro-acoustic grooves, and recent works by Cex, the
    Shalabi Effect and Múm, all of which have made use of both electronics and ""real""
    instruments, the general populace is growing more comfortable with the idea of
    blurring this line.</p><p>
    It's this willingness to cross needless genre lines that saves David Edwards' solo
    electronic project, Minotaur Shock, from the void of IDM anonymity.  <i>Chiff-Chaffs
    and Willow Warblers</i> opens ordinarily enough: morphing beats, chopped up sounds,
    smooth synth textures; your average student of the Morr Music School for Pretty
    IDM. Is it nice-sounding?  Yup.  Well produced?  Uh-huh.  Enjoyable?  Sure.
    Memorable?  Well... let's put it this way: turn it on in a room full of people;
    no one's liable to complain, though it seems unlikely anyone will give it a second
    thought. But watch those heads turn the very moment a simply strummed acoustic
    guitar is dropped into the mix on the third track, ""First to Back Down.""  Marvel
    at the way a sampled trumpet brings the beats grinding to a halt and breathes new
    life into ""Moray Arrival."" The addition of glockenspiel, recorder, vibraphone,
    and a slew of other acoustic instruments lifts this release from the pits of
    mediocrity.</p><p>
    Granted, there are solid electronically produced moments, too. ""The Range"" infuses
    typical Chicago-style post-rock with minimal glitch-house loops, deconstructing a
    McCombs-ian bassline held over from the prior track, dicing it, bouncing the results
    from speaker to speaker in time with the music while synthesized vibraphone and
    melodica flavors the track.  On ""Out of the Hot,"" a gentle synth backdrop makes
    for great contrast with the garbled beats and piercing Atari melodies.</p><p>
    Still, the best moments here are those that infuse the mechanical with the organic.
    Like the reprisal of the aforementioned Atari melody later in the album, voiced
    this time instead by a bunch of string instruments. Or ""Local Violin Shop,"" which
    opens with a basic repeated Rhodes keyboard figure before adding an acoustic guitar
    and static beeping, followed by live, non-processed drums. It proceeds for about a
    minute as an acoustic rock number, before you realize that you're no longer hearing
    guitar, but rather guitar loops. Soon, all natural sound but the drums have dropped
    out, only to be replaced by an explosion of digitally processed keyboard and guitar.
    Sounds get layered upon one another. It becomes impossible to tell what's processed
    and what's not. There's an escalation, a climax, and a return to the simple acoustic
    instruments with which the track began. It's an amazing song from start to finish.</p><p>
<i>Chiff-Chaffs and Willow Warblers</i> has its fair share of such moments, but not
    quite enough to put it in the same class as similar artists like Múm or ISAN.  Of
    course, if this sort of gentle-beat-driven thing is your bag, it's unlikely you'll
    find much to argue with here. Edwards would do well to stick to his guns and add
    even more acoustic toys to the mix on future attempts. Without a doubt, his liberal
    use of such instrumentation is refreshing, not to mention a step in the direction
    of an emancipated musical utopia where no one is bound by restrictive genre-names
    and where sounds interact any which way they damned well please.</p></div>"|5314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5314-chiff-chaffs-and-willow-warblers/|7.4|David M. Pecoraro

    powerful men.  Who could forget the historic 1972 meeting of Richard Nixon and
    Chairman Mao in Beijing?  Or the tense Cold War rendezvous between JFK and Nikolai
    Khruschchev back in '61?  Even recently, we've seen George Bush I spraying his
    lunch all over the Japanese Prime Minister, and Vladimir Putin chopping wood with
    G-Dubs at the ""Western White House.""</p><p>
    Well guess what, indie rockers?  Now we have our very own version of a presidential
    summit, an album-length collaboration from prolific boozehound Robert Pollard and
    the formerly hyper-enough Mac McCaughan.  Okay, so maybe the analogy is a little
    ridiculous, as Pollard and McCaughan aren't brokering any arms treaties between
    Dayton and Chapel Hill on <i>Calling Zero</i>.  But the project does reflect one
    key feature of most political summits, in that there's a whole lot of pomp and
    circumstance, but not much in the way of substantial results.</p><p>
<i>Calling Zero</i> is the nineteenth album in Pollard's ""Fading Captain"" series,
    King Shit's wildly inconsistent quest to build up a solo catalog of Merzbox-like
    scope.  And like many recent releases from the series, the album utilizes Pollard's
    favorite trick of late: soliciting instrumental tracks from friends and overdubbing
    liberal amounts of his trademark arena-rock-in-a-can vocals.  Here, for the first
    time, he goes outside the very extended Guided by Voices family to choose Superchunk
    frontman McCaughan as a collaborator.</p><p>
    It sounds like the wet dream of a mid-90s college radio DJ, but unfortunately,
    <i>Go Back Snowball</i>'s total does not add up to the sum of its individual parts.
    If, like me, you prayed that McCaughan would steer Pollard out of the increasingly
    clichéd slump he's been in since the heyday of the Classic Dayton Lineup, well,
    keep on prayin'.  McCaughan's poppish ways and newfound restraint would seem to
    fill the gap that Tobin Sprout's departure has left in recent GBV work, but like
    the similar-concept Airport 5 albums with Sprout, the songs here sound largely
    half-baked and awkwardly constructed.</p><p>
    For this failure, I blame the device.  It's hard to fault McCaughan, who,
    responsible for all the instrumentation on <i>Calling Zero</i>, submits a number
    of interesting musical ideas in the lighter vein of the last two Superchunk albums.
    Prominently using old keyboards and budget electronics, a number of tracks (""Climb,""
    ""Throat of Throats"") have a distinctly Stephen Merritt-esque sound, while ""Radical
    Girl"" and ""Dumbluck Systems Storefront"" smartly incorporate brass sections.</p><p>
    But these airy constructions sound tailored to the fragile, high voice of McCaughan,
    not the cock-rock swagger of Pollard.  Try to imagine Uncle Bob singing <i>Here's
    to Shutting Up</i>'s ""Late-Century Dream"" and you'll get the idea.  Even when
    McCaughan cranks up the old distortion pedal on ""Lifetime for the Mavericks,"" the
    high-flying vocals sound strangely out of place.</p><p>
    ""Mavericks"" also supplies an excellent example of the other problem plaguing
    <i>Calling Zero</i>: the excessively thin and demo-like sound.  In many cases,
    the songs would be improved greatly by the strident drumming of Superchunk's Jon
    Wurster, or the bass-playing of, well, anybody, since there's hardly any low-end
    to be found.  A more lo-fi approach might've covered up these omissions as well,
    with the tape hiss of old GBV warming up the sparse decor, but the overly slick
    sound only highlights the shortcomings.</p><p>
    As such, <i>Calling Zero</i> is far too entrenched in the middle, not playing
    enough to Pollard's opposing strengths of microphone-swinging rock or four-track
    experimentalism.  The bright spots (""I Am Divine,"" the title track) suggest a
    certain amount of chemistry between the quasi-famous duo, but the slapdash feel
    of the rest make one wonder if a face-to-face interaction would've been more
    rewarding than this collaboration-by-mail.  I'm sorry to report we'll all have to
    continuing waiting for indie-rock's answer to the powerful Jay-Z/R. Kelly alliance.
    The best of both worlds, baby.</p></div>"|3474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3474-calling-zero/|4.3|Rob Mitchum

    There are loads and loads of reasons this can happen, but when it comes to indie
    music, it's usually because they aren't trying. And so, like a basement-dwelling
    stoner's gainfully employed girlfriend, you sit around loving them deeply, not
    wanting to criticize but knowing they could Do Great Things if they'd only give
    it an honest shot.</p><p>
    Sometimes I think I feel that way about Vitesse. Here's the deal: they released
    two gorgeous records before this one. Both revolve around serious mining of
    early-to-mid-80s British rainy-day indie and synth-pop-- New Order, Electronic,
    early Depeche Mode, OMD-- which is to say that they consist of moody pop songs
    constructed from sweepy/bleepy synth programming, shimmery guitar arpeggios, and
    dour, bittersweet crooning. They also fall pretty squarely into the whole
    bedroom-indie aesthetic, meaning that these records sound, well, bedroomy--
    intimate, a little lo-fi, and a little bit rigged with duct tape. I'll discuss
    Stephin Merritt momentarily.  The first Vitesse record was called <em>A Certain
    Hostility</em>, and it was great: all twinkly synths and sleepy melodies and an
    absolute swooner of a track called ""A Fine Young Age""; most of it fell closer to
    <em>Holiday</em>-era Magnetic Fields than those common-ancestor Brits. The second
    record was called <em>Chelsea 27099</em>, and not only was it great, but it signified
    a slight attitude shift: same rainy days, but suddenly the synths were colder and
    buzzier, the drum machines more booming, suspicious squints all over the vocals.</p><p>
    I-- and, full disclosure, the ""I"" here is shamelessly devoted to moody early-80s
    Brit indie, the ""I"" <em>lives</em> for it-- couldn't wait for Vitesse to blossom.
    There's nothing <em>massively</em> interesting about hearing synthy stuff
    bedroom-style. It's charming as hell for a couple records, but here's the thing:
    I <em>believe</em> in Vitesse. They sound fabulous, and sometimes their songwriting
    is as spot-on as I could possibly ask for. So I wanted to hear these synth
    symphonies writ <em>large</em>-- I wanted to see them chuck the comfy sweaters and
    bedheads and get all slicked up and flashy in beautiful suits. I wanted to hear
    them top My Favorite's ""Homeless Club Kids"" (incredibly stiff competition in this
    milieu), or put a pop challenge to the hi-fi electro grcooves of Felix da Housecat
    and Adult. I wanted <em>ambition</em>. Which is why <em>What Can Not Be, But Is...</em>
    is slightly painful to me. It's lovely, really, as adorable as either of the last
    two records. Maybe less, depending-- the songs here seem a tad weaker than before--
    but close, anyway. It skims and pulses along on hi-hats and synth pads and Peter
    Hook riffs and wispy vocals as sweetly and melodically as anything else they've
    done, which you can probably tell is sort of my problem.</p><p>
    Need I mention the guilt involved in being dissatisfied with something I enjoy so
    much? But there you have it: this record contains eight Vitesse-penned tracks that,
    if I didn't like them, I would likely call ""re-hashed,"" plus two covers (OMD's ""2nd
    Thought"" and Bruce Springsteen's ""Unsatisfied Heart""), the first of which pleases
    with its immaculate New Order-isms and the latter of which slots surprisingly well
    into the Stephin Merritt-ish sound they're sliding back toward. The rest swoons
    pleasantly enough.</p><p>
    They're probably content this way, unambitiously sending out solid bedroom
    communiqués every year or two. Probably they have other things they're busy with:
    Josh Klein writes for <i>The Onion</i>, and I imagine Hewson Chen has something
    stimulating to do-- growing up in America listening to posh British synth-indie
    used to be a pretty surefire way to wind up reading lots of books, and University
    of Chicago grads do okay in the job market. Klein's never really dug into a band,
    anyway: he played drums on the first Toulouse record-- which was similarly great
    enough that you wished they'd taken on more-- and did a similar bow-out from Aden,
    about whom ditto. <em>A Certain Hostility</em> was supposedly recorded in 36 hours,
    and it doesn't sound as if they've started clearing <em>second</em> weekends for
    their projects. Exactly how fortunate are we that David Grubbs is the only
    University of Chicago guy who thinks big? Must I really be the high school English
    teacher who explains that she only grades them down because she can see that they
    have more potential than that?</p><p>
    Strip away my fretting, though: a simpler way of saying all of this is that if you
    like the Magnetic Fields' <em>Holiday</em> (or the 6ths' <em>Wasp's Nest</em>, or even
    Orange Cake Mix, while we're at it), you should buy some Vitesse records immediately.
    Hopefully, you'll never face the day when you realize you're going to stop caring
    about new ones if they're not going to show some commitment. A different simple
    way of saying this is just to quote Hewson Chen, from ""Starlight"": ""Sometimes
    you've just got to try a little harder.""</p></div>"|8479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8479-what-cannot-be-but-is/|6.8|Nitsuh Abebe

    Performing live and then editing the tracks in a Teo Macero-like manner, Eardrum
    hope to preserve the spontaneity of live performance, and to shape their jams
    into something far greater than the sum of its individual parts.  But despite
    their noble intentions, Eardrum only partially succeed. <i>Side Effects</i> is
    an enormous canvas upon which Eardrum and a legion of guest percussionists have
    painted fragments of rhythm. The risk that Eardrum run is that the album could
    be too thickly layered to make any headway through.  And indeed, the band's
    gamble never fully pays off.</p><p>
<i>Side Effects</i> is not mere smog; it's hardening concrete.  A shame, because
    Cicotelli and Baker and their guests-- Jason Yarde (of J Life, Yoruba Jazz
    People and Manu Dibango), Folasade Barbarinde (of Adzido Pan African Dance and
    Drum Ensemble), Gary Jeff (of Mass, God, and Scalpel), Nii Tagoe (of Adzido,
    Frititi, and African Head Charge), Nana Tsiboe (of Dade Krama, Moire Drum
    Orchestra, and Trouble Dat) and Laika's Guy Fixsen-- are really quite competent
    as musicians.  It's just that the music is impenetrable.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps my concern about <i>Side Effects</i> is due to my limited exposure to
    avant-garde percussion albums.  Sure, I've enjoyed Evelyn Glennie's
    conservatoire-junglist album <i>Shadow Behind the Iron Sun</i> and done a
    lifetime's worth of Watusis to Toby Dammit's <i>Top Dollar</i>.  But Eardrum's
    Miles-on-Mars remix of Sofa Surfers' ""Guns 'n' Bombs 'n' Knives"" still bugs me
    out whenever I hear it.  So I concede that I may be at fault.  Nonetheless, let
    me outline my misgivings.</p><p>
    
    The biggest problem I see with <i>Side Effects</i> is that the individual tracks
    have little for me to latch onto, with the exception of a few select tracks.
    ""Sandblasted,"" with its sax squalls and insistent bass rhythms, sounds as though
    Eardrum have captured the Master Musicians of Jajouka and promised their release,
    provided the guys make a monstrous enough racket. ""Two Strangers,"" accompanied
    by Imade Iyamu's chants, allows Guy Fixsen's Moog to squiggle and farp.
    ""Trickster Tale"" sends Sun Ra's Arkestra on an echoed-out journey beyond the
    orbit of Neptune.  The relentless bass boom and cowbell-ish tones of ""Bone Room""
    could serve as the basis for a mega-ton Techno Animal doom rap track. The
    gloriously sullied ""Escape from Evil"" traps Chic's wikky-wikky guitar sound and
    uses it as a birch to whip the devoid-of-funk.</p><p>
    
    However, too many tracks-- such as ""Family Mask,"" the album opener-- remain
    impenetrable, as their percussive resilience balks at comprehension. I've even
    tried to listen to ""Family Mask"" as wallpaper, but to little success. I really
    want to engage with the apocalyptic voodoo madness within, but maybe I'm just not
    skilled or pure enough to be granted entry. I doubt very much that Eardrum are
    expecting huge sales for <i>Side Effects</i>.  Although some occasionally
    eclectic DJs might want a copy as an exotic tool to break up their sets with,
    <i>Side Effects</i>' uncompromising murkiness is likely to prevent all but the
    most devoted from enjoying it.</p></div>"|2644.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2644-side-effects/|7.0|Paul Cooper

Granted, her work generally sees
    favorable reviews, but I've seen a lot of offhand comments from IDM kids who
    dismiss her because she used to work as press secretary for Warp.  It's clear even
    from her small discography as DJ and composer that Chantal Passamonte isn't trying
    to be the female Aphex Twin, regardless of how many have made that comparison.
    Richard James, Mike Paradinas &amp; Co. camp out in what Rephlex has come to call the
    ""braindance"" tradition-- their brand of cerebral mindfuckery.  Passamonte's 2000
    release <i>One on One</i> expressed an almost obsessive attention to sonic
    contiguity, the result being a hypersensual world of sound that flowed in its own
    mysterious patterns.  Her use of soft, whispered vocals also added a level of
    intimacy not often found with the lads mentioned above.</p><p>
<i>Prickle</i> followed as an EP in May of 2001.  If the review is a bit late,
    please forgive; I've been lost in the 19-minute opening track.  It's never given
    the name ""Prickle,"" but rather is subdivided into four suites.  The first,
    ""Miliaria,"" is named appropriately, in that ""mili-"" and ""-ia"" both suggest
    unquantifiable vastness.  Static flutters out of your headphones and other
    phenomena mill about in the periphery.  A sense of scale develops as a dense hiss
    rises above like a synthetic stormcloud.  Brief, melancholy piano phrases give
    form to the mix, followed by thumping beats that remind of Posthuman's debut.
    Passamonte's wispy singing tempers the cold swells of the keyboard, echoing
    beautifully.</p><p>
    
    After roughly eight minutes that movement fades, and the human touch is subsumed
    into alien environs populated by glitchy chirps and analogue squirts.  Right around
    this point I lose what little footing I had.  Thudding percussion reverberates
    under avian quibbling, threatening to turn my walk home into a safari.  I'm saved
    by biomechanical crackling, an oblique machine-rhythm of some sort that brings me
    back from the veldt.  The album sleeve features childlike sketches of flora and
    fauna set amongst an expansive plain.  Together with the music, it's a fitting
    evocation of Mira Calix' South African homeland by way of London's sound.  If you
    can't be at home, might as well take a little world with you.</p><p>
    
    The second and final track is a remix of <i>One on One</i>'s ""Skin with Me,""
    courtesy of Andrea Parker.  As might be imagined, it's got an electro vibe,
    framed by that light tchak hit on the fourth beat and fleshed out by anthemic
    synth vamps.  Parker loops a fragment of Passamonte's voice for the main melodic
    line, very similar in result to Moby's retooling of the Smashing Pumpkins' ""1979,""
    in which he isolated that wibbling ""tweeee"" effect and slowed it to an unsettling
    speed, building up his own song around the sample.  It's the kind of piece that's
    danceable but difficult to imagine on a dancefloor; you'd have more luck with it
    as a choreograph routine for that diva from <i>The Fifth Element</i>.  The remix
    works as a nice coda for Passamonte's opus-in-microcosm.</p></div>"|1246.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1246-prickle-ep/|7.8|Christopher Dare

    The 13th Floor Elevators' first album, Love's <i>Forever Changes</i>, Pink Floyd's
    <i>Piper at the Gates of Dawn</i>, and other such mind-expanding classics can get
    the job done on their own. They don't need much outside help in the form of drugs,
    or anything else for that matter. The way I see it, if an album needs drugs to
    make it enjoyable or emotionally moving, then-- by definition-- it's lacking
    something. I don't think I'm being prudish when I say, at its best, psychedelic
    music should be a more-than-adequate substitute for drugs. If psychedelic music
    is simply music to take drugs to, then the latest Creed album is the most
    psychedelic album ever: it makes me want to take drugs-- all of them, as quickly
    as possible.</p><p>
    
    While nowhere near as accomplished as the above mentioned albums (and not really
    sounding much like them, either), this second LP from a Northern Californian
    tree-sitting, psychedelic ewok-cum-John-Fahey-disciple named Ben Chasny and
    his (essentially) one man acoustic drone/raga outfit Six Organs of Admittance
    certainly needs no lysergic crutch, despite its outward trappings which might
    suggest otherwise.</p><p>
<i>Dark Noontide</i> is basically a tribal-psych album with acoustic guitar serving
    as the campfire around which flutes, recorders, tablas, bells, chimes, and sundry
    other instruments dance. It's not a playful, frolicking dance; it has a somber and
    contemplative tone, almost funereal at times.  Three out of the eight songs also
    feature Chasny's singing, which is somewhat hard to pin down. Sometimes it sounds
    like a less operatic Tim Buckley (maybe hard to imagine), a gravel-voiced Roger
    McGuinn, or maybe Skip Spence.  Still, it's nicely distinctive and perfectly
    matched to the musical accompaniment.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with the solemn blues of ""Spirits Abandoned,"" with Chasny singing
    the refrain, ""I know what you've done/ What you've become,"" with an almost zen-like
    detachment, as if the subject of the song is just too overwhelming to be dealt
    with head-on. ""This Hand"" mixes pseudo-religious lyrics with the best use of a
    buzzing guitar string since Neil Young's ""Ambulance Blues,"" while the album ends
    with a comparatively rockish tune called ""A Thousand Birds."" Propelled by a
    driving acoustic guitar riff, the song explodes into a distorted, spastic
    electric guitar freakout, ending the album in unexpected fashion, given the
    loose, meditative feel of what preceded it.</p><p>
    
    Between these more ""song-oriented"" pieces, there are a couple of short solo
    acoustic numbers that many Fahey fans would appreciate, along with some other
    noise/drone improv pieces similar to the ones Tower Recordings have dedicated
    themselves to releasing.  On their own, these tracks aren't anything spectacular.
    But as part of <i>Dark Noontide</i>'s expansive whole, they have the ability to
    transport you to another world like few modern-day psychedelic recordings can.
    A kaleidoscopic, hallucinatory experience, all without the aid of drugs. Put that
    in your pipe and smoke it.</p></div>"|7199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7199-dark-noontide/|8.2|Jason Nickey

    in one of the rooms, alone with a guitar. Sure, there's a revolving fanbase whose
    ranks are refreshed by the ever-circulating mass of people listening in hushed awe,
    but the only constant is the guitar player... and his is the loneliest of lives.
    His music is considered a ""buzzkill,"" as it generally reflects his disillusionment
    with the politics of the social world and will temporarily permeate the euphoric
    ambience of any who dare enter the room for a song.  Somewhere along the way, David
    Bazan made the decision that life outside that room just wasn't worth the toll it
    took on the soul. Now he permanently resides there, subtly sermonizing to any
    who'll listen.</p><p>
    
    Throughout the course of Pedro the Lion's career, Bazan has kept his arrangements
    relatively sparse, and <i>The Only Reason I Feel Secure</i> certainly didn't make
    any attempt to break from that tradition upon its initial Made in Mexico release.
    The EP, comprised of five songs dealing with ""criticism"" of all things, first
    introduced Bazan's self-defeating love for conceptualist departure which would be
    fully realized on his 30-minute opus <i>Winners Never Quit</i>. Now that the band
    has jumped ship from Made in Mexico, their back catalog is getting the Jade Tree
    treatment, complete with repackaging and, in the case of <i>The Only Reason I Feel
    Secure</i>, the inclusion of a few bonus tracks.  Though the EP's re-release
    certainly won't galvanize the industry, it remains the definitive litmus test for
    those unfamiliar with Pedro's Eitzel-esque song structures and valium-induced
    contemplations on life.</p><p>
    
    Much fuss is unnecessarily made of Bazan's Christian leanings. Luckily, Pedro the
    Lion have always been reasonable, lyrically speaking.  Rather than openly addressing
    the Christian God, they opt to lament through ambiguity which occasionally yields
    some awkwardly worded sentiments. Still, there's something disarming, even from an
    objectivist's standpoint, about the disparity and wide-eyed inquiry in lyrics like,
    ""I hear that you don't change/ How do you expect to keep up with the trends/ You
    won't survive the information age."" This, coupled with the somber arrangement of
    ""Letter from a Concerned Follower,"" makes for one of the disc's better moments.
    If not for former labelmate Damien Jurado's similarly charred pipes and thematic
    offerings, Pedro the Lion could easily escape on the potency of their lyrics.
    However, it seems that everything Bazan tries to accomplish on <i>The Only Reason</i>
    has already been done before, albeit better. So if you consider yourself a fan of
    the Lion, do yourself a favor and go pick up Jurado's <i>Rehearsals for Departure</i>.
    Oh, and pretty much anything by American Music Club.</p><p>
    
    Ex-Pitchforker Zach Hooker gave <i>The Only Reason I Feel Secure</i> a slightly
    overwhelming 8.4 upon its initial release.  Purism be damned, but there's something
    that just doesn't bode well about an EP that boasts a whopping total of three new
    tracks (one being a live interpretation of ""Invention,"" a song found earlier on
    the record), a lyrics sheet, and an inflated price.  The slightly abridged <i>The
    Only Reason</i> is still widely available and isn't nearly as much of a strain on
    your pocketbook.  Both make for the perfect accompaniment to that 4:00am
    disillusionment that has occasionally claimed us all. Unfortunately, such moments
    are few and far between, and Bazan's output just doesn't sport the same underlying
    complexity as contemporaries Red House Painters, Will Oldham, and other such artists
    whose music is often denoted by meditations in the same mood.</p><p>
    
    Pedro the Lion hail from Nathaniel Hawthorne's America. This is what wayward
    Puritans would headbang to.  Satan has invariably given us greater musical gifts,
    but for those introverts facing more exalted theological issues, <i>The Only Reason
    I Feel Secure</i> fits like a tailored rosary. Of course, life back then was stark
    and simple, and the Lion make no qualms about the utter incomplexity of their work.
    Though it cuts down on extraneous and unnecessary accompaniment, it also makes for
    a complete lack of surprise when Bazan unsheathes the old verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge
    formula song after song. It's funny, though, that emo, a genre obviously begat by
    Beelzebub himself, finds so many of its contributions inspired by the word of God.</p></div>"|6212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6212-the-only-reason-i-feel-secure-ep/|7.5|Kevin Adickes

The Saxons rock the house!  And when the Saxons rock the
    house, they rock it all the way down!"" --Langley High School Cheerleading Team</i></p><p>
    
    Not only were the Langley Saxon cheerleaders hot and slutty, but they were also
    unwitting soothsayers-- who ever could have predicted that Saxons of the future
    would so thoroughly rock the house?  But in the early 1990s, they did.  As grunge
    exploded nationwide, Langley's Auxiliary Gym played host to a different sort of
    musical explosion: the limitless pyrotechnic excitement of the Battle of the Bands.
    At Langley, however, each event seemed much less a ""battle"" than a small episode
    in a never-ending ""War of the Bands,"" as fierce ""Skirmishes of the Bands"" seemed
    to break out almost every weekend, usually on the same hotly contested turf, and
    for the same rich $50.00 bounty.</p><p>
    
    Among the regulars in Langley's War of the Bands were stalwart cover artists Spook
    Jacobs, whose flawless version of Van Halen's ""Jump"" was the weekly neutron bomb
    that obliterated all other contestants, including, appropriately enough, Ground
    Zero, featuring the powerful, androgynous tenor of ""Handsome"" Dan Sheridan.
    There were also the King Fahds, with their indie flair, underdog attitude, and
    mediocre songwriting ability. In true indie fashion, the King Fahds never won
    shit. Spook Jacobs, on the other hand, won both shit <i>and</i> fame, piling up
    victories well into the mid-to-late 90s. One would have thought that, at the
    minimum, Spook would be staring at a sweet recording deal by now.  But alas,
    they had to settle for merely regional conquest.</p><p>
    
    Of those not shamed into radioactive dust by the Spooks' atomic force were two
    graduates of Langley's class of 1991, Tim Bracy and Pete Hoffman (who undoubtedly
    remember all three bands), and a part-time contributor to their band, and likewise
    Langley alum, Paul Deppler. As far as I know, none of them ever enlisted in the
    War. So much the better. Instead, Bracy and Hoffman created their own musical
    insurgency, an indie pop outfit known as the Mendoza Line.</p><p>
    
    Now on their fourth LP, the Mendoza Line has gained a reputation for rootsy,
    melody-driven pop/rock.  That reputation certainly won't change with <i>Lost in
    Revelry</i>, but as long as they're being formulaic, they're doing a fine job.
    The majority of the album's highlights come courtesy of the songwriting tandem
    of Bracy and Hoffman, whose maturity as songsmiths is notable-- this record is
    consistently concise, punchy and poignant.</p><p>
    
    The album's superb populist clap-along opener, ""A Damn Good Disguise,"" stands out
    as the best song on the disc, and is emblematic of the Mendoza Line's sound; two
    parts Westerberg, one part Wilco. The band shifts into a lower gear for ""The Triple
    Bill of Shame,"" a raspy, rustic tune that delivers a heap of emotion and a load
    of nifty rhymes (""And you were once of interest/ To the nightly news and the daily
    press/ But now that you've outlived your uselessness/ Do you know what doesn't
    happen next?/ They all call you by your number, they won't call you by your name/
    On the triple bill of shame"").</p><p>
    
    Mendoza compadre Shannon Mary McArdle doesn't fare quite as well. McArdle, who
    first appeared on 1999's <i>I Like You When You're Not Around</i>, plays a more
    prominent role on <i>Lost in Revelry</i>, writing five songs for the album, and
    singing lead vocals on each of them. Great as a backup vocalist, McArdle could
    use a little help with the guitar and pen. A few of her songs are decent (""Red
    Metal Doors""), but others, like the quasi-country of ""Something Dark,"" and the
    snore-along ""I'm That!"" (the exclamation point is pure irony) beg for the skip
    button.</p><p>
    
    Long has the War laid dormant, but the Mendoza Line has renewed their assault,
    hoping that one day, ultimate triumph will forge an era of peace between the
    bands. Unfortunately, this assault, while effective, leaves them without complete
    victory. The house, while rocked, still stands.</p></div>"|5225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5225-lost-in-revelry/|7.5|Brad Haywood

Who knew?  It's been out of
    print for years, but now that it's back, it's being called everything from ""a
    good set of drinking songs"" to ""the seed that sprouted alt-country"" to ""the
    greatest rock album in history.""  <i>Fear and Whiskey</i> was the first great
    statement of ""shambolic punk"" band the Mekons, and yes, it is as great as all
    their rabid fans have always said (though ""the greatest rock album in history""
    is, of course, a bit of a stretch).</p><p>
    
    As I was digging through my rock library to figure out what defines a classic, I
    found an essay by Steve Wynn of the Dream Syndicate, listing his top criteria for
    what makes a great rock album.  The most important factor, he argued, was ""the
    potential of falling apart at any moment"": not just that the recording sounds
    rough around the edges, but that the entire band could have careened off the
    rails at any time.  The Mekons, circa 1985, fit that description wonderfully.
    Though this album took months of planning, <i>Fear and Whiskey</i> sounds as
    chaotic and spontaneous as any great night at a dance hall full of the reek of
    stale beer.  Just like a live show, almost all you can hear through the record's
    tinny sound are Steve Goulding's drums-- pounding out a dance beat crossed with a
    military tattoo-- and Susie Honeyman's fiddle, soaring above, pretty but ragged.
    Singer/guitarists Tom Greenhalgh and Jon Langford bellow, cheer and grumble
    through the noise.  They sing about booze, they sing about politics, and most of
    all, they sing about despair: Greenhalgh opens ""Chivalry"" with, ""I was out late
    the other night/ Fear and whiskey kept me going,"" while the heroic tune from the
    violin keeps him upright.</p><p>
    
    But let's move past the drinking and look at what it stands for: failure and
    camaraderie.  The Mekons were born in '77 but were all but defunct by the mid-80s;
    they reunited to play benefit shows for miners during the strike of '84-85.  As
    ""non-aligned lefties,"" the band raged against the Thatcher administration, and
    watched the suffering of miners who were on strike for a year and then went back
    to work in defeat.  But against that backdrop, <i>Fear and Whiskey</i> doesn't so
    much as stumble.  Every disaster turns into a victory anthem, from Greenhalgh and
    Langford shouting through ""Hard to Be Human Again,"" to ""Abernant 1984/85,"" which
    is a glorious waltz no matter how bleak the lyrics (""They seek to destroy us/ How
    much more is there left to lose?"").</p><p>
    
    The music is a mess of influences united on the bones of punk music.  The Mekons
    always subscribed to the ""anything goes"" rules of Britain's ""Class of '77,"" and
    <i>Fear and Whiskey</i> is their most famous example: this was the record where
    they started to assimilate country music.  It was a radical move in mid-80s Britain,
    not least because of the right-wing politics that were associated with the style.
    Musicologists have labelled this the father of alt-country, that bastard offspring
    of indie rock and country/western-- though for as much as you hear it on ""Darkness
    and Doubt"" (complete with a John Wayne reference), or the cover of Hank Williams'
    hit ""Lost Highway,"" country is just one of the styles jammed in here, along with
    English folk, Leeds punk, and whatever else was at hand.  Anyone who expects
    scenic Americana will stop short at the second song, ""Trouble Down South,"" a weird
    mini-drama that would bring a lesser album to its knees: Ken Lite narrates some
    kind of a military advance over a reggae-inflected drum machine and a wheezing
    accordion, while soprano Jaqui Callis struggles to hit her highest notes.  As far
    as it fits here at all, it's to force the listener to accept that the Mekons are
    ready and willing to do whatever they want.</p><p>
    
    No matter how scattershot the first few songs sound, the second half of the album
    justifies everything.  With a ""proper"" band assembled, these last five songs were
    ""recorded and mixed one fine spring day in 1985,"" and they make up one of the most
    spontaneous, exciting and perfect album sides ever.  For fourteen minutes, from
    ""Flitcraft"" to ""Lost Highway,"" the Mekons don't touch the ground.  This is music
    that is effortlessly, spontaneously great, with a massive beat that sweeps along
    grim lyrics like, ""We know that for many years there's been no country here.""</p><p>
    
    But it's right near the end that they play the crowning song, the most perfect
    part of the album: ""Last Dance,"" a pop song that sounds like it had never been
    played before that day but where every note falls in place, down to that throwaway
    guitar solo and Honeyman's beautiful fiddle, so bright it could make you want to
    cry.  The narrator sings about the end of the night, when the music's winding down
    and it's time to search the room for someone to take home.  The lyrics are resigned
    to failure, but then there are two lines in the middle-- ""So beautiful, you were
    waltzing/ Little frozen rivers all covered in snow""-- sung by a man whose desire
    stretches his capacity for eloquence: he could have just seen the woman he'll marry.
    And he probably goes home alone.</p><p>
    
    The Mekons didn't stand on the brink of collapse because they chose to; they
    accepted the knowledge that everything could be ripped from their hands.  The
    Thatcher administration could declare war on the people; the miners could lose

    rowdy old songs.</p></div>"|5208.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5208-fear-and-whiskey/|9.7|Chris Dahlen

    construct a lengthy laundry list of superficial complaints-- the band name (ugh),
    the typeface (awful), the cover art (goofy, maudlin photography), the photos of
    androgynous pink-haired teenagers in the liner notes (make it stop), the song
    titles (for the love of god, ""Your Beauty, The Sunrise?!""), and the profound
    sense of foreboding the preceding qualities ensured.</p><p>
    
    Superficial issues aside:</p><p>
    
    Slackjaw's <i>Darkest Hour</i> may be the best example of a 5.0 record I've ever
    heard. Its physical attributes are more or less average-- nine songs in 46 minutes,
    most of which average around the five-minute mark (excepting one short song and
    one long song). The sound falls squarely between nouveau emo and Radiohead-inspired
    album rock. The musicians are competent, the songwriting is occasionally inspired
    and occasionally abysmal, but largely pleasant, pedestrian, and innocuous. The
    lyrics mostly rhyme, contain a requisite amount of postmodern malaise, and sometimes
    employ pretty poetic affectation. Most of the songs seem to be about failing
    relationships and the sort of existential angst associated with mornings after and
    drinking alone.</p><p>
    
    And you could say: ""Well, you could say the same thing about a lot of bands--
    almost <i>every</i> band, in fact.""  Which would prove my point.  That, right
    there, is the heart of the 5.0.  Average.  And there's nothing inherently wrong
    with average. It's a glass half-full or half-empty scenario.</p><p>
    
    For the case of half-full: ""The First Thing to Go,"" the album's opener, is lush
    and cinematic, building on a pleasant sort of white-noised soundscape. Singer Eric
    Schopmeyer's hushed vocal technique provides a nice complement to the music itself.
    It evokes the right sort of pretty, yet sad tone that dominates the rest of the
    album. For a threesome, Slackjaw has a relatively full sound, assisted in part by
    a wide variety of instrumentation. And I'll give them this: it's hard to integrate
    chimes without sounding ridiculous. They pull it off well.</p><p>
    
    Another bonus: songs flow almost seamlessly into one another.  This works particularly
    well with the first two tracks: ""The First Thing to Go"" and ""Unscathed,"" the latter
    switching gears so dramatically halfway through that I thought they'd fucked up
    the tracklist. (Actually, the jury is still out on whether this is clever or just
    irritating).  The instrumentation makes a huge difference, too.  On ""White Noise,""
    jazz piano plays counterpoint to dissonant bursts of guitar.  It's a cunning trick
    of composition which represents what these guys do exceptionally well.  Suffice to
    say, these guys have a lot of potential.</p><p>
    
    On the half-empty tip: certain moments on <i>Darkest Hour</i> (most notably the
    overblown ""One Too Many Mornings"") are indeed atmospheric, but in that
    breakup-scene-in-a-teen-movie sort of way. They sound very typical, and can bear
    a marked resemblance to the emotive rock hits featured on the commercial
    alternative stations-- those ones by the bands whose names you never remember--
    which is aided by singer Eric Schopmeyer's theatrical vocal style.  His tenor
    moans recall college-rock crooners and second-rate Jeff Buckley impersonators,
    and the breathy, whispered filler is distractingly artificial.  This combination
    evokes the inevitable world-weary tone favored by four out of five sensitive
    teenagers with black-framed glasses. It would be something special if it hadn't
    been done before.  But it has.  And it isn't.</p><p>
    
    Significant orchestral arrangements can occasionally bolster an otherwise
    simplistic sound, but I'm not entirely sure Slackjaw is ready for a grand opus.
    The inclusion of unusual instrumentation can also smack of self-importance, and
    middling songwriter skills. Part of me that wishes someone hadn't complied with
    the probable studio command to ""make it bigger.""  There are very few artists in
    the world that can pull off full-tilt album rock pretension. For all I know,
    Slackjaw may arise as saviors of rock and roll-- after all, stranger things
    have happened-- but <i>Darkest Hour</i> isn't going to get them there.</p><p>
    
    And one further note: wearing your influences on your sleeve only works if you
    deviate from the formula. With the possible exception of ""White Noise,"" every
    song on here sounds like a tribute to another band. From Radiohead on ""The First
    Thing to Go"" to American Analog Set on ""All That Remains"" (dead ringer).  That
    Slackjaw perform with some agility is of secondary concern, because ultimately
    it's sort of boring.</p></div>"|7232.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7232-darkest-hour/|5.0|Alison Fields

    None of you readers are actually sitting there thinking, ""Hmm, I wonder if that
    new Bad Religion album is worth buying.  I'll see what Pitchfork says about it.""
    Of course not.  You're all like a bunch of sharks circling around a freshly thrown
    bucket of chum.  You want to see blood.  You want to see gore.  You want to see
    your friendly neighborhood elitist thoroughly skewering a band long past its prime.</p><p>
    
    Well, tough.  I'm not gonna give it you.  And I do this not out of any moral or
    ethical standard, but rather because I am a Writer of Fine Literature disguised as
    humble little record reviews, and resorting to such a predictable course is beneath
    me.</p><p>
    
    Sure, <i>The Process of Belief</i> serves up enough Slo-Pitch softballs for me to
    spend a thousand words hitting wiseacre home runs.  This is, after all, a band of
    fortysomethings playing music more appropriate to kids struggling with puberty and
    Algebra.  It's an album where the first entity thanked in the liner notes is ""all
    punks everywhere.""  It's an album with a song called ""Kyoto Now!"" which actually,
    honest to god, contains a ""Turning Japanese"" Oriental-style riff and the lyric,
    ""You might not think there's any wisdom in a fucked up punk rock song.""</p><p>
    
    But you know, I find it strangely reassuring that Bad Religion sounds exactly the
    same as when I last heard them, sometime around 1994's <i>Stranger Than Fiction</i>.
    Now, this <i>could</i> be because <i>The Process of Belief</i> marks the return of
    guitarist ""Mr."" Brett Gurewitz from behind his executive's desk at Epitaph, but I
    kinda don't think so.  Like death and taxes, one thing you can count on in this
    world is that most Bad Religion songs are going to use a combination of rapid-fire
    power chords, snare and bass-heavy drums, 25¢-word machine gun vocals, and
    those creepy synthetic-sounding harmonies.</p><p>
    
    Honestly, if you can turn off your frontal lobe and forget that you've heard songs
    like this forty or fifty times before from Bad Religion, there's a few piping hot
    tracks to be found in <i>The Process of Belief</i>.  On occasion, Gurewitz and
    singer Greg Graffin continue to show strong hook-writing ability, as with the
    front-loaded old-school drag racers ""Supersonic"" and ""Can't Stop It.""  And if
    you slowed down ""Evangeline"" to half-speed, the result would be the best Weezer
    song of the last six years.</p><p>
    
    Furthermore, nothing makes a case for Bad Religion sticking to their thematic guns
    like the sporadic (and rather hilarious) attempts to stretch their sound.  The
    reggae-punk of ""Sorrow,"" for example, hasn't been considered adventurous since
    around the time of my birth late in the Carter administration.  Obvious pleas for
    radio play, like the mid-tempo and acoustic-flavored ""Broken,"" make you feel a
    little sorry for the band and their memories of brief mid-nineties alt-rock
    stardom (sing it: ""You and me-ee/ Have a disea-ease!"")</p><p>
    
    Most of the album, however, is indistinguishable from anything post-<i>No Control</i>,
    and sounds like it could've been released any time in the last twelve years of the
    band's history.  The question would be, then, is the Bad Religion formula still
    relevant?  I'm going to take a shocking stance here and say, ""Yup.""  Hear me out.</p><p>
    
    Back when I was concerned about such things, I used to have a theory that punk
    rock split, at some undetermined point, into two camps: goofy punk about girls
    and food (i.e. the Descendents) and political punk about socialism and governmental
    corruption (i.e. Bad Religion).  Over the past few years, it's become apparent
    that the goofy punks won, with the Green Day/Blink-182/Sum 41 lineage remaining
    the only commercially viable branch on the punk rock family tree.  Political punk,
    as far as I know, has all but disappeared (is Propagandhi still around?), leaving
    only its great grandpappy to carry the torch for educating our nation's youth
    about petrochemical conspiracies.</p><p>
    
    Therefore, I think discovering Bad Religion and their Chomsky for Dummies rhetoric
    is an important experience for a youth in his/her formative musical years.  Sure,
    their politics are a little flimsy and idealistic (the line ""when all soldiers lay
    their weapons down"" would make even a 1967 Haight-Ashbury drum circle queasy), but
    Graffin's lyrics at least can plant questions in a seventh grader's brain more
    profound than whether that girl in study hall likes him.  And it's all delivered
    in the kind of sugar-high sonic package that speaks most directly to the age range
    in question.</p><p>
    
    So buy a copy of <i>The Process of Belief</i> for your little brother, or niece,
    or Boy Scout Troop.  Chances are, they'll probably enjoy it a lot more than Fennesz,
    and you'll be setting them on a path towards heightened musical and political
    awareness.  Bad Religion, I salute you.</p></div>"|520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/520-the-process-of-belief/|5.1|Rob Mitchum

    crazy old professor locked up in a lab, communicating with a machine the size of
    a house, churning out something illogical and strange which no one but the most
    die-hard of avant-gardists would ever hear. But this was not always the case. Take
    Raymond Scott, for example, a maverick mind who made music with computers in the
    1950s-60s. Whether or not you know his name, you've heard his music. His short
    compositions served as the score for everything from Twinkies commercials to
    Marvin the Martian cartoons. Such was the fate of most early electronic artists.
    Though their names may never be known by anyone but the most obsessive music
    nerds, their work will live on, both in its random appearances in popular culture
    and in the effect it had on artists of today.</p><p>
    Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Scott and others like him toiled away in relative
    obscurity, making short pieces, the rights to which would often later be purchased
    by television producers. Recent years have seen enterprising record labels filing
    through the vaults of this so-called Library Music. Recent compilations like Motel
    Records' <i>Cinemaphonic Soul Punch</i> series, Strut UK's <i>Music for Dancefloors:
    The Cream of the Chapell Music Library Sessions</i>, and <i>Manhattan Research</i>--
    Basta Records' compilation of recently unearthed recordings by Scott-- showcased
    an amazing array of music, all far-ahead of its time, and most of it steeped in
    anonymity. Half the fun of this music, of course, lies with that air of familiarity.
    Even if you've never heard the particular song before, it has a feel that's similar
    to the music you've been hearing all your life without ever knowing it.</p><p>
<i>Nuggets: Luke Vibert's Selection</i> is Lo Recordings' stab at the Library
    Music compilation market. Comprised largely from works by French musicians Nino
    Nardini, Roger Roger and Eddie Warner (who are also billed as Peter Bonello,
    Cecil Leuter and Georges Teperino, respectively), <i>Nuggets</i> is a collection
    of short psychedelic tunes pulling equally from the realms of funk, rock and jazz,
    with heavy doses of synths and delays. And to help you justify dropping your
    well-earned dollars, the fine folks at Lo even included Vibert's name on the
    package.</p><p>
    But it's actually more than a marketing ploy. Vibert's actually a pretty logical
    choice as curator. This is the sort of stuff he's been sampling in his work for
    years. Apparently, Juicy Luke himself spent a few weeks digging through a series
    of archives to compile this disc, most of which has never seen release to the
    general public. Much like Vibert's recordings as Wagon Christ, the music on
    <i>Nuggets</i> tends to walk that fine line between funky/danceable and
    too-goofy-for-its-own-good.  And also like his music, there are moments which
    suffer from mediocrity, but those moments where everything meshes are strong
    enough to make up for it.</p><p>
    Luckily, these tracks are short and well-sequenced enough to make up for any dull
    moments. Look at the way Epstein and Kraman's utterly silly ""Turkish Delight""
    (which consists of a escalating keyboard pattern, scatting vocals manipulated to
    sound like a child and complimentary synth horns and vibes) comes after the
    straightforward funk of Richard Demaria's ""Next Episode"" (which seems pulled right
    out of a Coldcut Solid Steel mix).</p><p>
    Or the way Georges Teperino's forward moving 70s-action-show-theme-song-esque
    ""Cleopatra"" follows the lazy day introspection of Nardini's 33-second ""Soft Bossa""
    (which, with softly strummed guitars, warm strings and a lush female vocal, sounds
    exactly like its name implies) and the repetitive synthlines and drum machine that
    make up Boneschi Electronic Combo's somewhat boring ""The Bungler.""</p><p>
    Or the way short tracks like Bonello's ""Electronic Track 10,"" David Holland's
    ""Zouche Drums 3"" (both of which were made with percussion only) and Nardini's
    cheesy ""Bumbling Along"" break up longer numbers like the Johanna Group's excellent
    ""Strange Love Action,"" a song that's equal parts acoustic guitar noodling,
    pseudo-Musique Concrète-style electronic sounds, avant-garde strings, and 70s
    rock cliché medley. Or Jack Arel/Pierre Dutour's ""Sundown,"" which contrasts the
    sparseness of strings and handdrums with the fullness of synth-generated horn,
    piano and drum fanfares.</p><p>
    The best tracks here meld the experimental electronics with decidedly accessible
    pop music, making the new and foreign approachable. Eddie Warner's ""Telex""
    incorporates the beeping of a telegram with a slow-but-pleasant pop structure.
    Built around a simple drum machine pattern, Roger Roger's ""Frantique"" begins and
    ends with a deep but simple keyboard melody that trades parts with heavily
    distorted cymbals. But somewhere in the middle, a frantic (eh? eh?) guitar part
    breaks in, followed by ambient electronic noodling that circles around the
    effected cymbals for a minute or so before bringing us back to earth.</p><p>
    Other tracks try the same trick with less success. ""Pots and Pans,"" by A. King/J.
    Matthews, seems like a Musique Concrète piece thrown on top of a funk song, with
    no thought given to where the two parts match. Call it an exercise in Cageian
    chance music, if you wish.  Me, I call it clunky and difficult.</p><p>
    Still, most of these tracks are worthwhile, if at times a bit silly. But it's a
    safe bet that anyone drawn to this disc by Vibert's name won't mind a little
    kookiness, just as it's a safe bet you've never heard any of these tracks before.
    Even if, at times, it sounds like you have.</p></div>"|8461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8461-nuggets-luke-viberts-selection/|7.6|David M. Pecoraro

    maiden voyage under the Galerie Stratique guise. Beullac describes his work as
    misty-abstract electronica, which sets up loathsome images of an airbrushed future
    as envisioned by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. But no matter what brickbats Beullac
    throws, you should head straight for the album-- it's the most refreshing pure-IDM
    album I've heard since Ulrich Schnauss' <i>Far Away Trains Passing By</i> was
    released late last year.  <i>Nothing Down-to-Earth</i> is so complete an album
    that I can't possibly condone Law and Auder even thinking about commissioning a
    remix record.</p><p>
    Beullac distinguishes himself by being concise and true to himself. He's
    self-assured enough not to leap on any bandwagon or to pay more than passing lip
    service to current software and styles.  <i>Nothing Down-to-Earth</i> is therefore
    starkly bereft of post-Autechre laptop crunch and Schematic glitch. Beullac's beats
    are not entities removed from the drifting spaciness of his ambience; he's
    integrated them into the texture of his pieces, and thereby released them from
    just signifying rhythmic units. This approach to beat-programming reminds me of
    the time of Autechre's <i>Tri Repetae</i>. <i>Nothing Down-to-Earth</i> additionally
    derives its ambivalent complex-simple style from Global Communications' <i>76.14</i>
    and Reload's <i>A Collection of Short Stories</i>. As a result, anyone expecting
    Beullac to be a bleeding-edge member of the Montreal electronic scene will find
    this album wistfully nostalgic. By the same token, if you're up for some almost
    forgotten Artificial Intelligence and Headphone listening, <i>Nothing Down-to-Earth</i>
    delivers in spades.</p><p>
    With the opener, ""Star Filter,"" Beullac begins as he means to go on.  The song is
    a delicately echoed drift through dust motes.  ""Algeria"" follows, mutating the
    first track's theme with a middle-eastern inflected variant.  As the track builds
    tension, repeating the melody line and adding incrementally more oppressive
    percussion, Beullac releases a powerful analog bass drone to maintain order.
    Still, an alien countermelody soon appears and challenges all other elements for
    dominance.</p><p>
    ""Leviathan"" is the first piece that borrows from the processed Burundi-style
    drumming that Jon Hassell and Brian Eno used for their seminal and visionary
    <i>Possible Music</i>. Beullac gives his polyrhythms prominence and uses dark
    ambient tones to infuse ""Leviathan"" with a looming, monstrous quality that
    justifies its title.  ""Frozen Lakes"" reprises the echoing chimes of ""Star Filter,""
    but as it's three times as long, Beullac has the opportunity to add a nomadic
    melodica line. I find ""Frozen Lakes"" an inappropriate title, because the music is
    far more fluid than I'd expect from a piece with this name.  It's the melodica
    line that connotes for me distance and yearning, and within the context of this
    piece, my third eye imagines wandering through the heatless vastness of space. Or
    perhaps I've been listening to too many Augustus Pablo records to appreciate any
    other situation for a melodica.</p><p>
    Inevitably, <i>Nothing Down-to-Earth</i> cannot escape the influence of the Boards
    of Canada.  Though ""Rylka"" borrows its naïve melody from <i>Music Has the Right to
    Children</i>, Beullac distinguishes the track by adding some Burundi-by-way-of-<i>Possible
    Music</i> percussion. ""Luna"" begins as a reworking of Albinoni's ""Adagio"" for Orb
    devotees, but Beullac breaks out his melodica for another mournful trip across the
    universe.</p><p>
    ""Opale"" is bass-heavy master class in getting away with gauzy,
    pitch-slipping hooks just as the fuzzed-out cathedral organ of ""Soleil Levant""
    demonstrates what the Phantom of the Opera would play if he'd been studying Brian
    Wilson and Aphex Twin. The phantasmagoric and elegant four minutes of ""Soleil
    Levante"" are what Simian spent their entire debut album trying to create. The
    sound picture that Beullac paints here is not the trite image of sun rising that
    the Beatles did with ""Here Comes the Sun."" Beullac's sun is unmistakably more
    Gnostic, more order of the Golden Dawn than George Harrison's happy-go-lucky
    vision. Perpetuating Beullac's shrouded, disquieting style, ""Dictaphone"" is a
    Namlook-like sequencer piece, disrupted by static bursts and garbled speech.
    Again, my third eye is overstimulated. Beullac's ""Dictaphone"" is like the
    forties-futurist office supplies in Alex Proyas' <i>Dark City</i>.</p><p>
<i>Nothing Down-to-Earth</i> is as complete a debut as I've heard in ages. Unless
    you're looking for innovation, there's nothing here that won't amaze you. Yes,
    you've heard some of these textures before, and yes, Beullac borrows from
    predecessors. But I never lost Beullac in this album. His uniqueness is the
    background radiation of the universe of <i>Nothing Down-to-Earth</i>. Too many
    debuts submerge individuality in order to emulate (and therefore become part of)
    canonical IDM releases. Though Beullac's debut may not receive the plaudits it
    manifestly deserves because of its unwillingness to pay homage to Reaktor's latest
    upgrade or the mandates of the style council of the IDM listserv, I am over the
    moon with it.</p></div>"|3383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3383-nothing-down-to-earth/|8.7|Paul Cooper

    he'd read the email right.  Barcelona were breaking up?  What a bummer.  Not only
    were they one of the main bands on the pulCec imprint, they'd basically written
    Darla's website.  Nobody else had a sound quite like theirs-- some people had
    taken to calling it ""programmer pop,"" what with the keyboard melodies and all the
    references to computers and software and stuff.  Of course, they had taken to
    writing some stock songs like ""Teenage Pop Star"" lately.  The keyboard intro
    soared like any classic new wave cut, and the boy-girl harmony was cute, but what
    was with the chorus?  ""Gonna be a teenage one-hit washed-up messed-up megalomaniac""--
    yet the song sounded like it could be a Saturday morning cartoon intro!  Anyway,
    they would be missed.</p><p>
    Jeff couldn't believe the news about Barcelona.  He didn't like much synth-pop, but
    the jangling guitars gave these guys a rocking sound.  They didn't use a drum
    machine, either-- it was all live.  Who else was going to write songs like ""I
    Have the Password to Your Shell Account""?!  When he saw that song title on Napster
    back in the day, he thought it was a joke.  And Jennifer Carr, whoa-- brains,
    beauty <i>and</i> a good voice.  She could take his server down any day.  It
    didn't make any sense, the new album was just as good as all the others.  ""West
    Coast Radio"" was like a Beach Boys song for the digital age, with Jason Korzen
    singing about some intimidating California girl and Carr cooing backing vocals.
    The album art was cool, too-- images of robots with serving trays Photoshopped
    into pictures of African natives.  It was something conceptual about primitives
    and futurists.  But he had to get back to work; the figures for the next round of
    missile tests needed to be in by five.</p><p>
    Trevor Kampmann had seen it coming.  All his engineering work couldn't do much
    for a song like ""The Power of Jen.""  The surf riff wasn't much different than the
    Cult's ""She Sells Sanctuary,"" and Jen Carr insisted on singing something twee
    about boys who kept calling her.  The chorus was total fluff: ""J-E-N-N-I-F-E-R.""
    Ugh.  They'd written some really great songs for the album, though.  ""Human
    Simulation"" bleeped along with its buzzy Casio keyboards, and Carr's soaring
    ""I'd give you anything that you want"" was irresistible.  They really should have
    put her in front of the mic more often.  Most of the songs featured Korzen on
    main vocals, and his delivery was just too forced.  Cameron Crowe was a fan, and
    he'd helped them to decide the final sequencing, but they couldn't seem to put
    together enough songs to last half an hour.  They may have perfected their style,
    but all the mid-tempo rhythms didn't make for much excitement, and the guitar
    tone tended to slip into monotony.</p><p>
    Sarah sat back from her iMac.  She'd just imagined a two-song suite.  It began
    with a minute-and-a-half-long instrumental, ""April 1978,"" which featured a gently
    rolling beat and a guitar pinging at the high registers sentimentally.  That would
    serve as an introduction to ""I Get the Message,"" another slow ballad that didn't
    descend into cliché.  Some lyrics even popped up in her head: ""Radio waves reflect
    across the screen/ Terminal haze, your transmission's beamed/ I feel the impact
    from the satellite that's calling me.""  Later on, maybe she'd have somebody going
    ""bah-dah, dah-dah"" over and over again, like a verbal expression of those lonely
    radio waves.  But then it occurred to her that maybe she was spending way too much
    time at rockstargame.com.  It was fun to watch her little automatons write the
    same songs over and over, and ""Everything Makes Me Think About Sex"" almost made
    it to hit single.  But it was clear that a indie rock band inspired by silly 80s
    groups like Sparks probably didn't have a chance to climb to the top, and it
    wasn't going to get her an 'A' in Logic.  Time to get back to work.</p><p>

Kind of, anyway.  If you'd just thrown this
    disc on and asked me where and when it was played, I would have guessed Manchester,
    England, 1992 without giving it much thought.  And I probably would have wondered
    how such a good little shoegazer record had managed to elude me as I swept the
    genre clean several years ago.  You see, big, swirly, noisy British rock was the
    music that finally broke my close-minded assumption that no one had made any good
    music after the 70s.  And once I found it, I dove in deep, scooping up all the
    Ride albums I could find and hunting down all of the elusive Boo Radleys records
    and EPs I could find.  If asked, I could produce a pretty massive stack of discs
    that fit at least vaguely in the category, from acknowledged classics like
    <i>Loveless</i> to obscurities like a 14 Iced Bears compilation.</p><p>
    
    Of course, Ides of Space's debut album wasn't recorded in 1992, nor in Manchester,
    England.  Rather, it's just an anachronism from Sydney, Australia.  And damned if
    I don't love it.  I suppose it's my lot to like an album like this, given the
    special place this kind of music has in my heart.  But while I love it, I have to
    face facts-- <i>There Are No New Clouds</i> breaks no new ground whatsoever and
    the ground it does tread is already beaten halfway to death.</p><p>
    
    ""This Side of the Screen"" opens the album with clean guitars and crisp drums that
    could have come straight off of Ride's <i>Nowhere</i>.  Patrick Haid intones in a
    heavily accented tenor and gets through most of a verse before the inevitable wall
    of distortion blasts in from both speakers and wraps everything in a dense fuzz.
    ""Arthur's Car"" follows with a much brisker rhythm and mostly clean guitars, opting
    instead to allow Martin Barker's keyboards to fill in the spaces that would
    normally be occupied by noise.  Haid's voice is doubled over the top, delivering
    a strong melody in a tone reminiscent of some of American indiedom's tweer elements,
    like Witch Hazel and Spectacle.</p><p>
    
    From there, the band blasts through eight other blissed-out nuggets, most of which
    would have been worthy of an <i>NME Single of the Week</i> column about a decade
    ago.  At this point, though, they're simply enjoyable, and I think the quality of
    the music says something for the band.  The way they play and write, it's hard to
    believe they've only been together for two years.  The melodies are well developed
    and the playing is technically flawless, yet rough enough to sound real.  The only
    consistently unpredictable timbre is Barker's keyboard, but the Ides vary the feels
    and tempos enough that the songs don't blur together.</p><p>
    
    ""Random Noise Generator"" ably displays the band's tightness and skill with its
    switch from a quiet, slow, spacy intro into a quick-paced rocker with an impressive
    instrumental breakdown in the middle.  The band builds toward a climax but instead
    stops short with a brief silence before blasting back into the verse.  The device
    is a little less effective when repeated for the outro, but they vary the approach
    slightly by filling the silence with a delay-drenched keyboard and cropping the
    buildup.</p><p>
    
    Guitarist Mark Ayoub serves up some appealing, if highly derivative, lead parts to
    counterbalance Haid's airy lead vocal on ""I Promise Not to Notice If You Promise
    to Pretend.""  The rhythm section of brothers Anthony and David The hits particularly
    hard on this song, too, laying down a solid, driving foundation for the other
    members' more skyward aspirations.</p><p>
    
    It's followed by ""Computer World,"" which, though unfortunately not a surprise
    Kraftwerk cover, offers a good look at the band's facility with slower, quieter
    songs.  Beginning with sparse guitar strumming and a distant keyboard drone that
    wouldn't sound terribly out of place on an old Talk Talk or recent Hood record,
    it evolves into a windswept ballad that makes good use of space between instruments
    and notes, only opting to fill it with loud distortion near the very end.</p><p>
    
    Part of what makes this album so successful is the guiding hand of producer Wayne
    Connolly, who sees to it that, no matter how loud or noisy it is, no one part
    overwhelms any of the others in a way that it shouldn't.  In addition to being
    well and confidently played, this album even sounds good.  This record isn't
    really for everybody, though-- if you're not already a convert to the shoegazer
    aesthetic, this won't be the disc that changes your mind.  But despite the fact
    that it doesn't really do anything that original, there's plenty of good stuff to
    be found here, and <i>There Are No New Clouds</i>, while an unintentionally
    accurate title, at the very least reveals a young band with scads of potential.
    If they came this far in two years, imagine where they'll be after two more.</p></div>"|4058.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4058-there-are-no-new-clouds/|6.7|Joe Tangari

    1955: ""Louie Louie"" is penned and originally performed by Richard Berry, songwriter
    and frontman for R&amp;B; outfit Richard Berry and the Dreamers.</p><p>
    
    1963: ""Louie Louie,"" as interpreted by Portland, Oregon garage-band the Kingsmen,
    causes a sensation, due in no small part to the unintelligible lyrical rendition
    by lead singer Jack Ely.  While on the road, bassist Norm Sundholm, appalled by
    the lack of volume available from his bass cabinet, contacts brother Conrad
    Sundholm to help him with a solution.</p><p>
    
    1964: While the state of Indiana bans the Kingsmens' hit ""Louie Louie"" from the
    radio, citing suspected obscenities in the aforementioned ""unintelligible
    lyrical rendition"" (a case which FBI head J. Edgar Hoover himself would take up
    and not drop until 1965), Conrad Sundholm creates the world's first high-powered
    concert bass amplifier.</p><p>
    
    1965: An increased interest in the amplifiers leads to increased orders from
    guitarists and bassists alike, prompting Conrad to move the operation out of his
    Father's garage.  The Sunn amplifier company is born.</p><p>
    
    1969: Sunn amplifiers are used for the famed monstrous sound system at the
    Woodstock Music and Arts Fair in upstate New York.</p><p>
    
    ""The SUNNO))) mission is to create trance like soundscapes with the ultimate low
    end/bottom frequencies intended to massage the listeners intestines into an act
    of defecation.""</p><p>
    
    Before forming this band in honor of Earth, the powerful drone/doom outfit who
    somehow released four albums on Sub Pop while maintaining a higher doom:drone
    ration than any other band from the Northwest, Steve O'Malley and Greg Anderson
    did time in Burning Witch and Goatsnake, respectively.  But SUNNO))) is a
    different beast entirely, a dual homage to the two things that count: bravado
    and volume.</p><p>
<i>Flight of the Behemoth</i> is fifty minutes of well-calculated doomdrone that,
    in one swift take, manages to sound slower than Sleep, more hypnotic than Sabbath,
    and ten times more powerful than any early 60s NYC drone music (John Cale, Tony
    Conrad, etc.), and for one simple reason: it's based on metal.</p><p>
    
    The opening track, ""Death Becomes You,"" does not fade in.  It kicks the fucking
    door open and does not stop riffing every so slightly until the end of its
    thirteen minutes when it crackles out with the sound of a chorus of crackling,
    speakerkilling malfunctions.  ""Mocking Solemnity"" follows, employing similar
    tactics, save for some extra feedback and a bit more high-end.</p><p>
    
    ""SunnO)))BOW 1"" and ""SunnO)))BOW 2"" are extremely well-fortified remixes of
    SUNN O))) tracks by Masami Akita, who you might know better by his alias, Merzbow.
    Merzbow steps in on top of these tracks, and, his match met the by low-end
    sludgemasters present in the mix, decides to liven the tracks up with some
    plunking piano in the left channel, accompanied by signature high-end noise
    bursts in the right.  The second remix ends in a terrifying swirl of noise and
    bass which comes pretty close to the SUNNO))) mission referenced above.  Needless
    to say, the addition of Merzbow to these tracks is very welcome.</p><p>
    
    The final track, entitled ""FWTBT: (I dream of Lars Ulrich being thrown the bus
    window instead of my master Mystikall Kliff Burton),"" starts out with what
    sounds like a detuned 808 kickdrum hit, before it melts savagely into a furious
    and panting repetition of the previous track's nicely executed M.O.  Add some
    faint drumming and some overtly breathy ""singing"" and you have what sounds like
    a Sabbath song with all the tricks focused in one place, stretched out over ten
    minutes, without the imagery necessary to propel you straight downward.</p><p>
    
    When I first heard Sleep's ""Jerusalem,"" I thought that the ultimate in slowness
    and deliberation had been reached, that it would not be possible to transcend the
    completely stoned realm of Nazareth that the hour-long concept album champions.
    Obviously, I wasn't looking hard enough.</p><p>
    
    This album sounds like it could have been recorded ten miles away from Woodstock
    while it was happening, with special microphones buried ten miles below the surface
    of the earth to only catch the vibrations of the bass on stage and the pounding of
    all those hippies doing whatever the hell it was they were doing.  The trajectory
    that begins with Richard Berry and ends with Merzbow leaves me wondering what J.
    Edgar Hoover would have thought of this album.  And then I remember that he was a
    crossdresser.</p></div>"|7578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7578-flight-of-the-behemoth/|8.5|Mike Bernstein

It's now well-established
    that the records they make together are great, but just as interesting is how much
    they bring to projects outside the band. Each member's instrumental style is both
    unique and extremely portable. Jim White and Mick Turner work together beautifully
    as a freelance rhythm section on records with the likes of Cat Power and Will
    Oldham, and on the evidence of the one seven-inch I have, they also shine when
    they collaborate as the Tren Brothers (""Kit's Choice"" is incredibly affecting).
    Meanwhile, violinist Warren Ellis has kept busy working on film scoring projects,
    along with playing with Nick Cave, among others. The <i>3 Pieces for Violin</i> EP
    is his first solo record, as well as one of the first releases on Mick Turner's
    King Crab label.  And keeping with the trend, it's superb.</p><p>
    
    Actually, the genesis of these pieces was also collaboration, this time with
    Canadian dance company Holy Body Tattoo. These three short tracks were originally
    a sonic backdrop to a piece called <i>Circa</i>, but don't worry, you don't need
    to be staring at stone-faced automatons in lyrca body stockings to enjoy the music.
    All serve as a fine showcase for Ellis' highly physical violin style, which moves
    easily between earthy folk and contemporary classical textures.</p><p>
    
    The latter is display on the first piece, in which a jarring, fiercely sawed
    opening with sharp edges of dissonance develops into an eerie, slithering melody
    with several overdubbed violins. As heard on <i>Whatever You Love, You Are</i>'s
    ""I Offered It Up to the Stars and the Night Sky,"" Ellis has a real knack for
    layering his violin parts, imparting a chamber music feel without forgoing his
    aggressive tone.</p><p>
    
    The second track finds Ellis heading in the direction of drone music. As one fiddle
    bows furiously on a single string, giving a rumbling undercurrent not unlike some
    of Cale's viola work with the Velvet Underground, he uses another track to spread
    an ethereal, almost Celtic melody on top. Track three is more relaxed and
    contemplative, starting with a plucked chord and then adding the kind of yearning,
    poignant lead line that Stradivarius designed the instrument for. His thick tone
    is certainly one of Ellis' calling cards, but his brilliant melodic sense is what
    makes his music so memorable, in and out of his main band.  Even though <i>3 Pieces
    for Violin</i> adds up to only 16 minutes of music, it's close to an essential
    purchase for Dirty Three fans.</p></div>"|2761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2761-3-pieces-for-violin-ep/|8.0|Mark Richard-San

    1940s. Some equivalent of Ken Burns would at some point make a 10-hour epic
    chronicling the rise of Slowdive, Ride, Chapterhouse, and most notably My Bloody
    Valentine, and the shoegazing equivalent of Dave Brubeck would counter the attacks
    of purists with pronouncements like, ""Any idiot can swirl.""</p><p>
    
    Somewhere in this imagined universe, the Emerald Down is firmly stuck in 1991
    playing shoegazer standards every Thursday night at a Holiday Inn lounge outside
    Columbus, maybe staring catatonically at their enormous, pink shag carpet-covered
    amplifiers while a small crowd of grey-faced business travelers work just intently
    on their whiskey sours at the bar.</p><p>
    
    It would take this kind of stylistic dominance, and the kind of sub-sub-genre
    stratification that would inevitably follow from critics, to tell apart and keep
    straight the hoards of faceless shoegazer bands that, to this day, keep cropping
    up inexplicably. I'm sure hardcore devotees of this style of music can recognize
    the subtle nuances separating all these bands that seem completely interchangeable
    to those of us who just dabble in what we consider the cream of the crop, but the
    debut from the Emerald Down, <i>Scream the Sound</i>, is so unabashedly retro that
    it just strikes me as sad. They've obviously invested a lot of time and energy
    into getting their imitation ""just right.""</p><p>
    
    The question is, why? Why make an album that not only has already been made, and
    not only been made better, but has been made better about 300 times over at last
    count. I guess every genre has room for the B and C-league acts, and there are
    certainly people out there who would eat this up, but there's really no need for
    this unless you already own the entire output of the above mentioned bands plus
    about a dozen other groups.  Still, there is something sickly endearing about a
    band so stuck in its own world that it refuses to acknowledge anything much has
    happened musically since the early 90s.</p><p>
    
    All the classic shoegazer touchstones are present on <i>Scream the Sound</i>:
    dense, layered production aesthetic, loads of guitars, everything buried in a
    primordial soup of sound, and an average song length of six minutes plus. The
    boy/girl vocals offer a nice touch, though that too has been done about a million
    times by shoegazer bands, and, besides, everything is covered in such a sonic
    glaze that all vocals are pretty much indistinguishable from one another.</p><p>
    
    Their idea of switching gears (like most bands of their ilk) is to flirt with
    shoegazer's daintier cousin, dream-pop. But this doesn't offer much in the way of
    variation, and even after three or four times through the album, nothing really
    stands out. If I had to pick one track, though, it would be ""Recondite Astral
    Traveler"" if only for the title alone, but it also has slightly more sinister,
    almost psychedelic feel to it. A close second would be ""Perilized,""  which
    strangely reminds me of Soft Cell's ""Sex Dwarf.""</p><p>
    
    But in the end, the album simply stands as yet another testament to how influential
    My Bloody Valentine was/is. Too much so, it seems. So dominant and pervasive is
    their sound that it has stifled much, if any, stylistic growth within the shoegazer
    genre, at least on anything above a microcosmic level. Ten years after <i>Loveless</i>,
    bands the world over (this particular one is from Columbus via Portland) are still
    eager to faithfully reenact the intoxicatingly dense swirl and shimmering feedback
    of Kevin Sheilds &amp; Co., showing little desire to push it forward. And the Emerald
    Down, like so many others, seem more than willing to be lost in sonic maelstrom.</p></div>"|2770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2770-scream-the-sound/|3.3|Jason Nickey

The sixth LP from Lambchop, everyone's favorite
    Nashville-based quatuordectet (fourteen members-- look it up!), has been released
    to generally positive murmuring from the bespectacled intelli-rock crowd.  To me,
    this indicates that Kurt Wagner and his Nashville friends have joined that
    exclusive herd of sacred musical cows, alongside their pals in Yo La Tengo.
    In the eyes of critics the world over, they seem to have been deemed untouchable.</p><p>
    
    Which is why I feel like I'm going to have my Music Critics Union (Local #462)
    card revoked when I say <i>Is a Woman</i> is a disappointment.  But before you
    lay down your harsh punishment, oh wise union magistrates, allow me to present
    the evidence for the album's underwhelming effect upon your humble supplicant.</p><p>
    
    I generally like Lambchop quite a bit.  Their last two albums of new stuff, 2000's
    <i>Nixon</i> and 1998's <i>What Another Man Spills</i>, collected genres like
    baseball cards and created an easy listening sound that soothed the soul without
    triggering the gag reflex.  As the band's makeshift orchestra performed horn and
    string swoops worthy of a Vegas-style lounge revue, Wagner's lyrics and off-kilter
    vocals provided just enough of a wink to indicate we were all in on the joke, and
    that it was okay to enjoy the music of our grandmothers.  (Hey, remember irony?)</p><p>
    
    But from the Vince Guaraldi-like instrumental intro of <i>Is a Women</i>'s opening
    track, ""The Daily Growl,"" it's apparent that the keyword for this outing is
    ""sparse.""  Fourteen people (twenty, if you count guests) have never sounded so
    quiet; throughout the album, Lambchop sounds less like the orchestra from ""Name
    That Tune,"" and more like a piano jazz group whose drummer took the night off.
    Gone, for the most part, is the genre-hopping, the falsetto, the lushness, and
    the cornet.  Dear God, why the cornet?!</p><p>
    
    Dangerously, the new sound would indicate that Wagner is taking himself a whole
    lot more seriously this time around, to less entertaining effect.  While his
    lyrics still have the ability to provoke many a double-take (by the second song,
    he's already name-dropped Chicken of the Sea, Intel, and Sherwin-Williams), the
    delivery is considerably more straightforward: less faux-crooner than <i>actual</i>
    crooner.  Wagner's aspirations to being the Dean Martin or Bing Crosby of indie
    rock have never been more obvious, and it's further made clear by the disturbingly
    high prominence of his voice in the mix (think Mark Kozelek on <i>Old Ramon</i> or
    <i>Bridge</i>).</p><p>
    
    The rest of the band, meanwhile, is largely relegated to the background or the
    occasional flourish, with the exception of Tony Crow's frequently front-and-center
    piano.  Admittedly, the sparing use of Lambchop's formerly characteristic
    orchestral sound is often striking: the honking baritone sax sprinkled into
    portions of ""The New Cobweb Summer,"" the softly resonating vibes and quivering
    Moog of ""Caterpillar.""  Also nice is the variously filtered angelic chorus
    answering Wagner's na-na's on ""I Can Hardly Spell My Name,"" and the sudden drop
    into lite-reggae halfway through the album-closing title track.</p><p>
    
    But the listener has to work through a great deal of less stimulating material
    before reaching these worthwhile moments, with most of the eleven tracks running
    at least five minutes.  Furthermore, the almost complete absence of significant
    drumming or percussion until the album's eighth track stretches the prolonged
    lull of ""My Blue Wave"" and ""The Old Matchbook Trick"" even longer.  With little
    rhythm to anchor songs of such epic length, they much too easily float off into
    the atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    Most tragic, though, is the startling uniformity of the album.  Save the stop/start
    strut of ""D. Scott Parsley,"" Lambchop has stripped away much of the country and
    soul influence that made previous work so hard to categorize.  What's left is a
    polished and subtle jazz-based sound that's hardly bad, but hardly good for more
    than intense bedroom headphone sessions or wine-and-cheese parties.</p><p>
    
    A small ass-covering caveat: <i>Is a Woman</i> sounds threateningly like a ""grower""
    album, the kind that suddenly clicks on the 108th listen as genius on the par of
    <i>Pet Sounds</i>, <i>Loveless</i>, or apparently, that new Trail of Dead album.
    If this is indeed the case, I'm sure I'll soon be run out of Criticsville by a
    torch-bearing mob, this embarrassingly short-sighted review preserved for all
    eternity in the Pitchfork archives.  Until that day, however, I throw myself upon
    the mercy of the court.</p></div>"|4659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4659-is-a-woman/|5.8|Rob Mitchum

    head off.  It doesn't even need to say anything or explain itself; it just lets

    Anderson's vocal geekshow and the band's artsy leanings set Racebannon apart from
    your average angry hardcore band.  They're a rock quartet that can rip through
    fast, high thrash.  But while the songs usually start loud and spastic, most of
    them run long-- half are over eight minutes-- and the extended writing, the
    interesting use of sounds, and the effective cover of Captain Beefheart's
    ""Electricity"" suggest there's an art band behind the violent facade.  Like the
    vocals, the guitars smear and spray as often as they make statements.  The rhythm
    section plays solid hardcore but it can also play freeform, as with the scattered
    hi-hats on ""I'm Yr Egomaniac.""  Racebannon also throw in effects, theremin, and
    on ""Egomaniac,"" some kind of bells or chiming glass sound.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, Racebannon never loses intensity no matter how long or complicated
    the music becomes.  Even the shorter songs like ""Flip n' Fuck"" or ""Fuck Yr Obvious
    Words"" transition from screaming thrash to effect-stricken outros, but the opening
    sections are strong enough to keep the rest of the song from wandering.  On the
    other hand, the best songs acquire an awesome magnitude as they ramble on.
    ""Clubber Lang"" kicks off with a great guitar riff and digs solidly into position
    behind Anderson's rant; as it jerks through the noises and gizmos of the ending,
    Anderson trails off into the distance.  The most interesting song on the album,
    the closer ""I'm Yr Egomaniac,"" builds dramatically with slow drones and the
    hi-hats and bell sounds mentioned above, while Anderson spits out an entire
    monologue.</p><p>
    
    Racebannon won't win over everybody.  As the label ""avant-noise-core"" suggests,
    they tend to push themselves into a niche.  Strict hardcore fans might balk at
    the long songs and instrumental sections, while people who don't dig hardcore at
    all will have trouble with the lack of melodies, hooks, or approachable beats.
    The recording is immaculate and surprisingly unabrasive, but it could stand to
    get messier.  (It's also a little shy on the low-end.)  You get the impression
    that the band is heavy, but not very heavy-- angry, but not aggressive.  No
    matter how ferocious and ugly it sounds, the ugliness is happening to somebody
    else.  But on those terms, it's a compelling and original album: there's a lot of
    appeal to kicking back and listening to these guys spill their troubles and
    frustrations.  You don't even need to catch all the words.</p></div>"|6633.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6633-in-the-grips-of-the-light/|7.4|Chris Dahlen

I love
    their $1 bins. I love the dusty stench that manages to conquer the reek of the
    fried-chicken place next door and wards off all but the most determined diggers.
    But more than anything, I love these bins because I've discovered so many great
    records in them.  One such gem is Circle's <i>Andexelt</i>.  Before Thursday
    afternoon I knew nothing of this Finnish band, but by the typography that reminded
    me of Brothomstates' <i>Claro</i> and the mechanized body-part photography that
    occupies the lowest sixth of the cover, I knew I should punt my buck.</p><p>
    After a thirty-minute metro ride home and enough time to brew a pot of coffee, I
    was ready to try out <i>Andexelt</i>. I'd lined up other discs just in case it,
    in fact, turned out to be Scandinavian doom metal or a cunning front for an area
    smooth jazz combo. I needn't have bothered.  <i>Andexelt</i> is still in my CD
    tray days later.  The album is pure krautrock and it is the most invigorating
    collection I've heard since a French Canadian called Charles-Émile sent me his
    debut album, <i>Nothing Down to Earth</i>.</p><p>
    Circle, I googled, are a five-piece who since 1991 have been astounding those just
    south of the Arctic Circle with their muscular explorations of space, time, and
    the pan-dimensional mega-riff. <i>Andexelt</i> is their seventh full-length, and
    you need to hear it often.  The record voyages to the same places as Les MacCann's
    <i>Layers</i>, but takes a different route. Grafting Neu!'s motorik percussion,
    Berlin-era Bowie synths to Robbie Shakespeare's dubby basslines and riding a
    guitar wave that recalls Black Sabbath and Michael Karoli, <i>Andexelt</i>
    surpasses Brainticket's <i>Adventure</i>, and equals Can's <i>Future Days</i> in
    loaded grace.</p><p>
    If this band were well-known, the Chemical Brothers would have already sampled
    Janne Peltomäki's rhythm-salvo of the opening title track, and music critics at
    large would already have acknowledged Circle's ferocity.  The band's guitarist,
    Teemu Elo, unloads a double-barreled reverb riff straight in your face, and while
    you're busy searching for bits of your head, frontman Jussi Lehtisalo's analog
    synth enters, intent on slicing to ribbons any sounds that cross its path.
    Fortunately, it's hard labor cutting away at Peltomäki's resilient groove. Elo
    and Lehtisalo form a cluster-bombing alliance against him, but the man relentlessly
    motoriks on.</p><p>
    For ""Odultept,"" the band jumps on the Fender Rhodes space-jazz and bolsters their
    move by allowing bassist J. Laiho to showcase his fits-and-starts dub-bass abilities.
    Guest T. Huunonen gives up a galactic flute solo after an explosion of ARP synths
    and the band decides to take a tour round the interstellar medium. ""20Milate"" is
    an Arkestral reworking of My Bloody Valentine's ""You Made Me Realize"" whereas
    ""Lisääpui"" mines the same Stooges treasury that Julian Cope's Brain Donor project
    did, except Circle got there first and stole the heavenly guitar line that
    Agitation Free's liquid-harmony guitarist Lutz Ulbrich had left behind. ""Humusaar""
    emerges from a doomy bass ground into a receding, FX-spattered star-field. And the
    brooding, numinous closer, ""Kidulgos,"" proves that Circle have processed Tangerine
    Dream's nebulous <i>Zeit</i> as well as the third-eye mantra of <i>Electronic
    Meditation</i>.</p><p>
<i>Andexelt</i> is astounding, no two ways about it.  All it's taken for me to get
    totally pumped up about this music has been a dollar. Yes, it may be a little more
    than a 10-10-321 collect call, but in that dusty bin, I found something actually
    worth talking up to twenty minutes about.</p></div>"|1475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1475-andexelt/|8.9|Paul Cooper

Promising fascination and intrigue beyond your
    wildest dreams, its distant melodies beckon you towards it while you try your very
    best to discern every distinct element that presents itself to you.  As you get
    closer and closer, you begin to relax, letting yourself become completely enveloped
    by the entrancing tones.</p><p>
    
    Of course, it's all a trap. Just as you begin to lose yourself, you become vaguely
    aware that the sound that soothingly beckoned you has now transformed into
    something vastly different-- something powerful, dangerous, and merciless. What
    was so beautiful at a safe distance is still beautiful, but what was once tranquil
    and peaceful has metamorphosed into a vicious, violent glory.  Before you can even
    respond, you're flat on your back, pulverized by its sheer force.</p><p>
    
    Making music that is both delicate and dangerous requires a level of skill that
    most musicians can barely even fathom. While some bands, like the Microphones,
    succeed at capturing the simultaneous beauty and rage of nature, what And You
    Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead have encapsulated on their third full-length,
    <i>Source Tags and Codes</i>, is something distinctly human. Anger has always
    played a central role in the band's music, but with this record, they've finally
    managed to capture all the subtle shades of disappointment, melancholy, frustration
    and hope that often accompany it.</p><p>
    
    Of course, capturing all this with music is no small feat.  <i>Source Tags and
    Codes</i> is massive in its execution, bursting with layered percussion, deftly
    arranged strings and, most importantly, songs that are simply epic. ""It Was There
    That I Saw You"" opens the album with squealing static and a clean guitar playing
    a simple, tickling figure. There's a palpable sense of excitement as the song
    suddenly explodes into a frenetic blast of crashing cymbals, screeching guitars,
    and thumping bass. Amidst the swell of sound, Conrad Keely's voice takes on a
    sharp, almost crystalline quality that cuts through the mix with biting force.</p><p>
    
    ""Another Morning Stoner"" mimics ""It Was There That I Saw You"" in its opening moments,
    but rather than exploding with pure energy, it builds slowly and deliberately to an
    absolutely astonishing finale. Melodic guitar lines ricochet back and forth, brought
    to new sonic elevations by soaring string arrangements. The call-and-response
    section that finishes the song, in which two members of the band exchange the
    phrases, ""What is forgiveness?/ It's just a dream/ What is forgiveness?/ It's
    everything,"" is one of many absolutely indelible moments on <i>Source Tags and
    Codes</i>.</p><p>
    
    ""Baudelaire"" follows the haunting ""Another Morning Stoner"" with a blast of pure
    rock and roll. Catchy and incredibly sinister, ""Baudelaire"" builds upon a central,
    immensely powerful guitar and trumpet riff with handclaps, driving percussion, and
    barely audible voices engaged in conversation.  Eventually, the song trails off
    into a single submerged guitar line accentuated by reverb-soaked bells.</p><p>
    
    Just as the hypnotic ending to ""Baudelaire"" pulls you into a trance, ""Homage""
    picks you up by the hair, smacks you around, spits in your face, and leaves you
    gasping for breath, before imploding into a symphony of static. ""How Near How Far""
    and ""Heart in the Hand of the Matter"" are the highlights of <i>Source Tags and
    Codes</i>' center, utterly alive with energy and texture. ""How Near How Far"" uses
    vocal harmonies and strings to reinforce a sense of violent melancholy, and the
    unforgettable chorus to ""Heart in the Hand of the Matter"" (""I'm so damned, I can't
    win"") is enlivened by the contrast between gritty guitars and clear, ringing piano.</p><p>
    
    After another expertly produced segue, ""Monsoon"" pulls together the rock swagger
    of ""Baudelaire"" and the sentimentality of ""Heart in the Hand of the Matter"" to
    wonderful effect. The songwriting on <i>Source Tags and Codes</i> is inconceivably
    elegant-- never predictable, but never gratuitously dissonant. Parts of songs wind
    seamlessly into each other, each one full of brilliant sonic nuances that are every
    bit as compelling when taken as part of the entire song as when examined individually.
    Fragmented feedback heralds the arrival of ""Days of Being Wild,"" a song that hosts
    some of the most creative instrumental interplay to grace this album, before
    building to yet another utterly awe-inspiring finale.</p><p>
<i>Source Tags and Codes</i> is an album big on finales-- thus, it makes sense that
    its three final tracks are quite possibly its best.  ""Relative Ways,"" which was
    released earlier this year as a single, is the most exquisitely constructed song
    here.  Conrad Keely's voice breaks and spits as he pleads, ""It's okay/ I'm a saint/
    I forgave/ Your mistakes."" An unexpected chord shift heightens the dramatic tension
    of the song just in time for it to return to its original theme and fade into
    ""After the Laughter,"" the only segue on <i>Source Tags and Codes</i> to be given
    its own track.  A stunning concoction of dreamy vocal harmonies, radio noises,
    pianos and strings, ""After the Laughter"" is wonderful in its own right, but taking
    into account the fact that the song perfectly bridges the melodies of ""Relative
    Ways"" and the album's closer, ""Source Tags and Codes,"" it seems utterly brilliant.</p><p>
    
    As with any epic album, <i>Source Tags and Codes</i> demands an epic closer, and
    the record's title track delivers masterfully.  Both a lyrical and melodic high
    point, ""Source Tags and Codes"" captures the complex emotions of the album in a
    brief glimpse of pure paradoxical beauty.  A perfect arrangement of the guitars,
    piano, strings, bells, and percussion that help make this record so intricate and
    powerful, the song sounds almost like a bittersweet reunion with old friends. A
    few seconds after last guitar has faded, a string ensemble plays a brief, gorgeous
    piece that is at once hopeful and somber. The strings end in unison on a single
    note, which is sustained for a few moments before fading out.  The impact is
    immediate: you know without a moment's doubt that you have just heard something
    that is absolutely classic.</p><p>
    
    And while <i>Source Tags and Codes</i> does seem to carry with it a certain
    knowledge of its own brilliance, it never tries to cheaply impress. Simply put,
    it doesn't need to. Dense, beautiful, intricate, haunting, explosive, and
    dangerous, this is everything rock music aspires to be: intense, incredible songs
    arranged perfectly and performed with skill and passion.  <i>Source Tags and
    Codes</i> will take you in, rip you to shreds, piece you together, lick your
    wounds clean, and send you back into the world with a concurrent sense of loss
    and hope.  And you will never, ever be the same.</p></div>"|178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/178-source-tags-and-codes/|10.0|Matt LeMay

It's not
    that the players were unfocused or naïve, but that they made a point not to do
    something which had already been done-- chiefly, to turn out ready-made product
    with the glossy veneer that had hooked the pro-pop junkies only ten years their
    senior.  They played their boisterous clamor for a few years, and moved on.</p><p>
    Next up was a more sophisticated brand of noise, though no less communicative for
    the change.  First, they dropped the youthful bravado in favor of hip wisdom
    beyond their years.  It's as if some weird muse had informed them that aiming for
    the intellect and modern mind could be cool, and unprecedented for bands like
    them.  Their friends followed their lead, and before you knew it, the arena that
    had once introduced them was now subject to their whims, at the service of their
    transitions.</p><p>
    Of course, this didn't last long, either.  Pretty soon, they were into all manner
    of trial media-- be it musical, cultural, or chemical-- and all of it managed to
    alter the music they played.  In fact, some would argue that these people met a
    crossroads during this time, as their public perception would forever be altered,
    due not only to their newly acquired avant-garde curiosity, but also to their
    completely comfortable way of passing through uncharted waters.  The only way out
    of this labyrinth was to step out of the game entirely, which, following suit and
    their like-minded brethren, they did.</p><p>
    The next phase was to attempt to recapture some of the green enthusiasm of their
    first days, albeit filtered through the inevitable change in their makeup from all
    the days of sophisticated, odd evolution.  Their music from this time was arguably
    the best they ever made, in spite of the fact that the actual players were probably
    growing a bit tired of the journey with one another, and that it would seem humans
    can only take so much change in so little a time.  But, for better or for worse,
    their friends went through the same things, and the trend was to always be at the
    forefront of the trip, so they persevered.</p><p>
    In fact, the players were on the verge of implosion.  They had reached a point
    where change no longer seemed relevant, and they decided to part ways rather than
    collectively grope for the next square.  And that was it.</p><p>
    This is the story of evolution and trends.  Most people think of evolution (beyond
    the religious implication of the term) as an inevitable phenomenon, like ice
    melting and then turning to gas vapor.  But when the concept of a trend comes up,
    particularly in art, it's viewed as a negative thing.  ""They're just following the
    trend,"" or, ""This will never last, it's just a trend.""  Well, sure, that's life,
    right?</p><p>
    And then there's the above story.  I read it, and thought ""The Beatles.""  Of
    course, it also applies to Can, Led Zeppelin, the Who, even Abba.  And if you
    take out the part about breaking up, it seems oddly close to the story of U2,
    R.E.M., Boredoms-- and let's stop here.  All this allegory gets a little weighty
    after a bit.</p><p>
    With Boredoms, you can actually see the evolution and trend from album to album.
    Most bands are like this.  But within the scene from which Boredoms are
    extrapolated, you can see this stuff spread throughout.  Rovo (unjustly pegged
    as a Boredoms side project, when in fact they are more the project of non-Bore
    violinist Katsui Yuji) have been around since 1998, and have generally played a
    kind of heavy-trance post-rock, like Tortoise with energy replacing atmosphere.
    Funny, though, if you took the exact same band members, and had them release a
    record in, say, 1991, it would almost certainly not sound like that.</p><p>
    Back then, Yuji was just starting out with Bondage Fruit playing avant-prog;
    guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto was making serious racket with the early, noisy
    Boredoms; drummer Yoshigaki Yasuhiro was playing free-jazz and industrial noise
    with very early Ground Zero; bassist Jin Harada was playing avant punk-prog with
    Bazooka Joe.  It was a noisy time.  Five years ago, the same players would have
    been playing something a tad more sophisticated, though always keeping an eye to
    improvisation and experimentation.  And today, they play beat-laden improv-trance.
    They aren't alone, because in Tokyo, Montreal and Chicago (and other places, too),
    this is the trend.  And if you think of trends and evolution as symbiotic
    occurrences, then bands like Rovo not only make sense; they sound absolutely
    wonderful.</p><p>
<i>Sai</i> is Rovo's fourth release, though their only record to be released in
    America was 1999's <i>Imago</i>.  For fans of the previous record, the sound remains
    essentially the same, with lengthy, repetitive jams featuring intricate percussion
    (courtesy of Yasuhiro and Okabe Yoichi's dual drum attack), profuse electronic
    manipulation (from Nakanishi Koji and co-producer Masuko Tatsuki), all colored by
    nylon and other strings (Yuji, Yamamoto and Harada).  This record isn't quite as
    influenced by IDM as <i>Imago</i> was, and transfers much of the percussive drive
    to more straightforwardly rock rhythm tracks.</p><p>
    The album begins with a track in Japanese, whose title I believe translates as
    ""Aurora Borealis.""  It begins with light, water-bounce synth effects, and gradually
    introduces the cymbals and hi-hat (major players on this album), rolling and
    swishing away.  This gives way to an actual beat, though it's closer to hard bop
    than gloomy post-rock.  Throughout, Yuji's violin wails in the distance, like a
    disembodied vocal (or more likely, an Eno-esque ambient cry).  But as underground
    Japanese musicians are wont to do, they play furiously where Western post-rockers
    would slide in unnoticed.  This is where the trend gives way to inherent,
    indigenous qualities.  There seems to be something restless in the air there, and
    despite all evidence of trance and hypnotic calm in the new style, they still play
    like free spirits.</p><p>
    ""Vida"" is the next track, leading off with an expository hi-hat duet (one drummer
    on the left side, the other on the right).  There's a sine-wave mediator to keep
    things colorful.  This slight diversion lasts better than three minutes (all four
    of the tracks here are over ten minutes long) before the band kicks in with a
    relatively straight, if rapid Krautrock groove-- drummers fighting in synch all
    the while.  Again, Yuji's violin colors the track, paired with various synth
    noises and textures, and Yamamoto's restrained strumming figures.</p><p>
    ""Rano"" begins with a bouncy keyboard figure similar to the first track, though
    this time accompanied by what sounds like a constant stream of water, spraying at
    its fancy in the background.  There are few radar blips before the rest of the
    players come in with <i>Sai</i>'s calmest tune.  An ostinato synth line, with
    equal parts wah-wah and analog pad resonance, fires away and the song crescendos
    to a double time trance-rock jam.  The best part of this album is that you could
    listen to it while tripping, letting it serve as support system for various
    epiphanies, or you could peer in to the detail, and be treated to incredible
    musicianship and a more compact sound than seven people would be expected to
    make.</p><p>
    The last tune is ""Seer,"" which again features the hi-hat duet, though here it's
    ridiculously precise where the earlier one was exploratory.  Drummers should
    get a kick out of this album, if no one else, though this stuff should work as
    well for laypeople-- and don't worry, there is a little guitar to fluff it up a
    bit!  Of course, Yamamoto seems to be playing with a velvet touch these days,
    a far cry from his Stooges-cum-Melvins skronk of the early part of the last
    decade.  I won't fault him for calming down any more than I fault Tortoise for
    not playing grunge.  First of all, it's not appropriate: this isn't 1991 anymore,
    and music, people and trends change.  Secondly, it isn't fair: why would I expect
    any musicians to exist in the narrow reality for which I have created for them?
    Thirdly, it's simply not smart: Rovo plays Rovo's music, not Boredoms', not
    Tortoise's, and no one else's.  Whatever the evolution of their scene, this is
    what they're doing now, and I think it sounds great.</p></div>"|6845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6845-sai/|8.2|Dominique Leone

    cream and cherries as a sublimated early childhood fondling at the hands of
    Barney.""</p><p>
    
    Op:1 Bastards: ""I'd sing 'If I Was Your Girlfriend' and really sex it up the way
    a true Finnish white boy can.  Then I'd lay it over some Casio organ and keep time
    with corny 80s handclaps and Afrika Bambaataa beats.  Then I'd wear one of those
    wicked red sun headbands like that guitarist did in the 'Little Red Corvette'
    video and spank Bobby Z saying, 'Who's your daddy!  Who's your daddy!' while
    Wendy and Lisa dripped hot wax down my back.  Or am I asking too much?""</p><p>
    
    Blue States: ""I'd work 'Alphabet Street' into a Marvin Gaye-style soul record.
    Not too shabby, eh?  At least it's different.""</p><p>
    
    Broadway Project w/Jeb Loy Nichols: ""I'd sing 'Jungle Love.'""</p><p>

    me to slither around humping the floor, it ain't happenin'.  That freak's
    perverted, man.  Someone ought to buy that guy a pole and lock him in the room
    alone for a few hours.  You know what Freud says about those hysterical types.
    I did the same thing for my dog Scrappy-- keeps him off my houseguests.  Now,
    Morris, that guy had class.  Should have given this Prince guy the beatdown when
    he had the chance.  Anyway, what do you suggest?""</p><p>
<i>""How about 'The Ballad of Dorothy Parker'""?</i></p><p>
    
    ""Fine, send over the chord changes and I'll be sure to fuck it up good.  You won't
    even recognize this shit when I get through with it.  I'll make the vocals really
    distant and rambling and suck all the soul out of it with a super sloppy rhythm
    track.  Just make it into a big wad of crap, word.""</p><p>
    
    Misty Dixon: ""I always thought 'The Beautiful Ones' was a gorgeous song.  I'd
    choose that and strip it down, give it more of an acoustic sound, piano, maybe a
    glockenspiel and pull out all of that crazy screaming at the climax.  It won't be
    Prince's apotheosis-- what do you expect?-- but it will still sound pretty good.""</p><p>
<i>""I don't know if you guys should go through with this. I mean, covering Prince is
    kind of like covering the Beatles: it sounds like a good idea at the time, but
    inevitably you just end up embarrassing yourself and everyone realizes why they
    were so good and you're so, well... sorry, average.  Or worse.  A few of you sound
    like you'll contribute something worth hearing and I think it's always helpful to
    hear an artist's work reinterpreted.  Either something interesting comes out, or
    you gain a new appreciation for the original. You've got great songs to work with,
    so 75% of the work is taken care of already, but I'm not sure that's worth the
    price of admission.  I hate to inflate the Purple One's ego further, but I'd
    suggest that my friends stick to the originals, or, if this thing actually hits
    the shelves, to wait until you stumble across a cut-out in the used bin.""</i></p></div>"|6478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6478-if-i-was-prince/|5.0|Nathan Rooney

    Beach Boys are a significant influence upon approximately 58% of today's indie
    rock bands.  Yeah, maybe this should've been obvious to me a lot earlier.  But
    bear in mind that my formative Beach Boys experiences were a 1986 concert by
    the dreadful ""Kokomo""-era Mike Love incarnation I saw with my parents, and that
    ""Full House"" episode where John Stamos filled in on drums.  Horrifying.</p><p>
    
    Even in my recent enlightened state, I'm still surprised at the ubiquity of the
    Brian Wilson Sound, given that it only produced one album unanimously considered
    to be a masterpiece.  Perhaps the Beach Boys continually open peoples' eyes to a
    variety of elements: the un-ironic falsetto vocal, the joy of nonsense-syllable
    lyrics (e.g. ba-ba-ba's and dooby-doo's), the tasteful blending-in of orchestral
    instruments, and the use of crystalline harmonies.  Or maybe today's indie rock
    horde saw themselves as responsible for fulfilling the potential lost when Wilson
    surrendered to his insanity and his bed during the <i>Smile</i> sessions.</p><p>
    
    Wait a minute, who is this review about again?  Oh, right, AM/FM.</p><p>
    
    To pigeon-hole AM/FM as yet another Beach Boys homage would be overly simplistic--
    the band seems less directly inspired by Wilson &amp; Co. than by bands who are
    themselves inspired by the Beach Boys-- not to mention Nick Drake and his legions
    of clinically depressed devotees, or more contemporary artists like the Coctails
    and Death Cab for Cutie.  All of the above can be heard in the sonic casserole
    of <i>Getting into Sinking</i>, to various degrees.</p><p>
    
    But still, it's the Beach Boys thing that I can't get out of my head, and I think
    it's caused by more than the duo's frolicking-through-sand-and-surf cover art.
    Brian Sokel and Michael Parsell have a knack for dreaming up melodies that sound
    familiar without sounding derivative, then tactfully using a wide arsenal of
    instruments to flesh out their vision.  And it's all packaged up with the optimism
    and pep of a pre-manic depression, pinstripe suit-wearing Brian Wilson.</p><p>
<i>Getting into Sinking</i> bursts out of the gate with the anthemic ""Virgins!
    Virgins!"" and ""If We Burned All the Assholes the Earth Would Look Like the Sun,""
    two songs with titles more appropriate for a Slipknot album, but harboring content
    that glitters with pop sensibility.  The former combines lovestruck backing vocals,
    reverb-drenched guitar, and lazy drums into a package so smiley-faced I can
    (barely) forgive lyrics like, ""There are so many songs about rainbows/ But what's
    on the other side?""  ""If We Burned"" has a similar flair, carrying a hook like a
    pirate-ship captain, and working up a joyous cacophony by throwing in the some
    Elephant Six circus-style horns.</p><p>
    
    The album never again reaches the heights of these opening tracks, but bounces
    enjoyably between sunshine daydreams and AM/FM getting their Garfunkel on: a
    fairly straight reading of Leonard Cohen's ""Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye""
    and the coffee-shop folk of ""I Was Never Here Two Seconds Ago.""  Missteps come
    from the exceptions to this formula, like ""It Fell Out of My Head,"" where the
    programmed percussion, repetitive guitar riff, and jarring chants sound like a
    less feminist and less catchy Le Tigre.  ""Come Suck Down a Cloud"" attempts to
    build to a choir-fueled climax, but seems flat and forced compared to the album's
    simpler tunes.</p><p>
<i>Getting into Sinking</i> comes off like an album engineered for springtime,
    where the increasing temperatures and longer daytimes make even the hardest heart
    vulnerable to a innocently catchy song's viral attack.  The dozen tracks within
    may not be the most memorable or groundbreaking ever recorded, but AM/FM's
    cheeriness is contagious enough to inspire nationwide Frisbee-throwing.  Somewhere,
    Brian Wilson tips his fireman's hat.</p></div>"|145.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/145-getting-into-sinking/|7.5|Rob Mitchum

    --Ben Gibbard, ""Stability""</p><p>
    Aside from being a rather nice turn of phrase, this line from the title track
    of Death Cab for Cutie's new EP strikes me as oddly universal.  That's not to
    say it applies to all people or memories, but it does bring up an interesting
    point, especially with regard to music.  Given that music is a time-based art
    form, relying on the passage of minutes and seconds (or sometimes hours) to
    make its impact and relay its message, I sometimes get to thinking about what
    it would be like to listen to music if you had no memory.</p><p>
    I'm pretty sure I first had this thought while exiting the theater after a
    showing of <i>Memento</i>.  For those of you who haven't seen the film, it
    centers around a man who, after being attacked, loses the ability to form
    short-term memories.  Without those memories, attachments become difficult to
    form, and his life begins to lose meaning altogether.  It's actually quite a
    terrifying concept.</p><p>
    Transposing this to music, think about how it would change the way you listened
    to things.  First, you'd have no frame of reference for what you were listening
    to-- it would essentially be pure sound.  Secondly, if your frame of memory were
    extremely short (say, five or so seconds) repetition would become basically
    meaningless.  In the West, music relies so heavily on repetition to be successful
    that I think it would be interesting to see how the average pop song would fare
    without that benefit.  I've often thought that I'd love to experience music from
    that standpoint for just one day, if only to gain a fresh perspective.</p><p>
    Of course, this isn't what Gibbard is getting at.  Rather, he's referring in
    somewhat abstract terms to those little nagging memories that we can't seem to
    make disappear, no matter how hard we try.  This is often his topic of choice for
    lyrics, but don't think for a second that this is a typical Death Cab for Cutie
    release.   With these two originals and one Björk cover, we find the Bellingham,
    Washington-based quartet exploring musical directions they've never fully headed
    in before, though listening back through their other records, you can find hints
    of this direction if you know what you're looking for.</p><p>
    The EP opens with ""20th Century Towers,"" a wasted, incredibly slow song that
    hangs on the barest of rhythmic frameworks.  ""I know the conscious choice was
    crystal clear/ To clear the slate of former years/ When I sang softly in your
    ear/ And tied these arms around you,"" sings Gibbard over Nick Harmer's swelling
    bassline, minimal guitar parts and somnambulant drums.  The song's strange climax
    comes after Gibbard sings the line, ""Keeping busy is just wasting time/ And I've
    wasted what little he gave me,"" when the entire band joins to sing only two words--
    ""All around""-- in harmony.  The guitars become steadily more active after this
    point, with Gibbard and Chris Walla each playing a part on separate channels,
    making for an interesting stereo effect.</p><p>
    Strangely, the band's cover of Björk's ""All Is Full of Love"" is both the most
    typical-sounding and the most propulsive of <i>Stability</i>'s three tracks.
    Drummer Michael Schorr lays down a distinctive beat, mostly on his toms,
    immediately setting the version apart from the ambient, drumless original.
    Gibbard handles the vocal nicely, which isn't really too surprising, seeing
    as he and Björk sing in almost the same range.  It certainly does not better
    the original, but I suspect it would at least work well in the car.  Overall,
    it does what a good cover should do: it takes a fine original and adopts it to
    the band's own style, as opposed to copying it note-for-note.</p><p>
    And then there's the 13-minute long title track.  The first few minutes are
    affecting, plaintive and slow, very much in a similar vein with ""20th Century
    Towers.""  The rhythm is far more insistent and steady, though, and things swell
    more quickly.  Gibbard is joined by John Vanderslice, who sings backup on most of
    the song's vocal section.  After the verses end, the song continues for nine
    minutes, with the apparition of Gibbard singing far in the background, and
    Walla's guitar playing a sparse part over molasses drums and bass.  Vanderslice
    contributes some synth textures which help things bit, but in the end, this seems
    like one case where a lack of musical memory might be a good thing.  That way,
    you at least couldn't tell how bloody long it is.</p><p>
    The main problem is that the band doesn't really do anything interesting in that
    nine-minute span.  There's no buildup of tension or subsequent release, and
    Vanderslice can only offer so much variation with his sustained synth chords and
    volume swells.  If nothing else, I suppose it serves as a decent cure for insomnia.
    At any rate, it just sort of peters out at the end, keeping the EP from feeling
    like a fully realized statement.</p><p>
    For those new to the Death Cab for Cutie camp, I'd say <i>We Have the Facts and
    Are Voting Yes</i> still stands as the best entry point, but the true fans might
    be into this new disc.  It shows a side of the band that we only rarely get to
    see, and only briefly at that.  Some fans may actually own it already, if they
    happened to purchase the limited edition first pressing of last year's <i>The
    Photo Album</i> or the Japanese import version of that album.  For those who
    don't, <i>Stability</i> reveals a promising new dimension to Death Cab's sound
    that, in non-epic doses, could do wonders for their future releases.</p></div>"|2228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2228-the-stability-ep/|6.9|Joe Tangari

When you look at the kind of
    people who have made it through the last few decades of music in one piece,
    it's hard to argue that many survived.  I'm not referring to the ones who came
    out clean, or who learned their painful lessons of youth and chaotic growth.
    Actually, when I think of musicians like that (Brian Wilson, the Beastie Boys
    and Iggy Pop, to name just a few), they don't seem like real survivors to me.
    They just seem like they got old.  And that isn't romantic, exciting or even
    evitable.</p><p>
    
    The survivors I love are the ones that made it this far in one piece-- the same
    piece they started with.  How rare is it when an artist wields the same powers
    of persuasion and attraction twenty years down the road as they did when they
    made their big bang?  There are always going to be diehards who support them
    through and through, and maybe there's something to be said of the personal
    connection an artist makes with his or her audience that could lead to such
    devotion.  But, there is a school of thought that doesn't believe in that.
    Chiefly, the angels who are impervious to trend, age and metabolism are the
    ones that glow brightest for me.</p><p>
    
    Now, this is idealistic, narrow minded and deeply unfair.  It's a plan destined
    to fail; so says nature.  But I picked it up somewhere, and it's hard to let go.
    I can defend some artists using this aesthetic, or I can just say that I like
    them because of whatever, and leave it at that.  I can defend Tom Waits in this
    way.  I can defend Boredoms in this way, and theoretically, I can defend John
    Zorn in this way (I'm not sure I really believe he's still truly surviving,
    though he has certainly made it further than most).  I can also defend KK Null
    in this way, and though I never have, it's easy enough.</p><p>
    
    Null started playing about twenty years ago, and began playing with his band Zeni
    Geva in 1987.  They were a harsh, brutally intense band then.  They still are,
    even though I don't always like everything they play.  Null also releases solo
    albums, featuring his guitar, voice and other tools that are so often frustrating,
    disparate artistic statements that I really have to question why I'd ever consider
    him an admirable person.  He isn't just making noise, but he isn't making friends,
    either.  I can't get a handle on what he's doing all the time, even when I think
    it's beautiful (check <i>A New Kind of Water</i>, his collaboration with Jim
    O'Rourke if you suspect me, and why wouldn't you?).  But he isn't less difficult
    now than he used to be.  He hasn't lost the ability to change my mood.  KK Null
    is as powerful an artist (not something inherently good or bad, but merely the
    basis of my dilemma, in this case) now as ever, and he shows little indication of
    burning out.  Indeed, I admire KK Null for that.</p><p>
<i>Peak of Nothingness</i> is at once the embodiment of its title, and an act of
    false humility.  Null has packed away his guitar for the vacuum comfort of a
    laptop.  His press release says ""bleep core,"" which is as desperate a use to
    insert ""core"" into a genre as I've heard, especially considering that most of
    the time this album doesn't seem designed to purify or intensify (which is what
    I figure people mean when they append ""core"" to something) anything other than
    Null's interest in new composition.  It isn't a record that I feel commanded to
    praise, though it's quite accomplished for someone who supposedly never made this
    kind of music before.  But it is interesting, and it is something that strikes
    similar chords as when I first heard Zeni Geva.  I want to hear more of him doing
    this, because I'm curious about where he'll turn, what mistakes he'll expose and
    what he might uncover along the way.</p><p>
    
    Two of the pieces on <i>Peak of Nothingness</i> are quite grating, at least
    comparatively speaking.  The first track (none of these songs have names-- Null
    uses running times in lieu of titles here) lasts barely over a minute, and features
    very distorted panned sounds and a slowly building shudder in the left speaker.
    It almost sounds like some kind of interstellar tennis match, with perhaps someone
    playing ""Atari Combat"" in the background.  It leads without break to the second
    track, featuring a non-wavering metronome pulse with an ultra-high sine wave over
    the top.  The last track is more like the sound of a digital construction site,
    with constantly running generator and oscillating power drills.  It's a lengthy
    piece of music, most likely improvised (as was about half of the album, apparently),
    and I'm hesitant to describe it as ""industrial"" because of conditioned musical
    connotations, though of course it is.</p><p>
    
    The remaining ten tracks are much softer, and often display subtlety for which
    Null is rarely credited.  The third track brings back the sine wave and a few
    glitches every now and then, but these sound like real glitches-- i.e. mistakes,
    rather than strategically placed sputters and pops.  Maybe this is the modern
    equivalent to ambient music.  Or, maybe it's just a buzzing hum that means nothing.
    It's frustrating, and I like it.  Track seven actually increases the volume (and
    static), and comes close to sounding like Fennesz, though Null has an even looser
    affiliation with melody than the Austrian.</p><p>
    
    The fourth track is little but a soft electronic pulse, which summons passive
    techno demons by virtue of its consistency, but almost certainly accidentally.
    Track five keeps the consistent patterns, but translates them as hypnotic,
    dimensional sinoids, spinning across the speakers.  There's a little radio static
    to give the piece color, but it's quite an impressive use of space with a
    ridiculously limited palette of sound.  Again, this record may not be essential
    listening, but small pleasures abound.</p><p>
    
    The only drawback with Null is that you never know if he'll ever return to this
    music again.  There are so many ideas here, so many possibilities to explore, and
    yet I wouldn't be surprised if he was already beyond it.  That said, laptops do
    seem to be the way of the world these days, and a vital artist rarely wastes an
    opportunity to make a statement on new toys.  Of course, Null will probably
    survive one way or another.</p></div>"|5856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5856-peak-of-nothingness/|8.0|Dominique Leone

People's individual definitions of ""heavy
    music"" vary quite a bit, but when I say it, I mean music that aims to be heavy
    in the bone-crushing sense-- usually metal or hardcore.  I never went through a
    Metallica and/or Megadeth phase in school, and I never got into Earth Crisis when
    I discovered punk.  I like plenty of noisy stuff, but browsing through my
    collection, you're not likely to find much that the average listener would call
    ""brutal.""</p><p>
    
    My friends are pretty well aware of this, and virtually every one of them has
    reacted with a certain amount of shock when they've heard Mad Capsule Markets
    blaring from my stereo.  And it's true-- <i>OSC-DIS</i> may be the heaviest album
    I own, yet I've been playing the hell out of it.  For some reason, it speaks to
    me in a way most music of its ilk doesn't.</p><p>
    
    There are a lot of reasons for this, and the primary one is probably that, for all
    of their stuttering riffs, dropped tunings and double bass fills, Mad Capsule
    Markets are never lacking in the melodic department, which makes listening a lot
    easier.  It could also have something to do with the cultural filter the music is
    being sifted through before it gets to me.  See, these guys are from Japan, and
    they approach their music with a certain open-minded eclecticism that seems to
    characterize a lot of the music coming from that country these days.</p><p>
    
    I think one of the reasons a lot of Americans find Japanese music so fascinating
    is that it's such an incredibly pure synthesis of influences.  Punk, surf,
    industrial, prog, radio-ready pop, and just about any other genre you can think
    of are all treated equally, and don't carry the same baggage in Japan as they do
    in the U.S.  Thus, Mad Capsule Markets' ninth album (their second available in
    the States) pours all of those genres and more into a 40-minute adrenaline blast
    that never gets tiring.</p><p>
    
    Released in Japan in 1999, this album has already spawned five major hits for the
    band in their homeland, and it's easy to see why.  Given a fair shake on radio in
    the U.S., I could see it enjoying a similar reign here, despite the fact that the
    band veers back and forth between English and Japanese lyrics (often in the
    same song).</p><p>
    
    Vocalist Kyono ably alternates scattershot raps, deep growls and melodic singing,
    constantly switching approaches, while bassist/programmer Takeshi Ueda and
    drummer/programmer Motokatsu Miyagami lay down an intense rhythmic onslaught
    designed to alternately move your ass and pummel it into oblivion.  The odd
    guitar works its way into the mix here and there, but for the most part, Ueda
    handles everything with his bass, dishing up clean, elastic lines and
    window-rattling, distorted figures with equal aplomb.</p><p>
<i>OSC-DIS</i> opens with the pulsating electronic rhythms and four-on-the-floor
    kick drum of ""Tribe"" before blasting into the first of many blistering choruses.
    Admittedly, the lyrics don't translate that well, but the increase in heart rate
    the song provides renders any concerns like that pretty well moot.  ""Out/Definition""
    follows, layering Miyagami's octopedal kit drumming on top of frenetic drum
    programs and weaving loops of Kyono's filtered screaming into the heavily
    distorted bassline to create a dense low-end texture that supports the
    semi-melodic rapping taking place in the foreground.</p><p>
    
    ""N (Pulse)"" bursts with melodies indebted to West Coast surf and old school UK
    punk while the music churns violently underneath, injecting thunderous stuttering
    passages after each chorus.  Occasionally, the keyboard programming comes close
    to the Mutant New Wave of the Tokyo-based band Polysics (such as on ""Multiplies""),
    though it's always featured lower in the mix.  The brief ""Mob Track"" is one of
    the few tracks that subverts melody altogether, in favor of head spinning,
    industrial drum programming and meat-grinder bass not terribly far removed any
    of the hundreds of projects Alec Empire has put his name on.  (That's a good thing
    here, by the way.)</p><p>
    
    It's followed by the highly melodic, surf-drenched ""All the Time in Sunny Beach,""
    which features lyrics about literally walking around on a sunny beach, a
    hilariously mundane topic when you consider the urgency with which it's sung.
    This gives way to ""Island,"" the real odd duck in this flock.  The only song to
    feature guitar prominently, it sports verses that could easily be mistaken for
    the slow track on a mid-80s jangle pop album, complete with ""ooh ooh"" backing
    vocals (albeit with distorted lead vocals).  These verses alternate with full-on
    hardcore punk choruses that feel strangely appropriate regardless of the
    abruptness they enter with.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>OSC-DIS</i> swings wildly between the thrashing digital metal of
    ""Restart!"" and ""Jag,"" the buzzy jungle-punk of ""Step into Yourself,"" and the
    almost bouncy pop-punk of ""Good Girl (Dedicated to Bride After 20 Years),""
    naturally cut though with ridiculously heavy passages that would make Blink 182
    soil themselves.  Then, it all ends with ""Midi Surf,"" an aptly titled number that
    ties together all of the album's musical threads, with heavy as hell verses,
    rapped pre-choruses, freakishly fast drumming and a heavily melodic chorus.
    Sequenced rhythms lurk in every corner of the mix, pushing the song even harder
    toward its abrupt conclusion, which ends the album in just about the exact right
    amount of time.</p><p>
    
    So, overall, the Mad Capsule Markets have it going on in spades, grabbing your
    adrenal glands and squeezing them as hard as possible.  God knows what their
    name means (I suspect it's an odd translation of some sort of drug reference),
    but I hope that doesn't keep people from noticing this band.  Like I said before,
    I've never really been into heavy music, but this gets my full endorsement.</p></div>"|5025.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5025-osc-dis-oscillator-in-distortion/|8.2|Joe Tangari

The advent of the
    Gothic era found architects consciously testing the limitations of their craft as
    the European countryside became home to freemasons fueled by religious fervor, the
    first inklings of humanism, and the sole intent of creating the largest damn
    cathedral this side of Bayeux. Spires crept precariously higher and higher as the
    movement progressed, yet many designers continued to adorn their work with
    intricate stone-tracery in lieu of buttresses and other such means of foundation.
    The logical constraints of gravity that had long antagonized their art no longer
    seemed to concern many, as they immersed themselves in ""embellishment"" and paid
    little or no attention to the shortcomings of their tools.</p><p>
    Naturally, many of their achievements were only temporary additions to the
    landscape; some crumbled before their completion while others managed to withstand
    only a few years.  Had their designers not been so deterred by an exalted pissing
    contest, they may have actually built something with enough stamina and integrity
    to endure time's heavy toll. It just goes to show you that a little perspective
    goes a long way.  Likewise, if a latter day gothic architect were to gaze upon
    the excessive sonic weight bore by any (International) Noise Conspiracy song,
    even he'd tell you that shit was ready to collapse.</p><p>
    With Refused, the music of Dennis Lyxzén had a foundation strong enough to support
    the occasional interjections of electronica, jazz, and whatever other assorted
    weirdness he and his fellow Swedes conjured up in the studio. In fact, by the time
    the group had recorded their swan song, the excellent <i>The Shape of Punk to Come</i>,
    they had begun to invert the genre's oft-formulaic sound by cohesively weaving
    whole sections of evocative ambient noise into the mix.  Now, having left the safe
    folds of Refused for the infinitely more didactic and uninspired (International)
    Noise Conspiracy, Lyxzén and partner Lars Strömberg turn to derivative song
    structures that try in vain to hold up the unwieldy mix of two effect-happy
    guitars, an incessant saxophone, clumsy keyboards, and Lyxzén's sub-par James
    Brown impression for over 45 minutes. Forgive me if I flee the scene for fear of
    imminent implosion.</p><p>
<i>A New Morning, Changing Weather</i>, the Conspiracy's sophomore effort,
    showcases the group's ability to liberally borrow from the Scorpions, Spinal Tap,
    and Nation of Ulysses without shame. ""Born into a Mess"" actually sounds like an
    über-rendition of ""Sex Farm"" (albeit, with an overtly Marxist slant). Much is
    made of the group's communist rhetoric, which is exemplified by an, admittedly,
    impressive reading list contained amidst the album's liner notes. But I've yet to
    understand how lyrics such as, ""I blow my mind everyday/ Turn on your love lights
    and let them shine on me,"" is supposed to incite a mass meditation on the flaws in
    modern economic procedure. Social commentary occasionally surfaces in the form of
    either puerile prose or oblique randomness, or sometimes, in an uninsightful
    succession of buzzwords. An example: ""Situations symptomatic/ Define the
    objectified and celebrate the phallic/ To deconstruct this before we run out of
    time.""  Sounds like Foucault as interpreted by Trent Reznor.</p><p>
    The most offensive thing about <i>A New Morning</i> is how generic it sounds.
    There's little-to-no variation in tempo, instrumentation, or aesthetic appeal,
    imbuing the album with all the emotional scope of Ben Stein. Lyxzén and Strömberg's
    exchange of guttural yelps and uh-huh's are sung in a perpetual state of
    over-emphasis, belying the triviality of their lyrical content. Even the various
    spots throughout the record in which the musicians are afforded the chance to
    experiment seem nothing more than afterthoughts conceived once the respective
    songs had already been arranged, and often come off as nothing more than ZOOM
    pedal wankery.</p><p>
    Lyxzén's preoccupation with approximating the angst of teenage suburbia will sell
    a lot of albums amongst the burgeoning screamo crowd. Will he pull his album from
    the shelves when he hears that ""Capitalism Stole My Virginity"" is being played
    round the clock on M2, or at the local shopping mall?  Probably not, but from what
    I can discern, the (International) Noise Conspiracy are at a far greater impasse.
    If their intention is to invoke the spirit of revolution in their fans, they need
    to offer a coherent and appealing alternative to the status quo and reflect it in
    their music.  If their goal is to ascend to the upper echelons of hair-metal,
    they're only one virtuoso guitar solo away.</p></div>"|4110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4110-a-new-morning-changing-weather/|3.5|Kevin Adickes

It's time we all put our minds together and came up
    with a new name for the genre known as ""post-rock.""  Now, genre labels are never
    very descriptive, and usually serve merely as a crutch for writers and a denial
    target for musicians (""We're not emo!"" a thousand bespectacled bands cry).  But
    they do serve some purpose as a sort of critical shorthand-- I tell you a band is
    new-wave synth-pop, and your brain instantly dials up an approximate framework
    for the music at hand.</p><p>
    Post-rock is an especially faulty term, however, since it says almost nothing
    about a band's sound, other than it being somehow ""after rock.""  It's sort of
    like describing an especially tasty dinner as being post-lunch.  What else can
    we call it then?  One could go back to the genre's obvious roots in King
    Crimson-style complexity and call it neo-prog, or something more futuristic,
    like prog-o-tron.  If it's important to tip a hat to the music's German origins,
    Ameri-Kraut might catch on.  Or we could all just tell it like it is and label
    it pretentious-core.  I'm open to suggestions.</p><p>
    All this semantics-wrassling is provoked by 90 Day Men, an act that many would
    most likely lump into post-rock or math-rock circles.  On <i>To Everybody</i>,
    their second album, the St. Louis quartet may possibly be addressing this problem
    of classification by naming a track, ""We Blame Chicago,"" indicting the geographic
    center of post-rock with charges of beating the genre into clichédom.  That's
    just a wild guess, and only the 90 Day Men know the real story behind the title,
    but <i>To Everybody</i> comes across as just such a challenge to the scene.</p><p>
    The first three minutes of the opening track, ""I've Got Designs on You,"" led me to
    think that the album had little in store, with Dianogah's melodic bass, Don
    Caballero's gymnastic drumming and an irritating pinched whine for vocals.
    However, after eight minutes of bobsled run twists and turns (sorry, too much
    Olympics), I was hooked.  What happened?  Well, the addition of Brian Case's
    textured guitars and more restrained counterpoint vocals didn't hurt.  But the
    real kicker is Andy Lansangan's piano, which slowly enters the fray before taking
    control and allowing the composition to achieve liftoff.</p><p>
    Piano, you say?  Big frickin' deal, you say.  I'm gonna go see what else Pitchfork
    reviewed today, you say.  Shut up and sit down, I say.  While the piano might not
    be the most advanced of instruments, Lansangan uses it to great effect on <i>To
    Everybody</i>, adding much-needed warmth and melody to 90 Day Men's sound.  Where
    the band's previous effort, 1999's <i>(It (Is) It) Critical Band</i>, occasionally
    sank into the sludge of an overly busy rhythm section, Lansangan's inventive
    playing has the band in a much more balanced state instrumentally.</p><p>
    No one song showcases their new strengths like the aforementioned ""We Blame
    Chicago,"" a piano and wah-wah-driven piece that swoops and darts through two
    tuneful movements, disintegrates into noise, then returns triumphantly to the
    original theme.  90 Day Men function like a musical assembly line, with each
    member playing simple phrases that add up to a cohesive and complex whole.  While
    many bands that take this approach sound overly choreographed and rigid,
    Lansangan's jazzy style keeps things loose, giving off at least the appearance of
    improvisational energy.</p><p>
    ""St. Theresa in Ecstasy"" and ""A National Car Crash"" follow a stretched out version
    of the same blueprint, slowly assembling an intricate pyramid of sound before
    destroying it all like an angry toddler, only to rebuild it even higher.  While
    the former says less than it probably should over its near nine-minute length,
    the latter closes the album with a fiery display of tension-release dynamics.</p><p>
    If 90 Day Men have a weakpoint, it's in their vocals, which are predominantly used
    as just another color of yarn to knit into their musical scarf.  That most singing
    gets buried in the mix is perhaps a wise decision, as only the brief, aerobic ""Last
    Night a DJ Saved My Life"" reaches minimum singalong-ability.  When the vocals are
    too prominently displayed they distract from the music beneath, or at worst, are
    wincingly melodramatic (""Alligator,"" where the band's prog side gets the best of
    them).</p><p>
    90 Day Men are also smart enough to know that listeners can only handle so much of
    their dense, sinister sound in one sitting, and keep the album at a lean, mean
    forty-minute length.  And despite a few missteps, <i>To Everybody</i> indicates
    that the 90 Day Men are a band to watch in the Ameri-Kraut arena, using familiar
    ingredients but to greater effect.  It may even end up being one of the better
    prog-o-tron releases of 2002.  What do you think, are they catching on?</p></div>"|5806.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5806-to-everybody/|7.8|Rob Mitchum

    pretentious ramblings, if you've ever picked up a record because we told you to;
    then please, dear readers, do yourself a favor. Stop reading this review now and
    tear yourself away from that Spoon album.  Then, buy/burn/download/steal/or
    otherwise get hold of a copy of the Shalabi Effect's <i>The Trial of St-Orange</i>.
    Go listen and then come back. Because if you don't, if you read this review before
    you hear the album, it'll spoil all the surprises.</p><p>
    Yes, that's right, oh wearied music listener: surprises! The unexpected! When was
    the last time you heard an album that genuinely surprised you again and again?
    When was the last time you threw an album on in the background, only to find
    yourself torn from wherever your attention was supposed to be focused because the
    music was doing things you absolutely did not expect it to? Because this is what
    happened to my jaded ass, and I haven't been happier in ages. Not only does the
    Shalabi Effect surprise upon its virgin spin, it continues to reveal new elements
    with each consecutive listen. But still, that initial <i>St. Orange</i> session
    is a wonderful experience. And I'd rather not rob anyone of it. But alas, a job
    is a job, so for better or worse, here goes:</p><p>
    A primal feel is established from the disc's opening moments. An acoustic guitar
    is plucked as faint percussion falls like raindrops over ubiquitous natural field
    recordings-- bird songs, forest sounds, etc.-- placed at far intervals.  Periodic
    gong soundings emerge.  At first, the metal is allowed to resonate in a mostly
    empty space, but soon the field recordings grow far less distant.</p><p>
    As we move into the second track, ""Sister Sleep"" (there are only three movements
    here, but there are seven individual tracks), the field recordings grow less
    sparse, and much louder. These sounds dominate the mix, effects are added, and
    the results are placed into loops. Soon, the random percussion falls into line
    like soldiers at attention. Rapid-fire hand-percussion serves as a counterpoint
    for the electronic sounds and fragmented guitar that creep slowly from the
    soundworld like the legs on one of those bugs that show up on humid days in
    basements and garden apartments. Thus begins a slow transformation from sparse,
    yet identifiable sounds into all-encompassing ethereal noise. It's easy to miss
    the certain subtleties in this disc the first time through-- you don't realize
    what you've heard until it mutates into something different.</p><p>
    This is best exemplified on the next track, ""Mr. Titz (The Revelator)""-- and if
    you were wondering why this album isn't rated a solid 10.0, look no further than
    that title-- when the heavenly noise falls out entirely, leaving behind nothing
    but a quick, repeating bassline.  There's a very brief vocal sample, kicking off
    a race between Will Eizlini's North Indian hand percussion and Sam Shalabi's
    frantically repeated guitar part.  All the while, electronics float about, growing
    more comfortable with the idea of structure every minute.  But the listener doesn't
    realize the development of the electronics part until the song transforms altogether
    into a straightforward drum machine roll, taking the movement in a whole new
    direction.</p><p>
    I could gladly go on. I could write thousands of words, in hope that my meager
    keyboard could replicate the intricacies of <i>The Trial of St-Orange</i>, the
    way gently chimed bells dance with electric static as faint memories of guitar
    melodies past linger over a background of found sound in ""A Glow in the Dark.""
    Or the way that very guitar part will keep repeating, adding a new nuance each go
    round until what was once a background element has taken the lead. To describe
    every subtle nuance on this album, every last unpredictable twist and turn of
    this music would be as impossible as it would be futile. This is the sort of
    music that defies description. Because even if you were to say that the Shalabi
    Effect fuses elements of Canada's burgeoning experimental electronics/musique
    concrète with psychedelic rock structure and North Indian harmonics, you'd still
    be failing to account for the ambient drones that layer so many moments or the
    tendency to place sparse AMM-style tinkering in the dark spots between would-be
    crescendos.</p><p>
    And I did say ""would-be.""  Much like that of fellow Montreal scenesters Godspeed
    You Black Emperor!, the Shalabi Effect's music is always building towards something.
    GYBE! takes the obvious way out, usually culminating in a grand cinematic blast.
    Like a Hollywood action movie, you enjoy it despite its predictability.  The
    Shalabi Effect, though, is the <i>Amelie</i> to Godspeed's <i>Lord of the Rings</i>,
    veering off on an unexpected path each time it reaches the finale.</p><p>
    Which is why I'm hoping you heeded my advice, why I'm hoping that if you've made
    it this far into the review, you've already heard <i>The Trial of St-Orange</i>.
    Because, much like an intercontinental cruise or (more likely, given the Pitchfork
    demographic) a good road trip with a few close friends in a rusty old Chrysler,
    the payoff here comes not in the arrival, but in the trip itself. A review of an
    action movie won't ruin anything, because anyone who's seen a couple of them is
    likely to predict the entire plot before the popcorn's gone. But the Shalabi
    Effect isn't just another rehashing of pop-culture cliches. They're as unpredictable
    and original as can be. And in today's lukewarm, microwavable, prepackaged culture,
    that's the biggest surprise of them all.</p></div>"|7089.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7089-the-trial-of-st-orange/|9.4|David M. Pecoraro

    actually heard the music they made. And this is one of the main reasons Rocket
    from the Tombs is one of the most mythologized bands ever.  Active for less than
    a year-- from winter 1974 to late summer '75-- RFTT released only one single
    during its brief lifespan, but its legacy was magnified by the two bands that
    sprung from its ashes: the scuzzy Dead Boys and arty, Beefheartian new wavers
    Pere Ubu.</p><p>
    
    Ubu's Dave Thomas (who performed under the name Crocus Behemoth) started the band,
    later adding future Dead Boys Gene O'Connor (aka Cheetah Chrome) and John Madansky
    (aka Johnny Blitz).  But the man most responsible for the band's mythic stature is
    Peter Laughner, a hard-living, Lou Reed-worshipping music journalist who wrote for
    the Lester Bangs-edited <i>Creem</i> magazine. He was also a promising songwriter
    (over the years his songs have been covered by Mission of Burma and Guns n' Roses,
    among many others) and a searing guitarist of Tom Verlaine-caliber. In fact, he
    was being groomed to replace Richard Lloyd in Television when he died of pancreatitis
    in 1977; years of constant drug abuse had simply worn out his body. And we all
    know what an untimely death means for an artist mythic stature, and as Laugher's
    rep grew so did that of RFTT. Of course, it didn't hurt that Pere Ubu released a
    series of excellent albums in the late seventies and early eighties.</p><p>
    
    A lot of the discussion surrounding RFTT focuses on their milieu. I wasn't there,
    so I can't say I have firsthand knowledge, but my impressions, based on what I've
    read and heard, is that Cleveland in 1974 was an industrial wasteland and a
    cultural desert, all mangled metal and shattered glass sprawled upon the rusty
    shores of a lake that was so polluted it periodically caught fire. Just ask anyone
    who was there at the time-- they're almost proud of how shitty it was. And Rocket
    from the Tombs perfectly embodied the bleakness of the city. Perhaps no other rock
    band has embodied (and thus, made commented upon) its surroundings better. It's
    something more akin to early 90s gansta rap than anything seen in rock.</p><p>
    
    Approaching the band from this viewpoint only deepens their myth.  But what about
    the actual music?  Does it measure up?  Is RFTT actually worth listening to?  Or
    are they just a band to be discussed, name dropped, and filed away?</p><p>
    
    This 19-song comp, <i>The Day the Earth Met the Rocket from the Tombs</i>, seeks
    to answer those questions by offering ""a tantalizing glimpse at one of the greatest
    albums never recorded,"" as the back cover puts it.  Nine of the songs are from
    home recorded demos, while the remaining ten are from two live dates; the sound
    quality, while nowhere near spectacular, is consistent and listenable.</p><p>
    
    The easiest way to describe RFTT's proto-punk is as a combination of the Stooges
    and Alice Cooper, with hints of Sabbath, the Velvet Underground, the Troggs, and
    Beefheart.  Altogether it's a jarring concoction.  Lyrically, they were easily the
    most nihilistic American band since the Stooges.  But RFTT's music is even more
    arresting than Iggy &amp; Co.'s in the sense that one can imagine doing something else
    while listening to it-- say, exercising or driving. But with RFTT, all you feel
    like doing is huddling up in the corner, or turning it off.  These are the only
    options this music offers.</p><p>
    
    This comp fittingly begins with a partial cover of the Stooges' ""Raw Power"" and
    ends with ""Search and Destroy."" In between, the band covers ""Satisfaction"" (almost
    beyond recognition) and the unreleased-at-the-time Velvet Underground song ""Foggy
    Notion."" All of which have their charms, but far better are the RFTT originals,
    many of which later wound up on Pere Ubu or Dead Boys albums (or both). There are
    nascent versions of the classics ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"" and ""Sonic Reducer""
    bearing witness to a great idiosyncratic songwriter (Thomas) coming into his own.</p><p>
    
    But the highlight of the album is Laughner's oft-covered ""Amphetamine"" (anyone
    familiar with Wilco's ""Misunderstood"" will immediately recognize the lyrics, which
    were respectfully lifted from this track nearly verbatim). This is the closest one
    can hope for in terms of a definitive recording of this mournful, yet unrelenting
    ballad.  Yes, a ballad.  These aren't all heavy punk songs.  In fact, in this one
    song, you can almost hear the entire career of Paul Westerberg being born.</p><p>
    
    But back to my earlier question: does the band's music live up to the lofty myth
    surrounding it?  One might as well ask if unrealized potential can substitute for
    actually delivering the goods.  The answer, friends, is no.</p><p>
    
    Had personality conflicts not ripped the band apart before it could capitalize on
    its members' talents, Rocket from the Tombs might have recorded a groundbreaking
    album.  But they didn't.  And so, all that's left are these fragments, left over
    from a by-gone era, and they can either be mourned over for what they're not, or
    enjoyed for what they are.  I'll choose the latter.</p></div>"|6814.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6814-the-day-the-earth-met-rocket-from-the-tombs/|7.4|Jason Nickey

    of Labtekwon's career.  ""Lab-tek-what?""  Yeah, he's definitely gone unnoticed in
    all but indie hip-hop circles, and he lets you know it more than once on these
    songs.  But he's not just another MC whining about his holy struggle in the
    underground.  His delivery's plainclothes at first, a sort of brown paper bag for
    all the identities kept inside-- amongst others, guru, prophet, griot, lover,
    philosopher and educator if you believe his boasts.  His diversity means you can't
    pin him down too easily, though that may be one factor in his lack of fame.</p><p>
    
    Of course, you might count ""the underground"" as just another crutch for those who
    lack skills, an excuse dressed up as treasure-filled crates.  Search for a second
    and you'll find those telltale glints of gold: you can always identify the
    underground in its opposition to the mainstream.  ""Culture"" weaves together
    positive and negative images of African-Americana, from b-ball and the mothers of
    mankind to prison and ""fornication on the frequent, regardless of consequence.""
    It's a solid cut, with an upbeat bass groove and piano-roll plinks, and Labtek
    flows playfully for the most part (""If you try to step you catch a Labteknical
    foul"").  But there's a hint of elder-statesmen-of-rap-style preaching, talking
    about living like savages and asking ""fifteen years from now, we still going to
    be doing the same rhyme flows from '86?""  I don't know, Lab, you wrote this in
    '94-- when you gonna stop with the Native Tongues licks from the early 90s?</p><p>
    
    That's the main problem across this retrospective; Labtekwon's beats are too
    simple.  Most tracks are built from hip-hop's barest bones, just a looped beat
    and a sample.  ""Speak on It"" is from 1996's <i>Da Helpless Won</i>, but the
    backing music sounds like a mixtape refugee from the early days of rap.  There's
    this canned horn vamp that seriously hits on every single beat.  It's unlistenable,
    too bad because lyrically Lab's on an African renaissance tip that would make
    Marcus Garvey proud.  ""I almost cried when I realized black tribes sold out to
    the merchant ships/ Black girls becomes guinea pigs for Norplant/ I'm tired of
    all of this, I begin the war chant.""  He spits, ""Ya god damn right I got a chip
    on my shoulder,"" but all I can think about is those horn bleats beating down on
    mine.  Then there's seven uninspired minutes of ""Perversion,"" which drips
    syrupy-smooth inflections over a funk-a-delic bassline.  No, baby, you ain't Dr.
    Funkenstein.  Take off those star-shaped shades and come on down from the
    Mothership.</p><p>
    
    So it comes down to the lyrics, and most of the time that's enough.  The man is
    intelligent and articulate, and though he rarely raises above spoken-word volume,
    he cuts off on the rhythm, then fires back, bobs and weaves whenever necessary
    and doesn't shy from twisted perspectives.  ""The Last Emcee,"" from the 2000 album
    of the same name, sketches out a picture in the third person, but you know who it
    refers to.  The stage is set in Baltimore, Labtekwon's hometown.  The plot: an
    MC's rise to fame.  Despite its lyrical conceits the song succeeds, pivoting on
    spacy synthwork and the discovery that the underground's just as filled with
    snakes as the mainstream.  1997's <i>Balti-Moorish Science</i> offers up
    ""Perspective,"" whose turntablist scratches don't distract from the cutting quality
    of the imagery: ""Embryo grows, rise out of the water/ Fluid pours from the comatose
    form between the thighs of a daughter/ Birth canal hurts now/ No money for Lamaze
    classes.""</p><p>
    
    There's a nice minimalism at work in the tracks at the middle of <i>Song of the
    Sovereign</i>.  Most date to the last few years, and share a jazzy Native Tongues
    flavor even if the mood isn't always light.  In an interview Labtekwon said that
    first and foremost he's always been a battle MC.  I don't hear that, and not just
    because there's too few guests on this sampler.  Labtek sounds most at home when
    he's on a mission, as on ""Darkside of the Sun"" from 1998's <i>Nile Child</i>.  On
    top of crackling vinyl and <i>Midnight Marauder</i> keyboards he narrates about
    sun tribes and pharaoh phonetics: ""Proverbial Frankenstein's monster/ From ancient
    times comes the conqueror/ Odyssey'in to my epic.""  On ""King of Kings,"" also from
    <i>Nile Child</i>, Labtek assumes an aggressive, raspy flow and the mantle of
    warrior king, dropping the gelatin/skin/skeleton rhyme before all his followers.</p><p>
    
    In his spare time Labtekwon tutors kids, and his storytelling skills come clear as
    his best gift.  His verses are studious, but most of the time not academic.
    Overall he's guilty of overconfidence, and singular vision is both his blessing
    and downfall.  He's got charm, from his Sun Ra-style ""I-wasn't-born-here"" personal
    mythology to a Nation of Gods and Earths-influenced promotion of his community.
    But it's hard to deny that Lab's beats are boring.  They're just too damn plain
    and retro.  Listen to each track over and over and you might start to love them,
    but trying to get excited about them is like raising morale in the terminal ward.
    I'm guessing that maybe an actual album might be a better starter.  Before Mush
    put together this retrospective, Labtek said a good introduction would be <i>Da
    Dawn, Volume 5</i> in his extensive self-released Labteknology series.  Anyways,
    check something because he's got his own unique science and it's worth it to
    watch it drop.</p></div>"|4619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4619-song-of-the-sovereign/|7.3|Christopher Dare
