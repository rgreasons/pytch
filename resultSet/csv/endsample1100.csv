    whether you can withstand a passionate and sustained
    conversation with a man talking directly into your
    ear. The placement of a dry, quietly sung vocal up
    front in a record's mix is invariably a gamble, or
    rather a hedge of one: Depending on the listener's
    mood, it may be read as DIY egalitarianism (reverb is,
    after all, an intimation of distance) or
    self-admiration. The Angels of Light records want you
    to feel the Booker's and bile on Michael Gira's
    breath; the French school currently embodied by, say,
    Keren Ann wants you to curl up in bed with every
    compressed sibilant and saliva snap. Doveman's Thomas
    Bartlett aims for neither grit nor seduction; he sings
    politely, quietly, in a halting high voice of a
    contrite ex-boyfriend mid-plea. A cynical first
    reaction would be ""emo"" or ""twee"" but, as Doveman's
    often fascinating debut progresses, Bartlett's
    complete lack of histrionics begins to register. He
    sounds hurt but never masochistic, dramatic but never
    vulgar; if this nice boy is <em>this</em> agitated, you
    begin thinking, something must really worry him. I
    better listen on.</p><p>
    
    What you will hear: songs that glisten and sway like
    underwater plantlife, delivered by a pleasantly
    bonkers ensemble (the banjo is the featured instrument
    almost throughout, supported by violin and Thomas's
    own accomplished piano and organ). The keys handle
    most of the low end as well; the drums, of course, use
    every available technique to avoid sounding ""rock""--
    brushes, muffled toms, weirdly distant cymbals. Live,
    Doveman's Dougie Bowne (a downtown legend who had
    drummed for Iggy Pop, among many others) plays a crash
    cymbal that had unpeeled into a long spiral.</p><p>
    
    The track names-- ""House"", ""Clouds"", ""Drinking"",
    ""Dancing""-- suggest that the songs may have spent some
    time untitled; the compositions themselves, however,
    are elegant, tasteful, top-notch. Aware that they
    are nearing the border between indie pop and cocktail
    jazz (a border it might, in fact, behoove the
    authorities to open), Doveman occasionally retreat
    into light skronk and dissonance. They can't help it:
    the skronk sounds decorative, dissonance pretty.</p><p>
    
    After the first two slow, mood-programming tracks,
    ""Cities"" takes the album's by now patented
    instrumentation and vocals on a swinging walk; the
    track is still leisurely by all human standards, but
    in the album's honey-drip universe, it's practically a
    club banger. The piano solo-- a pile-up of clashing
    ragtime licks reminiscent to my Russian ears of Sergei
    Kuryokhin-- is at once the song's apex and a
    tragicomic respite. The organ-driven ""Teacup"", which
    chastens Bowne's drums to approximate a cheap
    machine's plod and clop, swims with mysterious accents
    and mini-events, and wouldn't be out of place on a
    late-period Yo La Tengo LP. The album's undisputable
    tentpole, as evident from its length and strategic
    placement (on vinyl it would have been the Majestic
    Side One Closer) , is ""Boy + Angel"", which goes enough
    places to justify its eight minutes and wisely builds
    upon an urgent tom-tom throb to which one could listen
    for hours.</p><p>
    
    The songs' lyrics, which Bartlett appears to holds
    secondary to the meta-story of his own choked-up
    delivery, suddenly come into sharper relief toward the
    end of the album. ""Drinking"" cuts loose with a direct
    and rueful chorus about a self-destructive paramour;
    the closing track spins out a suddenly crisp ""The
    edges hold together/ The center falls flat/ I can't
    blame it on the weather/ My heart's not an acrobat""
    as things plink and groan and click and sigh toward
    oblivion. One wants to build a seedy yet expensive
    wine lounge somewhere in East Village just to be able
    to play this album around last call.</p></div>"|2617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2617-the-acrobat/|8.0|Michael Idov

It's an audacious claim, as the album is not ""lost"" and postdates the movie by more than thirty years. Instead, it's actually an homage to the scariest and most brutal 70s horror film, which was set in the fictional Muerto County, home of the most terrifying family in Texas (okay, the second most terrifying). No strangers to carnage (previous albums include <i>See You in Hell</i> and <em>Your Bloated Corpse Has Washed Ashore</em>), the Chicago-based duo of Tim Kelley and Christa Meyer were inspired by Tobe Hooper and Wayne Bell's atmospheric and often atonal noise soundtrack and the generic country tunes that eerily emanate from every radio frequency within county lines. Unlike that ""lost"" <i>Wizard of Oz soundtrack called <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em>, <em>Songs of Muerto County</em> is not meant to match up song for scene, but rather to evoke through music the creepy otherworldliness of the flat, hot Texas landscape, remote and craggy with cedar underbrush, and to create a macabre setting wherein a John Larroquette voiceover would not be out of place.</i></p><p>
    
    While the mission is different, the music and the Americana setting are similar to Pinetop Seven's reimaginings of silent films like <em>The Wind and </em><em>Laugh, Clown, Laugh</em>. If the source material is much more notorious, <em>Songs of Muerto County</em> transcends its audacious gimmick because Puerto Muerto are interested neither in retelling the story through song (<em>Alice's Chainsaw Massacree</em>, anyone?) nor in explaining away the horrors perpetrated in the film (one of the 2003 remake's many fatal flaws). Instead, Meyer and Kelley take inspiration from the incidental music and evoke that wide-open claustrophobia-- all that room to run, but nowhere to hide.</p><p>
    
    The first half of <em>Songs of Muerto County</em> sets up musical themes and tones that reappear throughout the album, suggesting that country music has the potential to be much creepier than the corporate metal that fills so many horror soundtracks. Over Kelley's dusty acoustic guitar melody, Meyer sings the introductory warnings of the lead-off track, ""Muerto County"", but mostly she relies on wordless aah-aah's, which subtly mimic a spooky pedal steel and imbue ""Ghostee"" and ""Walking"" with a nightfall dread. The second half of the album translates those melodies to more traditional settings, creating songs that have no narrative relation to <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> but would sound perfectly creepy crackling from the dash speakers of that soon-to-be-abandoned van or from a grimy gas station radio. ""What Have I Done?"" and ""Apple Pie"" are ramshackle C&amp;W; songs well suited to Kelley's unpretentious vocals. He plugs in his guitar for ""Cherries"" and ""Road Song"", whose relentless, percussive riff hammers home the song's cautionary lyrics. Aside from ""Walking"", which is interrupted halfway through by a violent burst of noise, these songs benefit from a lack of special effects, a no-budget aesthetic that informs the simplicity of Meyer's waltzing ""Wondering"" and the knife-sharp strums of closer ""Goodbye"".</p><p>
    
    There's a fine-line restraint to <em>Songs of Muerto County</em>: on one hand, Kelley and Meyer adhere to the traditional adage that a good soundtrack should not be more memorable than the film it supports. On the other, they aren't actually making a soundtrack, but a record that must stand on its own despite its inspiration. Occasionally, the album sounds too beholden to its source material-- music to dismember your victims by. At its best, however, <em>Songs of Muerto County</em> refrains from stating anything outright, the songs merely suggesting their emotional terrors and-- like the film-- leaving the hideous details to your imagination. </p></div>"|6580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6580-songs-of-muerto-county/|7.3|Stephen M.

    They've joined Louis XIV and The Bravery in 2005's fake-British-accent
    sweepstakes. Their lyrics are heavy on early-60s beat-fillers like
    ""well"", ""oh"", ""hey"", and ""alright"" [sic]. With so much twisting and
    shouting, the Redwalls sometimes come across like a bunch of teenagers
    from Chicago's North Shore taking a fateful day off. And with good
    reason: They started in 2001 as a British-rock cover band from a high
    school in Deerfield, Ill. On their second full-length (and major-label
    debut), they're more polished and they've stopped paying royalties,
    but not much else has changed.</p><p>
    Despite singer Logan Baren's intermittent Lennon impressions, Beatles
    comparisons give the Redwalls far too much credit. They more
    frequently appropriate from (and pale beside) their fellow
    appropriators. Opener ""Robinson Crusoe"" rides a riff borrowed from
    1971 smash ""Bang a Gong (Get It On)"" by infinitely superior
    fakebook-readers T. Rex, complete with horns-- a new addition on this
    sophomore effort. ""Back Together"" treads through sub-Oasis-isms--
    ""There's nothing you can say that isn't what you said""-- over a
    monotone guitar lick not far removed from the Guess Who's
    ""American Woman"". Even piano-based ""Build a
    Bridge"" is little more than a forgettable cover of Joe Cocker's
    Beatles-covering ""The Wonder Years"" theme.</p><p>
    The real groans come when the Redwalls get serious. ""What's this shit
    goin' down 'bout the FCC?"" asks Baren in full ""Gimme Some
    Truth""-Lennon mode on ""Falling Down"", before launching into a
    perfunctory chorus (""Darling, I've been falling down""). It's a good
    thing the Redwalls are defying the censors, or else society might go
    bereft of such controversial statements as ""Love is all around/ And
    it's for everyone"" from ballad ""How the Story Goes"", which sees Baren
    trying on Rod Stewart huskiness. Then there's ""Front
    Page"", which opens with newscast snippets about violence in Israel.
    This song desperately wishes it could be ""A Day in the Life"", but ""the
    world keeps turning around and around, yeah, around"", and turns out
    it's only ""Angel of Harlem""-grade Bono bluster. For finale ""Glory of
    War"", Baren dons the nasality of Bob Dylan or Barry McGuire and pens a
    generality-laden Vietnam War protest a few years too late. Somewhere,
    Karl Rove is smirking.</p><p>
    Influences are fine, gang. What makes <em>De Nova</em> so forgettable is
    not its traditionalism, but rather its clichés of thought and emotion,
    which betray a lack of creativity that extends beyond recycled
    melodies (though, yep, that's ""Green River"" in the verse of the
    inevitable ""It's Alright""). This is the type of band that would swipe
    the name of Brian Jacques' imaginative young-adult book series because
    a previous moniker, the Pages, was already claimed by pre-fame Mr.
    Mister. Sure, you can make some fine copies of copies these days, even
    decent copies of copies of copies, CTRL-C and CTRL-C and CTRL-C on
    down to hackneyed infinity. There's also shift-delete.</p></div>"|6935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6935-de-nova/|3.6|Marc Hogan

The long-form 
    remix finds one artist immersing himself completely in the work of 
    another, struggling to find a way to inject his own ideas in an attempt 
    to make something new, and it's fascinating to imagine someone-- whether it's Mad Professor sitting down with 
    Massive Attack's <em>Protection or Bill Laswell in a vault with five 
    years worth of electric Miles Davis jams-- surveying reels 
    of tape and dreaming of how it might all come together. </em></p><p>
    
    On <em>Surrounded By Silence, Prefuse 73 included a song called ""Pagina Dos"", on which he 
    further chopped the banjo and sampled voices of the Books, added 
    beats, and layered ethereal wordless vox on top. It was 
    one of the best tracks on the record, and now Herren follows by issuing this 
    22-minute EP-- eight tracks built on a foundation of Books material.</em></p><p>
    
    Prefuse and the Books are a good match. Herren's distinctive 
    drum programming is mid-tempo and open, allowing plenty of room for the Books' busier samples and strings to do their thing. The emotional approaches 
    overlap as well, as the Prefuse vibe has always contained a pastoral 
    tint, with Herren's interest in South American and Western European 
    folk 
    and pop seeping into the head-nodding hip-hop. The thoughtful and 
    studied tone of Prefuse fits snugly with Books' cleverness and whimsy.</p><p>
<em>Prefuse 73 Reads the Books</em> is most interesting when Herren plays a 
    shell 
    game with the source material, letting a familiar fragment of a Books 
    song poke out only to trim it back again with a series of sharp edits. 
    Two key bits are pulled from the title track to <em>The Lemon of Pink</em>. 
    ""Pagina Seis"" lets the unforgettable banjo/cello/voice sigh that opens 
    the Books' second record in for a few seconds and then pulls it away; the ensuing drum groove is warm and comforting, relaxed beats veined 
    with loops of guitar and banjo that are obviously Books but from no 
    song 
    in particular. The slow, lazy plucking that accompanies Ann Doerner on 
    the same Books original finds its way into both ""Pagina Dos"" and ""Pagina Ocho"". On the latter, Herren smashes the notes into 
    small 
    ringing clusters and uses the banjo as a contrast to an original ethereal vocal 
    from Claudia Deheza.</p><p>
    
    Nothing mind-blowing here, just an efficient EP filled with enjoyable 
    music. Since <em>The Books project is built on notions of appropriation and 
    recontextualization it's obviously malleable, and Herren's breezy trip 
    through the material feels like just another natural layer that could 
    lend itself to further tinkering. I doubt we've heard the last of this 
    collaboration.</em></p></div>"|6453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6453-reads-the-books-ep/|7.5|Mark Richardson

    Pipers face commercial disadvantages. Record buyers often prefer the face on
    the cover to the voice behind the mic, and who can blame 'em. Shit
    gets confusing, like when the Neptunes became N.E.R.D. and they were a
    band but they weren't a band and...? Waajeed's
    Slum Village roots may help, but, frankly, <em>Triple P</em> probably won't
    make good on the Pipers' metal-promising moniker.</p><p>
<em>Presents...</em>-style collections do have a leg up on their emcee-sponsored
    counterparts: stylistic coherence. (Hey, I care.) <i>Triple P</i> is no
    different. Each track is piloted by a gigantic, rushing thump. Sounds
    unremarkable, but continuity of beat is the first commandment of
    hip-hop production, and the hood is overrun by damn sinners. On top of
    this generous featherbed, PPP dump heaps of gooey, lounged-out
    instrumentation. One track has, like, eight electric pianos. Three
    more have seven. But ""Your Day Is Done"", which only brings five, is
    the no-brainer standout. The beat, to which Georgia lends serviceable
    belting and rapping, is definitive Detroit rushed snare, both smooth
    and skittish.</p><p>
    
    Yet for all the pleasant pastichery, many tracks get a strike for
    mediocre, half-assed, or annoying vocal performances. PPP are
    immodestly generous, doling out feature spots like it's their duty to
    God. When those spots are occupied by established talent, like Jay
    Dee, the results can be exhilarating. But most of the album's guests
    are yet-to-blow newbies, most of whom sound timorous. One passerby who
    could use <em>more</em> trepidation is Lacks, whose performance on ""The
    Pees"" is downright obnoxious. He flows like a slap bassist, performing
    exhausting rudiments in too-tight spaces with little grace and even
    less rhythm. Not sayin' it couldn't work, but the sassy Mr. Lacks does
    not jive with the Pipers' low-laying desert bar confections.</p><p>
    
    To PPP's credit, weak contributions from Sa-Ra Creative Partners,
    Tiombre Lockhart, and Zeno are redeemed by stellar beats. Dappled with
    streaks of astral synths, ""Deep Inside"" has a shy, backgrounded feel,
    which complements Sa-Ra's quiet, private-groovin' vox. ""I Got You""
    sounds like a civil union of Nicolay's Foreign Exchange project and
    Rich Harrison's fabulous ""1 Thing"" go-go beat: It throbs elegant
    brass and ivory under lo-fi saran, while a cacophonous ride bell tap
    dances in the back-background.</p><p>
    
    MC Invincible's appearance on ""Detroit Winter"" sums up the
    record's shortcomings: Her skills are undeniable, but girl needs to
    speak up. So, while I'm frustrated that <i>Triple P takes few risks and
    that its guest performers are so coweringly modest about their
    talents, Platinum Pied Pipers still get a pat on the back. And a
    motivational pep talk. And a goblet-full of sizzurp, because what the
    hell.</i></p></div>"|6579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6579-triple-p/|7.2|Sam Ubl

How does Jakob Dylan even get up in the morning knowing he's doomed to be judged against his father every time he writes a song or cuts a record? There are hundreds of children of musical giants roaming around the industry these days, working with varying degrees of success to carve out their own names separate from their parents-- Zak Starkey, the Lennon half-brothers, Moreno Veloso, Eric Mingus, and the various offspring of Charlie Haden, to name just a few. Femi Kuti is in this same position, perhaps dealing with an even more insurmountable legacy. As far as African music goes, his father Fela wasn't just Bob Dylan; to continue an imperfect analogy, he was also Bob Marley and John Coltrane, and that doesn't even take into account his political impact.</p><p>
    
    Femi of course is acutely aware of his father's towering legacy, and seems content to extend it, realizing that trying to equal it is impossible, regardless of genes. Femi had something of a head start, playing sax in his father's Egypt 80 bands for close to two decades, assuming leadership of it during his father's various politically motivated imprisonments. Though he had performed his own right for years, he only released his first solo album, <i>Shoki Shoki</i>, in 1998, a year after Fela's death from AIDS, in effect picking up the torch his father finally had to let fall. In the time since then he's recorded another album, contributed to records by Common (<em>Like Water for Chocolate) and Rachid Taha (<i>Made in Medina</i>), opened up the Afrika Shrine, a successor to his father's iconic Lagos nightclub, and founded an organization aimed at galvanizing and educating working-class Africans, all of this between multiple world tours.</em></p><p>
    
    So to say he's a busy, conscientious guy is something of an understatement. He may be the son of a legend, but Femi Kuti has paid his dues to arrive where he is, and now Wrasse Records has released this compilation of material drawn from his two studio albums as an introduction. Given that it's a 70-minute disc drawing from only two albums, you can imagine that it includes the bulk of both records and it does. Being familiar with both records, I really can't think of any of the usual wounded-critic objections to the track selection-- a better introduction to Femi's modern take on Afrobeat isn't in the offing.</p><p>
    
    While it's true that Femi basically plays modern Afrobeat, his approach differs quite a lot from his father's. Femi's songs tend to be much shorter, for one thing, with the focus more heavily on the dance elements of the music than the jazz elements. Femi's lyrics deal primarily with the present-tense problems of African societies, with a special emphasis on corruption, but unlike his father, he stays his tongue against ordinary Africans adopting Western ideals and specific entities like the Nigerian army. In other words, it's not as potent as Fela, but it's a fair bit more accessible, and anyone just looking for a nasty, horn-drenched groove to flip out to will find it here as well.</p><p>
    
    The five songs that open the disc hail from <i>Shoki Shoki, and the sound is bright and right up in your face. The groove of ""Truth Don Die"" is insane, and one of Femi's best horn themes stabs out over the top of it with slashing ferocity, while ""What Will Tomorrow Bring?"" slides by on a slower rhythm and allows Femi's vocal more room to show his range. ""Beng Beng Beng"" was a huge pan-African hit, and it's impossible not to see why: It's catchy as all get-out, and Femi's slippery vocal is one of his few to focus more on personal relationships (specifically, getting it on) than political realities.</i></p><p>
    
    The remaining tracks cover 2001's <em>Fight to Win</em>, with cameos from Mos Def and Common highlighting the far more politically charged and biting content of the songs. The arrangements are still hard and wickedly funky, but the band plays more loosely and explores more varied territory (to hear them really get into it, check out Live at the Shrine). ""'97"" directly addresses Fela's funeral and the death of Femi's sister Sola, with the band pulling back for a haunting breakdown where Femi calls out the poor medical care his sister received. ""Stop AIDS"" follows up on the theme with an impassioned plea for more attention to the disease that's eating Africa alive.</p><p>
    
    All told, it seems that Femi Kuti is doing fine working in his father's wake, carving out his own sound and finding his political footing in a changed Africa that still bears too many echoes of its past. His father's shadow will always remain-- that's just the reality of it-- but Femi is a worthy successor to that legacy.</p></div>"|4600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4600-the-best-of-femi-kuti/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    twists expectations even after repeated listens. For listeners who
    caught the disco stomp of the ""Giddy Up"" single from last year, you'll be
    surprised to hear such a downtempo record heavy with the influence of
    dub. For those tuning in to hear a modern dub album, close listening
    reveals that most of this is played live, with reverberating drums and
    echoing samples introduced at just the right moments, adding a cunning
    electronic sheen to what's essentially a live jazz record. Even in a
    post-rock, post-trip-hop, post-whatever world, Stromba have blurred the line
    between producer and musician in subtle and occasionally stunning ways,
    and written some cool tracks to boot.</p><p>
    
    The production team of James Dyer and Tom Tyler and their musical
    guests-- on trumpet, melodica, violin, other horns, and percussion--  are a
    detail-oriented bunch, crafting careful arrangements with small
    surprises in each. ""Swamp Donkey"" builds a slow-moving dervish out of African
    percussion before dropping off halfway into smooth wah-wah bass,
    kicking an extra bit of melody into their keen-eared cultural plundering.
    While ""Septic Skank"" and ""Manphibian"" are pure, creeping dub, the
    following ""Blue Skin"" starts with rollicking midtempo drums and trumpet over a
    watery drone, then introduces a pleading female vocal sample just
    before a steady bassline and distorted guitar, transforming dubby jazz into
    suspenseful soundtrack work. There's a few missteps, like the cloying
    nylon-string plucking of the closing track ""Jewell"", but it's the price paid for the diversity from track to track. It's a dabbler of a record, without the improvisation of jazz or the subtle shifts of techno, simply providing an assortment of great sounds. From the syncopated swing of ""Percolator"" to the horns that reach an
    atonal climax on ""Swings and Roundabouts"", <i>Sitting Room is a
    soundtrack waiting for a movie.</i></p><p>
    
    If anything, this record is a little too canny, robbing easy touchstones from the hippest genres. I envision Dyer and Tyler as two goatee-stroking trainspotters with
    swelled, distented craniums, able to assimilate incidental music from
    any source into a perfect pastiche. However, <em>Sitting Room</em>
    is grounded by their taste as producers and by the album's dogged
    restraint. Aside from the reappearance of ""Giddy Up"", it's consistently
    downtempo and even through its twists and turns holds a little something
    back, letting the listener fill in the blank.</p></div>"|7821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7821-tales-from-the-sitting-room/|7.7|Jason Crock

And in the opposing corner is Jon Langford, aka the Fanglord, aka the Mekons Menace, the Waco Brothers Brawler. It's a match made not in heaven, but in Sally Timms's Chicago apartment, where in 2002 Buckner and Langford recorded eight of the nine songs on this one-off collaboration album, released on Langford's Buried Treasure Records. The title suggests there may have been some friendly competition involved, which seems almost inevitable given their distinct styles. </em><em>Sir Dark Invader vs. the Fanglord pits Buckner's melting drawl against Langford's grainy vocals; Buckner's abstracted, introspective songwriting against Langford's demonstrative, outward-looking lyrics; Buckner's ragged beard against Langford's trimmed mustache. </em></p><p>
    
    This amiable musical friction enlivens every song: pounding drums and punchy basslines jab at welterweight guitar melodies, and over the melee, Buckner and Langford move easily between lead and backing vocals and trade off instruments and solos almost on a whim. As a result, songs like the opener ""The Rolling of the Eyes"" and ""The Inca Princess"" generate brawling momentum-- the kind seldom associated with Buckner's solo material-- while tracks like ""Nothing to Show"" and the closer ""Do You Wanna Go Somewhere?"" sound battered and worn, but not necessarily defeated.</p><p>
    
    The album is a volley of contradictions, a tossed-off collaboration (shelved for almost three years) that never sounds haphazard. The lighthearted aspects of the project-- songs like ""The Inca Princess"", the comic-book aliases, the photo-booth snapshots of both men that decorate the pixilated packaging-- disguise the gravity of the songs. ""Nothing to show for the things that I've done,"" Langford sings on the ruminative ""Nothing to Show"", ""There were places to go, and I had to choose this one."" Buckner takes over for the second verse, expressing an equally world-weary remorse. If they're pugilists on other songs, here they sound like hard-timers: singing ""We'll be lucky to leave/ Lucky to leave with our lives"", they sound like they're holding each other up, two drunks stumbling home from another long night at the bar. </p><p>
    
    This feeling bridges the two-minute intermission, ""From Attic to Basement"", and continues on the standout ""Torn Apart"" and the raucous ""Inca Princess"". The former's tense rhythms echo the restlessness of its lyrics, as Buckner and Langfird share a rueful back-and-forth, singing the title over and over as the song winds down. ""The Inca Princess"" kicks up a barnstorming momentum as Langford describes a bar so tough that ""drinkin' and drivin' was almost mandat'ry.""</p><p>
    
    By contrast, the conflicted lullaby ""No Tears Tonight"" and the abruptly abandoned ""Do You Wanna Go Somewhere?"" parse the isolation and the inspiration of a life devoted to music. ""I wanna wrap you up in music,"" Langford sings, then admits, ""But we both know that I got nothing/ Spent too much time playing in bands."" Taken together, these two tracks comprise a twist ending of sorts, revealing that Sir Dark Invader and the Fanglord have been fighting on the same side all along, battling the spectre of loneliness. The mix of celebration and commiseration on the album suggests a draw.</p></div>"|1001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1001-sir-dark-invader-vs-the-fanglord/|7.4|Stephen M. Deusner

The first occurs at about 40 seconds into ""Chain Reaction"" when the 4/4 stomp of Jaki Liebezeit's drums line up with Holger Czukay's bass pulse, alongside tambourine and percolating drum machine; I realize that this song is closer to trance techno than the minimalist funk or psychedelic motorik of the band's earlier records. In fact, the first time I ever heard ""Chain Reaction"", I was mostly unfamiliar with trance, and wondered if Can had actually invented the music. I'd never read anything to that effect, but it seemed obvious they must have had at least a hand in its creation. In any case, the only music I've heard since that approached their primal, impressionistic romp has been by bonafide dancefloor shamans like the Orb or Orbital, or even Aphex Twin's ambient stuff. Of course, I loved Can a lot more: They seemed subtler and messier, like Claude Debussy's ghost tripping over a Mayan ruin mid-thought.</p>
<p>The second miracle occurs at the 6:28 mark in ""Chain Reaction"", when the swirling mass of synth and Michael Karoli's brain-fried guitar solo is brutally interrupted by a chime and black void of metallic, echo-chamber ambience. The beat stays intact (Liebezeit couldn't stop playing that pulse on a bet), but the mood goes from proto-jam-band orgasm to stark ambience with drums of death. Had Terry Riley not nabbed the Phantom Band moniker for one of his records, Can could have stolen it here-- and Liebezeit did for one of his solo projects in the 1980s! Unlike virtually any other band on the planet, Can were able to straddle the line between primal and progressive, popular and avant-garde in a way that made both extremes seem like the best possible end for Western music.</p>
<p>The third occurs five-and-a-half minutes into ""Quantum Physics"", when Irmin Schmidt's Alpha 77 synth cluster chord suddenly becomes a fully-fledged major one. By this point in the song, the raging, percussive momentum of the previous track has almost completely evaporated into only the hint of a beat, as if the spirit of the piece had long since been shot out into space, left to dissolve into what popular physics author Nick Herbert once described as ""quantumstuff""-- the one true matter of the universe, of which we and everything we see or feel is made. Schmidt lets his tones sustain, and I can hear the overtones forming, one by one, until the chord is more than just major. In fact, the physics of sound dictate that if you let a note ring long enough, you'll get the minor-7th harmonic, and eventually a 9th-- exactly the notes old Debussy liked to insert into chords to make them all pagan and erotic.</p>
<p>The last miracle occurs as the song is fading away from us entirely, when even Liebezeit's drums have dried up and the only discernable sound comes from Schmidt's endlessly spiraling synthesizer overtones. Mid-period Can is arguably the band's most interesting because it witnesses them having to explore more than just the backbeat of experimental rock, more than just the ambience of the space music they helped create. ""Quantum Physics"" is what happens when discipline and intelligence rams head on with divine inspiration. It is understated and refined, but glowing with life. It's not the kind of song you put on to start a party, but if you want to send a few of your best friends home like angels, you'll put it on at the end. It sounds like the music of the spheres to me.</p>
<p>Can had approached this territory before with 1973's <i>Future Days</i>. After the band's modest success with the ""Spoon"" in 1972 (buoyed by its use as the theme to a popular German gangster show), they were able to afford a short summer holiday. When they came back to record, it was a collective idyllic, sunshiny aura that most informed their efforts. The title track, fading in on the back of seaside ambience and distant accordion, was Can's smoothest production yet, sounding either like they'd successfully amputated the pulse and precision of <i>Ege Bamyasi</i>, added a lush veneer and forged a new kind of pop music, or somehow invented the greatest tropicalia known to man. Damo Suzuki's cooing (""You hide behind a borrowed chase / For the sake of <i>Future Days</i>"") never sounded so alluring, and Can's music had never seemed as sensuous or divorced from gravity. Likewise, the epic ""Bel Air"" featured Can at their most impressionistic, if not always focused. Czukay once described his band as an ""electric symphony group"", and the heavily edited and structured ""Bel Air"" betrays a dedication to long-form statements and an almost painterly sense of blended colors and landscapes.</p>
<p>Following <i>Future Days</i>, Suzuki got married to a Jehovah's Witness and left the band. After trying out several singers, Can eventually decided to keep things to themselves for <i>Soon Over Babaluma</i>, as Karoli took over vocals in most cases, with Schmidt helping from time to time. Due to circumstances, the record sounds obviously transitional, and was in fact the last one Can would complete using their tried and true straight-to-stereo method, before upgrading to more modern, multi-track methods afterwards. However, even beyond the aforementioned ""Chain Reaction""/""Quantum Physics"" highlight, it's a good record. ""Dizzy Dizzy"" is something like Can's version of ska (kraut-skank?), and features the first of several future Karoli forays using violin, on which he's surprisingly competent. His refrain of ""got to get it up, got to get it over"" serves the insistent, space-bounce of the track, and though the band would misstep on world music attempts in later years, this was pretty interesting. The murky electro-bossa ""Come sta, La Luna"" is also cool, featuring Schmidt's vocals and ominous piano lines. Only ""Splash"" leaves me underwhelmed, seeming tired and directionless in comparison to the rest of the record.</p>
<p><i>Unlimited Edition</i> is the CD expansion of the <i>Limited Edition LP, featuring various unreleased tracks from 1968 to 1974, all recorded in Can's private Inner Space studios. Given the nature of the collection, a general lack of cohesion is to be expected, but for my money, </i><i>Unlimited Edition</i> is one of the most underrated items in the band's catalog. From the heavenly climates of ""Gomorrha"" and ""Ibis"", to the more cutting, rock-edged tracks with Malcolm Mooney (""The Empress and the Ukraine King"", ""Mother Upduff"", ""Connection"", ""Fall of Another Year""-- all of which could have comprised a classic EP) to the sometimes bizarre, sometimes funny ""Ethnological Forgery Series"", wherein Can raid the world's various indigenous music and make stuff that would make both Steve Reich and Boredoms proud. And of course there's ""Cutaway"": an epic, spliced-together piece that might sound more at home on a Faust record than here.</p>
<p>1975's <i>Landed</i> was the first Can record to get what Czukay describes as a ""professional mix"", as the band upgraded to 16 tracks and had the opportunity to bring out many more layers of sound. However, what might have sounded like a godsend to fans craving as much Can magic as they could get didn't quite turn out as we expected. Gone were the epic, funky ambient songs or minimalist rock experiments in favor of some pretty straightforward jam-band tunes. ""Full Moon on the Highway"" bursts out of the gate with a deft pace and Karoli's thin, decidedly non-rock chipmunk chorus. Luckily, his guitar is front and center, though it was clear the band weren't playing space age physics music anymore. ""Half Past One"", ""Vernal Equinox"" and ""Hunters and Collectors"" are variations on the idea of bare-basic chord progression and high-speed beats serving as launching pads for lengthy solos. I give Can credit for having the chops to pull it off, but did I really need to hear them do it? ""Red Hot Indians"" is more interesting, sounding like bizarre tropical jazz-pop, and featuring Olaf Kübler from Amon Düül guesting on dual sax solos. The 13-minute sound-art closer ""Unfinished"" doesn't really fit with the rest of the record, but does at least give Can the chance to stretch out their most experimental ideas into 16 tracks, and is reminiscent of ""Cutaway"" or some of the more out-there moments on <i>Tago Mago</i>.</p>
<p>Like the previous Mute remasters, these albums now sound incredible. Listening to ""Chain Reaction"", ""Gomorrha"", and ""<i>Future Days</i>"", I was constantly surprised at how clear everything sounded, as if the band had recorded all of this stuff in one fell swoop during an unbelievably inspired, marathon session. One of the great things about Can, even in their off moments, was the attention to detail and realization that the affect of each tiny moment in the course of a song can affect the momentum of the entire piece. No small miracles here: even if it's sad to think these albums represent Can's last great gasp, none of their moments have ever sounded better.</p></div>"|11699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11699-future-days-soon-over-babaluma-unlimited-edition-landed/|8.8|Dominique Leone

""Full Moon on the Highway"" bursts out of the gate with a deft pace and Karoli's thin, decidedly non-rock chipmunk chorus. Luckily, his guitar is front and center, though it was clear the band weren't playing space age physics music anymore. ""Half Past One"", ""Vernal Equinox"" and ""Hunters and Collectors"" are variations on the idea of bare-basic chord progression and high-speed beats serving as launching pads for lengthy solos. I give Can credit for having the chops to pull it off, but did I really need to hear them do it? ""Red Hot Indians"" is more interesting, sounding like bizarre tropical jazz-pop, and featuring Olaf Kübler from Amon Düül guesting on dual sax solos. The 13-minute sound-art closer ""Unfinished"" doesn't really fit with the rest of the record, but does at least give Can the chance to stretch out their most experimental ideas into 16 tracks, and is reminiscent of ""Cutaway"" or some of the more out-there moments on <i>Tago Mago</i>.</p>
<p>Like the previous Mute remasters, these albums now sound incredible. Listening to ""Chain Reaction"", ""Gomorrha"", and ""<i>Future Days</i>"", I was constantly surprised at how clear everything sounded, as if the band had recorded all of this stuff in one fell swoop during an unbelievably inspired, marathon session. One of the great things about Can, even in their off moments, was the attention to detail and realization that the affect of each tiny moment in the course of a song can affect the momentum of the entire piece. No small miracles here: even if it's sad to think these albums represent Can's last great gasp, none of their moments have ever sounded better.</p></div>"|11699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11699-future-days-soon-over-babaluma-unlimited-edition-landed/|7.9|Dominique Leone

The first occurs at about 40 seconds into ""Chain Reaction"" when the 4/4 stomp of Jaki Liebezeit's drums line up with Holger Czukay's bass pulse, alongside tambourine and percolating drum machine; I realize that this song is closer to trance techno than the minimalist funk or psychedelic motorik of the band's earlier records. In fact, the first time I ever heard ""Chain Reaction"", I was mostly unfamiliar with trance, and wondered if Can had actually invented the music. I'd never read anything to that effect, but it seemed obvious they must have had at least a hand in its creation. In any case, the only music I've heard since that approached their primal, impressionistic romp has been by bonafide dancefloor shamans like the Orb or Orbital, or even Aphex Twin's ambient stuff. Of course, I loved Can a lot more: They seemed subtler and messier, like Claude Debussy's ghost tripping over a Mayan ruin mid-thought.</p>
<p>The second miracle occurs at the 6:28 mark in ""Chain Reaction"", when the swirling mass of synth and Michael Karoli's brain-fried guitar solo is brutally interrupted by a chime and black void of metallic, echo-chamber ambience. The beat stays intact (Liebezeit couldn't stop playing that pulse on a bet), but the mood goes from proto-jam-band orgasm to stark ambience with drums of death. Had Terry Riley not nabbed the Phantom Band moniker for one of his records, Can could have stolen it here-- and Liebezeit did for one of his solo projects in the 1980s! Unlike virtually any other band on the planet, Can were able to straddle the line between primal and progressive, popular and avant-garde in a way that made both extremes seem like the best possible end for Western music.</p>
<p>The third occurs five-and-a-half minutes into ""Quantum Physics"", when Irmin Schmidt's Alpha 77 synth cluster chord suddenly becomes a fully-fledged major one. By this point in the song, the raging, percussive momentum of the previous track has almost completely evaporated into only the hint of a beat, as if the spirit of the piece had long since been shot out into space, left to dissolve into what popular physics author Nick Herbert once described as ""quantumstuff""-- the one true matter of the universe, of which we and everything we see or feel is made. Schmidt lets his tones sustain, and I can hear the overtones forming, one by one, until the chord is more than just major. In fact, the physics of sound dictate that if you let a note ring long enough, you'll get the minor-7th harmonic, and eventually a 9th-- exactly the notes old Debussy liked to insert into chords to make them all pagan and erotic.</p>
<p>The last miracle occurs as the song is fading away from us entirely, when even Liebezeit's drums have dried up and the only discernable sound comes from Schmidt's endlessly spiraling synthesizer overtones. Mid-period Can is arguably the band's most interesting because it witnesses them having to explore more than just the backbeat of experimental rock, more than just the ambience of the space music they helped create. ""Quantum Physics"" is what happens when discipline and intelligence rams head on with divine inspiration. It is understated and refined, but glowing with life. It's not the kind of song you put on to start a party, but if you want to send a few of your best friends home like angels, you'll put it on at the end. It sounds like the music of the spheres to me.</p>
<p>Can had approached this territory before with 1973's <i>Future Days</i>. After the band's modest success with the ""Spoon"" in 1972 (buoyed by its use as the theme to a popular German gangster show), they were able to afford a short summer holiday. When they came back to record, it was a collective idyllic, sunshiny aura that most informed their efforts. The title track, fading in on the back of seaside ambience and distant accordion, was Can's smoothest production yet, sounding either like they'd successfully amputated the pulse and precision of <i>Ege Bamyasi</i>, added a lush veneer and forged a new kind of pop music, or somehow invented the greatest tropicalia known to man. Damo Suzuki's cooing (""You hide behind a borrowed chase / For the sake of <i>Future Days</i>"") never sounded so alluring, and Can's music had never seemed as sensuous or divorced from gravity. Likewise, the epic ""Bel Air"" featured Can at their most impressionistic, if not always focused. Czukay once described his band as an ""electric symphony group"", and the heavily edited and structured ""Bel Air"" betrays a dedication to long-form statements and an almost painterly sense of blended colors and landscapes.</p>
<p>Following <i>Future Days</i>, Suzuki got married to a Jehovah's Witness and left the band. After trying out several singers, Can eventually decided to keep things to themselves for <i>Soon Over Babaluma</i>, as Karoli took over vocals in most cases, with Schmidt helping from time to time. Due to circumstances, the record sounds obviously transitional, and was in fact the last one Can would complete using their tried and true straight-to-stereo method, before upgrading to more modern, multi-track methods afterwards. However, even beyond the aforementioned ""Chain Reaction""/""Quantum Physics"" highlight, it's a good record. ""Dizzy Dizzy"" is something like Can's version of ska (kraut-skank?), and features the first of several future Karoli forays using violin, on which he's surprisingly competent. His refrain of ""got to get it up, got to get it over"" serves the insistent, space-bounce of the track, and though the band would misstep on world music attempts in later years, this was pretty interesting. The murky electro-bossa ""Come sta, La Luna"" is also cool, featuring Schmidt's vocals and ominous piano lines. Only ""Splash"" leaves me underwhelmed, seeming tired and directionless in comparison to the rest of the record.</p>
<p><i>Unlimited Edition</i> is the CD expansion of the <i>Limited Edition LP, featuring various unreleased tracks from 1968 to 1974, all recorded in Can's private Inner Space studios. Given the nature of the collection, a general lack of cohesion is to be expected, but for my money, </i><i>Unlimited Edition</i> is one of the most underrated items in the band's catalog. From the heavenly climates of ""Gomorrha"" and ""Ibis"", to the more cutting, rock-edged tracks with Malcolm Mooney (""The Empress and the Ukraine King"", ""Mother Upduff"", ""Connection"", ""Fall of Another Year""-- all of which could have comprised a classic EP) to the sometimes bizarre, sometimes funny ""Ethnological Forgery Series"", wherein Can raid the world's various indigenous music and make stuff that would make both Steve Reich and Boredoms proud. And of course there's ""Cutaway"": an epic, spliced-together piece that might sound more at home on a Faust record than here.</p>
<p>1975's <i>Landed</i> was the first Can record to get what Czukay describes as a ""professional mix"", as the band upgraded to 16 tracks and had the opportunity to bring out many more layers of sound. However, what might have sounded like a godsend to fans craving as much Can magic as they could get didn't quite turn out as we expected. Gone were the epic, funky ambient songs or minimalist rock experiments in favor of some pretty straightforward jam-band tunes. ""Full Moon on the Highway"" bursts out of the gate with a deft pace and Karoli's thin, decidedly non-rock chipmunk chorus. Luckily, his guitar is front and center, though it was clear the band weren't playing space age physics music anymore.

The enormous Houston MC relies almost entirely on the intertwined lyrical themes of I'm Awesome and I'm Rich, sometimes dipping into I'll Kill You or I Don't Care About Women. But that's OK-- the anticipation surrounding <i>Already Platinum</i>, Slim's debut album, has nothing to do with the man's lyrical prowess. It has everything to do with his voice: a swollen, slurry, guttural drawl that rumbles under tracks like an earthquake and hammers vowels until any one word can rhyme with any other word. It's all hard consonants and long, luxurious vowels; he says ""ball till we fall"" like ""bowel till we fowl."" When DJs slow Slim's voice down, it barely sounds any different.</p><p>
    
    Slim has bragged for years that he'd probably never record a solo album, just because no label could offer him the kind of money he made pushing mixtapes on Houston's independent circuit. ""Labels musta got tires of hearing me say 'fuck a deal'/ Cuz they put something in my pocket made a nigga chill,"" Slim raps on the intro to <em>Already Platinum. But when Slim signed to Geffen, the label matched him up with the resurgent superproducers the Neptunes, and it didn't seem like a good match. The Neps have had a few monster hits in the past year (""Hollaback Girl"", ""Drop It Like It's Hot""), but most of their tracks have lost the gleaming, clattering swagger they once had, relying instead on bloodless synth lines and itchy, nattering drums. On ""Like a Boss"" and ""I Ain't Heard of That"", the first leaked Neptunes/Slim Thug collaborations, Slim's flow sounded awkwardly shoehorned into the cold, brittle tracks, allowing the rapper none of the breathing room that he'd had on the slow, gooey Houston funk tracks that had been his bread and butter.</em></p><p>
    
    And parts of <i>Already Platinum have no chemistry whatsoever. ""This Is My Life"", the Neptunes' attempt at greasy Houston funk, is tinny and overproduced, while ""Ashy to Classy"" is the Neps' attempt to jack Biggie's ""Juicy"", the pillowy quiet-storm guitars and inspirational lyrics dispassionately falling short on every possible level. The shockingly limp love-jam ""Miss Mary,"" produced by Cool &amp; Dre, is even worse; nobody wants to hear Slim Thug saying ""To my nose, you're smelling just as sweet as a rose/ I wasn't impressed with them others, so you the one I chose"".</i></p><p>
    
    But elsewhere on the album, Slim hits his stride. If his chemistry with the Neptunes seemed shaky at first, it comes together beautifully on dipping, floating hypnotic strut of ""Click Clack"" and the lighter-than-air gliding pianos and typewriter percussion of the title track, complete with a surprisingly non-shitty guest verse from Pharrell. Slim also shows impressive versatility on his work with other producers, murdering a gloomy, cinematic Sha Money XL beat on ""The Interview"" and a rippling, summery Jazze Pha beach-funk track on ""Incredible Feelin'"".</p><p>
    
    But Slim still sounds best on tracks like ""Diamonds"" and the mixtape banger ""3 Kings"", both from Houston producer Mr. Lee. These tracks are classic Houston screw-- they sound like mid-90s G-Funk played on fucked-up, broken car stereos with the bass jacked up to seismic levels, the hooks coming out sick and damaged and wrong, slow and heavy drums slamming through the murk. Slim sounds perfectly at home on these tracks, making room for a jaw-dropping virtuoso Bun B guest spot, threatening crosstown rival Lil Flip, and smothering the tracks his creeping bottomless depth-charge snarl. On tracks like this, Slim sounds prehistoric, like he's always existed, like this voice has been echoing over canyons and through caves since before time began. </p></div>"|7820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7820-already-platinum/|7.5|Tom Breihan

This Norwegian duo's first album, <em>Melody A.M.</em>, was absolutely impeccable, sure-- all swishy drum shuffle, downtempo head-nod, and endless attention to detail. But it still felt like they were holding something back, proofreading every snare crack but keeping the big ideas in their pockets. This time around, incredibly, they've gone all free rein on the extra-deep epics they used to save for remixes of other people's pop tracks. This time around, it's shades of MRI's dark sparkle, Luomo's non-stop depth, and the same maximalist guest-vocaled dance-pop extravagance on Basement Jaxx's <em>Kish Kash</em>.</p><p>
    Except where the Jaxx go for jerky funk and sample kung-fu, Röyksopp enjoy long, silky builds suitable late-night highway cruising, anyplace dim and wide and beautiful. (This, after all, sounds suspiciously like a break-up album, and one that finishes off with more than minutes of Eno-ambient.) Jaxx will go overboard with the bells and whistles and constant motion, until three minutes' listening leaves you kind of drained; when <em>The Understanding</em> does the same thing, it's by way of luscious synth pads swelling gradually out to fill every millimeter of studio space. Some of this album's best moments have a keyboard-aquarium ambition that rivals anything from the early-80s charts, and if you've ever noticed how much the Knife's Karin Dreijer sounds like Cyndi Lauper, you'll get actual ""Time After Time"" flashbacks from her fabulous guest spot on ""What Else Is There?""</p><p>
    So it gets lush, especially with the boys getting heavy on the songwriting and the singing. (Turns out Erlend Øye <em>doesn't</em> have an interesting voice-- every boy in Bergen sounds like that.) Come at it the wrong way, and ""Only This Moment"", the single, can feel like a pile of frosting with only a cupcake inside. Hit it right, though, and it's astral, a subliminal trance anthem with perfect vocal splashes by Kate Havnevik (in reality) and arrangements by Mark Knopfler (in my head). ""Circuit Breaker"" is a little more straightforward, crooning its way up to that throbbing, running-in-place Röyksopp club-track peak. It's the tail end that really thrills, with Havnevik cooing like Alison Goldfrapp used to do for Orbital, and some acid synth scribbling it all out to the euphoric sunrise.
    </p><p>
    Because of <em>course</em> they're great at this: Give these guys some trebly vintage drum samples and a dreamy vocal and they're all set to make it swish and kick. Personal-favorite ""49 Percent"" rides those trademark Röyksopp ""breaks"" tick-tocking under a two-note soul vocal from Get Physical's Chelonis R. Jones, straight up into some tense, free-floating territory; these guys have a gift for holding a track right at that beautiful, pulsing point where it's about to break loose but can't, and there's no better place for a good singer to hang out and swoon. It doesn't hurt that the flat tick-tock edges so seamlessly up into its chord patterns, Exhibit Z that Röyksopp are just plain good technicians with this stuff.
    </p>
<p>
    The vocal-free tracks scattered through here are as much of a change from the sun on the last album: It's ""Röyksopp's Night Out"" stuff, sometimes even deeper and lost-in-spacier than the vocal spots. ""Alpha Male"" kicks a few of this year's rock moves, but it can't help making them rush instead of stomp. A couple of slow-funk touches give you a foothold on the earth (see ""Someone Like Me""), but the vibe can still come close to the Marianna Trench pumped full of meringue. Don't worry too much if the first headphone listen puts you to sleep: That's just your ears overloading and your brain drowning, happily and temporarily.
    </p>
<p>
    The best part is that this album has Röyksopp being a lot more Röyksopp than the last one. If bits of <em>Melody A.M.</em> had them sounding all masterful and immaculate but not <em>entirely</em> league-of-their-own, this one does a lot to correct that. Meaning this is the one that puts them firmly and officially up there in the top tier of the dance-music crossover-album crowd, up with the Daft Punks and, umm, Basement Jaxxes. Really: Good for them.

    EP 
    that found leader Glen Johnson setting his songs in front of a 
    completely electronic backdrop. Following that fruitful experiment 
    Piano 
    Magic return with <em>Disaffected</em>, an overwhelmingly song-oriented record 
    built mostly around typical rock band instrumentation. And it's a good 
    one-- perhaps Piano Magic's strongest full length since <em>Low Birth 
    Weight</em>.</p><p>
    Glen Johnson's always-meticulous attention to sonic detail this time 
    focuses on the emotional possibilities of guitar tone. The snarling leads in ""You Can Hear the Room"" allude to that point when 
    the gauzy beauty of shoegaze meets the drop-D heft of grunge, and 
    though 
    the lyrics talk about ""the whisper of the pipes"" this is one of the 
    loudest songs Piano Magic has recorded. Another massive guitar swell 
    closes ""Love &amp; Music"", reflecting the song's simple theme (""love and 
    music 'til I die"") with a sexy wall of trebly chords. Much is made of 
    the influence of the 4AD and Factory labels on Piano Magic, and it's 
    hard to hear the evocative echo-chamber tone of ""Night of the Hunter"" 
    as 
    anything but channeled Duritti Column. On the simple ballad ""I Must 
    Leave London"" Johnson's acoustic is wet and lush as Hyde Park grass in 
    a 
    November drizzle.</p><p>
<em>Disaffected</em> can fairly be called a rock album, but two of the most 
    interesting songs depart from the template. The title track is the only 
    song with female vox, sung this time by Angèle David-Gillou, and 
    through 
    its main section it weds acoustic guitars to a simple drum machine 
    beat. 
    The four-minute coda, however, allows the electronic percussion to take 
    the lead, as beats grow progressively syncopated and the rest of the 
    music drops out save an occasional vocal sample. Even dancier is 
    ""Deleted Scenes"", which appears halfway through and is then reprised as 
    the record's final track in an extended remix. Possibly <em>Disaffected</em>'s 
    best song, ""Deleted Scenes"" is icy new wave with a classicist's 
    reverence for the feel and clarity of the early 80s originals, from 
    Johnson's Bernard Sumner croon to the primitive synths and cheesy (but 
    effective) vocodered chorus refrain. The extended mix is the one to 
    listen for, with a funky electronic drum jam dominating the final three 
    minutes that playfully shuffles the sort of quasi-industrial percussion 
    hits Depeche Mode used in ""People are People"".</p><p>
    Interesting thing about Piano Magic is that while the band's overall 
    aesthetic-- music, lyrics and visual presentation-- is so well defined 
    and consistent, the actual records are all over the place. We know 
    we're 
    going to get sad introspection, that the songs will take place in 
    winter, that the production will somehow bring to mind the word 
    ""ethereal,"" and the packaging will look good. The details, however, are 
    always up in the air, which possibly explains the band's inconsistency. 
    This time out the pieces land in a satisfying place.</p></div>"|6287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6287-disaffected/|7.6|Mark Richardson

    beatkeeping gig with daylight-beamin' Glaswegian melody-worshipers
    Teenage Fanclub. On his the Primary 5 debut, <i>North Pole, he also aims to created dangerously infectious meadow-pop. Here Quinn, with help from multi-instrumentalist Ryan Currie, among others, lays on more
    blue-sky lovey-dove on the warm-not-Arctic <em>North
    Pole</em>. The Primary 5's sound, like the Fannies', is-- to keep it proper and indie-- Big Star, Sloan, the Raspberries. But more accurately, it's practically Gin
    Blossom-y (albeit through the Clientele's classicist gauze). And that's not just because brilliant opener ""Comin' Home"" mentions
    ""gin"" and ""blossoms"" before announcing, plaintively but seeping with
    driblets of molten joy, ""I only want you here by my side.""</i></p><p>
    OK, so maybe ""honey you make me feel so good
    you're the girl I've waited for my whole life through you're the one""
    on finale ""Field of Dreams"" breaches my Green Bay-hat threshold. Banal
    lyrics bug me, no foolin'. Similarly, penultimate hymn ""Shine On"" is
    too Pure Prairie League for taste. But throughout the rest of <em>North
    Pole</em>, Quinn's songwriting is unpretentiously immaculate, rivaling
    ageless ingénue Jonathan Richman in the ability to confect
    near-perfect pop from deceptively facile-seeming bubblegum base and
    sporkfuls of sugar.</p><p>
    On ""I'll Lay You Down"", laden with woodsy CSNY harmonies, the refrain
    ""I'll lay you down before you fall"" may just be a (more?) poetic way
    to say ""I'll never let your head hit the bed/ Without my hand behind
    it"". But I'm ready to tell Quinn I'm free Friday night and open to
    going pillow-shopping. ""Everybody Knows It Hurts"" has the graceful
    maturity of Lou Barlow's <em>Emoh</em>, ""Without You"" has killer
    Byrdsian riffs and crushingly childlike adoration, and ""What Am I
    Supposed to Do"" converses like real-life flirting partners given the
    benefit of dizzying pop hook-smithing. On ""Happy"", Quinn exclaims
    (happily): ""When the sun comes up it makes me happy/ When the sun
    goes down it makes me blue/ But when the stars shine bright and light
    up the night/ ...You know that makes me happy too."" Straight-lined.
    More elegant than it looks.</p></div>"|6578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6578-north-pole/|7.2|Marc Hogan

    indie rock that occurred in the early '00s is the
    notion that lo-fi is an illegitimate tool, the go-to
    cover-up for artists short on cash, patience, and
    ideas. It's an understandable aversion, given the
    long trail of refuse left in the wake of <em>Slanted &amp;
    Enchanted and </em><em>Bee Thousand</em>; bands
    seemed to think a respectable career could be bought
    with a four-track and a whole lotta reverb. But it's
    also easy to forget what an effective tool the
    home-studio process can be when used properly-- creating unexpected, unique sounds and enveloping the
    music in an intimate blanket.</p><p>
    
    Spencer Krug's project under the name Sunset Rubdown
    seems to be aware of the tightrope that needs to be
    walked with lo-fi production, but he can't
    help ending up on the wrong side more often than not.
    Krug can be found spending his days with animal-themed
    acts Frog Eyes and Wolf Parade, but saves his nights
    for recording sparse, echo-dipped ballads for this
    moniker, at least one of which has already been
    recycled for one of his other bands' more-fidelitous
    recordings. <em>Snake's Got a Leg</em> therefore seems a
    little bit like a solo project, a little bit like
    demos, and the music contained within is similarly
    torn between fully realized and undercooked.</p><p>
    
    The elements Krug makes most prominent in his bedroom
    studio are his own pinched, Bowie-esque voice and a
    variety of keyboards, both outlined in a thick border
    of fuzz by heaping helpings of reverb. The echobox
    treatment does a good job of filling in the gaps left
    by the spare arrangements, and gives what are
    presumably rather normal instruments an
    extraterrestrial flair, as with the organ or Rhodes or
    Two-buck Casio that ""I'll Believe in Anything You'll
    Believe in Anything"" floats on. Pretty-okay acoustic
    &amp; singin' tracks like ""Stadiums and Shrines"" or ""I
    Know the Weight of Your Throat"" might still sound like
    a guy in a basement with a tape-recorder, but at least
    the skillful application of lo-fi makes the song sound
    like it was made in a <em>haunted</em> basement, and
    sometime in the 1920's to boot.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the audio environment also makes it
    very difficult to tell whether there's anything of
    substance beneath the sea of hiss. Krug's Ziggy
    Stardust vocals will probably make or break the album
    for most people; I can already see the ""for fans of
    Arcade Fire &amp; Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!"" stickers. If
    you can't swallow this kind of over-dramatized
    singing, there's little to distract you on Snake's Got
    a Leg, as Krug doesn't add much more than the
    occasional off-rhythm handclap or ghostly accordion to
    the piano and guitar accompaniments.</p><p>
    
    Even instrumental tracks won't satisfy: the
    musicbox-like ""Sol's Song"" is relentlessly cyclical,
    and the promisingly electronic ""Cecil's Bells""
    fragments and fades out before achieving anything more
    than making weird noises. But the production of weird
    noises oftentimes seem the main goal of Sunset
    Rubdown, with the rare intrusions of solid songwriting
    (""Snake's Got a Leg II"", ""I'll Believe in Anything"")
    feeling as accidental as the distorted notes.</p><p>
    
    Unlike most lo-fi artists, determining whether Krug is
    a shallow talent hiding behind his Tascam can be
    somewhat objectively tested, thanks to the Wolf Parade
    material seeping out this summer. In that
    professionally recorded setting, Krug's songs sound
    simultaneously less compelling and more complete than
    the material on Sunset Rubdown-- Wolf Parade are
    another of the above-average indie-compendium type
    acts we can't help falling in love with, but the
    proper studio reins in some of the weirdness of Krug's
    yelps. Ultimately, however, with the two album's
    near-simultaneous release, the more accessible Wolf
    Parade likely makes the rough-edged lo-fi experiments
    of Sunset Rubdown a mere novelty throwback.</p></div>"|7816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7816-snakes-got-a-leg/|5.1|Rob Mitchum

    material, Circus Devils remain the most obtuse of Robert Pollard's side 
    projects. That's likely because Pollard isn't primary songwriter, his 
    vocals instead added to music created by extended GBV-family 
    member Todd Tobias.</p><p>
    
    With Guided By Voices dissolved and Pollard's next solo album, <em>From 
    A Compound Eye</em>, in release-date limbo, fans may feel the urge to 
    scramble for this record to tide them over to a more official Pollard release. Guys, girls, Postal Blowfishes, and fanatics: Take a pass on this 
    one.</p><p>
    
    Part of the Circus Devils' appeal is just how far it sounds from Guided 
    By Voices. Good or bad, it's a whole new context for Pollard's musings, 
    and that's certainly true of <em>Five</em>. Where previous releases saw 
    them balancing eerie psychedelia with more traditional rock songs, 
    <em>Five</em> opens with string-imitating keyboards, setting the tone for a 
    distinctly non-rock record. Expect a lot of beat-poet Bob without any of 
    the breaks into standard rock songs that previous Devils albums 
    provided. The early tracks are the most bewildering, with disorienting loops 
    of noise and ambient keyboards, through which snippets of soft rock 
    float in and out while Pollard does his best to sound like someone else. He 
    sings with a deep and strangely affected voice over the jaw harp 
    percussion and synth bass of ""Look Between the Eyes"" and the mush-mouthed 
    ""Atheroid Vogue"".</p><p>
    
    Despite his lyricist-only role, Pollard wedges his personality into the 
    later tracks. There's some oddball charm in the lumbering fuzzbox 
    groove of ""Animal Motel"", and ""We Taught Them Rock and Roll"" is the apes 
    learning from the monolith in 2001, but with beginner guitar riffs coming 
    out of a shitty practice amp instead of a monolith (there's still 
    plenty of Chewbacca-like animal screams). Elsewhere, the sluggish ambience 
    of ""Tell Them the Old Man is Coming Down"" or ""Dolphins of Color"" recall 
    the strained, world-weary introspection of GBV's major-label days.</p><p>
    
    But much of the thrill of the Fading Captain series is sifting for those unexpected nuggets of gold. Compile them all for the Ultimate Pollard/GBV Mix, and it'll unlock the gates to Paradise and push you right through, past a St. Peter who's shotgunning a beer and throwing up the horns. Let me get you there that much faster: None of those songs are 
    on <em>Five</em>. There aren't pleasant any surprises here along the lines of <em>Harold Pig Memorial</em>'s 
    ""Bull Spears"". What is here is a lot of work-- 23 
    tracks to get through without any familiar footholds.</p><p>
    
    If you haven't read it a dozen times before, here or elsewhere, there's 
    just a shit-ton of music with Pollard's name on it. It's intimidating 
    and exhausting to follow, and even compared to the other Circus Devils 
    efforts, <em>Five</em> is lacking. Maybe a hardcore fan will find more to 
    love than I did, but for the uninitiated, start anywhere but here.</p></div>"|1480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1480-five/|4.1|Jason Crock

Without taking into account     its fertile propagation via file-sharing networks, this new ""official"" edition of the record essentially marks its third release:     The band recorded and released it themselves pre-hype in 2003, selling it at shows and through their website.  The next year, Merge     Records began offering that same homemade EP through <i>their</i> website, in an attempt to sate the demand of an audience that had     quickly grown obsessed with the group's full-length debut, <i>Funeral</i>.  Now, in 2005, Merge is doing the inevitable: releasing     a remastered and repackaged version of these seven songs, and finally putting it in stores, where it arguably ought to have been     all along.</p>
<p>With its convoluted history, this EP is difficult to position in relation to <i>Funeral, which looms over it like a monumental     obelisk. While it's now nearly impossible to hear </i><i>The Arcade Fire</i> on its original 2003 terms, a comparison between the two     records proves potentially condescending (from my notes: ""... finds the band still unsure of their capabilities"").  Listeners who     didn't special-order the EP from Merge last year and are hearing the remastered versions of these songs for the very first time     should, if nothing else, find it revelatory, the first notes of a band confident enough to stage an evacuation of women, children,     and old folks during the coda of standout ""No Cars Go"".  But for the rest of us, <i>Funeral provides a new context as unflattering     as fluorescent lighting.</i></p>
<p>No matter how patronizing the comment parenthesized above may sound, it still proves mostly true: The EP shows a band still finding     its strengths and developing its sound, unsure of its talent for cathartic drama.  That is, they still sound like they did-- or will--     on <i>Funeral</i>, only less so.  The build-ups seem either less patient or less directed, the quick changes more deliberate, the     structures more top-heavy, and the payoffs ultimately less rewarding.  The band generates tension and energy, but don't always     recognize the best way to unravel it.  ""My Heart Is an Apple"" creates a subdued atmosphere for Win Butler's soulful vocals, but     there's no strong melody to anchor them, and as a result, the song flatlines.  Likewise, ""Headlights Look Like Diamonds"" has all the     elements of the anthems that made <i>Funeral</i> so compelling, but never achieves the same effect.  The homemade quality of these tracks,     which has become an Arcade Fire trademark on par with their homespun album packaging, gives them a gritty immediacy, but the remastering     only amplifies the problems the band would resolve with <i>Funeral</i>.</p>
<p>Still, it's important to point out that the EP is more than just dress rehearsal for the album. There are moments that not only hint     at the heights of that album, but scale such heights themselves.  ""Vampire/Forest Fire"" achieves the right balance of build-up and     release: Butler's vocals start measured and empathic, growing louder and stronger as the keyboards circle the chorus and the sound     climactically explodes.  But most of these tracks have more modest aims than such airy catharsis and achieve them through well-considered     instrumentation: the piano flutters that lifts ""I'm Sleeping in a Submarine"", the dodgy guitar melody that weaves through ""Old Flame"",     the melodic bassline and jolting drumbeat on ""No Cars Go"", the campfire percussion of ""The Woodland National Anthem"".</p>
<p>What connects The Arcade Fire so inextricably to <i>Funeral</i>-- and what makes the band so distinct-- is its tone of youthful     conspiracy (the EP is known unofficially as <i>Us Kids Know</i>).  On ""No Cars Go"" and ""Vampire/Forest Fire"", Butler and wife     Régine Chassagne write in a coded language explicitly for rock's original audience: kids.  But while they infuse the songs with a     dread and drama that reaches an adolescent intensity and bleeds into every track, they never retreat to a romanticized notion of     childhood.  As <i>Funeral</i> suggested and this EP proves, the Arcade Fire know that world is as treacherous as its adult mirror--     an insight encoded in the band's genetic make-up and a motivating force since striking their first note.</p></div>"|453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/453-arcade-fire-ep/|6.8|Stephen M.

Granted, for many that hard life is an integral part of his cachet: Arrested in 1969 and charged with possession, Erickson pleaded insanity rather than face jail time, and was committed to Rusk State Hospital. As legend has it, his mind was so devastated by the shock therapies and medications that he spent the rest of his life battling serious mental illness that left him easy prey for unscrupulous record promoters (who had him sign away his royalties for numerous reissues) and sabotaged almost every attempt at a comeback.</p>
<p>There are, of course, scores of 1960s cautionary tales, but the music Erickson helped to make and the lifestyle he promoted with the 13th Floor Elevators explicitly advocated drug use as mind expansion, as true spiritual freedom-- a bunk idea he shared with Jim Morrison, although even at his most obtuse, Erickson never descended to the empty-headed blathering and lounge-act crooning that were the hallmarks of the celebrated Lizard King. Erickson's psychedelia was not passive aural wallpapers-- all pretty shapes and colors to listen to while tripping-- but an active force of social, musical, and psychological change. Aside from the infamous album starter ""You're Gonna Miss Me"", which Erickson wrote for his previous band the Spades before rerecording with the 13th Floor Elevators, <i>The Psychedelic Sounds is awash in narcotic philosophy. And in case you miss it, Tommy Hall explains it all in his original liner notes. </i></p>
<p>However, what makes <i>The Psychedelic Sounds</i> powerful 40 years later isn't its questionable philosophy but, as the title makes clear, its psychedelic sound. The 13th Floor Elevators were a remarkable band: Erickson's wild-man vocals create an atmosphere where unfettered mayhem reigns. Stacy Sutherland's piercing guitar puts a dark mood on ""Roller Coaster"" and ""Reverberation (Doubt)"", while drummer John Ike Walton ties it all together. It's a dynamic that's even more pronounced on the eight live tracks on this UK reissue, which were recorded in San Francisco following the album's release. Their covers of Solomon Burke's ""Everybody Needs Somebody to Love"", the Beatles' ""The Word"", and even their take on that '60s live staple ""Gloria"", are anything but placid drugs trips or by-the-numbers re-creation; instead, the songs get the full psychedelic treatment as the Elevators play them like they're handling snakes.</p>
<p>As with any historical legacy, however, Erickson's reputation as the father of psychedelia is largely oversimplified. He was a late addition to the 13th Floor Elevators, which was the brainchild of Tommy Hall. Hall's acid poetry informs every song on <i>The Psychedelic Sounds</i> (aside from ""You're Gonna Miss Me"", Erickson's lone contribution). And, perhaps most important, it was Hall who plugged in his jug and provided the psychedelic sound that evokes the chemical weightlessness of a trip. It's the wiggedly-wiggedly of a dream sequence, the sound of your hands melting or of a dimensional door squeaking open. That the 13th Floor Elevators could translate that concept into an aural sensation is perhaps the root of their reputation and would have been impossible without Hall.</p>
<p>Erickson, however, undoubtedly was a creative force in the band, as a vocalist on <i>Psychedelic Sounds</i> and also as a songwriter on the follow-up, <i>Easter Everywhere. </i>Selections from those two albums, as well as from subsequent aborted comebacks, are collected on the two-disk<i> </i><i>I Have Always Been Here: The Roky Erickson Story</i>, which is, unbelievably, the first overview of his long, strange career. Erickson's is a long career to capture on only two disks, but Shout! Factory makes judicious use of the space not only to provide a chronology of Erickson's development over four decades, but also to paint him as a sort of outsider artist rather than as a victim.</p>
<p>Emphasizing Erickson's solo output over his reputation-making Elevators material, the collection includes only a handful of tracks from <i>The Psychedelic Sounds </i>and<i> </i><i>Easter Everywhere.</i> ""Slip Inside This House"" is a masterpiece of psychedelic inventiveness, a spacey blues jam that circles back on itself and eats its tail. On ""I Had to Tell You"" and the heartbreaking same-session outtake ""Right Track Now"", Erickson foregoes his usual hysterical vocals for a much more direct, reflective approach.</p>
<p>But <i>I Have Always Been Here</i> is more interested in Erickson's less-explored post-Elevators period, roughly from the mid-70s to the present. Whether solo or with the Aliens, he churned out potent and patently weird Texas blues rock similar to Stevie Ray Vaughn or early ZZ Top and often mimicked the vocal hiccups of fellow Texan Buddy Holly. In the 1970s, Erickson became fascinated with science fiction, re-creating B-movies with songs like ""Creature With the Atom Brain"" and ""Stand for the Fire Demon"". What makes these songs so kick-ass is that it's the sound of someone going right off the page of the rock script-- like so many B-movie auteurs of the '60s (Ray Dennis Steckler and Hal Warren, ill-fated director of <i>Manos: The Hands of Fate</i>, come to mind), he's doing whatever he wants with no one to tell him that's not how it's done.</p>
<p>As a result, very few of the songs on <i>I Have Always Been Here Before </i>depend for their impact on the listener's knowledge of Erickson's mental health at the time. This is perhaps the singer's true achievement, which this compilation generously spotlights: even when he was suffering, his strange music sounds wholly idiosyncratic and spiritually curious, the sound of a man who won't let the world's ugliness diminish his enjoyment of life or hinder his search for something solid and secure.</p></div>"|11855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11855-the-psychedelic-sounds-of-i-have-always-been-here-before/|9.1|Stephen M.

    The 
    band makes such monumentally icy music that I can't imagine primary 
    colors 
    having anything to do with it-- this music is washed-out amber, fuzzy 
    off-white, glimmering silver, lacking sharp contrast and exhalting the 
    distances between sounds.</p><p>
    
    It's an approach Auburn Lull have taken throughout their career, and 
    it's 
    yielded a body of work that could be easily criticized as 
    homogenous-- indeed 
    most people won't need more than one of their records. Without paying 
    close 
    attention, it's easy not to notice the passage of tracks and the subtle 
    shifting of moods and textures, but that's also what makes 
    this 
    retrospective of the band's non-LP material so satisfying. The songs 
    may be 
    drawn from across a decade, but they have a shared aesthetic.</p><p>
    
    Personalities of individual musicians are beside the point in this 
    music. 
    Guitars, bells, synths, even vocals and drums coalesce into a 
    diaphanous 
    whole where melodies move in languid waves and rhythm is often more 
    subliminal than obvious. Take ""TI-99"", for instance: Sean Heenan lays 
    down 
    a web of oscillator-generated drones, creating a billowy breath of a 
    song 
    whose textures are not terribly unlike the ones created with guitars 
    elsewhere on the set.</p><p>
    
    ""A Harbored Distance"" and ""Steady Light"" are more traditional songs,
    ground in reverb-soaked drums rhythms and straightforward vocal 
    melodies, 
    but both have that smeared Auburn Lull approach that draws 
    everything 
    hazily toward the other elements. ""Van Der Graaf"" has a slightly more 
    metallic texture than its counterparts, a darker brushed steel tone 
    that 
    sets it slightly apart. The biggest stand-out, though, is ""Rural 
    Divide"", a 
    stunning track that's among the band's best to date. Quite unlike most of the band's catalog, the song features a prismatic midsection that sets a 
    muffled 
    sample of a woman speaking amidst swirling somethings that sound like a 
    cross between electric piano, Tomorrowland synths, and e-bowed guitars.</p><p>
    
    Auburn Lull make a beautiful noise, and if you already have one of 
    their 
    albums and are looking for more, you'll love what you hear on this. 
    It's also not a bad place to start, but I'd suggest for <em>Alone 
    I 
    Admire for that purpose. But </em><em>Regions Less Parallel demonstrates how having 
    a 
    limited signature sound isn't necessarily a negative, so long as a band 
    realizes the many places it can travel within those limits.</em></p></div>"|353.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/353-regions-less-parallel-early-works-rarities-mcmxcvi-mmiv/|7.5|Joe Tangari

Over a minimal bass pulse and a few finger-snaps, the Ying Yang Twins turned down the volume on their gravelly crunk howling to whisper intense X-rated come-ons: ""Hey, bitch, wait till you see my dick/ I'ma beat that pussy up."" Sexually exploitative hip-hop is nothing new, but this track's air of menace and complete lack of subtlety made it the last straw for more than a few listeners of both genders, a point where they could no longer excuse the casual misogyny in rap music. On the internet, sides formed. Did ""beat the pussy up"" refer to rape or rough sex? Were the whispers threats or seduction? Was it a joke? If it were, would that excuse it?</p><p>
    
    If you're looking for answers, <i>United State of Atlanta isn't going to provide any. ""Wait"" is presented as part of a mid-album sex trilogy, followed by the even nastier spoken-not-sung track ""Pull My Hair"" and the awful quiet-storm slow jam ""Bedroom Boom"", and the three tracks are divided by skits of women with alert, precise speaking voices using spoken-word cadences talking about how they want to get fucked, as if the Twins are saying that intelligent women like this stuff, so it's OK. We also get ""Live Again"", a gliding, melodic mid-tempo track with a hook from (of all people) Maroon 5's Adam Levine, wherein the Twins paint a picture of a woman forced by economic circumstance into a job stripping, hoping to escape every day. And then there's ""Hoes"", where the Twins and female guest Jacki-O talk about hating hoes, with one Twin assuring women, ""If you a bitch and you hate a bitch, you can sing this shit, too!""</i></p><p>
    
    There's a lso a song about the inhumanities of the prison system, a bluesy track about the dehumanizing effects of poverty, a song about the Twins' love for each other, a song about Jesus, and a whole lot of songs instructing strippers on how to dance. So. Um. Fuck. Can we talk about the beats yet? Because the beats on <em>U.S.A.</em> are really something.</p><p>
    
    Collipark provides almost all the album's tracks, lacing the Twins' bluesy, throaty voices with gleaming, futuristic jacked-up electro. The best tracks repeat their hooks enough to turn them into mantras, bass kicks exploding and maddeningly simple keyboard lines worming their way into your frontal lobe, Miami bass and Chicago house run through extremely expensive sequencers and morphing into a radiant space-age bounce. It's first-rate club music, and first-rate club music is always worth your attention.</p><p>
    
    People shouldn't feel like they have to excuse or get past ""Wait""-- it's an entirely personal decision. If you feel OK about the track, you'll find that <em>U.S.A. is a good-not-great Southern rap album, overlong and weighted down by too many inept slow tracks but boasting enough furious, kinetic dance tracks to make it worth your money. If you don't, that's fine. Your life isn't going to be any poorer without this album.</em></p></div>"|8914.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8914-usa-united-state-of-atlanta/|7.5|Tom Breihan

Otherwise it's difficult to fathom what (besides sheer devoted friendship) might've prompted the Animal Collective to release the miserably shoddy trash-punk of <em>Jesüs Chryst</em> on their usually reliable Paw Tracks imprint.</p><p> 
    Though the label is clearly no stranger to unkempt, lo-fi recordings, there is none of the Animal Collective's beatific tribalism or even the homely charm of Ariel Pink's warped outsider pop on <em>Jesüs Chryst</em>. Instead the Peppermints specialize in a deliberately amateurish, almost quaintly anachronistic form of self-described ""barfy"" DIY punk that sounds gorged on G.G. Allin and <em>Killed by Death</em> comps. And though there's nothing inherently wrong with that, there's likewise nothing offered on this album that suggests the group has either the ability or the inclination to sculpt their slapdash rawk into anything innovative or distinctive.</p><p>
    Originally assembled in the San Diego area in 1997, the quartet of Lil G'Broagfran, M. Ron Hubbard, Grim Graham, and Ms. Hot Chocolate have not wasted any time in the intervening years doing anything as pedestrian as honing their songcraft or rehearsing. <em>Jesüs Chryst</em> is the Peppermints' second full-length following 2003's <em>Sweettooth Abortion, and was largely recorded by Hot Snakes' Gar Woods. Plowing through 18 tracks in a merciful 29 minutes, the album is an unholy blur of gracelessly screeched female vocals and disappointingly spindly guitars, at points recalling a lazier Melt Banana but utterly lacking that group's venomous precision and power.</em></p><p>
    As the album's title and songs like ""Sexy Total Fuck"" or the lustful lament ""Cousin"" suggest, much of <em>Jesüs Chryst</em>'s brief running time is spent attempting to make offense a skill, but there's little here that'll outrage anyone except the same stripe of Christian conservative who might protest the presence of a vampire puppet on ""Sesame Street"" teaching children to count. Besides, nearly all of the vocals here are delivered in a uniform shriek that renders most lyrics completely unintelligible, although on such exceptions as the chirpy ""Onion Salad"", lines like ""Take your clothes off/ Get molested/ It's festive/ Read the menu/ Take your nephew"" might indicate we're not missing much.</p><p>
    The opening ""Yellow Rain""-- which features a barbed twang suggesting a Ricky Wilson-penned B-52's track plagued by rowdy vandals-- delivers a solid minute of innocuously scruffy diversion, as does the burly noise of the pounding ""Rabid Frogs"". The glassy drone of ""Santorum"" provides the album its most intriguing change-up, but the bulk of <em>Jesüs Chryst</em> is likely to appeal only to the least discriminating punk palates, solely restricted to those who find the Peppermints' uncompromising crudity to be a virtue.</p></div>"|6577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6577-jesus-chryst/|3.7|Matthew Murphy

Moloko could do icy noir when they wanted but they  could also be playful and mischievous with an interest in off-kilter  pop. Their albums don't hold up all that well but they got better the further they went from their trip-hop roots and left a handful of good singles behind. ""Sing It Back"" from I Am  Not a Doctor is one such gem, and beyond its catchy chorus it now has  further significance since a remix brought Moloko singer Róisín Murphy  together with Matthew Herbert.</p><p>  After the fortuitous meeting over the mixing board, Murphy and Herbert  later decided to collaborate on this, her debut solo album. They wrote the  songs together and Herbert handled the production, melding his  intricate  sampling technique, which proceeds according to strict compositional  strictures, with contributions from other musicians, mostly horns and  reeds. All songs were released piecemeal earlier this year on three  low-profile 12"" EPs titled <em>Sequins 1-3</em>.</p><p>  It's hard to imagine anyone not ranking this is the best thing Murphy  has ever done. Her singing has definitely improved in a  technical sense, as she sounds more confident and controlled with her voice  basically stripped of processing. She's also ironed out some of her  trademark tics, mostly leaving behind the pinched nasal tone that  seemed intended to impart ""attitude"" to certain Moloko tracks. And behind  Murphy is some of Herbert's most balanced and functional music-- plenty  of glitches and odd noises but always deployed in the service of the  song.</p><p>  The first seven tracks are very nearly flawless. ""Leaving the City""  combines a repetitious pleading refrain by Murphy (""No more goodbyes!"")  with tense backing from Herbert at his busiest, the out-of-tune  guitar plucks imparting a palpable sense of urgency. ""Through Time"" is  another highlight with its airy bossa nova feel, the subdued and  spacious production complementing Murphy's voice at is rich and sultry  peak. Throughout Herbert uses the horns primarily for quick percussive  stabs and minute textural accents, magically evoking pop classicism  with  fussy micro-edited electronics. The towering opening run ends with the  album's first single ""If We're in Love"", one of the 2005's best to date  and a song that suggests that Murphy and Herbert could freelance as a  hitmaking r&amp;b songwriting duo if so inclined. ""Ramalama (Bang Bang)"" is  almost as excellent but more unusual, sharing with ""The Night of the  Dancing Flame"" a German cabaret feel, with dark jazz accents and  Herbert  molding gothic percussion into twisted gargoyle shapes.</p><p>  From there <em>Ruby Blue</em> takes a short excursion into a more experimental  direction that isn't quite as satisfying. The title track has an  awesome  overdriven guitar tone and sharp cool vocal layering but it feels very  underwritten compared to what has come before while ""Off On It"" a  meandering assemblage of cool noises. ""Prelude to Love in the Making""  is  a short snippet of a track called ""Love in the Making"" that appeared  complete on <em>Sequins 2</em>, and we're not missing much in excerpted form.</p><p> <em>Ruby Blue</em> ends with the gorgeous ballad ""Closing of the Doors"", played  on the piano that was certainly used to help write the rest of the  music  and was supplanted throughout by Herbert's always fascinating  synthesized stand-ins. It's a nice closer and a good reminder of what  makes this record so good. When the songwriting is on, <em>Ruby Blue</em> seems  perfect, the ultimate combination of human warmth and technological  know-how.</p><p> </p></div>"|5656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5656-ruby-blue/|8.4|Mark Richardson

    benefit of hindsight, which allows me to say now with some degree of confidence that Wolf Parade should have a pretty sick autumn.  I'm not just tossing around bold claims: The Montreal-via-Victoria quartet has already received celebratory
    write-ups in both <i>The New York Times and </i><i>Time</i>'s Canadian edition, been featured on <i>The Believer</i>'s highly touted
    music-issue compilation (covering an unreleased Frog Eyes song), and taken to the stage at NYC's Piano's to celebrate that disc's
    release.  The youngsters even played 2004's All Tomorrow's Parties in a showcase curated by their biggest influence, Modest Mouse,
    and worked closely with Isaac Brock-- he produced two tracks on this EP and turned knobs for much of their full-length debut,
    <i>Apologies to the Queen Mary</i>, which will be released in late September by Sub Pop.</p><p>
    
    There's more.  Guitarist/vocalist Dan Boeckner and drummer Arlen Thompson have played with the Arcade Fire (those are Arlen's
    drums you're hearing on <i>Funeral</i>'s ""Wake Up""), and Arlen is also in a two-piece with ex-Hot Hot Heat guitarist Dante Decaro.
    My favorite vocalist in the crew, keyboardist Spencer Krug, has played and recorded with Frog Eyes, toured as a pianist with Destroyer,
    and records solo material as the skeletal, lo-fi, and often stunning Sunset Rubdown.  (Check his take on one of Wolf Parade's best
    songs, ""I'll Believe in Anything"".)  So the question, then, is how to take Wolf Parade's music purely on its own terms, without
    the excess baggage of peripheral relations, anticipation, and perceived hype.</p><p>
    
    Well, let's start with what it sounds like.  Some will proclaim that Wolf Parade don't diverge too greatly-- if at all-- from the
    standard-issue indie rock template, and they won't necessarily be wrong about that.  Thing is, all old/new/left/right sounds are
    out there for anyone to pillage, but for a band to pillage with enough acuity or verve to make the stuff sound so much their own
    is a rarity.  Like Spencer, Dan, or Arlen's friends the Arcade Fire, Wolf Parade remold familiarity into especially effective
    anthems, ballads, and dance-floor crashers.  But unlike many of their peers, they transition between spastic pop and gloriously
    pretty Bowie theatricality without showing seams.  Here, layered hooks and caffeinated-savant melodies are recollected in tranquility.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Shine a Light""-- not to be mistaken for the Constantines track of the same name-- is an equatorial, upbeat blender of various
    vocal lines, wool-blanket laser-tag keyboards, and a cinched drum-and-guitar groove, until it eventually heaves and collapses into a
    keyboard pile-up finale.  ""You Are a Runner and I Am My Father's Son"" (included here, but also slated as the opening track of the
    forthcoming album) is Modest Mouse dancing a fuzzed minuet with <i>Rain Dogs</i> and <i>The Lonesome Crowded West's long-lost
    Orange Julius.  Unfortunately, the two non-LP B-sides aren't as hot: ""Disco Sheets"" boils down to post-punk Bowie (sans mountains'
    majesty), while ""Lousy Pictures"" is a mid-tempo circus ode (with a tricky <em>Pet Sounds</em> sleigh bell break) riffing on hanging
    in trees and throwing rocks at the sky.  Certainly, Sub Pop could've included any number of better tracks from the full-length, but
    then, it's not too difficult to see why they might not want to show all their cards at once.</i></p><p>
    
    As bloggers illustrate daily, hype now comes pre-packaged with backlash.  Kneejerks start sighing as soon as nice things start
    getting said, which for Wolf Parade might have been right around the time that the CBC Radio 3 sessions-- their first recordings
    to show palpable promise-- found their way onto the web last November.  But it's also worth noting that this band shouldn't be
    judged by this EP alone.  As a promotional tool seemingly designed to simply keep their momentum afloat, it's half castoffs and
    doesn't do justice to the way their infectious poetics unfold across <i>Apologies to the Queen Mary</i>, where bar-room sing-alongs
    break into hymns for hungry ghosts and summer anthems are somehow born cliche-free.  Still, for the curious, the two LP tracks should
    whet appetites for what's to come-- and judging the music purely on its own merits, that stands to be some fairly rewarding stuff.</p></div>"|8793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8793-wolf-parade-ep/|7.1|Brandon Stosuy

Yes, it's true that Collapsar, Oxes, and Fucking Champs are all three-piece, instrumental, math rock-influenced metal bands. Yes, it is also true that none of them have a bass player. And yes, all three bands are known for their over-the-top, ass-rocking live performances. But that is where the similarities end, my friend. Oh, wait, they kind of sound alike, too.</p><p>
    
    But seriously, let's not sell Collapsar short. Their debut, self-titled album is a mammoth fusion of metal, prog-rock, jazz, and math rock. The three members of Collapsar (guitarists Stephen Sheppert and Dave Graeff and drummer Brett Judice) are capable of creating constantly shifting rhythms and nimble-fingered guitar noodling. The lack of a bassist is barely noticeable, as one guitar is almost constantly holding down the low end with heavy, crushing riffs while the other explores the higher end of the neck. So sure, there are similarities, but it's a point that's easily forgotten once the stereo is cranked.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with ""Death's Other Dominion"", a track that highlights the band's jazz leanings. It also features a combination-- jerky, arrhythmic beat, progged-out guitar wankery, low-end crunch, and a pinch of melodic chord phrasing-- that most of the tracks follow at the risk of seeming repetitive. </p><p>
    
    The band's name comes from another word for a black hole, and ""Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla"" introduces the band's sci-fi element. Several tracks feature sci-fi and fantasy themed titles (""Pray to Thor"", ""Sleep Robot"", ""Robot Wins""), and the use of various guitar effects in the swirling, echoing breakdowns throughout the disc helps to tie it all together. ""King Kong Died for your Sins"" adds computer blips (actually, it's still guitar, but you'll swear differently on first listen) as it transitions from some of the heaviest and most intense riffing found on the disc to the most melodic and gentle. </p><p>
    
    The appropriately titled ""Opus 1"" finds the band in full-on prog mode. The track clocks in at nine-and-a-half minutes, and there are frankly too many musical shifts to describe. The track acts as a virtual sampler platter for the entire disc and features some of its most aggressive drumming and impressive guitar work. The length and shifts prove to be a bit too much, however, as when the band gets too herky-jerky, it's hard to really get caught up in the moment. Not that I'm actually trying to headbang along, but, you know, you just can't headbang to some of this stuff. </p></div>"|1812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1812-collapsar/|6.9|Cory D. Byrom

Tindersticks, for example, have been cranking out albums that freely migrate from posh lobbies to stained sheets, desire to addiction. On their debut EP, Absentee seem to be flirting with this same territory (right down to the donkey in the title), though not with quite the same success.</p><p>
    
    Most of the music rests in this ambiguous place between country indie rock-- eighth notes on the bass caressed by steel guitar and Daniel Michaelson's molasses baritone. An occasional stab of distortion-soaked guitar breaks the record's focus on slow, brooding ballads. So to does the sole up-tempo track, ""Something to Bang"", which is stuffed with fuzzy leads and pounding drums offset by Michaelson's steadfastly low-key vocals, which join the song at more of a walking pace and scarcely rise above a tone of casual conversation. ""I'm tired of being a man/ Always something to bang,"" he says, but his discomfort with his own desire in the lyrics isn't fully fleshed out.</p><p>
    
    Later, on ""In the Toilets Again"", he sings ""It doesn't help to know we're having sex without coming"" and it feels similarly, er, unfulfilled, as though the imagery of the song is hoping for the debased depths of the human spirit, but can't get past the ""doo doo doo doo"" backing vocals to find it. That the dirtiness in the lyrics feels frequently contrived is a major strike against the effectiveness of the record as a whole. Otherwise, things work nicely, as the band has a good sense of dynamics, and Michaelson's voice inhabits their countrified textures with heavy world-weariness.</p><p>
    
    So all the pieces aren't yet fitting together as they should, but Absentee are still a winning proposition on the whole. This is just a debut EP, 26 minutes long, and one gets the impression that this is a band that will sound more at home in the longer format of an album, where ideas can be drawn out and mistakes are more easily overlooked.</p></div>"|478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/478-donkey-stock/|6.8|Joe Tangari

On their debut full-length <em>The Aether Eater</em>, the Indiana trio's music suffers from a similarly potent strain of wanderlust, as their loopy art-rock travels impulsively from cracked Heartland balladry to hyper-inflated space-age keyboard pomp at the blink of a faulty engine light. And though these cosmic tourists manage to locate some admittedly fantastic points of interest, their haphazard navigational powers might cause even the most stir-crazy listeners to wait for assistance from more reliable guides.</p><p>
    
    Co-authored by the group's multi-instrumentalists Michael Tapscott and Isaac Edwards, <em>The Aether Eater</em> seems to be loosely constructed around the fabulous exploits of a waylaid astronaut who's had himself several adventures in the nether regions of the galaxy, whether at ""the back of Orion"" or ""the Tripton County Fair."" Interspersed with his tales are a handful of appropriately stardust-fuelled instrumental passages, as well as ""Benjamin"" and ""Kids"", a pair of brief childhood recollections that are unsettling in the way that only creepy childhood recollections can be. (""You've heard the stories told from kids in school/ About a boy who went walking in the woods and he died. Kids!"")</p><p>
    
    Though at various junctures the album points in vaguely baroque or folkish directions, it is primarily built on space-rock tracks like ""The Golden Fog"" and ""The Unnamed Sphinx"", where Edwards' ambient keyboards swell and undulate with gravity-defying splendor, while Tapscott's reedy, Neil Youngish pipes provide an unsteady torchlight through the celestial fog. And before things become overly familiar, Odawas also frequently include brief, seemingly arbitrary interjections of harmonica, flute, and harpsichord-- appearances whose unpredictability allows the listener little time to skim these placid waves on autopilot.</p><p>
    
    Strangest of all is ""Ant Man Messiah Elijah"", a trippy, partially spoken-word track that provides extensive exposition of the album's screwy narrative. ""I will set my course for the Pangean Bones that lie past the sun with the Nebulan Horse,"" intones Tapscott, in the type of heavily-effected (perhaps backwards-masked?) delivery that one might associate with a David Lynch dream sequence. That cleared up, the group are again free to continue forth, leading the listener through ""Behind the Moon"" and ""Song of Temptations"", two tranquil, rather uneventful instrumentals that utilize dreamy guitar textures, bagfuls of sci-fi sound effects, and even a courtly, <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> saxophone solo.</p><p>
    
    The album's journey ends logically enough with ""Virgil"", a track that serves as a tidy summary of last reminiscences (""Virgil was the best friend I'd had/ But he was a dream and I was a man"") and lessons learned (""To be saved you can have no sympathy/ And to be alive I must often grieve."") And though there are points on <em>The Aether Eater</em> at which you find yourself cautiously glancing around for the escape hatch, Odawas at least have the courtesy to deliver you unharmed back where you started, but good luck finding anyone to believe your stories of the experience.</p></div>"|6118.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6118-the-aether-eater/|6.7|Matthew Murphy

    <i>This Is Not a Test!</i>, was the sound of a once-great tag-team rehashing their own tricks with diminishing returns.  Yet, for
    such a tight-knit pair, it's long been a question how she might fare without his input.  On <i>The Cookbook</i>, we're given our
    answer.  Here, Timbaland has gone largely absent, and while it's refreshing to hear Elliott-- easily one of the most innovative and engaging artists to have
    graced hip-hop's microphone-- again imbued with purpose and something to prove, the duo's impossibly high standards and no-rules
    originality are sorely missed on some of the record's sleepier, more conventional tracks.</p><p>
    
    Like an untethered spouse suddenly separated from a longtime love, Elliott seems a bit lost somewhere between her intimidating past
    and her newfound independence.  Even more bipolar than usual, <i>The Cookbook</i> finds the rapper/singer jolting from uber-hypeness
    to soul-crushing balladry.  Fortunately, supported by an array of producers both grizzly and green, her invaluable unpredictability
    is alternately harnessed and given new life on this album, despite its uneven and transitional nature.</p><p>
    
    Elliott eases into the transition, opening the album with Timbaland's only two productions.  After a remarkably unnecessary intro
    track featuring guest vocals from Mike Jones, the platinum club's least charismatic new star, Timbo slides in with ""Joy"", a wispy
    thump that would sound a lot more radical and stealthy if the Ying Yang Twins had never learned to speak softly about big sticks.
    Jones returns at the end of the track to (you guessed it) say his name repeatedly and spout off his cell number, quickly turning a
    once-clever self-promotion routine into a particularly shameless home-shopping network ploy.  This is followed by the generic
    ""Partytime"", which finds Elliott sticking it to defenseless has-beens like Coolio and Sisqo (was Kris Kross too obvious?).</p><p>
    
    Of course, never one to kill in a lyrical showdown, Elliott compensates for such limitations with a gum-chewing sass that's virtually
    unparalleled.  A vocal chameleon, she's the rare artist who can score as both a sultry r&amp;b; crooner and a hot-shit rhyme slapper.
    Showing off the latter persona, Elliott crushes on the Rich Harrison burner ""Can't Stop"".  His tribal drums and blast-off horns
    should sound exhausted after ""Crazy in Love"" and ""1 Thing"", but they still manage to provide Missy with a spectacular foundation
    on which she unleashes a flurry of typically blunt sex raps.  Likewise, destructive sub-bass and cartoonish bendy-metal boosts
    help to make ""On &amp; On"" the Neptunes' most inventive track since ""Drop It Like Its Hot"", on which Pharrell pulls off a strikingly
    authentic Slick Rick impression.</p><p>
    
    This, however, is after the <i>real</i> Rick puts in a cameo on the half-rap, half-r&amp;b; throwback ""Irresistible Delicious"".  Continuing
    <em>Under Construction</em>'s old-school archival tendencies, ""Irresistible"" doesn't just feature the legendary eye-patched tale-twister;
    it also heavily samples his awesome ""Lick the Balls"".  It's further proof that, despite her insistence that her ""style can't be
    duplicated or recycled,"" Elliott isn't afraid to rehash others' material-- including the timeless ""Apache"" on ""We Run This"", and
    Mary J. Blige's ""What's the 411?"" beat on ""My Struggles"".  In fact, she often flirts with both reverence and unoriginality to a
    disconcerting degree.  ""Irresistible"" ducks such criticism with its beautifully lush, if oddly tacked-on chorus, which offers the
    album's most appetizing singing-Missy moment, but other slow-jams fail miserably: The Scott Storch-produced ""Meltdown"" makes Carrie
    Underwood's drippy ""Inside Your Heaven"" sound like a genre-defining new classic, while American Idol Fantasia Barrino just sounds
    like a sober Macy Gray on ""4 My Man"".</p><p>
    
    Finisher ""Bad Man"" enticingly sees Elliott looking to the future of body-bending beats with an electro-palpitating bounce that
    wouldn't sound out of place on <i>Arular.  Fittingly, M.I.A. and Vybz Cartel drop by for guest shots, and Maya's hungry sneer
    pushes Missy to new ragga-tinged heights.  The song makes a convincing case for Elliott to take another stab at creating a
    back-to-front Timboless record more suitable to her near-peerless pedigree.</i></p></div>"|2759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2759-the-cookbook/|6.8|Ryan Dombal

    he's 
    ""the best I am at what I do."" He tells us several more times 
    throughout. 
    What he does is DJ grime on venerable London pirate radio station Rinse 
    FM. 
    So why is dude so full of hubris?</p><p>
    Well, a lot of people credit him with bringing the vocal anthem back to 
    the 
    scene after a long stretch of instrumental singles designed for MCs to 
    spit 
    over live. And he's been one of the DJs pushing the r&amp;g; (that's rhythm 
    &amp; 
    grime) sound (about which more later) that many others credit with 
    pulling 
    the scene back from near total darkness and, well, grime. Oh, and he's 
    managed to beg, borrow, or steal more than three dozen anthems, exclusives, and 
    freestyles 
    to put together what amounts to, as he sez, the best grime mixtape 
    ever. So 
    I think he's earned his talkover intrusions. (My only request, if he ever reads this, is that he get his own version 
    of 
    the DJ Clue/Kayslay/et al explosion FX, preferably a giant bell sound, 
    á la 
    Big Ben.)</p><p>
    With 40 tracks in 80 minutes, Sama doesn't waste much time 
    lingering 
    over pretty melodies, extended beat sections, or even second verses in 
    most 
    cases. Like a Jamaican selector or the friend you haven't seen for a 
    while 
    with a clutch of new music to play you, he's slamming from one cool 
    part of 
    a track to the next and fuck letting it play until it gets boring. (Derrick May and Larry Levan would not be pleased.) The result, at least 
    for 
    the first half, seems to ratchet up the intensity with each new 
    track.</p><p>
    There's Kano's ""P's &amp; Q's"", a track that doesn't <em>feel</em> like an 
    anthem the 
    first 300 times, but then he says ""slippin"" in that lazy menace way of 
    his 
    for the 301st and you can almost hear it. The Mitchell Brothers' 
    ""Routine 
    Check"" is ""99 Problems"" relocated to Hobbiton with 
    another 
    slurry-of-porridge-out-of-the-corner-of-his-mouth cameo from Mike 
    Skinner. 
    (Sounding more than ever out of step with ""proper grime"" and better for 
    it.) 
    Track of the mix, if I was forced to choose with the bamboo shoots at 
    the 
    ready, is Dogzilla's ""Hallo"". Produced by Danny Weed, it's got 
    the 
    big, fuck-off stadium drums we've come to expect (Bonham on a lean) and 
    some 
    pretty vicious guitar stabs and of course I am going to be sympathetic 
    to 
    any song which contains the command ""kiss my fat, white arse."" Jammer 
    proves 
    he's not just looking like Lil Jon these days with the shouty ""Merkle 
    Man"", 
    followed by even more Danny Weed bathysphere booms on Roll Deep's ""When 
    I'm 
    'Ere"", this time with extra accordion.</p><p>
    I still have my reservations about the middle r&amp;g; section however. 
    While I 
    appreciate that it's getting the ladies back in the clubs, something 
    still 
    feels cheap about putting r&amp;b; vocals over a grime instrumental and 
    calling 
    it a new genre. It's produced a handful of amazing tunes, but sometimes 
    it 
    just sounds like 2-step with some new noises or (worse) British r&amp;b.;  
    Now 
    I'm getting my xenophobia <em>and</em> my masculine bias on, but if grime is 
    the 
    British reponse to rap, then they got a ways to go before they work up 
    a 
    comparable response for soul. (Okay, okay, fine. I am being too harsh. 
    In 
    six months I probably won't even feel the same way. I hated Kano's 
    ""What 
    Have You Done?"" and now I think it's a masterpiece. Caveat emptor.) But 
    then, wooo! He rallies with an extended outro of bangers, like the 
    amazing 
    throwback UKG of SLK's ""Hype! Hype!"" featuring maybe the most exuberant 
    vocals any grime MC has yet spit. (Sticky productions always have great 
    vocals...come home, Lady Stush!)</p><p>
    Grime is great! So here's my request for the rest of the summer. No 
    more 
    articles about whether it's going to break the U.S. rap market (it hasn't 
    even 
    really broken the UK), no more whining it hasn't broken out from the 
    hipster 
    ghetto in the U.S., no more sociological treatise or attempts at your 
    thesis. 
    Enjoy the records as is. I don't care how you do it. Pretend they are 
    transmission from Pluto. Or Sublime Frequencies is putting them out. 
    Leave 
    the ""state of grime""/""future of grime"" to the eventual history books.</p><p>
    Grime is great!!</p></div>"|2090.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2090-rwd-magazine-mixtape-vol-1/|9.0|Jess Harvell

Their music makes you
    want to punch someone, then grab and hug him. It sounds piped straight from bygone
    airwaves, yet feels new, potent, and very much undeveloped. Most
    perplexingly, <em>A Good Ground</em>-- the Brooklyn trio's new full-length,
    which retreads a lot of the good ground covered on 2004's <em>Some
    Wilderness</em>-- is inconsistent in a strange way: The Collapse trade off
    between songs in their exciting, fully-formed voice, and happily
    inconsequential rock by rote. The band often seem shy of their own
    talents, content to hammer a sloppy backbeat under familiar-sounding
    changes. When this formulaic approach is buttressed by a hook-- which
    happens excitingly often-- the OC are unstoppable, burning up
    imaginary stages, dominating 80s underground rock retrospectives, and
    owning the charts 23 years ago.</p><p>
    
    Of the two bands present on <em>A Good Ground</em>, I prefer the one
    responsible for ""Proofreading"". The guitar has a kinetic, galloping
    quality not seen since Replacements and Feelies walked the Earth. But
    while the OC mine the barren lands of Hoboken for archaeological
    evidence of their ancient heroes, the band have some new millennial
    fight in them. ""Prop Cars"" is loud, choppy, and desultory in a manner
    more closely identified with tough dude hardcore than cardigan-clad
    indie rock. All it misses is the outta-my-way clarity of a lead
    melodic line. That's something ""Last American Virgin"" brings, albeit
    in bass notes. Adam Rizer delivers warm, overanxious basslines that
    barely appear in the mix, like soap submerged in bathtub water. His
    line on ""LAV"" is one of this album's best, but what I love most about
    the song (besides the cowbell) is the ending: Who writes a killer
    bridge, rife with transitional possibilities, and plays it for eight
    too-quick measures before pulling the plug? It's such a novice move,
    it shows enormous maturity.</p><p>
    
    As for the other band, they're for the most part smothered. Opener
    ""Empty Fields"" means well and is quick enough (1:12) but, sans melodic
    or structural development, ultimately pointless. A better song to pop
    the cork with would have been the epic, faded-in ""Last American
    Virgin"" or the wordless ""Cracks in the Causeway"", whose gentle ""ba di
    bop di""s offer a charming how-do-you-do. The only other dud is ""No
    Great Shakes"", which sounds like an early B-side:  muzzled,
    self-conscious and disappointingly simplistic for a group of rhythmic
    contortionists. See the lithe, pensive ""The Boys Go Home"" for an
    antidote.</p><p>
<em>A Good Ground</em> is made for trebly car speakers on late-night drives
    down empty, lamp-lit parkways. Or not. Ideal listening contexts are,
    of course, always subjective, but Oxford Collapse are worth the time
    it takes to discover one. Folks will kvetch about the washy recording
    sound and Mike Pace's yelped (and sometimes even yodeled) vocals--
    tasteful affects at the heart of the band's sound. But there's
    something refreshing about a band as stubborn as Oxford Collapse: sure
    to be hated on for a handful of abrasive, outmoded stylistic choices,
    they remain adamant and unswerving. That devotion shines through on
    this mostly wonderful record.</p></div>"|6116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6116-a-good-ground/|7.8|Sam Ubl

Blumm's third album, I was seeking revenge. Not on Frank Schültge Blumm, but on all the virtuosos I've encountered since fourth grade band class, when the girl down the street outplayed me in ""When the Saints Come Marching In"", reducing me to tears. You see, these virtuosos impeccably run up and down their scales, nailing their chords and key changes without any love for the music itself-- only its technicality. So here I go, ready to launch into my anti-Blumm harangue and release 12-plus years of embitterment when...aw shucks, Blumm done tugged on my heartstrings, again.</p><p>
    True, I should've seen this coming. 2002's <em>Ankern</em> wooed and coddled listeners with delicate melodies and gorgeous arrays of guitar, strings, piano, and nearly any other instrument he could get his hands on. As indie's answer to Yanni, Blumm left reviewers muttering sweet nothings like ""atmospheric"" or ""uplifting."" However, sheer prettiness couldn't hide that <em>Ankern</em> was often downright boring. On <em>Zweite Meer</em>, we find Blumm poking his musical ideas with a stick, wakening marginal progress.</p><p>
    Blumm's one-word track titles set the table for his equally sparse songs. Opener ""Sonn"" makes great background music, but sounds like a misplaced cog from a Sufjan Stevens arrangement or, say, something by Mouse on Mars, to whom Blumm has contributed the occasional horn or classical guitar part. The rest of the album comes across like a fusion of nearly every genre imaginable: Although the album's deeply rooted in folk and classical music, flecks of pop, shoegazer, lo-fi, and jazz pepper the otherwise homogenous mix. Unfortunately, the pulsing bass of ""Wass"" or clean-toned guitar improvising on ""Wamdel"" make mere divots on Blumm's otherwise flat, fallow landscape. </p><p>
    Before I completely scorch Blumm's songwriting chops, I will say this-- the man makes some damn charming music. Having a beef with innocuous music is hard, and I wouldn't mind hearing this album in every elevator I ever enter for the rest of my life. <em>Zweite Meer</em>'s a veritable soundtrack for our lives, or rather the quotidian grocery shopping/mowing the lawn portion of them. It's probably playing in your room right now, you just don't notice it.</p></div>"|827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/827-zweite-meer/|6.9|Adam Moerder

Had they appeared in the 
    mid-1980s, their cheeky hard-rock riffs, campy group harmonies, and trombone 
    accompaniment could have fit alongside those smirking early alternative 
    acts that only get remembered for joke hits: Violent Femmes, They Might 
    Be Giants, Camper Van Beethoven, etc. Had it been the 
    mid-90s, their hard-driving melodies that keep the influence of Nirvana while showing humor and restraint. Today, their velvet-gloved take on modern rock might be an 
    odd fit, but they've made a cohesive record that has a few memorable 
    moments.</p><p>
<em>Give Me All Your Money</em> is the group's 
    second record (their first for DeSoto Records). The songs tread the line 
    between light-hearted and detached, which at the very least lends them 
    a unique personality. If their campy, defanged delivery is too much for 
    you, and you like your rock sweaty and sincere, there's still more than 
    a couple songs with wider appeal. ""A Dark Time for the Light Side of 
    the Earth"" stretches its sludgy tempo into a success with interlocking 
    guitars and a catchy vocal melody, while the perky ""Day Is Done"" is the 
    perfect mix of a minimal guitar melody, trombone, and group harmonies. 
    ""Sidestepping"" lays the album's most earnest vocal performance over a 
    simple chord progression and build-and-fall dynamics, breathing new life 
    into old gimmicks.</p><p>
    
    Then there's that trombone. They don't make a lot of noise about having 
    one, just subtly slide it into the songs without announcement. 
    However, they're not using it the way they use guitar, bass, and drums, as a 
    primary instrument. Sometimes it works, and folds in seamlessly as 
    another burst of melody as in ""Day is done"", and sometimes it gives me 
    third-wave ska flashbacks, as when it's forced into the bridge of 
    ""Joybirds"". Even if they make it fit, does this band need a full-time trombone 
    player for the occasional blurt of a horn? (Maybe on stage, he dances in 
    a plaid suit when he's not playing.)</p><p>
    
    Songs like ""Let You Down"" let their cuteness (""You'll never see me 
    naked, I'll never let you down"") overcome it's boisterous riffing. That's a 
    shame, since <em>Give Me All Your Money</em> is for the most part a subdued album, one that could use more spirited performances like ""Day Is 
    Done"". The tricky thing exemplified by ""Let You Down"" is that Doris 
    Henson are capable players and songwriters, but that 
    artistic detachment feels like a disappointing ""comment"" on guitar-rock . I love the fact Doris 
    Henson have a sense of humor, but the 
    flip between the smirk and the earnestness is awkward-- and tracks like 
    ""Sidestepping"" or the dreamy closer ""When You Go"" just shine so much 
    brighter to my ears.</p></div>"|2616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2616-give-me-all-your-money/|6.7|Jason Crock

Kelly a joke or a genius?  Does he really expect us to forget his recent... unpleasantness, or does he just not care <i>what</i>
    we think?  Given the charges against him, how is he still recruiting A-list guest stars?  How many metaphors for sex can one man think
    up?  What the fuck is up with that album cover?  Is the <i>Matrix-quoting ""Reloaded"" an even more dated album title reference
    than </i><i>TP2.com?  R. Kelly is surrounded by more question marks than the Riddler, and I won't lie: All the baggage, mysteries,
    and moral quandaries make for a thick slice on the pie chart of R. Kelly enjoyment.  The difficult part, then, is clearing away all
    that brush to get to the music, which is one reason he's the current king of r&amp;b;: For all the absurdity of his ""Trapped in the Closet""
    cycle and his endless stock of creative horniness, the man is an absolute master of his medium.</i></p><p>
<em>TP3 Reloaded</em> is one of those albums where every song sounds like a radio single, and since I live in Chicago, I'll likely be
    able to cross each one off the list by the end of the summer.  Kelly cruises through genres like he's giving a guided tour, hitting
    crunk, dancehall, hip-hop, reggaeton, and naturally, a handful of bedroom ballads along the way.  Production work is minimal, guest
    stars pay deference to their album host, and the entire album puts Kelly, his malleable voice, and his considerable persona center
    stage.</p><p>
    
    Though R. Kelly's last outing was a departure, a two-disc concept album dealing with largely PG-rated topics like Jesus and steppin',
    <em>Reloaded</em> finds him back lecturing on his favorite topic: fucking.  Fucking in the kitchen, fucking on the third date, fucking
    in R. Kelly's XXL white tee.  Comparing fucking to remote control use, arson, and the chronic.  Of course, Kelly's not quite so crass
    (he even self-beeps the f-word in the fifth ""chapter"" of ""Trapped in the Closet""), but the junior-high sex synonyms don't dilute the
    XXX; they merely keep it just barely radio-friendly.</p><p>
    
    With such an unrelenting theme, <i>TP3 Reloaded's 75 minutes might test the patience of those not simultaneously engaging in
    the activities described-- and even those who are will likely find a few weak spots.  Fortunately, there's enough gold buried in
    </i><i>TP3</i> worth digging for: ""Happy Summertime"" is a laid-back dream meetup of world-class sing-rappers, as Kelly and Snoop Dogg
    trade verses about harmony betwixt Cali and the Chi (including what just might be the hip-hop debut of Millennium Park).  Kelly's
    catchy cadence keeps him afloat on the Missy-like ""Reggae Bump, Bump"" with Elephant Man or the martial reggaeton of ""Burn It Up"".
    Most likely to score the summer's barbecues are the straight hip-hop numbers: ""Playas Only"", featuring The Game, is already dominant,
    and ""Hit It Till the Morning"", with its itchy beats and rudimentarily effective Twista appearance, is waiting on deck.</p><p>
    
    All the same, your tolerance for the album is contingent upon your appreciation for the more humor-shock slow grooves.  Take the
    ""Trapped in the Closet"" cycle, for instance-- perhaps the most bizarre, audacious, brilliant undertaking a major artist has attempted
    in years.  Its five parts close out the album, and that's a blessing to the listener, as one listen is probably enough for even the
    most die-hard concept-music fanatic.  Tracks like ""Remote Control"" (despite its dandy Prince impression) and ""Sex Weed"" similarly
    run the risk of succumbing to their concept: After you've heard Kelly refer to his girl's ""sticky-icky"" once, subsequent listens
    fail to pack the same punch.</p><p>
    
    But no matter your personal taste for songs like ""Put My T-Shirt On"", don't be so condescending as to think Kelly is being unintentionally
    funny-- there's no way R. can't know how Chappelle-like the line ""Lying here in the bed checking you out while you're in the bathroom,
    girl"" sounds, but clearly it doesn't bother him.  Restraint fits R. Kelly about as well as suspenders and a bow tie, and shackling
    his libido is likely what led to the relative commercial bellyflop of last year's <em>Happy People/U Saved Me</em>.  <em>TP3 Reloaded</em>
    might be an unfortunate title, but it's at least an accurate one: Chicago's musical skyscraper pops Viagra and strikes the phallic
    pose he knows best.</p></div>"|4597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4597-tp3-reloaded/|7.4|Rob Mitchum

    <em>Hex Enduction Hour</em>. It sure as hell doesn't start with the <i>458489

    don't just take the word of some bitter no-talent sweater-wearing 
    Pitchfork Media jerk. Renowned musicologist Courtney Love swears by

    like <em>Hex Enduction Hour</em>! Why, one went so far as to play catch with 
    my driver's side backseat window using a piece of concrete, just to get 
    a hold of a copy.</i></p><p>
    
    Castle has kindly reissued the album, 
    and added a bonus disc. The recent Peel Sessions collection makes the 
    inclusion of two session tracks somewhat superfluous, but that 
    valuation 
    assumes you're fanatical enough that the decision to drop upwards of 
    $50 for a 6xCD set of radio sessions is no biggie. If 
    you're not so disposed, enjoy this interpretation of ""Deer Park"" 
    (the third on this collection) and a rinky-dinked ""Who Makes The 
    Nazis?"" 
    that replaces the introductory ping-ponging bass line with some 
    banjo-sounding plunking. In addition, there's a B-side-- ""I'm Into 
    C.B."", which sounds like a Fall B-side-- and some live tracks. Most notable from the live stuff is the inappropriately titled ""Jazzed
    Up Punk Shit"", unless their idea of jazz came from traveling into the
    future to watch <em>This Is Spinal Tap</em>. It's more like down-tempo
    Fall shit, the band puttering along on E (the fuel gague reading,  not
    the recreational aid) as Mark E. mulches ""shit"" into ""shirt."" All of
    this is good, by the way.</p><p>
    
    No write-up concerning the Fall is complete without mentioning and/or 
    quoting their gone-but-not-forgotten patron saint John Peel, so here 
    you 
    go: ""Always different, always the same."" And that's <em>Hex</em> in a 
    nutshell. You've got two-drummer, four-on-the-floor rave-ups like ""The 
    Classical"", you've got pensive seethers like ""Hip Priest"", and you have 
    a kazoo on ""Nazis?""-- all different, but all the same. It's Mark E. 
    Smith's scatological charisma that makes, breaks, and remakes the Fall. 
    As has been said before and will be said many times, the Fall are pre-, 
    post-, and beyond punk, taking the same old tools and building timeless 
    machines. Atavistic in approach, futuristic in scope. And catchy as 
    all hell, too-- phrases like ""hey there, fuckface"" and ""he is not 
    appreciated"" are hard to escape, either while listening to this record 
    or doing anything else. The most quotable tidbits, however, are the 
    ones that can't be neatly discerned through Smith's interpretive 
    elocution. In regards to a pseudo-intellectual magazine editor: ""Has a 
    beard which was weird/ Some time ago heard Ramones in '81/ Has a 
    Spanish guitar."" In regards to who makes the Nazis: ""Motels like three 
    split-level mirages...Buffalo lips on toast, smiling.""</p><p>
    
    But what does it sound like, you may ask? Well, it sounds like the 
    Fall. It sounds like a group of five talented musicians trying to play 
    as brilliantly stupid as possible, while a sixth fellow from the docks 
    hops on stage, grabs the mike, and fights his way through the morass 
    scorched-earth style. It sounds like the primordial ooze that birthed 
    touchstones like the Stooges and the Velvet Underground come to life, 
    nursing a bitch of a hangover and a vendetta. It's something you're 
    born with, not something you learn. And, as on most Fall records, but 
    especially this one, it's something to behold.</p></div>"|2979.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2979-hex-enduction-hour/|9.6|David Raposa

    Eyes called <em>Beast</em>. But if Smegma can be considered 
    part of that scene, it's only by default: they've been making their 
    psychedelic free-jazz noise for more than 25 years. They began by helping to 
    found the Los Angeles Free Music Society, and have collaborated with 
    everyone from Wild Man Fischer to Merzbow to the infamous rock critic 
    Richard Meltzer along the way. The noise scene has grown unto them while 
    they've kept a low profile and persistently crafted their avant-garde 
    improvisations under the radar, firmly outside of the mainstream due to 
    their confrontational sonics and formless compositions. (And, just maybe, 
    the fact they named their band after uncircumcised dick leak.)</p><p>
    
    My first exposure to Smegma was from somewhere less expected: <em>The 
    Completed Soundtrack for The Tropic of Nipples</em>, in which Meltzer and 
    Robert Pollard filled opposing tracks with faux-beat poetry over 
    free-jazz and punk rock backing bands, respectively, each competing for the 
    best non-sequitur. (One of my favorites: ""There's no need for senseless 
    bloodshed/ The mosquitoes dropped their javelins and looked on/ Oh man, 
    far out, it's king frog"") Smegma provided the soundtrack to Meltzer's 
    contributions, and he's since become their singer under the alias ""Borneo 
    Jimmy"".</p><p>
    
    Just because there are vocals doesn't make Semgma's music any more 
    accessible. Meltzer's voice is another disorienting texture, another oblong 
    puzzle piece where we need a corner. Whispering different euphemisms 
    for the homeless-- and hamburgers-- has never been creepier than on the 
    scraping and squealing of ""Bunstuffer"", and the morale of the story told 
    in ""Worms"" will make sense to only the most devoted alleyway wino. If 
    there are themes present in Meltzer's rambling streetcorner fables, 
    they're still not a hook to hold onto, so don't think Smegma less 
    challenging for having a ""vocalist""; if anything, they're more so.</p><p>
    
    Despite the names mentioned above, <em>Rumblings</em> is not an album of 
    trance-inducing sine waves or face-stabbing feedback; Smegma create a 
    unique cacophony from tape loops, blurting horns, pots and pans, sheet 
    metal, radio static, duck calls, and Meltzer's ramblings. Thinking about 
    <em>Rumblings</em> in terms of free jazz is more useful than contemporary 
    noise analogues, but there's still potential to be hypnotized by the 
    sounds on <em>Rumblings</em>. Tracks like ""Rails (Unhinged)"" blend the 
    faraway sound of typewriters and office equipment, along with what sounds 
    like an unmanned grocery cart rolling down an asphalt incline, into a 
    calming and evocative soundscape. ""In an Ornamental Garden"" mixes the 
    squealing saxophone that dominates <em>Rumblings</em> with traditional 
    Eastern flutes and strings, and even harsher songs like ""Electron"" or ""Fool 
    For You..."" give quirky interruptions to their droning, belying a sense 
    of humor under the claustrophobic choas.</p><p>
    
    The really strange parts are when they actually try to play their 
    instruments and veer into trashy, incompetent punk. Just when I think 
    they're clever confrantationalists, they go and rationalize the argument that 
    avant-garde musicians ""just can't really play""-- songs like 
    ""Moonleggs"", ""Worms"", and ""Rumblings"" sound like a completely different band, a 
    group of wanna-be rockabilly misfits making up songs in the garage. 
    Smegma aren't just avant-garde, they're committed to staying amateurishly 
    campy, balancing their cacophonies with earnest attempts at 
    open-mic-night punk. Whatever you want to call it-- ""noise"" doesn't quite cut it-- 
    they're consistent about it, and they're unwaveringly dedicated to 
    confounding audiences with their outsider rock.</p></div>"|7813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7813-rumblings/|7.2|Jason Crock

    Mehlan compared to Jamiroquai <em>and</em> Arthur Russell. Weird, right?
    I respect the assessments, actually, but lean toward Russell's
    fragility, especially as heard on <em>World of Echo</em>. Mehlan does foster a sunny
    vibe you could consider kinda Jay Kay on delivery alone, but a
    closer approximation is Russell's semi-falsetto and the fractured
    instrumentation graphed to the Sea &amp; Cake's Sam Prekop.</p><p>
    
    Skeletons began as the solo project of Shinkoyo Records co-founder Mehlan. His last record, <em>I'm at the Top of
    the World</em>, received praise here at Pitchfork, and before that he
    released <em>Everybody Dance With Your Steering Wheel</em> in 2002 and
    <em>Life and the Afterbirth</em> in 2003. Mehlan's still the skipper on
    <i>Git, but after playing live shows with a
    backup band, he's opted to lay down a recording with
    collaborators tagged ""The Girl-Faced Boys."" They're
    now a multi-instrumental five-piece in which everyone sings, plays percussion, and
    contributes a share of the guitar, bass, and laptop clicks.</i></p><p>
    
    Despite the time spent unpacking timbre, Mehlan's voice is just one
    component of Skeletons' assorted post-rock, world-beat
    electro-acoustics: Imagine aforementioned warblers backed by Liquid
    Liquid, Talking Heads, and perky IDM. Still, the way he croons on a given track is often its
    make-or-break. At times, he <em>is</em> too Jamiroquai. In fact, the best
    moments arrive when he lets music drift away from language, as on ""Do
    You Feel Any Better?,"" which drops vocals after a couple minutes, allowing electro clicks and curves complete with rain
    forest sounds to lift-off. Belying its goofy name, ""There's a Fly In
    Your Soup and I Put It There"" is a ghostly chorus of bleats and sighs
    over digital tweaks and twitters, and the opening patch of ""Y'all Thinks It's Soo
    Easy""-- a tag of percussion woven with a clipped loop and muffled
    Mariachi-- could be expanded into the best !!! ever.</p><p>
    
    There are instances where the vocal/instrumental paring goes well, such as on ""While We Were at the Movies"", a piano/laptop-fronted
    piece that evaporates amid a libretto of removal: ""Take away the locks
    on your door/ Take away your aspirin/ Take away your knives/ Take
    away of your alcohol, etc."" It makes sense to stop the song
    mid-beat, as it too is removed with all this other domestic detritus.</p><p>
    
    I know Mehlan's at times singing about mild darknesses, but <em>Git</em>
    always sounds pristine, as if songs were vacuum-packed in
    post-production. Because of this, even when the lyrics deal with
    scratching mosquito bites until nails come off or showing scars or
    when Mehlan sings ""We won't be proud/ We'll just think you're an
    idiot"", I kept thinking ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"". Likewise, there's talk of the experimental
    ""out"" sounds of the instrumentation, but despite his
    liberal use of bells and whistles (and junkyard percussion), even
    mainstream hip-hop offers more oddly shuffling (and often more
    compelling) accompaniment.</p><p>
    
    But just because this isn't as innovative or feverish as some would have
    you believe doesn't mean <em>Git</em> lacks value. The songs
    are pretty and I imagine these guys will have success, but much of the time it sounds like it was recorded in an operating room. Dr. Mehlan and company really outta scuff-up the sterility.</p></div>"|7747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7747-git/|7.0|Brandon Stosuy

    unresolved. Ryan Adams has long since exposed himself as merely a
    gifted mockingbird; Wilco assimilated Brian Wilson sunshine and
    Radiohead abstraction only to give your stepdad, with their latest,
    something hep to hawk on Half.com. Whither, then, the weary, Dust Bowl
    clarity of so-called alt-country? Could modern Americana, already
    deeply imitative, evolve without imitating yet something else?
    Finally, crucially: Was a carefully distilled approximation of
    earnestness really all that made ""Houses on the Hill"" better than
    ""You're Still the One""?</p><p>
    
    Guess what: Slow Dazzle-- named for a John Cale album, but better
    known as two-thirds of second-tier indie-pop group Mendoza Line--
    don't provide any definitive answers. Still, at least they're throwing
    out a few hints. Core duo Shannon McArdle and Timothy Bracy like their
    rustic vocals and saloon songwriting ensconced in dreamy electronics
    and ProTools psychedelia, courtesy of third member and producer Peter
    Langland-Hassan: backwards guitars, dirge-like drum machines,
    atmospheric synths. The Mekons' Sally Timms has charted a similar
    course in her solo work. In a word, it's art-country, and the
    underlying urban/rural dichotomy neatly befits Slow Dazzle's
    Brooklyn-via-Georgia roots.</p><p>
    
    Over a sparse eight songs, <em>The View From the Floor</em>
    continues the male/female point-counterpoint of recent Mendoza Line
    records. McArdle's wavering twang opens the disc on the lush,
    elliptical ""Fleur de Lis"", the album's least country moment. McCardle's
    ""Wedding Dance"" is the strongest original song here, a typically
    desperate Appalachian ballad dressed up with hints of piano and
    cavernous synth strings. Bracy-penned ""The Extent of My Remarks"" lets
    her wax goofily morbid-- pushing lovers down stairs, running off with
    women, suiciding-- but though her vocals call to mind a less-tuneful
    Neko Case, the depravity never really goes anywhere. Bracy, for his
    part, struggles to affect the grizzled, off-key knowingness of Bob
    Dylan or a folksier Lou Reed. He alludes to Coen Brothers films and
    unjudiciously employs extended judicial metaphors. ""There's nothing
    more ridiculous than a man chasing his hat,"" he wheezes, ""except
    perhaps a man chasing a girl like you.""</p><p>
    
    All of which brings us to that final question: What, other than aging
    newspapermen's personal biases (now too easily derided as ""rockism"")
    made certain alt-country more affecting than most mainstream
    country-pop? I submit, exactly what literary critic Martin Amis has
    tirelessly championed in his own chosen purview: talent. You can
    become rich without talent, famous without talent, but you can't
    become talented without talent, Amis writes. So we do away with
    talent: The author of <em>Hannibal</em> is hailed as Pulitzer-worthy;
    the likes of Shania receive unironic accolades (patience, Brooks &amp;
    Dunn).</p><p>
    
    Alas, it is in this nebulous quality-- talent-- that Slow Dazzle's
    efforts here ultimately prove deficient. A halting, unexceptional
    Leonard Cohen cover stands leagues above anything else on the disc.
    There's no shame in a well-executed cover, but Slow Dazzle's ""Anthem""
    is no match for Johnny Cash's ""Bird on a Wire"", the suddenly
    unfashionable Jeff Buckley's ""Hallelujah"", or-- if we may expand
    beyond Cohen-- Uncle Tupelo's ""No Depression"".</p></div>"|7815.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7815-the-view-from-the-floor/|5.8|Marc Hogan

On first listen, Sufjan Stevens' latest installment of state-based chamber-folk, <em>Illinois</em>, sounds dangerously similar to 2003's <em>Michigan</em>, all chirping vocals and copious orchestration.  Both records inadvertently validate East Coast stereotypes of tough Midwestern values: This is earnest, hard-working music, morally rooted and technically precise.</p><p>Still, Stevens has always been a folk singer more in theory than in practice.  He routinely ditches folk's scrappy, stripped-down aesthetics, but consistently embraces its stories-of-the-people unanimity.  Consequently, <em>Illinois</em> is less about place than spirit.  Stevens dutifully celebrates and indicts all the appropriate landmarks, isolating the highest and lowest points in Illinois history, but at its best, the album makes America feel very small and very real: A boy crying in a van, a girl with bone cancer, stepmothers, parades, bandstands, presidents, UFOs, cream of wheat, trains after dark, a serial killer, Bible study.</p><p>Musically, <em>Illinois</em> is strange and lush, as excessive and challenging as its giant, gushing song titles. Despite employing a small army of backers (including a string quartet, the Illinoisemaker Choir, drummer James McAllister, trumpeter Craig Montoro, and a pile of extra vocalists), Stevens is more forefronted than on the comparably solo <em>Seven Swans</em>. Manning nearly every instrument in his arsenal (and some beyond-- Stevens recorded the piano parts at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn), Stevens conducts his friends with impressive grace.  Stevens' pipes quiver generously; his vocals could be easily (perhaps accurately) read as precious, but they're really more intimate than emo, and always beautifully echoed by his backers.</p>
<p>The colossal ""The Black Hawk War"" cartwheels slowly into a climax of strings and horns, gurgling and pushing, ostensibly signifying (with much aplomb) the violent return of the Sac and Fox Indians to Illinois.  Stevens may be deploying state propaganda, or validating Black Hawk's push home, but no matter how grave its reality, the moment still lands like a giant, neon-cased WELCOME TO ILLINOIS billboard.  Trumpets blare, submission looms, our eyes widen, it makes sense: Illinois. Is. The. Greatest. State. Of. All. TIME!</p>
<p>The excellent ""Casimir Pulaski Day"" (named after an Illinois state holiday honoring the polish-born victor of the Battle of Brandywine) is a heartbreaking story of late winter death, bravely sung over rich banjo; the bubbly ""Decatur"" (the title of which is, awesomely, rhymed with ""alligator,"" ""aviator,"" and ""emancipator"") features one of Stevens' most undeniable melodies, the kind of pretty, tinkling cue that sends everyone in earshot twirling through the streets, jazz hands and all.  Matthew Morgan yelps solid backing bits (see their gorgeously squeaky harmony on ""Stephen A. Douglass was a great debater/ But Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator!""), while Daniel and Elin Smith (of Brother Danielson, and the Danielson Famile) chime in for a campfire finish, complete with self-applause.</p>
<p>Stevens has a remarkable habit of being rousing and distressing at the same time, prodding disparate emotional centers until it's unclear whether it's best to grab your party shoes or a box of tissues.  The gut-punching ""Chicago"" cagily celebrates the innate (and deeply American) tendency to employ highways as escape routes, ditching old mistakes for new swatches of land, new plates of eggs, new parking lots. Impossibly propulsive, each calm, harmonized, Illinoisemaker cry of ""All things go!"" pushes harder, promising liberation, by death or by automobile: ""If I was crying/ In the van with my friend/ It was for freedom/ From myself and from the land,"" Stevens chokes, voice shaking over a haze of drums, strings, and shimmering keyboards.</p>
<p>""John Wayne Gacy, Jr."" traces, with alarming accuracy, and over a hazy swirl of acoustic guitar and piano, the pathology of Illinois' most infamous serial killer: From 1972 until his arrest in 1978, Gacy was responsible for the torture, rape, and murder of 33 boys and young men, many of whom were discovered buried under the floorboards of his Norwood Park home. Lyrically, Stevens nails the specifics (as a kid, Gacy was slammed in the head by a swing, resulting in a blackout-inducing blood clot in his brain; he routinely donned a clown suit to entertain at a local hospital; victims were typically immobilized with chloroform-soaked cloths), and shifts perspectives gracefully; anchored in first-person, the song's narrator prods Gacy's mother and father, his neighbors, his victims, himself. More than any other track here, ""Gacy"" highlights Stevens' literary prowess, perfectly packed with nuance and detail.</p>
<p>At seventy-four minutes, <em>Illinois</em> is an exercise in patience; considering how long it takes to dog paddle through all the gooey orchestration, chugging through Stevens' meticulous arrangements and parsing out the melodies, <em>Illinois</em> is a bit of a commitment. Its 21 tracks consist of a handful of transitional snippets (many arresting in their own right), and plenty of good stuff (""The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulder"", in particular) is buried way in the back, rewarding those who persevere, and in both theory and execution, <em>Illinois</em> is huge, a staggering collection of impeccably arranged American tribute songs.</p></div>"|7514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7514-illinois/|9.2|Amanda Petrusich

A significant break from Jamie Lidell's prior work both as a solo laptop artist on Warp and as one half of Super_Collider (Chilean techno terrorist Christian Vogel carries the other half of that amulet), its breezy soul had me dreaming up back stories. Maybe these were all guest vocalists. Maybe Warp's promobot purposely mislabelled some old Stax record to put me off the scent. Maybe Lidell did some Logic voodoo on a vault of old soul reels and repurposed a bunch of lesser-heard Motown gems to fit a glitchier, Warp-friendly palette.</p><p>
    
    The real answer was simpler than that. Nearly five years in the making, <em>Multiply</em> represents Lidell's dramatic transformation from a knob-twiddling laptopper to a red-blooded soul singer. Where Lidell's prior solo work enjoyed a well-earned reputation for being difficult and forbidding, <em>Multiply</em> is among the most accessible records Warp has ever released. Backed by instrumentation from the likes of Berlinite squatters such as Mocky and Gonzales, and fleshed out by Lidell's robust, full-bodied voice, <em>Multiply</em> has the spirit of classic Motown and Stax. Whether in the breezy, sun-drenched title track, the soulful creep of ""This Time"" or the closing ballad ""Game For Fools"", it's obvious that Lidell isn't afraid of channeling (or repeating) history.</p><p>
    
    But while the song structures and Lidell's vocal style owe boatloads to the 60s and 70s, there's also a modern programming style at work here that separates him from modern day revivalists like, say, Sharon Jones. Listen to <em>Multiply</em> once and you'll be struck by how reverent it is; listen to it three times and you'll start to notice the microscopic digital artifacts and subtle tweaks that give it personality and pop. For all the talk about it being a throwback record, it's also true that a handful of these tracks probably couldn't have been made in 1995, much less '65. The wet funk of first single ""When I Come Around"" takes glitchy liberties with its percussion track and includes a stunning middle-8 where Lidell's vocal gets chopped, sliced and sprinkled over a merry-go-round; the goofy ""A Little Bit More"" sounds like nu-soul run through a slapstick plugin; the delirious funk of ""Newme"" is a nine-layer cake of boom-bap, Rhodes and horns, about six levels of which had to have been built after the fact, in the studio, on a computer.</p><p>
    
    Anyway, if the Maximo Park record wasn't enough to signify the end of days for the Warp of old, this should do the trick. Not just because it's one of the label's most commercially viable releases in forever, but because it goes to great lengths to lovingly namecheck the very strands of soul (i.e. Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Stevie Wonder, etc.) that the old Warp very fastidiously avoided. While I'm not sure that people have as strong a sense of brand loyalty to Warp anymore, this is probably still going to go down in electronic music circles as one of the year's most polarizing records. But don't let the naysayers keep you from hearing this before the winter rolls around; boasting 10 gorgeous songs over a trim 40 minutes, this is exactly the kind of record you need in your summer.</p></div>"|4777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4777-multiply/|8.5|Mark Pytlik

Theirs is a natural-- if perhaps not exactly blessed-- union, and together these four musicians (Nate and Brian of Mouthus, Mike and Maya of Double Leopards) opt to abandon the typical rock-based topography of sequential peaks, valleys and foothills in exchange for denser, more inert terrain that breathes and swells like a pulsating carpet of pine needles.</p><p> 
    
    Containing two 20-plus minute (or sidelong, vinyl fans might say) tracks, <em>Tarpit</em> rivals Thuja and other acts from the Jewelled Antler collective in its ability to transform its assortment of electronically sourced sounds into organic solids so amorphously plant-like that one could swear the structure of these pieces varies from one listen to the next.</p><p>
    
    If forced to referee White Rock's constructions, I'd have to raise the glove of Double Leopards in a close decision, as the fragrant musk of <em>Tarpit</em> bears closer resemblance to the elliptical, droning suspensions of the Leopards' 2003 <em>Halve Maen</em> than to the crazed, unmoored electricity of previous Mouthus works like their 2004 Ecstatic Peace album Loam. But these untitled tracks clearly retain the apparent footprints of all participants, and the album's opening minutes do consist of a gauzy, rather Loam-like fabric of sculpted feedback.</p><p>
    
    Before long, further indistinct elements of percussion and electronics emerge as gradually and imperceptibly as a wave of heat stroke, and by its halfway point this first track has settled into a tentative womblike pulse. Distant vocal mirages briefly materialize (or do they?) and then submit to the type of steady, humid rhythms one might expect to hear upon discovering a sinister factory conducting mysterious operations deep in the forest primeval.</p><p>
    
    Unnamed track number two opens upon friendlier environs, its ambient swells of keyboards almost deciding upon a melody or two before dissipating into the itchy fog. Though this piece initially betrays no forward movement as such, periodic stretches of coordinated silence and opaque momentum shifts manage to help the music avoid utter stagnation. Likewise <em>Tarpit</em> also displays White Rock's tasteful, patient restraint as they forgo any cheap, perfunctory blasts of loose noise. So much so, in fact, that increasing the volume only manages to make the album sound somehow thicker rather than louder, a fact that makes <em>Tarpit</em> a particularly difficult listen when, say, your dishwasher is running.</p><p>
    
    And as with many such non-choreographed documents of form-shifting improv, <em>Tarpit</em> can engender a peculiar anxiety in its listeners. Are these recordings truly representative of White Rock at peak form, or might the group have taken these pieces somewhere even farther on the next night, or the next? Would additional voices have enhanced or hindered this album's vaporous, mesmeric appeal? For the moment, however, we'll assume these questions can be answered in <em>Tarpit</em>'s favor, and simply relish it for the nonchalantly captivating success that it appears now to be.</p></div>"|8792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8792-tarpit/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

So yeah, Portland, Oregon's The Planet The are essentially Devo disciples, but their music is as carnal as it is calculated. Sounds like Brainiac, you say? Well, yeah, but The Planet The are more aptly framed rather than pigeonholed, falling squarely in the middle of the Devo-Brainiac spectrum.</p><p>
    Unlike those other bands, TPT have a handful of infectious indie pop melodies, albeit ones mucked up by sputtering time signatures, clamorous sound effects, and squawking vocals. The Planet The seem more prone to backbreaking frenzy than pristine new wave pop-- they're more Hella than ""Hella Good"". Song structures seldom derail completely, but rather jar loose from the track before pulling everything together for an anthemic chorus hook. ""Wet Dust"" begins relatively clean cut with man and synthesizer in bubbly unison before the song spontaneously devolves into pathological moaning and dizzying chromatic guitar riffs. To the rescue comes the a massive refrain-- synths blaring, vocals straining, and drums raising Cain.</p><p>
    This unstable formula pays dividends on standout track ""Please Don't Kill Myself"", combining rickety Pere Ubu time signatures with morbid paranoia á la the Unicorns. The track single-handedly propels The Planet The beyond new wave quacks like Numbers and Dynasty, bands that still struggle to affix feasible vocals to their fractured, over-baked instrumentation. Similarly, ""Please Don't Kill Myself"" does lose momentum on its protracted bridge, but the catchy staccato verse synth reemerges from the rubble and lulls the listener back into lo-fi pop euphoria.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, <em>You Absorb My Vision</em> wears off its already porous pop coating by the album's final third. Back-to-back numbers ""Free Jewelry"" and ""Tighten Your Dreams"" hiss and snarl like morose Cex tirades, justifying reviewers' shackling of The Planet The to many unseasoned Tigerbeat6 rock acts. Still, even weaker late tracks ""Tennis"" and ""Envision My Zorb"" sport some nifty musical ideas, albeit less polished and fully integrated ones. They may be poking around in niches already claimed by previous bands, but these new wave dweebs got the smarts to pull it off without provoking wedgies, swirlies and/or petty lunch money theft from bullying traditionalists.</p></div>"|6576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6576-you-absorb-my-vision/|7.3|Adam Moerder

    album. For newer listeners, it should be stressed that young Bill
    Callahan was very different from the mellow miniaturist of
    <em>Supper</em> and <em>A River Ain't Too Much to Love</em>. This is Smog
    at his lo-fiest and no-waviest, his most misogynistic and malicious.
    If you dislike the bookends of <em>Accumulation: None</em>, the
    distortion-drenched echo chamber ""Astronaut"" and the toneless no-fi
    dirge ""Hole in the Heart"", you should steer clear of <em>Forgotten
    Foundation</em>. But if you find those songs strangely magnetic for
    their sheer contrariness, and wonder how the competent, tranquil Smog
    of today earned his reputation for musical and lyrical malice, you'd
    do well to begin here.</p><p>
    
    If you could get the taciturn singer to give a reason for deliberately
    releasing evil into the world, it's probable that the answer would
    come as a shrug: Because it is possible to do so. What are we to make
    of ""Evil Tyrant""? ""He saw the most beautiful girl on the island/ He
    knew that raping her was not the best way to impress her,"" Smog
    deadpans over a primitive beat and disjointed guitar runs. Or the
    sneered innuendo of the crashing ""97th Street"": ""Put a little bit of
    the city right in your mouth."" Is this social satire, or is Smog just
    an unsavory character? Why do we tend to interperet such stuff more favorably when it comes dressed in indie sackcloth instead of pop velour?
    Does he mean it, or is he investigating possibilities of expression
    simply because they exist? Even if they aren't confessional, what
    drives a person to make up such mean-spirited stories without the
    mitigating factor of moral judgment?</p><p>
    
    Charitably, one imagines that Smog is bravely magnifying aspects of
    his psyche that many artists, in their quest to be liked, conceal, and
    that these are exactly the sort of questions his nastier efforts are
    intended to raise. Less charitably, he's just mean, and while
    one wants to group him with Bret Easton Ellis, Michel Houellebecq, and
    the Frogs, it's quite possible that the distinction between this
    camp's misanthropy and 50 Cent's is specious. While some of the songs
    have intrinsic musical interest-- ""Guitar Innovator"" is a gem, as Smog
    tape-splices heavily distorted vocal ejaculations into a sort of
    monstrously thrumming rhythmic engine-- many seek no end but dread,
    or, at best, an interested repulsion. It's the ""why"" and ""should"" of
    its existence that make <em>Forgotten Foundation</em> compelling, more
    of a theoretical gambit than a confessional one. We hope. </p></div>"|7287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7287-forgotten-foundation/|6.0|Brian Howe

I've never been, but in an era of shrinking club attendance (at least in the English-speaking world), the fact that they seem to be growing means they must be doing something right. That ""something"" is probably appealing to an utterly devoted yet wide audience. Optimo's founders and residents, JD Twitch and JG Wilkes, play everything from moldy old funk tracks to modern indie to hardcore acid to ragga dancehall.</p><p>
    But before you recoil in horror at the thought of even more post-2 Many  DJ's whimsy: they don't do mashups, they aren't into incongruous blends for their own sake (Ciara + Rednex...wheeee!), and they don't front like crossing genre and decade borders is reinventing the wheel. They just know what good DJs have known since Francis Grasso started blending funk and rock as a cruising soundtrack. Like the sampled Primal Scream preacher dude said, they know music is music. And if you're really good, you can blend it all and keep the floor filled all night.</p><p>
    The Grasso reference isn't just me showing off what a knowledgeable guy I am. (Okay, maybe a little.) Way before 3/4ths of you (and me) were even alive, Grasso invented disco mixing by blending heavy rock and heavy funk (Santana, JB, War, etc.) for a rabid audience of newly sexually liberated future yuppies, guppies, and buppies. While <em>Psyche Out</em> contains plenty of music beyond Grasso's reach (everything that came after Giorgio Moroder, for instance), any mix that opens with Hawkwind and the Silver Apples and climaxes with the Chambers Brothers must capture a little of his feeling.
    </p><p>
    Coming less than a year after their <em>How to Kill the DJ Pt. 2</em> mix, <em>Psyche Out</em> is indeed heavy. <em>HTKTDJ2</em> (phew) was impossibly flashy and virtuosic-- all jump cuts between scene, sound, and mood. <em>Psyche Out</em> is less manic, more roiling, brooding, cosmic. If anything unites the 40 years of music here, it's the compulsive, hypnotic power of repetition. From psyche rock to krautrock to disco to acid house to our own cannibalistic little fin de sicle, the tribe vibe of dancing your ass off in a dark, smoky room (or zoning out) (though that takes us dangerously close to Lazer Floyd territory so best to keep moving) still trumps doing coke in the bathroom and ""networking.""
    </p>
<p>
    The middle section is one big throb. Acid (and the proto-acidic industrial that preceded it) has lost none of its futuristic blankness (those gnomic, endlessly circling riffs) and post-Atari jungle rite abandon. (The urge to strip naked and smear yourself with raw hamburger while envisioning yourself as an extra in <em>Tron</em>, in other words.) In its original form, Herbie Hancock's ""Raindance"" fires disembodied bleeps from a synthesizer the size of your couch into an inky black void (of the ""space, the final frontier"" sort). Here the Optimo boys direct those bleeps into the sticky center of Sweet Exorcist's ""Mad Jack"", an odd bit of gray techno-exotica, like if someone had dumped a rain forest into the middle of Sheffield.
    </p>
<p>
    Carl Craig puts 21st century rims on the perverted Eurodisco of Throbbing Gristle's ""Hot on the Heels of Love"", but it barely needs them. (Sleazy disco, ironic or otherwise, transcends time and place, I guess.) And I have to admit I did a little ""woo!"" when they mixed up the Stranglers' ""Bear Cage"" with the ""giant ball bearings in the titular device"" beats of Mr. Fingers' ""Washing Machine"". Norman Whitfield's ""psychedelic soul"" productions for the Temptations helped usher disco into existence (really, no shit, <em>The Wire</em> told me so), and ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"" is like trying to escape a black hole of molasses, all baritone gravitas and string melodrama. So they mix it into Koenig Cylinder's ""Carousel"", which is like being sucked into some kinda space tornado, all milky way swirls at top speed. (Sorry I'm getting so ridiculous simile crazy here, but the last twenty minutes of this mix are maybe the most exciting thing I've heard this year.)
    </p>
<p>
    There's something similarly tornado-like about the drums on Dinosaur's ""Kiss Me Again"", which bring us back down to earth in time for Johnny Cash, winking at us silly disco bunnies from beyond the grave, to gently see us on our way. There's nothing remotely ""2005"" (you know, 50 Cent, Iraq, pornographic hamburger commercials) about any of this, but, hey, weren't we all supposed to have evolved into silicon-based lifeforms by now anyway? Or be dancing on the cinder following nuclear doomsday? There's just something heartening about the fact that we're still even mucking around in these meat bags, dancing to heavy repetitive music, doing lots of drugs, and enjoying that moment when the humid weather matches the humid music. Or laying on the floor staring into space. If you must.

    Holiday's art has hardened around the grim facts of her biography. 
    She's 
    a primary figure in the Cult of Pain pantheon, alleged proof that the 
    black coal of bad circumstances and poor choices can sometimes be 
    compressed into an artistic diamond. Her signature song was ""Lady Sings 
    the Blues"", and while she preferred to think of her work in the tradition of smooth, sophisticated 
    pop, her life was filled with sadness from the beginning. Still a 
    teenager when she first dabbled in heroin and prostitution, Holiday was 
    a successful singer in her early 20s and died before reaching 50. We're 
    told about the suffering inside her weary phrasing and when she 
    delivered a line like ""I'd rather my man would hit me then for him to 
    jump up and quit me"" and ""I swear I won't call no copper if I'm beat up 
    by my poppa"" in ""'Taint Nobody's Business if I Do"", we remember her 
    destructive taste in lovers and the never-ending string of abusive 
    relationships. The words she croaked on the <em>Lady in Satin</em> album, 
    recorded a few months before her death, are received as an epitaph.</p><p>
    
    It wasn't always so. As heard in the early tracks on this 2xCD/DVD 
    collection, when she was just a kid fronting pianist Teddy Wilson's 
    band 
    she sang with infectious energy and a child's enthusiasm. ""What a 
    Little 
    Moonlight Can Do"" from 1935 is a joyous up-tempo floor-filler and 
    Holiday sounds silly but self-aware, one step away from leaving the 
    bandstand and joining the party herself. At this point she hadn't yet 
    developed her extreme behind-the-beat lag (a quality Miles Davis 
    claimed 
    as an influence) but the timbre of her unmistakable voice was intact. 
    ""I 
    Cried for You"" from the following year is a bit slower but no less 
    buoyant, and the mid-tempo ballad ""Mean to Me"" from 1937, though about 
    a 
    deadbeat boyfriend, is delivered with sass and humor.</p><p>
<em>The Ultimate Collection</em> deserves credit for assembling tracks from a 
    number of different labels, allowing us to hear the changes in style 
    and 
    approach from year to year. Holiday's music got heavier by the late 
    30s, 
    the time of the darkly brilliant allegory ""Strange Fruit"" and ""God 
    Bless 
    the Child"". This period through the mid-40s is when Holiday 
    recorded 
    her most famous sides, including ""Billie's Blues"", ""Don't Explain"", and 
    ""Good Morning Heartache.""</p><p>
    
    The second disc begins with Holiday getting the string section she 
    always wanted, the sweetness of the orchestrations serving as a 
    steadily 
    contrasting frame to her deteriorating voice. Songs like ""You're My 
    Thrill"" and ""Crazy He Calls Me"" have a disturbing gothic quality as 
    Holiday sounds aged beyond her years, and on spare ballads in front of 
    a 
    small combo like ""Detour Ahead"" and ""It Had to Be You"" she seems aware 
    of her tragic stature as she drifts off pitch and never sounds 
    convincing expressing warmer sentiments. By the time of the sole <em>Lady 
    in 
    Satin</em> selection ""I'm a Fool to Want You"" she sounds exhausted, like 
    someone who wants to lay down for a long, long time. The heavy reverb 
    on 
    her voice and the lush strings are weird and disorienting, almost an 
    attempt to throw her shortcomings to sharp relief. A few months later 
    she was gone.</p></div>"|4014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4014-the-ultimate-collection/|9.6|Mark Richardson

It was 1962, and busloads of Freedom Riders were still fresh in the minds of conservative white southerners, a fact that made the trip harrowing for the Hitsville recording artists whom label founder Berry Gordy had packaged together for the revue. Gordy's intent was to build the brand of Motown, get the word into people's heads, get them thinking not just about the next Miracles or Marvelettes single, but about the next single coming out on Motown, no matter what it was.  But his timing in that summer brought an inadvertent association with the Civil Rights movement to the label. Here was a black-owned record label with a mostly black roster of artists exhibiting its wares in the heart of a region that was trying its hardest to send these very people to the margins of society and keep them there-- it was inspiring to many, even if Gordy's only real intent was to sell more records and score some hits on the pop chart.</p><p>
    
    Of course he succeeded in that, and Motown today is a word people use like Kleenex or Xerox, a brand name so iconic that it came to define an entire aesthetic sensibility and style of songwriting. No one talks about the Vee Jay Records sound the same way no one asks you to hand them a Puffs before sneezing-- Motown simply towered over all of its independent brethren for about two decades, and the Hitsville song factory set the gold standard for 60s r&amp;b.; By 1962, Motown's fourth year of operation, the hits were a regular occurrence and Gordy had established an artist development department to coach his growing stable of performers, most of whom were barely in their early 20s at that point, if they were even that old. It would be a few years until the label itself was firmly ensconced in the collective American consciousness, but as the second volume in Hip-O Select's <em>Complete Motown Singles</em> series proves, the label already had a signature sound and an almost universally high quality level on its releases.</p><p>
    
    Pleasures abound on the four discs of singles and B-sides compiled here, including numerous smashes you can still hear on the radio on any given day.  Marvin Gaye progresses from a genuinely bizarre version of ""Mr. Sandman"", full of spooky vibes and queasy backing vocals, to his first taste of success with ""Stubborn Kind of Fellow"", whose opening chorus of ""Say yeah, yeah, yeah"" is one of the easiest instructions to follow in recorded song. By the end of the set, Marvin's on to ""Hitch Hike"" and stardom, which is the kind of thing that makes it easy to forget that these discs only cover a single year of the label's output.</p><p>
    
    Gaye's nascent stardom was nothing at that point relative to that of the Marvelettes, the Miracles, and Mary Wells, all of whom have their moments here. It's almost impossible to believe that Smokey Robinson's perfect ""You've Really Got a Hold on Me""-- a song that's since become one of the true standards of the rock 'n' roll era-- was originally a B-side, but that's how spoiled the label was for quality material by then. Robinson also wrote Mary Wells' ""Two Lovers"", which mixes sly humor perfectly with a nuanced vocal and that airy production style that today can only be called the Motown sound.</p><p>
    
    New arrivals at the label that year included two who would soon be among Motown's biggest stars: Martha Reeves (with the Vandellas) and Little Stevie Wonder, at the time only 12 years old.  Even then, Wonder was an outstanding harmonica player and a strong singer who sounds significantly beyond his years on ""I Call It Pretty Music but the Old People Call It the Blues"". Both the Supremes and the Temptations had a prolific year in the studio, but both were still searching for a breakout hit. The Supremes' ""Your Heart Belongs to Me"", a beguiling letter to a soldier from the girl he left back home, probably should have been huge, but only managed to scrape the bottom of the chart despite the wide reach of its subject matter in an era of massive military buildup and increasing entanglement in Southeast Asia.</p><p>
    
    Just as with the first volume of the series, there are dozens of tracks with no other logical home that nonetheless deserve a listen. The Temptations' ""Isn't She Pretty"" is a crazy doo-wop song with Eddie Kendricks flying around in Frankie Valli territory with bass Melvin Franklin trucks away down at the bottom. The eccentric Gino Parks gets in a hypercharged, shouting performance on ""Fire"", backed by the full force of the Hitsville house band horn section, while Mike &amp; the Modifiers' sole single, ""I Found Myself a Brand New Baby"", is an ultra-catchy bit of blue-eyed soul that excellent liners correctly peg as a premonition of the British Invasion.</p><p>
    
    And it goes on from there. The Contours rock hard on ""Do You Love Me?,"" Eddie Holland turns in a handful of great vocal performances that make you wonder why his career as a singer never took off the way his career as a writer did, and you even get a bit of Grieg-referencing jazz on the Earl Washington All-Stars' ""Opus No. 3"". And that's the real brilliance of this series-- laying out the Motown singles discography in its entirety, warts and all, gives you a picture of an era you could never piece together just by listening to the hits. Even in its early stages, Motown was a force to reckon with, and on this set you can hear the language changing, expanding just enough to include the word Motown and all of its associations.</p></div>"|2065.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2065-the-complete-motown-singles-vol-2-1962/|9.1|Joe Tangari

The record
    paid homage to krautrock mainstays Can and Kraftwerk while dishing
    out thick, dissonant arrangements. In a
    nutshell: All music-dork killer, no hipness-jaded filler. Reductive,
    yeah, but the band earned the comparisons-as-compliments: ""Caesar's
    Column"" was the best song since, like, ""Clocks"". It rocked, was
    anthemic, and had the lacerating guitars and intricate arrangement to
    make Hella kid wet himself.</p><p>
    The Oneida of <em>The Wedding</em> are much less eager to please. The new
    full-length is playfully scatterbrained, careening from shamanic,
    drone-backed narcotics (""The Eiger"", ""Charlemagne"") to hypnotic
    rockers (""Lavender"", ""You're Drifting""). I'm no longer convinced
    Oneida are happy to master favorite band referentiality. I mean, it's
    like they're settling into their own, profoundly complex voice,
    content to ride out any turbulence along the way. Stubborn kids.</p><p>
    Just settling in? On this, their seventh album? Precisely. Any band
    willing to mess with self-exploration at this point in their career
    have either got nothing to lose or plan on sticking around. Having
    established a sizable following, Oneida would be jerks to call this
    their swan song when there's this collection of vibrant, unexplored
    tributaries begging to be rafted down. ""The Eiger"" laces grunting,
    polyrhythmic strings under nightingale vocals with palpable feeling.
    ""Lavender"" evokes Boredoms and Parts &amp; Labor in its organ atmospheres
    and steady snare slams while tucking in a slyly harmonious vocal.
    Tuneful vocals, wha? I thought this was soupy psych-rock hour?</p><p>
    Well, technically it still is. But gone here is the Glass-ian stoicism
    of the band's erstwhile material. In its strongest moments, The
    Wedding balances emotionally vulnerability atop card-houses of
    mind-numbing repetition. Only ""Spirits"", which capitulates to white
    guy sitar fetish á la ""The End"" and ""Did I Die""-- the album's
    requisite random primal scream therapy-- feel out of place. This isn't
    a new Oneida, but a veteran band fortified for the long haul. Brooklyn
    prides itself on its intrepid tyros-- by its longevity standards,
    Oneida are a veritable high-school sweetheart story. Hopefully come
    2015 they'll still be pwnin' noobs.</p></div>"|6001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6001-the-wedding/|7.4|Sam Ubl

Led by Paul Westerberg, who yearned for high notes more often than he actually hit them, they gave voice to all those knotty emotions that overwhelmed your 16-year-old self. Any band can do that, but Westerberg sang with the benefit of hindsight, and the message he sent from his twenties was crucial and reassuring; all those bursting, longing feelings were worthwhile and even useful out in the real world. In fact, the Replacements presented that emotional confusion as a kind of moral code with which the world could be understood, a compass with which to navigate life's disappointments and tragedies. Heard at the right age, this band truly could be your life.</p><p>
    
    On his first collection of post-Replacements material, <em>Besterberg: The Best of Paul Westerberg</em> (which is a great title and begs a companion rarities comp called <em>Resterberg</em>), the former Replacement no longer sounds like a teenager in a twentysomething body. He's resolutely adult, more mature and perhaps more cautious of the world. He gives himself over completely to the na-na-na's on the ""cutesy"" (his word, not mine) ""Dyslexic Heart"" and the piss-and-vinegar of ""World Class Fad"", but Westerberg sings songs like ""Runaway Wind"" and ""Love Untold"" from a distance, a mere observer rather than a participant. Even the B-side ""Man Without Ties"", about spending Friday night with a frozen pizza, seems to be about someone else. ""A Star Is Bored"" (ironically, from the <em>Friends soundtrack) trades adolescent disaffection for celebrity disaffection-- maybe Winona digs it, but the rest of us can't really identify with four-star hotel anomie.</em></p><p>
    
    There are, however, a few moments on <em>Besterberg when Westerberg deftly captures that sense of youthful confusion: On ""Stain Your Blood"" he sings ""Stay the night just for fun"" with the desperation either of a kid whose parents are away for the weekend or of an adult who really doesn't want to face the morning alone. His characters are essentially the same no matter how many years separate them, but searching for the boy inside the man proves much more fruitful for Westerberg than finding the adult in the boy. On ""Love Untold"" he sings of a young romance that ends before it starts, but besides the grinding guitar solo, the song sounds saccharine.</em></p><p>
    
    Amazingly, <i>Besterberg</i> works better as an album than his first three proper albums. Not only does it reject the worsterberg, but it also presents its own solid story of high hopes and low pay-off. The first half of the album finds him playing it relatively safe, perhaps in a bid for post-Replacements respectability (and who doesn't deserve it more?), but as <i>14 Songs</i> and <em>Eventually tank, he grows pricklier and his music sounds rawer and more inhabited, his trajectory mirroring that of his idol, Alex Chilton.</em></p><p>
    
    This prickliness becomes Westerberg, even when he assumes his Grandpaboy persona. As a result, <em>Besterberg gets better as it proceeds and as Westerberg grows more comfortable just left of the spotlight. ""Let the Bad Times Roll"" roils with offhanded resignation, and he sings ""What a Day (for a Night)"" with the dreamy sigh of someone who can't believe his dumb luck. On ""All That I Had"", which was inexplicably relegated to B-side status, Westerberg erases any distance between himself and the song and explains himself better than anyone else can: ""Didn't follow my dreams/ I lost the map/ I lived my fantasy instead/ Until I found it was a trap/ Gave a life, got a living/ Hey, that's all right, all's forgiven.""</em></p></div>"|8634.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8634-besterberg-the-best-of-paul-westerberg/|6.9|Stephen M.

    while (or
    the meta thing), so forgive me: During my two month riff in Rome, I 
    sacked the
    eternal city for the real what have you's-- what real Italians wear, 
    where real
    Italians hang out at night, how real Italians ride real Italian 
    scooters.
    Three-button collared party shirts are the hot shit, but one arm in I 
    realized
    I didn't have the chest hair. So the rest of the summer I stuck to 
    wearing ""I
    Survived the Pantheon"" tees and having my wallet stolen-- tourist 
    stuff,
    comfortable but me.</p><p>
    
    Diplo does the tourist thing too-- obviously there's some give/take 
    w/r/t how
    much control he has over that-- but beginning-to-end he approaches 
    baile funk
    with, vaguely we'll say, hip-hop sensibilities. (Or better, 
    Hollertronix
    sensibilities, where bass, Dirty South, Baltimore, and ""Sweet Dreams"", 
    among
    others, peacefully co-exist.) Baile funk aka favela funk aka funk 
    has been
    doing the crazy Portuguese screaming over Miami bass and U.S. pop kitsch 
    thing
    for decades now-- we're just finding out about it. The 
    tracks
    we're hearing on Diplo's through-the-backdoor mixes (his first trip to 
    Brazil
    yielded last year's <i>Favela On Blast</i>) aren't necessarily 
    groundbreaking
    or definitive for the genre (how would we know?), just the ones off 
    Diplo's
    Rio-bought comps he thought people'd dig. He liked the stuff simply by 
    how it
    sounded-- imagine that.</p><p>
    
    Track 5 (no song titles; more re: that in a sec) snatches something 
    from
    <i>Grease</i>, I think, and throws it back hi-ho silver digital cowboy, 
    etc.
    Then there's a part where all these dogs start barking-- always glad to 
    hear
    some of that. The sixth track has James Brown breaks, which I don't 
    remember
    from the other comps, so that's cool, and track 11 has a Prodigy line 
    on it.
    Track 15 samples a song I'm probably supposed to know; it's OK.</p><p>
    
    Other songs you may have heard in parts on Diplo's criminally 
    overlooked
    <i>Piracy Funds Terrorism Vol. 1</i> mixtape, which he put together 
    with Sri
    Lankan-via-London artist-singer M.I.A.. Which makes me wonder: If 
    there
    are baile tracks that we're hearing and saying ""Oh, this is an old 
    one,"" I can
    only imagine how these tracks fit into a current Rio set. Elsewhere 
    there's all
    the hora, rinkydink Italian wedding carmina, and crazy sing-scream MCs 
    whose
    sound falls somewhere between dancehall toasters and the grime kids. 
    Baile funk
    is ""make do with what you got"" music-- it's a fun dance at best (and 
    worst),
    hardly self-conscious to my ears, raw and celebratory in that amateur
    talent/lotta heart way whose spirit-- kill me-- I find strangely kin to 
    the
    good-precious side of American indie.</p><p>
    
    And god I hate to bring this up but: While there's some dubiously 
    transferrable
    hip-hop morality at work here with mixtapes copping songs that 
    themselves
    copped songs, Diplo's on some honest-to-badness culture-vulture shit 
    that
    understandably rubs dudes the wrong way. Worse, his no artist/no song 
    title
    thing might trick people into thinking ""It all sounds the same to 
    Diplo, he's
    overgeneralizing!"", which I think reflects more on the accuser than the
    accused. But 10 wrongs do make five rights, and if Diplo's shtick is 
    bringing
    this shanty to the world in a way they might respond to and ultimately 
    might
    take vested interest in (read: $$$), then let's drop the charges for 
    now and
    indulge the music as wide-eyed as he does.</p></div>"|2571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2571-favela-strikes-back/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

Right after the panoramic drums, driving guitar,     ecstatic synth trills, propulsive piano, and rapturous harmonies of     the title track, ""Until the Night Is Over"" treats us to six minutes of     lambent piano and M83's most negligible component-- the vocals. It's     innocuously pleasant, but squanders a track that could've been better     served by another remix. Boom Bip does a decent job of recasting     ""Don't Save Us From the Flames"" as instrumental indie-hop that     would've fit right in on his own last album. He drizzles disassociated     fragments of the source material into the back half, placing more     emphasis on his tweaky mechanical drums, electronic squiggles, and     tiny chimes, and his version seems more like a translation than a     remix.</p>
<p>It's Superpitcher's remix that extends this single's audience beyond     diehard collectors. Grabbing it by each end and stretching it like     electro-taffy for upwards of 10 minutes, Superpitcher isolates the     individual parts of ""Don't Save Us From the Flames"", opening up the     spaces between them so that each becomes a distinct rhythmic agent,     and expertly deploys them in a tense arc. The song's lean two-note     pulse and mammoth bass line ride a sultry house beat, and Anthony     Gonzalez's voice shimmers in the air. The Interpol-ish bridge puts in     a climactic appearance; ghost harmonies and guitar flourishes flit     through the mix, and by keeping the track stark, spacious and     incrementally shifting, Superpitcher creates an accurate exploded     diagram with a sensual impact that belies its clinical tone.</p>
<p><i>Teen Angst</i> is rounded out by a non-album track and a remix by     Montag (who should be intimately familiar with the source material,     having composed most of M83's string arrangements). ""Addicted to     Self-Mutilation"" is a generous seven minutes of ballroom electrofuzz,     a gorgeous if somewhat tepid wash of buried falsettos and mid-tempo,     morphing incandescence. This is the M83 of wafting, blissed-out     sonics, not the sharp dynamic shifts of their singles, and it     dovetails nicely with the Starsy neon pop of ""Teen Angst"". Montag     ratchets the ping-ponging synths of the original down to a soupier     growl, gives the vocals a little more breathing room, trims some     overdrive off of the chorus, and drops some of his trademarked     crystalline tones in the middle, but otherwise doesn't go very far in     re-imagining the track or revealing something about it that had been     hidden, the way Superpitcher seems to illuminate the viscera of ""Don't     Save Us from the Flames"".</p>

    beating. Dub
    is now seen as so essential to the history of late 20th century music
    that
    to question its importance feels almost heretical. Its brother, roots
    reggae, has suffered a bit from benign neglect, but its place in the
    canon
    is assured. (There's always a new generation of college kids buying
    Wailers'
    records for the first time.) Dancehall, of course, is at the peak of
    its
    hipster acclaim.</p><p>
    Ska was a hybrid of American r&amp;b;, jazz, and a burgeoning move towards
    traditional Jamaican music, which ska-core nonsense has leached out
    over the
    last two decades. Jamaican ska is indeed uptempo, and the
    2-Tone
    artists (like mods with their soul records) located the rave-up impulse
    lurking within. But the original ska was also music to work your hips
    to. By
    the time it found mass success, it was already slowing down to the
    swaying
    tempo of rocksteady and soon after that, reggae. It was also the birth
    of
    Jamaican music's enduring admixture of all-night dancing and social
    comment.</p><p>
<em>You Can Get It If You Really Want</em>, Trojan's excellent greatest-hits
    collection of the work of Desmond Dekker, captures all of this history
    and
    evolution on two CDs. It's also a mess of music, much of it
    transcendent
    and even the mediocre stuff still pretty good. Before Bob Marley,
    Dekker was
    perhaps the island's biggest music export, and he was huge star at
    home. He
    was a committed entertainer, but he also firmly believed that music had
    the
    power to uplift and educate.</p><p>
    The first three songs here-- ""Honour Your Father and Mother"",
    ""Parents"", and
    ""Labor For Learning""-- all extol the virtues of staying in school,
    listening
    to your folks, and getting good grades. With some nice brass and rhythm
    guitar to boot. The first went all the way to No. 1 in Jamaica, and soon he
    was
    rightfully calling himself the King of Ska, which provided the title of
    his
    next major hit, a smoking definition of the genre backed by the Maytals
    (under the name the Cherrypies).</p><p>
    Fired up by his own badass success, he injected a tougher than tough
    streak
    into his ""yes sir/yes ma'am"" persona and recorded ""007 (Shanty Town)"",
    an
    all-time rude boy anthem. In 1968, five years after he debuted as a
    polite
    young man, he released the gorgeous, numinous ""Israelites"", fraught
    with
    religious implications and sufferer's woe, as the music had slowed to
    the
    lilt of rocksteady on its way to reggae's rolling thunder
    fundamentalism. It
    went to No. 1 in the UK, and, more amazingly, made the top 10 in
    the
    U.S. These songs are the bedrock of Dekker's legend.</p><p>
    A charming, rinky-dink organ so irritating in the hands of later ska
    imitators shows up for a blip on ""Problems"". Dekker knows when not to
    let a
    sound wear out its welcome. This extends to the brevity of the songs
    themselves, a value crammed 31 on the first disc and 28 on the second.
    Many
    of the best tunes here barely clear the 2:30 mark. Dekker runs through
    a
    jaunty cover of the Beatles' ""Ob-la-di Ob-la-da"" (who do you think the
    ""Desmond"" in the song is?) and his generosity slips a bit of the
    haunting,
    gorgeous ""Wise Man"" on the outro. Blink and you'll miss it. So play it
    again.</p><p>
    On Disc 2, unexpected string flourishes play off the gentle ecstasy
    of
    Dekker's vocal on ""Perseverance""; if this is commercialization, then
    it's a
    kind I can appreciate. Jimmy Cliff's ""You Can Get It If You Really
    Want"" is
    such a classic it barely needs mentioning. Its sentiment may have been
    na\x95ve
    even by the early 70s, but I can't help but think we could still use a
    little of that positivity and self-belief today. Strings crop up on
    much of
    Dekker's early-70s work, product of his move to London, which marked a
    softening of his sound and (ironically) and end to the hits.</p><p>
    Dekker's fey, fluttering falsetto makes the softening superfluous. Like
    many
    of the great Jamaican vocalists, there's an unmistakable feminine
    quality to
    his voice that contrasts the baritone croak of the toaster. (Though if
    you're not expecting it, his hilarious Louis Armstrong impression on
    ""Live
    And Learn"" will knock you on your ass.) On ""Archie Wah Wah"", the
    strings get
    ditched for the bounce and Dekker floats back down to an earth where
    the
    girls are so plentiful (like gravel!) he can't help but holler at 'em.
    Plus
    he could still thrill instrumentally; the guitar on ""Warlock"" sounds
    like
    Morse code played on a clothesline.</p><p>
    The later work with his biggest fans the Specials is just making time,
    but
    there's no shame in retelling the story of how you climbed the tallest
    mountain if you actually made it up the damn thing. <em>You Can Get It</em>
    probably
    could have been trimmed back to a more listenable single disc. That
    disc is
    still lurking in here and it's one of the great Jamaican albums. How
    many of
    you can say the Beatles wrote a song about you?</p></div>"|2615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2615-you-can-get-it-if-you-really-want/|7.8|Jess Harvell

Providing the shortest ancestral link is cellist Beckie Foon, who has played with A Silver Mt. Zion and Set Fire to Flames, with pianist Spencer Krug (Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown, Frog Eyes) and mandolin player Rachel Levine (Cakelk) connected by slim degrees of separation as well. And though they utilize familiar ingredients, the trio's rigorous, European folk-inflected chamber music manages to sound quite distinct from anything else in their musical genealogy, resulting in this exquisite, understated pearl of a debut.</p><p>
    Given the high activity rate of all three group members-- Krug in particular is having himself one hell of a busy year-- their collaboration as Fifths of Seven risks seeming an afterthought or mere side project trifle, but there is no evidence on these eight collected pieces that anyone's talents have been spread too thin. Throughout the album the three each play with an intuitive delicacy that suggests many hours together in the rehearsal suite, with Levine's mandolin providing an earthy, vaguely Mediterranean air to dynamic compositions that can recall the small-ensemble works of Erik Satie, Gabriel Fauré, or contemporary acts like Rachel's.</p><p>
    On many of their best tracks here, such as the opening ""Rosa Centrifolia"" or the stately ""Echoes From a Wandered Path"", the music functions without a true center, as each instrument moves continually and transparently from foreground to rear without ever breaking stride. Witness also Foon's deft, sonorous playing on ""Sweet Grace For Devious"", as she glides in and around her cello's upper registers, sharing melodic duties with Krug's austere piano. For his part, Krug here appears to betray a preference for detuned upright pianos, as evidenced by his solo turn on ""Waiting"", which sounds as though it could've been performed on some old tack in an empty VFW hall.</p><p>
    For ""Out From Behind the Rigid Bellows"", Krug swaps piano for accordion, the three musicians conjuring the mesmeric groans of a ghost ship's riggings as it sails from one exotic port of call to the next, while on the closing ""Bless Our Wandering Dreamers"" they combine to join into impressively robust drones, distant strains of mandolin and cello hovering about the edges like the rapidly fading memory of a dream upon waking. Of all the tracks on the album, it's this final cut that most audibly contains evidence of improvisation, suggesting bold new possibilities for future Fifths of Seven projects, as hopefully the three musicians find time to become even further comfortable in each other's creative company.</p></div>"|3341.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3341-spry-from-bitter-anise-folds/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

    the book. Meanwhile, the post-flannel alt-pop of bands like Weezer,
    the Rentals, or Superchunk isn't cliché per se, but it weaves together
    guitar-pop's most-worn threads: chunky guitars, ooh-ah harmonies,
    geeky romance lyrics. No Wait Wait, headed by Marc Gartman, aids me in employing a rockwriterly cliché by embracing
    such touchstones while also subverting them.</p><p>
    To Gartman, either love's a joke, or he's just telling himself that.
    On catchy first single ""The Score"", Gartman sports a Ben Folds slacker
    drawl as he slips into deep denial about amour. ""There's nothing real
    about the pain of love,"" he sings on <em>Navy Blues</em>-era Sloan-like
    opener ""Faith and Words"". A jocularly Jurassic guitar solo only blurs
    the question. The supine ""A Worried Mind Ventures"" wades into wimpy
    college-rock with splashes of <em>Murmur</em>-era R.E.M. or even Toad
    the Wet Sprocket, but now Gartman is hiding his hurt behind hep
    references: ""You are my Nico."" Apparently his would-be Warhol pinup
    can't stand the sound of the Velvet Underground, because in the Joe
    Jackson piano-pop of ""The Luckiest Bastard"" she goes off to ""star"" on
    Hollywood Blvd., and ""this ain't a Hollywood ending"". Gartman's
    subject matter is basic, and he doesn't take it far afield, but
    sometimes he pushes the typical heartache just enough.</p><p>
    Much of the album conveys that lyrical content through 90s-style
    alt-pop like that mentioned above, buoyed by hooky synths and raw
    production. On ""Beaches of the World"", Gartman veers briefly into
    teenage territory: ""The jocks can't make you laugh/ And the geeks
    just do your math."" But often, No Wait Wait offset their upbeat bounce
    with spacious slowcore, in the classic Low mold, as on the dizzying
    highlight ""Love's Lost Cause"". No surprise, then that Low's Alan
    Sparhawk plays in the band, and released the album on his label. While
    the more deliberately paced songs sometimes drag, they provide a nice
    addition the record's palette.</p><p>
    So Gartman is a bitter, witty, self-deceiving ex-romantic who rocks
    like the recent oldies but steps on the decelerator like a veteran
    city driver. The songs on No Wait Wait's self-titled review are rarely
    unique enough to merit a long recall, but they often capture the heart
    with their lyricism and effervescent melodies. The pain of love is
    real, Mr. Gartman, but so is the moderate amusement of pretty-good
    power pop.</p></div>"|5916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5916-no-wait-wait/|6.9|Marc Hogan

Arrayed on the band's driveway among the piles of </i><i>National Geographic back issues, that box of old shoes (all left feet, all size 14), and that collection of beer cozies are all the cuts that didn't fit on their three studio albums: the B-sides, oddball covers (ELO! Britney Spears! Burt Bacharach!), fan-only holiday songs, live tracks, even some radio spots. In other words, </i><i>Out-of-State Plates isn't supposed to be a real album; instead, playing off the commercial success of ""Stacy's Mom"", it's supposed to be mindlessly fun, produce a summer radio single (""Maureen""), and keep the band as close as possible to the forefront of the collective pop-culture conscious.</i></p><p>
    
    If <i>Out-of-State Plates is about as revelatory as your typical garage sale, it's not because these are necessarily bad songs (except for their lamentable cover of ""...Baby One More Time"")-- it's just that most of them seem somehow defective, one element overpower-popping the others.  The bop-bop-ba's that anchor ""Janice's Party"" are more annoying than infectious, revealing how close to whiny Chris Collingwood can come without truly whining.  Others try much too hard, with hooks that wheedle their way into your cranium with a carsalesmanly overenthusiasm (""Elevator Up""), and just to switch things up, a few don't try hard enough (""Kid Gloves"").  Cumbersome concepts overburden the novelty of ""Karpet King"", ""California Sex Lawyer"", ""Half a Woman"", and the suite of holiday-themed songs, so that they get tangled in their own shoelaces and stumble nowhere in particular. ""Comedienne"" egregiously tries to cast an Elaine Boosler wannabe as a tragic heroine, but to no real avail, although the phrase ""is she killing or dying"" is a nice twist.</i></p><p>
    
    Fortunately, that humor and wordplay (which reflects the band's debt to country music punnage) does manage to provide a couple of rare bright spots over the course of the compilation's two discs.  ""Maureen"", about a friendgirl with overshare issues, makes a nice opener (and a <i>far</i> better single than ""Stacy's Mom""), although if I were cynical I might say the verse about how good the title character looks in a bikini was written expressly for video treatment.  Even better is ""The Girl I Can't Forget"", a song whose alcoholic regret (""It's the night I can't remember..."") is goofily tempered by the shock of having it all work out in the end (""...with the girl I can't forget"").</p><p>
    
    The best material here, however, falls to a pair of songs about clever guys dating dumb girls: On ""Baby I've Changed"" a guy begs for forgiveness and promises not to grumble anymore when she wants to hear Sugar Ray, and on ""I'll Do the Driving"", over a pulsing kickdrum rhythm, perhaps the very same guy contemplates his hazy future with a girl who ""has a soft spot for cops who are robots."" The songs would sound mean-spirited were it not for the narrators' off-guard surprise at falling for girls who love ""When It's Over"" and don't know the difference between the Stones and Johnny Cash.</p><p>
    
    While these two lovestruck-dumb doofuses prove there is an intelligent and mischievous personality behind these songs, by commenting on each other's song they also reveal what is perhaps the chief deficiency of <i>Out-of-State Plates: Each of Fountains of Wayne's three albums has its own particular personality, which raises the songs above the status of mere novelty, but </i><i>Out-of-State Plates, by definition, has none. Its rummaged organization precludes the sort of niceties that benefit their records-- structure, atmosphere, setting, characters, stories, and on and on. As a result, there's no cumulative effect here, which perhaps for some listeners is the attraction: the chance to hear these songs completely divorced of any larger context-- to hear each of them as sovereign singles-- promises another discovery like ""Radiation Vibe"" or ""Denise"".  However, this means every song stands alone, even though only a few hold up to that kind of serious-shopper scrutiny.</i></p></div>"|3163.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3163-out-of-state-plates/|5.9|Stephen M.

Chicago Acid and Experimental House 1985-1995|0.0|Various Artists|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Soul Jazz']|2005-06-28 00:00:00|2005|2016-06-11 20:57:22.433250|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1mf8j2706io.1.6:0.1.0.$1995/=1$1995.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Acid was a dance craze that became a culture. Read a lot of the
    literature
    at the time (at least in the U.S.) and you'd think you were reading early
    60s
    descriptions of the mashed potato and the popcorn. (Something the music
    reinforced with all those ""this is how u jack"" lyrics and titles.)
    Early
    Chicago house was seen by a lot of American commentators (rightly, more
    or
    less) as a cut-rate extension of disco with some added Prince.</p><p>
    
    Pretty quickly, however, as house clubs became as briefly prominent in
    New
    York as hip-hop ones, house could not be denied. As with everything-- rock'n'roll, disco, punk, rap-- initially viewed with a cocked eyebrow as a
    ""fad,""
    acid (and house) thrived beyond all expectations. When it hit England,
    it
    promptly upended their entirely pop industry for a decade.</p><p>
    
    Today, ""acid"" describes both a moment (the mid-to-late 1980s) and a
    genre
    (house music made with the Roland 303 synthesizer). So does this
    compilation, impeccably timed by Soul Jazz to follow the hipster snout
    to
    the next truffle after punk-funk and early 80s electro. (By my
    estimation
    we should arrive at Detroit techno before year's end.) People who
    should
    know better rag on Soul Jazz, but if you already own all these songs on
    their original vinyl pressings, this-- despite a generous amount of liner notes and historical material-- isn't for you. But I am
    guessing you don't. I sure don't.</p><p>
    
    The first acid track is the last one here. Phuture (DJ Pierre, Spanky,
    Herb,
    and Marshall Jefferson) created ""Acid Tracks"" in late 1985, holed up in
    their apartments against the harsh Chi-town winter, abusing a piece of
    technology that was a commercial flop. The Roland 303 bassline
    synthesizer
    sounded so wack when put to its intended use that no self-respecting
    guitarist would touch it. So it was cheap, and that's how Pierre,
    Spanky,
    and Herb got a hold of it. There's a MIDI bleep lurking in the guts of
    the
    thing, and when the trio cranked the volume and began twisting the
    knobs the
    acid house noise came out.</p><p>
    
    It's kind of hard to describe-- a robot bullfrog imitating a car alarm
    played on an octave hopping keyboard-- but by now everyone knows it.
    Jefferson told them to slow it down 10bpm to 120, and showed them how
    to get
    it pressed to vinyl. By that point the name had been changed from ""In
    Your
    Mind"" to ""Acid Tracks"", as it had colloquially become known as ""Ron
    Hardy's
    acid track."" Hardy lorded over the sweat-tippled sardine tin called the
    Music Box that, along with Frankie Knuckles' Warehouse, was one of house music's two sacred sites. He had played
    the
    track on reel-to-reel tape at the Box to ecstatic response, and his
    kingmaking abilities allowed acid to thrive. As creation myths go, it's
    a
    pretty good one.</p><p>
    
    One the one hand, ""Acid Tracks"" is the only acid track anyone really
    needs.
    They're all variations on that bassline, essentially. The machine does
    a lot
    of the randomization for you: Take the batteries out and there's a
    whole new
    bassline waiting for you the next time you turn it on. On the other
    hand,
    with the right fingers on the knobs, there's room for endless creative
    variation. <em>Acid</em> is a strange mix of B-sides and lesser-known tracks
    with
    a few classics thrown in, but it still manages to hit most of the major
    acid
    tropes.</p><p>
    
    Like the cheesy (in a good way) vocals on opener ""This Is Acid"" by
    Maurice,
    which performs the ""rock &amp; roll will never die"" role. (Only when a
    genre is
    newborn does it get to name more than 50% of its songs after itself.)
    ""This
    is the ultimate acid track."" It's not, really, but it is very charming.
    Or
    the spooky narrator of Sleazy D's ""I've Lost Control"", which
    anthropomorphizes that ""too far gone"" feeling of being nose bleedingly
    fucked up on cocaine. (Or, uh, so I've heard.) Or the synths running in
    the
    background of Mr. Fingers' ""Beyond the Clouds"" that sound like they
    could be
    straight off an Erasure record. Or the weird Oompa Loompa chanting on
    Fresh's ""Dum Dum Pt. 2"". Or the bracingly crude, jacking drum machines
    powering most of the songs here, drums that can sound like thunderclaps
    or a
    child's rock tumbler, often in the same song.</p><p>
    
    But here's the thing. Acid gets a little boring and samey in isolation
    and
    repetition. Plus, it's club music. Heard in your living room, I
    wouldn't
    blame you for pulling a shrug. Acid can be amazingly powerful,
    catalytic
    music, or it can be Eurodisco with funny whub whub noises overtop. So,
    if
    early house is still terra incognita, I'd actually suggest starting
    with
    last year's amazing (and more wide reaching) Trax Records mix. Or the
    more
    catholic <i>Warp 10+1: Influences comp that came out in 1999 (and includes
    ""Acid Tracks"".) But if you've already jacked the box once or twice,
    </i><i>Acid has
    all the robot bullfrogs and crass drum machines you could ask for.

    to 
    reference country and space-rock makes them seem as far apart as two 
    styles of popular music could get, but the 
    sounds 
    that characterize each genre are just waiting to be 
    combined, as exhibited by the sophomore album from Dameon Lee's 
    Lowlights. The band's debut album was a stately collection of 
    elegant, 
    nocturnal soundtracks for interstellar travel. <em>Dark End Road</em> has the 
    two-step rhythms of classic country-- edges hung with fiddle, harmonica, 
    and 
    pedal steel-- and it also glows with spectral organ and washes of astral 
    guitar and flute, all of it marinating in about a million cubic miles 
    of 
    reverb.</p><p>
    
    On ""Dark End Road"" and ""Emily"", relatively conventional country songs 
    stuffed with two-part harmonies and twanging guitar, the edges unravel 
    with 
    echoing steel guitar and organ, giving Lee's pleasant, low-key vocals a 
    dusky, galactic texture to slip into. The entire album seems to unfold 
    amidst a backdrop of dark, psychedelic matter, the kind of sound that 
    doesn't make itself openly known, but whose weight undeniably affects 
    the 
    feel of the entire record. A sweet, even insecure, ballad like ""Snow 
    Is 
    Silver"" has a certain low-level glow to it that elevates it beyond its 
    status as the slowest, sparsest track on the disc.</p><p>
    
    The lynchpins of the album are undoubtedly two early, majestic songs 
    that 
    distill the mix of the down-to-earth and the interstellar to its purest 
    state. Opener ""The One I Love Is Gone"" shambles in with a beguiling 
    blend 
    of viscerally recorded fiddle (you can hear the scraping of the bow) 
    and 
    black hole organ, Lee's voice and acoustic guitar settling 
    into 
    the cosmic goo as comfortably as they might on a porch step. ""The Way 
    You 
    Were"", on the other hand, is a majestic stroll across the planes 
    on a star-filled night. Vibes, synths and 
    heavily reverbed flutes slide through the mix, anchored by Lee's guitar 
    and 
    voice, and electric guitars twang along on the margins.</p><p>
    
    This is the second well-realized album from Lowlights, and though I 
    enjoyed the 
    hazy sprawl of their debut a bit more than <em>Dark End Road</em>, this is a 
    strong 
    sophomore showing that significantly broadens the band's palette.</p></div>"|4947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4947-dark-end-road/|7.7|Joe Tangari

(The pathetic 2002 cash-in attempt <em>The Trials and Tribulations of Russell Jones</em></i> was a callous hodge-podge of an album that had little to do with Dirty.) Seemingly for the sake of symmetry alone, there are now two best-of retrospective collections dedicated to the man's tragically brief solo career as well: 2001's label-contract fulfilling <i>The Dirty Story and this highly repetitive, largely unnecessary 16-track CD/DVD combo. The existence of such a superfluous disc is even more idiotic considering <em>Return to the 36 Chambers</em> and <em>N***a Please</em> are both so chock full of classic material that listening to them straight through is an undeniable pleasure that needn't be tampered with.</i></p><p>
    
    Given the shamelessly exploitative nature of this release (""Let 'em know you're Dirty!"" spouts a craven insert promoting ODB ringtones), there are a couple of short-but-sweet bonuses for hardcore fans on the accompanying DVD. The extra disc features his excellent, insane music videos for ""Brooklyn Zoo"", ""Shimmy Shimmy Ya"", and ""Got Your Money"". A hip-hop answer to Weezer's ""Happy Days""-sampling ""Buddy Holly"" video, ""Got Your Money"" tries the same trick with <i>Dolemite to hilarious effect, inserting obviously mis-matched ODB footage from the ""Shimmy"" clip to make up for then-troubled artist's absence. And Dirt's Funkadelic, brain-fried performance in the pre-<em>Austin Powers</em> afro flashback clip for ""Shimmy"" may be the best visual depiction of his genius ever recorded.</i></p><p>
    
    But, fact is, those videos aren't new and you've probably seen them many times before. The only footage included that fans may not be familiar with is a 1995 TV ""interview"" that sees ODB, the RZA, and a small army of hangers-on walking, talking, drinking 40s, and spontaneously freestyling through the streets of New York (""Niggas comin' through the trees like a salamander/ Bitin' like a piranha/ But I'm bitin' you back like a Black Panther!"" goes one spectacular Dirty outburst). It's as brilliant as it sounds. At one particularly inspired point, Dirt puts forth an ambitious Wu mission: ""Destroying all that negativity that's in the world, we emblemishing [sic] all that!"" Also, during a rare moment of relative calm, he sadly predicts future problems, ""I already witnessed death, kid-- and the death was to be dead mentally."" Whether he's inadvertently spitting at the camera lens or advertently fogging it up, the too-short exhibition of all things Dirty will undoubtedly, and sadly, having you wishing for more of his singular charms.</p><p>
    
    No matter how good the uncovered footage is, though, it's probably not worth the almost $20 list price. For the real story, the uninitiated would be best served by doling out a few more bucks and picking up Dirt's two accomplished solo LPs.</p></div>"|6105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6105-the-definitive-ol-dirty-bastard-story/|4.8|Ryan Dombal

At only 264 words, Lincoln delivered the inspiring oration in approximately six minutes, with phrases like ""of the people, by the people, and for the people"" leaving an indelible imprint on America. At 1:37, Battletorn's <em>Villains/Reversed</em> is a curt ""fuck you"" from the New York metal underground band-- and very vehemently <em>not</em> for the people.</p><p>
    This nihilistic Brooklyn trio must enjoy irking people with the brevity thing (their shows notoriously last between five and 11 minutes), but how does one ignore the fact that the record's length carries a stronger statement than the music itself? I know, I know, Mike Patton's been pulling these hijinks with Fantômas too, but he's got cred and, well, everyone's just accepted that he's bat-shit insane at this point. And yes, this may be purported as a mere seven-inch, but it feels like a teaser for their full-length to be released later in the year. And not a very enticing one at that.</p><p>
    Even if limited by the stingiest of word counts, I could allot each second of music a full word here. However, Battletorn's sound hardly warrants such fine-tooth combing. This is bare-bones metalcore copped from the mid-80s NYC underground, sporting über-obscure influences like Sin 34 and the Comes. Unfortunately, while the songs' BPM and volume are jacked, the ideas are pretty ho-hum. But hey, that's the danger of a guitar/drums dynamic-- most songs can't be propped up by palm-muting, jarring chromatics, and ubiquitous cymbal crashes alone. Don't get me wrong, the power chord progressions here aren't terrible, but a riff or two along with some more unpredictable percussion fills wouldn't hurt.</p><p>
    Most intriguing on these two brief noise spasms is lead singer Beverly's grating howl. The distortion surrounding her vocals is more calculated than the average metal singer's fuzz and feedback, and her shrieks emit the Transylvanian creepiness of a female Hisham Baroocha. The catch? We're only offered a glimpse of the only truly captivating aspect of this band. If this little snippet's potential is in any way valid, then hopefully their next release will at least be long enough for people to listen to on the car ride to work. If not, they could always try commercial jingles.</p></div>"|1165.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1165-villainsreversed/|4.0|Adam Moerder

    life partner of Dave Eggers' literary journal
    </em><em>McSweeney's</em>, a monthly collection of essays, reviews,
    interviews, and somewhat random columns. Populated by
    the likes of Nick Hornby, Rick Moody, artist Charles
    Burns, and the occasional Sedaris, it rather quickly
    and effortlessly assumed the position of periodical
    meeting place for the young, hip, and literary. Given
    that we aspire to be all of the above, you might
    imagine that a lot of Pitchfork staffers are on the
    subscription rolls of <em>The Believer</em>, and if it didn't
    cost so much, you'd be right.</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, the mutual publication love party only
    goes so far. <em>The Believer</em> planted its flag on the
    lit-crit scene with an essay by editor-in-chief Heidi
    Julavits declaring an end to ""snark,"" the practice of
    being a big mean bully hiding behind a byline and an
    artsy NYTBR illustration. Pitchfork, of course, is
    The House that Snark Built, and you'll have to pry the
    snark out of our Cold. Dead. Haaaaaands. Due to our
    different territories, these irreconcilable
    differences aren't a problem 11 months out of the
    year, but every June an invading party is sent with
    <i>The Believer</i> Music Issue and its accompanying compact
    disc supplement.</p><p>
    
    Now if there were ever an example of the narcissism of
    small differences, it's this; the CD included with the
    2004 music issue was like a mix disc predicting our
    2004 Top Albums list, featuring as it did folks like
    the Books, Ted Leo, the Walkmen, and TV on the Radio. 
    This year's installment is likewise packed with
    Fork-friendly artists, although this time with a twist-- rather than simply throwing together the old
    previously-released material, <em>The Believer</em> challenges
    the participants to share the gift of royalties and
    cover a peer's composition.</p><p>
    
    'Tis a noble concept, allowing artists to pay rare
    tribute to contemporaries while keeping them from
    dusting off that cover of ""Blue Jay Way"" they recorded
    the night the bass player was too drunk to pluck. On
    the other hand, the stable of musicians selected for
    inclusion-- and the material they, in turn, decide to
    remake-- encapsulates the dullness of this strain of
    indie, a drab made exponentially stronger by the
    enforced cross-pollination. For <em>The Believer</em> has a
    fetish for indie rock that's literate (no duh) and
    guitar-based, and so we get a collection every bit as
    singer-songwriter-heavy as Starbuck's music except
    with a lower profile-- call it
    independent-coffee-store-down-the-street-from-Starbuck's
    music.</p><p>
    
    Who else could open a literary journal's music issue
    compilation than the Decemberists? Covering Joanna
    Newsom's ""Bridges and Balloons"", Colin Meloy sets the
    tone for the hour to come by performing it as a one-man acoustical jam, replacing Newsom's Lisa Simpson
    with his own Professor Frink. It's good; I prefer
    Newsom's compositions with a little more foundation. 
    Also good on the sim-busking front is The Mountain
    Goats' cover of the Silver Jews' ""Pet Politics"", about
    as perfect a musical match as you can find. Other
    unplugged moments do little to rebut my coffee-shop
    impressions, such as the Cat Power clone two-fer in
    the middle (Josephine Foster and Cynthia G. Mason) or
    somebody named Two Gallants picking up the Neil
    Diamond worship where Crooked Fingers left off.</p><p>
    
    There's little to write 10-page essays about in terms
    of full-band performances either, with Spoon
    absolutely sleepwalking through Yo La Tengo's ""Decora""
    (not that somnambulant isn't perhaps the appropriate
    means of addressing YLT) and the reappearance of the
    Shins' listless version of the Postal Service's ""We Will Become Silhouettes"". Only a
    couple tracks stand out as more than novelty and
    rarities-comp filler: Jim Guthrie's take on the
    Constantines' ""Nighttime/Anytime (It's Alright)"",
    which remakes the testosterone-rock of the original as a
    slow-burn violin funk, and CocoRosie's no-fi
    reinvention of Damien Jurado's ""Ohio"". Then there's
    Devendra Banhart taking on Antony &amp; The Johnson's
    ""Fistful of Love"", which depending on your taste for
    unique vocal stylings, is either the sound of hell
    incarnate or a warbly dream come true.</p><p>
    
    So apologies to Snarkwatch, but this collection does
    little to increase its value beyond free handout. 
    While the concept is noble, the editors would be
    advised to go with a less one-dimensional roster for
    next year's issue, to stretch out beyond the tight
    boundaries of acoustic-folk, freak-folk, and

Put to practice, however, this homespun assortment of minute individual sound particles is assembled into an astonishingly seamless mosaic over which Hukkelberg crafts her breezily jazzy electronic pop-- the resulting effect of which is something like watching an artisan build a functional wristwatch out of spun glass and raw sugar cane.</p><p>
<em>Little Things</em> was painstakingly arranged and recorded over the course of two years by the 26-year-old Hukkelberg and producer Kåre Vestrheim, who also helmed Shining's <em>In the Kingdom of Kitsch You Will Be a Monster. But despite its meticulous construction, upon casual listen the album can appear to be almost formlessly wispy. Hukkelberg's sparkling, effortlessly likable vocals evoke those of a carefree Lisa Germano, or perhaps a frostier, more tranquil Solex; and draw immediate (if somewhat predictable) comparison to her fellow Norwegians Susanna and the Magical Orchestra. With each song tightly-fitted with miniature, agile machinery, </em><em>Little Things</em> is an album that best rewards close, undistracted attention, its every delicate tendril capable of sprouting a blossom.</p><p>
    Quietly lapping water and gentle strains of Hawaiian pedal steel accompany ""Cast Anchor"", while Hukkelberg celebrates ""not the urge to go somewhere else/ not the urge to blow away/ but the urge for stand still."" On ""Little Girl"" she incorporates playful carnival textures, with jaunty banjo and tuba dovetailing-- perhaps even a bit too pristinely-- into dreamy meadows of ambient electronics.</p><p>
    Featuring contributions from various members of Norwegian acts like Shining, Jaga Jazzist, and Kaada, the jazz-inflected playing on <em>Little Things</em> is stellar throughout; although you may wish Hukkelberg and Vestrheim had occasionally allowed things to become more unbuttoned. The woozy Dixieland touches on ""Displaced"" are about as raucous as the album ever gets, though tracks like ""True Love"" and ""Koeft"" do contain some pleasantly chewy bits of languid woodwinds, jazzy guitar and diced Monkish piano.</p><p>
    As a songwriter Hukkelberg proves unafraid to do a little strenuous legwork, typically bypassing the easy chorus or turn of phrase in favor of thornier, gradually unwinding melodicism. In so doing, it might seem that she leaves some tantalizingly ripe hooks on the vine on such tracks as the Joni Mitchell-like ""Do Not as I Do"" or the blissful, strolling-accordion closer ""Boble"". Instead she has chosen to gather a harvest more distinctively and peculiarly her own, a decision that sounds more sensible with each subsequent listen.</p></div>"|4013.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4013-little-things/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

    five years or so making a name for themselves as one of the premiere
    grindcore crossover bands in the country. Their sophomore release,
    <em>Clients</em>, is a frenzied blast of uncompromising aggression that
    fuses the chaos, growling vocals and lightening-fast beats of death
    metal and grindcore with the technical prowess of experimental math-
    metal and the occasional driving, mid-tempo hardcore rhythm. Frankly,
    the band seems to be striving to combine just about every genre of
    heavy music, and for the most part the mix is an overwhelming success.</p><p>
    
    The band is strongest when they're at their most frenetic and
    unpredictable. The complicated rhythms keep things fresh, as well as
    setting the Red Chord apart from the thousands of generic grindcore
    bands out there who rely on speed alone to provide the necessary
    aggressive backbone. The album's opener, ""Fixation on Plastics"", is
    2:44 seconds of blast beats, squealing guitar harmonics, and singer
    Guy Kozowyk's guttural, inhuman roar. Fueled by drummer Brad
    Frickeisen, the song shifts gears so rapidly it's almost hard to keep
    up. Similarly, ""Black Santa"" is unrelenting, offering solid proof
    that the band's ability to maintain focus at lightening-fast speeds
    is one of their biggest assets. ""Upper Decker"" throws in a completely
    unexpected, minute-long bridge about halfway through that combines
    rumbling drums with atmospheric guitar strumming. It's almost, dare I
    say, pretty, yet as the song kicks back into high gear, everything
    gets progressively more intense. The result is one of the
    album's most powerful moments.</p><p>
    
    When the band strays into more straightforward hardcore territory,
    the results aren't as positive. ""Lay the Tarp"", for example, begins
    with a bob-your-head groove that recurs throughout the song, no doubt
    inspiring testosterone-fueled circle pits whenever it's played live.
    Even though the song features plenty of the band's breakneck
    ferocity, it never quite overcomes its own hardcore leanings.
    ""Antman"" suffers a similar fate, but its high-pitched guitar
    harmonies and rhythmic guessing-game do keep it from coming across
    quite as tired. Kozowyk's voice is strong when he stays low and
    raspy, but when he switches to the spoken/shouted style, it loses so
    much of its power, going from merciless to meathead in the blink of
    an eye. Luckily, it's a style he uses very sparingly.</p><p>
    
    The album's most pleasant surprise is the instrumental closing track,
    ""He Was Dead When I Got There"". By grindcore standards, it's epic,
    clocking in at almost seven-and-a-half minutes. ""He Was Dead When I
    Got There"" extends from a long line of melodic thrash instrumentals,
    occupying the same realm as Metallica's ""Orion"" and Anthrax's ""Intro
    to Reality"". Nothing else on <em>Clients</em> comes close to this level
    of delicate musicianship. It's a fine end to a bludgeoning disc, and
    it proves that The Red Chord is a band that uses their talents to
    play intricate music at amazing speeds-- not one that uses amazing
    speeds to cover up a lack of talent.</p></div>"|6946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6946-clients/|7.1|Cory D. Byrom

Grizzled rockwriters and
    idealistic techno-savants have been waving that apocalyptic placard
    for years now (sheesh, millennia!). Here's More Dogs, latest tombnail
    in tow. Seven tracks, 28 minutes: An EP, right? Warm bowl of miso
    soup, sashimi tray still TK? But these ramshackle Baltimore-based
    atmosphere-vendors are calling <em>Never Let Them Catch You Crying</em>
    a full-length, and for once, I'm not gonna argue.</p><p>
    
    What More Dogs' second ahem ell-pee (first for Monitor) lacks in
    length, it makes up for with big-top instrumentation, <em>Nosferatu</em>
    organs, rhythmic fakeouts, and mood enough to send noted psychiatry
    expert Tom Cruise to his meds. <em>Never Let Them</em> is primarily
    instrumental, aside from the Zombies-like harmony that essentially
    bookends the album: ""When I think of you I think of sunshine,
    sunshine."" After those words, the title track fades into the sound of
    a crackling bonfire or approaching stampede. Both lyrics and, indeed,
    conventional melodies soon recede behind gloomy/anarchic scene-setting
    and a tumultuous story arc left largely to the imagination.</p><p>
    
    So, imagine: Second track ""Duty. Duty? Duty."" is a stranger walking in
    an unknown metropolis, past the waterfront, along rat-infested streets
    bespattered with pissy puddles. Vibraphones, acoustic guitar, bass and
    dramatic organ portray a man alone amid urban hurly-burly. On ""Teenage
    Bunker"", percussion conquers all, clanging and clopping like a
    gruesome ""Sleigh Ride"" atop a suspenseful, spread-out bass line that
    soon grows violent. Rockists' friend Mr. Electric Guitar finally grabs
    a starring role on ""White People"", which during its quiet midsection
    evokes Radiohead's ""Exit Music (for a Film)"".</p><p>
    
    Watch out, ""Overeater Under Water"" follows with the post-punk card
    (disco hi-hat!), but the hee-haw bass line and modal guitar sketching
    still sound equally akin to a Russian folk dance. Disorientation gives
    way to vivid standout ""March to the Scaffold"", where further
    horrorshow organ stabs, lunatic percussion and vibraphones conjure up
    a public spectacle. An execution? Bass murmurs like a milling throng.
    Then ""This Is the One"" closes the disc in the red, mortally convulsing
    with feedback and cascading guitar nose. The album is dead; long
    live... shit. More Dogs would never be so obvious.</p></div>"|5655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5655-never-let-them-catch-you-crying/|7.1|Marc Hogan

    short experiments in both guitar feedback and computerized loops with
    frenzied, unpredictable rhythms in the tradition of Brainiac and Les Savy
    Fav. The band threw everything against the wall on <em>Terrorbird</em>, and
    a few transcendent moments inevitably stuck. With only 10 songs and a runtime of 15 minutes and change, <em>Heartbeeps</em> seems paltry in comparison. Still, the band covers plenty of ground without the the grab-bag diversity or noisy extremes of their earlier work.</p><p>
    
    For a record that lasts only 15 minutes, the pacing is clever. Putting all the two- to three-minute tracks at the end makes them feel epic in comparison to the first half; as soon as you're used to the longer song lengths, the
    album's over. Songs here are segmented and repeated in the same manner as on Terrorbird. ""Heartbeeps"" appears three times as the album's centerpiece and its bookends. It starts with a few erratic pumps of noise before it finds a pulse on the last track, given two minutes of skittering hi-hats and steady bass to find the melody. Same with ""Spoils
    of Injury"", 40 seconds of simple electronic beats and simple melody
    that introduces (but doesn't precede) the droning ""Spoils of Victory"".
    Compared to the mess of their debut, the puzzle pieces are a little
    easier to pick up on when there's less of them.</p><p>
    
    The album's second half shifts its gears within each song. ""Crimes of
    Infancy"" begins with staccato bursts of rhythm before breaking into
    fluid single-note guitar lines and finishing with windmill-strummed
    chords. ""Eat the Prize"" contrasts a Jesus Lizard hoedown with weary
    synthesizers, and ends with a circuitous melody on unaccompanied guitar.
    ""The Universal Polymath"" covers the most ground most convincingly, from
    stomping drums to a jagged, bassless melody and ending with a simmering
    near-freakout. The restraint in these songs goes a long way to proving
    the band's talents can match their mash-up instincts.</p><p>
    
    It may lack the highs of <em>Terrorbird</em> like ""Power to the Power
    Bite Two"", but <em>Heartbeeps</em> achieves the same ends faster and more
    concisely. There's still much untapped potential within this young band,
    but their gap between proficiency and being merely clever is narrowing.</p></div>"|5600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5600-heartbeeps-ep/|7.0|Jason Crock

But he's better known as the king of Baltimore club music, a cheap, hard, frantic, fiercely regional strain of black house music that exists only within Baltimore. Baltimore club's closest sonic cousin is probably baile funk-- both rely heavily on unlicensed samples and relentless, virtually amelodic beats. But baile funk is a distant descendent of the frisky, infectious party chants of Miami bass, whereas club comes from the insistent, twitchy minimalism of Detroit and Chicago house. As a result, Baltimore club has a bleak, paranoid edge that baile funk lacks, and the intensely sexual lyrics are in English, not Portuguese, so you can't pretend they aren't nasty.</p><p>
    
    Club music has ruled dancefloors and radio in Baltimore for 15 years, but it remains virtually unheard outside the city-- partly because club producers proudly ignore copyright laws and partly because the music is too damn weird and hard to be considered pop. But blogs like Government Names and tastemaking out-of-town DJs like Diplo and DJ/rupture have given the music a strong internet buzz, and now Lee's label Club Kingz has a distribution deal with Morphius Records, which may well bring Lee's mix CD <em>Vol. 5: The Official</em> to an indie record store near you.</p><p>
<i>The Official is a turgid, overlong, and repetitive mix, with precious few hooks to make the ferocious, concussive breakbeats go down more easily. And yet it also makes a pretty good case that Baltimore club is one of the rawest, most exciting forms of dance music on the planet. A track like DJ Technics' ""The PJ Chant"" starts with a skeletal stomp-clap drum machine and an anthemic horn riff chopped up to sound like a siren, brings in sampled female moans and skittery beatboxing before dropping everything out for a climactic two-note foghorn tuba riff, then builds everything back up into dense, pulsing swirl-- all within two minutes. Lee's own ""Watch My Ass"" lays a shuffling, rattling drum break under Lady Margetta's cold, unemotional X-rated vocal (""Watch my ass as I'm grindin' on ya dick, daddy""), then multitracks and layers Margetta's vocal until it becomes a part of the beat itself. KW-Griff's ""The Problem"" speeds up the eerie horror-movie pianos from Lil Scrappy's ""No Problem"" to cartoonish velocities, adding goofy whizzing sound effects and an uproarious sampled burp to the mix.</i></p><p>
    
    It all adds up into a bruising, mind-warping monolith. But every once in a while, something painfully human jumps out of the stew. Lee's ""Luvin' You"" supports a crushingly sad vocal from the R&amp;B; group Status with an uncharacteristically twerky, infectious Green Velvet-ish old-school house track. Nigga Say What's ""Horn Theme"" combines an obliteratingly huge horn riff with an epic, apocalyptic choir to stunning effect. And on ""Dance My Pain Away"", Lee's unpolished, atonal vocals tell a tale of financial stress (""Listen to my story/ Bill collectors on me/ Have to file bankruptcy"") before building to triumphant chorus: ""I'm gonna dance my pain away."" It's not only a great track; it's an explanation of how a furious, urgent, unforgiving mutation of house music captured a poor, dangerous city.</p></div>"|4985.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4985-vol-5-the-official/|7.9|Tom Breihan

    his <em>Amélie</em> score, but in France, he's a mainstream sensation
    who's dabbled in rock, punk, pop, and various works for stage and
    screen; a popular aesthete whose stark compositions are comparable to
    those of Erik Satie and Phillip Glass. In the United States, Shannon
    Wright is best known as the other P.J. Harvey, with a brace of
    Steve Albini-produced records to show for it, but in France, she's best
    known for collaborating with Yann Tiersen. If <em>Amélie</em> had been
    an angsty melodrama about the impossibility of connection rather than
    a bubbly farce that hinged on implausible connectivity, this
    collaboration would have served it well.</p><p>
    It doesn't seem as if either musician had to bend their aesthetic very
    far to make it fit. Wright doesn't log as much ragged guitar
    slashing as she normally does, but her emotionally overstated,
    depressive whisper/caterwaul is well-matched by the cinematic
    stateliness and tragic beauty of Tiersen's piano, violin, and
    accordion arrangements. Insofar as the two halves are extricable,
    Tiersen's contribution is more compelling. Wright's histrionic singing
    style and often-mawkish lyrics are an acquired taste, and they impose
    overly concrete topical borders on Tiersen's evocative, tacitly
    emotional instrumental tracks. As a result, a music that could have
    told a thousand stories ends up telling exactly one-- that of Wright's
    bitter romantic distress. If I'd never heard either artist, I'd be
    more likely to search out Tiersen's solo work than Wright's.</p><p>
    Wright's singing here is particularly reminiscent of P.J. Harvey's
    <em>Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea</em>, and if you're a
    fan of either artist, this record's cachet jumps up several notches.
    It opens with the rumbling, metronomic piano chords and gradually
    intensifying string accents of ""No Mercy for She"", a dark clockwork
    dirge trembling on the brink of atonality. ""Dragonfly"" features the
    wistful accordion that characterized <em>Amélie</em> and scattered
    echoic guitars. ""Dried Sea"" and ""While You Sleep"" are more
    rock-oriented, with the haunting arpeggios and studious dissonance of
    Wright's familiar guitar style weaving through Tiersen's sawing,
    tempestuous strings. There are some lovely classical piano phrases
    worked into ""Ode to a Friend"" and ""Callous Sun"", a nice contrast to
    the more cabaret-style pianos elsewhere. If Tiersen is providing the
    ballast for Wright's emotional catharsis, then this is the rare case
    where the ballast is more valuable than the cargo it accompanies. </p></div>"|8297.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8297-yann-tiersen-shannon-wright/|6.8|Brian Howe

    almost 
    unnerving consistency. Not only are these records roughly 
    comparable 
    in terms of quality, but across any individual album few tracks stand 
    out as failures, just as few are so great they dwarf the music 
    surrounding them. The Mice Parade sound-- a mixture of ringing acoustic 
    guitars layered in Reichian fashion, kinetic drumming, vibes, and 
    assorted non-Western instruments for flavoring-- has in a sense been 
    immune to composition. No matter how Pierce stretches and shapes the 
    pieces, it always sounds like Mice Parade and it always sounds good. 
    Recommending this band to somebody has always been cake: Just pick one 
    of the first five records at random and, if you like it, keep exploring 
    from there.</p><p>
    I wouldn't tell them to pick up the sixth album, however. In a sense 
    <em>Bem-Vinda Vontade</em> is easily comparable to its predecessors, with the 
    same 
    instruments beautifully recorded and repetitive songs that 
    swell and contract horizontally rather than using chords to develop. 
    But 
    <em>Bem-Vinda Vontade</em> expands on the use of voice introduced in 2004 on 
    <em>Obrigado Saudade</em> to the point where singing now a centerpiece of the 
    sound. And the vocals, mostly by Pierce and Kristín Anna Valt\xFDsdótti 
    (of 
    Múm), are sure to be divisive.</p><p>
    I know Múm's more song-oriented direction has its fans, but for my part 
    Valt\xFDsdótti's singing is completely unlistenable, a tuneless 
    whisper/shriek that seems to exist only as a twee placeholder without 
    having any content on its own. When she comes in on ""Night's Wave"" and 
    ""The Boat Room"" she completely pulls me out of whatever reverie the 
    music inspires. Here is an example of when indie's DIY inclusiveness goes too far.</p><p>
    Pierce's singing is spotty but sometimes works. He's only got a few 
    notes to choose from, so the main problem is that pickings are so slim 
    in terms of melody. He duets with Valt\xFDsdótti on ""Night's Wave"" and the 
    music is actually quite good, a thick acoustic stew with furiously 
    strummed guitars, accordion, and Doug Scharin's ever-propulsive 
    drumming, but the actual tune is no match for what surrounds it. But 
    then ""Night's Wave"" ends as Dylan Christie's gorgeous cloud of vibes 
    span the threshold to ""Passing and Galloping"" (as ever, the editing is 
    excellent as one song into the next) and all of a sudden Pierce's 
    vocals 
    fit. The music on ""Passing and Galloping"" is just a shoegazy overdriven 
    guitar atop a bed of endless tom rolls and Pierce's simple vocal lament 
    is an effectively gentle contrast.</p><p>
    Nothing wrong with formerly instrumental bands wanting to experiment 
    with songs but it makes sense to recruit singers and songwriters that 
    approach the skill of the music that surrounds them. So much of 
    <em>Bem-Vinda Vontade</em> sounds so nice, with guitar and drum textures as 
    lovely as anything the band has attempted. But the singing seems tacked 
    on and the music suffers, resulting in Mice Parade's least consistent 
    album.</p></div>"|5261.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5261-bem-vinda-vontade/|6.4|Mark Richardson

Two years ago, the UK press and sanctimonious U.S. journalists were quick to scoff at America's unwillingness to embrace Electric Six's ""highly ironic"" brand of dick-and-fart-joke rock. The ""indie rock hates fun"" claims made sense for the dismissals of outlandish (but ingenious) acts the Darkness and Junior Senior, but where's the subtle witticism in ""I wanna take you to a gay bar""?</p><p>
    Yeah, ""Danger! High Voltage"" was killer, but hardly because of lines like ""Fire in the Taco Bell!"" A <em>lot</em> of things happened to go right for Electric Six on the track, most notably the cautious application of Dick Valentine's grating, class clown vocals. His affected growl may recall Jack Black or Adam Sandler, but what spews from Valentine's mouth is often painfully unfunny-- and downright unlistenable over an entire album. Which is a shame, because Electric Six's revamped guitar/bass/drums lineup oftentimes aims for the same straightforward rock aesthetic as the Hold Steady or Art Brut, albeit with brain-dead rather than merely divisive vocals.</p><p>
    As if per some Faustian agreement, <i>Fire struck gold with ""Danger!"" and came up dry on everything else, save for a few commendable stabs at synth pop and dance. Likewise, <em>Señor Smoke</em></i> flirts with mediocrity on some dancier tracks. ""Dance Epidemic"" dazzles in comparison to its peers, with its libido-driven funk guitar and voluptuous synth bass (think Enon's ""Leave It to Rust"" at a kegger) accounting for roughly 80% of the album's hooks in less than three minutes. The title of ""Dance-A-Thon 2005"" may somewhat falsely advertise, but I'll take its spacey post-grunge bassline and uncharacteristically reserved drumming over the AOR claptrap of their ""Radio Ga Ga"" cover.</p><p>
    But enough pussyfootin'-- it's time to address the real shit. This album drops four consecutive hard rock stinkbombs to kick things off, proving Andrew WK <em>has left a mark on the music world. Tongue-in-cheek, head-up-ass ballad ""Jimmy Carter"" gets its jollies referencing presidents (""Like Ronald Reagan falling asleep for ever more,"" yikes!) and quoting the Backstreet Boys. </em><em>Señor Smoke's saddest aspect, however, is its yearning for another dance-floor single. ""Devil Nights"" and ""Boy or Girl"" got high-hats, synths, and even steal the chords to ""Danger!"", but seem more concerned with cartoon sound effects and lines like ""Hi, welcome to Big Burger, may I take your order?"" You wanna be in a joke band, Dick? Fine, then you're gonna be treated like you're in one.</em></p></div>"|2735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2735-senor-smoke/|4.4|Adam Moerder

The characters nail every tic and whiny habit that we hate in ourselves, from feeling bad about feeling bad, to guilt over privilege, to minor acts of cowardice or selfishness, to the on-again, off-again relationships that wheeze but never die. Remember the scene in Season 3 when Nate Fischer, who can't bring himself to go home to his new wife, pulls over by the side of the road and beats off? Somebody should have won an Emmy for that.</p><p>
    
    And yet every episode offers a few moments that break through the wallowing to show something special and even inspiring, the kind of human moment that you see coming but that you like regardless. And I feel something similar about the setlist of this compilation, the second ""Six Feet Under"" soundtrack: On paper, it spends too much time on commercial, familiar adult pop and too little on edgy rock; in practice, the predictable songs hold up the best.</p><p>
    
    Take Coldplay. I'm as sick of them as the next guy, and actually, I blame television dramas for their overexposure: It seems like every show on the air pulls out ""Trouble"" or ""Clocks"" when the characters have to look extra-introspective, and whenever I hear Chris Martin's voice I think, ""acting crutch."" But on <em>Everything Ends</em>, ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" builds to an easy, reflective climax that leaves room to breathe-- and along with tunes like Phoenix's ""Everything Is Everything"" and ""Amazing Life"" by Jem (who sounds like a flirtier Dido), it rounds off a good dinner party mix.</p><p>
    
    ""Amazing Life"" is the one of four exclusive cuts on the soundtrack, and it's the only one that earned its paycheck. Interpol contributes ""Direction"", a mostly instrumental cut that sounds like between-scene incidental music, and the Caesars cover of ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"" stands solidly in the shadow of the original. Meanwhile, the exclusive that has scored the most attention so far is the Arcade Fire's ""Cold Wind"". Arcade Fire are big and they write about dead people, so you can see the brand synergy; but aside from an arch melody, the song seems like a throwaway-- and its ambience is too snowed-in and Win Butler's voice, too Grizzly Adams-like for Six Feet Under's SoCal setting.</p><p>
<i>Everything Ends flows as casually as if the entire Fischer family grabbed a handful of albums for the car, and sometimes the collisions are bizarre-- young Claire's overwraught choice of Radiohead's ""Lucky"", bumps into Irma Thomas' ""Time Is On My Side"", no doubt a childhood fave for matriarch Ruth Fischer. (The only flat-out dud: eight minutes of Death Cab for Cutie's ""Transatlanticism""? Dammit Nate!) Random but cozy, it's a fitting souvenir for the show, especially at the end: If you watch the show enough to remember the song ""Lonely Little Petunia"", you'll love Imogen Heap's brief and eerily spacious rendition, which closes the album on a note that's both bittersweet and creepysweet-- the kind of moment we'll miss after ""Six Feet Under"" is gone.</i></p></div>"|7896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7896-everything-ends-six-feet-under-ost-vol-2/|6.8|Chris Dahlen

For British alternapop groups in the early 90s, Jesus saved, while those bearing giddy power-pop later in the decade were invariably dubbed ""super.""  Lately, there's been an influx of repetition (Xiu Xiu, Man Man, Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and ""black"" bands (Black Dice, Black Keys, Black Eyes, Black Mountain), but increasingly, groups find themselves indebted to creatures of nature (Gorillaz, Deerhoof, Doves, Caribou, Pelican), and particularly wolves.  So in a period during which the animal kingdom permeates the independent aesthetic, it's hard not to admire the band that takes a big-picture approach: Welcome to the Wilderness.</p><p>  Formed three years ago in Baltimore, a city increasingly known for its thriving club music community, the art-rock four-piece builds off the history of pre-adolescent post-rock-- not the academic jazz-inflected instrumentals or orchestral crescendos associated with the genre today, but rather post-rock as defined in the early 90s by music journalist Simon Reynolds, a scene in which bands like Talk Talk, Bark Psychosis, and Disco Inferno applied guitars more for their aqueous, saturated textures and tones than for rigid pop structures.</p><p>  Like those bands, Wilderness deploy spacial, dream-like atmospheres and ominous ethereality over cymbals that shimmer and splash against tom-heavy drum patterns.  Brooding, artstruck guitars ring out from the depths, echoing the swirling neo-psych of Echo and the Bunnymen and the Teardrop Explodes. But when frontman James Johnson breaks like headlights through the mist, the picture shifts from bliss-out watercolor to black-streaked oil canvas: Channeling the primal weirdness of a young David Byrne, or the unhinged proclamations of Public Image Ltd's John Lydon, his words are more announced than sung, and like a number of Eno-era Talking Heads tracks, he often relies on distinctive sing/speak cadences in lieu of tightly structured vocal melodies.</p><p>  Rising, falling, and lifting again, Johnson's silvery howl rides the band's iridescent, rainswept instrumentation like a cresting tide, obscuring lyrics that alternate between abstract expressionism and fatalistic, anti-political rhetoric.  It's a fantastic technique, but also a risky one: On cursory listens, many listeners could find the album beautifully lush-- even pioneering-- yet still be somewhat put off by the seeming atonality of Johnson's unusual style.  But that's where the pleasant surprise lies: As these songs begin to settle in deeper, his vocal topography unexpectedly yields tons of melody where there initially may have seemed to be very little.</p><p>  Kicking in with an authoritative snare, a pause, and an explosive combination of smashed cymbal, walking bass, and stratospheric guitarwork, ""Marginal Over"" brightly broadcasts Wilderness' arrival, but it doesn't take long for things to turn darker: The doom-stricken ""Arkless"" lies at the heels of the opener, and just around the corner from that is one of the album's greatest-- and gravest-- standouts, the urgent, desolate ""End of Freedom"", which finds Johnson at his most animated and desperate, insistently commanding ""the hand over the fist.""  Later, in ""Fly Further to See"", the band ascends from the murk, emerging with triumph and radiant guitar lines, before closing out the record with the experimental solo piano piece ""Mirrored Palm"".</p><p>  Of course, while Wilderness are certainly unique, and prove themselves dynamic within their own strict parameters, a bit more variety wouldn't hurt, nor would more of the kind of melodic infusion found at the apex of ""End of Freedom"".  But considering the original sound they've created-- and at such an early stage of their career-- it's difficult to find too much fault: Even given this level of sonic consistency, the album only drags once, briefly, during the eight-minute centerpiece ""Post Plethoric Rhetoric""-- and that's at the beginning, before the track manages to get fully off the ground.</p><p>  What Wilderness really seem to signify-- and what makes them important-- is a shift back towards the more cerebral end of the rock spectrum.  Every extreme has its antidote, and just as it's been rewarding to see artists loosen up, enjoy themselves, and have some fun for once, it's also refreshing to hear them aspiring, just as passionately, to music of a more serious persuasion.  In an environment that's reveled so long in the comfortability of tradition and flavor-of-the-month transitiveness, this kind of substantive art-rock is ripe for exploration.  If Wilderness aren't quite kings of the mountain yet, it might just be that few others have yet traversed their fertile domain.</p><p> </p></div>"|8791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8791-wilderness/|8.5|Ryan Schreiber

The album draws on tracks from their two eponymous EPs and supplements them with newer material, and the seams show: There are three different lineups playing on the album-- mainstays Craig Extine and Scott Seckington and three different drummersÑand <em>Fallow Field</em> is a hodgepodge, albeit a self-conscious one: As one drummer replaces another, the sound changes noticeably, becoming less confident and distinct as the band struggles to find a comfortable balance of jerky rhythms, garage riffs, sludgy low end, and dark, often defiant lyrics.</p><p>  Recorded last year, the first six songs are the most recent, with Danny Sasaki of Mocket on drums. His tight, metronomic beats propel the riffs, keeping the songs reined in but allowing the band to make full use of the short running times. At just under two minutes, ""Poison Control"" is a quick burst of agitated guitars, but tracks like ""Clubs as Boots"" draw out longer, with Extine howling his fears like Tom Verlaine and Seckington switching between muddy guitar and percolating bass. As ""Deflect It"" nears its end, Extine shreds the melody to tatters as the rhythm section stoically chugs along. ""It's So Scandalous"" jitters like the DTs, airing its paranoia in tempo changes and Sasaki's revving-motor beats.</p><p>  After six songs, Natalie Cox, late of Popular Music, replaces Sasaki behind the drums for a run of four tracks that were recorded in 2002, and the switch is immediately obvious. Letting Extine's guitar and Seckington's complicated bass line lead the way, she rides her high hat throughout the songs, but the real change is in range and instrumentation. Leaving behind the tight, spare punk of the first songs, ""The Old World"" adds piano and organ to the mix, creating a fuller, more dramatic sound to match the song's gravity. Perhaps the album's outstanding track, it's a quiet hymn to regret and resistance that ends with stark self-loathing: ""If I had known what I know now I would have never left this life so slow,"" Extine seethes. ""I was getting old, a child that's grown cold/I shut my mouth and did as I was told.""</p><p>  Even when those ancillary instruments fall away, ""Gold Light"" still seems larger in scope and sound than the first section, albeit not as elemental. But the tempos slow to a trudge on ""Cult Baby"", and Cox's section of the album loses steam on her final song, ""You Could Never Know"", although this may be due as much to Extine's declining songwriting as to her drumming.</p><p>  For the final two songs, which were recorded in 2003, Chris Sutton of Dub Narcotic Sound System replaces Cox behind the kit. His drumming is harder and punchier, making ""Out of Sight"" and ""Vandal Hymn"" sound rawer and more aggressive than anything that precedes them. The section has the feel of an encore, as if recorded live in some smoky club, but it lacks the immediacy of the album's portion of the album and the drama of the second. If you can unspool the tangled chronology of <em>Fallow Field</em>, you'll discover a band in the process of finding itself, arriving at the point near where the album starts-- since these tracks were recorded, Curtis Phillips has taken over the kit from Sasaki, so who knows which of these three incarnations is most representative.</p><p> </p></div>"|6114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6114-fallow-field/|6.7|Stephen M.

Now I'm 
    spying sludgy, black clouds. The sun/storm transition and the promised
    precipitation presents a great setting for Om's <em>Variations on a Theme</em>, a heavy, diligently pure collection of stoned riffs focused on a
    Blakean skyward freedom quest.</p><p>
    Over the past few months, fans of stoic repetition have been feasting on
    new (or reissued) works by Earth, Sunn0))), and Orthrelm, among others.
    During this period of drone-made-flesh, Om's <em>Variations on a Theme</em>
    was released and has since served as one of my steadiest musical
    companions. It admittedly took a while for me to turn my appreciation 
    into words, and by now it's already common enough knowledge that 
    craggy toothed ex-Sleep guitarist Matt Pike joined forces with drummer
    Des Kensel and the inimitable low-ender Joe Preston in the unabashedly
    rockist High On Fire. Around the time <em>Blessed Black Wings</em> came
    out, Sleep's other two-thirds, the locked-groove rhythm section of
    bassist/vocalist Al Cisneros and drummer Chris Hakius, resurfaced as
    Om.</p><p>
    Om retains more of the Sleep vibe than High On Fire, essentially
    continuing along the lines of the Sabbathian one-track, 52-minute opus
    pocus <em>Jerusalem</em> (and its subsequent rebirth as the lenghtier, re-masted original <em>Jerusalem</em> demo recording, <em>Dopesmoker</em>), but with a tighter, jauntier step. Cisneros and
    Hakius don't bother replacing Pike with a new set of six strings: The
    two go it sans guitar and get even closer to the essence of Sleep's
    <em>raison d'\xEAtre</em>.</p><p>
    Gone also are the hempy lyrics à la Jerusalem's ""Drop out of life with
    bong in hand/ Follow the smoke toward the riff filled land."" I did a
    fairly close reading of the accompanying words (sung like Sabbath
    mantra) and the closest linkage I could find was ""seed."" The
    aforementioned theme of flight is instead evoked via stately salvos like ""to
    sun glides the albatross,"" ""the flight to freedom gradient raise the
    called ascendant,"" ""I climb toward the sun to breath the universal,""
    etc. God bless, Homer and all of this friends...</p><p>
    But whatever the pot percentage, the three gargantuan tracks clock in
    at 21:18 (""On The Mountain at Dawn""), 11:56 (""Kapila's Theme""), and
    11:54 (""Annapurna"") respectively, and the repetitious riffs flow
    plentiful. <em>Variations on a Theme is the ideal title: ""On The Mountain
    At Dawn"" sets the pace, ""Kapila's Theme"" slows it down and allows more space for tonal resonance (and a ""blue stoned moon"")
    as the protagonist walks toward a mountain and the horizon, and the
    climactic ""Annapurna"" shifts into more upbeat drumming (fills dart
    beside the cymbal) and crescendo. It's a buoyant resolution with
    lyrics that repeat time again until the final intonation of our High
    Priest: ""Lazarus advance the flight to freedom."" Amen.</em></p><p>
    This is niche listening: If you dig the aforementioned bands, this is up your sleeve. If you're concerned with 
    resolution, while <em>Variations on a Theme</em> is hypnotic (and even catchy), 
    it might not satisfy certain cravings: Icarus caught in sustained
    holding pattern, resulting in slow-release revelation rather than
    precipitous meltdown. Watch that fucker soar.</p></div>"|6115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6115-variations-on-a-theme/|7.8|Brandon Stosuy

The more your creature can remain concealed in the murky shadows just slightly off-camera, the longer you're able to distract from the fact that it's really just some bozo stagehand in a rubber mask.</p><p>
    
    This would appear to be a lesson well absorbed by the three noise-rock magi of Hair Police on <em>Constantly Terrified, the latest ghoulish onslaught in the group's rapidly expanding discography. On this album's four lengthy tracks, the trio of guitarist/vocalist Mike Connelly, percussionist Trevor Tremaine, and electrician Robert Beatty make more judicious use of unadulterated squalling cacophony than on past releases like 2002's </em><em>Blow Out Your Blood or 2004's </em><em>Obedience Cuts</em>. Here instead they place further discomfiting emphasis on clammy gooseflesh atmospherics while reserving their purest jolts of battery-acid intensity for those crucial moments that will inflict maximum listener trauma.</p><p>
    
    Hair Police make most skillful use of this dramatic modulation on the opening ""Rattlers Echo"", a craftily brutal track that originally appeared on a 3"" CD-R from the Chondritic Sound label. Belly-crawling beneath the acrid smoke of pulsing guitar, cutlery-rattling percussion and ominous, animal-- like electronic cries, the three achieve visceral, almost unbearable heights of tension before (spoiler alert!) finally letting loose just around the four-minute mark with a blindsiding ambush of wild, inhuman ferocity.</p><p>
    
    During the subsequent flesh-eating bacchanalia, the group's oft-noted debts to such noisy predecessors as Harry Pussy, Hanatarash, or Whitehouse become readily apparent. Impressive though this unmerciful maelstrom is, Hair Police extend the scene an unnecessary minute or two, and the track's furious, concentrated assault begins to crumble upon prolonged exposure to the sunlight.</p><p>
    
    Following this comes ""The Haunting"", a sweaty, throbbing wall of Hammer Films signifiers that joins faraway, disembodied shrieks to lurching, haunted castle groans and swirls of dry ice fog. Dense with feedback and untraceable electronic spirits, this piece amplifies the album's unsettling, claustrophobic mood, a gloom that is never lifted or resolved as the listener is instead forced to simmer in the trio's sickly vapors. This grim, faceless unease also permeates the set-closing title track, a 13-minute epic that stands as Hair Police's most finely-grained recording to date. Featuring unruly saxophone contributions from Wolf Eyes' John Olson, this piece seamlessly weaves between free-form BYG-Actuel jazz, dental drill electronics, and exaggerated, ungainly art-rock gestures. A fitting close to this morbidly addictive and compelling album, on this track Hair Police-- as with the sinister swinging pendulum on the album's cover-- wreak the most damage not through violent assault, but in the dreadful anticipation of the possible blows to come.</p></div>"|3984.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3984-constantly-terrified/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

    favorite young adult science-fantasy novel by T.A. Barron, a Marion
    Zimmer Bradley witch-story paperback I came across three minutes ago
    on Amazon, and of course, the rousing Diamond/Bacharach pop song. It
    makes sense that Joy Zipper would adopt the phrase, given their
    obvious debt to My Bloody Valentine's <em>Loveless</em>, the
    phosphorescent pink glow of which come closest to sonically
    approximating its compelling image. On <em>The Heartlight Set</em>,
    Long Island duo Vinny Cafiso and Tabitha Tindale continue to
    let that oneironautic influence shine in a greasy rainbow alongside
    Stereolab and the omnipresent <em>Pet Sounds</em>.</p><p>
    
    At the outset, Joy Zipper's latest looks to augur a slight shift.
    First track ""Go Tell the World"" all but sends up the band's frequent White Stripes comparisons (y'know, 'cause they're a couple) with Tindale's talky,
    blues-based vocals calling out over a swinging drum beat. Shortly,
    though, the typical swirly Shields-isms snuff the budding retro-rock
    in familiar shoegaze-era production values. The Belle &amp; Sebastian pop
    of ""Anything You Sent"" is another exception, veering dangerously close
    at the chorus to the ""come on, come on and dance all night"" section of
    Lovin' Spoonful's ""Summer in the City"". By the record's end, songs
    like horn-lightened ""World Doesn't Care"", catchy yet endlessly
    repetitive ""Rockdove"", and diaphanous, immersive finale ""Holy Driver""
    return to the band's status quo.</p><p>
    
    In their sonic appropriations, Joy Zipper most resemble Snow Patrol's
    polished <em>Final Straw</em>. Indeed, first single ""You're So Good"" has
    Tindale and Cafiso both sounding notably Lightbody-esque over simple,
    crunching guitars, and the lyrics share Lightbody's intra-relationship
    emotional space without his string-yanking specificity. Forthcoming
    single ""1"" is a catchy gray spot, laying Cafiso's unspectacular love
    poetry (""you're the one"") atop one of the recycled chord progressions
    that allowed 90s alt-rock radio to exist. A fizzy guitar lead during
    instrumental bits jumps straight out of the solo in Weezer's ""Across
    the Sea"", but the words are more Green Album.</p><p>
    
    My childhood <em>Heartlight</em> involved vast galactic struggles worthy
    of L'Engle, if not Lucas or, humph, Dubya. Joy Zipper's meticulous
    dream-pop is, similarly, in the realm of the tesseract-enabling
    science fantasy, but its emotional palette ranges mostly between
    kinda-melancholy (""Thoughts a Waste of Time"") and sorta-happy (""What
    You Want""-esque ""Window""). OK, there's also the incongruously tawdry
    ""For Lenny's Own Pleasure"" (that's Bruce, natch). No Diamond, though.</p></div>"|4304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4304-the-heartlight-set/|6.7|Marc Hogan

Ten years on, the popular favorite is obliterated, rethought, and generally mangled on this 20-track charity record. Compiled by Björk and ""Army"" co-writer Graham Massey, the schizophrenic disc features a slew of little-known acts from around the globe handpicked from hundreds of fan submissions. Though it must have been a beast of a task to whittle down the contenders to just 20, a more suitable 10 would have infinitely improved this often tedious exercise in song deconstruction.</em></p><p>
    Even at its most misguided, the album's diversity is astounding-- a fitting tribute to Björk's universality. I'll never forget the last time I saw her perform at a minor league baseball stadium in Brooklyn two years ago: To my left a 60-something grandma with her daughter, straight ahead a Latino family so touched by their hero they could barely look at her in between joyous sobs (it was a little creepy-- but poignant), and behind me a beyond-pale German inexplicably looking like a bespectacled, well-tailored Dickens character in the dead of summer.</p><p>
    The same unlikely juxtapositions are inherent on <em>Army of Me but each cover or remix's execution often saps the defiant energy out of its source material. Playing into the common cover-album blueprint, we get a token country translation from the Brixton-based Messengers of God, a slinky lounge version courtesy of France's Grisbi, three (too many) hard rock takes, and an accordion-only prank that basically defines the term ""novelty cover."" Even relative superstar Patrick Wolf (often hyped as ""Björk as a boy"") misfires with an utterly self-serious remix mired in arch industrialism.</em></p><p>
    Obviously, Björk is not the easiest singer to emulate, so the medal-bearers in this <em>Army</em> wisely embody her keen sense of abstract exhibitionism instead of her physical gifts. London-based harpist Tom Moth spearheads the group Lunamoth, who turn in a beyond creepy spine-tingler perfect for a David Lynch film or slow, poetic death under the eyes of a particularly bleak twilight. The group's choice to back their female, spoken-word reading with a heavily-effected, voices-in-the-head intercom echo eerily captures the internal struggle for self-sufficiency Björk yearns for. Danish group Atoi give the bombastic track a subtle and genuine <em>Vespertine</em>-style redux, with girlish vocals playing off blippy microsounds that pit and patter inside some igloo paradise.</p><p>
    Two danceclub-ready tracks blissfully capture the original's beat-based funkiness in very different ways. Germany's Beats Beyond remix the track by backing Björk's vocals with a distorted four-four crunch that recalls the whipping precision of fellow countrymen Alter Ego and their smash ""Rocker"". Seventeen-year-old Swede Tor Bruce strays from Ms. B's punishing sentiments entirely and bubbles-up with a ping-ponging happy-time anthem that could easily double as winner's circle music for any Mario Kart game. It's a throwaway for sure, but in the most delightful way possible, which, unfortunately, can't be said for the majority of this mostly middling, sometimes excruciating collection.</p></div>"|738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/738-army-of-me-remixes-and-covers/|3.8|Ryan Dombal

    Eyeball Skeleton's songs nick little pieces of rock history's past 30 or so years, hashing out enough of a guitar line or melody to support JJ and Charlie's antsy gang vocals. Run the water while listening to the instrumental ""Redfish"" and it's <em>Electr-O-Pura</em>-era Yo La Tengo covering Dinosaur Jr.'s ""Start Choppin'"". ""The Bouncing Apes"" picks out what's essentially an indie pop progression. Still, the song's really just a reason to make a truckload of goofy monkey noises, and there's nothing wrong with that. Throughout <em>#1 JJ and Charlie sing as if they absolutely cannot wait to get to the next lyric. But give our junior achievers a break-- you'd be excited too if your next line rhymed ""really spooky"" with ""kind of pooky."" That line's from ""Spooky Mummy Case"", a trash-rock ditty with a name you can just see oozing down your projection screen TV in bulbous Hanna-Barbera orange. A madcap pace, ancient runes, disembodied mummy sound effects-- ""Mummy Case"" is a better remake of the Scooby-Doo cartoons than anything starring Matthew Lillard and a CG pooch.</em></p><p>
    
    Some assembly has certainly been required for Eyeball Skeleton. The nine songs on this debut are simplistic, even rudimentary. But they're also crafty with a hook, and use every single trick of the lo-fi recording trade-- scraggly electric guitars matched by a generic drum machine beats, using the space underneath a faltering vocal to add character and depth, releasing <em>#1 on an pedigreed indie. So it's likely Bill Brown, JJ and Charlie's dad, deserves a hand. Hearing that, some will again point to the half-deflated Mylar gimmickry balloon. Yes, as if Eyeball Skeleton's trajectory from living room performances to local college radio sensations to gigs on ""Pancake Mountain"" to sharing roster space with Drums &amp; Tuba and French Kicks just has to be some sort of indie rock cashflow conspiracy. Right. Because that's how evil geniuses with big glasses and tight T-shirts spend their time. Of course Brown helped his sons out with arrangements-- they aren't even old enough to buy Rated T video games. Clamors for validity aside, </em><em>#1 is a pleasant summertime lark. And if that's all it is, then that's all it is. The title track's muddy riff (it's slowed-down from vintage DC hardcore) is the perfect frame for JJ and Charlie's layered harmonies, and their lyrics about skeletons on bicycles and boogey men are more charming than an entire platoon of lovelorn twee-pop charm police. At the very least their ""Flat Top Vampire"" will be the jam at your local iPod shuffle night.</em></p></div>"|2930.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2930-1/|4.9|Johnny Loftus

Then again, the reissue cottage industry has thrived on tracing the way familiar Western genres were circulated and re-imagined across the rest of the planet. Garage and punk could offer a DIY template for Japanese or Indian kids to get moving; psychedelic rock could swim out to Turkey and Thailand and collide with the ""exotic"" sounds it was already imitating; even the instant-globalism of dance music is constantly spitting out regional variants, from Israeli trance to baile funk.</p>
<p>And, as baile funk demonstrates, Brazil is a natural for mixing a variety of sounds, with a seriously musical culture that's already built on a constantly-shifting amalgam of influences -- African, Iberian, indigenous, ""Western.""

<p>The thrill, with this sort of thing, is always in the freshness of the results, and there's plenty of that on display in these two compilations-- from ultra-energetic funk on <i>Sexual Life</i> to the synth experiments of São Paulo goths on <i>Não Wave</i>. It'd be sheer cultural projection to imagine that the bands behind these tracks, outside of our Western limelight, just magically felt free to cut loose and let the creative urges flow; the politicization of Brazilian music goes at least as far back and the splits between Tom Jobim and Nara Leão, and I'd be willing to bet than in São Paulo, 1983, as anywhere else, there were kids in the back of the club bitching about how Agentss were totally five minutes ago. No, the freedom here is something else, and anyone expecting to hear the post-punk template meshing with Carnivalesque samba and the old violão will be mildly disappointed. The main difference is this: While the Western acts we'll compare these tracks to put a lot of energy into keeping fierce and conjuring up gloom, their Brazilian counterparts don't necessarily share that agenda. With the best of these artists, it seems like a lot of the template crossed the ocean as nothing more than a stylish, compelling sound-- something that could just as easily be attacked with a lot more joy and warmth.</p>
<p>Each compilation has similar estimations of who that ""best of these artists"" might refer to-- only three tracks actually overlap between them, but there's not much contention over the core acts. As Mercenarias were a spiky girl-group whose analogs (Slits, Liliput, Au Pairs) leave them sounding particularly accessible today; <i>Sexual Life</i> kicks off with two of their tracks, while <i>Não Wave</i> makes room for a one-minute rant. Then there's Akira S et as Garotas que Erraram, whose sound is accessible in a more surprising way, so effortlessly of-the-moment that piling on the references doesn't really help. (""Sobre as Pernas,"" on both discs, sounds to these ears like the dour early funk of A Certain Ratio meeting the hustling bass and synth wash of A Flock of Seagulls.) Fellini, smaller in scale but bigger in oddity, manage to score two cuts on each set, with a sparser pop/rock sound- -""Rock Europeu"" jangles confidently, but elsewhere it's minimal, drum-machined pop with a curious bedroom-built sound. And the two comps also share their rock-out moment, with a jaw-dropping entry from Muzak: ""Ilha Urbana"" is dark and quite casually fierce, with patterns of guitar noise shaping up and accelerating like This Heat or Bauhaus.</p>
<p>The differences between the discs are partly curatorial, and partly in the vibe built up around the bits they share. <i>Sexual Life</i> doubles up tracks on key artists-- Chance, Akira S, Smack, others-- and feels mixed for continuity: It kicks off with its most accessible pop and then swings, as befits a Soul Jazz product, into a midsection that piles on the funk. This is where the expected Brazilian touches come through, and where the genre splits off into something all its own. The complex polyrhythms and spazzed-out dance moves build their way to incredible levels of energy. One track's overhyped bounce and showy guitar solos sound almost like L.A. funk-metal, another offers post-disco party chants, others hustle and grind like Public Image Limited. With Patife and Gueto and Nau, percussion goes nuts, song structures hit metal-like levels of instrumental interplay, and the vocals shout to follow.</p>
<p>Whereas <i>Não Wave</i> coasts along in a vaguely more European pop mold. A band like Black Future might let out a little of that dark, bouncing funk, but for the most part these acts keep their hair stylish and their armpits dry; by the end, Voluntários de Pátria are borrowing XTC's ""Making Plans for Nigel"" riff for a loopy two-minute strut. This disc's center, in fact, exposes a vibe that just might be the polar opposite of <i>Sexual Life</i>'s-- edgy, stylish new-wave and moody, synth-assisted excursions for the São Paulo goths. Azul 29 sound more like Fad Gadget or Soft Cell than any guitar band, and Chance's sleepy ""Samba do Morro"". while on both discs, sounds more at home here. Bands like AKT and Ira! build up plenty of motion, but their particular sounds have more in common with the airy edges of Wire or Swell Maps or Siouxsie and the Banshees than the gut-level flash of <i>Sexual Life</i>'s selection.</p>
<p>Still, anyone overly struck by the difference in tone might just be reacting to the psychological spillover of the packaging-- vivid, jaunty yellow for Soul Jazz, classic black for Man Recordings, the German label issuing <i>Não Wave</i>. The bridges between the two are obvious enough, and it's a happy coincidence that they'd both appear at the same time. Both, really, get to offer something fairly splendid: Newly exhumed reissues that don't feel as if too much of their value is wrapped up in archival curiosity or music-elite tourism. Half of the fun with the standard post-punk canon is tracing out all the directions the anything-goes aesthetic had bands moving. These days, with ""post-punk"" narrowing down to describe a pretty rigid sphere, it's a treat to hear how that anything-goes worked somewhere else-- with a selection of tracks as exciting as any English reissue you might dig up.</p></div>"|11713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11713-nao-wave-brazil-post-punk-1982-1988-the-sexual-life-of-the-savages-underground-post-punk-in-sao-paulo-brasil/|7.9|Nitsuh Abebe

    bandwidth, mused upon the contrast between the Narrator's
    life-threatening live show and the unfulfilled potential of their
    <em>Youth City Fire</em> EP. They were a fairly new band, and seemed to
    be caught between the opposing poles of simpering emo and earsplitting
    turbo-punk. Such wavering is a severe liability for the EP's shortened
    format, which requires front-to-back head shots-- all kill no fill.</p><p>
    
    But whatever indecision plagued the <em>Youth City Fire</em> EP has
    mostly filtered out of the Narrator's audio onslaught in the course of
    the intervening year: After the feedback-laden madrigal that comprises
    the first minute-and-a-half of their debut full-length, the album
    proper begins with the bang of diesel-fueled chordage, careening drums
    and brazen shout-along vocals. The Narrator proceeds to subject their
    riffs and rhythms to  a series of spectacular secret grips that hardly
    relents until the humming dronefest that closes the record,
    ""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS"".</p><p>
    
    A combination of serrated texture and breakneck intensity is what
    makes this fairly conventional album stand out: Instead of the shock
    of the new, it imparts the shock of the awesome, as it's tough to
    reinvent a wheel that's jamming down a rutted road with redlining
    RPMs. The violence is pyrotechnically garish, and one pictures bending
    guitar necks, snapping strings, toppling cymbals, sparking and smoking
    amps, a sky full of fireworks. For those who miss Up-era Modest Mouse,
    with their concussive riffs, prickly harmonics, and canting
    string-bends, <em>Such Triumph</em> will give you a lot to think about
    on your next long drive. </p><p>
    
    ""Erase the sound!"" the singer sneers at the start of ""Pregnant Boys"",
    leaping headlong into a total ""Shit Luck"" lead (note-note-bend,
    note-note-bend) before the song levels out into a more muscled riff,
    flexing through unkempt intensity shifts. ""Ergot Blues"" is a Hot
    Snakes-style, no-bullshit rave-up that showcases the singer's newfound
    confidence by putting the vocals high in the mix. The skittering riff
    on ""Roughhousing"" hits the sweet spot, and ""Now is the Time for All
    Good Men"" lays a staccato telegraph atop tightly coiled melodic lead
    for a potent hitch-and-glide contrast. ""Wait No Actually"" and ""Wolves
    in the Walls"" are slower numbers that break the momentum in a way
    that's undesirable, but these feel like vestiges of a former identity
    crises. Instead of working out the kinks, the Narrator is working them
    in, and if their next record happens to feature even knottier guitars
    and more dangerous rhythms, that'd suit me fine. </p></div>"|5896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5896-such-triumph/|7.5|Brian Howe

    and Chris Goss (from Masters of Reality)? I don't think the band
    themselves could answer that, but that's also not the point: For as odd
    or predictable as this LP could have turned out, Goon Moon
    happily split the difference between experimentation and accessibility by not spending much time on either. One minute someone's
    whispering ""meow, kitty"" over abrasive squalls of guitar; the next,
    they sound like Queens of the Stone Age. None of these guises are ever
    fully explored, but <em>I've Got A Brand New Egg Layin' Machine</em> dips
    its toes in several styles while maintaining a campy Halloween vibe, and
    keeps things light through its most extreme moments.</p><p>
    
    Along with its diversity, it's the album's brevity that makes it so
    palatable-- it's attack one idea, get out, and go on to the next. ""Mud
    Puppies"" swings its stoner-rock riff like a mace behind ghostly chorus
    singers before dropping into industrial drones halfway through. If you're
    not watching, you'll probably miss the noise bleeding into ""Inner Child
    Abuse"", led by Hill's tight improvised pummeling on drums, which then
    railroad the transition into the ghoulish organ and corrosive guitar
    squeals of ""The Smoking Man Returns"". ""Rock Weird (Weird Rock)"", runs
    through scales over a stilted zombie march while a robotic voice chants
    ""weird rock, weird rock, weird rock, weird rock, rock weird, rock
    weird..."" (and I know, because they were thorough enough to transcribe those
    lyrics in the booklet. Thanks a shitload, guys.) The manipulated vocals
    continue through the perky folk strumming of ""Mashed"", then a announcer
    with a southern accent introduces the gothic surf rock of the title
    track. ""No Umbrellas"", one of only two songs with normal, unmolested
    vocals, moves through supercharged proto-punk guitar riffs with one-finger
    piano and handclaps, recalling the playful best of QOTSA. After all
    that, the traditional lift-yr-lighter closing ballad ""Apartment 31"" is
    somehow the strangest of the bunch.</p><p>
    
    The musicians of Goon Moon have made listenable record, while clearly
    unconcerned who listens to it. For fans of both indie and psychedelic
    rock, there's some reward, but the straddling of that line seems purely
    incidental. It's a short, strange trip, but it sounds like it was fun as
    hell to make and doesn't aim for anything more. Consider it the lighter
    side of indulgence from three talented and bizarre musicians.</p></div>"|3675.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3675-i-got-a-brand-new-egg-layin-machine/|6.3|Jason Crock

Or maybe they've just got massive sack.  Either way, their self-released, self-titled debut CD opens with the weirdest, most potentially grating bit of snake-oil salesmanship you're likely to hear until Tom Waits puts out another record.  I happen to dig the song, entitled ""Clap Your Hands!"" (a theme is emerging), but a maniacal carny barking over a stuttering calliope isn't for everyone.  Those who persevere, though, will quickly discover that this garish foyer gives out onto spacious, elegant chambers of clean lines and soft lights.</p><p>  Clap Your Hands are a five-piece from Brooklyn who're known to break out both harp and harmonica.  They've recently been garnering rave press in their home city, and, over just the past two weeks, burning up the internet like a vintage Lohan nipslip.  The pundits are saying Wilco (not hearing it), Talking Heads (okay), and Neutral Milk Hotel (getting warmer), but if it checks in with a number of modern and classic new wave referents, the music sings for itself: Clap Your Hands traffics in melodic, exuberant indie rock that pairs the shimmering, wafting feel of Yo La Tengo with a singular vocal presence that sounds like Paul Banks attempting to yodel through Jeff Mangum's throat.  Or imagine the Arcade Fire if their music were more fun-loving and less grave.</p><p>  Of course, if Clap Your Hands had a press kit, it would undoubtedly include something about ""synthesizing these influences into a sound that's uniquely their own.""  And for once, it would be true.  On the album's first true song, ""Let the Cool Goddess Rust Away"", a wailing vocal evokes Walkmen frontman Hamilton Leithauser, as hitching, muted guitars and singing melodic ones twist and furl over throbbing bass.  On ""Over and Over Again (Lost and Found)"", the band veers into more Interpol-ish territory, with small, stripped guitars and bass, a thin synth wash, and lilting vocals with woozily yawning vowels.  Same goes for the iridescent guitars, purring synths, and weary vocals of ""Details of the War"".</p><p>  The record is consistently, remarkably strong, but ""The Skin of My Yellow Country Teeth"" in particular stands out, with its richly buzzing synth phrases, textbook Modest Mouse guitar lead (a trebly, gliding string bend skimming over the rhythm like a flat stone over a pond), contrapuntal bass, and shuffling drums.  The song also features one of vocalist Alec Ounsworth's most memorable performances: He ramps up the urgency as the heavier chords kick in, his voice cracking and shifting in cascading waves as if someone were pressing his vocal cords to a fret board and bending them.  ""Is This Love?"", with its clean, galloping guitars and fruit loop synth trills is the song most blatantly redolent of Neutral Milk Hotel (especially of the unhinged pop and careening vocals Mangum favored on <em>On Avery Island</em>), and its dizzily wowing vocal harmonies carry over to ""Heavy Metal"", where fuzzed-out bass and wheezing harmonica punch smart shapes into the fizzy guitars.</p><p>  There's something really refreshing about stumbling across a great band that's trembling on the cusp without any sort of press campaign or other built-in mythology-- you actually get to hear the music with your own ears.  While a lot of bands view the promotional apparatus as a necessary evil, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah prove that it's still possible for a band to get heard, given enough talent and perseverance, without a PR agency or a label.  Indie rock has received a much-needed kick in the pants, and we have the rare chance to decide what a band sounds like of our own accord before any agency cooks up and disseminates an opinion for us.  Damn, maybe this is how it's supposed to work!</p><p> </p></div>"|1811.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1811-clap-your-hands-say-yeah/|9.0|Brian Howe

First, there's the name Black Sunday: Whether it refers to Thomas Harris (who wrote a novel of that name about a blimp crash) or to the Great Depression (a tremendous dust storm obliterated millions of acres on Sunday, April 14, 1935), the phrase evokes immense disaster, widespread destruction, and an aftermath of funereal grief.</p><p>  Then there's the fact the Black Sunday is essentially Alicja Trout, who previously sang and played keyboards and guitars for the Lost Sounds and has recorded with various one-off lineups and incarnations, including the Clears, the River City Tan Lines, the Fitts, and, most recently, Mouse Rocket. Aside from a few guest musicians (including former Lost Sound Jay Lindsay, who plays drums on two songs), Trout plays all the instruments and wrote all but one of the songs, so <em>Tronic Blanc</em> (which she recorded in her Memphis studio, called Tronic Graveyard) sounds like her most solo album-- and, in some ways, the best realization of her unique aesthetic.</p><p>  As such, <em>Tronic Blanc</em>'s technofear and paranoia-- not to mention its jaded resentment-- can be attributed solely to Trout. ""First, I cut my arms for you/ Then I cut my scars for you,"" she sings on ""Torture Torture"", with an immediacy that's chilling. Most of this personal angst surfaces in clone imagery-- not genetic regenerations, but mechanical substitutes. Songs like ""Torture Torture"", ""This Heart Is Now Aluminum"", and ""Modulated Simulated"" voice a very specific fear: That some enormous upheaval, like a bad break-up, will so overwhelm her that she might lose her emotional faculties and become a cold, metal-hearted machine.</p><p>  This panic is reflected in the music on <em>Tronic Blanc</em>, which pits live instrumentation against synthetic noises. On ""What I Think Is Wrong"", live drums compete with meowing keyboards, while on ""You're Gonna See Me"", real guitars counter canned beats. But Trout complicates that tension by making the drums sound preternaturally rigid and the guitars electronically sculpted, while her keyboard runs-- which have been a trademark at least since her days with the Clears (their one album is well worth seeking out and prefigures the current New Wave revival by almost a decade)-- often give the songs their heartbeat pulse. The line between the actual and the artificial constantly blurs, mirroring her confusion over real and false emotions. In a sense, Trout is Dr. Frankenstein and <em>Tronic Blanc</em> is the monster she's created in her studio lab.</p><p>  But complicating that literary comparison is the simple and overwhelming fact that despite the pain and fear the songs convey, Trout's music is exuberant, inventive, and full-to-bursting with ideas. As with previous projects, Trout's preferred m.o. is the restless, reckless conflation of genres: songs like ""This Heart Is Now Aluminum"", ""Modulated Simulated"", and ""Little Bird"" beat with garage-rock swagger and taut new wave grooves, while ""Destroy Everything in Your Path"" and ""Next Girl Detour"", with its shout-out chorus, swing with surf guitar momentum. Elsewhere, the DIY aesthetic lends ""Little Bird"" and ""On the Way Downtown""-- about the dangers of the Mississippi River-- their rough immediacy, as if Trout recorded them as soon as the ideas popped into her head. All these elements belie the grim undertones of <em>Tronic Blanc</em>, suggesting that simple expression can be not only catharsis, but a powerful defense against the dehumanizing disappointments of other people.</p><p> </p></div>"|1164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1164-tronic-blanc/|8.0|Stephen M.

Each pattern (or algorithm or gestalt, to use academic terms often applied to minimalist artwork) is small-- perhaps the size of your average metal riff-- and is self-contained. That is, each one relates to nothing outside of itself, and works through a ""predictably terminating"" process before moving on to the next. Which is still to say, <i>OV</i> is both a blueprint and the final result of a pretty amazing idea: hardcore minimalism in a rock context. Hardcore? Minimalism? This record, which could almost as easily be communicated via a series of 8x10-inch grids containing tiny, elaborate arrangements of points and lines, crosses a whole range of ""high art"" concepts. In fact, its ""rock context"" is more dubious than its artsy conceits, raising the question of whether electric guitars have to signify rock, or are capable of something else. Indeed, <i>OV</i> is something else.</p><p>
    
    In any case, isn't minimalism is supposed to be dead? That's what any art critic worth his pretension will tell you-- and has, on and off, for about 35 years-- despite the fact its remnants can be seen in almost every strand of art henceforth. Minimalist visual art happened as a result of simultaneous decisions made in the late 1950s by several young (and almost exclusively white male American) artists reacting against the wildly subjective Abstract Expressionist movement. Abstract expressionist artists like Jackson Pollack were about capturing personal experience or emotion in the purest, visceral sense. That's all well and good-- and sort of punk when you think about it-- but when Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman came along and did the same with broad planes of color and precisely defined geometrical shapes, it started to seem less a quasi-anarchic roar of purpose, and more a quasi-formalist one. So, rather than put forth subjective statements, the successive generation of artists aimed to produce art as object in and of itself, more apt to use mathematical formulas than emotional drive to create their works. This could manifest itself in anything from Sol Le Witt's math-generated sculptures, to Jo Baer's monochrome canvas-work to Dan Flavin's arrangement of neon lights on museum walls.</p><p>
    
    There was a concurrent ""movement"" in classical music towards minimalism, though unlike in the visual art critical establishment, nobody really made an effort to brand it as such. In the early 60s, La Monte Young, described by Brian Eno as the ""grandfather of us all"", was writing really slow, really lengthy pieces of chamber music in the serialist tradition (then the dominant strain of modern classical music, serialism is the organization of notes, rhythms, and other musical elements according to numerical formulae)-- perhaps the musical equivalent of painter Robert Ryman's <i>General</i> series of pure white paintings. Young soon moved to working with sine waves and drone performances that could last for days, or longer. However, you can't really release an LP of a weeklong performance, and a more popular, compact strain of minimalism was port forth by Terry Riley, who used tape loops and delay to concoct sprawling, repetitive soundscapes. He completed the landmark <i>In C in 1964, whose concepts led directly to a whole school of repetition-based music from which Steve Reich and Philip Glass (not to mention Neu! and Can) made a killing.</i></p><p>
    
    Until now, I would never have thought to compare Orthrelm to those musicians. The Washington D.C.-based duo's previous albums-- including an almost inhumanly fragmented, 99-track EP (!) <i>Asristir Vieldriox</i> from 2002-- were models of monolithic non-repetition. Guitarist Mick Barr (formerly of Crom-Tech) and drummer Josh Blair (also of math-jazzers ABCs) specialized in music obviously rooted in metal, but performed as a steady string of ultra-speed riffs and brittle patterns, thrown against each other in Pollack-like collage: no clear linear progression, but when viewed from a distance, as technically impressive as it is chaotic. John Zorn's Naked City is a precedent, as Orthrelm recall the intensity of the fastest hardcore punk, and the virtuosity of the gone-est conservatory shredders-- not to mention being pretty light on their feet. However, if you wanted jams with beats and wailing choruses, you were out of luck; the band played alien etudes, but not necessarily ""rawk."" But if fans were left wanting something easier to tap along with, the band's latest delivers the goods in spades.</p><p>
<i>OV</i>, containing a single 45-minute composition, makes as good an introduction to putting oneself into a trance as it does to minimalism or instrumental prog. Although recorded over a period of months, the title piece is presented as a single performance, each segment locking into the next, on and on until everything simply stops. And just as I described Orthrelm's prior releases as monolithic, this one threatens to glaze over the eardrums of anyone not particularly fascinated by the prospect of a metal mosaic, massive in size with attention to minute detail. Yet, it is the attention to detail-- the baroque refinery of the individual riffs and drum patterns-- that makes <i>OV</i> more than just an impressive technical feat (or an excruciating bore). As with the additive, metric modulation of Glass (who cribbed his technique from Indian raga) or Reich's rhythmic phasing, Orthrelm somehow makes music more than the sum of its innumerable parts.</p><p>
    
    At the heart of <i>OV</i> are adrenaline and discipline; abandon and meditation. I'm tempted to recommend the album to anyone interested in learning how to meditate; beyond the sheer length and precision of the music, I wonder if Barr and Blair had to put themselves in some kind of Zen state just to record the stuff. As the passages fly by-- beginning with the pounded tritone introduction, to a diced three-note guitar motive and tom-toms cascade, to sections featuring the thrash of cymbals and high-range dissonance alternating with sections where the drums drop out entirely and guitar lands on sustained, sine-like tones-- I look for inter-connections. Unlike traditionally minimalist music, <i>OV</i>'s structure follows an ""A to B to C"" path, rather than the less intrusive (but arguably more subtle) ""A1 to A2 to A3"" method of Glass and Reich. On this record, each pattern takes on its own identity, seemingly unrelated to anything happened before-- yet, the speed and consistency of attack (Barr's fingers must be robotic) serve to blur the edges of what might otherwise sound disjointed.</p><p>
    
    I'm not sure history's great minimal artists would approve of <em>OV, on the structural grounds I noted above, or due to the fact that Orthrelm's music just seems so, well, <i>big</i></em>. Of course, Frank Stella's grid-like aluminum paintings were as tall as people, while some of the great single-artist installations of the 60s and 70s could take up entire galleries, so you never know. Ultimately, this record stands as a towering achievement in its own right, regardless the context you visualize. And maybe this many words are overkill for what I'm really trying to say: This is fucking great.</p></div>"|6113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6113-ov/|8.5|Dominique Leone

    intimately familiar with changes. First he was in this
    band called Slint; apparently they were some kind of big deal. Ditto
    Tortoise. And as a solo artist under the guises of M, Papa M, and
    Aerial M, Pajo has quietly staked out territory at the
    nexus of pastoral folk and minimal electronica. He is a dim yet
    essential star in a musical constellation that includes Leonard Cohen,
    Iron and Wine, and Windsor for the Derby. Given his retiring demeanor
    and the subtlety of his solo work, everyone was thrown for a loop when
    he hooked up with the Great Pumpkin to glam out with Zwan. We
    all know how that turned out. After washing off his stage makeup and
    shaking the glitter out of his hair, Pajo is back in the murky, spare
    musical environment where he seems more at home: His new solo LP,
    recorded under his own name this time (reaffirmation of identity after
    hanging with the ego-devouring Corgan?), picks up more or less where
    <em>Whatever, Mortal</em> left off.</p><p>
    
    Pajo's solo output has stayed within fairly narrow stylistic
    borders, but he's made minute adjustments in style and
    personnel. We talk about evolution when an artist makes a drastic
    change from one album to the next, but Pajo's growth seems more
    faithful to the spirit of the word: A slow, incremental process of
    refining and tweaking-- natural selection rather than rampant mutation.
    This time, he used a bare-bones recording process that enhances the
    aura of mystery surrounding his enigmatic meditations, producing the
    album with cheap software that came with his laptop and singing
    directly into the computer's microphone. Sounds sketchy on paper, but
    it works: If you're familiar with Pajo's music, you know he needs
    fancy production like Corgan needs a hairnet, and the hissy,
    unfettered recording makes the songs sound like decaying artifacts.</p><p>
    
    Still, <em>Pajo</em> requires a few passes before the songs begin to
    differentiate and expand: Pajo's voice is a gray, remote apparition
    that tends to shade into a hoarse whisper. It's remarkably placid and
    still, and has a strange negating effect that can only be described as
    audible silence, if you'll forgive the abstraction. Forgoing
    instrumentals this time in favor of shimmering, spectral folk with
    electronic dressings, the eerie quietude does not relent, from the
    initial skittering dirge ""Oh No No"" to the final spoken-word echo
    chamber ""Francie"", even on the borderline rocker ""Baby Please Come
    Home"". This record doesn't intend to blow your hair back; it wants to
    get under your skin, and with its twinkling arpeggios, morbidly
    graceful lyrics, and barely there electronics, slowly, it does. </p></div>"|6575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6575-pajo/|7.3|Brian Howe

For example, there's the three-chord wheeling, leather-studded punk mavens still preaching musical recklessness and revolution; the mascara-caked new wave gatekeepers now grown-up and working in accounting, still convinced Robert Smith and Morrissey are speaking directly to them; and your techno buffs, who just want things to stay the way they were-- in the year 2412. All are somewhat misguided in their attempts at genre preservation, but none foul it up like the hardcore blues camp. Isn't <em>real blues supposed to be about dungarees, crafting guitar slides from beer bottles, and literally selling your soul to the devil, <i>not</i> the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin?</em></p><p>
    
    I bring this up because Lincolnshire's 22-20s (named after a classic Skip James blues song) have accrued more blues cred than BRMC, the White Stripes, and the Kills with their self-titled debut, an offering that seemingly reaches back only to Britain's 1960s usurpation of American blues. However, to actually gauge the blues ""purity"" of any blues-rock artist today would be pointless. Time would be better spent trying to prove ""1"" is closer to infinity than ""0"" than comparing modern bands' faithfulness to Robert Johnson or Muddy Waters. And that's just fine, because blues would still be a derelict in contemporary music if not for some harmless blaspheming.</p><p>
    
    Not surprisingly, the 22-20s' potency is inversely proportional to their incorporation of traditional blues. Sure, Rolling Stones and CCR are jumping-off points, but the auxiliary genre hopping really makes these songs sizzle. ""Shoot Your Gun"" and ""Such a Fool"" sneak in (gasp!) Beatlesque melodies and catchy Cheap Trick cock-pop. Despite its sapless lyrics (""I'm getting bored/ Of putting on a smile""), ""Baby Brings Bad News"" channels smarmy Britpop, hitting up mid-90s Blur for a wispy, piano-driven chorus. Exempting these three tracks, however, the band shrinks back into its shell, relying on automated blues-rock.</p><p>
    
    Both ""Why Don't You Do It for Me"" and ""I'm the One"" are centered around a knee-slappin' blues lick, but botch opportunities to deliver an equally vibrant chorus and bridge, one of blues rock's most sacred cows. Then there's the rest, which is mostly rehashed Dylan and Fogerty, some innocuous Stevie Ray Vaughn knockoffs, and ""The Things That Lovers Do,"" a laughable regurgitation of Pearl Jam's ""Black."" Yes, <em>NME's simultaneously shitting and pissing themselves, but the 22-20s evade most of the typical British rock potholes (i.e. histrionics, pretentiousness, unapologetic 60s-aping, among others), and can actually be taken at face value. Now if we could just touch-up the blemishes on that face...</em></p></div>"|8296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8296-22-20s/|6.6|Adam Moerder

    exceedingly strange bill for New York, a city of typically
    cohesion-minded clubs. NNB played a long, noodly set that had me
    going, ""c'mon, man,"" but also, ""wow, that drummer's good,"" and, ""I
    hope my girlfriend, who clambered here on a sprained ankle, doesn't
    kill me."" The crowd tolerated opener Brother Ali-- the First Cracker
    of Minneapolis hip-hop-- but by the time NNB reached closer and
    <em>UFO</em>-standout ""Show Me Your Heart"", I was surrounded by khaki-clad
    thirty-somethings yelling, ""GO HOME FAGS!"" in between beer sips.</p><p>
    
    Maybe getting jeered out of the Bowery was a humbling experience for
    the assertively strange Philly sextet, but chances are it wasn't a
    unique one, and if <i>Where's Black Ben?</i> is any indication, the hecklers
    only egg them on, pushing their music into starker, more obnoxiously
    goofy territory. And here they play provocateurs, aiming less to please those who dig than
    offend those who diss.</p><p>
    
    In the barbate world of spazzcore, Need New Body aren't the best
    songwriters, or even the best musicians. Those titles go to Polysics
    or Man Man or Hella or Bablicon, depending on whom you ask.
    Need New Body's greatest assets are their most glaring deficiencies: a
    remote live presence; their albums' lawless lack of direction; and
    general, galling immaturity. (Check their website for a truly
    brain-curdling experience.) But when these aspects go untempered by,
    say, a general interest in writing music, the resultant drool is a bad
    trip.</p><p>
    
    Last we heard from these crazies, they were drowning nuggets of
    oddball synth-pop in oceans of noise filler on 2003's <i>UFO. One assumed
    (hoped) subsequent efforts would see them grow more discerning, not
    less. Ha ha, no. On </i><i>Where's Black Ben?</i> NNB shrug off their quondam
    melodic sleight like a bad hangover. While not lacking in
    catchiness, the album's hooks leave a funny aftertaste. Take opener
    ""Brite Tha Day"", whose retarded, geek emcee verses (""All the girlies
    get horny when I pick up the mic"") are almost forgiven by an adorable
    kids' hour chorus. Almost, but Jeff Bradbury's over-the-top vocals beg
    you to laugh first, sing along second-- a condescending listener
    cooperation exercise with little incentive to comply.</p><p>
    
    Banjo strutters ""Poppa B"" and ""Peruvidia"" show touching sincerity
    (blame the wistful stringed instrument), but the feeling is more
    relief than enjoyment. Only on ""So St Rx"" does it all fall into place:
    Deigning to add melody to a lighthearted narrative about dead-end
    Philly kids (""'Oh, I'm hungry.' 'Really? Cool!' 'I dunno, you want
    souvlaki?'""), the band achieve synthesis. But whenever they appear to
    be hitting their stride-- such as on the brilliant, Sun Ra-homaging
    ""Outerspace""-- it's right back into whackhead mode. Petrified of
    normalcy-- something they couldn't achieve if they tried-- Need New
    Body undermine their own talents, and <i>Where's Black Ben? offers little
    else but fodder for our epithet-slinging Hold Steady listener to dine
    out on.</i></p></div>"|5734.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5734-wheres-black-ben/|5.6|Sam Ubl

    touchstone for psych heads, but they're often
    snubbed in scene round-ups and other psychedelic primers. If
    discussed at all, mentions barely move beyond
    standard-issue guitar freak-out metaphors. Worse, the two are spoken
    of in the past tense.  It's particularly surprising that their
    excellent current project, Major Stars, hasn't noticeably benefited from the renewed interest in Blue Cheer raucousness
    and distended fret shredding. They <em>did</em> collaborate on Live In
    Europa, a split LP with Comets on Fire, but otherwise seem to be
    shuffling along a murky path toward underground respect sans popular
    recognition.</p><p>
    
    The trip started when Rogers formed Crystallized Movements with
    drummer Ed Boyden in 1980, while the two were still in high school.
    Biggar (aka Kate Village) joined Rogers a few years later and ever since the two have created some of the best underground
    American guitar music of our time while also running run the Cambridge-based
    Twisted Village label/record store. High points have been Magic Hour
    (with Galaxie 500's Damon and Naomi as rhythm section)
    and any number of Rogers' darkly plaintive and wailing solo albums.
    There are also raw spin-offs like Bongloads of Righteous Boo,
    Heathen Shame, Vermonster, and Wormdoom.</p><p>
    
    After Damon and Naomi left Magic Hour to focus on their Exact Change literary
    press and eponymous folk, Rogers and Biggar formed Major Stars with
    bassist Tom Leonard (aka the equally underrated Luxurious
    Bags) and drummer Dave Lynch (Vermonster). The new rhythm section
    offers a heavier center than Damon &amp; Naomi, who stitched a beautifully diaphanous undertow. Until now, the quartet's best effort was 2002's <i>Distant Effects</i>. But 25 years into the
    game, Rogers and Biggar have here turned out some of their best work yet.</p><p>
    
    With Rogers/Biggar, you rarely get much fanfare: Despite their lavish guitar playing, these folks come off spartan: <em>4 is their fourth album and it contains
    four songs. On
    the other hand, it's also Major Star's first album put to tape in a
    24-track studio-- and the increased fidelity is a revelation. When played loud enough, it </em><em>almost matches the awe-inspiring feeling of their live shows.</em></p><p>
    
    The session is from July 2003, and boasts phenomenal
    guitar licks, extended and acrobatic soloing, a dense and smoky (but
    also chilly and somehow pristine) atmosphere, and Wayne Rogers'
    shadowy voice, which is best described as deep, inked, and syrupy. It
    reminds me of constellations seen through dead New England trees. Or if J Mascis were a monk and not a stoner.</p><p>
    
    I'm usually a big stickler for lyrics, but have never paid too much
    attention to what Rogers' is intoning. In general, what matters more than a libretto is how he breathes
    and tumbles between the guitars. On ""All Or Half The Time"", he lulls with beautiful melancholia while the guitars
    provide high-level fireworks. Then comes the alternately
    lulling/blistering/nimble and everything in between 13-plus minute
    instrumental ""Song For Turner"", and it's clear why the words don't
    much matter. Remarkably, unlike Comets On Fire or other band's they've helped spawn, the soloing is never harsh: Even when there's a storm
    of feedback, it always feels like a pillow.</p><p>
    
    But a pillow proffered doesn't mean you'll sleep. This is the
    music of revelation and throwing off the sky's geometry; it maintains
    a heavy feeling of night, but more like sweaty 3 a.m. epiphany. If
    Kieran
    Hebden hadn't already grabbed <em>Everything Ecstatic for his new Four
    Tet offering, the name could've served as the less modest title for
    this
    glorious mountain of sky-melting psychedelia. There, I said it.</em></p></div>"|5653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5653-4/|8.2|Brandon Stosuy

    ""everyone who bought one became a record critic"" variant seems more apt.  For my money, the best thing ever written about the
    Velvet Underground remains this bit from Rob Sheffield's entry in the <i>SPIN Alternative Record Guide</i>: ""We understand this
    music so well because every corner of it has been absorbed.  VU studio goofs have become established sub-genres.""</p><p>
    
    It's true.  From the time they disbanded, the Velvet Underground have been present in most skewed versions of rock, from
    glam to punk to new wave to noise.  If you only considered that Kraftwerk, Can, and David Bowie idolized and borrowed from VU,
    and think about all the places their music has traveled, well, that covers an insane amount of geography right there.  Indie
    rock, in particular, is unthinkable without them, so it feels a bit odd to be reviewing a double-disc set of their best work
    for Pitchfork: Chances are, you've already internalized the four albums proper and <i>Live 1969</i>, and could tell me quickly
    which 30 songs are your all-time favorites.  Needless to say, this compilation wasn't designed with the average Pitchfork reader
    in mind.</p><p>
    
    What it was designed to do-- and what it does rather well-- is replace 1989's <i>The Best of the Velvet Underground: Words and Music
    of Lou Reed</i>, an awkwardly titled, coldly assembled sampler that was in print far too long.  <i>Gold</i> is two discs selling for
    a single disc price, and it includes almost all of the best-known and most often covered songs in their catalog: nine of 11 songs
    from <i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i>, three of six from <i>White Light/White Heat</i>, five of 10 from <i>Velvet Underground,
    and three live versions of the 10 songs from </i><i>Loaded.  The two unreleased collections <em>VU</em></i> and <i>Another View</i> are
    also well represented, and two songs from Nico's <i>Chelsea Girl</i> are included, as well.</p><p>
    
    Someone with $14 to spend who hasn't heard a note of this is in for a ride.  Personally, I've had a hard time getting past ""Sister
    Ray"", which has the most gloriously filthy combination of guitar, organ, and amps ever assembled in one room.  I just want to keep
    hitting the ""back"" button.  But it's also been nice to revisit the shrieking viola of ""Venus in Furs"", which alarmed me when I first
    heard it so many years ago but now just sounds darkly sensual and almost playful.  Hearing the heavy stuff next to twee bits like
    ""Sunday Morning"" and ""I'll Be Your Mirror"", which stand up beautifully, only affirms the staggering range of this band, as exemplified
    in the Sheffield quote above.</p><p>
    
    The more I think about their range, the clearer it becomes why the Velvet Underground are so difficult to anthologize for listeners
    who want to understand the full scope of what made them important.  Their albums really are albums, and you need to hear the great
    songs next to the less accessible ones to get a full picture of the band.  You gotta sit through ""European Son"" to hear how crazily
    noisy they could get and plod through ""The Gift"" to understand how badly they wanted their music to be taken as seriously as
    literature.  And hey, how can a 30-song collection of Velvet Underground songs not include any Moe Tucker leads?  Reed and John
    Cale provided the cool and Nico was around a while for the beauty, but the Velvet Underground picture is so must more interesting
    when you consider that this sweet-voiced woman occasionally took the mic to sing a simple ditty.  Still, where summarizations of
    their catalog are concerned, <i>Gold</i> is easily the best yet, and while aspiring music fanatics will want and need all of the
    band's individual full-lengths, this should suit the rest of the world just fine.</p></div>"|8436.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8436-gold/|9.3|Mark Richardson

Go swimming, catch fireflies...hell, even go to Lowe's and buy those plastic tiki torches that give suburbanites the illusion they're constantly in the Carribbean, because British folk duo Turin Brakes's third album <i>Jackinabox</i> wants <i>you to enjoy your summer, at any cost. The duo's declared jihad on anyone who dares cast a cloud over their picturesque summer afternoon, and if you think they're joking, the lyrics to ""us vs. them"" R&amp;R; anthem ""They Can't Buy the Sunshine"" should fortify their radical fundamentalist approach to leisure: ""They burned our churches to the ground/ But they can't buy the sunshine.""</i></p><p>
    
    Lyrics like these have been just one part of the mystery that is Turin Brakes's success. They use safe folk-pop arrangements, exude a feel-good Simon and Garfunkel vibe, and write dewy-eyed words, yet have enjoyed a surprisingly warm reception from even the most miserly of reviewers. Not even fellow British softies Coldplay can make that claim. Unfortunately, <i>Jackinabox</i> pulls the rug out from this improbable run (or at least gives it a good tug), as here troubadours Ollie Knights and Gale Paridjanian sound as languorously adult alternative on the record as they appear on paper.</p><p>
    
    Turin Brakes separated themselves from similarly delicate UK bands Athlete and Travis by avoiding unvarying, schmaltzy vocals-- and on the first parts of <i>Jackinabox</i> that distinction holds true. With its campfire cooing and rugged chord changes, ""Red Moon"" is Elliott Smith on Zoloft, climaxing with the excusably optimistic chorus ""If you try, you'll be alright."" However this formula exhausts itself on forgettable numbers like ""Forever"" and ""Above the Clouds"", where humdrum acoustic strumming and stagnant melodies form a stale film over Knights' and Parijanian's consistently colorful harmonies.</p><p>
    
    In between these two extremes, Turin Brakes throw it on cruise control. ""Asleep With the Fireflies"" putzes through a Van Morrison template of a verse before launching into a funk-tinged country jamboree. ""Road to Nowhere"" and ""Buildings Wrap Around Me"" tap Nick Drake at his most bittersweet, but serve only as worthwhile fillers. In a sense Turin Brakes do little wrong on <i>Jackinabox</i> aside from the occasional gooey outbursts of gaiety. Though these good vibes grow monotonous, and even on downer ""Last Clown"" (""Last clown drinking in a bar that's about to be closed""), Knights can't hide the pep in his voice. But hey, maybe in this world of bleak Nick Hornby novels and cliffhanging mini-series drama, we need a definitively happy piece of work beginning to end. If not, I think I found the perfect Father's Day gift.</p></div>"|8189.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8189-jackinabox/|6.5|Adam Moerder

    Hi to Your Mom could well have been written by the one-man emo band's
    one man, Eric Elbogen. According to a Knight-Ridder article, Elbogen
    writes rock reviews under a pseudonym ""so he doesn't alienate labels
    he might want to partner with down the road"". Who knows, he might be
    writing these words <em>right now</em>. Or not: I took the L train to Bedford
    for the first time just Saturday night, but Elbogen already had a song
    about it and other yuppie-hipster touchstones on last year's
    <em>Numbers &amp; Mumbles</em>.</p><p>
    
    Home recordists today, unlike early-90s Sentridoh or even late-90s
    White Town, have enough technology at their fingertips to sound major,
    in that
    ""indie-rock""-is-the-new-""alternative"" kind of way. A certain careerism is sweeping even the once-artiest
    loft apartments. As a result, ""style is taking over,"" in the sardonic
    words of Say Hi's sonic forebear, Pedro the Lion's David Bazan, and
    songs are on the outs. Hence, Say Hi's arrangements happen to become
    less sugary (lo-carb craze?) and more darkly Arcade-Fire-anthemic on
    the outfit's third record, <em>Ferocious Mopes</em>-- especially on
    wistful, quiet-loud ""Dimensions and Verticals"" and ""The Twenty-Second
    Century"". How convenient.</p><p>
    
    On a homemade
    PC, Elbogen assembles slow, statuesque, self-consciously ""indie"" rock
    with analog synthscapes, overlapping distorted guitars, lots of
    low-end, and Conorrifically quavering whispers. Lyrically, he makes
    two classic misapprehensions: quirkiness for originality, and
    sincerity for significance. So ""Poor Pete Is a Bit Self-Conscious""
    tells the tale of a would-be vampire over a stomping arena beat, while
    ""Recurring Motifs in Historical Flirtings"" (yep, that's the title)
    rides the chilly-synths-are-rad-again trend to label ""let's just be
    friends"" ""the four worst words in our language"". Boo hoo hoo.</p><p>
    
    Frustratingly, Elbogen would have genuine potential if he spent as
    much time on songwriting as on being fashionable. ""Yeah, I'm in Love
    With an Android"" is movingly odd, and the too-brief acoustic closer
    ""As Smart as Geek Is Chic Right Now"" stabs deeper than its look-at-me
    title to describe the misfortune of toys accidentally given brains.
    ""Let's Talk About Spaceships"", from <em>Numbers &amp; Mumbles</em>, is an
    all-the-right-notes ballad of 21st-century insecurity that could
    please fans of either Grandaddy or, gulp, Jimmy Eat World. Which
    reminds me: ""Marc Hogan"" is really just Jim Adkins' pen name.</p></div>"|7814.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7814-ferocious-mopes/|4.8|Marc Hogan

Their
    disgorged sounds feel roughly metal, but there's something else
    coursing through and fucking with the template: Check out the buried
    vocals, the guitars stacked like whirlpools, the elastic bridges that
    give and take without proper crescendos, and just the general
    hybridization via all those shoegaze elements.</p><p>
    On <i> Oceanic Remixes / Reinterpretations</i>, the Los Angeles-by-way-of-Boston quintet fill two CDs with
    composers, rockers, and knob-turners twiddling with and reforming
    their 2002 full-length, <i>Oceanic</i>. Originally a series of 12"" singles this
    compilation gathers the entire run, including a varied cast from
    Atomsmasher/Khanate dude James Plotkin (who turns-in a lovely, dank
    ""The Other"") to the Oktopus from Dälek (who opens an Atari 2600 Pandora's
    Box on ""False Light""). As would be expected, if you like Isis you
    won't necessary like this album, and vice versa.</p><p>
    Remixes are tricky. No matter who's providing source material,
    questions inevitably arise amongst some listeners: Can the
    remix stand by itself? Or is the value of the material in seeing how sources are
    rearranged into endless permutations? I'm of
    the thought that the originals don't much matter-- I imagine these echoes and drones as new formations and see if they
    float. So there have been
    times I've liked the rewrites more than the originals. More often, in
    spite of myself, I listen to the second drafts and consider why this
    or that interpreter went one way or the other, still considering it in
    tandem with the starter material.</p><p>
    Here, most of the tracks I enjoyed plucked a single thread from the
    original and found a way to weave it into a new nest elsewhere.
    Christian Fennesz's implosion of ""Weight"" transforms the track into a
    weightless homunculus. (It sounds like a teeming, contoured, elegant
    Fennesz song.) Tim Hecker's ""Carry"" tosses various textual shifts
    over a fluctuating bed of drone; tiny percussive ripples glitch out at
    the end. Some find new corners and angles left open for invasion and
    then tearing the original blueprint apart: Mike Patton, whose Ipecac
    label released <em>Oceanic as well as its successor, <i>Panopticon</i>,
    transforms ""Maritime"" into a gypsy's quake-basket circus romp hosted
    by crotchety Mr. Bungle beside a plastic kiddie pool.</em></p><p>
    On the other hand, there are too many un-intriguing instances like
    Venetian Snares' ""The Beginning and the End"" and DJ Speedranch's
    ""Carry: Like I Will Love Her Forever?"" (Fuckin Die!!!),"" which come
    off like slightly fractured alterna-metal. Other mixes dull: Aaron Turner's
    vocals are usually buried, so a few decide to make them resurface
    super upfront. And it's here that I imagine Isis sounds most like the
    haters want them to: flat, fairly generic, and totally not mysterious.</p><p>
    The one participant to up ante is JK Broadrick of Jesu and Godflesh.
    Yoking delay and echo to ""Hym"", he extends the track by over five
    minutes and appends unforeseen movements. The general opening triumph
    remains largely in tact, but he dampens the drums, doubles certain
    passages, equalizes, and transforms it into a loping choral dervish.
    Then, pulling out the rug, he removes space between the drum hits,
    warping crescendos into a frantic seasick sluice. Later-- because the
    track warrants notations of the passage of time-- the vocals turn
    especially raw bloody. (Vocals sprout where they didn't exist in the
    original.) The final few minutes build a raft of harmonic acoustics
    that float placidly alongside a vocal drift.</p><p>
    The author John Barth wrote a piece once about how a writer should
    avoid using epigraphs that are better written than the book they
    precede. This in mind, the Isis curators wisely stick Broadrick's
    ""Hym"" in the final slot of Disc Two. If it came earlier, everything in
    it's wake would seem lame and mundane. As is, the coda adds a bit
    of last-minute revelation.</p><p>
    I guess that's another reason folks remix rock records:
    By rescuing even a single element previously buried or turning down
    something upfront, you fuck with the song's hierarchy and allow the
    shock of the new to slip right on in. It's like remaking a memory.</p></div>"|11762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11762-oceanic-remixesreinterpretations/|6.2|Brandon Stosuy

Because really that's what we got here: Tracks like ""Mina Loy (M.O.H.)"" and ""DIA"" cough up all the proven pink noise progressions, hot drums pushed back in the mix, so-called lush layers of guitar distortion, an acceptable vocal melody, frothing overdrive, etc. Even the single ""Walking Shade"", however hookless and octave-bass trendy as electro-funk (think the Killers, then thank mixing boy Alan Moulder), still sounds enough like New Order at times that, hey, things are gonna be fine-- one less Out Hud song on the radio.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Billy Corgan's changed a few lives in his time, which makes it difficult for some people (me, at least) to have any sense of the song's musical merits before their brains pavlov. For a time, Smashing Pumpkins were tops; in my neighborhood alone, dressing up for Halloween as the Asian Guy From Smashing Pumpkins was a politically acceptable if not publicly applauded costume choice. So was making your own ZERO shirt, and locking yourself in your locker, despite all your rage.</p>
<p>So there are, in fact, two ways <i>The Future Embrace</i> can, will, and possibly should be read. The first is, like I said, as just another shoegaze record with some/many lyrical missteps (a teaser: ""On the ninth day God created SHAME!!!!!!!""). The second: Although Pumpkins fans enjoy explaining to their peers how, actually, Corgan recorded most of <i>Siamese Dream</i> himself, etc., <i>The Future Embrace</i> really is his first solo record. He's dropping the ruse of band co-operation, and, however much it's often untrue, asking us to read his songs to be at least partially autobiographically. Officially, Corgan no longer represents Smashing Pumpkins (or Zwan), just himself, and the solo run implies a certain interest in showing his true face to those who want to see it.</p>
<p>""All Things Change"" has loveful guitars and flimsy drums and really nasally vocals. But for the Corganites this is The Artist justifying his return, explaining his motives for disbanding the Pumpkins, putting faith in pop music, and steeling himself in a way that, if we're buying into the song as a personal account, is kinda sorta affecting. The song's last line, ""We can change the world,"" is cliche, sure, but so is ""I love you"" to your girlfriend, and ""I can't believe I'm doing this"" to yourself before the virgin line-- what matters more is Corgan's saying it.</p>
<p>So, forgive Corgan his infinite lyrical badness, but know that infinity's a lot to forgive. ""You are love/ You are soul/ You are real to me"" is bad, approaching the level of ""Can I give my old heart TO YOU!!!!!!!"", also a line from <i>The Future Embrace</i>. In fairness, I don't remember what I was thinking exactly when I first heard something like, ""I torch my soul to show/ The world that I am pure,"" stuff like that. Anyway, while that line from ""Rocket"" seems intentionally poetic, <i>The Future Embrace</i> doesn't seem to aspire to the craft's inherently mediated affair. This is Corgan talking candidly to the mirror, a recording for himself and interested fans, but a big fuck-you to anyone who never cared in the first place. I can't reward that, but I think I get it: When we talk to ourselves about stuff, most of us don't think in necessarily poetic terms-- we just think what we feel. Granted, I've never said something like, ""Every time I start reaching out to find you/ Loneliness abounds,"" but you get the point.</p>
<p>Tonally and compositionally, <i>The Future Embrace</i> is either samey or consistent depending on your mentality, but Corgan throws one undeniable curve with his cover of the Bee Gees' ""To Love Somebody""-- thirds dropped and Robert Smith on backup vox to boot. Turns out it's not a straight cover; Corgan personalizes it in a spot. Perhaps underscoring the tension he's had in his own career-- a tension he seems to enjoy talking about-- Corgan doesn't sing, ""And I'm blind, so very blind,"" as scripted, but instead asks himself, ""Am I so blind, blind to believe?"" Woof. For an answer, we might turn back to Corgan's cover of ""Destination (Unknown)"": ""I know I'll leave when it's my time to go/ Till then I carry on with what I know."" The swoons fight the groans.</p></div>"|1810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1810-the-future-embrace/|6.4|Nick Sylvester

The fraying and ultimate disintegration of their creative relationship pushed <i>Dog Man Star</i> to its final gloriously turgid, expansive state, with each musician trying to muscle his best ideas to the front. That album isn't just a collection of a band's recently written songs, it's a sweeping picture of despair and interpersonal meltdown. Post-Butler, Suede distanced themselves from that sound, opting instead to become a sort of gutter party band. The catharsis seemed to sap Butler as well-- his solo records are only a song or two removed from totally mediocre, and aside from ""Yes"" I'd rather not think about his collaboration with David McAlmont.</p>
<p>Ten years later, Suede are dead, Butler's way under the radar and here come the Tears, the official reunion of Anderson &amp; Butler. It's a reunion that's been about as low-key as a reunion between these two could possibly be, given that Suede were once so huge that Virgin Megastores across Britain changed their name to Head Music for a day to mark the release of the band's fourth album. Listening to the results, it seems as though they genuinely enjoy working together again-- when Anderson refers to ""you and me"" on ""Two Creatures"" and talks about running away to warmer weather in Africa, it almost sounds like he's talking to Butler and not some anonymous girlfriend as the guitarist's distinctively dissonant leads snake alongside his vocal.</p>
<p>That amity is perhaps a part of the reason <i>Here Come the Tears</i> doesn't quite measure up to the duo's past together-- the seething tension and bitchy moodiness of their original partnership undeniably made the music better and more intense. The other reason things aren't quite as transcendent this time is the more mundane matter of Brett Anderson-- he's selling his voice to tobacconists on an installment plan and can't do melodrama like he used to. Plus, years of frequently lazy lyric writing with Suede Mk II haven't entirely cleared up. That said, there also are no songs that simply list the ways in which various unrelated people are decadent and none that string together references to gasoline, diesel, alcohol, polythene, and trash in a random sequence.</p>
<p>Removed from the context of their past work (ha!), <i>Here Come the Tears</i> is a good album, one with the respective drum and bass work of Mako Sakamoto and Nathan Fisher grounding sweeping ballads like ""Apollo 13"" and driving the speedier songs solidly so that Butler's guitar is free to roam, jousting with the vocal melodies. Butler is still an impressive guitarist-- his solo on ""Lovers"" is a particular highlight. Other hallmarks of the classic <i>Dog Man Star</i>-era sound that surface here include the wandering, Leslie'd pianos and smearing, slightly antagonistic string arrangements, which are held back for just the right moments.</p>
<p>So color me pleasantly surprised-- I really expected very little from an Anderson/Butler reunion, but they've ably demonstrated that my old-guard Suede fan anxiety was unfounded with catchy, dramatic songs like ""Imperfections"" and ""Lovers"". There's nothing as great as ""New Generation"", ""She's Not Dead"", or ""The 2 of Us"" but there doesn't have to be, either, because the Tears have enough natural dynamism of their own to stand alone.</p></div>"|8295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8295-here-come-the-tears/|7.0|Joe Tangari

Max Wood, the kid behind the mess, started the album when he was 16 years old. His mother had just passed away, leaving him with just one grandparent to call family. And he'd begun to suspect that the attention-deficit computer collage of the music he'd made so far was doing the wrong thing-- leaning on jokes and leaning on irony as a way of avoiding any real emotional statement.</p><p>
    
    And then a few months at his computer give us this: A record where all the mess and all the irony could feasibly break your heart. The only catch is that you might not be able to bear listening to it in the first place. The ""songs"" have a slovenly basement buzz on par with Pavement's first singles and <em>God Ween Satan</em>-- and unlike parts of those, Wood is largely insensitive to the notion of developing things like melodies and song structures. No, he just runs together ticky-tack drum machine beats, sews a noisy mess of synth and sample around them, and then rants-- in a nasal, whiny, geekbrat voice that's guaranteed to send ninety percent of listeners racing for the off button.</p><p>
    
    Better still, how about a geekbrat stuck on irony, self-doubt, and self-consciousness? ""Yeah, I lack confidence,"" he says. ""Popular music contributes little to society,"" he says. ""This is awesome,"" he says, ""this is the best song ever."" Then he closes the album out with several minutes of repeating the same thing: ""I have a point/ I have to live/ I cannot die.""</p><p>
    
    Which is my roundabout way of saying that this stuff has more scary, raw emotion in it than you might imagine, all expressed in the painfully ironic, annoyingly self-conscious manner that scary, raw teenage breakdowns actually take. I asked Wood what artists he thinks this might have a kinship with, and his first response was Daniel Johnston-- a mentally ill singer-songwriter whose songs offer a sometimes uncomfortably direct line into a peculiar life. He could just as easily have pointed to Gary Wilson, another teenage-basement type whose neuroses leap right up from the vinyl.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, <em>Uhhh Sort Of</em> is 30 minutes of a guy withering, lecturing himself, saying ""awesome"" a lot, and baldly hyperventilating about loving his mother-- over joyous, scattershot sample-pop that blurts like Kleenex Girl Wonder gone weird. For most people, it'll get written off as annoying, self-indulgent, and amusical, or maybe just a one-shot novelty, and there's plenty of evidence to support those points of view. For a few people, though, it might win a particular spot in the mind-- as part of a line of teenage confrontations with bad feeling and self-consciousness, brought neatly into the PC age, and damned cathartic about it.

    gets to the decent songs (mostly from <em>Sweet Oblivion or <i>Dust</i>), 
    you'll be hard pressed to care. Because the best song is still ""Nearly 
    Lost You"", and being stuck in the middle of this morass does it no 
    favors-- it sounds just as mundane and turgid and wanky as what

    discern anything of interest from the stand-out tracks, like the 
    mellotron-laden ""Traveler"" or ""E.S.K"", a track that actually sounds

    can't forgive Cameron Crowe for </em><em>Vanilla Sky. Because a retrospective-- even if it only covers one era of the band-- should paint the group 
    in 
    a flattering light, and not just throw paint all over the damn place. 
    Because you don't want to support a system that rewards folks for just 
    hanging around and doing stuff, unless you're really looking forward to 
    the next James Bond flick or a new episode of ""The Simpsons"" or the

One imagines Pete Wiggs and Bob Stanley lounging around hotel bars in tailored suits, discussing real estate and drum programming. One imagines singer Sarah Cracknell lingering over wine at lunch with married friends, snapping up her stylish little pocketbook: ""Drat, they'll be expecting me at the studio, we're meant to be arranging woodwinds today."" One imagines parties in London where they cross paths with Rushdie.</p><p>
    
    The image suits them well, and it's a logical destination after the past decade's travels. Was there ever a time when they <em>didn't</em> seem a bit jet-set? It's just that they kicked off seeming young, unmoneyed, thrift-store glamorous, ersatz fabulous: Half of the joy in their earliest records was clocking the ratty seams where their various sonic interests-- dance music breaks and baroque pop, acid synths and sixties swing, Soul II Soul and Bacharach-- collaged into song. If, these days, they seem to have slipped from thrift-store collage into the strictly upscale, it just might be because the joins have vanished from the music. This new album, more than anything they've produced yet, boils all of those impulses into one smooth, seamless thing-- a well-cut party dress that does the same work as those hipster separates.</p><p>
    
    If any single word describes the results, it's ""quaint""-- deliberately quaint, and as charmingly quaint as the album's cover. <em>Tales from Turnpike House</em> is a concept record verging on a musical score, offering a day-in-the-life cycle about the residents of an outer-London housing estate. This being Saint Etienne, those lives are drawn in the same shades of retro-modernity as the music: Up-to-the-minute references sit side by side with a vibe that's all 1960s kitchen-sink English, brightly-colored and respectably working-class, Corn Flakes and teakettles. Morrissey spent half a career plumbing that vibe for its camp and its seediness, but Saint Etienne have no such intentions. Sun rises on the first track, and by the second, the residents are bustling around their breakfasts, each whistling individual parts of the building's ""Milkbottle Symphony"".</p><p>
    
    Any American who's ever studied introductory French will recognize the mix: Those textbooks are forever full of cute, sophisticated college students, splitting their time between le discotheque, le picnic, and la maison. That same mix extends straight out into the music here. These songs create a space where nylon-stringed guitars and fluffy Free Design vocal harmonies mingle unawkwardly with well-styled house beats and synth swells. At times it sounds like the bucolic soundtrack from some sunny late-60s television documentary; at times it sounds like a dance club for the most well-adjusted people in the universe; and at its best-- say, ""A Good Thing"", or the buoyant, breezy disco of ""Stars Above Us""-- it sounds like both at once.</p><p>
    
    All of which leaves it as the most fully-realized thing-- if not the most exciting one-- the band has released since 1994's <em>Tiger Bay</em>. It's like they've finally managed to make the rustic folk of ""Former Lover"" and the city strut of ""I was Born on Christmas Day"" inhabit the same track.  This development may well make them even more of an ""acquired taste"" for the rock kids; it's a cozy little dream-world of soft, slick signifiers, and their new dives into arranging vocal harmonies give it yet another coat of storybook gloss. Same goes for anyone craving more of the chilly electro vibe that bubbled up on their last full length; this, more than ever, is the postcard baroque. When the composition here falters its way toward dullness, both groups might be justified. But when it's working, it's the hard kids' loss: This set lets the group cater more than ever to the shimmering chart-pop act they've never been afraid to be. Pop from a quainter and more self-consciously picturesque place than they-- or we-- will ever live, but slick, dreamy pop nonetheless.</p><p>
    
    Where we live is important, too, as you may well guess from the concept. The one thing American listeners may never fully get out of Saint Etienne is the sheer wealth of cultural detail packed into their work; asking me to get into it may well be like asking Mongolians to explain Kevin Federline. This album, interestingly, gives you a better chance than ever to tap into it. These songs have characters voicing a ""Green Acres"" duet about whether it's worth moving to the country (""Relocate""), a bossa nova whisper about the fear of street crime (""Side Streets""), and a spoken wrap-up where people text-message around the changing neighborhood: The baker's has turned into a tanning salon, and the pub jukebox has given way to the staff's Red Hot Chili Peppers albums. A bonus EP gets even more provincial/universal, with a selection of ""child-friendly"" pastorals that break free into ultra-quaint storybook geography.</p><p>
    
    The package, then: It's less about flash, less about excitement, and more about being good company-- in the same slowly-charming way that a favorite novel can be. A decent portion of the composition works out to be a long-term treat; even when it falters, it's got enough leafy-green musical vibes to last through the summer months. Calling it their ""best since <em>Tiger Bay</em>"" has the same meaningless vibe as putting the same line on folks like Tom Waits-- but depending on your temperament, there's some chance that it's true.</p></div>"|6976.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6976-tales-from-turnpike-house/|7.8|Nitsuh Abebe

Attending college in New York and fast-tracking toward a bank career, she started DJ'ing a radio show spotlighting local and traditional artists and eventually released two well-received albums for Diesel Only Records (run by her husband Jeremy Tepper). <em>Humming By the Flowered Vine, her third full-length and Matador debut, doesn't stray from that familiar territory: Like its predecessors, it's full of sweetly sung melodies and deceptively simple arrangements of originals and lovingly chosen covers.</em></p><p>
    
    Superficially, Cantrell's songs would sound perfectly at home between Allison Krauss and Norah Jones on any playlist, despite the genre differences between them. That's not a damning observation, though: As with Krauss (but less with Jones), below the placid surface of Cantrell's music runs a current of heartbreak that's all the more potent for being so well hidden. It's a hurt inherited from nearly a century of country music tradition, but Cantrell tints it with the patina of personal experience. In other words, she doesn't need to be innovative when she is so expressive.</p><p>
    
    Produced by JD Foster, <em>Humming By the Flowered Vine is slightly more ambitious and decorous than her first two albums. Cantrell corrals an impressive stable of collaborators, including former Blood Orange Mark Spencer and Tin Hat Trio's Rob Burger. Her touring guitarist Dave Schramm even contributes the relatively baroque original ""And Still"", which features Joey Burns and John Convertino of Calexico. But these personalities are well integrated into a larger sound, and the result is a much richer, more nuanced backdrop for Cantrell's voice, enlivening the swing rhythms of ""What You Said"" and ""Wishful Thinking"" and lending a spare texture to ""Bees"" and ""Khaki &amp; Corduroy"".</em></p><p>
    
    Still, Cantrell remains squarely the focus of the album. Recalling contemporaries such as Krauss and Iris Dement-- as well as forebears like Kitty Wells and Patsy Cline at her most restrained-- she still sounds as down-home and unpretentious as ever, with a sophisticated simplicity that's more Big Apple urbane than Music Row countrypolitan. The lead track, a cover of Emily Spray's ""14th Street"", describes the nervous hope of unrequited love through plainspoken lyrics, but the songs's power comes from the arcing chorus melody and from Cantrell's gentle delivery, which drops into a sing-speak whisper as it expresses her truest desire: ""Maybe one step or two/ Then I'd be walking next to you."" </p><p>
    
    Most of the tracks on <em>Humming By the Flowered Vine similarly nurse a kernel of ache. ""Khaki &amp; Corduroy"" evokes a young Southerner's dislocation in the big city, and the standout ""Bees"" gracefully conveys end-of-life yearning. ""I miss the beach/ I miss the honey/ I miss them humming by the flowered vine,"" Cantrell sings delicately. ""My time is short now/ I feel it coming/ I see you darling in morning light."" Instead of grandstanding for maximum tearjerker drama, Cantrell, accompanied by Ted Reichman's elegant piano, emphasizes the track's quiet wistfulness without sounding precious or slight. This understated approach works against her only occasionally, as on the traditional ""Poor Ellen Smith"". Her voice is entirely too clam to convey the grief and confusion of a wrongly accused man, and the narrative's violence and injustice feel transparent and too close to the surface.</em></p><p>
    
    Finally Cantrell does go back to Nashville: <em>Humming By the Flowered Vine closes with the singer wandering the streets of her hometown on ""Old Downtown"", urged onward by Schramm's frayed guitar. She's struck by the city's complicated and conflicted history-- not Music Row but the monument to WWI hero Sergeant Alvin York. Gradually her civic musings give way to a feeling of personal loss as she realizes that her hometown is no longer her home.</em></p></div>"|1287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1287-humming-by-the-flowered-vine/|7.6|Stephen M.

Try Clouds, Grey Weather, the Feathers, the Lightweights, or the Anti-Gravity League (is that one taken yet?), for instance. Those all capture something in their sound, which is a soft, floating brand of ethereal shoegazer dreampop that hits with the force of a peck on the cheek. Not that this is a bad thing, mind you. Their gentle approach is justified by the fact that their songs are quite memorable, written with a sense of grandeur and astral beauty.</p><p>
     
    There are no sharp edges on the band's debut, self-titled full-length, and any that might have cropped up (the guitars in ""One in Seven"", say) are sanded down by the wet, five-fathom production into rounded objects. Anyway, most of these songs would sound pretty good even without the oceans of reverb, something that's a fairly rare feat in texture-based rock. Complex vocal counterpoint hovers over organ and electric piano on ""New Horizons"" before the restrained drums kick in and gauzy guitars slide in to fill out the sound, and the effect is something akin to the quiet interlude of Yes' ""Close to the Edge"".</p><p>
     
    The programmed beats come out on ""Let's Just See"", and the band syncopates the whole song across the strange rhythm they've cooked up, backward guitars and ribbons of phaser swirling in the wings. Faraway strings add their glow to the super-soft-rock ballad ""Forgiveness"", a pillow of a song that overdoes the lulling roundness, leading to serotonin release and even sleep. The big harmonies that feel too gentle there feel great on ""Come in and out of the Rain"", though, a song with bolder dynamics and stratospheric chorus. The highlight is the opener: ""Home"" begins with a little organ and acoustic guitar supporting a group vocal but moves quickly into a big, dripping cavern where every surface glistens and guitars are keyboards are strings are guitars, all mixing into one shimmery texture.</p><p>
     
    On second thought, the term ""shoegazer,"" which I used earlier, doesn't seem quite right, even though comparisons to bands like Slowdive and 7% Solution certainly hold up. These guys are definitely looking up and finding all the inspiration they need in the vastness above. The lack of gravity is an occasional knock against them, but by and large they make good use of their weightlessness, and <em>Engineers is a solid debut.</em></p></div>"|2929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2929-engineers/|7.2|Joe Tangari

Citykid Ellen Allien's through with fooling (<i>Stadtkind</i>), through with mindblowing, genre-defiant, vox-happy mass appeal 
    (<i>Berlinette</i>). Her new one's ""I'm making <i>real</i> techno now"" approach comes through loud/clear: no glitch, no ruse of song, straight-up bangers off quaint analog, and the back to mine instant cred of her rare ARP 2600 purchase. So apparently Allien's serious now-- at the very least serious about seeming serious.</p><p>
    
    The functional grind is brutal at first. Round one, Allien only goes 
    down good when she sticks to trashscapes: ""Cloudy City"" cops bellhead drums 
    and fries them 8-bit, a disorienting groove that takes a minute for the 
    head and arse not to look the same. ""She Is With Me"", same thing, though much prettier; this time the glitch is less programmatic--
    the deep bass keychain sound FX synths get lost in echo, and 
    accumulate, and collide.</p><p>
    
    When <i>Thrills</i> finally makes sense-- it's 
    a genre record, unconcerned with newness and interested primarily in 
    dropping
    tight loops with well-tempered size/movement gestures-- those songs we 
    liked
    first stick out sore. They do, to my ear, sound less serious, next to
    Allien's Anthems. ""Come"", that mature leadoff track ready to explode 
    but
    Victorian enough not to, never drops a snare. 
    On
    the backend, ""Magma"" insists on minimal clicks and hums, the volume 
    knob
    upped and downed with the guise of build-- surely to land itself on
    <i>Fabriclive 30 between some Melchior throwback and a Senor 
    Coconut
    track, remixed by Crazy Remixer Dude Nobody Actually Cares About. I 
    guess
    there's merit there, but I'm not smiling; not dancing either.</i></p><p>
    
    Am I bummed Allien's resigned herself to making just another serious 
    techno
    record with but one memorable track? Am I bummed that said memorable 
    track
    (""The Brain Is Lost"") is only memorable because it sounds like Mu's 
    ""Tiger
    Bastard"" and Output electro-goth shit in general? Do I think the 
    fabulously
    titled ""Ghost Train"", which I would respect on name alone, is an 
    excellent
    example of Allien accidentally insisting her half-finished tracks are, 
    in
    fact, stubborn loops that I should approve of on grounds of build and
    confidence, instead of bemoaning their monochromaticism and lack of
    ambition? Why is ""Naked Rain"" not as cheeky as it should be?</p><p>
    
    Not that all simple things need to be more complex, nor do heavy things 
    need
    better larfs, but yeah: I do miss Allien's playfulness. What I get from
    <i>Thrills</i> is not a natural outgrowth but a conscious break from 
    her own
    musical trajectory-- not to mention Bpitch in general, however much 
    either
    has been dictated by other musicians (Apparat, Smash TV). She's onto 
    some
    good shit here, but there's too much learning on the job.</p></div>"|414.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/414-thrills/|7.0|Nick Sylvester

    and if you're lazy you can eat the peel. In 1993, Blur recorded a
    B-side (later a U.S. bonus track) called ""Peach"", in which Damon
    Albarn murmurs, ""Chemical eats/ Best part of the peach."" A year
    later, as Allen Clapp &amp; His Orchestra, Orange Peels bandleader Allen
    Clapp recorded a lo-fi pop song called ""Why Sting Is Such an Idiot"".
    But in 2005, on his third album with the Orange Peels, the Clapp-- as
    he's called by uncreative schoolchildren, drunken friends, and smarmy
    critics-- has long since traded his four-track for ProTools. His Peels
    lie, peeling, unappealingly, in the synthetic sun, studio chemicals
    devouring their best parts like the 90-lb. Kappa who always wins the
    burger-eating contest, their infinite MORdom and bafflingly childish
    lyrics occasionally out-idioting a guy too dumb just to pay Roxanne
    already and get down to tantric biznass.</p><p>
    OK, OK, anyone familiar with music HIStory (Jacko not guilty shocka!
    Jacko not pertinent double-shocka!) knows that what's <em>really</em>
    punk/indie/rawk is to defy the underground's inevitable strictures.
    The Minutemen covered Creedence, Hüsker Dü's bassist had a handlebar
    mustache, and Billy Corgan still won't shut up about how much he loves
    Black Sabbath. So I guess that makes <em>Circling the Sun</em> the
    indiest of indie-pop records, subverting the vague genre's
    idiosyncrasies with adult-contemporary production values. I say REO,
    you say Speedwagon!</p><p>
    Look, you haven't heard left-coast luminaries like the Beach Boys or
    the Byrds until you've heard their sounds recontextualized as
    hyper-Mellotronned Disney-ballad rejects. ""Kokomo"" was nothing. On ""So
    Right""-- a re-recording of a stripped-down 2002 solo version-- the
    Clapper takes full advantage of his studio time to over-emote a
    dandyish vocal vibrato worthy of Dream Theater from 1997's soft-prog
    mostly-dud <em>Fallling Into Infinity</em>. Even the panning echo
    effects halfway through ""I Don't Wanna Shine"" (think fellow fruit band
    Lemon Pipers) sound too mall-ready to blow minds. The dude on Trio's
    mullet special who thinks Nirvana killed music? He likes this album.
    Do you own the Zombies' lethally schlocked 2004 reunion album? Your
    granddaughter probably gave you this for Father's Day.</p><p>
    Still, like fellow indie-pop disappointments Aberfeldy, the Orange
    Peels' worst sin is that they speak English. The latest in Clapp's
    panoply of weather songs broach the topic as banally as Water Cooler
    Guy did this afternoon (i.e., without Lucksmithian ingenuity). The
    rhymes remain a study in amateurishness: ""Everyone was there/ There
    was something in the"" ... air! ""Everything seems wrong/ I put on the
    rain"" ... song! ""And listen to it every night/ Just to try to
    convince myself that it was all"" ... right!</p><p>
    Despite the bright, gorgeous melodies underlying the record, only
    ""What's It's Like (Mary Jo)"" comes close to making up for the
    lacquered production and lyrical excruciation. With a shuffling beat,
    the song displays the album's least-overthought arrangement and simple
    lyrics that actually work, plus the record's best rhyme (""Doris
    Day""/""naivete""). Clapp-ing ensues. Then the indie pop sun retreats
    behind more digital clouds. Christ, Sting released ""Fields of Gold"" in
    1993! Like peaches, Orange Peels are sometimes the pits.</p></div>"|6020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6020-circling-the-sun/|3.3|Marc Hogan

Now he sings with his eyes closed-- earnest and calm, face pressed to the microphone, hair plastered to his forehead: the two-disc </em><em>In Your Honor is Grohl at his most pensive, purposefully distanced from his all-American prankster persona, attempting to build a legacy that extends beyond the shadows of Nirvana and Kurt Cobain, past well-publicized star-turns in other people's bands. </em><em>In Your Honor is Dave Grohl claiming ground.</em></p><p>
    
    Sadly, the record suffers from that largeness-- reportedly recorded in a warehouse, its double disc conceit (one half is hard rock, the other acoustic) is heavy handed, the segregation too deliberate. Grohl's ""metal"" voice periodically strains, like he's concentrating too hard on forefronting his emotional intensity; likewise, the softer tracks can sound stifled, like their proprietor is holding something back, curbing his urges for the sake of classification.</p><p>
    
    Disc One features loads of thundering guitars and manic drum breakdowns, classic Foo structures (brash verse, anthemic chorus) and aggressively contemplative lyrics.  Single ""Best of You"" muses furiously about the frailty of the human heart, asking clunky questions (""Were you born to resist, or be abused?/ Is someone getting the best of you?""), Grohl's chest-screams barely seeping through his bandmates' soupy guitars. The song fades out where it should climax, bleeding into ""DOA"", a twisty, death-obsessed cut (""It's a shame we have to disappear/ No one's getting out of here/ Alive"") with docile vocals (that almost sound as if they were snatched from another song.) Meanwhile, the 70s rock-infused ""Resolve"", a dynamic call for tenacity, is memorable-- but still weirdly reminiscent of nearly every Foo Fighters single ever shot to radio. </p><p>
    
    The big problem is that the Foo Fighters are telling the exact same story, over and over: heavy guitars, Grohl's bitter, self-directed hollers, loud drums, catchy choruses. At their best, the Foo Fighters are muscular and unrelenting, pushing in all the right spots-- but Disc One still confirms an undeniable stasis. Ten years have passed, and the band isn't evolving: This is where <em>In Your Honor's big curveball-- the acoustic second disc-- attempts to make up for all the retreads.</em></p><p>
    
    It succeeds, to an extent. The bossanova-tinged ""Virginia Moon"" (which features guest vocals from Starbucks' own Norah Jones) proffers brushed cymbals, flamenco guitar, and tinkling piano bits-- it sounds more like a classic Norah Jones track than anything the Foos have ever recorded, but the band's sudden break in character is also intriguing: With its jazzy, coffee-table lyrics (""Sweetest invitation/ Breaking the day in two/ Feeling like I do/ Virginia moon, I wait for you tonight""), ""Virginia Moon"" allows Grohl to croon gently into the night sky, singing lullabies to an army of dudes driving home from their girlfriend's houses in their Honda Accords. Barely breaking a whisper, Jones and Grohl's respective vocals blend effortlessly; surprisingly, it's Jones who adds a bit of grit to the track, her grainy murmurs sneaking texture into Grohl's squeaky-clean pipes. </p><p>
    
    The docile ""Miracle"" features a cameo by Led Zeppelin's own John Paul Jones, although its gentle piano and sweet acoustic strums aren't terribly suggestive of sharp Zep bluster. ""Cold Day in the Sun"" sees drummer Taylor Hawkins assuming lead vocals, steering the Foo Fighters dangerously close to adult contemporary mush; ""Friend of a Friend"", a Nirvana-era Grohl original (supposedly written about his former bandmates) is eerily quiet, just strums and voice, Grohl's vocals controlled and determined, pushing his way through. That unwavering restraint provides one of the most emotionally honest moments on <em>In Your Honor-- listen close, and you can almost hear Grohl's face going white.</em></p><p>
<em>In Your Honor, like most Foo Fighters records, is sterile and controlled; there is never any threat of dissolution. While Grohl's musicianship and charisma are certainly a credit to any project he participates in, he still lacks the volatility typically inherent to life-shaking art. Nirvana felt wobbly, fragile, and fleeting, Queens of the Stone Age pound deranged, Probot are full-on bananas: The Foo Fighters are strong, neat, and clean. So we wonder: Can a steady, hard-working everydude from northern Virginia make transcendent art? Sure. Does Dave Grohl? Sometimes.</em></p></div>"|3149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3149-in-your-honor/|6.8|Amanda Petrusich

    production, which comes courtesy of Madlib, Oh No, J Dilla, and mega-watt stunner
    Just Blaze, moonlighting from his world-renowned heat-rocketeer dayjob
    to throw a slick stone of his own. Handling 10 of the album's 15
    beats, the prolific Madlib takes the reigns and tosses
    off a steady stream of (relatively) clear-headed soul-bubble beats
    that offer welcome respite from his other more esoteric, hit-or-miss
    avant-personas. Meanwhile, the California MC unwittingly sabotages himself while
    attempting a hard-to-handle blend of Kweli-esque wordy consciousness
    and mainstream boast-a-licious chest-huffing but doesn't have the
    wisdom or swagger to pull off either convincingly.</p><p>
    
    ""What U In It For?"" serves as a microcosm for the disc's
    failings. Madlib
    brother Oh No's pop-lock beat provides a head nod by way of its
    slithering synth bass playing off a high-end guitar flick and panning
    digital alarm, but MED tries to stuff too
    many syllables into the verses, dragging down the syncopated rhythm.
    It's no coincidence the hottest part of the track is the minute-long
    instrumental outro. Clearly lost when it comes to hooks (the record's
    best choruses are decidedly MED-less), the rapper answers the track's
    titular question with a lame refrain featuring sleepwalking lines like,
    ""The beats and the rhymes, streets and the grind, I hustle for mines.""</p><p>
    
    MED nearly matches his high-caliber music from time to time. Singer
    Noelle recreates ""Special""'s original Erykah Badu-sampling hook and
    her flighty voice adds a lightness that justly contrasts her partner's
    dense lyricism. ""We have to do it big or like a short fuse we soon to
    detonate and blow up for raising the stakes,"" he theorizes, deftly
    juggling the ideas of under and over ground rap as perky piano
    chords drive the melody while a slew of chimes and undulating hums go
    lengths to uphold Madlib's instant-vintage reputation. Sounds of bongs
    being hit and tokers coughing can't ruin ""Never Give U Up"", an
    effervescent horn-laden ode to marijuana. (Yes, Madlib's behind this
    one too.) The hook's ba-do-be scat sample yields Push's most natural
    high, a feel-good anthem for hash-hounds worldwide.</p><p>
    
    The more commercial-ready fare is intriguing considering Stones
    Throw's unique place in the hip-hop universe, but it ultimately
    disappoints. Just Blaze joint ""Get Back"" is an
    uncharacteristically svelte exercise in minimalism, with swooning
    strings and funky bongos subtly boosting the bump. But the producer so
    overshadows his MC, he's even awkwardly referenced in the track's
    chorus (""Just Blaze where you at?"").</p><p>
    
    For an album that could desperately use more lightweight guest shots
    for simple variety's sake, <em>Push is largely devoid of such fresh air.
    But it's A Tribe Called Quest and Fugees producer and part-time MC
    Diamond D's playful verse on the hyped-up ""Pressure"" that crystallizes
    Push's failed potential. The hip-hop vet growls semi-corny lines like,
    ""And I'm grindin' so you won't see me often/ I'm tryin' to make 6
    million like Stevie Austin,"" but, unlike MED, his goofy, nonchalant
    style sells the lines and, for a few seconds, you get an impression of
    what this album full of casually spectacular beats would sound like
    fronted by an MC who could do them justice.</em></p></div>"|5652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5652-push-comes-to-shove/|6.7|Ryan Dombal

    almost universally negative connotations, instrumental post-rockers
    lead a pretty thankless existence. Their music is slow, humorless, and
    uneventful. Looking for gimmicks? Try elsewhere. Though their live
    performances can be Voice-of-God loud, recorded sound has a
    disappointing, mellowing effect on bands like Explosions in the Sky,
    Mogwai, City of Caterpillar, and ambient-metal label Neurot
    interlopers Red Sparowes. Success stories are few. When Explosions in
    the Sky scored a big-budget Hollywood film, <i>Friday Night Lights, it
    was a sort of backhanded compliment: The band, who'd theretofore
    propagated unwieldily large instrumentals, were sought after to make
    cool background noise.</i></p><p>
    So how is a band to survive making such underappreciated, often
    derided, music? One way is to do what Red Sparowes do, which is infuse
    their lumbering instrumentals with idiosyncratic guitar licks that
    poach from forbidden genres. You know, those emphasizing concision,
    catchiness, and ease of digestion.</p><p>
<em>At the Soundless Dawn</em> isn't exactly pop. In fact, the album is all
    instrumental post-rock in its viscera, from the swollen, hour-plus
    runtime (avg. song = nine minutes) to the ponderous doses of reverb.
    But de-bone these meaty cuts and you'll find some unexpected
    stylizing. Froghopping discreetly from soggy new wave to ecclesiastic
    country twang, Red Sparowes find a way to the beat tedium inherent to
    their genus-- then ride it for so long that...are you paying
    attention?</p><p>
    ""Mechanical Sounds Cascaded Through the City Walls and Everyone
    Reveled in Their Ignorance"" tops 11 minutes but rocks the silo for
    a too-brief spell, bending and sliding like a syrup-sipping Ry Cooder.
    But there's still those other 10 minutes to account for, and the
    build-up/comedown are the means that don't justify the ends.
    Somewhat-title track ""The Soundless Dawn Came Alive as Cities Began to
    Mark the Horizon"" sobs just fine without vocals, thanks, awaiting its
    emo (not emo) troubadour. (He never shows.) ""A Brief Moment of Clarity
    Before the Deafening Hum, But it Was Too Late"" flirts with awesome
    Unwound sewer grooves, but it's too good-natured to do any damage,
    dressing its sludgy privates in a Big Distorted Chorus.</p><p>
    Red Sparowes treat their genre like a menial internship: It's entre
    to bigger, better things, right? Or maybe they really are passionate
    about instrumental post-rock. Beats filing, I guess. But at these
    lugubrious tempos-- and this album's interminable length-- listening
    is a lot like busy work: redundant and largely unrewarding.</p></div>"|6945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6945-at-the-soundless-dawn/|5.9|Sam Ubl

Josh Garza's military timing contrasts dramatically with Brandon Curtis's rumbling guitar and Ben Curtis's stoner keyboard atmospherics and coded-message lyrics create a strange and insistent urgency that's still fresh more than a year later. ""The Road Leads Where It's Led"" is easily the best song on its namesake EP, which collects one other original and four covers.</p><p>
    
    The selling point for many listeners will most likely be the covers of Van Morrison, Barrett Strong (well, Bradford and Gordy), and Bob Dylan. Morrison's ""Astral Weeks"" starts promisingly enough, with a pendulum rhythm arcing between guitar and keyboards and Brandon Curtis delivering Morrison's mystical lyrics. Garza's drums add heft to the sound, and towards the end the instruments start reverberating trippily, as if they've actually gone astral. But the problem with ""Astral Weeks"" is the same problem that's more pronounced on ""Money (That's What I Want)"" and ""Girl From North Country"": The Secret Machines seem so restricted by the lyrical structures of these songs that the only deviations they can make from the originals are slowing the tempo and adding more tedious dynamics.</p><p>
    
    ""Money"" and ""Girl from the North Country"" are both very slow and very long...but that's about it. They nearly triple the running times of their respective originals, but there's not much to them besides some foggy psychedelica to justify such lengths. And considering ""Money"" has historically had little compunction about its greediness, the Secret Machines could have turned the song into a biting and topical commentary on institutional avarice that would have fit perfectly on the conspiratorial <i>Now Here Is Nowhere. But instead, there seems to be little meaning to the song beyond its stunt value.</i></p><p>
    
    The Machines' version of Dylan's ""Girl from the North Country"" begins with as much promise as ""Astral Weeks"": a laser-light-show synth pierces the ambience before giving way to quiet pulses of sound that give the song its sense of gloomy foreboding. Later, an acoustic guitar plays so faintly it sounds like a 40-year-old echo of Dylan's. The song gently breaks as if building toward something big and majestic, but its structure is so closely and reverently tied to Dylan's lyrical progressions that the Machines cannot deviate from his song structure. It's entirely constructed around Ben Curtis's vocals, and the other instruments-- guitar and drums-- are relegated to supporting roles, whereas on <em>Now Here Is Nowhere the trio traded off melodic lines among instruments for optimum drama. The band maintains a palpable tension for nine minutes, but it all comes to nothing-- the fog never lifts, the song remains shapeless.</em></p><p>
    
    For a band that gets so many dogged comparisons to Pink Floyd, these are perhaps admirable, even necessary attempts to expose the breadth of their influences. But ultimately, these somewhat obvious choices don't really reflect much on the Machines' sonic palette. In fact, the original track ""Better Bring Your Friends"" and, to a lesser extent, their cover of Harmonia's ""De Luxe (Immer Weider)"" are the only two tracks on the EP that reveal new facets of the band. The EP's most obscure cover is also its most concise (shorter than the original) and in some ways its most faithful: Without playing note for note, ""De Luxe"" re-creates the original's rigid tempo, regimented rhythms, Doppler momentum, and studied repetition and suggests that the Machines have deeply absorbed Krautrock elements into their own sound, even if they don't refashion those elements into anything new on this cover.</p><p>
    
    More fun and less academic, the Machines original ""Better Bring Your Friends"" is the true surprise here. It draws on their Texas influences to create an upbeat vibe that would go over well at Willie Nelson's Fourth of July picnic. Even more crucially, there is no hint of awkwardness or hesitation: all of the sonic elements-- Garza's hoedown drumbeat, Ben Curtis's loose vocals and propulsive piano-- blend together fluidly and dramatically. If some of these songs are wrong turns, ""Better Bring You Friends"" gets them back on the road <em>Now Here Is Nowhere started them along.</em></p></div>"|7058.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7058-the-road-leads-where-its-led-ep/|5.8|Stephen M.

While the members of Liverpool upstarts the Dead 60s clearly sleep with a copy of <em>London Calling under their pillows, their music propagates the libertine Franz Ferdinandian mantra ""we just wanna make girls dance."" Not to say that a dearth of politics in music is necessarily damning, but without that sneer directed towards the powers-that-be, the Dead 60s take on reactionary bands like the Clash and Gang of Four mires in half-baked ska and paradoxically insouciant punk rock. In short, the Dead 60s may be as ill-equipped for the punk revival pantheon as they are for a spot on CNN's ""Crossfire"".</em></p><p>
    
    Case in point, these guys are already rubbing elbows on tour with new wave charlatans the Killers and the Bravery. I won't arraign by association though, especially since first Dead 60s single, ""Riot Radio"", does itself in, reeking of stale minor chord progressions and the same hi-hat happy drumming that's sanctified dancing for klutzy white dudes since ""Somebody Told Me"". Yes, this song and others on the album have ""movement"" and ""energy"" and any other shibboleth your local DJ will spout out, but there's a troubling fear to deviate too far from the standardized ""punk"" sound.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps as a reaction to their self-imposed musical limitations, the Dead 60s rebel by championing drinking, womanizing and nearly any other possible form of debauchery. Single ""Loaded Gun"" lusts for a femme fatal who's ""got a loaded gun pointed at me,"" but, while its art-funk virility shines as the album's standout, frontman Matt McManamon's uninspired lounge vocals fail to effectively play off the song's martini-cool 007 guitar riffs. Alcohol anthem ""Horizontal"" laments modern day vicissitudes with radio-friendly nihilism, climaxing with the drab line ""I wanna be horizontal."" McManamon's sour countenance gets downright comical on closer ""You're Not The Law"", where McManamon's petulant reggae wail flawlessly mimics Sublime's Brad Nowell.</p><p>
    
    Despite the pea-brained lyrics and predictable songwriting, the Dead 60s at least sincerely appreciate their influences, as opposed to most revivalist poseurs who often appear to hate the bands they imitate. After all, the first thirty seconds of the album clearly establish the band's purpose-- to have a good time playacting as their rock idols. Even their name suggests an immutable focus on the past, and this self-titled debut certainly isn't bequeathing anything new to posterity. Hey, at least they're honest.</p></div>"|2614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2614-the-dead-60s/|5.8|Adam Moerder

Full-on body music's great, sure, but so is porno, and with that shit I'd much rather wax new flesh than drag my stylus off the same old 10-second loop. Same time, Intelligent Body Music's as much a nightmare as Intelligent Anal, both a prefab excuse for pleasure-lack. So we're stuck in this immediacy=better rut, when really the best stuff cross-genre-- cross-platform, cross-media-- has instant funk, but with enough tricks for prolonged appeal.</p><p>  Liking <em>We Are Monster</em> is easy. Isolée aren't bangers but they groove hard enough; melodies are pretty but most times we have to look for them (no lead vox or riff jihad per se). Tracks aren't afraid to be songs (""Face B""), and songs aren't afraid to be tracks (""Jelly Baby / Fish""). Everything's pleasant in other words, non-threatening like the cutesy-est Morr Music lullaby, but physical enough that you could get away with some great normal-person dancing. There are guitar sounds on a few tracks too, if that's important (""Today"" sounds like ""Do You Realize?""), and traceable horizontal A--&gt;B trajectory in songs with actual movements and quantifiable progress. No need for all the ""it's about size! it's about expansion!"" apologies people make for their favorite loops.</p><p>  As for loving this record-- letting it problematize itself with spins and learning to let it offend-- well, <em>We Are Monster</em> has the depth if you have the time. Yep, here's a fun record that's a work-for-it, in-the-details record, too. Behind the choked-vocals groove of, say, ""Enrico"" are countless micro-surprises (check how the kicks break down differently each turnaround, or how the downbeat finally drops deceptively mid-bar instead of on the loop's head), structured flips with chess-like anticipation (the guitar-like scratches function percussively at first, their color stuck in overtones until the song needs them in full), and avalanching momentum not from Isolée stuffing ideas half-baked, but from letting the seeds of lines grow, branch out, and tangle. Not sure we can talk of ""Golden Age IDM"" or even ""Golden Age Techno"" yet, but something like the Copeland-does-<em>Glam</em> gem ""Schrapnell"" seems so effortless, breathes so carefree, years from now crits might accuse it of sounding timeless-- maybe even of being so.</p><p>  The rest of the tracks have their own self-revealing logic, obeying the beat but never in dependency to it. Honestly, you could drop the drum sounds off ""Madchen mit Hase"" and the song would still kill a floor, the rhythms of its composite parts boasting good spine, serving the melody before decorating the dancefloor. No gesture's incidental; the simplest blip plays for both a greater purpose and its own passing punchline. Even the second-trackiest number, ""Do Re Mi"", fronts a perplexing guitar jingle so it can alley-oop with drones of the same progression and a goofy italo-disco melody of 180-degree mood change, then the polar-opposite timbre. These songs are well-poised and well-developed and terrifyingly autonomous-- so much so I'm afraid they're no longer Isolée's anymore. On that note: Yeah, while I wish <em>We Are Monster</em> was an Album w/Overarching Concerns and Worldview, not just a Bunch Of Sweet Similar-Sounding Stand-Alone Tracks, I'm also convinced that in fact, a worldview is there, and probably an exciting one at that. I just haven't cracked one yet-- or just won't be able to.</p><p> </p></div>"|4164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4164-we-are-monster/|8.4|Nick Sylvester

""Fire Fire"", for instance, is transcendent, epic, gorgeous dance music, a dizzy, sticky helium chorus over a bleepy soca synth line and disco-call whistles, so fast that it seems ready to spin out of control at any second.</p><p>
    
    So it goes on <em>Unknown Language, the group's second LP. From the urgent clarion-call staccato keyboards of ""Hey Ladies"" to the ethereal choir-synths and impossibly heavy drum hits of ""No Way Jose"" to the handclappy playground Coolie Dance chanting of the title track, nearly every track on the LP is a glittering and giddy. The production has an omnivorous reach, squeezing in frisky, heavy Latin piano and reggaeton drums on ""She Hotter"" and howling, wordless Middle-Eastern chanting on ""Neck Breakers"". And the members' voices, ranging from the throaty, gravelly Bounty Killer-esque growl of Flexx to the creamy, squeaky high croon of Bay-C, weave into a fluid, seamless harmonic tapestry on breathtaking chorus after breathtaking chorus. These songs, almost without exception, are about girls and partying, but party music is rarely this urgently, transcendently joyous.</em></p><p>
    
    When cognitive dissonance does raise its head, it's on ""Wah Gwan"", a track that with a greasy, squelchy Booker T organ and a clickety-clack drum pattern, seems to be a homeland-pride anthem at first but turns out to be a lament about Jamaica's epidemic violence: ""Me no like wah gwan/ Too much innocents are dead; wah gwan?"" And the floating, angelic ""Footprints"", which rests on acoustic guitars and one of the old-school drop beats currently popular in Jamaica, is something like T.O.K.'s version of TLC's ""Waterfalls"", a sad, simple elegy for kids killed by random violence and rendered homeless by abject poverty in a poor, dangerous country. If the party needs to slow down for a minute, it needs to slow down for a track like this.</p></div>"|8280.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8280-unknown-language/|8.1|Tom Breihan

    if you count producer Warn Defever of His Name is Alive, who chips in some
    wah guitar). Led by multi-instrumentalist Elliot Bergman, Nomo play a
    heavy, largely faithful descendant of Fela Kuti &amp; Tony Allen's classic
    Afrobeat sound that leans more toward the jazz side of the style than the funk
    side, with the occasional blast of distorted guitar or flourish from a flute.</p><p>
    
    Defever's horn sound is deliciously crunchy and deep, with special emphasis on Dan Bennett's blazing baritone sax, but the production leaves a lot of air between those arrangements and the
    rhythm section, which consists of multiple guitars, bass, two drummers, and
    assorted percussionists. All those people make for quite a solid wall of sound,
    but the music is surprisingly nuanced, with the band able to pull back and
    just let the Rhodes piano blanket the groove with pillowy chords or allow a
    solo to breathe. Most of the band members get their shot in the spotlight
    at some point on the record, and they all shine, though some more brightly
    than others. Bennett in particular cuts loose on ""Busy"", wrenching a
    twisting, growling solo from his horn.</p><p>
    
    Bergman's horn themes provide ample jumping-off points for his band mates' improvisations, and they carry the mostly instrumental album nicely, offering a lot of ear-grabbing moments to balance the solos and the
    occasional jammy tangent. The only vocal original on the album, ""Moving in Circles"", features one of Nomo's heaviest, nastiest horn charts and then asks poor bassist Jamie Register to compete with it, a task I don't envy. She does well by it, though, opting for a smoothly soulful delivery
    that acts as a sort of counterpoint to the thundering horns. She also does a great job on the band's sped-up cover of Segun Bucknor's awesome, funky Afro-soul song ""La La La"".</p><p>
    
    It's only one album, but this record places Nomo rather firmly near the head of an emerging pack of Afrobeat revival bands, led by New York City's Antibalas along with a few other established acts like Akoya and Kokolo. It's a good bet that anyone who digs Ted Sirota's Soul Rebels will love this, given the emphasis on jazz, and naturally, there's the affinity with Fela, so Afrobeat and Afro-jazz afficionados are encouraged to give a listen. Anyone else who just wants to dance can come along, too.</p></div>"|5915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5915-nomo/|7.8|Joe Tangari

If emo is commonly defined as ""we
    know it when we hear it,"" maybe post-hardcore is ""we know it when we
    can't hear anything after hearing it."" But that's too easy; lots of
    music is loud. Maybe post-hardcore is what happens when people who are
    into hooks and melodies get into heavier styles like punk, metal, and
    hardcore. Post-hardcore kids listen to classic Metallica and hear the
    melody beneath the mayhem, the pop in the apoplexy. They listen to emo
    and imagine what those wobbly arpeggios would sound like with some
    real balls in the dynamic shifts, some buffness in the chordage.</p><p>
    
    You can hear some latter-day Wire in Bear Vs. Shark's linear, deeply
    textured riffs; there's some early Mission of Burma in their
    pronounced loud/soft dynamics and fist-pumping rhythmic maneuvers. But
    beneath <em>Terrorhawk</em>'s ripped chords, frantic tempos and
    dudefaced vocals, there's a dewy-eyed indie rock record whimpering to
    be let out. Not that letting it out would've been advisable-- as it
    stands, the raw fury and insane energy level of the album stampedes
    right over the brain and booms down the spine.</p><p>
    
    Deeper than it initially sounds, <em>Terrorhawk</em> will send you
    scrambling for a few points of reference before you zero in on the
    right one. Trail of Dead? Not quite. Constantines? Closer...Soon it
    starts making sense how the ballads sit comfortably with the
    screamers, the uninflected melodic vocals with the shredded-larynx
    ones, the brainy leads with the knuckle-dragging chords: This is the
    spiritual heir to Cursive's <em>Domestica</em>, an indie-hardcore record
    that's interested in locating the violence inherent in the lullaby and
    the euphony in the scorched-earth anthem. </p><p>
<em>Terrorhawk</em> starts off totally beefcake with ""Catamaran"".
    Galloping, muted chords with a little hitch for texture leap out
    first, but there are some delicate harmonics chiming behind them. The
    vocals and drums fall into step for a moment, but it's like they just
    can't friggin' wait to let loose, and soon the song's careening like
    it was launched from a catapult. ""5, 6 Kids"" changes the tone right
    away-- with a tortured lead and ragged vocals, it's like an iron maul
    dragging on an iron floor, heavy and sparking. And ""Baraga Embankment""
    is an honest-to-God piano ballad that, even after the distorted chords
    kick in, has already tipped Bear Vs. Shark's indie-rocking hand. I'll
    be straight with you, I'm not usually into anything deemed
    post-hardcore. But <em>Terrorhawk</em> grabbed me by the short hairs
    from the first track, and hasn't let go since.</p></div>"|1163.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1163-terrorhawk/|7.7|Brian Howe

    sludge metal compilation. In the early 90s, he was a member of drone
    metal pioneers Earth, a band he left to join the Melvins. In more
    recent times he's recorded with Sunn 0))), collaborated with ex-members of Karp
    in the Whip, and toured with High on Fire. Thrones is his
    solo project in the truest sense of the
    term: For most recordings, Preston is the only performer. <em>Day
    Late, Dollar Short</em> collects 19 rare tracks stretching from
    1994 through 2001; many of these songs originally appeared on 7""'s and
    comps, while several have never been released.</p><p>
    With few exceptions, the tracks on <em>Day Late, Dollar Short</em>
    fall into two categories. Behind door number one is the bulk of the
    material, and it's like the sonic equivalent of watching a building
    collapse in slow motion. The bass is down-tuned and distorted almost
    beyond comprehension, the slow, disjointed beat is provided by a drum
    machine, and Preston's vocals are mumbled, warped, and warbled. Door
    number two hides the even more bizarre: vaudeville-esque organ drones
    with show-tune like vocal melodies, warped piano tinkerings, and
    Theremin-inspired, sci-fi guitar lines.</p><p>
    The album's opener, 1994's ""The Suckling"", is a solid introduction. The bass stretches from note to note,
    shifting constantly but rarely locating a melody. Conversely, ""Senex"", also from 1994, is built
    almost entirely around two rapidly repeating bass notes. There is no
    chorus, and the mumbled vocals are indecipherable. But to focus only on elements such as melody, chorus, verse, tune, and beat is to miss the point entirely; like many of Preston's projects, Thrones pursue sonic
    texture rather than a catchy hook. The challenging nature of the
    music is that the texture is almost entirely bass guitar. Even when the tempo increases, the emphasis remains on
    pummeling bass lines and acid-trip vocals. Unfortunately, therein lies the problem. Relying so heavily on one
    instrument means these songs often lack individuality. The tempo
    might change, but by the end of the disc it's hard
    to avoid feeling like you've listened to the same song five or six
    times.</p><p>
    The non-bass-centric tracks come across as mostly throwaways. It's
    difficult to imagine anyone getting excited and cranking the volume up on ""Silvery Colorado"", a traditional tune once
    recorded by the Carter Family. Needless to say, the version here
    isn't exactly traditional. And although the gloomy ""Epicus Doomicus
    Bumpitus"" works as some sort of funeral march from the church of the
    damned, its follow up, ""Piano Handjob"", sounds, well, about like its
    title. But these tracks and others break up the monotony of bass-on-bass love, giving the listener a
    brief respite from having his ears violated.</p><p>
    The few tracks that break the mold are the collection's shining
    moments. Three covers stand out-- Ultravox's ""Young Savage"",
    Blue Öyster Cult's ""Black Blade"", and the Who's ""A Quick One, While He's Away"". ""Young
    Savage"" is a driving post-punk anthem, complete with live percussion
    provided by Spinanes and Built to Spill drummer Scott Plouf. ""Black
    Blade"" is a faithful rendition of the original, with the closest
    thing to singing this album can claim. Most interesting, however, is
    ""A Quick One"", which the liner notes explain was recorded for what
    was meant to be a split 7"" with Fast Forward, Sinking Body, and the
    Catholic Church, where each band recorded a section of the song.
    Beginning with vocal harmonies courtesy of a little pitch shifting,
    then continuing with a synth lead and robotic vocals, the section
    covered by Thrones is a fun departure from the doom and gloom found
    elsewhere on the disc.</p></div>"|8045.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8045-day-late-dollar-short/|5.8|Cory D. Byrom

It's not difficult to hear how Eno's ideas find their way into     whatever he's working on, but when you're debating what to play it's     always either ""I'm in the mood for vocal Eno"" or ""I'm in the mood for     ambient Eno."" The twin box sets he released in the early 90s were split     along the same line, so obviously the man himself draws a similar     distinction.</p>
<p>Though he's steadily produced instrumental music over the past 20 years,     Eno's only pop release during this time has been the 1990 collaboration     with John Cale, <i>Wrong Way Up</i>. Good album, and it was particularly fun to     hear him apply to his own music all the production tricks (bass guitar     high in the mix, doubled, tripled, and quadrupled vocals, etc.) he'd been     using with other bands over the previous decade. Now, 15 years and a     clutch of instrumental albums later, Eno returns to songs with <i>Another     Day on Earth.</i> The record starts beautifully with ""This"", a mantra-like melody with a     vaguely West African rhythm that sounds very much along the lines of <i> </i><i>Wrong Way Up</i>'s ""Spinning Away"". It's an ideal first song-- catchy,     relaxed, and expansive-- with Eno in fine voice and multi-tracked to the     point where it seems almost rude not to sing along. It's not a     stage-setting opener, however, and as the album wears on it becomes     clear that ""This"" is by far the best track.</p>
<p>One problem is that the sound on <i>Another Day on Earth</i> is lush to the     point of distraction. It's almost as though Eno is hampered by his     undeniable studio mastery -- he knows how to make so many beautiful     sounds it would be a shame not to include them. Though he has in the     past relied on chance operations to give his music an unpredictable and     organic quality (""Honor thy mistake as a hidden intention,"" reads one     of     his Oblique Strategy cards) <i>Another Day on Earth</i> is produced to within     an inch of its life, with layers of intricate detail and the most     ethereal synth washes imaginable.</p>
<p>Still, overproduced or not, there is pleasure in sitting back and     letting Eno's sound wash over you. One highlight is ""How Many Worlds"",     which begins and with a simple acoustic guitar strum that Eno sings     over     and then adds is a plaintive string arrangement that weaves around     wafts     of electronic drone and builds to a powerful climax. The chord stabs on     ""Going Unconscious"" (which is essentially instrumental, with bits of     female vocals vaguely reminiscent of Laurie Anderson) remind me a lot     of     the palette from <i>Thursday Afternoon, and the bells that tinkle     throughout add an effective tension.</i></p>
<p>The melodies throughout <i>Another Day on Earth</i> are simple, which only     occasionally works to the record's advantage. ""And Then So Clear"" is     basic but true, though it will alienate some because Eno pitches his     voice up an octave with what may be the same robotic AutoTune Cher used     on ""Believe"". Leaving aside for a moment my affection for Cher's     biggest     hit, Eno's choice of processing suits both his voice and the song,     turning what could have been nothing more than new age drift into a     moving and fragile robotic lullaby. As if to illustrate the point about     the vocal processing, the later song ""Under"" has the exact same melody     as ""And Then So Clear"", this time sung by a small multracked chorus of     Enos, and it's not nearly as powerful.</p>
<p>""This"" is the album's only track that isn't either a ballad or an     amorphous moodscape that happens to have vocals. In terms of overall     feel <i>Another Day on Earth</i> sounds like Eno's 90s ambient work bent     slightly to fit into a song-oriented format. The dualistic     vocal/ambient     Eno filing scheme doesn't work with this one, which is refreshing in     its     way. But unfortunately <i>Another Day on Earth</i> is a decent album at best.</p></div>"|2808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2808-another-day-on-earth/|6.1|Mark Richardson

    record, <em>The World and Everything in It</em>. While their music stays
    within tight constraints, the lyrics touch upon waves, mountains, open
    air, outer space, drug cities, talking sharks, and being punk enough to
    get kicked out of your house downtown-- all in about 39 minutes.</p><p>
    
    Vocalist/guitarist Roman Kuebler's lyrics won't be the first thing
    you'll notice, however. The band's most distinguishing trait is Kuebler's
    formal, mannered singing, sounding like an pre-rock crooner or (oh boy)
    an angst-free Rob Dickinson. Along with the vintage tones from their sparse acoustic strumming and fuzzy guitar lines, his voice gives their power pop a touch of '50s garage-rock and doo-wop, enhancing the album's lazy summer feel and keeping one foot charmingly out of time.</p><p>
    
    ""Believe"" is an curious opener, merging a steady rock rhythm with
    twists in melody and a few bursts of Hammond organ, but the two ""wave"" songs
    are early highlights. ""Ride the Wild Wave"" moves on galloping eighth notes and falsetto backing vocals as
    Kuebeler sings of catching the elusive wave from <em>Endless Summer</em>
    and riding it around the world. ""Ride the Nuclear Wave"", on the other
    hand, might be the album's most spirited performance. While it may take
    two or three listens to seep in, there's an irresistible head-bobbing
    melody to be found in its ringing single-note guitar line and fantastical
    lyrics.</p><p>
    
    While the band constrains themselves to classic sounds, there's enough
    small surprises to give <em>The World and Everything in It</em> the
    variety it needs. ""Believe"" and the light picking of ""Drug City"" divert from
    the 4/4 guitar-and-drums arrangements, and the title track adds
    irregular stabs of organ and echo-chamber vocals to a southern blues shuffle,
    changing the atmosphere nicely. The nod to ""Rumble Blues"" before the
    speeding chords of ""Mountain"" or the staccato strumming seconds before
    ""Atmosphere"" kicks in are simple, effective tricks.</p><p>
    
    The Oranges Band's playing is impressive but never flashy, and the melodies are
    inviting without being cloying. <em>The World And Everything In It</em> is a
    perfect summer afternoon record, quietly and capably flowing from Track 1 through 12
    without a misstep.</p></div>"|6112.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6112-the-world-and-everything-in-it/|7.6|Jason Crock

There is the obvious (his label is called CockRockDisco), the explicit (his Web site is infested with photos of Carter Administration-era soirees at the Playboy Mansion and various pics of rollerdiscos and bitchin' decaled vans), to the baffling (his retired moniker of Donna Summer). Forrest typically perverts breakcore techno as the new prog. Many of his fired shots are peppered with samples of Frank Frazetta-painted Guitar God solos, breakbeat arraignments bloated with impatient ideas, and an overwhelming sense that everything was bought on discount at the Goodwill record bins.</p><p>
    However, Forrest is still an entertaining bastid who can provoke chuckles, furrowed eyebrows, and an unironic appreciation of trash. Case in point is how he mined the funkiest breakbeats from Alex Van Halen's trapkit in Tigerbeat6's sadly overlooked <em>Revenge of the Fight Club</em> 12"". Plus, a balding, Caucasian Jersey boy who named himself after disco's greatest Diva\xAA is almost criticism-proof.</p><p>
    Forrest's four tunes on <em>Lady Fantasy</em> include departures and pushes of his spattergore breaks taken to their self-immolating logic. Most notable is how Forrest gives the listener breathing space with his opening ambient-drone piece, ""The Work Ahead of Us"". David Grubbs marinates the song with guitar feedback, which enriches a rather mediocre synth ballad ailed by lackluster melodies. Despite the singes of distortion by its end, the song does not give a promising direction for Forrest, Which is why the ultra-violence of the following title track is welcome. He first begins by looping a classic Camelot-prog break that then gets cut off by a drum machine sputtering on its last fumes of gas and failing to launch into a groove. The absurdity is divine. ""The Lure of You"" is one of Forrest's best moments; he brings in Margareth Kamerer to sing some Cotton Belt roadhouse-blues while he hypnotizes with a mind-locking disco beat and a giddy new wave riff that seems stolen from Prince and the Revolution. Quite startling.</p><p>
    Closer ""Sperry and Foil"" is nearly as intriguing. Throughout its eight minutes, a snake charming, Egyptian Lover-style electro-funk jaunts morphs into a Maypole-dancing techno. A sublime moment quietly arises midway as melancholic jazz causes the song to sit in a corner and gaze around the room as if appreciating its last moments of life on earth. And then it's back to the Maypole. Overall, the juvenile delirium that trademarks Forrest is slightly defied. Let's hope that he surprises us when his new LP drops this fall.</p></div>"|3291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3291-lady-fantasy-ep/|7.5|Cameron Macdonald

The foursome's hype was glowing white-hot after 2004's splendid <em>The Emergency Response EP, but just a year later their career fizzled out like a bum Fourth of July sparkler, too intense and searing to sustain itself. A year of rigorous touring rendered their internal relationships as jagged and volatile as their staple post-punk sound, and by January 2005 the band was champing at the bit just for Jade Tree to digitally release their full length in late spring.</em></p><p>
    
    Fortunately, this strife hardly taints the consistent, clockwork precision of <em>The People of and Their Verses. For a band with their hands around each other's throats, Despistado manage to maintain breakneck tempos and tortuous song structures with the exactitude of prog but the immediacy and intimacy of punk. Whether or not the band knew this would be their last recording is debatable, but the album displays an undeniable prescience. There's a concerted effort to run the gamut between loud and soft, melodic and raucous, proto-punk and screamo, as if to leave no stone unturned. As a result, the LP fails to reproduce the incredibly dense and immaculately threaded string of ideas that decorated Despistado's EP, but the blemishes are far from glaring.</em></p><p>
    
    Headbanging opener ""Burning House"" sets a jolting tone early as frontman Dagan Harding and guitarist Leif Thorseth crash guitar riffs into each other beneath Harding's stratospheric howl, which uncannily resembles Cedric Bixler pre-Geddy Lee posturing. ""If Relationships a Construct, Then I'm a Construction Worker"" redeems its pretentiously indie title with a pinpoint central riff intricate enough to challenge even virtuosos the Advantage or Pretty Girls Make Graves. Okay, not to blow my riff load here, but just gimme one more-- the jaw-dropping ""Victim"". Bend-happy Thorseth struggles to keep his strings on the guitar until he and Harding fire intersecting raga riffs over a frenetic chorus.</p><p>
    
    Despistado stretch their talents thin, however, on mid-tempo numbers that fumble for the epic hook needed in justifying their length and lack of urgency. Melody isn't Harding's bread and butter, and some choruses fall flat without sufficient guitar and bass complementing. Regardless, the band exudes enough vigor to gloss over said weaknesses, most of which likely stem from their self-destructive work schedule in 2004. Although longevity is a commodity in the screamo/post-punk scene (see Cap'n Jazz, At the Drive-In, Sunny Day Real Estate, et al), this album, and to a greater extent Despistado's career, is sadly truncated before the brink of greatness.</p></div>"|2563.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2563-the-people-of-and-their-verses/|7.5|Adam Moerder

The band shares associations with the Notwist-- a hometown, members, brothers-- but up until that last record, their roles were still distinct. The Notwist were the ""rock"" ones, a hardcore outfit that turned to grand, electronically-sculpted, occasionally-boring indie; Lali Puna, on the other hand, dove a lot more fully into the electronics. Yes, they played like a band, and plenty of their material brought on the bass for some proper Germanic pulse. But their most distinctive moments-- as of 2001's <em>Scary World Theory</em>-- were the ones where the attenuated tick of a spaced-out beat popped through the mix, or singer Valerie Trebeljahr was left humming over a minimalist bed of synths. This is what we came to expect: Simple hums and airy whispers and sleepy like you wouldn't believe.</p><p>
    
    And then last year's <em>Faking the Books</em>, an album that had them trending nearly as rock-like as the Notwist. Not a bad move, market-wise, considering the success of the latter's <em>Neon Golden</em>. If you're anything like me, though, you made a bunch of unpleasant noises and took a pass. And if you're anything like me, you might be somewhat happier with <em>I Thought I was Over That</em>, which collects enough remixes, remixing, and rarities to fit with the mechanized camp where-- according to those of us who are still reading this review-- they probably belong. Just try not to remember that they're all collected snapshots from the band's past.</p><p>
    
    Not to say that it's all super-wonderful; some tracks are worth it, others aren't. The surprise is that it's as cohesive as it is, with remixers and remixes alike plumbing the same lines of soft-edged, computer-processed home-listening lullabies. Something about Lali Puna's full-band sound has always kept them distinct from their closest compu-pop cousins-- say, Styrofoam, Ulrich Schnauss, Dntel-- but fans of that cadre will find plenty here to like, assuming they haven't already snatched up the Morr Music releases a lot of these tracks hail from.</p><p>
    
    Nineteen tracks, and they all at least <em>sound</em> gorgeous. Dntel gets a softened, vocal-free treatment of ""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan""; it works even better now than in 2001, with its warm tones sounding something like the memory of a years-old favorite. Tamborello returns the favor with a Dntel remix of ""Faking the Books"", and an even better trade happens with Andy Weatherall's Two Lone Swordsmen project. They dub out ""Nin-com-pop"", pulling the Ultimate Remix Trick of changing the chords and leaving the vocal with a whole new character. Lali Puna lend the Swordsmen's ""It's Not the Worst I've Looked"" their usual combination of humming synths and clean guitar.</p><p>
    
    Anyone who missed Morr Music's compilation of Slowdive covers can use this to catch up on Lali Puna's version of ""40 Days"", a head-nodding whisper of a shoegazer classic. Culling from Morr also offers the album's highlight, an atypically sinister collaboration with Bomb the Bass called ""Clear Cut""-- plus two EP tracks, and another whispering cover of Giorgio Moroder and Philip Oakey's ""Together in Electric Dreams"". The second half of the collection-- Lali Puna remixed-- skews even further into the machines, with Boom Bip revving ""Micronomic"" into a race of acoustic guitars, To Rococo Rot getting all blippy-baroque on ""Grin and Bear,"" and Alias and Sixtoo both letting some foreign sound buzz in contrast through the backgrounds of their contributions.</p><p>
    
    Which is what we're looking for, right? That old warm-and-sleepy Lali Puna vibe suffuses everything here. Anyone miffed by the turn on <em>Faking the Books</em> should be pleased with the handy look back this collection represents. And anyone miffed by nothing at all-- anyone up for some of that Morr Music product that <em>doesn't</em> just sound like Ida with some IDM beats-- will find this a pretty decent return on the ear-candy investment; not a lot of motion, but more than enough soft sound to sink into.</p></div>"|4649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4649-i-thought-i-was-over-that-rare-remixed-and-b-sides/|7.0|Nitsuh Abebe

When the Fall and their labels began work on the compilation, this was not the case-- at that time, it was a document of a living, ongoing relationship between one of Britain's greatest bands and its most legendary DJ, John Peel. But Peel passed away last year, ending a seemingly effortless decades-long run as one of the coolest people on earth, and this six-disc document of his favorite band's appearances on his show instead serves as a sort of encomium. It's at once a tribute to the brilliance of Mark E. Smith and his ""always different, always the same"" band, and to the dedication of a man who never stopped being a fan and never stopped loving new and challenging music.</p><p>
    The Fall recorded 24 four-song sessions for Peel over the course of 26 years, capturing nearly every one of the band's many configurations in all their sloppy precision, and this sprawling, amazing release makes the case that every one of them had at least something interesting to offer, including the less-appreciated Fall line-ups of the mid-to-late-90s. The case could even be made that this is the definitive look at the Fall's career to date-- even more than last year's very well-considered <em>50,000 Fall Fans Can't Be Wrong compilation. Of course, at six discs and more than seven hours, it's not the place to start, but anyone with more than four or five Fall albums would be doing themselves a huge service picking this up.</em></p><p>
    To touch on all of the highlights, I'd have to devote a full paragraph to each individual session included on the set, so let's just say that this thing is absolutely loaded, with performances that frequently eclipse the studio versions. The 1980 version of ""New Face In Hell"" is thunderous and Smith's cracking, hysterical vocal is hilariously psychotic-- the band's oft-hidden sense of humor easy to spot. Smith actually laughs on ""Beatle Bones 'n' Smokin' Stones"", and the band's December 1994 piss-take on ""Jingle Bell Rock"" is a case study in sarcastic destruction.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, you get two 1983 sessions from the band's mighty double-drummer lineup and a generous offering from the unstoppable mid-80s lineup that produced <i>This Nation's Saving Grace</i> and the <i>Wonderful &amp; Frightening World of the Fall</i>. The <i>TNSG</i> songs hit like a hammer to the head, with a borderline out-of-control take on ""Spilt Victorian Child"" (my favorite Fall song) and a crunching, hypnotic reinvention of ""L.A."" leading the way. As one might expect, the first three discs, which reach up through 1987, are the strongest and most consistent, with the last three discs veering through ever more rapid line-up shifts and wider stylistic ground.</p><p>
    What's shocking is the way those last three discs paint a picture of the band's late career as nearly as vital as what preceded it. Fiddler Kenny Brady brings a stronger melodic underpinning to the 1989 and 1991 recordings, without compromising the band's signature rough groove, while some of the band's more electronic 90s material comes off much rawer and crunchier in the live setting. ""Immortality"" in particular becomes fire-breathing, heavy death funk of a caliber the Fall only sporadically achieved in the studio during that phase of their career.</p><p>
<em>The Complete Peel Sessions, 1978-2004 is one of the most straightforward titles a Fall compilation has ever had, and the execution of the package is similarly no-nonsense: The recordings are sequenced in strict chronological order and the remastering is uniformly crisp and sharp, something that's not always the case with retrospectives of this band. It's an embarrassment of riches for the Fall's devoted cult of fans, none of whom should pass this up, and it works surprisingly well for more casual fans who've only just begun to delve into the band's bewildering back catalog.</em></p></div>"|2978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2978-the-complete-peel-sessions-1978-2004/|9.3|Joe Tangari

Her acoustic-based music soundtracks a hangover, or the scary part of a mushroom binge-- which is different than saying it sounds good when you're hung over or strung out. Rather, her kind of folk music is closer to real life than I want to be in the darkest moments, only intermittently letting the light peek through. Through blurry layers of harmonium, multi-tracked (though not always harmonized) vocals, piano, acoustic guitar, wooden blocks of percussion and bells, she's got more in common with an abstract expressionist painter than a folk musician, using her palette to fill in the details of subconscious experience. Somehow, this doesn't end up sounding overwrought or pretentious. It's a ""naive"" sound, even when I wonder how hard it is to be naive when you're tracking six instruments and polyphonic vocals on every song. Nevertheless, she's kindred to Charalambides, Syd Barrett, and many of her Fonal label mates in this regard: strangely accomplished, but alien and evocative of nothing in particular.</p><p>
    
    Her debut (last year's <em>Meritie) showed promise, but I found it lacking in melody-- which is to say, in exchange for abstraction I usually crave a firm base in reality, obscured or otherwise. Islaja's music is tough to analyze because it's admirably insular. Where, say, Animal Collective draw upon Brazilian music or psychedelic folk, Islaja is only really ""folk"" by association. Her instrumentation and preferred acoustic ambience remind me of someone's traditional music, even if I don't know whose it would be. She continues along these lines on </em><em>Palaa Aurinkoon</em> (roughly translated to ""burn sun"" and recorded in Glasgow, Scotland of all places), though does sometimes add a bit more rhythmic pulse to her pieces.</p><p>
    
    ""Rukki"" is an interesting song using Islaja's voice-- a distant, repeated two-note figure, and ""ai-oh, ah"" whispers-- as the base over which buzzing synth (?) noise and minor-chord strummed guitar flesh out atmospheres like a visual artist might use flickering, subtly morphing figures around the edge of a central, fuzzy image. Some listeners might want to know what the song is about, but given its elements, I think artist Frank Stella's creed of ""what you see is what you see"" applies. I could peer into these songs for days, but might very well come to the conclusion that it's my own psyche under the microscope rather than Islaja's music.</p><p>
    
    Songs like ""Laivat Saapuu"" and the title track offer what seem like more accessible inroads to the heart of her music, but mislead. The former begins with the toll of toy bells and the singer's high-pitched melody, reminiscent of none other than Devendra Banhart's first record of four-track songs. However, when the saxophones (!) enter with a plaintive drone, the song loses its forward momentum, settling like scum on a swampy lagoon. Her vocals form ""la-la"" patterns that fall under the mini-clang, and before I realize what's happened, the whole song seems to have turned itself upside down. Things really don't settle until the closer ""Rukous"", which uses harmonium and recorders that sound like small train whistles to set up a simple, male-female vocal duet.</p><p>
    
    Regardless of the references I made earlier, Islaja doesn't really sound like anyone else. That works to her advantage for the most part, but if you want a more conventionally attractive ride, <em>Palaa Aurinkoon</em> may leave you feeling malnourished. Still, emotionally interesting musicians who don't immediately make me think of someone else are rare enough that I'm willing to follow along just on principle. In the best cases, abstraction illuminates something vital.</p></div>"|4162.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4162-palaa-aurinkoon/|7.6|Dominique Leone

    600,000 units in its first week. Eight years later, in <em>The Wu-Tang
    Manual</em>, RZA marks '97 as a turning point, when he began
    ""converting Wu from the dictatorship it had been to a democracy.""
    Maybe Ezra Pound was onto something when he famously argued that
    fascism was beneficial art: The democratic incarnation of Wu-Tang has
    birthed stellar efforts from Ghostface and RZA, but has also turned
    out some forgettable solo joints and spotty group albums. Method Man
    seems to be spending more time on screen than on wax. Cappadonna's
    driving a taxi in Baltimore. Dirty passed on. ""After the laughter...""</p><p>
    Mathematics has been a quiet Clan associate since day one-- he
    designed their famous logo (an early draft had a hand clutching a
    hilariously gory severed head sticking out of the now-iconic W), and
    contributed RZA-sanctioned beats for albums like Ghost's <em>Supreme
    Clientele</em> and Meth's <em>Tical 2000: Judgment Day</em>. On his
    second LP, Mathematics succeeds where other recent Wu efforts have
    faltered by keeping it hot and simple. Instead of trying to push
    things forward, Math sticks to the basics, and <em>The Problem</em>
    plays like a subtly modernized précis of vintage '90s Wu-Tang styles.
    Should've been called <em>The Solution</em>: Take mid-to-up-tempo,
    cinematic beats and use them for blazing posse cuts that mingle the
    entirety of the Clan (including Dirt) with competent Nü-Tangers like
    Eyeslow, Hot Flames, and Bald Head; repeat as necessary.</p><p>
<em>The Problem</em> opens with a reminisce, natch: ""C What I C"", where
    Mathematics's skittering drums and snake-charming melody pave the way
    for Eyeslow and T-Slugz to reprise the street-reportage/pining for
    simpler times themes of ""Can It Be All So Simple""-- see also the
    beautifully expressive horns of the elegiac ""Tommy"". ""Strawberries and
    Cream"" is a honeyed, profane slow-jam with a watery soul melody
    (remember ""Love Jones""?) and swaggering romantic raps from RZA and
    Ghost (one hopes his line about ""high school pussy"" is a reminisce as
    well). Where was U-God on that one? </p><p>
    You've got your party jams: ""John 3:16"", where Meth monkeys around on
    a springy  cartoon beat, sing-songing hooks and punchlines (""got
    Milton Bradley hating the game"") like Nelly with a personality;
    ""Rush"", which pits Meth's rubber chickens against GZA's precisely
    clipped fingernail rhymes; the bounce-funk club banger ""Two Shots of
    Henny"". Then there are the thrillingly grim tracks: ""Winta Sno"" gets
    stupid frosty with silvery minor chords and nihilistic crime rhymes;
    Ghost and Rae slang-bang ""Real Nillaz"" over frantic drums and skeletal
    metallic accents; on ""U.S.A."" the bombastic spook-house synths are
    well-contrasted by Masta Killa's stark straight-talk. There's
    something sly about imbuing all new songs with a ""best-of"" aura, and
    it makes for a strong Wu release. </p></div>"|5651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5651-the-problem/|7.5|Brian Howe

And though this line is delivered with typically exaggerated carny theatricality, there's little on the Icelandic one-man band's third album that enables listeners to dismiss the lyric's sentiment entirely.</em></p><p>
    On his exceptional 2003 debut <i>Lonely Mountain</i>, Mugison brought various streams of bedroom folk, junkyard experimentation, and haphazard electronic pop into some form of unruly convergence. Unfortunately, on <em>Mugimama this prospective unification seems frustratingly distant , as Mugison appears determined to keep the toys from his assorted sandboxes carefully separated, resulting in an occasionally brilliant yet disjointed stylistic grab-bag.</em></p><p>
    A bona-fide pop star in Iceland, Mugi (as he is evidently known back home) recently beat out Björk for Best Pop Album and Best Song at the Icelandic national music awards. And on <em>Mugimama's strongest tracks, these accolades are easily understood. ""Murr Murr"", the song that took home top honors, is a propulsive blur of folkish pop driven by nimble acoustic guitar and Mugi's impassioned vocals, while opener ""I Want You"" sounds like Beck at his most starkly emotive, its strangely pleading lyrics (""Let's go dancing like we talked about/ I'll be the weird boy and you can shout"") delivered with semi-crazed intensity over a lurching glitchy backdrop of plinked guitars and nosediving bass.</em></p><p> 
    Another two of the album's highlights-- ""2 Birds"" and ""I'd Ask""-- will sound instantly familiar to any attentive Mugison fans, since variants of each also appeared on his 2004 release <i>Niceland</i>. On these tracks, with his girlfriend Rúna pitching in on additional vocals, Mugi performs with an almost alt-country earthiness, his voice carrying a rather uncanny likeness to Will Oldham circa <i>Arise, Therefore</i>. This rusticity is further amplified on the piano-based ""What I Would Say In Your Funeral"", on which he and Rúna wittily exchange elegies like ""I would tell 'em how I never liked you at allÉthe way you made me sleep on the wet spot.""</p><p>
<i>Mugimama</i> runs itself into trouble, however, in its abrupt segues from these placidly homespun tracks to the jarringly sharp edges of hyperactive pieces like the aforementioned ""Sad as a Truck"" or the woozy electronic burble of ""The Chicken Song"", whose lyrics again feature Mugi and Rúna trading oddball non-sequiters in wild near-whispers (""I want to be intellectual...I'm not a vegetarian/ But I like sitting in the grass/ I don't like them thongs/ But I love tits and ass"") before Mugi makes with a couple Princely howls. Though not without their entertainment value, these songs (as well others like the silly mouth-farting exercise ""Swing Ding"") sound like stowaways from different albums, bearing as much resemblance to their counterparts here as giraffes do to pack mules. And as the album comes to a close with the goofy harmonica breakdown ""Afi Minn"", one has to wonder, as sporadically delightful as <i>Mugimama</i> can be, what new ground Mugison has actually here gained.</p></div>"|5614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5614-mugimama-is-this-monkey-music/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

    his ""craftsmanship."" Indeed, the surest sign of craft is its
    inconspicuousness. All art is artifice, yeah, but great art, even at
    its most self-referential, transcends mathematic precision to touch
    the soul. Over the first three Pernice Brothers albums,
    singer/songwriter Joe Pernice gathered quiet acclaim for his lush,
    orchestral guitar-pop-- and his supposedly immaculate, Brian
    Wilson-informed songcraft. On fourth studio outing, <em>Discover a
    Lovelier You</em>, the former Scud Mountain Boys bandleader listens too
    well to his supporters, manufacturing plenty of textbook ""pretty
    melodies"" that turn out to be pretty forgettable.</p><p>
    June release date notwithstanding, the
    Pernices' latest is not a summer record. Sure, <em>Discover a Lovelier
    You</em> offers more of the 1970s light-rock sheen of 2003's
    Fourth-of-July-fronted <em>Yours, Mine &amp; Ours</em>. Here, though,
    Pernice borrows the cold distance of '80s Anglo-pop hinted at on
    earlier songs like ""Sometimes I Remember"", and follows the lead of
    fellow Smiths-enamored former alt-country troubadours Ryan Adams
    (circa 2003's EP-twofer-turned-LP <em>Love Is Hell</em>) and Josh Rouse
    (particularly on this year's <em>Nashville</em>). Then there's Pernice's
    usual cryptic melancholy. And, uh, all those lyrics about ice and
    snow.</p><p>
    Those lyrics: I could always see the ""craft"" in Pernice's genteel,
    Left Banke-inspired melodies, but when it comes to words he's
    typically received more praise than deserved, maybe because he's got
    an MFA (whoopedy-doo!). Pernice too often traffics in turgid phrases
    rather than complete thoughts, epitomized in the omg wtf chorus of ""My
    So-Called Celibate Life"": ""It's a short slide down/ No caution
    navigating the faulted ground."" That's not pop, dude. That's poor. The
    O. Henry affectations and Magnetic Fields synths of ""Sell Your Hair""
    are clever and all, but every time you awkwardly rephrase clichés, I
    die a little. Hey kids, get this: ""There's nothing quite as pretty as
    the one you can never hold""! And, uh, Joe, dig the mournful harmonica
    on ""Saddest Quo"", but what's ""a head of tetra cyclic cattle""? Good
    thing the title track is instrumental, huh?</p><p>
    It's nice that Pernice and brethren like pretty melodies and glossy
    production. It's to their credit that they release their music on
    their own tiny label-- just like Black Flag! Jeez, <em>Discover a
    Lovelier</em> you isn't really even a bad album, only unremarkably OK.
    Form follows function, and art too reliant on form will inevitably be
    ephemeral.</p></div>"|6241.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6241-discover-a-lovelier-you/|5.8|Marc Hogan

[Deluxe Edition]|1113.0|DJ Shadow|['Rap', 'Electronic']|0.0|0.0|1.0|"[""Mo'Wax""]"|2005-06-09 00:00:00|1996|2016-06-11 20:58:02.011994|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1lfaxd2m9kw.1.6:0.1.0.$2377/=1$2377.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Ask the NoCal turntable nerds, the trip-hoppers, the frat boys, the hippies or the ravers stoned on the beach at sunrise: <em>Endtroducing...</em> is deeply spiritual. Not in the conventional sense, but in the spirituality of the soul that lives in your chest and got there from the ether and returns to the collective unconscious-- the one you feel when you <em>feel</em> things. That's the spirit that saves us from being fleeting and disposable: If I necked with that one girl that one sunset, with <em>Endtroducing</em> on the car stereo, then no matter who else did the same thing, I'm me and that moment's still mine. Dig?</p><p><em>Endtroducing</em> taps that inner-whatever better than most of the albums of its day, and it swims so easily that it established an entire genre of instrumental hip-hop-- count how many records come out every month and are dubbed ""Shadowesque."" Building the album from samples of lost funk classics and bad horror soundtracks, Shadow crossed the real with the ethereal, laying heavy, sure-handed beats under drifting, staticky textures, friendly ghost voices, and chords whose sustain evokes the vast hereafter. Even the ""look at me"" cuts like ""The Number Song"" didn't break the mood; the album was so perfect and the technique, so awesome that it's still definitive today, and Shadow has yet to top it. (Never mind that if Four Tet could swing a record as proficient as <em>The Private Press</em>, we would throw him a parade.)</p><p>For this Deluxe Edition, <em>Endtroducing</em> hasn't been enhanced or remastered, but it now comes with a bonus disc of remixes and singles, including Cut Chemist's fantastic ""party mix"" of ""The Number Song"" and Gift of Gab's rhymes on ""Midnight in a Perfect World"", as well as alternate versions that give a useful perspective on the album. For example, ""Building Steam With a Grain of Salt"" and ""Mutual Slump"" omit the overdubbed speech, and without it, the samples seem naked and duller-- which highlights one of the album's subtler strengths.</p>
<p>But Shadow can't avoid the irony that this is a revival of an album that revives other albums. We could be hearing this music, not for the second time around, but for the third and maybe the fourth. The buzz of these dug-up sounds infuses the texture of the album; focusing on it reminds me of the few times that I've heard an album by a deceased performer and actually realized he had passed-- like the time I listened to <em>Kind of Blue</em> the night that Miles Davis joined three of its personnel in the grave, and felt their absence, even while their solos hadn't lost a shred of vitality.</p>
<p>Shadow clearly gets that. In the documentary <em>Scratch</em>, Shadow takes us to the record store where he found most of the vinyl used on <em>Endtroducing</em>. Upstairs we see the regular shelves and bins, but downstairs, in the basement, are tens of thousands of old albums stacked or dumped all over the room, barely lit by a few light bulbs and littered with dust and dead bats. Shadow patronized the store for five years before they let him in this crypt, and as he says in the documentary, ""Just being in here is a humbling experience for me, because you're looking through all these records and it's sort of like a big pile of broken dreams...Whether you want to admit it or not, 10 years down the line you'll be in here. So keep that in mind when you start thinking like, 'I'm invincible and I'm the world's best,' or whatever. Because that's what all these cats thought.""</p>
<p>We usually dismiss reissues of CDs as the ultimate cash-in-- the most cynical way for artists like Elvis Costello to charge us again and again for the same album. We think this because we assume that once you commit music to a disc and put it in a store, it's immortal. But without new attention and rereleases, albums can drift off the radar. Today, <em>Entroducing</em> may be a legend of the 1990s, but the world of beat-driven music regularly throws away old milestones to make room for new ones. How do we know this album will impress-- let alone connect with-- anyone 10 or 20 years down the road?</p>
<p>So you could call this rerelease Shadow's first bid for a legacy, and his admission that no matter how many fans called <em>Endtroducing</em> a masterpiece, someone else needs to slap that word on the cover for the next batch of kids. Yet even more than the first time, this is also a meditation on mortality. Shadow knows what it's like to wander through that basement, find some buried treasure-- some sax riff like those immortal notes on ""What Does Your Soul Look Like, (Pt. 1 - Blue Sky Revisit)""-- and resurrect it for millions of listeners, like an irrational God on beats 'n breaks Judgment Day. And he also knows how it feels to be in that bin, like all of us on the way to our own graves, where we'll be trapped with all the other goners-- hoping someone will see something a little different and special in us, that might pull us out of the pile.</p></div>"|2377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2377-endtroducing-deluxe-edition/|10.0|Chris Dahlen

Throughout their decade-plus career the Dirtbombs have used the format precisely as nature intended: Stocking their wide and sundry A-sides with all their choicest cuts while using their B-sides to stash away half-baked experiments, weird cover versions and a dazzling assortment of non-album strays.</p><p>
    
    Since the Dirtbombs have released their impressive multitudes of 7"" EPs, split-singles, and compilation tracks on an unruly array of tiny labels across the globe, hunting all of them down would previously have required ample cash, shrewd timing, and fancy footwork. Thankfully, however, that changes with the release of <em>If You Don't Already Have a Look</em>-- a mammoth two-disc, 52-song collection that assembles all of the band's hardest-to-find rarities along with a generous selection of previously unreleased material, and eight brand new tracks.</p><p>
    
    Featuring one disc of originals and one of covers, as well as a lavish booklet of photos and liner notes, the set provides the group's established fans with an outrageous embarrassment of riches, while giving latecomers a stupefying crash course in the Dirtbombs' lo-tech, casually explosive soul-punk.</p><p>
    
    Anchored by the multi-talented Mick Collins-- formerly of primitive rock demi-legends the Gories and Blacktop-- this set's most immediately striking characteristic is its sheer consistency of quality, as there are scarcely any absolute throwaway performances lurking among these 52 tracks. (Which is astounding when you consider some of them were originally destined to become flipsides in New Zealand.)</p><p>
    
    Granted, things get awfully raw on abrasive bash-ups like ""I'm Saving Myself For Nichelle Nichols"" or the self-explanatory ""They Hate Us In Scandinavia"", but these brief (often 1 minute or less) dissonant interludes here merely serve as palate-cleansers between such irresistible originals as ""The Sharpest Claws"" or the mirror-ball swagger of ""Here Comes That Sound Again."" On these tracks Collins repeatedly proves his astonishing versatility as a vocalist-- his nonchalantly soulful pipes draw easy comparison to early Arthur Lee-- and his underrated prowess as a guitarist, particularly since he operates in a genre that puts little premium on technical ability.</p><p>
    
    As satisfying as the Dirtbombs' originals are, however, the real fun on <em>If You Don't Already Have a Look</em> begins when you move to the all-covers disc two. Though this set features a couple predictable choices (the Stones, Stevie Wonder, In the Red labelmates Cheater Slicks) there's also a fantastic abundance of oddball selections from such acts as Yoko Ono, Lou Rawls, ESG, and Soft Cell. On each of these covers-- whether it's on their dubbed-out remake of ""Mystified"" by the Romantics (!) or their genuinely heartfelt delivery of the Bee Gees' ""I Started a Joke"", the Dirtbombs display their uncanny talent for distilling a song down to its most primal, molten essence-- exposing unsuspected depths of bare emotion that are now fully amplified as the listener finally gets a chance to hear all of these marvels back-to-back.</p></div>"|2532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2532-if-you-dont-already-have-a-look/|8.2|Matthew Murphy

Take a listen to that first track, ""Spoonin' Rap"", cut back when Gabriel Jackson was all of 16. His bravado and charm instantly place him in a continuum where you can believe Spoonie was an original member of the Treacherous Three. On the other hand, Spoonie's conversational savoir faire looks forward to a time where rappers skimmed over the beat and didn't make like an end-rhyming red bouncing ball. And he was doing it for a good five or six minutes at a time, as all MCs did back in the day, when rap still dangled from disco's umbilical cord. ""Love Rap"" bears some of that baby fat. Spoonie himself rightfully claims this track is one of the first attemps to pitch woo yes-yes-y'all style. Unlike future luva-luvas like Cool James, Spoonie respectfully bumrushes ladies with his rapid-fire flow-- ""I got a cure for all women, and hope you understand/ Why they call me Spoonie Gee, the medicine man/ Because I do it with greed and not too much speed/ So just take off your clothes, lemme give you what you need"". Spoonie proves he can run at different speeds, though-- ""The Big Beat"" is more prescient of the cool and confident 60-minute-man approach LL and his type of guys perfected.</p><p>
    
    This retrospective veers from enjoyable in its own right to stodgy historical document with a couple of duff tracks in the middle (the smudged white lining of ""Street Girl"", and the stiff chirpy ""Get Off My Tip""), but then rights the ship quickly. ""Yum Yum"" finds a swaggering Spoonie slapping ""toast"" in front of his ""master of ceremonies"" appelation, and is followed by ""Take It Off"" doin' da butt DC go-go style. Tracks like ""The Godfather"" (produced by hip-hop pioneer Marley Marl) and ""Hit Man"" (produced by future New Jack Swing king Teddy Riley) are decent enough tracks from an older and wiser version of Spoonie Spoon, but, as this disc presents it, Spoonie was at his best spitting non-stop rhymes over skeletal beats, filling the gaps in the tracks with his unending charisma.</p><p>
    
    The final track of this compilation, ""You's an Old Fool"", hearkens back to those days, looping the now-well-worn sample of the Honeydrippers' ""Impeach the President"" so Spoonie can hold court on the sorts of fellas that date (and get played by) the girls who still might be a twinkle in their daddies' eyes. It's a sign of those times (back in 1987) that Spoonie doesn't overwhelm the track-- here, the music is the hook, not the MC. As such, it comes off as a track featuring Spoonie Gee rather than a Spoonie Gee track.

Along with DJ Crook, the product brings the moodiness of Deftones' later work (their song ""Teenager"" has been a widely-used but apt comparison point) with little of its hardness, and builds it all from drum loops.</p>
<p>However, that was back in 2001, until someone leaked the album to the Internet, causing the band to quickly shelve it. Since then, the songs have changed considerably and the stable of guest musicians has grown to include Mike Patton, Melissa Auf Der Mar, Zach Hill (Hella), Mary Timony (Helium), and Rob Crow (of Pinback, Heavy Vegetable, Thingy, and probably three other projects started during the nap I took before finishing this review. The man loves to work).</p>
<p>First song ""Ataraxia"" builds from electronic drums and growling bass, with some bright guitar picking and a bit of piano, before hitting the wall-of-guitar melodrama that Deftones have used in songs like ""Be Quiet and Drive"" or ""Minerva"". ""Your Skull Is Red"" features pulverizing drumming from Zach Hill, but i'ts indiscriminate guitar sludge with a lot of atmosphere but no hook. That and ""Live From the Stage"" are no more than jam sessions, and the finely-tuned gloss of tracks like ""Ataraxia"" shows those songs up. Even ""Blvd. Knights"", with its ill-fit tempo-changing climax and verse parts audible under the heavy guitars in the chorus, point towards hasty execution.</p>
<p>""Ever (Foreign Flag)"", however, steps further into ambience while keeping the melodrama and electronic beats. It builds upon the gentler influences beneath Deftones' material (early Cure and Depeche Mode, who they've both covered) but it's far enough removed from Deftones to really justify this project. ""Ever Since WWI"" is another success, a slow strum that's cathartic without ever dialing up the distortion, likely because of Zach Hill's peerless bass drum action.</p>
<p>Calling Rob Crow a ""guest"" is misleading; he takes lead vocal duties for four songs, and most of those sound markedly like Pinback. He croons over ""Princeton Review"", a gentle guitar strum with a skittering loop that shifts tone with an ominous percussive breakdown. Mary Timony is featured on the dour ""Tomb of Liegia"", an atonal dirge that's the low point of the record.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while none of the guests are phoning it in (the visible ones, anyway), they never learn much from each other. Even though he's sharing time with Moreno on ""Our Ride to the Rectory"", Crow's parts could just as easily be cut'n'pasted from one of his own songs. ""Elizabeth"" is similarly stuck in Pinback mode, though it's spiced up by an unbelievably brief moment of blistering electronic drums. I never thought I'd be calling Team Sleep ""conservative,"" but holding back the harsher elements in this track to seven whole seconds almost proves my point: The artists here could have taken more chances, because this album hints at a fascinating and rewarding listen.</p>
<p>I say ""hints"" because those moments are few on a record that just drifts by the listener's ears. It's short on hooks, but it isn't necessarily aimless just restrained. It's no surprise that one of the bands' songs was used on the <i>Matrix Revolution</i>; these songs are appropriate soundtracks to hyper-real, stylized encounters. Even the lyrics to the beat-driven misstep ""King Diamond"" view a male/female encounter in video game terms, with it's ""start...restart"" shouting and subtle variations. It's the kind of music for which Windows Media Player visualizations were made. If this had been released in 2001, it could have followed the market of electronic-dabbling modern rock compiled on the original <i>Matrix</i> soundtrack, and ran towards success. Today, it's background noise, make-out music for teenagers with lip piercings and caked eyeliner. I respect their effort to blend genre, and while Team Sleep is executed with taste, it's without the risks that should accompany any project calling itself ""experimental.""</p></div>"|8293.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8293-team-sleep/|6.1|Jason Crock

    ""twee"" (by definition ""<em>overly</em> precious"") was, like ""emo,"" a
    term critics used, not self-respecting performers-- a too-pat label
    denoting any band more interested in sunny days, clever hooks, Sarah
    Records and/or Belle &amp; Sebastian than power chords and faux-rebellious
    posturing. Tullycraft torpedoed my theory three years
    ago with ""Twee"", a splickety indie-pop artifact that zoomed in on a
    whole twee lifestyle with the high-detail focus of a fashion reporter,
    singer/bassist Sean Tollefson sqeaking, ""Fuck me, I'm twee!"" An even
    earlier song is titled ""Pop Songs Your New Boyfriend Is Too Stupid to
    Know About"". Fuck <em>me</em>, meta-twee!</p><p>
    
    Tullycraft bring the meta-twee once more on fourth album
    <em>Disenchanted Hearts Unite</em>, their second for Portland, Ore.
    label Magic Marker. Sounding like a cuddlier Weakerthans, Tollefson
    and co-vocalist Jenny Mears sing about completist punk-rock record
    collections (catchy opener ""Stowaway""), getting ""indie-famous"" (""Fall
    4 U""), tearing the White Stripes off the wall (""Leaders of the New
    School""), the Murder City Devils (""Polaroids from Mars""), and ""the
    b-band queen of the music scene"" who ""sold 100 records to all her
    friends"" (""Girl About Town""). ""Despite my best attempts, I couldn't
    make you love me with a song,"" Tollefson sings on keyboard-dorked
    ""Every Little Thing"" after name-checking messageboards and comparing
    his heartbeat to phone-transmitted techno. Such insular scene-gazing
    may put off some, but will ring true with a tiny, happy subculture.</p><p>
    
    However, <em>Disenchanted</em> sees Tullycraft expanding its
    tweer-than-tweeness to encompass more adult topics. One of the
    stronger songs, ""Our Days in Kansas"", jumps with slow-dance arpeggios
    and punky rave-ups from a ""disco bloodbath for the ages"" (""oh-oh,
    oh-oh!"") to ""sometimes I wish we'd kept the baby."" Earlier: ""I never
    learned the K.U. fight song,"" a perfect detail to express the short
    duration of a failed romance. On anthemic ""Polaroid From Mars"",
    Tollefson laments, ""We woke up next to different people/ And the
    difference found us here."" But the best songs are still tracks like
    closer ""Secretly Minnesota"", which plays with the amusing notion of a
    formerly Midwestern recordstore employee who passes for a native Santa
    Monican-- ""no one wised to the 4-H clover key chain/ Or just how
    much she loved the rain""-- while casually quipping,
    ""Ricky says that my band's just a Sebadoh rip-off."" The hook is the
    album's most infectious, and stands up with any of the band's peers'.</p><p>
    
    While the choruses to ""Leaders of the New School"" and ""Polaroids of
    Mars"" (and, while I'm being crusty, sort of ""Rumble With the Gang
    Debs"") are a little too similar, <em>Disenchanted</em> is a solid,
    self-conscious indie-pop record for solid (i.e. presumably not liquid)
    self-conscious indie-pop fans. Another of the best songs, ""Molly's Got
    a Crush on Us"" (""we almost always play for crowds of 12""), was
    recorded live at a party. ""We're the best band you never heard,""
    Tollefson proclaims, a goofy chorus of friends echoing that <em>Rolling
    Stone</em> et al. hypeline for bands with two or fewer Pitchfork
    reviews. Maybe. But crowds of 12 across the country are likely to
    think so, and that's probably meta-OK.</p></div>"|8294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8294-disenchanted-hearts-unite/|6.8|Marc Hogan

On the 15 tracks collected on the souvenir album, <i>Live From Austin TX (as if you need to qualify Austin with a state name), he plays guitar with an efficiency that's almost corporate, deploying melodic filigrees that downsize all but the most crucial notes and draw on a highly personal style enriched by Celtic and folk traditions, American rock and jazz, and even a little reggae. To redirect the business metaphor slightly: On this CD, Thompson could be a guitar salesman demonstrating his product. </i><i>See how simple it is to sound like three guitars at once. Now you too you can mimic a banjo or a slide guitar in your home or office.</i></p><p>
    
    In other words, Thompson makes it all-- the gamboling solos; the booming vocals; the often humorous, biting lyrics-- seem so easy. That's both the attraction and the flaw of this live album: its technical proficiency is amazing, but at times a little cold. This isn't really Thompson's fault, but an unavoidable logistical circumstance, as his recorded appearance episode ran well beyond CD capacity. Almost all of his stage banter (which was minimal to begin with) has been excised to squeeze in as many songs as possible. Even then, the nearly eight-minute, show-closing ""Put It There Pal"" had to go too. (The full concert is available on DVD.)</p><p>
    
    Thompson played ""Austin City Limits"" in July 2001, just four months after his Capitol Records best-of, <i>Action Packed, marked the end of his 11-year tenure at the label. So the bulk of the tracklist comes from that era, with particular attention to 1999's underrated </i><i>Mock Tudor</i> (too bad ""Cibella"", a personal favorite, wasn't included). Backed by an equally professional rhythm section-- Michael Jerome on drums and Danny Thompson on stand-up bass-- Thompson opens with a jubilantly defiant version of ""Cooksferry Queen"", about a suburban businessman in love with an inner-city hippie, then follows it up with a starkly intense ""Uninhabited Man"" and a bouncy ""Walking the Long Miles Home"". But the highlights of the first half of the set predate <i>Mock Tudor</i>: ""All Bowlly's in Heaven"" is a dark jazz lament, and ""Mingus Eyes"" sounds desperate and fittingly duplicitous.</p><p>
    
    Thompson plays an acoustic guitar during that first half of the show, then switches to an electric for the second half, which adds grit to ""Bathsheba Smiles"" and noir moodiness to ""Ghost in the Wind"". He spits venom on the caustic ""She Twists the Knife"", but the reggae rhythms of ""Crawl Back (Under My Stone)"" lead nicely into a call and response with the audience that's easily the most unguarded moment on the album. That is, until Thompson picks up his acoustic again for the closer, ""1952 Vincent Black Lightning"". It's one of his most popular late-career songs, and he's probably played it too many times to count. But he invests it with what sounds like fresh and bottomless heartache, making the story of young lovers and vintage motorcycles seem all the more tragically inevitable. Thompson's a man who obviously loves his work.</p></div>"|8026.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8026-live-from-austin-tx/|7.6|Stephen M. Deusner

In that sense, the tag becomes more like shorthand to describe a singer-songwriter who doesn't spill his every weepy desire. But I've never really bought into the idea that Callahan is an exotic, unknowable creature, and I've never bought into the idea that his work has to be inscrutable (or let's be more rock critic-y and say ""inaccessible"") to be effective.</p>
<p>Even at his least explicit, Callahan's music comes across as an honest assessment of its creator. For that, he's sometimes also labeled a jerk and a misogynist, among other things, but that may be the price of doing business for an artist who refuses to paint himself in the rosy hues of everlasting love or the antique sepia of ""heartfelt"" loss-- in short, refusing to paint over his own complexity. The existential nature of Callahan's music has been touched on before, as he presents himself allegorically in his albums-- a hash of emotions, desires, and needs, frequently uncertain of the world beyond the nose on his face, aware only of himself and his mortality, and, most crucially, drawing his own detached security directly from that awareness. He gets called an enigma because he resembles a human being in a medium where people are used to seeing caricatures.</p>
<p>And all that is just a way of excusing the kinder, gentler Smog that has settled in on 2003's <i>Supper and now </i><i>A River Ain't Too Much to Love,</i> Callahan's 12th proper album. The more confrontational sound of early Smog-- the distinct instrumentation and the sometimes sardonic and sometimes nasty edge-- has been blunted, whether by age or simply a desire to not repeat himself. Instead, Callahan relies almost exclusively on acoustic strumming and easy melodies, forsaking much of the biting cynicism of his more highly regarded work. Although not as compelling as his more subversive material, this softening of his sound doesn't carry the negative connotation of an artist losing steam later in his career; Callahan's distinctive baritone and cutting inflection are unchanging and iconic, and show that this sensitive appearance is just one more spin of the kaleidoscope. As Callahan deadpans on ""I'm New Here"", ""I did not become someone different.../ No matter how far wrong you've gone/ You can always turn around.""</p>
<p>For the gentleness of its tone, a listen to ""Say Valley Maker"" makes clear the message here: ""Bury me in wood, and I will splinter/ Bury me in stone, and I will quake/ Bury me in water, and I will geyser/ Bury me in fire, and I'm gonna phoenix"". It's about transcendence after death, or-- for a man so clearly wrapped up in his own mortality in the past-- one of peace after the tumult of confronting that mortality. On previous records, after tossing a broken bottle into the woods-- frustrated because he couldn't work to open ""The Well""-- Callahan-as-Camus might've mused on the inconsequence or futility of the act. Here, he still throws the bottle, but suffers pangs of conscience, feeling sorry ""for the doe-paw, and the rabbit-paw,"" and goes looking for the shards.</p>
<p>Callahan's a bit new to this sort of territory, occasionally tripping over some surprisingly hokey imagery, and it may not suit those who crave the immediate emotional impact of his more tormented work. But, like any other Smog album, it would be incomplete if it pandered to a one-dimensional view of its creator. In that sense, <i>A River Ain't Too Much to Love </i>makes perfect sense. An album that might be superficially seen as inappropriately becalmed, in its own subdued way, feels instead like life welling up where it had once been suppressed, as human as anything Callahan has ever done.</p></div>"|7286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7286-a-river-aint-too-much-to-love/|7.7|Eric Carr

Don't worry about the fidelity, just hit ""record"" on your walkman or minicassette player, attach it to your pocket and we'll take care of the rest. Yes, I'm interested in what you get on tape. I really do want to hear how your refrigerator door sounds, and what's playing on television through the wall. The traffic outside is of particular interest, as is the conversation of whoever might be sitting nearby, or across the hall, or downstairs. When you have about thirty minutes, stop the tape, and send it to me. Don't worry, I'll take the best snippet, and immortalize your mundane vignette. In fact, ask a couple of your friends to do the same thing, and I'll make all of you stars. Avant-stars!</p><p>
    If this sounds like a waste of time, maybe you need some convincing. British experimental musician Chris Cutler (Henry Cow, Art Bears, Pere Ubu, head of ReR Records) has assembled some of the most interesting aural moments in the lives of other like-minded musicians. He did this for Out of the Blue Radio, a broadcast project funded by the London Musicians Coop from July 2002 to July 2003, using snippets of sound taken from all over the world. The only catch was, his contributors had to record their sound during the time the broadcast would air-- 11:30 pm to midnight, in whatever time zone the person lived. Cutler took the 30-minute records and aired them for the program, unaltered. Think of it as reality entertainment of a sort.</p><p>
    For <i>Twice Around the Earth</i>, Cutler went a step further, editing 43 of the recordings he received into short snippets, and arranged them chronologically into the lengthy title track. Additionally, the piece follows the contributors geographically, acting as a sound guide, literally twice around the world. On this CD, Cutler also includes his recording ""Lux"", taken from in the inside of a cafeteria, and ""Blue Winter"": Thirty-four more contributor recordings selected and arranged by Cutler and kindred spirit/engineer Bob Drake.</p><p>
    Since both ""Twice Around the Earth"" and ""Blue Winter"" feature dozens of short, physically disconnected segments of sound, you might expect a dizzying, disorienting experience. Far from it: the segments tend to dissolve into one another, and the overall effect is one of constantly shifting, but ever blending still life. The opening of the title track, the Blue Radio theme, replete with clock tower chimes, segues seamlessly into English composer John Scott's jogging along the Thames, which in turn transforms into David Lee Myers' Frog Lake, New York soundscape of, yes, frogs and crickets, moving right along to experimental sound design artist Thomas Dimuzio in San Francisco recording the noise outside his window, only to erupt in Hardy Fox's recording of piano at the Musee Mechanique, also in San Francisco. This is the pace of ""Twice Around the World"": technically breathless, but in practice, more like an ambient night train. The quieter moments (like Otomo Yoshihide's short Tokyo apartment recording, or the Hafler Trio's Andrew Mackenzie recording the Reykjavik air across the street from Björk's place) never seem far removed from the more boisterous ones (Jon Rose's overheard nightlife conversation in Australia, or the bizarre electronic noise of Haco and Christopher in Kobe, Japan), even when I know they're different in almost every way.</p><p>
    Cutler's ""Lux"" unfolds more naturally, with uninterrupted activity from a Luxembourg cafeteria. Yes, you get the quiet roar of people talking, the clang of dishes, the squeak of rubber souls on marble, a lone, repeated piano motif in the distance, unintelligible loudspeaker announcements-- practically a greatest hits of urban interior ambience. Background noise it may be, but as with any number of sparse, free improv records, its effectiveness is rooted in an unpredictability even when I ""know"" exactly what is happening. Of course, there will be people who deny this is music at all, but I'm not sure that's the point. Cutler's document suggests that when the sounds around us are so intrinsically interesting, there's no need to frame them with structure or artifice.</p></div>"|1809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1809-twice-around-the-earth/|7.7|Dominique Leone

On a great beat, the duo of Chris and Neef will sound great. On a terrible beat, they'll sound terrible. Both members have essentially the same flow: A prim, conversational mumble that usually turns sing-songy on the hooks. (Chris sounds slightly more gruff; Neef is slightly more nimble.) Their voices don't carry a hint of emotion or personality. They sound exactly the same rapping about guns as they do about girls, and neither one ever says anything remotely quotable.</p><p>
    
    And so <em>Brothers From Another doesn't really belong to either Chris or Neef. The album belongs instead to producer Chad ""Wes"" Hamilton, who turns in seven of the album's 12 tracks. Hamilton knows his way around a drum machine, and his tracks for </em><em>Brothers From Another have a slick, chilly electro pulse, like the skeletal booming drum machines of mid-80s Marley Marl with the rough edges polished off and replaced them with a glossy futuristic sheen. ""Don't Stop (YG Party)"" supports a rippling marimba loop with eerie, rolling bass tones.</em></p><p>
    
    ""It's the Life"" has a spare, empty shuffle and a ghostly, sustained synth wash. On the thug love ballad ""Don't Keep Me Waiting"" guests 112 coo like a prepubescent New Edition while Duran Duran cheese guitars and a popping slap bass swoop trough the track. The tracks that Hamilton didn't produce have the same lustrous throb. On his two tracks, for instance, Swizz Beats forgoes hype-man yelling and Jay-Z vocal samples for amazing swirling pianos on ""Beef"" and canned electro synths on lead single ""Set It Off"". The one glaring exception is the unbelievably obnoxious Kanye West pianos-and-string ballad ""Grown Man Pt. 2"", featuring one of Kanye's unbearable loverman verses and a hook with John Legend doing his best to impersonate the world's most generic lounge singer. </p><p>
    
    On Young Gunz' 2004 debut <em>Tough Luv, the duo was constantly overshadowed by infinitely more talented guests like Jay-Z and Beanie Sigel. The few guest rappers on </em><em>Brothers From Another (Daz, Memphis Bleek, Pooda Brown) fit the Gunners' personality vacuum. But with Hamiton's glittering, clanking tracks, personality is beside the point. Meet the rap robots of tomorrow.</em></p></div>"|8908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8908-brothers-from-another/|6.8|Tom Breihan

Think of that video circulating around the Internet with the painfully awkward prepubescent kid reenacting Star Wars lightsaber duels. Kidwell's first albums, and concerts, were chock-full of teenage panache, braggadocio, and shock value-- a combination that culminated on 2001's vitriolic yet playful <em>Oops, I Did It Again! Then bam, our cocksure Stars Wars kid gets a sudden bout of self-awareness as Kidwell tears out his playful IDM bells and whistles on 2003's misanthropic <i>Maryland Mansions</i>, replacing them with unapologetic electro scrapes, fractured beats and bitter cowls.</em></p><p>
    
    For such a conscientious and oftentimes self-deprecating album, it established Kidwell as a ""grown-up"" artist, and made haters feel pretty rotten for snickering at our Star War kid's previous works. No wonder Kidwell has little left to say on <em>Know Doubt, a recording about as polemic and intricate as a fart in church. Maybe melody isn't supposed to be the focus of this record, but apparently neither is rhythm, as <i>Know Doubt</i> kicks off with a potpourri of bleak, uninteresting sound effects on ""Every Extreme"" and closes similarly with ""S Opposite"", an unfledged take on M83.</em></p><p>
    
    Also surprising, in that predictably unpredictable Cex way, is Kidwell's vocal dissociation from his songs, a stark contrast to narcissistic <i>Maryland Mansion numbers like ""Kill Me"" and ""My Head"". Whether through distortion effects or equivocal lyrics, ambiguity surrounds Kidwell's voice. Even on ""Contains It""-- the EP's catchiest and most direct track-- overdubbed vocals and busy instrumentation dissemble Kidwell's desperate ""help me"" plea. ""State Secretly"" and ""Every Song Ever"" utilize the vocals as instruments, with the former centered around looping, paranoid phrases (""They're gonna find out!/ You're gonna have to leave!"") while the latter dices the lyrics into spasmodic segments unintelligibly bled into one another.</i></p><p>
    
    This relatively boring offering is salvaged, however, by Kidwell's proficiency behind the boards. While Cex the producer may hardly be as enticing as Cex the performer, <i>Know Doubt</i> would implode on self-importance and paucity if not for the occasional redemptive beat or synth swell. For a record consisting of so many discordant components, it's slapped together rather nicely. Maybe our freewheelin' Cex has worn out his outlandish, dicks-out shtick, but no amount of self-immolating records can erase the fact that Kidwell twists and turns knobs with the best of 'em. Hopefully what we're seeing here is a drawn-out but worthwhile reinvention of the Cex persona, and not a feckless search for a fabled, deeper Cex that's not there.</p></div>"|1393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1393-know-doubt-ep/|5.9|Adam Moerder

<p>Thirty years later Kraftwerk certainly have better machines,     and judging from the fantastic show they put in last week in     Washington D.C., they've been spending their time and energy     on everything but playing their instruments. The latter-day     Kraftwerk live experience is total theater, an intense     multimedia spectacle in which the nuts and bolts of who is     doing exactly what is not only impossible to determine but     completely irrelevant. So it is in a sense odd that     Kraftwerk has chosen this time to release their first officially     sanctioned live album. <i>Minimum-Maximum </i>is a collection of     performances recorded in the last couple years, sequenced to     closely reflect the set Kraftwerk are currently touring. Even     if <i>Minimum-Maximum</i> is essentially a mixed-down document of     whatever pre-recorded sounds the band loaded into the     production's computers, it's still an excellent record for three reasons:</p>
<p>1. The Sound<br/> I have Kraftwerk live bootlegs from 1971, 1975, 1981, and     1998, and the sound varies from horrid to passable.     <i>Minimum-Maximum</i>, however, is rich, balanced, and full,     reflecting the careful pre-show assembly while allowing     enough room reverb and crowd noise to let you know it's a     live recording. Far be it for Kraftwerk to let substandard     sonics soil anything born in the Kling-Klang studio.</p>
<p>2. The Arrangements<br/> While Kraftwerk do less physically live than they once did, their arrangements are constantly being     tweaked, so <i>Minimum-Maximum</i> never feels like a playback of     familiar records. One need only follow the evolution of     ""Autobahn"" from a trance-inducing jam in the mid-70s that     could last up to 40 minutes to the lean, effective     version here that seems pop song-length at just under nine     minutes. The vocal breakdown in ""Autobahn"" featuring layers     of robots harmonizing on the song's theme (first introduced     on The Mix) finds its way into this version, cementing the     song's connection with the Beach Boys.</p>
<p>Other shifts in focus are more subtle but still significant.     The vocodered vocals on the opening ""The Man Machine"" are     much more prominent, bursting forth from the speakers in a way     that seems to command a fully robotic future, even as the     songs backing music seems warmer and less harsh than the     album version. The beats for ""Trans-Europe Express"" and the     accompanying ""Metal on Metal"" are thicker and more     syncopated, putting the focus of Kraftwerk's railroad homage     squarely on the rhythm. The technofied songs from <i>Tour de     France Soundtracks</i> have not surprisingly changed the least     and, truthfully, ""Vitamin"" and ""Elektro Kardiogramm"" can't     quite match the classics that surround them.     Which leads us to the final reason <i>Minimum-Maximum</i> is worth     your time:</p>
<p>3. The Songs<br/> More than anything, <i>Minimum-Maximum</i> gets over because a     well-chosen selection from the Kraftwerk catalog is     basically unstoppable. The four-song <i>Computer World</i> run on     the second disc is particularly powerful, arguing for a     steady upward trajectory in Kraftwerk's output through 1981     and also showcasing their deadpan humor. ""It's more fun to     compute"" is the ultimate Kraftwerk line, a t-shirt slogan     that pokes fun at the 70s while articulating a pop-culture prescience. Indeed, the mood throughout the live show is     upbeat and celebratory-- ""Having a Party With Ralf and     Florian,"" if you will. The opening of ""Radioactivity"" is the     only truly heavy moment, with a robotic voice intoning disturbing statistics about plutonium, but     even here dance beats kick in roughly halfway through.</p>
<p>Since <i>Autobahn</i>, Kraftwerk have created music in which melody and rhythm become one,     and roughly two-thirds of the tracks here are perfect     examples of this precise, economical aesthetic. As a career     overview <i>Minimum-Maximum</i> far surpasses <i>The Mix</i>. This record's importance in the Kraftwerk story is up for debate, but     there's no question it's a hell of a lot of fun.</p></div>"|4557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4557-minimum-maximum/|9.0|Mark Richardson

It's not just that MacColl was killed in a mysterious scuba diving accident six years later, although that is incredibly tragic. Nor is it that she mentions death in every song, although that too is part of the album's sad new context. The bittersweetness of <i>Titanic Days</i> lies in the fact that in the 11 years since its release, MacColl's legacy hasn't really come to much: I'd be hard-pressed to think of any artist she has strongly and directly influenced (although I like to think that Neko Case has most of MacColl's albums on her shelf), and she has yet to be rediscovered by a new generation or to experience a resurgence of nostalgia for either her early output on Stiff Records or for later albums like <i>Kite</i> and <i>Electric Landlady</i>.</p><p>
    
    To American music fans she's perhaps most renowned for singing with the Pogues (""Fairytale of New York"" should be a holiday chestnut by now) and for her rendition of Cole Porter's ""Miss Otis Regrets"" on that quintessential 1990s benefit album, <em>Red Hot &amp; Blue</em>. To most people she's probably just a name they've read somewhere or remember only fleetingly.</p><p>
    
    But <em>Titanic Days is immanently memorable for its sense of humor and serious expectations. MacColl possessed a songwriting wit as sharp and as humorous as Elvis Costello's, but she was vulnerable and generous where he was often caustic, as if she just couldn't commit to being the curmudgeon. On the jazz-noirish ""Bad"", she spits verses about finally breaking free of her ""token woman"" existence: ""I want a brief encounter in a stolen car/ A hand on my buttock in a Spanish bar."" And the raucous pub-country rumbler ""Big Boy on a Saturday Night"" gleefully deflates the boasts of ""a silly pseudo lager lout with nothing much to shout about.""</em></p><p>
    
    The general consensus, however, is that <i>Titanic Days</i> is a divorce album, which isn't a stretch: both MacColl and collaborator Mark E. Nevin (who writes the reissue liner notes) were both enduring the ends of their marriages. That painful alienation informs almost every song here, but especially ""You Know It's You"", ""Don't Go Home"", and the title track, which ends in a cinematic coda of Technicolor strings that manages to be both melodramatic and utterly devastating. Remarkably there is no self-pitying animosity here, but plenty of adult resignation and the acknowledgement of indescribably messy emotions. ""And about all the pain,"" MacColl sings so defiantly on ""Tomorrow Never Comes"", ""Well, you know it was worth it/You could do it again/ But I just don't deserve it.""</p><p>
    
    Despite the somewhat dated production, <em>Titanic Days manages to sound both dreamily optimistic and realistically down-to-earth, measuring the distance between the hoped-for life and the lived existence. Songs like ""Soho Square"" and ""Angel"" are shot through with a anticipation for something enormous and life-changing, whether good or bad-- something, as the title proclaims, titanic. MacColl has the perfect voice for this expectancy: It's light but never ethereal, grounded but never guttural. She remains permanently rooted in the here and now, but sounds like she won't settle for that.</em></p><p>
    
    This reissue adds to the album a second disk of twelve bonus tracks, all of which are either contemporaneous recordings or session outtakes. In addition to two b-sides, two live cuts, and three demos, there are four versions of the first single ""Angel"", which seems like overkill. The Into the Light and Apollo 440 remixes reinvent the song dramatically, but to little effect, while the relatively stripped down Piano Mix nearly bests Lillywhite's album version.</p><p>
<em>Titanic Days, unfortunately, was not the big thing MacColl was waiting for. Upon its release, the album received modest praise and disappointing sales. It took MacColl six years to release a follow-up, </em><em>Tropical Brainstorm, which produced a minor posthumous hit with ""In These Shoes?"" In the meantime, </em><em>Titanic Days went out of print and became a sought-after rarity among serious fans and critics-- a situation now remedied by this reissue, even if it doesn't really constitute a happy ending.</em></p></div>"|5015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5015-titanic-days/|8.2|Stephen M.

But hey, that'd be too easy; instead, <i>Cuts Across the Land is an album brimming with the piss and vinegar expected from a band toiling-- until recently-- fruitlessly in the British music scene since 2002. Of course, that sort of elbow grease is required when you're aiming to usurp the femme-blues throne currently occupied by PJ Harvey and newbies the Kills and Yeah Yeah Yeahs.</i></p><p>
    
    Duke Spirit singer Leila Moss possess the scowl of Karen O, with a haunting, reserved quality that, at its darkest, is reminiscent of Kim Gordon. ""Darling You're Mean"" at first lulls listeners with a pacific guitar pattern and breathy vocals before launching into a menacing, dissonant chorus. ""Oooh no, yeah it's comin' back/ And I say oooh, Jesus Christ, yeah it's drivin' me mad"" wails Moss with enough unnerving frankness to frighten even the most petulant, chauvinist male blues singer.</p><p>
    
    Instrumentally, <i>Cuts Across the Land loses some steam from the band's cataclysmic yet cogent live performance. Still, that doesn't prevent singles ""Love Is an Unfamiliar Name"" and ""Cuts Across the Land"" from staking their claim in 2005's indie honor roll. The former rides an ascending guitar riff until Moss's heartbreak boils over into a flurry of piqued ""Oh-oh-oh's"". The title track taps the Jesus and Mary Chain mentality of repeating a basic chord progression until it sounds revolutionary-- and a clamoring, Sonic Youth-inspired breakdown two-thirds through serves as a dead-on extension of Moss's scoffing persona.</i></p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the album's murky mix reveals a few songwriting bugs, particularly on slower-paced tracks. Despite the blemishes, <i>Cuts Across the Land is a surprisingly galvanized and consistent offering from a band that has hardly registered a blip on most British, let alone American, radar screens-- an inverse Coldplay of sorts. Score one for the underdog.</i></p></div>"|2613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2613-cuts-across-the-land/|7.4|Adam Moerder

    think of Prefuse 73, Four Tet, Caribou, and Nobody as a tightly-knit
    bunch of like-minded innovators that cherry-pick the past in order to
    advance the future of brain-bubbling beatmaking. I also like
    to think they often argue over whose oh-so-mysterious alias is the
    coolest (""It's, like, before 'fuse,' man. Way before.""). And since all
    four members of this elite class have recently graduated from indie
    darlings to veteran indie darlings, the time is ripe to dole out some
    milestone-marking superlatives.</p><p>
    
    Best Dressed, of course, goes to Prefuse and the tinted Onassis
    sunglasses that nearly overshadowed the lackluster material from this
    year's <i>Surrounded By Silence</i> at recent shows. Caribou gets Most
    Spirited for his tenacious drumming and overall sense of overflowing
    sonic enthusiasm. By consistently violating the instrumental-dude ""no
    smiling"" rule on his album covers and press photos, Four Tet takes
    Friendliest. Which leaves us with Nobody aka Elvin Estela, the
    shadowy, hairy member of the de facto troupe. With his first album for
    L.A.-based label Plug Research (Daedelus, Dntel), the Calm, Cool &amp;
    Collected recipient combines the varying textures of his jazzy debut
    LP <em>Soulmates and its superior psych-infused follow-up <i>Pacific Drift:
    Western Water Music Vol. 1</i>, surfacing with a canny mix of West Coast
    indie-hop beats and hazy, flowing aural hallucinations.</em></p><p>
    
    The album's seemingly defeatist title matches Estela's similarly
    downtrodden moniker, but <em>And Everything Else...</em> is anything but a
    rainy-day collection of odds 'n' sods. Best experienced with the sun
    beating down, the taught 12 tracks mark the
    producer's most diverse and song-based work yet. The trippy,
    shimmering tone is established by opener ""The Coast Is Clear (For
    Fireworks)"", which rides a smooth-knocking shuffle along the
    California shoreline as wafts of blurry, delayed guitars, cheery keys
    and charming firework noises pop and burst in the distance. A tame,
    organ-heavy cover of the Flaming Lips' <i>The Soft Bulletin</i> ballad ""What Is
    the Light?"" featuring members of Beachwood Sparks on vocals follows,
    but its lethargic pace and surprising lack of experimentation render
    it a boring and predictable lowlight.</p><p>
    
    Most of the record's collaborations hit their mark though, like the
    Mia Toi Dodd assisted ""You Can Know Her"", a sparkling lullaby that
    uses the singer's lofty, sea-nymph delivery to stunning effect. ""Tori
    Oshi"" is the second collaboration between Estela and Scott Heren under
    their La Correccion banner and it's a nimble, finger-picking
    electro-folk jaunt; it serves as a welcome contrast to the plodding
    ""La Correccion Exchange"" featured on Prefuse's <em>Surrounded by Silence.</em></p><p>
    
    Even on the record's more hopped-up songs like the wind-up toy bumping
    ""Wake Up and Smell the Millennium"", Estela is still playing the
    effortless host to his own infinite California-daze slumber party. Nobody offers grooves that won't interfere with your daily routine as
    much as enhance it from the outside in, sneakily setting a distinct
    mood without really trying. Then, before you can even ask him to sign
    your yearbook, he's disappeared into the hot-pavement fog.</p></div>"|5914.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5914-and-everything-else/|7.1|Ryan Dombal

There's some flexibility to the
    idiom-- it can be light and aerodynamic or titanically heavy; quick
    and nimble or unapologetically slothful; deadly efficient or clumsily
    longwinded-- but one thing is sure: There's no opposing force it
    cannot withstand. If the carnival strongman can bend you over his
    shoulders, you've failed.</p><p>
    For their part, Early Man fail robustly on their new self-titled EP. Rife with blunders both technical and tactical,
    the album dumbfounds more than it offends. The band aren't inept, but
    trying to nail <i>Reign in Blood</i> kicks without razor-sharp chops is
    fatuous. Taking on the metal demigods, Early Man are like a squad of
    college doughboys come to contend against Schwarzenegger for Mr.
    Universe '73. The band is manhandled by their own poorly-executed
    songs.</p><p>
    Sloppiness is part and parcel of the stoner metal appellation, but
    Early Man don't fester in reverb-saturated mud-pits of their
    imprecision; they chug, stomp, wiggle and kick the way a more
    technically proficient outfit might, only seldom hitting their target.
    Word is, <i>Early Man was hastily recorded on free studio time and
    intended just as a promotional tool for the undiscovered duo. In that
    case, it's easier to forgive the flaccid recording, which sounds
    pounded into a squishy pâté. Metal comes served many ways, but spread
    on crackers is not a preferred method.</i></p><p>
    Delivered in a studied Hetfieldian croon, Mike Conte's vocals are
    deliberately dumb and devoid of imagination. As a beer-sodden
    brawler's anthem, ""Fight!"" is successful: it couldn't be more
    retarded. ""Alright, so you wanna fight,"" Conte sings, ""My fists are
    sticks of dynamite/ Fuck you if you're talking to <em>may</em>/ My
    fuse blows quick like T-N-T<em>ay</em>!"" At least give us the Angel of
    Death, or something remotely visceral. Fortunately, Conte's verses on
    ""The Undertaker Is Calling You"" are warped beyond recognition-- the
    sound is much more convincing than the meaning.</p><p>
    Early Man are disagreeably contrived, ripping from metal legends past
    and present with sufficient accuracy but little reverence. (I thought
    I caught a whiff of parody, although now I'm pretty sure the band are
    entirely sincere.) ""Death Is the Answer to My Prayers"" is a
    Sabbath-style dirge, complete with plenty of stupid-fun quarter-note
    bashing and a demonically crooked vocal delivery. But as with this
    perfunctory teaser's other two tracks, Early Man can rock so much
    harder. Here's hoping their new label, Matador, finds these boys a
    fancy engineer who'll sharpen the blades and give their words
    someplace to hide. Such a fine-tuning might not flip that rating, but
    it would give the band's broken-bottle narratives some heft.</p></div>"|2927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2927-early-man-ep/|3.9|Sam Ubl

    with an average rating of about 3.3: Here's a man's entire career
    boiled down to ""Definitely below average, but a few redeeming
    qualities."" You might argue that Weezer's <em>Make Believe</em> drew a
    0.4 just for sharing a name with a Kinsella project, although sucking
    mightily probably had something to do with it. I've always found Joan
    of Arc's artified emo shockfests to be insufferable, but today, the
    Devil is ordering a personalized Make Believe Neighborhoodie to fend
    off a sudden cold snap: I'm dropping some Forkian love on Kinsella.
    Schreiber's gonna hate me (Ryan, did I ever tell you that I regard you
    as the Lewis Lapham of indie?).</p><p>
    
    What's interesting is that Make Believe's debut EP isn't even a
    deviation from Kinsella's usual noodle-rock screamifying-- the band
    is essentially Joan of Arc playing non-JOA songs-- it's simply a
    streamlined, rawked out version of the same. If there's nothing here a
    Joan of Arc fan wouldn't recognize as Kinsella fare, there's also
    surprisingly little that would lead a gimlet-eyed hipster to make the
    international sign for ""gag me with a spoon."" Take opening track
    ""We're All Going to Die"". The lyrics are aiming high, and Kinsellas,
    ever the postmodernist, manages to sustain his truism and tautology
    laden screed on the denaturing of language for the duration.</p><p>
    
    But screw the lyrics; the guitar sound is out of this world. ""We're
    All Going to Die"" is comprised of squelchy knots of squealing melody,
    and sounds like it was written forwards, played backwards and recorded
    forwards again. The off-kilter drums and intensely prickly guitars are
    connected by slick, simmering bridges; it all comes off as
    psychedelic, proggy, or mathy depending on your age and tastes, but
    I've got to point out that if there's such a thing as post-screamo,
    this is it. Same goes for ""Britt's Favorite"", which opens with warm,
    splintering arpeggios that gradually cohere into a fizzy 4/4 stomp.
    These are the highest highs, and a whole EP this focused might have
    earned Kinsella a previously unthinkable 7.0. The other three tracks
    are more piecemeal, and while the parts that work are potent, the ones
    that don't are a little too JOA for comfort. But overall, this is a
    solid fifteen-minute thrill ride from a dude I thought was only
    capable of Willy Wonka-style terror cruises.</p></div>"|5649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5649-make-believe/|6.0|Brian Howe

That's obvious, but it doesn't go far enough.     Most rock these days also tends to be slavishly monochromatic,     whatever its template-- all the easier to file under nu-wave,     nu-metal, post-rock, prog-rock, roots-rock, frat-rock, pop-punk,     power-pop, hardcore, emo, screamo, post-screamo, or Gwyneth Paltrow-humping     Radiohead-lite. Rare is the act that actually pulls together disparate     threads for a sound that visits more than one or two of contemporary     rock's Intarweb-abetted ghettoes.</p>
<p>Wales' Super Furry Animals are such a band. Like anyone, these     multilingual electro-psych-glam-pop/rock pranksters have influences,     amply documented on their 2005 <i>Under the Influence</i> comp:     post-<i>Pet Sounds</i> Beach Boys, Electric Light Orchestra, the MC5,     Underworld, Joey Beltram and...opera? Well, maybe. The difference is     that SFA borrow their heroes' doggedly original aesthetic values as     much as their easy sonic trademarks. Together, singer Gruff Rhys,     guitarist Huw ""Bunf"" Bunford, bassist Guto Pryce, keyboardist Cian     Ciárán, and drummer Dafydd Ieuan have crafted six anarchically     experimental albums. Their label recently saw fit to reissue four of     them, with bonus tracks, plus odds-and-sods comp <i>Out Spaced</i>.</p>
<p>1996's <i>Fuzzy Logic</i> introduced the world to the Super Furries'     candy-factory chameleon act. Opener ""God! Show Me Magic"" wastes no     time, kicking off practically mid-riff to the type of synth-laced     punk-pop Supergrass or even Oasis fans could probably understand. The     album's most infectious sing-along, ""Something 4 the Weekend"",     appears here in a more rambunctious take than on the near-perfect     single version. The album's lyrics span hamsters, ""soul transplants,""     UFOs, village idiots, and ""Hometown Unicorn"" (a more psychedelic take     on Blur's ""This Is a Low""). The woozy <i>Pipers</i>-era Floyd of     ""Gathering Moss"" swells into the poignant strings of ""If You Don't     Want Me to Destroy You"". The latter half of the record is less     consistent, but the slanted pop of ""Mario Man"" and the hazy ""Long     Gone"" are still inimitably, idiosyncratically SFA.</p>
<p>A year later, <i>Radiator</i> saw the band beginning to master the art     of the album. The song structure and production continue to increase     in complexity-- encompassing piano-ballad melancholia,     self-destructing folktronica, Bowie art-rock, and the punk urgency of     the Jam or Buzzcocks-- but the sun-kissed '60s pop hooks remain as     accessible as ever. Rhys's seeming joy in his own strangeness stirs     sugar into the album's chemical cocktail, rendering songs about     goat-sucking vampires, Marie Curie, and military coups in Sierra Leone     surprisingly easy to swallow. Many would rank this as the band's     finest album.</p>
<p>But that's <i>Guerrilla</i>. From the single-worthy supermarket psych     of hidden pre-opening track ""Citizens Band"" to the long-delayed     cymbal crash of brief final hidden track ""Chewing Chewing Gum     (Reprise)"", 1999's <i>Guerrilla</i> takes the group's long-standing     whimsicality to its logic-warping extreme. In their earliest days, SFA     formed as a techno group, and <i>Guerrilla</i> sees those impulses     merging with the band's previous sunny guitar-pop. Here the group do     seemingly everything, and well: near-perfect sunny pop (""Do or Die""),     soaring Brit balladry that makes slow service a kind of apotheosis     (""Turning Tide""), horn-laden tropicalia (""Northern Lites""),     floor-slapping LSD-infused electronica (""Wherever I Lay My Phone""),     hula-dancing drum-and-bass (""The Door to This House Remains Open"") and     country endearments (""Fire in My Heart""). The album's many gags and     eccentricities, like opener ""Check It Out"" or the 22-second     oddity of ""The Sound of Life Today"", give it the playful feel of a     hip-hop record, with its requisite skits. <i>Guerrilla</i> is an     alternate universe to get lost in.</p>
<p>Between <i>Radiator</i> and <i>Guerrilla</i>, the Super Furries     released <i>Out Spaced</i>, which culls together <i>Fuzzy Logic</i> B-sides and tracks from their earliest EPs. Like UK contemporaries     Oasis, Blur, or Radiohead, SFA boast plenty of non-album tracks that     stand up to their strongest material. <i>Out Spaced</i> is, along with later     singles comp <i>Songbook</i>, sequenced as an album rather than chronologically, and leads     with riotously profane Steely Dan-sampling single ""The Man Don't Give     a Fuck"". Two tracks later, the vaguely danceable ""Smokin'"" has a     similarly repetitive, unwholesome tagline: ""I just want to smoke it.""     ""Don't Be a Fool, Billy"" could sit comfortably beside any of the     band's up-tempo songs, while ""Carry the Can"" is a good-naturedly     bombastic ballad the likes of ""Turning Tide"" or ""It's Not the End of     the World"". A few of the songs are in Welsh, such as the strangely     compelling 11-minute closing track, spell-check-defying     ""'Blewytirhwng?"", but everything the Super Furries do could be in     another language.</p>
<p>Especially when, as on ""Blewytirhwng?"" (thanks, copy-and-paste!), it's     actually in another language. Like, what'd I say, Welsh? SFA recorded     2000's largely acoustic <i>Mwng</i> entirely in that ancient Brithonic     tongue, and it's-- startlingly-- as easy to enjoy as their English     works. Single ""Ysbeidiau Heulog"", which predicted the wooly-bully     ? and the Mysterians garage rock of bands like the Caesars, is the     standout, but sinuous pop melodies and organic arrangements that do     more with less than the band's usual studio wizardry make for an     exciting discovery almost all the way through. The chutes-and-ladders     chorus of ""Ymaelodi â'r Ymylon"" is a particular favorite.</p>
<p>So yeah, like I mentioned earlier, these reissues include some bonus     tracks, too. As is generally the case with lost B-sides, they're     really just for hardcore fans. But many of those listeners will be     overjoyed to discover songs that somehow missed the <i>Out Spaced</i> cut: perky, <i>Spinal Tap</i>-referencing ""Waiting to Happen"" from the     extended <i>Fuzzy Logic</i>; Syd Barrett-esque alphabet song ""No K"",     optimistic Jurassic space-rocker ""Hit and Run"", and bright classic     ""Wrap It Up"" (""They call me the dealer/ I mean I deals in ideals"")     from <i>Radiator</i>. <i>Guerrilla</i>'s offerings pale beside the     original album, but do manage to scratch the itch for more SFA: shiny,     distorted mid-tempo number ""This, That and the Other"", piano-accented     bounder ""Missunderstanding (sic), and the inescapably sha-la-la-ing     ""Colorblind"". <i>Mwng</i> comes with a bonus disc, but it's the same     one North American listeners got upon its initial release, featuring     ""Sali Mali"" and ""Calimero"".</p>
<p>Where does this leave the Super Furries' legacy? Newbies should     probably still start with the just-out singles compilation,     <i>Songbook</i>. Then, despite getting short shrift in some circles,     2001 major-label debut <i>Rings Around the World</i> is the next entry     point, adhering to the catch-all <i>Guerrilla</i> template and tossing     in some of the group's catchiest, most accessible songs in the     bargain. But notice all those 8's up there: The Super Furries have     recorded so much great music, but their limitless sonic adventurism     has never yielded an album that was completely unassailable-- even     <i>Guerrilla</i>. Maybe that's too much to expect, or contrary to the     band's don't-give-a-fuck vision. Surely the Perfect Album rock ideal     isn't ""retro""? In the wake of 2003's disappointing <i>Phantom     Power</i>, some of us still hold out hope.

That's obvious, but it doesn't go far enough.     Most rock these days also tends to be slavishly monochromatic,     whatever its template-- all the easier to file under nu-wave,     nu-metal, post-rock, prog-rock, roots-rock, frat-rock, pop-punk,     power-pop, hardcore, emo, screamo, post-screamo, or Gwyneth Paltrow-humping     Radiohead-lite. Rare is the act that actually pulls together disparate     threads for a sound that visits more than one or two of contemporary     rock's Intarweb-abetted ghettoes.</p>
<p>Wales' Super Furry Animals are such a band. Like anyone, these     multilingual electro-psych-glam-pop/rock pranksters have influences,     amply documented on their 2005 <i>Under the Influence</i> comp:     post-<i>Pet Sounds</i> Beach Boys, Electric Light Orchestra, the MC5,     Underworld, Joey Beltram and...opera? Well, maybe. The difference is     that SFA borrow their heroes' doggedly original aesthetic values as     much as their easy sonic trademarks. Together, singer Gruff Rhys,     guitarist Huw ""Bunf"" Bunford, bassist Guto Pryce, keyboardist Cian     Ciárán, and drummer Dafydd Ieuan have crafted six anarchically     experimental albums. Their label recently saw fit to reissue four of     them, with bonus tracks, plus odds-and-sods comp <i>Out Spaced</i>.</p>
<p>1996's <i>Fuzzy Logic</i> introduced the world to the Super Furries'     candy-factory chameleon act. Opener ""God! Show Me Magic"" wastes no     time, kicking off practically mid-riff to the type of synth-laced     punk-pop Supergrass or even Oasis fans could probably understand. The     album's most infectious sing-along, ""Something 4 the Weekend"",     appears here in a more rambunctious take than on the near-perfect     single version. The album's lyrics span hamsters, ""soul transplants,""     UFOs, village idiots, and ""Hometown Unicorn"" (a more psychedelic take     on Blur's ""This Is a Low""). The woozy <i>Pipers</i>-era Floyd of     ""Gathering Moss"" swells into the poignant strings of ""If You Don't     Want Me to Destroy You"". The latter half of the record is less     consistent, but the slanted pop of ""Mario Man"" and the hazy ""Long     Gone"" are still inimitably, idiosyncratically SFA.</p>
<p>A year later, <i>Radiator</i> saw the band beginning to master the art     of the album. The song structure and production continue to increase     in complexity-- encompassing piano-ballad melancholia,     self-destructing folktronica, Bowie art-rock, and the punk urgency of     the Jam or Buzzcocks-- but the sun-kissed '60s pop hooks remain as     accessible as ever. Rhys's seeming joy in his own strangeness stirs     sugar into the album's chemical cocktail, rendering songs about     goat-sucking vampires, Marie Curie, and military coups in Sierra Leone     surprisingly easy to swallow. Many would rank this as the band's     finest album.</p>
<p>But that's <i>Guerrilla</i>. From the single-worthy supermarket psych     of hidden pre-opening track ""Citizens Band"" to the long-delayed     cymbal crash of brief final hidden track ""Chewing Chewing Gum     (Reprise)"", 1999's <i>Guerrilla</i> takes the group's long-standing     whimsicality to its logic-warping extreme. In their earliest days, SFA     formed as a techno group, and <i>Guerrilla</i> sees those impulses     merging with the band's previous sunny guitar-pop. Here the group do     seemingly everything, and well: near-perfect sunny pop (""Do or Die""),     soaring Brit balladry that makes slow service a kind of apotheosis     (""Turning Tide""), horn-laden tropicalia (""Northern Lites""),     floor-slapping LSD-infused electronica (""Wherever I Lay My Phone""),     hula-dancing drum-and-bass (""The Door to This House Remains Open"") and     country endearments (""Fire in My Heart"").

Like UK contemporaries     Oasis, Blur, or Radiohead, SFA boast plenty of non-album tracks that     stand up to their strongest material. <i>Out Spaced</i> is, along with later     singles comp <i>Songbook</i>, sequenced as an album rather than chronologically, and leads     with riotously profane Steely Dan-sampling single ""The Man Don't Give     a Fuck"". Two tracks later, the vaguely danceable ""Smokin'"" has a     similarly repetitive, unwholesome tagline: ""I just want to smoke it.""     ""Don't Be a Fool, Billy"" could sit comfortably beside any of the     band's up-tempo songs, while ""Carry the Can"" is a good-naturedly     bombastic ballad the likes of ""Turning Tide"" or ""It's Not the End of     the World"". A few of the songs are in Welsh, such as the strangely     compelling 11-minute closing track, spell-check-defying     ""'Blewytirhwng?"", but everything the Super Furries do could be in     another language.</p>
<p>Especially when, as on ""Blewytirhwng?"" (thanks, copy-and-paste!), it's     actually in another language. Like, what'd I say, Welsh? SFA recorded     2000's largely acoustic <i>Mwng</i> entirely in that ancient Brithonic     tongue, and it's-- startlingly-- as easy to enjoy as their English     works. Single ""Ysbeidiau Heulog"", which predicted the wooly-bully     ? and the Mysterians garage rock of bands like the Caesars, is the     standout, but sinuous pop melodies and organic arrangements that do     more with less than the band's usual studio wizardry make for an     exciting discovery almost all the way through. The chutes-and-ladders     chorus of ""Ymaelodi â'r Ymylon"" is a particular favorite.</p>
<p>So yeah, like I mentioned earlier, these reissues include some bonus     tracks, too. As is generally the case with lost B-sides, they're     really just for hardcore fans. But many of those listeners will be     overjoyed to discover songs that somehow missed the <i>Out Spaced</i> cut: perky, <i>Spinal Tap</i>-referencing ""Waiting to Happen"" from the     extended <i>Fuzzy Logic</i>; Syd Barrett-esque alphabet song ""No K"",     optimistic Jurassic space-rocker ""Hit and Run"", and bright classic     ""Wrap It Up"" (""They call me the dealer/ I mean I deals in ideals"")     from <i>Radiator</i>. <i>Guerrilla</i>'s offerings pale beside the     original album, but do manage to scratch the itch for more SFA: shiny,     distorted mid-tempo number ""This, That and the Other"", piano-accented     bounder ""Missunderstanding (sic), and the inescapably sha-la-la-ing     ""Colorblind"". <i>Mwng</i> comes with a bonus disc, but it's the same     one North American listeners got upon its initial release, featuring     ""Sali Mali"" and ""Calimero"".</p>
<p>Where does this leave the Super Furries' legacy? Newbies should     probably still start with the just-out singles compilation,     <i>Songbook</i>. Then, despite getting short shrift in some circles,     2001 major-label debut <i>Rings Around the World</i> is the next entry     point, adhering to the catch-all <i>Guerrilla</i> template and tossing     in some of the group's catchiest, most accessible songs in the     bargain. But notice all those 8's up there: The Super Furries have     recorded so much great music, but their limitless sonic adventurism     has never yielded an album that was completely unassailable-- even     <i>Guerrilla</i>. Maybe that's too much to expect, or contrary to the     band's don't-give-a-fuck vision. Surely the Perfect Album rock ideal     isn't ""retro""? In the wake of 2003's disappointing <i>Phantom     Power</i>, some of us still hold out hope.

That's obvious, but it doesn't go far enough.     Most rock these days also tends to be slavishly monochromatic,     whatever its template-- all the easier to file under nu-wave,     nu-metal, post-rock, prog-rock, roots-rock, frat-rock, pop-punk,     power-pop, hardcore, emo, screamo, post-screamo, or Gwyneth Paltrow-humping     Radiohead-lite. Rare is the act that actually pulls together disparate     threads for a sound that visits more than one or two of contemporary     rock's Intarweb-abetted ghettoes.</p>
<p>Wales' Super Furry Animals are such a band. Like anyone, these     multilingual electro-psych-glam-pop/rock pranksters have influences,     amply documented on their 2005 <i>Under the Influence</i> comp:     post-<i>Pet Sounds</i> Beach Boys, Electric Light Orchestra, the MC5,     Underworld, Joey Beltram and...opera? Well, maybe. The difference is     that SFA borrow their heroes' doggedly original aesthetic values as     much as their easy sonic trademarks. Together, singer Gruff Rhys,     guitarist Huw ""Bunf"" Bunford, bassist Guto Pryce, keyboardist Cian     Ciárán, and drummer Dafydd Ieuan have crafted six anarchically     experimental albums. Their label recently saw fit to reissue four of     them, with bonus tracks, plus odds-and-sods comp <i>Out Spaced</i>.</p>
<p>1996's <i>Fuzzy Logic</i> introduced the world to the Super Furries'     candy-factory chameleon act. Opener ""God! Show Me Magic"" wastes no     time, kicking off practically mid-riff to the type of synth-laced     punk-pop Supergrass or even Oasis fans could probably understand. The     album's most infectious sing-along, ""Something 4 the Weekend"",     appears here in a more rambunctious take than on the near-perfect     single version. The album's lyrics span hamsters, ""soul transplants,""     UFOs, village idiots, and ""Hometown Unicorn"" (a more psychedelic take     on Blur's ""This Is a Low""). The woozy <i>Pipers</i>-era Floyd of     ""Gathering Moss"" swells into the poignant strings of ""If You Don't     Want Me to Destroy You"". The latter half of the record is less     consistent, but the slanted pop of ""Mario Man"" and the hazy ""Long     Gone"" are still inimitably, idiosyncratically SFA.</p>
<p>A year later, <i>Radiator</i> saw the band beginning to master the art     of the album. The song structure and production continue to increase     in complexity-- encompassing piano-ballad melancholia,     self-destructing folktronica, Bowie art-rock, and the punk urgency of     the Jam or Buzzcocks-- but the sun-kissed '60s pop hooks remain as     accessible as ever. Rhys's seeming joy in his own strangeness stirs     sugar into the album's chemical cocktail, rendering songs about     goat-sucking vampires, Marie Curie, and military coups in Sierra Leone     surprisingly easy to swallow. Many would rank this as the band's     finest album.</p>
<p>But that's <i>Guerrilla</i>. From the single-worthy supermarket psych     of hidden pre-opening track ""Citizens Band"" to the long-delayed     cymbal crash of brief final hidden track ""Chewing Chewing Gum     (Reprise)"", 1999's <i>Guerrilla</i> takes the group's long-standing     whimsicality to its logic-warping extreme. In their earliest days, SFA     formed as a techno group, and <i>Guerrilla</i> sees those impulses     merging with the band's previous sunny guitar-pop. Here the group do     seemingly everything, and well: near-perfect sunny pop (""Do or Die""),     soaring Brit balladry that makes slow service a kind of apotheosis     (""Turning Tide""), horn-laden tropicalia (""Northern Lites""),     floor-slapping LSD-infused electronica (""Wherever I Lay My Phone""),     hula-dancing drum-and-bass (""The Door to This House Remains Open"") and     country endearments (""Fire in My Heart""). The album's many gags and     eccentricities, like opener ""Check It Out"" or the 22-second     oddity of ""The Sound of Life Today"", give it the playful feel of a     hip-hop record, with its requisite skits. <i>Guerrilla</i> is an     alternate universe to get lost in.</p>

    Guide to the Galaxy novels.  Two albums later, it seems they chose the wrong Adams catchphrase; most of their recorded output
    is better exemplified by the Guide's description of Earth: ""Mostly harmless.""  In their seven years together, Coldplay have risen
    to monumental levels of popularity on a potent mixture of nice-guy charm, serviceable songwriting, and general inoffensiveness.
    Unfortunately, these aren't the kind of traits that often lead to interesting music.  Not that the band hasn't taken the occasional
    stabs at creativity and innovation; it's just that those attempts have always been carefully measured, or even nervously
    self-conscious.</em></p><p>
    
    Coldplay have never seemed intent on world domination, but as their early singles caught on, journalists came waving raves.  Then,
    with nearly 5 million copies of <i>Parachutes</i> sold worldwide and their popularity on the upswing, the band's sophomore album,
    <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i>, found the band unsure of how to advance.  Luckily for them, their decision to virtually recreate
    <i>Parachutes</i> on a larger budget paid off commercially: The album got them tagged as ""the next U2,"" a ridiculously off-base
    coronation that ignores the fact that U2 recorded ""I Will Follow"", ""New Year's Day"", ""Bad"", and <i>The Joshua Tree</i>, among others,
    before <i>they</i> wandered off into the MOR wilderness.</p><p>
    
    Coldplay, meanwhile, started in the middle of the road and haven't strayed since.  Granted, they've produced a handful of good
    songs-- ""Don't Panic"", ""Shiver"", and ""The Scientist"" are all fine achievements, while ""Clocks"" remains a great piano part in search
    of an equally great melody-- but their albums have yet to justify the critical hyperbole, and their third full-length, <em>X&amp;Y;</em>,
    isn't going to be the one to lock that down.  Though dressed to the nines in big guitars and faultless musicianship, <i>X&amp;Y;</i> is
    unable to lay claim to even a single song equal to any of the high points from their first two albums, and the band's obvious desire
    to be all things to all people doesn't help: They long to be huge and expansive, in <i>The Unforgettable Fire</i> mode (""A Message""),
    tear-jerking AOR balladeers (""Fix You""), and hip, Kraftwerk-referencing aesthetes (""Talk""), but at heart, they're really built for
    easy listening, which makes their rockers feel cursory and their ballads simpering.</p><p>
<i>X&amp;Y;</i> is sequenced fast-song/slow-song through almost its entire running order, which means those of you uninterested in wading
    through doe-eyed love songs based on lazy rhyming couplets and trite resolutions have already lost half a disc's worth of music.
    You'll ""go backwards and then/ You'll go forwards again.""  You'll ""get lost and then get found.""  You'll notice that the first verse
    of ""Swallowed in the Sea"" (""You cut me down a tree/ And brought it back to me/ And that's what made me see/ Where I was coming from"")
    is somehow meaningless, yet also cliched.  Had Coldplay accompanied these lyrics with remotely interesting or memorable music, this
    could be somewhat overlooked; sadly, ""Swallowed in the Sea"" is one of several <i>aggressively</i> banal ballads that sink this album
    into a sort of neo-Carpenters abyss.</p><p>
    
    The more uptempo tracks here tend to be light years better than their leaden counterparts, if only because the louder accompaniment
    manages to drown out more of Chris Martin's lyrics and bring the focus to his pleasant if unspectacular vocals.  Guitarist John
    Buckland does his part to bring life to the proceedings: He's an encyclopedia of Will Sergeant and Johnny Marr-isms, and even if
    most of his window dressings are little more than a distillation of tricks learned from better bands, he does a nice job of providing
    the illusion of a grand gesture for songs like ""Square One"" and ""White Shadows"".  Martin's vocals, meanwhile, rarely command attention,
    content to melt into the string synthesizer and guitar reverb as if he hopes he's not imposing on you.  Listening back to an earlier
    track like ""Shiver"" proves he's capable of more.</p><p>
    
    Lending to the uninspired nature is lead single ""Speed of Sound""'s uncanny resemblance to ""Clocks"".  Certainly, it rarely hurts to
    stick with what works, but this is not just a near-exact replica of its successful predecessor; it's also a less memorable song
    riding a piano hook that has so deeply infiltrated the pop-culture landscape that I've become numb to it.  In fairness, the track's
    vocal melody outperforms the one from ""Clocks"" by a hair, but without a strong hook, the song fails in the one category it needs to
    succeed in: replay value.  It's symptomatic of the rest of the album, and indeed, much of the band's catalog to date: Like Coldplay's
    two previous albums, only more so, <i>X&amp;Y;</i> is bland but never offensive, listenable but not memorable.  It may be pointless to
    hate them, but with this album, they've almost certainly become the easiest band on the planet to be completely indifferent to.</p></div>"|1541.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1541-xy/|4.9|Joe Tangari

Jandek has been prolific since his 1978 debut <i>Ready for the House</i>, but in the wake of Chad Friedrich's well-received 2003 documentary <i>Jandek on Corwood</i> the singer has ramped up his production, releasing four new albums in 2004 and two already in 2005.</p><p>
    
    Most startling of all, however, has been Jandek's recent series of three (so far) live performances in Scotland and England, the first-known such concerts of his career. These appearances have sent almost literal shockwaves through his fervent fan community; the live dates serving to radically demystify the man and his abstruse, fascinating music. Though much about him remains cloaked in mystery, these live performances have put some of the more outlandish theories about his work (""He died in Vietnam, and his family is putting the records out as they can afford it"") to rest, while simultaneously sending the strong signal that Jandek remains now what he always has been: a passionate, dedicated artist whose primary intent is for his music to speak for itself.</p><p>
    
    At first glance Jandek might not seem like a ripe candidate for one tribute album, let alone two, due to the idiosyncratic, deeply personalized (a cynic might add atonal or unmusical) nature of his sound. But as Summersteps Records proved on their first such collection, 2000's <i>Naked in the Afternoon</i>, there's something about the unvarnished emotion and dissolute, blank-slate structures of Jandek's songs that allows the covering artist enough space to add a new distinctive voice while somehow retaining each piece's essential Jandekness. And <em>Down in a Mirror-- anchored by stellar performances from its bigger name contributors like Jeff Tweedy, Six Organs of Admittance, and the Mountain Goats-- again dips generously into the vast Corwood songbook, bringing rich and surprising rewards to the surface.</em></p><p>
    
    As evidenced by Tweedy's melodic opening version of ""Crack a Smile"", most of the acts here have sensibly transposed Jandek's unorthodox chords and phrases into decidedly more conventional song structures. (Though some stalwart fans have apparently had the patience to attempt a faithful transcription of Jandek's bizarre, dissonant guitar tabs, this has always struck me as a fool's errand.) For his cover of ""The Dunes""-- the original of which is one of Jandek's harrowing a cappella pieces-- Sebadoh's Eric Gaffney adds darkly atmospheric folk instrumentation, while Six Organs' Ben Chasny beautifully captures the bottomless solitude of ""I'll Sit Alone and Think About You"" utilizing his trademark Takoma-bred virtuosity.</p><p>
    
    Other standouts here include Acid Mothers Temple's Makoto Kawabata recasting ""Babe I Love You"" in dazzling, sky-high drones, Okkervil River's impassioned take on the obsessive ""Your Other Man"", and Brother JT-- a man eminently deserving of his own tribute album-- giving ""Message to the Clerk"" a delightfully dizzy psych-folk spin. Not surprisingly most of the contributors here tend to fall into the scrambled singer-songwriter archetype, with Home for the Def's goofy hip-hop/rockabilly medley of ""Cave In On You/European Jewel"" probably qualifying as the set's biggest stylistic leap.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the voices contained here are also universally male, giving the listener the perhaps not entirely inaccurate impression that Jandek's fanbase is predominantly a boy's club. (What, you're telling me that women aren't much into spooky loners anymore?) This uniformity of voice and style does risk monotony over the course of the album's 21 tracks, but let's face it, the same thing could be (and has been) said about Jandek's entire back catalog, and that certainly doesn't appear to be bothering his productivity any.</p></div>"|4202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4202-down-in-a-mirror-a-second-tribute-to-jandek/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

It's a free and rootless life, simultaneously unburdened and unblessed by notions of home and stability. Following the adage You have to live the life that you sing about in your song, Lucero have written about the touring life with complexity for years. On 2003's <em>That Much Further West</em>, Ben Nicholls sang about the strong lure of home (a faithful woman, a stable day-to-day) and the stronger call of the road, letting the contradictory emotions speak for themselves as Roy Berry's gremlin drums burst into intimate moments and pulled him even further west.</p><p>
    
    The tension between stasis and movement, between permanence and transience, saturates the band's follow-up, <em>Nobody's Darlings</em>, produced by Jim Dickinson. That Lucero would work with the man who recorded <em>Sister Lovers</em> and <em>Pleased to Meet Me</em> seems inevitable, at least in retrospect: They've been playing and recording with his sons Cody and Luther (two-thirds of the North Mississippi All-Stars) almost since Lucero's inception. Dickinson streamlines their songs and plays up the gritty bar-band sound, emphasizing the interplay between Nicholls' and Brian Venable's guitars. If the album loses a little spark towards the end (specifically on ""California"" and ""Last Night in Town""), Lucero still sound more like a live, dynamic unit than ever on songs like ""Sixteen"" (with Berry's snare rolling out the coda) and ""Noon As Dark As Midnight"" (with its dueling guitars adding to the tense country-noir atmosphere).</p><p>
    
    In addition to that collaboration, <em>Nobody's Darlings</em> marks the debut of the band's new label, Liberty and Lament, which they formed after Tiger Style went on indefinite hiatus and left <i>That Much Further West with no promotional push. ""Nobody's Darlings"" is a sober nod to such disappointments: Lucero are neither critics' nor women's darlings, just some guys who play music on a stage, half-ignored by the crowd, pleased whenever someone dances along. Again, Nicholls wails with his bluesy, grainy voice, and when he sings that's he's ""happy just watching her dance,"" Berry taps out a short waltz rhythm as commentary. ""Anjalee"", the album's catchiest track, is a brave-face postcard from the road, with Nicholls sending his love to his best girl back home-- ""tell my Anjalee I love her best."" But the kicker comes at the end: ""Don't tell 'em about how I'm lonely.""</i></p><p>
    
    Pushing his songwriting in new directions, Nicholls tries out a few narrative-driven songs, which are unpolished but still among the album's best. ""Bikeriders"" starts with a scenario that's been used a million times (in Robert Earl Keen's epic ""The Road Goes On Forever"", for instance)-- good girl meets bad boy, sparks fly-- but Nicholls tweaks it dramatically: instead of happily ever after, it's the start of a rocky relationship: ""Kathy's been with Benny Bauer ever since that night/ She's tried to leave him many times she can't quite get away/ She's seen more jails and courts and lawyers than she'd like to say.""</p><p>
    
    ""The War"" is the story of (presumably) Nicholls's grandfather's tour of duty during World War II. Backed only by his ragged acoustic guitar, Nicholls tells the story slowly and patiently, setting up the details before getting to the point: the narrator would rather get demoted than send his friends to their deaths. Just as it's impossible not to read this song as a commentary on the current war, it's also impossible to miss Nicholls comparing himself to the narrator and finding himself lacking somehow.

    duo's deliberately limited musical vocabulary.  And while it may be too soon to proclaim that fated day to be at hand, there are
    definitely signs on their bold, bewildering fifth album, <em>Get Behind Me Satan</em>, that Jack might be beginning to strain a bit
    at his self-fashioned yoke.</p><p>
    
    As far back as their Sympathy for the Record Industry days, the Stripes have been a considerably stranger act than is generally
    acknowledged-- their tender, borderline-twee childhood narratives, Cole Porter allusions, and dogged devotion to white tees and
    Santa pants have flown in the face of a garage-punk orthodoxy largely dictated by the iconography of 50s-era B-movies and trashy
    pulp paperbacks.</p><p>
    
    Still, the group's past digressions were only faint foreshadowing compared to the ones that populate <em>Get Behind Me Satan</em>.
    Here Jack and Meg have made an almost-entirely clean break with the jet-fueled blues-rock of <em>Elephant and </em><em>De Stijl,
    forsaking electric guitar on all but a couple of tracks to instead work with pianos, acoustic guitars, marimbas, and other assorted
    oddball percussion.</em></p><p>
    
    But even with this reconfigured instrumentation, the Stripes can't resist finding new ways to place unnecessary constrictions onto
    their work, as evidenced by the fact that <em>Get Behind Me Satan</em> was written, recorded, and released at an extreme breakneck
    pace.  As legend has it, none of these tracks were even fully written before the band entered Third Man Studios in March, and
    unfortunately, several songs bear the scars of their needlessly rushed delivery.  Although raw, combustible immediacy has always
    been a part of the White Stripes' charm, at some point Jack's desire for spontaneity could resemble sheer cussed laziness, and
    here the duo have granted a discouraging amount of real estate to what feel like unfinished sketches or works-in-progress.</p><p>
    
    Jack has cryptically described these songs as an exploration of ""characters and the ideal of truth,"" which apparently can be
    translated to despair-- and lots of it.  There's none of the sunny, innocent optimism of ""Apple Blossom"" or ""We're Going to Be
    Friends"" to leaven <em>Satan's mood; virtually every track drips with loneliness, alienation, and betrayal.  Even the album's
    most outwardly playful song, the bluegrass-tinged ""Little Ghost"", features a narrator so desperate in his isolation that he falls
    in love with an apparition.  (""When I held you I was really holding air."")</em></p><p>
    
    Still, a slight sting of venom appears to suit Jack well, and-- perhaps as testament to his time spent with Loretta Lynn-- <i>Satan</i>
    finds him delivering his most expressive and nuanced vocal performances to date.  Oddly, two of the album's most jarring tracks are
    among the few to feature electric guitar.  The opening ""Blue Orchid"" maintains the Stripes' impressive streak of stellar singles,
    as Jack's wild falsetto and processed, strangely electronic-sounding guitar combine for a heightened, spiteful crunch that's unlike
    anything they've ever done.  And even that sounds tame compared to the accusatory ""Red Rain"", on which the singer-- his voice thick
    with quavering distortion-- angrily confronts his betrayer (""If there's a lie/ Then there's a liar too/ And if there's a sin/ Then
    there's a sinner too"") with a spellbinding intensity, while a lurching floor of chiming toy bells and Hawaiian slide guitar spins
    beneath him.</p><p>
    
    Also exceptional is ""My Doorbell"", a strutting piano soul number that contains the album's most immediately nagging melodic hook
    over Meg's effectively funky cavewoman stomp.  Meg also contributes surprisingly subtle hand percussion to the quietly self-loathing
    folk of ""Ugly As I Seem""-- a song that illustrates that the gulf separating Jack from freak-folk artists like Six Organs' Ben
    Chasny or Devendra Banhart may not be as wide as it seems-- and what sounds like tympani to the majestic ""Take, Take, Take"", an
    ambitious, Who-like piece that follows an obsessive fan as he asks one favor too many of Rita Hayworth.  Unfortunately, tracks like ""The Nurse"" crumble beneath closer scrutiny, due to their over-emphasis on clever interior rhyming (""the maid that you've hired could never
    conspire to kill"") and soft-focused melodies that never seem able to make their way to the exits.</p><p>
    
    Other misfires include ""Forever for Her (Is Over for Me)"" and ""I'm Lonely (But I Ain't That Lonely Yet)"", two great titles that
    undoubtedly deserve better treatment than they're given here, and the mercifully brief ""Passive Manipulation"" which again begs the
    gentle suggestion that Meg not be allowed to sing lead.</p><p>
    
    Even with a generous handful of tracks that easily rank alongside the White Stripes' best work, <em>Get Behind Me Satan</em> remains
    a confounding record, one that wears its ""transitional album"" tag like a heavy peppermint-striped crown.  One can't help but feel
    that if perhaps the White Stripes had seen fit to take the necessary time to give cuts like ""Forever for Her"" or ""The Denial Twist""
    a sincere revision or two, we might've been looking at a stone classic.  As it stands, there's more than enough here to give Stripes
    fans cause to celebrate, although it may not inspire much faith that the duo will ever find the patience necessary to deliver upon
    their promising new innovations.</p></div>"|8653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8653-get-behind-me-satan/|7.3|Matthew Murphy

Tucked      between tracks by capital-C Composers like Bernard Parmegiani and Ilhan      Mimaroglu was Keith Whitman's ""Stereo Music For Serge Modular      Prototype"", recorded in 2003 and also included here on <i>Multiples</i>.</p>
<p>That Whitman was included among pioneers like Parmegiani wasn't      unusual given the vision of Sub Rosa's compilation; label founder Guy      Marc Hinant explicitly sets out to explore connections between early      electronics composers and artists working today (which isn't always to      the good-- <i>Vol. 3</i> contains a lame <i><i>Hotel Morgan</i></i> outtake from To Rococo      Rot). But the circumstances surrounding the creation of ""Stereo Music      For Serge Modular Prototype"" made it an interesting choice for      inclusion. The piece, like this album, was recorded primarily on      vintage      equipment at Harvard University's Studio for Electro-Acoustic      Composition, in which Whitman set up shop during a teaching residency.</p>
<p>Electronic music was born and raised in academia in part because      only large research institutions could afford the machinery. Most early      electronic composers had either a university or government appointment      and electronic music was seen as an extension of developments in      ""serious"" classical music. Whitman on the other hand came on the scene      working as Hrvatski in the late 199,0s making aggressive drum'n'bass, a      street-level form originally assembled using the cheapest tools.      There's      something fascinating about a musician weaned on home computers      returning to a grand old school sound laboratory.</p>
<p>Not sure if it's intentional, but the sequence of <i>Multiples</i> mirrors      developments in electronic music in the second half the 20th Century.      On      the album's first few tracks the music has an antiquated air, the      creaks      and drones touching on subconscious associations with mid-century      futurism, a time when we figured technology would eventually solve all      our problems. Early tracks reference the exploratory roots of the      genre,      with an emphasis on abrupt dynamic shifts and timbres that reflect the      physical properties of electricity.</p>
<p>As with David Toop's book <i>Ocean of Sound</i>, it all starts with the      gamelan. ""Stereo Music for Hi-Hat"" takes the resonance of a cymbal and      slows it to gong speed, conveying the ritual of the Javanese form with      clouds of metallic harmonics that seem to hang in the air. Parts one      and      three of ""Stereo Music for Serge Modular Prototype"" use a sound palette      pulled Pierre Schaeffer et al., at the Radiodiffusion-Television      Francaise, with white noise electro-wind and jarring squelches from      outer space that allow you to see knobs being twisted by human hands.      These are the sounds that sent sci-fi film composers in search of the      future of music.</p>
<p>By the time we get to ""Stereo Music for Yamaha Disklavier Prototype""      <i>Multiples hits its minimalism phase, as an opening burse of noise      dissolves into a looped series of piano notes that brings immediately      to      mind Steve Reich's late-60s phase pieces. The influence of Reich, Glass      and Riley is everywhere in the last ten years, obviously, but ""...Yamaha      Disklavier Prototype"" is a neat demonstration of how Whitman is able to      put such familiar influences to original use. As the piece builds and      the layers of piano begin to overlap he introduces a subtle melancholy      melody that starts low but eventually overwhelms the loops. Though its      roots come from carefully applied formalism, the piece develops a      tactile theatrical drama.</i></p>
<p>""Stereo Music for Farfisa Compact Duo Deluxe, Drum Kit"" has the same      sort of neo-tribal Popol Vuh feel as the <i>Antithesis</i> EP's ""Schnee"",      using      a dark, gothic organ a simple drum groove, and then Whitman saves the      best for last with the two-part ""Stereo Music for Acoustic Guitar,      Buchla Music Box 100, Hewlett Packaard Model 236 Oscillator, Electric      Guitar and Computer."" The tracks flow one into the next over the course      of 16 minutes, moving from the minimalism hinted at earlier in the      record into a sublime distillation of the possibilities in modern      signal      processing. Another repetitive melodic pattern, this time on acoustic      guitar, gradually transforms into a primordial soup of computer bleeps,      clicks, and eventually, thin tendrils of gauzy drone. Here forbearers      are Markus Popp and Nobukazu Takemura, though again Whitman's spin is      carefully designed to maximize emotional impact. The tail end of this      long piece is the most purely beautiful five minutes of sound I've      heard      in a couple years at least. Throughout the record Whitman, while using      the hardware and approach of early electronic masters, has a      songwriter's ear for structure and a commitment to human warmth.      Whatever their vintage, these machines sing.</p></div>"|8664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8664-multiples/|9.1|Mark Richardson

The music, like the moniker, is unnatural, an
    aberration: Diverse Fiery Furnaces hyperprog with the high-school
    theatricality of the Decemberists or Antony &amp; the Johnsons and the
    pop-classicist impulses of Heikki, Hercules, Camera Obscura, or Fan
    Modine. Hazlewood and Sinatra! Rodgers and Hammerstein! Architecture
    and Helsinki! On the first few listens, the songs wash by, disembodied
    like an ocean. They pass over as a wave of ephemeral cleverness.
    Eventually strong, if eccentric, songwriting emerges, establishing the
    band as a more-remote cousin to recent Memphis Industries baroque-pop
    signing Field Music. (Why haven't you downloaded that yet, BTW?)</p><p>
    
    If the references seem dizzying, it's surely by P:ano's design. On
    <em>Brigadoon</em>, their third album, the Vancouver-based group of Nick
    Krgovich, Larissa Loyva, Justin Kellam, and Julia Chirka bask in 22
    songs for 54 minutes, spanning at least as many influences along with
    instruments ranging from primitive Magnetic Fields electro-bleeps to
    strings, horns, handclaps and zithers. So when Krgovich intones
    slowly, in a Ben Foldsian everydude voice, ""I turned the orchestra
    loose,"" on the fabulous ""O.C."", the sadness is palpable. ""You would've
    off and left me anyway, believe me,"" he adds in unconsoling
    consolation, which the ghostly ""Cameroon"" echoes a track later.
    Horse-like clip-clops provide additional ornamentation on songs like
    ""You the Widow"" and ""Sweets"", developing a ridiculously quirky theme
    that builds into Mancini-swoon centerpiece ""Georgey the Horsey"" (a
    reference to Vancouver predecessor Good Horsey?) and Krgovich's slyly
    disconsolate, ""Will you trade me in for a new Shetland pony friend?""</p><p>
    
    To complicate matters, the songs sometimes unfold at the deliberate
    pace of Low. Given the capriciousness here and the occasional
    ""rumpa-pum-pum"", think <em>Christmas EP</em>, particularly on the
    album's standout, ""The Snow"", with a tin-pan alley verse and a
    jingling, reverb-laden chorus. Co-lead vocalist Loyva sings with the
    quiet, gorgeously real whisper of Yo La Tengo's drummer/singer Georgia
    Hubley, quaintly adapted for stage (the album title is, after all, a
    reference to a Lerner &amp; Loewe musical). Above the swooping guitars of
    ""Candy Is Nice"", she steers the band into dreamy chamber-pop,
    Krgovich's backing vocals echoing like those of My Morning Jacket's
    Jim James. Yet Loyva has the humor to proclaim, ""Take me to funky
    town!"" on faster-paced potential single ""Leave Me With the Boy"".
    (Don't worry, the room's spinning for me, too.) On ""Pure Evil"", the
    words ""Fleetwood Mac"" and ""Christine McVie"" spring to mind,
    pleasantly.</p><p>
    
    Though the album has a few tracks too many-- ""The Rescuer"" drags and
    ""The Ghost Pirates"" cloys-- it's hard to fault this band for their
    ambition. With a train-like rhythm, ""Light o' Love"" hearkens
    romantically to a turn-of-the-20th-century America that probably never
    really existed-- despite the <em>Mind Games</em>-era Lennon saxophone,
    ""Somebody Get Me Annette"" is strangely fascinating (bassoon!), and the
    meticulously cool (temperature-wise) ""Dark Hills"" hits like a
    half-remembered Alan Parsons production from '80s soft-rock radio,
    aside from the ethereal backing vocals and marching-band martiality. A
    few stronger choruses, and P:ano, despite their strange appellation
    and forbidding obtuseness, could go on to fashion the album of next
    year. Or they could end up another vaguely celebrated post-Elephant 6
    omnivourous weirdness collective. Dudes, I just write shit.</p></div>"|6574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6574-brigadoon/|7.4|Marc Hogan

    you admire; either will suffice under the right circumstances,
    although the ideal is for both to be wrapped up in one package. Here's
    a basic exemplary schema: J.K. Rowling (enjoy), Jacques Derrida
    (admire), Elmore Leonard (both). <em>Star Wars Episode III</em> (enjoy),
    <em>My Dinner with Andre</em> (admire), <em>Kung Fu Hustle</em> (both).
    The schema breaks down vis-á-vis television, which lacks the patience
    for the (admire) category, but holds up against orchestral indie rock:
    Explosions in the Sky (enjoy), A Northern Chorus (admire), Godspeed
    You! Black Emperor (both).</p><p>
    What makes the (admire) category worthwhile is that you can learn from
    or be challenged by it-- in other words, while fun is, well, fun, it's
    not the only sensation we seek from our artistic diversions. We also
    crave to be provoked and disturbed and psychically reoriented. Since
    there's not much that <em>Bitter Hands Resign</em> has to teach me, and
    since its dramatic maneuvers are too soothing and commonplace (if
    competently executed) to challenge any of my assumptions or
    sensibilities, I can only admire it in an abstract way.</p><p>
    But if it's a musical massage you're after, and more to the point, if
    you like the idea of Coldplay's Chris Martin singing for Explosions in
    the Sky, this third LP from Ontario sextet A Northern Chorus will be
    the object of your pleasure and esteem. Resonating with Pink Floyd's
    cold and swirling qualities, EITS's delicate textural layers,
    Godspeed's epic thrust and Sigur Rós's inexorable freeze, A Northern
    Chorus has turned out the record that Death Cab for Cutie might make
    after taking an online classical composition course and a near-fatal
    overdose of tranquilizer cocktails. The long, dramatic arcs of languid
    guitar, weepy cello, silky organs, and lugubrious percussion are
    overstated in a necessary way, but grandiosity works better musically
    than lyrically, and I'd have preferred this album without the breathy,
    direly grave falsettos. </p><p>
    I'm saying: When you're taking an ice bath, the last thing you need is
    someone reminding you how cold it is, and lines like ""Angels are on
    their way out/ They'll lead us through the darkness to the right
    place"" (as warbled over the gentle, trebly percolation of ""Subjects &amp;
    Matter"") seem to overstate a case for hope in the face of modern dread
    that the music tacitly makes on its own, that's already been made by
    similar musics many times over. But like I said in a recent Album Leaf
    review, it's really about headspace-- if you're in the right one, this
    sad-sack skygaze epic will trickle dazzling colors across your
    firmament.</p></div>"|476.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/476-bitter-hands-resign/|6.0|Brian Howe

Memphis Bleek is, like Game, a derivative, artless MC with enormous resources, but he doesn't have a great album in him. Memphis Bleek has released four forgettable albums on Roc-A-Fella records while stronger artists like M.O.P. and Ol' Dirty Bastard moldered on the shelf. His greatest track and only hit remains ""Is That Yo Bitch?"", a song Jay-Z scrapped from his </em><em>Vol. 3 album, and one that features Jigga and Missy Elliott in starring roles. Bleek has never gone platinum, and he probably never will. And yet Jay keeps him around. That's loyalty for you.</em></p><p>
    Bleek has stood onstage for Jay for nearly a decade without ever absorbing any of his mentor's effortless, swaggering elan or thoughtful, melancholy eloquence. He has a harsh, urgent, forceful flow; it's good for guest verses on battle-rap posse tracks, but it wears thin over the course of a single song, let alone an album. <em>534 features A-list producers such as Just Blaze and 9th Wonder, but Bleek rarely holds up his part of the track. His voice sounds OK over the exploding drums and surging horns of Swizz Beatz' club banger ""Like That"", but he derails the track with his staggeringly lame party-rap lyrics (""Slow motion for me, like ya ass was screwed up / Make you move like <i>The Matrix</i> when dude was ducking slugs/ Bleek the Black Sheep, mami, now pick it up""). On a sweeping, cinematic track like 9th Wonder's ""Alright"", he's just bizarrely terrible (""Don't confuse M with none of the bullshit/ To the streets I'm tied like my mama's tubes is""). On an already lame track like Demi-Doc and Irv Gotti's tinkly, watery thug-love snoozer ""Infatuated"", he falls even flatter, failing to project even the slightest hint of affection. He doesn't switch his flow up once over the course of the album, and he can't write a hook.</em></p><p>
    Only a few tracks on <em>534 play to Bleek's strengths. He's happiest spitting gutter battle stuff, and he sounds best when he has better rappers to play off of, and that's exactly what he gets on ""First, Last and Only"", sandwiched between berserk gun-talk of Lil Fame and Billy Danze of M.O.P. And along with his new protégé Livin' Proof, he murders Chad Hamilton's rippling old-school bounce track on ""Get Low"". (Proof has a greasy, desperate side-of-the-mouth delivery, and it's depressing to contemplate the possibility that Memphis Bleek may be the first rapper to be overshadowed by both his mentor and his protégé.) But </em><em>534's best track is ""Dear Summer"", wherein Jay-Z calmly and gracefully bids farewell to his favorite time of year over Just Blaze's dusty, Madlib-influenced lope. ""Like all good things, we must come to an end/ Please show the same love to my friends,"" Jay pleads at the end of the track. Jay wants Bleek to succeed, and he usually gets what he wants, but the best thing about ""Dear Summer"" is that Bleek is nowhere to be found.</em></p></div>"|1162.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1162-534/|4.3|Tom Breihan

TO THE KIDS!</strong></p><p>  When you start to measure the amount of music you listen to in gigabytes and jumbo-size Case Logics, it's easy to forget the awesome power of the simple declarative statement.  Nothing against all those 30-piece ensembles, nautically focused concept albums, intricate field-recording pastiches, and three-hour drum circles that dominate our musical neighborhood, but sometimes it's refreshing to hear a band maximally juicing a single sentiment down to two-minute concentrate.  Meet South London's Art Brut: They're here to fill that vacancy.</p><p> <strong>I'VE SEEN HER NAKED, <em>TWICE</em>!  I'VE SEEN HER NAKED, <em>TWICE</em>!</strong></p><p>  That it's difficult for me to find a recent point of reference for Art Brut is a testament to just how self-serious indie rock has become-- although they do share a refreshingly bratty quality with proto-punks like the Buzzcocks and Television Personalities. Frontman Eddie Argos even appears to share Joey Ramone's love for first-person narratives that sound no more complex than a transcript of just-some-guy's thoughts on a completely unremarkable day.  Ruminations on ex-girlfriends, new girlfriends, little brothers, modern art, his band, other bands, Italian currency, Los Angeles-- all are expressed in language too shallow for even diary-scrawling, but lifted up to anthemic status through sheer multiple exclamation-point enthusiasm.</p><p> <strong>I CAN'T STAND THE SOUND OF THE... VELVET UNDERGROUND!</strong></p><p>  Oh my God, heresy!  But of course, it's only half-serious, a joking reminder to today's bands that VU ended up writing (gasp!) unabashedly fun songs like ""Sweet Jane"" and ""What Goes On"", too.  If these sloppy, succinct three-chord bashers fail to tread any ground that isn't already well-worn, they do so in an appealing way that underscores Argos' oscillations between humility and delusions of grandeur.  Art Brut might display more versatility than one-tempo Ramones, but not by much, contenting themselves with fast songs (""18,000 Lira"", ""Bad Weekend"") or slow songs (""Rusted Guns of Milan"", ""Stand Down"").  It's just enough to give these minutiae-obsessed songs their paradoxical fist-pumping grandeur, and not a bit more.</p><p> <strong>NO MORE SONGS ABOUT SEX AND DRUGS AND ROCK N' ROLL... IT'S BOOOOOORING!</strong></p><p>  That this line comes amidst the album's most straight-ahead rock number-- and that about 90% of Argos' lyrics discuss these very topics-- is probably the best joke on the album, though it's not wanting for humorous company.  The sly origin story ""Formed a Band"" and art-fetish celebration ""Modern Art"" (both re-recorded here from their 2004 single versions) may have laid the foundation of Art Brut's blog rep, but <em>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</em>'s new material is equally hilarious when it aspires to be.  Argos paints the perfect picture of musical awakening in ""My Little Brother"", the subject of which expresses his frustration through mixtapes of ""bootlegs and B-sides,"" and makes ""Emily Kane"" more than just a casual remembrance of young love by being able to recollect the last time he saw her, right down to the second.  It's tempting to think of Art Brut as the foreign replacement for the catchy/clever observances Weezer used to traffic, the escape fantasy of ""Moving to L.A."" obliterating the clichés of ""Beverly Hills"", with its shirtless motorcycling, hanging with Axl and Morrissey, and foolish tattoos.</p><p> <strong>HAVEN'T READ THE <em>NME</em> IN SO LONG... DON'T KNOW WHAT GENRE WE BELONG!</strong></p><p>  Well, let me try to help.  See if you can follow this: Art Brut, through their thoroughly unpretentious embrace of pretentiousness, are the most punk new band I've heard in years, punk having lost itself long ago to the pretentiousness of unpretentiousness.  So even though Argos boasts of wanting to ""write the song/ That makes Israel and Palestine get along,"" and planning to perform Art Brut's hit eight weeks in a row on ""Top of the Pops"", any chance you might take him seriously is deflated by the little meta-moments like the one caps-locked above.  As with the best LCD Soundsystem singles, <em>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</em> is at times some of the best music criticism going right now, and far better than our boringly verbose bullshit 'cause you can dance to it.</p><p> <strong>AND ART BRUT, WE'VE ONLY JUST STARTED!</strong></p><p>  The optimism of that statement is infectious and hard to argue with, though I'm perfectly aware of the large pile of empty Brit-hype firecrackers that went off with a barely a whimper Stateside.  Given their reliance on dry English humour (yes, two u's) and lack of a timely U.S. distribution deal, it's unlikely Art Brut will fare well as well with North American listeners as fellow countrymen Bloc Party, Franz Ferdinand, and the Futureheads.  But then, just a year ago, it seemed unlikely that any of <em>those</em> bands would find fans in the States at all, let alone enough to spark yet another small-scale British invasion-- and all told, it's not hard to imagine their dagger-sharp guitar lines and pop-fueled bash carving its own niche in those other bands' wake if given the opportunity.  The only thing to do is start a letter-writing campaign, suffer the import prices, and hope Art Brut's got enough in their tank for another album or two.  I can't wait to hear ""Recorded a Sophomore Album!""</p><p> </p></div>"|475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/475-bang-bang-rock-roll/|8.9|Rob Mitchum

    begin.  For starters, the trio employs 27 guest musicians on these 13 tracks, and every song is packed to the gills with sounds
    and melodies and countermelodies and detours and left-turn movements.  It's maximalism in the extreme-- and with barely time to
    breathe between brass charts, peals of synthesizer, elaborate string parts, and big three-part harmonies, it's easy to get lost
    in the labyrinthine arrangements.</em></p><p>
    
    Additionally, the album fits nicely alongside the Fiery Furnaces' <i>Blueberry Boat</i> and Architecture in Helsinki's <i>In Case
    We Die</i> in a recent string of albums that might best be described as ""hyperprog"": The entire record plays as a long, winding
    suite, where one crazy idea never has to wait long to meet its match, and songs explode into headlong gallops only to capitulate
    seconds later into fluttering orchestral passages or odd accordion solos.  As with all hyperprog outings, short attention spans
    are likely to enjoy the album's grab-bag nature, while big-picture people will appreciate the great unified sweep of it all.</p><p>
    
    Head of Femur don't wait long to posit their more-is-more theory, kicking down the door to their technicolor world with ""Elliott
    Gould Is in California Split"", a song that makes their jam-packed 2003 debut <em>Ringodom or Proctor seem restrained by comparison.
    Super Furry harmonies and taut basslines weave through a teeming forest of violins, glockenspiels, trumpets, and jittery guitars,
    spilling into rock passages that sound like a hundred different Beach Boys ringtones going off simultaneously.  A track bearing
    the title of their previous album follows, swooping in with baroque strings, wild horns, XTC-ish guitars, and falsetto oohing and
    aahing.  In fact, it goes through so many different sections, the band could probably have made six songs out of it.  But then,
    that seems to be the point.</em></p><p>
    
    In the midst of all the marching-band-in-a-penny-arcade madness there are a few songs that step back a (little) bit from the brink
    of aural overload and show the band for the skilled tunesmiths they are.  ""Skirts Are Takin' Over"" is an oceanic ballad anchored by
    piano and mellotron, limiting horns and other instruments to broad textural strokes.  Likewise, ""Easy Street"" is loaded with all
    manner of instrumentation, focused into one solidly conventional pop song with laser-like efficiency.  ""Oh You're
    Blue"" boasts an amazing string arrangement that segues seamlessly into a rococo orchestral passage.  And of course, it splits off
    into several other directions from there, all of which is better listened to than described.</p><p>
<i>Hysterical Stars</i> closes on its most majestic note with ""Jack and the Water Buffalo"", a song that descends from fairly dry,
    modest beginnings into a cavernous, reverb-drenched second half, aided by brooding cello and a fantastic piano part.  It basically
    takes five minutes to achieve what most of the songs on the album accomplish in half that time, but in doing so lays bare the
    incredible amount of craft this album must have taken to assemble.  Even the album's greatest failure (the ponderous, nonsensical,
    and ultimately annoying ""Sausage Canoe"") is intricately and intelligently arranged.  There are so many elements to mentally catalog
    that the first listen is a severe shock to the senses, a musical equivalent of what Dorothy might have felt like when first stepping
    out of her house into Oz.</p></div>"|3973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3973-hysterical-stars/|7.9|Joe Tangari

Extremists are universally
    shunned by normal folk; they lurk beyond the outer fringes of society,
    where no one with a sweet corn niblet of sense dares tread. Extremists
    don't push boundaries, they pretend to ignore them-- then return to
    defecate on the masses, spiteful cretins they are. Extremists don't
    bother releasing records; they're local basement legends, if anything.
    Extremists don't have brethren who are signed to Sub Pop.</p><p>
    
    Okay, okay-- so Yellow Swans make industrial noise. (I thought I had
    ya!) But theirs is sonic stench that's totally worth listening to.
    Think of <em>Dreamed</em> as kind of like Norwegian Christmas Pudding: Finding
    the almond at its center doesn't promise extra presents from St. Nick,
    but it will help you attain inner peace. As with most music of its
    ilk, the trick is finding the Eye of the storm. On <em>Dreamed</em>, Yellow
    Swans make the task seem easy: It's not the noise, but the rhythm,
    that dominates. Saddle up and take the 15-minute ""Garrison"" for a
    ride. Now double back and imagine the song without its insistent,
    pinioning drum machines and ask yourself if without them you would
    have made it half as far.</p><p>
    
    Even sans the chicks and clicks, <em>Dreamed</em> is still gentile compared to
    the shock-and-awe of last year's <em>Bring the Neon War Home. By Swans'
    standards, </em><em>Dreamed</em> is like an hour-long Om, so there's some titular
    propriety. The album, if not exactly lullaby-like, is impressively
    fluid. A sturdy spine of drone withstands the rigors of furious
    industrial beats, chopped feedback like metallic dandruff, and, of
    course, the electro-noise tool of choice, dot matrix printer squalls.
    The band even treats us to some rare melody. Seething with
    oversaturated guitar swells and whirls of chirruping noise that can
    only be described as the sound of all the world's digital information
    being sucked through a wormhole, ""Drowning in Paradise"" is the most
    terrestrial thing Yellow Swans have done. It's more Eno than
    Whitehouse. Some might call it pleasant.</p><p>
    
    Still, noiseniks will be noiseniks. Swans are acrimonious little
    creatures, and <em>Dreamed</em> doesn't hesitate to chomp a dangling finger or
    two. Echoey, indecipherable utterances on ""Gold Rush"" and ""Garrison""
    add an eerie depth, suggesting that if there's life within these
    miasmas, inhabitants aren't breathing clean air or sending their kids
    to the Friends Academy. Venus-hot opener ""Untitled"", this collection's
    harshest (and, mercifully, shortest) track, tears through sound like
    old terry cloth using all manners of oscillators and torture devices.
    Many a soulseeker won't make it through this first, grisly test of
    will. Dismiss it on ear-protection grounds if you must, but, as an
    entry point into Yellow Swans' scabrous oeuvre, <em>Dreamed</em> is ideal.</p></div>"|8911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8911-dreamed/|7.3|Sam Ubl

    synths, staticky samples, and scattershot drums, all waxing and waning
    around immovable slabs of buzzing bass. It splits the difference between the eschatological IDM
    of Boards of Canada's <em>Geogaddi</em> and Keith Fullerton Whitman's
    coruscating dronescapes.</p><p>
    There are loads of sounds embedded in <em>Burner</em>. For instance, what's
    that thing called, with the bridge of electricity running between two
    antennae? <em>Zzzzhk</em>! <em>Zzzzhk</em>! Jacob's Ladder, I think.
    That's on there, among the layered angelic harmonies of ""Untitled
    One"". There are also clamoring crowds, car alarms, banging gavels,
    laughing children, lawn sprinklers, plentiful variations on static,
    and what one might call white noise, if one erroneously believed that
    white noise was just any old racket (it's not). There are also some
    uninteresting sounds: More than once, Nosdam juxtaposes his
    kaleidoscopic drone against samples from old educational recordings, which has been done to death in instrumental hip-hop and
    electronic collage-based music.</p><p>
    If interesting sounds aren't enough for you there are many cameos, and a weird sort of crossover
    aspect to the record. Two songs, ""11th Ave Freakout"" parts one and
    two, crib their titles from Fog's recent LP, although Andrew Broder
    appears on neither the shimmering first part, replete with sampled
    beatdown sounds and a Vanilla Ice sample, or part two, where Mike
    Patton and Why? add vocal harmonies to Nosdam's spiraling
    synths. But Broder does contribute, along with Múm's Orvar Smarason,
    to ""Small Mr. Man Pants"", a peristaltic pulse teeming with whistles,
    horns, and woodwinds. The song-- named for Nosdam's old group cLOUDDEAD--
    finds Liz Hosdon's long, sonorous syllables paddling in a bassy soup,
    and Jessica Bailiff adds some layered vocals to the clipped electric
    bolts of ""Untitled Three"" and the closing epic ""Flying Saucer Attack"".
    </p><p>
    You've heard music like this before: The saturation of sound seems to
    conjure some amorphous pre-conscious roar; the samples and cadences scan as a Futurist ode to the din
    of city life;  and the results can be read, grandiosely, as a timeless
    distillation of human consciousness, or, more modestly, as a literal
    take on the truism that ""music is all around us."" For a genre that
    wants to evoke mysterious, uncharted territories, it's beginning to
    show signs of predictability, and while Odd Nosdam hews admirable
    results from it, it's just about time for an increasingly defined
    border to be pushed outward, into more nebulous territory, again.</p></div>"|6089.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6089-burner/|7.0|Brian Howe

    1. Name album <em>1988.</em></p><p>
    2. Use the number ""88"" 13 times in your intro.</p><p>
    3. Crib samples or lyrics from classic cuts (""Road to the Riches"", ""Tramp"", ""Welcome to the Terrordome"") from 1988, or any other
    Golden Year that is suitable.  If the source song is about finding a way out of the ghetto, make yours about your charitable fucking
    of both fat and skinny girls.  If it's about women reclaiming power from a patriarchal society, make it about schemin' bitches.
    Fractured existentialism?  Fuck that!  Talk about how everyone jocks your shit and denigrate anyone who hasn't bought your album.</p><p>
    
    4. Name a song ""Boom-Box"". Sample Sal from <i>Do the Right Thing</i> bugging out (no pun intended) because Radio Raheem has ""Fight
    the Power"" on blast in his pizzeria. Reference Radio Raheem in your lyrics to make sure the listeners get what you're saying. Pretend
    you've never seen the film. Talk about how awesome your boom box is and how it's really loud, much louder than some other dude's
    boom box.</p><p>
    
    5. Sample drum break from ""Sucker MCs"". At the end of the song, say, ""It's like that."" This is a double reference to Run-DMC's first
    single. It's from 1983, but still, cred factor is super large.</p><p>
    
    6. Here's a doozy! Reference Richard Wright's <em>Native Son in the title of a song. Now, model the storytelling style of your
    rhyme after Slick Rick's ""Children's Story"" (19<i>89</i>, so close).  Instead of the sticky social commentary and needless violence,
    talk about how some kid accidentally steals computers from the building that employs his mom as a cleaning lady.</em></p><p>
    
    7. Okay, while you're on the heavy tip, every album needs at least two ""think pieces.""  This is an independent label thing.  Keeps
    internet fans happy.  With that in mind, serious song numero dos should be about the police.  You don't really need to say much other
    than cops are racist murderers and how you aren't going out like that.  White dudes love that shit.  Sample some Richard Pryor at the
    end.  He was the Dave Chappelle of the 80s.</p><p>
    
    8. Speaking of white dudes, put one on your record.  Aesop Rock is good.  Let him spit a hook or something.  We're losing the thread
    of 1988 concept here, but it was tenuous to begin with.</p><p>
    
    9. Use the tugboat horns from Biz Markie's ""Vapors"" and make your voice sound like Masta Ace.  Juice Crew!  Back on track with the
    1988, bitch!</p><p>
    
    10. Bookend the album with uplifting songs called something like ""Anything Is Possible"" or ""Liberated"", but feel free to just talk
    about how everyone jocks your shit.  Make sure everyone knows that they jock your shit.</p><p>
    
    11. Finally, because you're going to be on an independent label, this puts you in the ""underground,"" whatever that is.  It's important
    that you put up a veil of respect for the ""old school.""  Your beats need to be dirty and sampled.  You can talk about bitches, hoes,
    getting money, crime and shit, but don't get too innovative with the production.  It's a tip-off that you're trying to sell out.  The
    underground is about taking it back to the ""essence"" of hip-hop, not innovation.</p></div>"|1161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1161-1988/|6.0|Peter Macia

Maybe <em>I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning was supposed to be Oberst's (and possibly Saddle Creek's) transition from bumpkin adolescent malcontent to world-weary traveler, but there's too much Holden Caulfield pathos permeating the album to signify a major persona reconstruction. Likewise, Maria Taylor's been spewing out WB-style melodrama with Saddle Creek darlings Azure Ray and Now It's Overhead for the last half decade, creating somber, gooey music fit for the closing credits of any ""Gilmore Girls"" episode. </em><em>11:11, however, hardly pretends to be Taylor's heady, ""grown-up"" solo album, but rather an expanded cross-section of her Azure Ray and Now It's Overheard contributions.</em></p><p>
    Taylor's strengths and weaknesses are completely exposed on the album, most notably her tendency to focus on melody and allow the instrumentation to mire in the background. Opener ""Leap Year"" demonstrates this imbalance perfectly. Convoluted strings, synthesizers, and piano lethargically float over a limp electronic percussion foundation. Meanwhile, Taylor drenches each of her breathily sung lyrics with dewy-eyed melancholy, allowing the vocals to steer the track rather than the nearly homogenous chord progression. After Taylor wistfully gasps the song's final lyrics ""PleaseÉcomeÉsoon"", the song's emotional force stalls over a 45-second instrumental outro.</p><p>
    Fortunately, Taylor's tentative electronica dabbling only affects ""Leap Year"" and the lead-footed ""dance"" track ""One for the Shareholder,"" which blatantly ignores the perils of Oberst's mediocre <em>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</em>. ""Nature Song"" and ""Birmingham 1982,"" on the other hand, showcase Taylor sticking with what she knows-- organic Southern-flavored folk pop. Sure, Taylor's just reinventing the wheel with these tracks, but nowhere else on the album does such synergy exist between her swollen melodies and humble acoustic.</p><p>
    Of course, not even these moments can conceal the one degree of separation between Saddle Creek and ""Dawson's Creek"". ""Song Beneath the Song"" takes cues from B-level James Van Der Beek dialogue, repeating ""it's not a love song"" over a monotonous, textbook I-IV-V chord progression. With its innocuous piano and hooks rounded off into drawn-out cooing, ""Hitched"" is a Cat Power song lined with Styrofoam-- just too damn safe. On select tracks, Taylor may show boldness and an independency from Azure Ray and Now It's Overhead, but ultimately <em>11:11</em> settles for pandering to the backpack-toting, drama-thirsty WB demographic that has dovetailed so immaculately with the Saddle Creek universe.</p></div>"|8290.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8290-1111/|6.2|Adam Moerder

Do they deserve     your money when more new music than ever crowds the shelves?</p>
<p>Well, yes.  Obviously.  Especially since these new masters are retailing for a beyond-fair 10 bucks.  (Whatever the quality of the     material, charging nearly $20 for catalog items is robbery.)  Unlike the bulked-up, slightly lardy <i>Paid in Full reissue from     1999, this edition tacks on a few bonuses without making a big deal out of it.  (Full disclosure: I am an original-sequencing purist.)     And of course, the music is as essential as the James Brown whose skinny legs supported large chunks of their legacy.</i></p>
<p>It's hard to believe, now that the Neptunes have made zen thrift signify in the nouveau-riche top 10, but these minimal and sometimes     unfriendly (though never less than seductive and often galvanic) tracks represented an anti-pop move.  You have to rewind back to the     mid-80s-- not a super time for ""urban"" music outside of a nascent rap scene still underground enough to need label addresses at     the end of singles reviews.  Luther Vandross.  Anita Baker.  Lionel Richie outselling all other black artists of 1984.  Is it any     wonder in this context that booming kickdrums, garden claw snares, bacteria-disrupting sub-bass, and tales (freaky, funny, raw, and     true) seemed the only viable alternative?</p>
<p>Eric Barrier and William Griffin benefited by being in the right place (NYC) at the right time (just as rap began fumbling towards     its own sense of importance). Their mentor, Marley Marl, had just begun to work with the digital sampler, a tentative step away from     the fixed parameters of both drum machines and house bands, and towards open-ended creative theft.  Marl, Schoolly D, Scott La     Rock and others had defined mid-80s rap as a crash of stiff, hard, stupid (in the best sense) Linn drums and astounding B.S. rhymes.     If it was hip-hop's garage-rock-- a street reaction against the first wave of crossover pop-rap-- then it was all but waiting for     the kind of intellectual vernacular so beloved of critics to ""take it to the next level.""</p>
<p>Griffin threw his Kangol in the ring from the opening lines of Eric B &amp; Rakim's debut single, ""Eric B Is President"": ""I came in the     door/ I said it before/ I never let the mic magnetize me no more."" It is one of the 10 or so most famous verses in rap. Rakim's     innovation was applying a patina of intellectual detachment to rap's most sacred cause: talking shit about how you're a better rapper     than everyone else.  He was the supreme exponent of rapping-about-rapping, an almost lost art now that every MC carries a thousand     pounds of crack-dealing backstory around with him.</p>
<p>Rakim immediately projected his self-belief-- not so much messianic as matter-of-fact-- that he was the best. He got away with it     every time he opened his mouth and that voice came out: authoritative, burnished, possessing an unflappable sense of rhythm like a     drumming prodigy. You only think of his restricted subject matter as a failing in the wake of Big, Pac, Cube, even Chuck D.  You     don't go to Rakim for political insight, inner turmoil, or sex chat.  You go to Rakim for an endless display of pure skill.  He     encourages the grading mindset.  The big reason why Nas is runner-up is because he injected some pathos and fallibility into the     preternatural control thing.</p>
<p>Skills, of course, can be their own reward, when put into the service of exciting people rather than showing off.  (Okay, or a mix     of the two.)  And when the records are playing, it's hard to begrudge them their 30-yard stare.  <i>Paid in Full</i>, the debut, is     more laidback and funky, though padded at seven vocals and three instrumentals.  It reprised the debut single, a moody, atypical     fusion full of stark dub-like dropouts, mod stutter effects, and flat production. It's obvious why they stuck it at the end of the     album; at that point, rap was moving so fast that records released six months prior were already old hat.</p>
<p>The second single, ""My Melody"", is pre-""funky"" hip-hop par excellence and a 2005 hit in waiting, with little more than a concrete     cracking kickdrum and a blunt-edged bassthrob. (Of course, R's flow would immediately mark him out as an old man amongst today's     shouters, growlers, and mumblers.)  ""I Know You Got Soul"" let some human grit into the man-machine via JB, and momentarily fucked     up everyone's concept of the space-time continuum until cyborgizing old drummers became common enough to show up in Milli Vanilli     records.  ""Paid in Full"" was kind of light and fun, even if its subject matter was dead serious. Getting paid for studio work? Not     the corner? Not the grind? The future was wide open.</p>
<p>Both of these albums contain too much filler to get a free ""classic"" pass, but the highs of <i>Follow the Leader</i> are as high as     any rap group has gotten.  The title track fleshes out Rakim's metaphorical conceit via hellish high-speed-chase music.  The beats     rattle, the bass seethes, the flutes and strings screech like Blaxploitation crossed with the cheap urgency of an Italian zombie     movie.  But what's scariest and most exhilarating is how, for all the track's runaway train momentum, it feels inexorable, implacable,     utterly in control of itself.  Rakim's delivery of the final verse may be the most exciting-- at least in terms of breath control--     slice of rap the genre has yet delivered. (And no, Twista doesn't count.)</p>
<p>""Microphone Fiend"" rattled sleigh bells harder than anyone until Pete Rock showed up, and the stabbing dynamics of the guitar sample     harassed the ear something awful. The chopper blade beats of ""Lyrics of Fury"" almost render the genre it would help to inspire (jungle)     redundant.   In this era, when almost all rap was ""fast rap,"" tracks like these and ""The R"" were the roughneck alternative to a     burgeoning hip-house, beats impacting your body as your mind swam at the density of words.  Unfortunately, by the time they released     <i>Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em</i>, an attempt to extend the deft simplicity of their debut, in 1990, they were already old news. (Perhaps     best exemplified by the cover of 1992's <i>Don't Sweat the Technique.)  Deposed kings before they'd even hit their 30s, they've     limped through the ensuing decade about which the most that can be said is that they didn't scuff up their legacy too much.</i></p>

Do they deserve     your money when more new music than ever crowds the shelves?</p>
<p>Well, yes.  Obviously.  Especially since these new masters are retailing for a beyond-fair 10 bucks.  (Whatever the quality of the     material, charging nearly $20 for catalog items is robbery.)  Unlike the bulked-up, slightly lardy <i>Paid in Full reissue from     1999, this edition tacks on a few bonuses without making a big deal out of it.  (Full disclosure: I am an original-sequencing purist.)     And of course, the music is as essential as the James Brown whose skinny legs supported large chunks of their legacy.</i></p>
<p>It's hard to believe, now that the Neptunes have made zen thrift signify in the nouveau-riche top 10, but these minimal and sometimes     unfriendly (though never less than seductive and often galvanic) tracks represented an anti-pop move.  You have to rewind back to the     mid-80s-- not a super time for ""urban"" music outside of a nascent rap scene still underground enough to need label addresses at     the end of singles reviews.  Luther Vandross.  Anita Baker.  Lionel Richie outselling all other black artists of 1984.  Is it any     wonder in this context that booming kickdrums, garden claw snares, bacteria-disrupting sub-bass, and tales (freaky, funny, raw, and     true) seemed the only viable alternative?</p>
<p>Eric Barrier and William Griffin benefited by being in the right place (NYC) at the right time (just as rap began fumbling towards     its own sense of importance). Their mentor, Marley Marl, had just begun to work with the digital sampler, a tentative step away from     the fixed parameters of both drum machines and house bands, and towards open-ended creative theft.  Marl, Schoolly D, Scott La     Rock and others had defined mid-80s rap as a crash of stiff, hard, stupid (in the best sense) Linn drums and astounding B.S. rhymes.     If it was hip-hop's garage-rock-- a street reaction against the first wave of crossover pop-rap-- then it was all but waiting for     the kind of intellectual vernacular so beloved of critics to ""take it to the next level.""</p>
<p>Griffin threw his Kangol in the ring from the opening lines of Eric B &amp; Rakim's debut single, ""Eric B Is President"": ""I came in the     door/ I said it before/ I never let the mic magnetize me no more."" It is one of the 10 or so most famous verses in rap. Rakim's     innovation was applying a patina of intellectual detachment to rap's most sacred cause: talking shit about how you're a better rapper     than everyone else.  He was the supreme exponent of rapping-about-rapping, an almost lost art now that every MC carries a thousand     pounds of crack-dealing backstory around with him.</p>
<p>Rakim immediately projected his self-belief-- not so much messianic as matter-of-fact-- that he was the best. He got away with it     every time he opened his mouth and that voice came out: authoritative, burnished, possessing an unflappable sense of rhythm like a     drumming prodigy. You only think of his restricted subject matter as a failing in the wake of Big, Pac, Cube, even Chuck D.  You     don't go to Rakim for political insight, inner turmoil, or sex chat.  You go to Rakim for an endless display of pure skill.  He     encourages the grading mindset.  The big reason why Nas is runner-up is because he injected some pathos and fallibility into the     preternatural control thing.</p>
<p>Skills, of course, can be their own reward, when put into the service of exciting people rather than showing off.  (Okay, or a mix     of the two.)  And when the records are playing, it's hard to begrudge them their 30-yard stare.  <i>Paid in Full</i>, the debut, is     more laidback and funky, though padded at seven vocals and three instrumentals.  It reprised the debut single, a moody, atypical     fusion full of stark dub-like dropouts, mod stutter effects, and flat production. It's obvious why they stuck it at the end of the     album; at that point, rap was moving so fast that records released six months prior were already old hat.</p>
<p>The second single, ""My Melody"", is pre-""funky"" hip-hop par excellence and a 2005 hit in waiting, with little more than a concrete     cracking kickdrum and a blunt-edged bassthrob. (Of course, R's flow would immediately mark him out as an old man amongst today's     shouters, growlers, and mumblers.)  ""I Know You Got Soul"" let some human grit into the man-machine via JB, and momentarily fucked     up everyone's concept of the space-time continuum until cyborgizing old drummers became common enough to show up in Milli Vanilli     records.  ""Paid in Full"" was kind of light and fun, even if its subject matter was dead serious. Getting paid for studio work? Not     the corner? Not the grind? The future was wide open.</p>
<p>Both of these albums contain too much filler to get a free ""classic"" pass, but the highs of <i>Follow the Leader</i> are as high as     any rap group has gotten.  The title track fleshes out Rakim's metaphorical conceit via hellish high-speed-chase music.  The beats     rattle, the bass seethes, the flutes and strings screech like Blaxploitation crossed with the cheap urgency of an Italian zombie     movie.  But what's scariest and most exhilarating is how, for all the track's runaway train momentum, it feels inexorable, implacable,     utterly in control of itself.  Rakim's delivery of the final verse may be the most exciting-- at least in terms of breath control--     slice of rap the genre has yet delivered. (And no, Twista doesn't count.)</p>
<p>""Microphone Fiend"" rattled sleigh bells harder than anyone until Pete Rock showed up, and the stabbing dynamics of the guitar sample     harassed the ear something awful. The chopper blade beats of ""Lyrics of Fury"" almost render the genre it would help to inspire (jungle)     redundant.   In this era, when almost all rap was ""fast rap,"" tracks like these and ""The R"" were the roughneck alternative to a     burgeoning hip-house, beats impacting your body as your mind swam at the density of words.  Unfortunately, by the time they released     <i>Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em</i>, an attempt to extend the deft simplicity of their debut, in 1990, they were already old news. (Perhaps     best exemplified by the cover of 1992's <i>Don't Sweat the Technique.)  Deposed kings before they'd even hit their 30s, they've     limped through the ensuing decade about which the most that can be said is that they didn't scuff up their legacy too much.</i></p>
<p>These reissues add a handful of remixes (two on <i>Paid</i>, three on <i>Leader</i>), none essential.  The only criminal inclusion     is a truncated version of Coldcut's remix of ""Paid in Full"" rather than the full seven minutes of madness.  (But whatever, it's     overrated anyway.)  The covers-- with their gold anchor chains, manhole medallions, and customized Dapper Dan jackets-- are a nice     rebuke to anyone who thinks conspicuous consumption is a new-school disease.

He will not acknowledge the term ""folktronica"" in casual conversation.
    And he will most certainly not prattle on about Bruce Springsteen using his song ""Slow Jam"" (humorously mislabeled as ""Slow Burn"" on
    the Boss' official site) as walk-out music for the Devils &amp; Dust Tour. After the minor success of his third solo full-length, 2003's
    <em>Rounds, it seems like a good old-fashioned bout of rebellion is in order.</em></p><p>
    
    With <em>Rounds, Hebden created a blissful blend of his small-time, insular sound-swirls and bold-face beats. Accordingly,
    Radiohead, Beth Orton, and Super Furry Animals commissioned remixes, and even some non-nerds started to pay attention.  But
    apparently Hebden isn't totally comfortable with his music filling the ""chill"" role at a progressive frat house's latest
    hackey-sack soiree.  </em><em>Everything Ecstatic</em> sees the sunken-eyed Brit forgoing the lullaby instrumentation and straightforward
    rhythms of its predecessor for a darker, more intricate sound-- one rooted more in chaotic free jazz than skewed folk.  While
    this stylistic move is admirable, though, it sometimes sacrifices Hebden's more accessible melodic gifts in its quest for fresh
    ideas.</p><p>
    
    Whereas the amplified thump of a human heart gave <em>Rounds an instant corporeal quality, <i>Ecstatic</i></em> opens on the back of
    a harsh, scraping bass loop. The low growl remains constant throughout ""A Joy"" as an army of programmed snares nimbly cross over
    each other before the organized noise dissolves into a computerized Jim O'Rourke-style cacophony of screeching bells, other-worldly
    whistles, and an overarching sense of many computers crashing at the exact same time. The tattered beginning is an adequate primer
    to <em>Ecstatic's scruffier palette.</em></p><p>
    
    The slow-building ""Sun Drums and Soil"" is the album's strongest example of Hebden's Ornette-Coleman-meets-Sun-Ra direction. Near
    tribal drums build an underworld base for the song to snake out from. Keyboard lines wrap around each other as radio static muddies
    the mid-song breakdown. What sound like distant, effected vocals conjure another set of crushing drums and, eventually, a wonderfully
    wailing saxophone bleats, furthering the fury. Haunting, challenging and ultimately rewarding, the raucous track sees Hebden letting
    his freakout-flag fly, but not everything on <em>Ecstatic</em> is so dense.</p><p>
    
    The languid ""And Then Patters"" harkens back to <em>Rounds' lush simplicity, while the jubilant ""Smile Around the Face"" may be the
    closest Hebden's ever come to an in-the-flesh pop song. The rinky-dink hi-hats keep it playful as Hebden puts his phaser effect to
    use, employing washes of synths that cut in and out across the speakers. But the track's unique, irresistible calling card is a
    sped-up vocal sample lifted straight out of Kanye West's Louis Vuitton backpack. The happy-chipmunk loop sticks and Hebden justly
    milks it, adorning the track with a multitude of additional sonic drips and fluffy atmospherics. Undeniably catchy and unabashedly
    cheerful, ""Smile Around the Face"" attests to Hebden's appealingly child-like anything-goes quality.</em></p><p>
    
    On the flipside of that fresh-breeze highlight is ""Turtle Turtle Up"", a two-minute jumble of vintage video game blips and pummeling
    drums that comes off as an in-process demo. The lackluster tune is followed-up by the BPM-bumping dancefloor clear-out ""Sleep, Eat
    Food, Have Visions"", near the end of the album. The eight-minute epic sees Hebden recreating the beat-busting portion of his live
    show where he gradually turns the speed knob all the way up until just a sheet of sound remains, which he toys with accordingly.
    The trick works in concert thanks to his improvisational tact and resourcefulness, but when nailed down on record, the technique
    becomes laborious.</p><p>
    
    Taking into account his recent impressive <em>Madvillain</em> remixes and the forthcoming album he's producing for Beth Orton, it
    seems like Hebden may be using his Four Tet albums to further his stylistic reach so he can apply his sound to more typically
    song-based collaborations. And more power to him. <em>Everything Ecstatic</em> marks his first slight step backward as a solo artist
    but it's hardly a failure. Like a natural jazz improviser flailing about in search of the precise moment to let loose a flurry of
    inspired notes, Hebden consistently sticks his neck out every which way here, knowing full well it may be chopped off at any moment.</p></div>"|3168.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3168-everything-ecstatic/|7.4|Ryan Dombal

    the Grand Royal label, solely on the merit of an orgiastic live show and word-of-mouth.  Then, just as they began to approach
    commercial success, they dissolved without a fuss-- not even offering their fans a reason why-- and immediately split into two
    separate bands that rode the wave of their impact.</p><p>
    
    The point of releasing an At the Drive-In anthology now seems obvious: A convenient and tidy package for lazier consumers would not
    only benefit them commercially, but could double as a career overview for Mars Volta fans curious about the more modest beginnings
    of their favorite prog-rock behemoths.  <em>This Station Is Non-Operational</em> ignores both routes.  Not quite a best-of collection,
    some of the band's strongest songs (and indeed, even some singles, like ""Invalid Litter Dept."") are ignored by a tracklist that
    offers a snapshot of the band's artistic growth, from class-act emo to muscular modern rock.  That's a kick in the pants if you're
    looking to drop cash on one comprehensive ATDI release, but anyone with a broadband connection and a computer can create their own
    hits comp; <em>This Station</em> aims to be a retrospective in the true sense of the word, while also providing enough extras to make
    it a worthwhile package for longtime fans.</p><p>
    
    Tracks 1-11 provides a tidy time capsule of the band's seven years together; the remaining seven cuts give us a peek at the band's
    influences and creative growing pains.  Culled primarily from singles and split 7-inches, the latter portion of the disc is comprised
    of two covers, one remix, one live favorite, and three B-sides.  The Smiths' ""This Night Has Opened My Eyes"" is a surprising choice
    for the band, but they play it straight, more or less, with only some added dual-guitar interplay and a touch of distortion.  The
    compilation ends on a light-hearted note with another curious choice, Pink Floyd's ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk""-- perhaps
    an early sign of their itch for more intricate songcraft.</p><p>
    
    As for the four B-sides, there's little worth seeking out, and two of them are particularly unrewarding: ""Incentardis"" thrashes hard
    but never finds a hook, while ""Doorman's Placebo"" is basically a limp emo track lacking rhythm and energy.  The other two are no more
    engaging-- ""Autorelocator"" is a plodding, directionless electronic experiment, and the Latch Bros. remix of ""Rascuache"" turns the
    band into a dub-inflected version of Cornershop-- but are mildly compelling curios, as they feel like necessary missteps leading to
    the subtle electronic touches of the band's later sound.  Of course, these tracks weren't included in this package to serve as
    revelations; they're simply footnotes to the story told by the first 11 tracks.</p><p>
    
    Whether through label differences or the band's own will, At the Drive-In's earliest EPs and first full-length, <em>Acrobatic Tenement</em>,
    are completely unrepresented here (unless you count the BBC performance of ""Initiation"" tacked onto the end).  ""Fahrenheit"" and
    ""Picket Fence Cartel"" are taken from the <em>El Gran Orgo</em> EP, and pick up on the emo blueprint laid out by a handful of mid-80s
    Dischord bands (most notably Rites of Spring), but add sharp, unpredictable rhythms and exuberant shout-along hooks, all led by
    Cedric Bixler's unmistakable Ozzy-esque caterwauls.</p><p>
    
    The four songs taken from the economical <em>In Casino Out</em> continue in the same vein, though the band stretches the formula a bit
    further.  ""Lopsided"" features galloping rhythms and clean guitar that proved the band were equally potent with the distortion dialed
    down, and ""Pickpocket"" never relents from its streamlined thrashing.  ""Chanabra"" adds bongos to one of the disc's most aggressive
    choruses, hinting at future recordings.  And ""Napoleon Solo"" is a whisper/scream tribute to two friends of the band, fellow musicians
    from their hometown of El Paso, who died in a car accident while ATDI was on tour.</p><p>
    
    ATDI hit their stride on the <em>Vaya</em> EP, and two of its songs are included here.  Coming off their previous records, ""Metronome
    Arthritis"" feels like the work of a different band entirely: Atmospheric guitar scrapes add static to a slow, druggy groove, and
    meandering guitar lines precede a crunching chorus led by Bixler's true-crime paranoia (""What if forensics finds the answer?/ What
    if they stole my fingerprints?/ Where did I leave my book of matches?/ We'll find you..."") and a highly melodic guitar lead.  ""198d"",
    on the other hand, stretches the whisper/scream dynamic to its breaking point, squeezing out a final drop of surprise.  But after
    sharpening their skills and working with nu-metal guru Ross Robinson and Andy Wallace, the songs on <em>Relationship of Command</em>
    are what thrust them into the mainstream.</p><p>
    
    The inclusion of their biggest single, ""One-Armed Scissor"", is a no-brainer.  It's almost a summation of everything that made ATDI
    great: the tick-tock rhythmic interplay and quivering bass of the verses flashed their chops as musicians, and its infamous stop/start
    chorus riff and shouted ""cut ah-way!"" hook that could still slice through the airwaves today.  It took the cock out of cock-rock but
    retained the molar-grinding testosterone, while finding room for emo histrionics, a psychedelic detour, and a great punk rock scream
    from the whole band. ""Non-Zero Possibility"" puts mood over matter, and though it's a successful diversion with diverse instrumentation,
    I'd take nearly any track on <em>Relationship of Command</em> over it.  Perhaps it's an apt finale, being the closing track on their
    final album.  ""Enfilade"" is more like it, merging the band's disparate influences perfectly: The ominous Cure-inspired rock and
    snapping drum machines of the verses (not unlike the opening of ""Arc Arsenal"") with more of Bixler's cloak-and-dagger lyrics, and
    a bongo-driven detour that shows off drummer Tony Hijada's diversity and nods to the group's Latin influences-- a calm-before-the-storm
    just before a perfect fist-pumping, shout-along chorus.</p><p>
    
    While the performances on <em>Relationship of Command</em> were overwhelmingly reckless, At the Drive-In's go-for-broke attitude cut
    both ways: Guitarist Jim Ward was quoted as saying, ""As soon as one of us gets tired of doing this, if it's in the middle of [an]
    interview or in the middle of a tour, that's it.  We're done.""  And on the verge of conquering radio and selling nearly a million
    copies of that record, they kept their promise.  ""Relentless"" wasn't even the word for their touring schedule since forming in 1994--
    their work ethic was certifiably insane, as they didn't even take a day off for the tragedy interpreted in ""Napoleon Solo"", and
    cancelled only two dates after their own van accident in 2000.  The lyrics of ""One-Armed Scissor"" paraphrase the isolation of the
    band's first few tours together while foreshadowing their end-- even one of its ominous lyrics make for this compilation's title.
    The lyrics on <em>Relationship of Command</em> might be oblique, but a message isn't hard to discern; after a non-stop seven-year
    tour/record/tour schedule, each song seems like a desperate S.O.S.</p><p>
    
    Now that the dust has settled, the fans have moved on, and its members have recast themselves in their new bands, the press has
    readily accepted At the Drive-In offshoots Sparta as being ""accessible"" and The Mars Volta ""difficult"", but the push/pull between
    the two extremes within the songs on <em>This Station Is Non-Operational</em> is seamless.  This anthology begs the question: Why
    should rock fans have to settle for one or the other?</p></div>"|330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/330-this-station-is-non-operational/|8.3|Jason Crock

That said I'm assuming the title comes from some mystical British sailing tale, like everything else the Coral do. With their spastic, psychedelic debut garnering them Best New Band tags from the praise-happy </em><em>NME, and the Strokes, Hives, and White Stripes collectively buttering up America's 60s rock palette, big things seemed to await the Coral in the States. Unfortunately, they were sent back to the UK with their tails between their legs.</em></p><p>
    On their third album the Coral have reverted to a subdued and almost jaded sound-- <em>Invisible Invasion reveals way too many wrinkles and stretch marks for a band barely into their twenties. About the only surviving aspect of their vigorous debut is a laundry list of psychedelic and 60s influences. ""Cripples Crown"" plods along with frontman James Skelly sounding like a disturbingly sober, and bored, Jim Morrison. With its rigid chord progression and reverb-drenched harmonies, ""A Warning to the Curious"" borrows heavily from the more crestfallen Zombies numbers while folk-pop ditty ""Leaving Today"" strives for Byrds-style wholesomeness.</em></p><p>
    Some songs have a pulse of their own, though, such as organ-driven stomper ""The Operator"" and the trippy, mysterious ""She Sings the Mourning"". However, any élan exuded by the openings of these tracks quickly succumbs to Skelly's haggard vocals, which are still stuck on the drowsy <em>Magic &amp; Medicine</em> setting. Even when the band gives him a kick in the pants, like on pounding rocker ""Something Inside of Me"", Skelly's croon is barely beyond speaking level, further proof, sadly, that the Coral's enthusiasm peaked with their excellent 2001 single ""Dreaming of You"".</p><p>
    Perhaps this band's saving grace is their immaculate duplication of 60s pop-- the entire album seems predicated on the first minute of ""Light my Fire"". Perhaps if the Coral start aspiring for a 60s sound more intricate than the <em>Austin Powers soundtracks they'll carve their own niche in the mercurial retro scene. Until then, these ancient mariners are being kept afloat by British press hype.</em></p></div>"|1605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1605-invisible-invasion/|6.0|Adam Moerder

Both partners operate their own micro-labels-- Olson with his American Tapes imprint and O'Rourke co-manages Polyamory-- and have previously released umpteen Dead Machines works in tiny editions in virtually every format imaginable, as well as a 2004 full-length LP on Ecstatic Peace.</em></p><p>
    
    Even so, this album has the feel of a comprehensive introduction, as its five extended, untitled tracks completely immerse the listener in the duo's seemingly unmapped wasteland of manipulated feedback, hissing static, and hot-wired electronics. It's an intense, uncompromising exhibition; one that's sure to tantalize veteran noise hedonists (who can certainly feel free to mentally adjust the above rating upwards a couple clicks) but is unlikely to recruit many new converts to the cause.</p><p>
    
    Departing somewhat from the punk-bred approach of Wolf Eyes and their unkempt Midwestern kin, Dead Machines here generally forgo the metal-inflected, doom-laden shriek of acts like Merzbow or Kevin Drumm in favor of cleaner, more diffuse abstractions whose ambient, eerily detached pulsations are at times reminiscent of such electronic minimalists as Kazunao Nagata and others from Japan's Zero Gravity label. If Wolf Eyes can occasionally sound like an squad of robots armed with band-saws descending upon a crowded cattleyard, Dead Machines instead favor the sound of those same robots lying prone in a state of decay, their batteries corroded, their circuit boards shorted and crackling.</p><p>
    
    On first pass, the album's progression sounds almost arbitrary, as each track cycles through a virtually untraceable series of sputtering audio waves and tortured mechanical clatter in a manner that suggests little intervention by its human operators. Upon repeat listens, however, patterns begin to emerge reluctantly from the squall, and though it's probably inaccurate to suggest that <em>Futures contains much in the way of an organized structure, the album does reveal the duo's recognizable fingerprints as they intuitively shape the music's unstable, textured contours.</em></p><p>
    
    This sense of distinctive individual authorship is crucial to the album's appeal, as without it the duo's sound risks becoming overwhelmingly sterile and faceless. If there's a central dissonance at the core of the Dead Machines experience it stems from their creation of these carefully hand-crafted audio artifacts that too often sound as though they could've been created by anyone in possession of the same busted equipment, or even independently of human musicians altogether. And I suspect it's this conflict that will, for too many listeners, make <em>Futures feel like more of an impenetrable wall than a doorway.</em></p></div>"|2612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2612-futures/|6.4|Matthew Murphy

It's not a smirk or a simper or even a smile-- it's a full-on grin. Bathed in a golden hue, the image is an instant-vintage snapshot of the sincerity and canny idealism that has marked Common's 13-year hip-hop career. As other MCs fall by the conscious curbside due to nascent acting careers (Mos Def, Andre 3000) or misguided mainstream pleas (Talib Kweli, the Roots), this Chicago native rebounds from 2002's botched hip-hop-flower-child experiment <em>Electric Circus</em> with the help of fellow Windy City native Kanye West on <em>Be</em>, which comfortably ranks alongside <em>Resurrection</em> and <em>Like Water for Chocolate</em> as Common's best work to date.</p><p>  The album introduces itself with a few somber, contemplative notes from an upright bass. Then the heavy strings awake from their slumber and start popping. A slurring analog keyboard line slides in. Juke joint piano begins to roll. ""Yes,"" Common says with a resounding confidence that instantly placates any holdover <em>Electric Circus</em> worries. Elevated by the melodic burst of the quintessential West beat, Common proceeds to dole out his State of Urban America Address: ""Bush pushin' lies/ Killers immortalized/ We got arms but won't reach for the skies."" With no hook and a cold Chi-town setting where ""drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones,"" <em>Be</em>'s intro is inviting, stern, buoyant, and level-headed all at once, establishing a theme of restrained optimism.</p><p>  It's deftly followed by the crack-a-lack street symphony ""The Corner"".  ""We write songs about wrong because it's hard to see right,"" Common intones, alongside his legendary heroes the Last Poets.  Guided by the tenants of his classic hip-hop parable ""I Used to Love H.E.R."", the wise MC is not preaching, just leisurely speaking, playing the world-weary yet still-hopeful ghetto documentarian. Still gazing into his daughter's eyes for inspiration as he did on <em>Like Water for Chocolate</em>'s ""The 6th Sense"", Common, at the near-ancient hip-hop age of 33, refreshingly looks to generations both past and future for the answers to the big questions he's searching for on <em>Be</em>.</p><p>  Nowadays, Common won't leave you slack-jawed at his meta-metaphor verbal gymnastics. His flow is slowed and smoothed out, with understated emphasis and emotion taking the place of young-buck flashiness. The lack of instant-gratification couplets may disappoint at first, but each verse's rewarding intricacies become more evident with multiple listens.</p><p>  Sonically, <em>Be</em> is utterly listenable: With just 11 songs in 42 minutes (including Pop's rap), the record is as succinct as its title. <em>Be</em>'s brevity is not only welcomed but almost iconoclastic. Making the album speed by even faster is the intrinsic sense of continuity provided by West and the like-minded J Dilla. The famed dropout's nine tracks feature his signature sound with slight unconventional arrangement twists and scratch-down turns that prevent dull uniformity: Instead of a third verse on the two-sided adulterous saga ""Faithful"", the song segues into a celestial duet with John Legend tethered to the hook while wily eccentric Bilal soars above with his melismatic vocal theatrics.</p><p>  Once a pupil of Chicago producer No I.D., who helped construct Common's early boom-bap sound, West does his mentor proud on <em>Be</em>, exuberantly pushing his one-time lyrical foe to unleash superior oratory skills while cutting-and-pasting archaic soul samples from forgotten artists such as gospel-tinged loverman DJ Rogers (""Faithful"") and familial funk group Cornelius Brothers &amp; Sister Rose (""Chi City""). Aside from the horn-laden ""Real People"", which nicks 70s organist Caesar Frazier's ""Sweet Children"" wholesale, West once again proves himself to be an inventive, natural talent behind the boards, as on ""The Food,"" which flips the opening notes of Sam Cooke's ""Nothing Can Change This Love"" for its infectious piano loop.</p><p>  There are no skippable songs on <em>Be</em>, but one decision disrupts the album's admirably consistent 68-degrees-in-the-shade vibe: The inclusion of the ""Chappelle's Show"" version of ""The Food"". Though the live take has an intensity missing on the studio version (released on vinyl last year), the Chappelle introduction and opening and closing applause pull the listener out of <em>Be</em>'s palpable Southside surroundings. The album would have been better served by a redone studio take on the tune, which had the potential to be one of <em>Be</em>'s finest.</p><p>  Picayune flaws aside, the album's appeal stems from Common's passionate honesty. This invigorating trait means ballads like ""Love Is..."" and ""It's Your World"" don't melt into mush. The former sees him talking tender over a sinuous J Dilla beat that layers airy Marvin Gaye vocal samples atop each other to sublime effect. ""Some say that I'm a dreamer because I talk about it often/ Seen the hardest nigga soften with his homey in a coffin,"" he says, admitting his romantic weaknesses while concurrently highlighting the inevitable downsides of such boundless affections. The latter features an unflinching, detailed narrative chronicling a downtrodden Midwestern prostitute's sympathetic plight: ""I remember in high school, she had a passion to sing/ Now she see herself in her casket in dreams.""</p><p>  The woman's tale can be seen as a dreadful sequel to hip-hop's own plight in ""I Used to Love H.E.R."" More than a decade after that distillation of the pitfalls of the culture, hip-hop continues to relish in the violent and abusive tropes at an increasingly overt level. Still, Common lends power and self-worth to the character in ""It's Your World"", hoping she can use it to her advantage-- but also realizing her fate may be sealed. ""She still wanna see California,"" he concludes. Whether she ever makes it is left lovingly, realistically unanswered.</p><p> </p></div>"|1566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1566-be/|8.6|Ryan Dombal

But while they may have been the biggest, they were far from the best.  Hell, Oasis weren't even the best Britpop band.  It's as though they succeeded solely by their own notorious conviction that they were the Beatles' rightful successors.</p><p>But all things end, and as the bloated <em>Be Here Now</em> hit stores in 1997 at the height of their popularity, they settled in for the backlash, which, eight years later, is still in full force.  Or close to it, anyway-- I've read several write-ups of their latest album, <em>Don't Believe the Truth</em>, that struggle to explain why it's a return to form from their last two miscarriages, <em>Standing on the Shoulder of Giants</em> and <em>Heathen Chemistry</em>.  Unfortunately, these reviews are either based on wishful thinking or plain bad taste.  If anything, <em>Don't Believe the Truth</em> is the chilling conclusion to their discography's trilogy of shame.</p><p>  It's difficult to define what a return to form would be for Oasis.  In hindsight, <em>Definitely Maybe</em> and <em>(What's the Story) Morning Glory</em> aren't much more than competent albums that managed to score a handful of genuinely triumphant, anthemic singles-- and <em>Don't Believe the Truth</em> certainly falls well short of the high-water mark those records set for the band.  A decidedly scattershot affair, the new record only exceeds the sum of its parts for a few fleeting moments.</p><p> There are a lot of reasons this album doesn't gel, not least that Liam Gallagher now sounds like a singing anti-smoking campaign, and the brash, snotty arrogance that once sold ""Cigarettes and Alcohol"" and ""Champagne Supernova"" is crushed out by his gruffness. When brother Noel sings (which he often does), he's so obviously dispassionate about the project that he seems to disappear completely. Worse still, the band's non-Gallaghers are content to act as tired session musicians, even when they're writing the songs. Gem Archer wrote one and Andy Bell contributed two, but you'd never know without the liners, as they're totally indistinguishable from Noel's uninspired castoffs. Weirdly, the track that seems least like a Noel tune is actually one he wrote: ""Part of the Queue"" sounds like something off Doves' <em>Lost Souls</em>, if not quite up to that band's standards.</p><p>  ""Mucky Fingers"" is also a relative departure for the band, sounding roughly like the Velvet Underground's ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" stripped of all personality and topicality.  Not that topicality has ever been an Oasis strength.  They've always leaned on ambiguity and the easy rhyme in their lyrics (I suppose in the reach for universality), and there's no indication that's going to change.  Check Liam's ""Love Like a Bomb"", where he does his best John Lennon while sneering the decidedly un-Lennonesque lines, ""You turn me on/ Your love's like a bomb/ Blowin' my mind.""</p><p>  Thankfully, they've tossed in a couple of worthwhile tracks to salvage the record from the junkheap, chief among them ""The Importance of Being Idle"", which, though never quite as promising as its title suggests, has a pleasant music hall bounce to it and one of Noel's better vocals.  Liam's ""Guess God Thinks I'm Abel"", meanwhile, offers a rare instance of Oasis handing us a melody rather than slamming us over the head with it-- and it even shockingly refrains from capitalizing on the title's obvious pun, a huge plus.  Sadly, strong melodies are in short supply elsewhere on <em>Don't Believe the Truth</em>, and what little they've drudged up are largely sunk by utilitarian arrangements.</p><p>  Incidentally, you may have heard that Ringo Starr's kid, Zak Starkey, has become a member of Oasis for this record.  It's a great publicity stunt for the band, and it's even partly true-- Starkey contributed his drumwork to a couple of these tracks (the rest are hammered out by faceless session dudes).  The presence of Beatle offspring at the kid, however, only heightens the surrealism of Oasis' idol worship, and does nothing for them musically.</p><p>  So I suppose, in the end, the best that can be said of <em>Don't Believe the Truth</em> is that it is a slight improvement over their previous two studio efforts, and that they at least had the sense to scrap the recordings they made with Death in Vegas and return to a simpler, more traditional sound.  But regrettably, their adherence to what they do best only helps so much: When I found out that Oasis had a new album on the way, my reaction was ""they're still together?""  I still can hardly believe it, and given their disinterested performances here, it would seem neither can they.</p></div>"|8982.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8982-dont-believe-the-truth/|4.7|Joe Tangari

    Scenes, New Pornographers, Constantines, Black Mountains, and, yes,
    Avrils, but in the mid-1990s, being Canadian and not named Alanis or
    Shania was enough to get you dropped from your label. Playing quintessential power-pop while signed to grunge-oriented major
    Geffen didn't help. At any rate, Sloan's lack of U.S. commercial
    success in the 1990s represents the nadir of U.S.-Canuck relations
    between ""54 40 or Fight!"" and that government official calling Dubya
    a ""moron"" in 2002-- yeah, I'm including ""Informer"".</p><p>
<em>A Sides Win</em> captures most of the high points along this
    Halifax, Nova Scotia-based quartet's career arc and adds two adequate
    new songs, all in the blessedly sensible chronological order too many
    singles comps eschew. Representing 1993 debut <em>Smeared</em>, the
    ambitiously geeky ""Underwhelmed"" and dreamy ""500 Up"" open the record,
    distending the band's typical hook-filled melodies with swirling
    guitars that hint at both Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine. 1994
    follow-up <em>Twice Removed</em> yields the concentrated melodic O.J. of
    ""Coax Me""-- ""it's not the band I hate, it's their fans!""-- and dull
    post-shoegaze ""People of the Sky"". This is where Sloan began to carve
    out their niche as a power-pop band, and also where their chances for
    American stardom were squandered amid Geffen's lack of marketing
    support.</p><p>
    
    Sloan's crowning achievement remains 1996's gloriously catchy <em>One
    Chord to Another</em>, which fulfilled its predecessor's promise with
    punchy tunes indebted to Graham Nash-era Hollies and, of course, that
    Fabbest of Fours. Unsurprisingly, tracks from that album are <em>A
    Sides Win</em>'s peak. ""The Lines You Amend"" jangles like ""The Ballad
    of John &amp; Yoko"" while name-dropping Ringo. ""Everything You've Done
    Wrong"" skips along to handclaps and trumpets far sunnier than its
    title. ""The Good in Everyone"" concisely summarizes Sloan's style,
    anchoring sunny British Invasion harmonies in crunchy power chords.</p><p>
    
    While most of the tracks taken from Sloan's subsequent four studio
    albums reflect the band's descent into clunky riff-rock that owes as
    much to AC/DC and KISS as to power-pop icons like Big Star or Zumpano,
    <em>Pretty Together</em>'s ""The Other Man"" is a glistening alt-rocker
    supposedly inspired by bassist Chris Murphy's inserting himself (ahem)
    between Broken Social Scene's Andrew Whiteman and Canadian songstress
    Feist. O indie Canada!</p><p>
    
    Sloan are a better singles band than an albums band, so <em>A Sides
    Win</em> all but atones for their sometimes underwhelming (ha!)
    latter-day failings. Even 2003's <em>Action Pact</em> sounds brilliant
    when its sole inclusion is jaunty, contemplative ""The Rest of My
    Life"". The two new songs don't exactly hint at a renaissance, but at
    least they show a band still rummaging for new classic rock
    inspiration-- the Cars-like palm-muting and synths of ""Try to Make
    It"", the can't-drive-just-55 riff-churner ""All Used Up"". All that
    said, listeners just discovering Sloan would still be better off
    buying <em>One Chord to Another</em>.</p></div>"|7250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7250-a-sides-win-singles-1992-2005/|7.9|Marc Hogan

    as measured and deliberate as a high-flying gull stroking through a
    cloudless sky. There are plenty of indie rockers thumbing spectral ambiance from their
    keyboards, but no one is doing it with the same level of restraint and
    precision as Jimmy LaValle. Nevertheless, the field is over-saturated,
    and it's a given that this record will strike impatient listeners as
    tedious. LaValle is working from a familiar palette here-- each song
    finds layers of wavering drone shot through with sparse yet complexly
    ramifying mechanical drums, long arcs of simple, chiming leads and
    trembling strings wafting over resonant slabs of melodic bass. Point
    blank, if you're not in the right headspace for this stuff, it's going
    to bore no matter how well done. But if you are, LaValle's spare,
    translucent brushstrokes seem like an elemental and ideal expression
    of the form.</p><p>
    Originally released in Spain, on Acuarela Records, in 2003, this
    Stateside reissue is fleshed out with new violin parts, a rare track
    (""For Jonathan""), and five previously unreleased live tracks with
    Sigur Rós sitting in, making for a whopping 10-track EP. And since the only real difference between LaValle's live and studio recordings is that the live ones have applause at the end, his elegant
    sonic calculus has a seamless placidity and cinematic gravity that
    allows for complete immersion.</p><p>
    The ease of immersion makes the <em>Seal Beach EP</em> such a
    lulling siren song, and this is credit to LaValle's
    self-control. Indie electronica has developed a familiar dynamic-- start in tranquility, then ratchet up the drums and synths in crisp
    shifts of intensity until the track is galloping and hiccupping like a
    drunken mechanical bull. LaVelle doesn't succumb to the bombastic
    urge, and his ephemeral webs stretch out with a serene, meditative
    profundity unbroken by the non-linear impulse. Nor does he feel the
    need to tack superfluous noises onto his pale watercolor washes,
    having the confidence to let the bare essentials of song stand alone,
    ebbing and flowing as naturally as the tide. From the flaring static,
    whirring drums and contrapuntal clicktrack of ""Malmo"", to the gently
    wailing violins and pirouetting synths of ""Brennivin"", to the briskly
    accruing acoustic guitar arpeggios of ""One Minute"", <em>Seal Beach EP</em> comprises a summer jam for the North Pole, and the Album Leaf
    continues to set the pace for those who would politely drone.</p></div>"|102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/102-seal-beach-ep/|7.6|Brian Howe

He's been writing 
    songs since the age of 17 and likely drinking for longer than that. 
    <em>We Can Breathe Under Alcohol</em> is the group's second album, and from 
    just looking at the title and tracklist, alcohol is a recurring theme. 
    While countless songwriters have drawn inspiration from the bottle, Anaya shies away from romanticizing a bad habit-- but nor does he 
    reveal any telling anecdotes, epiphanies, or underlying morals. We just 
    know he drinks. Like, a lot. The lyrics move from the cheap 
    camaraderie of friends sitting at a bar (""Green Water"") to reaching a David 
    Brent-level of awkward confrontation (""Angry Drunk"", which repeats ""My 
    parents think my drinking is becoming an issue"" ad nauseam) that reveal 
    nothing about Anaya or the ""characters"" he's writing about.</p><p>
     
    Arrangements are this record's saving grace. Compare the 
    sparse acoustics of ""Whales Talk Whales Walk"" or ""St. Augustine"" to the horn 
    section on ""Change the World"", the strings on ""Angry Drunk"", or the 
    dash of piano near the end of ""Green Water"" (in a pretty direct nod to 
    Elliot Smith's ""Son of Sam""). They may not be daring additions, but 
    they're nice aesthetic touches that show off the band's musicianship. They also take some of the focus from Anaya's vocals, reminiscent of 
    another young prodigy whose name begins with a ""C"" and ends in ""onor 
    Oberst."" But given the diversity of sounds on <em>We Can Breathe...</em>, it's 
    a tolerable affectation, providing Anaya isn't stretching the word 
    ""light"" into five syllables just to fit the rhyme scheme (""White Horse"").</p><p>
    
    There's one more mantra on this record that gets almost as much lyrical 
    attention as alcohol, which is: ""Fuck the indie music scene."" The 
    ""scene"" is taken to task not just once, but on four different songs. 
    Is that supposed to be provocative? Defiant? Maybe I'm taking the 
    bait here, but might they be shooting themselves in the foot just a 
    bit, considering <em>We Can Breathe...</em> sounds like a senior thesis in 
    the Bright Eyes School of Vocal Delivery? More importantly, is the 
    ""indie scene"" important enough to be juxtaposed against television, the NRA, 
    the Capitol building, and the Iraq War in the lyrics to a supposed 
    protest song (""Change the world"")? Yes, indie rock must be stopped at all 
    costs-- It's the wrong scene at the wrong time! No Blood for White Guys 
    with Guitars! More than just over-earnestness and a whiff of hypocrisy, 
    it's narrow perspective than sinks an otherwise adequate indie rock 
    record.</p><p>
    
    What lingers with me the most is the final moments of the acoustic 
    closing track ""St. Augustine"": When Anaya arrives at the final chorus, he 
    calls to his background singers, ""We need some help...so let's sing for 
    peace!"" After which, his monotone ""la-la-la's"" can barely be heard 
    above the crowd. If Anaya can't be bothered to raise his voice, how can 
    anyone be expected to sing along?</p></div>"|474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/474-we-can-breathe-under-alcohol/|4.3|Jason Crock

Kate notes how ""he looked her in the eyes/ Just like a boy of 19 would do."" And even though Martha is facing someone who is a stranger, relative, and musical forebear, ""she was not afraid/No, she was not afraid."" It's only one of innumerable songs the Wainwright clan has written about each other, but nine years later, ""Matapedia"" sounds particularly prescient. Martha Wainwright's fearlessness has not abated with age, but has found an outlet in the family business.</p><p>
    
    Like her parents and brother, Martha writes candidly and often hostilely about the people around her, be they lovers, friends, or family. She has her father's name (as well as an album cover that mimics his 1975 <em>Unrequited), is blessed with her mother's gracefully lilting voice, and borrows her older brother Rufus's witty frankness. She generally composes in the 70s folk singer-songwriter mode: Every song seems to have originated with only her voice and acoustic guitar. Some songs remain in this bare-bones state, but she elaborates on most tracks with enough rock, pop, and even country elements that they never sound like exercises in nostalgia.</em></p><p>
    
    But it's her lyrics and vocals that are the focus of this debut. Martha doesn't write hooks so much as she inflects them with a versatile voice that moves fluidly from intimate exhalations (""Don't Forget"") to angry exhortations (""Ball &amp; Chain"") to florid cascades of backing oohs and aahs (""Far Away""). The refrain of ""Factory""-- ""I'll take the coast from factory to factory""-- remains in your head not because of the words' inherent rhythms, but because Martha rushes the first two, draws out the long o in ""coast,"" then rushes the last phrase as her voice rises excitably.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, she has a penchant for sly wordplay and frank confession, addressing romantic masochism and what she calls ""sexual psychology"" in ""Ball &amp; Chain"". But her forthrightness can be highly deceptive. On ""TV Show"", she sings, ""So when you touch me there I'm scared you'll see/ Not the way that I don't love you/ But the way I don't love myself."" Deciphering those double negatives couldn't be more difficult: On first listen, it sounds like she loves the song's subject, but hates herself, but that extra ""don't"" between the ""I"" and the ""love you"" muddies the meaning. It's all a question of syntax, yet that one extra word thoroughly complicates the song while directly, even intimately involving the listener in her drama.</p><p>
    
    Of course, family plays a strong role on these songs. In addition to appearances by Kate (playing banjo on ""Factory"" and piano on ""Don't Forget"") and Rufus (singing on ""The Maker""), she writes about their tumultuous family with a candor that would be more remarkable if it weren't a genetic trait. Martha's song about her father is called ""Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole"", and the pun of the title in no way detracts from the cathartic defiance of the lyrics: ""I will not pretend/ I will not put on a smile/ I will not say I'm all right for you."" Yet, despite the endless comparisons these family dramas provoke, Martha Wainwright proves Martha Wainwright has a strong, distinct, fully formed musical identity, which would be just as impressive by any other name.</p></div>"|8789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8789-martha-wainwright/|7.8|Stephen M.

The world at
    large viewed him out of the corner of its eye throughout much of his life, fully realizing what it had lost when hundreds of thousands of
    people turned up at his funeral. Since that year, intrepid reissue labels, DJs, and archivists (not mention MCA/Universal) have leapt
    headfirst into the kaleidoscopic world of modern African music, turning up hundreds of lost and little-known recordings. The excavation and
    display of vintage Afropop has been a treat for anyone who likes a good beat, though, and I suppose this makes Gilles Peterson's foray into
    Africa inevitable.</p><p>
    Peterson is a venerable DJ and label owner, champion of a broad definition of dance music, and something of a tastemaker, who, according to
    the liners of this two-disc mix, first got into Fela and Manu Dibango back in the 80s. Gerry Lyseight's liners also try to subtly imply that
    Peterson himself has unearthed the Peter King and Letta Mbulu tracks included here, though I bet Russ Dewbury would have something to say
    about that. The oddest thing about <i>Gilles Peterson in Africa</i> is how far from the cutting edge it feels-- there's little here among the
    vintage tracks that I haven't heard before, presented more congruously on some other release, and a few of the remixes he includes on the
    second disc aren't terribly interesting or even au currant.</p><p>
    That's not to say Peterson hasn't gathered a bunch of killer tracks. After a brief ""Intro"" (which is actually nicked from Oneness of Juju's
    ""African Rhythms""), Peterson drops Oscar Sulley &amp; the Uhuru Dance Band's astounding big-band funk cut ""Bukom Mashie"", a long-unreleased track
    that's deservedly made the rounds of Afrobeat compilations since Soundway's Miles Cleret dusted it off a few years ago for <em>Ghana
    Soundz. It's an outstanding track with a dive-bombing bassline and king-sized horns, but the presence of the brief, extraneous intro slightly clouds its impact.</em></p><p>
    Most of Disc One, subtitled ""The Soul"", is  solid, with relatively obscure picks from Fela and Dibango-- ""Ye Ye De Smell"" is an
    early Fela stomper typical of the awesome initial wave of Africa 70 recordings, Dibango's ""New Bell"" is sweet makossa funk. Peterson pulls Peter King's excellent ""Ajo"" from Harmless' out-of-print AfricaFunk compilation and drops in a few of great South African tracks culled from
    Strut's similarly unavailable <em>Club Africa discs, Miriam Makeba's ""Samba"" and Letta Mbulu's awesome Afro-soul track ""Mahlalela"", a stunning display of vocal virtuosity. South African jazz gets its day as well with ""Did You Hear that Sound"" by Abdullah Ibrahim (aka Dollar Brand), a dark ride on spare piano chords and splashy ride cymbal.</em></p><p>
    A couple of outstanding Ethio-jazz tracks occupy the middle of the disc-- and the style's inventor and master Mulatu Astatqe is 
    represented on both. ""Mulatu"" is taken from his 1972 U.S.-recorded LP <i>Mulatu of Ethiopia</i> and resembles a stripped-down version of his
    best-known song, ""Netsanet"", while ""Asmarina"" is curiously attributed to Feqadu Amde-Mesqel, though its original home was an LP called
    Yekatit\xD0Ethio-Jazz, credited to Mulatu Astatke featuring Fekadu Amde Maskal. Amde-Mesqel is the song's author and his stunning flute
    playing dominates the track, but I still question the credit.</p><p>
    Heading over to Disc Two (""The Spirit""), things are a little less even. OK, a lot less. I love what Masters at Work and Wunmi do on ""MAW
    Expensive (Tribute to Fela)"", mixing up the ""Expensive Shit"" groove and horn parts with Wunmi's impassioned reading of ""Upside Down"",
    Fela's brilliant protest of the imposition of European patrinomic systems on local African populations. The groove isn't as forceful in the
    hands of the Masters, but the looser, lighter edge plays better to a female vocalist than the Africa 70's militaristic onslaught. Otherwise,
    Congolese wrecking crew Konono No. 1's ""Lufuala Ndonga"" is still heavy as hell and hugely exciting, David Byrne &amp; Thievery Corporation get
    nicely funky on ""The Heart's a Lonely Hunter"" and the ""High Life mix"" of Dennis Ferrer's ""Funu"" works nicely enough, but that's as far as I
    get on the second half of the set. Honestly, Carl Craig's remix of Cesaria Evora's ""Angola"" can't hold a children's birthday candle to the
    original, and Osborne's ""Afrika"" has a nice vocal, but a totally wooden club beat that doesn't make me want to dance nearly as much as the
    simple bassline of ""Bukom Mashie"".</p><p>
    Overall, this a bunch of good tracks placed together in a manner that doesn't validate Peterson's reputation for impeccable
    sequencing, and a few tracks supposedly in the Afrobeat spirit that don't exactly measure up to the real thing. There's value here certainly,
    and if you're feeling like a little tourist jaunt into vintage Afropop, the first disc is a nice collection of good old songs, assembled in a
    decidedly touristic manner\xD0the fact that a few of these tracks (read: ""Mahlalela"" and ""Mulatu"") are pretty hard to find elsewhere helps, too.
    If you're really looking for a solid, focused introduction to African popular music, though, there are plenty of better options, including
    MCA's Fela reissues, anything on Soundway or Strut (Strut stuff is out of print but available if you look around hard enough) and Buda
    Musique's Ethiopiques series.</p></div>"|6252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6252-gilles-peterson-in-africa/|7.0|Joe Tangari

    Troubled Hubble are a nerdy blast from the too-recent-to-be-trendy
    past. Their style neatly summarizes the musical epoch before Travis
    Morrison lost his mojo-- back when Built to Spill were newly perfect,
    Isaac Mouse had nothing to think about, and ""soccer moms"" drove
    ""minivans"" instead of leather-upholstered tanks (eff you, H2!). Like a ""Happy Days"" for the geek-rock '90s, Troubled Hubble's
    2002 word-of-mouth breakthrough, <em>Penturbia</em>, was all that, but
    jollier, idealized.</p><p>
    
    Troubled Hubble's Lookout! debut, <em>Making Beds in a Burning
    House</em>, is actually their fourth full-length. In many ways, it's an
    evolution from its predecessors: cleaner recording quality, a few
    strings 'n' horns, and self-consciously literate lyrics (holy Hapsburg
    Empire, ""defenestrate""?). Indeed, singer/guitarist Chris Otepka hurls
    his words in a Mountain Goats-like torrent, reedy voice and all. ""That
    candle in the window is gonna be the reason your whole house burns,""
    Otepka warns before jumping breathlessly to another image and then
    another over Andrew Lanthrum's lithe, impossibly Dismembered bass line
    on superficially upbeat opener ""14000 Things to Be Happy About"". Then
    again, the rush of staccato verbiage on ""Ear Nose &amp; Throat"" brushes
    awkwardly close to R.E.M./Billy Joel list-song terrain (what else do I
    have to say?!).</p><p>
    
    A few standouts seem likely to bump up against the latest Clem Snide
    on your local college radio station. ""To Be Alive and Alone"" is a
    catchy, chiming affirmation of your between-classes quarter-life
    crisis (""It's nice to see you back in the game,"" Otepka begins, hoping
    to ""play""-- get it?). Going on a road trip? Throw meticulously
    straight-faced ""Floribraska"" onto your spring break mix disc. ""There's
    no place like the Midwest except the Southeast,"" quoth Otepka. The
    album's most memorable new song, ""Even Marathon Runners Need to Nap""
    is a gradually expanding mid-tempo indie-rocker worthy of a Grand
    Canyon wake and bake, or at least the library psychedelia of its
    forebears.</p><p>
    
    For all the strides Troubled Hubble have made (the dread
    ""maturation""!), in some ways <em>Making Beds in a Burning House</em> is
    unsatisfyingly retrograde, even beyond its derivativeness. For
    starters, nothing here rivals college radio fave ""I Love My Canoe"",
    which has appeared on two previous albums. And the song you'll leave
    humming? Bonus track ""Nancy"", essentially a guitar-based take on
    self-titled-era Ben Folds Five wimp-pop-- originally from
    <em>Penturbia</em>. Still, it's hard to complain while listening to the
    closing lines, which offer a glimpse into Troubled Hubble's charming
    worldview, or at least a decent AIM profile: ""What inspires you/ Should entire you/ Live how you want to be loved.""</p></div>"|8289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8289-making-beds-in-a-burning-house/|6.8|Marc Hogan

Superb, a call to arms for the factory unions to overthrow the petty, bourgeois pencilnecks who stare at their laptops during concert to emit neutered, pasteurized, and deracinated versions of glories past from the Warp Records Internationale of Aphex Twin, Autechre, Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, and Plaid. What is the manifesto, my comrade? Simple: Pretend that the last 15-odd years of industrial dance music didn't happen and concoct music accordingly-- that is dance like it is 1990.</p><p>
    True, the ""post-Warp"" zeitgeist could use a smack upside the head as it is still locked into the point where faster and more convoluted rhythms and harmonics are demanded. But I doubt that Kill Memory Crash's second release on a label that is sometimes guilty of being ""post-Warp"" will stamp an impact, as they play fairly generic, club-filler Electronic Body Music (EBM)-- the descendent of Skinny Puppy, Front 242, and Nitzer Ebb, translating industrial's mechanical rhythms and metal guitar grind into disco for sulking, malnourished vampires</p><p>
    Kill Memory Crash are vets from Chicago's industrial/EBM underground who've sporadically released a few singles since the mid-90s. <em>American Automatic  shows that their work could assist a Hollywood producer searching for the right background music for scenes when the hero cop marches into an ""underground club"" full of bikers, sneering dominatrixes, and hackers bent on world domination. The death disco strut of ""Demento"" marches along with fuzzed-out serial killer murmurings, clichd computer garbling, and bass drops. Kill Memory Crash also kick in obligatory nods to metal with synthesized guitar riffs, although on the auto-piloted ""Battery"" they lack the belt-sanding friction of Ministry and KMFDM.</em></p><p>
    To its credit, the group has a good ear for synth programming, as exemplified by ""Doorway Nine""'s flickering electro-funk melodies. Elsewhere, the duo adds murmuring deadpan vocals to a few tracks, disrupting those drones with DSP misfiring that snaps the listener awake. In all, it's like the band itself woke up from 15 years of sleep and picked up where industrial left off.</p></div>"|4599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4599-american-automatic/|4.9|Cameron Macdonald

He argued that Madlib and his pig-faced sidekick are so unique that critics shouldn't discourage their creativity.  Obviously, that's just not the way it works-- records can't be rewarded purely based on speculation or concept.  Otherwise, Macho Man's <i>Be a Man</i> would be the greatest album of all time.  Those types of comments aren't surprising coming from a Madlib fan, though.  The artist has a vice-like grip on a whole legion of followers, many of which are loyal enough to his creative muse that, for them, the joy of a genuinely rewarding listen is secondary to the joy of just hearing what he cooks up.</p><p>
    
    This is actually not awful logic: Madlib's work is generally worth seeking out, even when it's beneath his usual standards.  The problem here is that pieces of <em>Misadventures simply aren't finished.  Who wants to be the first to say it?  I mean, on one hand, if it's unfocused, it's probably because it's a fucking <i>stoner album</i>.  If it's slow, then it's reflective; if it's sparse, then it's minimalist.  But again, taking it at face value, on those terms, would be to gloss over missteps out of deference to the record's concept.  We aren't all stoners, and the sad truth is, ""Bus Ride"" really <i>is</i> just a couple of monotonous Melvin Van Peebles samples, and Madlib's snickerings, lugubrious bloops and weedtalk on ""Greenery"" really <i>aren't</i> all that fascinating.</em></p><p>
    
    I'm a huge Madlib fan, but there's a lot of nonsense here.  Were Madlib not the stoned-face iconoclast we all know and love, it would be easy to point to these kinds of seemingly mindless excursions as pomposity.  (That loop at the end of ""Shroom Music""?  The 30-second Nick at Nite samples?  Come on, dude.)  But Madlib isn't pretentious; he's just imperfect, and when you head into a project like this expecting-- even <i>hoping</i> for-- 27 stream-of-conscious studio experiments, it colors the whole thing differently.</p><p>
    
    In Madlib's defense, there is a ton of evidence of his genius at work here.  Shit, cut out a half-dozen two-minute sleepers and the rest of the material is actually rock solid: ""Rappcats, Pt. 3"" buzzes with breakbeat intensity as Quas rips through his all-time favorite MCs, and Doom returns with some <i>Madvillainy</i> shine on ""Closer"".  As an album, though, <i>The Further Adventures of Lord Quas</i> doesn't cut it.  I'll admit that somewhere in here lies a damn strong record, but it takes a lot of fast-forwarding to find it.</p></div>"|6612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6612-the-further-adventures-of-lord-quas/|7.0|Jamin Warren

Talk to them about how much your country sucks or how great they are. They're good at that. After listening to <em>Batards Sensibles, I really wanted to go the extra mile for all you future hate-mailers out there. The massive Euro-club beats and skanky charisma of Teki Latex, Tido Berman, and Cuizinier motivated me to do something special. I'm super lazy though, so that extra mile turned out to be the hundred yards to my neighbor's, a friendly young Parisian who'd agreed to some lyric translation in exchange for pretty much nothing. See, I took Latin in high school, and that shit is worthless. I could have used </em><em>pro bono two sentences ago, and it would have been the lone justification for three years of study. Just as well because, from what the neighbor told me, TTC's lyrical content is no loftier than a 50 Cent guest spot. Plenty of club-friendly nonsense about smacking people, bitches being hoes, etc, But every time she translated something, it was accompanied by a blushing giggle, the same kind of giggle that American women give in response to Ludacris or Cam'ron. It's the ""you nasty"" giggle, and it told me more about TTC's </em><em>modus operandi (yes!) than any translation ever would.</em></p><p>
    
    TTC are poseurs in the best of ways, mack thespians with a penchant for steady slobbin' on your earlobe. They are as willfully lecherous as Serge G. at his best, and their producers, Tacteel and Para One, match the MC's cartoon cadences with the oh-so-French art of sardonic electro-funk, with DJ Orgasmic the Toxicologist (I know) on the cut. Much like their successful compatriots, Daft Punk, TTC sound like they're having loads of laughs at our expense. Songs go from acid-squelched hyperbolic gangsterism (""Du Sang Sur Le Dancefloor"") to corny 1980s bounce that could easily have played during any number of Rusty's hijinks in <em>European Vacation (""Les Chants Des Hommes""). The title track's video better involve leather-clad werewolves or someone's not trying very hard. The production pulls as much from indigenous club music as it does from crunk or the more progressive of America's underground crews-- APC comes to mind-- yet, American influence is tangential. </em><em>Batards Sensibles is brethren to London's grime scene in its use of Stateside hip-hop as an inspiration, not a template. It draws from a more mainstream pool, which immediately makes it more accessible than a lot of grime, but the formula is the same. Its undeniable French-ness is its greatest asset, providing an alternative to its American counterpart where previous Franco hip-hop like MC Solaar and Supreme NTM were novel regurgitations.</em></p><p>
    
    The allure is not only in the production, though. Teki, Tido, and Cuizinier are as captivating and entertaining as any, despite the language barrier. Tido is nonchalant, laying up in the cut, running things. The boyish Cuizinier postures as lewd seducer, green gangster, and club ruler from song to song, the transparency of his schtick as endearing as those moments on hip-hop records when someone has his baby say ""fuck you, motherfucker."" And then there's Teki. Oh, sweet Teki. Sounding like an exiled Muppet, his voice is so surly and indignant that you just want to fill him full of beer and watch him ruin the party. Crews need distinct personalities, and there's no deficiency of character in any of these three. Possibly in an attempt to fulfill their label's English-language quotient, TTC brings in L.A. natives Busdriver and Radioinactive to spit approximately a billion words apiece on ""Latest Dance Craze"".</p><p>
    
    If you're still intent on deciphering the lyrics, don't eat for a few hours, go to TTC's website, and have Google translate it for you. The not eating is so you don't puke from laughing when you witness the brilliance. ""All the she-cats of the whores are moist,"" apparently. Of course they are, Teki Latex. Don't forget to ""give opera hats to their bottoms,"" playboy.</p></div>"|8178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8178-batards-sensibles/|8.0|Peter Macia

It's still up in the air why Fannypack ever got free-associated with NYC's willfully trashy hipster subcult in the first place, not when they were so clearly something else. Cartoon booty-bass, day-glo club squeakers, drop-rolling L'Trimm revivalism: Novelty hit or not, the stuff had enough meat to cross casually from Manhattan party kids to hip-hop radio play. Who doesn't get a kick out of teenage girls kicking beautifully bratty schoolyard rhymes? It's like Daphne and Celeste without the irony-- and with beats that once bounced like nothing else around.</p><p>
    
    It wasn't a formula anyone expected them to repeat, and they're wise not to try. It's 2005, you know, and the last member of the crew is legal now: With this second album, they're ready to take direction from Tyra Banks and get ""fierce."" The transition from happy teenage taunts to cursing and sex talk was probably inevitable, and quality-wise, it's a wash. It's with the sound-- as provided by producers Matt Goias and Fancy-- that you get your payoff.</p><p>
    
    No more bubbly electroid jump here; at its most distinctive, this record unleashes rhythm-happy stomps that kick and clap like black-college step routines. ""Keep it Up"", ""Feet and Hands"", and ""Pump It"" leaven their beats with crowd cheers, whistles, hand-claps, marching drums, even sneaker squeaks; for indie kids, this may be as good as the high school gym will ever sound. Something about that pep-squad energy brings out the old Fannypack, too. With these cuts, it's still all about drawers of broken cellphones and time-tested taunts like ""you're gonna pump my gas someday.""</p><p>
    
    The space around that gets more adult-serious, taking stabs at all the relevant radio staples: Say, sub-Missy r&amp;b; crooning for ""On My Lap"" (that one's about male strippers), or sub-Missy Diwali-styled riddim on ""Fire Fire"", which brings in Jamaican singer/toaster Mr. Vegas to cover the hook. Brooklyn ode ""Seven One Eight"" whips out dusty blues samples for an odd, clanky strut. And then, swinging in from the complete opposite direction, there's ""You Gotta Know""-- an unexpectedly <em>Off the Wall roller-disco jam that just might be the best thing this group's ever done.</em></p><p>
    
    The results don't have much on the pure cartoon charm of Fannypack's debut, and in spots they're left in a disappointing limbo-- wanting to compete on equal, adult terms with the tracks on the radio, but way too adorable and idiosyncratic to pull it off. We'll call them growing pains, though; getting too excited about the bratty day-glo remnants that shine through here may be the equivalent of wanting your daughter to stay prepubescent for all eternity. No, this stuff has got some thrills of its own, with male strippers right up among them. And if you happen to be the main character in an unexpected prequel to <em>Bring It On</em>, well: You can skip the drive down to Compton, and steal your step-step cheer routines right here.</p></div>"|3260.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3260-see-you-next-tuesday/|7.2|Nitsuh Abebe

But on <em>Luc's Lantern, William Parker's latest contribution to the series, the ever-prolific bassist/composer has crafted a song suite decidedly steeped in pure bop traditionalism, resulting in what is perhaps the least innovative album in his enormous discography. And though there's little here that would've sounded too outlandish on a typical Blue Note release ca. 1959, Parker is able to infuse these compositions with enough of his melodic, uniquely tender vitality to keep the album from ever resembling a rote museum piece.</em></p><p>
    
    Joining Parker for this session are drummer Michael Thompson and the classically-trained pianist Eri Yamamoto, a pair considerably less fire-breathing than such past Parker collaborators as Cecil Taylor, David S. Ware, or Hamid Drake. And though both players here sound perfectly capable of matching their leader's stride, there are several points through the likes of ""Adena"" or ""Evening Star Song"" where they defer to Parker's bass a bit too readily while he-perhaps not fully realizing his own strength-- casually outmuscles his bandmates to the front of the mix.</p><p>
    
    Even so, the trio here realize several peaks of vibrant melodicism and supple cohesion, never more so than on the pair of glowing mid-album tributes ""Jaki"" and ""Bud in Alphaville,"" which pay respectful homage to their jazz pianist forbears Jaki Byard and Bud Powell, both of whom performed with another of this set's obvious touchstones, Charles Mingus. On ""Jaki"" the three musicians settle into an amiable saunter that sounds as though it'd be ready to convert into a stripped-down version of Mingus' ""Fables of Faubus"" at the arch of an eyebrow, while on ""Bud in Alphavilla"", Yamamoto expertly echoes Powell's Bird-inspired single-note runs and nimble chords with Thompson adding flawless cymbal-crashing punctuation to the tune's every tight corner.</p><p>
    
    Throughout the album the musicians each keep their solos crisp and restrained, subordinating their playing to Parker's deft songcraft. This tasteful understatement yields great dividends on tracks like the wearily romantic ballad ""Charcoal Flower"" or the vivid ""Phoenix"", which features Yamamoto pounding out barrelhouse chords by the fistful, sounding just a shot or two removed from the honky-tonk.</p><p>
    
    Given Parker's almost super-human productivity-- he's appeared as leader or sideman on upwards of 40 albums since 2000-- his fans can afford to be fussy about which portions of his catalog they decide to sample. And with its adroit, seemingly effortless take on traditionalism, <em>Luc's Lantern should prove to be as accessible a point of entry as a newcomer could hope for, and as a refreshing, uncomplicated rear-view glance for Parker's established jazz audience.</em></p></div>"|6174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6174-lucs-lantern/|7.0|Matthew Murphy

    drums, zinging samples, Valkryie orchestral fanfares-- that married 
    orchestral disco, prog ambition, hip-hop crunch, and soundtrack pomp 
    with a 
    knowing wink. But, losing both his key collaborators and the wink as his 
    career 
    progressed, all that was left was the bombast-- Celine Dion with a 
    Fairlight

    to 
    the nut of his output than a perfectly curated selection would be. 
    Unfortunately, it's not always more listenable for telling the truth.</p><p>
    
    If Horn's main legacy had been as a member of the Buggles, he'd be a 
    footnote to the history of MTV. Instead, he hooked up with an ailing 
    pair of 
    schlockmeisters calling themselves Dollar, then a scrappy post-punk 
    soul 
    band called ABC, and promptly became the biggest producer in Britain. 
    He 
    climaxed mid-decade by co-creating the world's first apocalyptic queer 
    boy 
    band in Frankie Goes To Hollywood and helping to pants the industry in 
    Art 
    of Noise. Perhaps reeling from the backlash these projects engendered 
    in the 
    buying public, he finished out the decade with a succession of slick 
    MOR. He 
    was last seen smuggling T.a.t.u. into the west (yay) and producing

    Sebastian (eh).</p><p>

    ""Video 
    Killed the Radio Star"" and Frankie's ""Relax"" are part of the shared 
    cultural 
    hertiage of anyone born between 1968-1980. ABC's ""Poison Arrow"" is 
    stop-start dynamics on a Wagnerian scale-- Bond composer John Barry 
    meets 
    disco pioneer Georgio Moroder. His work with male glamazon Sealhenry 
    Samuel 
    was his last stab at anything like ""relevance,"" and ""Crazy"" remains a 
    fine 
    hi-gloss distillation of Soul II Soul's mixture of eerie and euphoric. 
    But 
    Simple Minds and Spandau Ballet are bad bands in a way that no amount 
    of 
    historical revisionism is going to tame, and LeeAnn Rimes' ""Can't Fight 
    The 
    Moonlight"" is no sane person's idea of a comeback. Neither is 
    T.a.t.u.'s 
    ""All the Things She Said"", though it does at least tip its hat to the 
    homo-hysteria of FGTH.</p><p>
    
    The second disc makes a pretty good case for Horn as, warts and all, 
    the 
    best producer of the 80s. (Marley Marl may trump him. Prince is 
    Prince.) 
    Horn's lost-weekend as a member of Yes (as bizarre-yet-right as 
    Pharrell 
    joining Pearl Jam) produced one undeniable classic in ""Owner of a 
    Lonely 
    Heart"". The Art of Noise's ""Beat Box"" predicts the boom-bap of late-80s 
    rap, 
    looping a chest-thumping drum break from those Yes sessions and 
    rendering 
    everything else (orchestral blare, pixilated samples) as stabs. It 
    marked 
    probably the last time a group of aging white Britons would score a U.S. 
    hip-hop hit. Frankie's ""Two Tribes"" stages nuclear annihilation as camp 
    dancefloor pantomime, mutually assured destruction as the ultimate 
    illicit 
    orgasm. AON's ""Moments in Love"" lampoons new age loveliness even as it 
    trumps it, its soft-focus synths and flushed inhalations the ultimate 
    yuppie 
    makeout music that transcends itself. Malcom McLaren's sly, spry 
    cut-and-scratch ""Buffalo Gals"" turned the Sex Pistol's slimeball into 
    the 
    most unexpected rap star ever (except maybe Mel Brooks). ABC's ""The 
    Look of 
    Love"" was modern classicism at its most overwrought (live strings and 
    horns, 
    booming tympani, Martin Fry's strained vocal) and their ""All of My 
    Heart"" 
    may be the most beautiful thing Horn (and the band) ever made. (I still 
    can't figure out what's making those starchild/space whale gurgles on 
    the 
    outro.)</p><p>
    
    There has been much debate as to how much Horn contributed to his 
    various 
    projects. (After the band's falling out, The Art of Noise's J.J. 
    Jeczalik 
    calculated Horn's involvement at slightly less than 2%.) Judging by his 
    later, less radical (both sonically and conceptually) work, Horn was a 
    gifted but often uninspired studio boffin when the catalytic agent of 
    people 
    like AON/Frankie co-creator Paul Morley, ABC's Martin Fry, and McLaren 
    was 
    out of the picture. But no matter what his actual involvement (and 
    personally I'd put it at a lot higher than 2%), Horn was the glue. The 
    music 
    endures, 20 years later, even if <i>Produced By Trevor Horn isn't 
    always its best showcase. If you don't already own the original 
    records, all 
    can be found cheap and all (especially ABC's </i>Lexicon of Love) are 
    essential documents of their era.</p></div>"|2068.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2068-produced-by-trevor-horn/|6.7|Jess Harvell

What's more, B&amp;S; were perhaps the last UK indie act that listeners engaged with through the late 70s/80s model of John Peel plays, weekly mag coverage, BBC sessions, 7""'s. It made sense: Many early converts were lapsed indie listeners or former P!O!P! kids who gave up on insularity and constructing worlds around their musical obsessions; people who couldn't imagine wearing badges like medals, passing their fandom around like a secret handshake, having a devotion to an artist serve as a conversation icebreaker.</p>
<p>The band did itself no shortage of favors constructing its own myth, quickly refusing to speak to the music press and hatching phony liner-note tales. On record, they also created their own sense of mystique via the self-referential metapop of ""Belle &amp; Sebastian"", a hidden, unnamed track at the end <i>3...6...9</i> that addressed their press-shy behaviour, and the in-jokes and self-deprecation that plays over the churning, Velvets-y second act of ""This Is Just a Modern Rock Song"".</p>
<p>Among Belle &amp; Sebastian's many throwback habits were valuing the single and the EP as a separate entity from the album. <i>Push Barman to Open Old Wounds collects this non-LP output, originally spread over seven EPs released between 1997 and 2001. This set compiles all of B&amp;S;' Jeepster-era singles tracks save an extended version of the instrumental ""Judy Is a Dick Slap"", which appeared on the ""Legal Man"" 12"". The first half is the three four-track EPs clumsily packaged as the <i>Lazy Line Painter Jane</i> set-- that box's title EP plus <i>Dog on Wheels</i> and <i>3...6...9 Seconds of Light</i></i>, all released in 1997. The second half features their four EPs released from 1998-2001: <i>This Is Just a Modern Rock Song</i>, <i>Legal Man</i>, <i>Jonathan David</i>, and <i>I'm Waking Up to Us</i>.</p>
<p>The 1997 EPs kicked off with <i>Dog on Wheels</i>, which featured three 1996 demos plus ""String Bean Jean"". In all, the tracks romanticized childhood, wrung happy memories out of post-university poverty, and lamented the fleeting nature of happiness. <i>3...6...9</i> and <i>Lazy Line Painter Jane</i> increasingly took advantage of the collective swelling in ranks, adding lush strings and increasingly highlghting Mick Cooke's trumpet playing. On the whole, the three carried echoes of the whitewashed soul and puritanism of Orange Juice and Scot indiekid fave Vic Godard is evident in the band's quaint, fey, self-deprecating lyrics.</p>
<p>Collected as a whole, these dozen tracks are probably the quintessential Belle and Sebastian album, and ""The State That I'm In"" (included here is a demo version) and ""A Century of Fakers"" are still arguably their best songs. On the surface the EPs created an idealized world of childhood memories, books, crushes, bicycle rides, and faded photos. But no mere shrinking violet, Stuart Murdoch traded in ""la-la-la""'s and also spent time threatening that ""if you ever go lardy or go lame, I will drop you straightaway"", and wondering how to ""tell [one's] folks about a dose of thrush.""</p>
<p>Kicking off the second disc are the <i>This Is Just a Modern Rock Song</i> and <i>Legal Man</i> EPs, which, at the time, seemed like the band's first real distress signals. As on 1998's <i>The Boy With the Arab Strap</i>, Murdoch ceded some of the songwriting duties to his bandmates (to Isobel Campbell on this set's nadir, ""The Gate"", to the recently departed Stuart David with the inclusion of ""Winter Wooskie"", and to the band itself with raveups ""Legal Man"" and ""Judy Is a Dick Slap"") and includes his own B&amp;S; MK. 1 low, ""I Know Where the Summer Goes"". Murdoch's one moment of true inspiration, Wildean heartbreaker ""Slow Graffiti"", was commissioned for the film version of Irvine Welsh's <i>The Acid House</i>, suggesting that perhaps his internal muse was fleeting.</p>
<p>With hindsight, Murdoch possibly did need a break but tracks that seemed anomalous or out-of-place at the time are far more compelling now. ""TIJAMRS"" and ""Legal Man"" still may be more cute than clever but both exude buckets of charm and display the band's emerging sense of ambition and willingness to create rather than playact. ""Wooskie"" and ""Judy"" are each a bit more by-the-numbers, but no less engaging for it and deserve to be more than the career footnotes they currently seem to be.</p>
<p>More revealing are the two EPs that followed the disappointing <i>Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant album and which close out this set. The move away from Murdoch's personal voice to a process of true collaboration and democritization not only initiated a sharing of songwriting duties but richer sonics and an emphasis on common touchstones, which resulted in the band favoring lush throwbacks to Northern Soul and 1960s baroque pop and sonically or lyrically referencing artists such as Love, the Beach Boys, and Motown where they once namechecked tracks and albums from more private obsessions such as Felt, Josef K, and the Pastels.</i></p>
<p>The Biblical metaphor and Stevie Jackson vocals on ""Jonathan David"" aren't the post-<i>FYH</i> gut-punch they once were-- and the song's bridge, piano fill, and harmonies are glorious. The final A-side included here, ""I'm Waking Up to Us"", is even better. Murdoch's stilted Arthur Lee impersonation seems appropriate for the on-the-heels lyric, a constipated delivery for a track with a protagonist trying and failing to mask his pain and maintain dignity and pride while his romantic  world crumbles. The baroque sophistipop arrangement is exquisite craft without sacrificing emotion for polish; listening it to it now makes it clear how unsurprising it should have been that the band would later hook up with producer Trevor Horn.</p>
<p>Of their B-sides, the most notable is the belated release of a version of ""The Loneliness of the Middle-Distance Runner"", a longtime live favorite once tipped to follow the <i>TIJAMRS</i> EP as an A-side. The studio version is inferior to earlier arrangements but it's still retains a graceful, slippery beauty. The others are uniformly excellent, highlighted by the narrator of ""Take Your Carriage Clock and Shove It"" says ""boo to the business world"" but only after outlasting the more soul-crushing demands of adulthood and the return to introverted bookishness of ""Marx and Engels"".</p>
<p>The most beloved indie pop band since the Smiths, Belle and Sebastian are also probably the best. This collection would work like their own <i>Hatful of Hollow</i> and <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> were the first half not sadly missing their early BBC Sessions, and the second forced to omit their <i>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</i> singles and Peel Session tracks. As it stands, the first is a testament to the power and pull of one the most singular and instantly lovable pop bands of our time; the second is a gentle suggestion that they took the correct post-mainstream fame steps after all, avoiding self-parody (see: Morrissey) and finding a way to be playful without becoming too precious (see: Lawrence in his post-Felt years). In combination, it's a perfect way into the world of Belle and Sebastian, even if the band spends the second half of the disc trying to redecorate that space.</p></div>"|637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/637-push-barman-to-open-old-wounds/|9.2|Scott Plagenhoef

    printed in paragraph form in the insert booklet, the book-like look of 
    the CD sleeve-- <i>The Forgotten Arm</i> is no more conceptual albumthan any 
    other Aimee Mann album. Regardless of what is sung or who she sings 
    with, the underlying message is often the same-- life is tough, love 
    can 
    make life easier and even tougher all at once, and the crap folks put 
    up 
    with for love is both admirable and ridiculous. For this album, Mann 
    chose to talk about this theme through the trials and tribulations of 
    two characters, delineating their dissolution and resolution linearly, 
    over the course of 12 songs.</p><p>
    
    The story in <i>The Forgotten Arm</i> is girl 
    (Caroline) meets boxer (John) at a county fair, boxer and girl go gaga 
    for each other, boxer and girl go on the road, boxer is addicted to 
    drugs, girl cuts boxer loose, boxer wises up to his problem and quits 
    the stuff, boxer and girl ride off into the sunset. The title of the 
    album refers to a boxing maneuver wherein a fighter in close quarters 
    uses one arm to punch and lets the other arm hide in plain sight, 
    waiting to land a surprise blow. No doubt this idea of a sucker punch 
    fits perfectly with the ups and downs of Caroline and John's 
    cross-country tryst-- falling in love, learning about your lover's drug 
    addiction, the addict finding out he's being dumped. It's also a 
    maneuver Mann uses adeptly within songs, dropping in a deceptively 
    powerful detail that snaps a scene into sharp focus, like this couplet 
    from ""The King in the Jailhouse"": ""...they pack up their troubles in 
    an 
    old Cadillac-- that's her in the mirror, asleep in the back.""</p><p>
    
    Musically, <i>The Forgotten Arm</i> is a down-to-earth version of what folks 
    expect from an Aimee Mann record. Joe Henry's production doesn't offer 
    the multi-instrumental whimsy of Mann's best-known work with Jon Brion, 
    though there are moments (such as when the mandolin comes into play on 
    ""Video"") that briefly recall those songs. Otherwise, it's a 
    straight-up 
    rock record essayed live-to-tape by a handful of studio pros. 
    Sometimes, the ""studio pro"" vibe is a bit too redolent-- see those 
    ""forgotten arm"" wee-er wee-er wanky guitar moments-- but these folks 
    otherwise do a fine job in letting Mann's songs shine.</p><p>
    
    And this is an Aimee Mann record through and through. Even though 
    she's 
    writing songs under the guise of two different characters, it's her 
    lyrical voice that's actually speaking. If you're able to suspend 
    disbelief enough so that a junkie boxer can talk about being trapped in 
    a ""cone of silence"" or observe that ""all the sweet green trees of 
    Atlanta burst like little bombs, or little pom-poms,"" then you might be 
    up for a high-ranking position in the U.S. government. Regardless of the 
    happy ending of John and Caroline's story, there's no treacly moments 
    to be had. The resolution is a hard-fought one, with plenty of knocks 
    collected along the way for both characters. Mann's despondent deadpan 
    eloquence, as it's been for her entire career, is perfect for 
    delineating each of these bumps and bruises in loving detail. After 
    all, this is a songwriter that had some of the best actors in Hollywood 
    singing, ""It's not going to stop until you wise up."" Don't go thinking 
    she's going to take it easy now that she's directing and scripting her 
    own characters. So, yeah, here's yet another exemplary Aimee Mann 
    album 
    to add to the pile. Ho-hum.</p></div>"|5084.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5084-the-forgotten-arm/|7.4|David Raposa

By stamping the inescapable catchphrase ""Who Is Mike Jones?"" and his phone number all over his albums and chopped-up mixtapes, he built a cottage industry out of his own accessibility. By the time Kelefa Sanneh printed Jones' phone number (281-330-8004) in <i> The New York Times</i>, the emcee's grassroots promo plan had already sold loads of records. (It also helped that Texas is the size of a small, self-sustainable country; every major player in the Houston scene was checking cheddar like a food inspector before the major labels started calling from the coasts.) And because Jones released his major-label debut before any of his cohorts (Slim Thug, Chamillionaire, Paul Wall), he gets to be starting line-up for the Houston takeover. Mike Jones has, to borrow my high school boyfriend's senior quote, made his name everyone's world.</p><p>
    Jones advertises his phone number on roughly every single track of WIMJ?, often rhyming the last digit, ""fo',"" with ""Hit Mike Jones up on the low/ 'Cause Mike Jones about to blow."" After the fifth or so time you start wondering if he has anything else to talk about; nevertheless, it's charming when he shouts at us all big and charismatic like a 10-gallon car salesman-- Houston <i>is</i> the capital of Texas car sales and the lynchpin of America's cutthroat oil industry, after all-- and when Jones isn't bragging on his majorness or woman-hating on ""Scandalous Hoes"", his raps are about driving as pimp factor: cars flossing wood-grain dashboards, fresh coats of candy paint, and hot rims. He shouts his milk-throated Houston drawl mostly slow: because if you drive fast you might bump the underside of your 'Lac on the blacktop. I mean, have you ever driven in Houston? The highways are plugged up with leviathan wide-body pick-up trucks that could bulldoze an SUV like a <em>cucaracha. (I'm sorry to inform Mike Jones that trucks accounted for 57% of all new vehicle sales in Houston in 2004.) There's something inherently rebellious about going 15 mph down a Houston street, all low to the ground like you're about to pounce-- a kind of ""eff-you"" to the Ford F250 gas-guzzler George W. Bush helms.</em></p><p>
    Or maybe that ""eff-you"" should be ""finger-flippin' and syrup-sippin',"" as Jones raps in ""Still Tippin'"", the quietly blazin', violin-samplin' hit featuring Slim Thug and Paul Wall. Jones' verse on ""Still Tippin'"" is emblematic of Houston with its DJ Screw legacy and take-no-prisoners corporate creed, and the video is the best art film I've seen all year-- the sky is all purple, there are people rollin' everywhere!-- but the track sticks most to Slim Thugga's syrupy man-drawl, which sounds chopped and screwed without the assistance of a DJ. Jones doesn't mesmerize like S. Thugga, though his stumbled braying sounds oddly terrific over the oom-pah rhythms and screwed chorus on ""Know What I'm Sayin'""; the ""Nutcracker Suite""-alluding ""Got it Sewed Up"" (Rapid Ric's <i>Fistful of Dollars</i> mixtape has the actual ""Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy"" sample); and the dubby yodelayheehoodling on ""Cuttin'"".</p><p>
    On ""Cuttin'"", incidentally, Jones is less interested in talking about nasty humping (aka cuttin') than serving his standard supper: drank, skunk, driving and, of course, blowing up. So when his ice grill softens a little on ""5 Years from Now"" and ""Grandma"", a sweet devotional to the lady who coined his catchphrase atop a beautiful guitar melody-- in an ironic twist, its sample is sped-up-- it's a nice break from Jones' relentless self-promo. <i>Who Is Mike Jones?</i> is an ample showcase for Swishahouse producers Michael K. Watts and Silah Williams, but it'd be a better record if Jones diversified. However, if anyone was going to prep America for the slew of forthcoming H-Town major-label releases, it's Mike Jones-- Who? Mike Jones. CALL NOW: Operators are standing by.</p></div>"|4359.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4359-who-is-mike-jones/|7.0|Julianne Shepherd

After the back-to-back releases of Wilco's lackluster <i>A.M.</i> and Son Volt's lived-in <em>Trace, Farrar seemed destined for greatness, and Tweedy destined for obscurity. A few years later, I saw how wrong I was: It wasn't simply that <i>Being There</i> was that great a follow-up, but that </em><em>Straightaways was such a fatally dull second album. Full of bland retreads of </em><em>Trace songs, it started off ho-hum and went downhill from there, backloaded with so many downtempo, amelodic tracks that even Farrar couldn't seem to muster a committed performance.</em></p><p>
    
    As Wilco became one of the most critically celebrated bands in America, Son Volt tried to broaden its sound on <em>Wide Swing Tremolo, but they were so stuck in a rut they could only disband, and Farrar released a couple of solo records that re-established a core audience without attracting much attention. Now, amid a softening nostalgia for the mini-movement Uncle Tupelo helped define and plans for a new Son Volt album this summer, Rhino is issuing </em><em>A Retrospective: 1995-2000. Making absolutely no promise of definitiveness, the title says it all: It's 20 tracks culled from the band's three albums, along with a handful of covers and live takes.</em></p><p>
    
    Right off the bat, something seems askew: <em>A Retrospective begins with ""Drown"" instead of ""Windfall"", which is both the lead-off track on </em><em>Trace and the quintessential alt-country song, a perfect summation of the genre's aesthetic as it fuses travel, a.m. radio, steel guitar, and a driving desire to connect to something larger and older than yourself. That it has been relegated to second-track position seems an oversight, as are the omissions of </em><em>Trace's Ron Wood cover ""Mystifies Me"", </em><em>Straightaways's opener ""Caryatid Easy"", and </em><em>Wide Swing Tremolo's ""Dead Man's Clothes"".</em></p><p>
    
    ""Drown"" (or, as I called it in college, ""You're Cousin It"") is perhaps the band's most recognizable track, but in the context of <em>A Retrospective, it sounds nearly indistinguishable from songs like ""Picking Up the Signal"", ""Creosote"", and ""Driving the View"", all of which utilize the same formula: tight mid-tempo rhythm section with no drum fills; wide-open guitar sound; a big, low voice delivering lyrics that don't always bother to make sense. The number of such tracks on </em><em>A Retrospective makes it surprisingly monotonous, especially for a best-of comp that has so much material from which to cull.</em></p><p>
    
    Aside from the live acoustic versions of a few songs, the added extras on <em>A Retrospective are six covers that exhibit a greater diversity than the album tracks. Son Volt's late-90s take on the Del Reeves trucker anthem ""Looking Through a Windshield"" has aged about as well as early-00s trucker caps, and Farrar can't muster the excitability on Springsteen's ""Open All Night"" to sell lines like ""I'm goin' out tonight/ I'm gonna rock that joint."" But his hangdog vocals contrast dramatically with Kelly Willis's sharp croon on Townes Van Zandt's ""Rex's Blues"", and Farrar sounds like a drunk staggering down the hall-- in the best way possible-- on Alex Chilton's ""Holocaust"".</em></p><p>
    
    I don't begrudge Son Volt their modesty of sound and scope, nor do I hold it against them that they weren't Uncle Tupelo or Wilco. There is something refreshing, if only briefly so, about the band's unalterably limited range, especially when compared with Tweedy's self-consciously aggressive innovation. If nothing else, <em>A Retrospective at least marks the moment when these three bands have diverged so dramatically from each other that any comparison between them becomes more nostalgic than musical.</em></p></div>"|7330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7330-a-retrospective-1995-2000/|6.7|Stephen M.

Nor should anyone be shocked that, despite the new song structures, guitar solos, and drum fills, Brownstein's guitar still roars wildly, Weiss's drums still thunder, and Tucker still wails with a primal urgency that is one of the most compelling sounds in rock music today.  What hasn't necessarily been made explicitly clear is that, even in the face of its cock-rock trappings, <em>The Woods</em> most closely recalls the righteous fury of their first great albums, <em>Call the Doctor</em> (1995) and <em>Dig Me Out</em> (1996).</p><p>  The brash economy of punk, for Sleater-Kinney at least, has always been just a short step away from the lumbering behemoth of hard rock.  ""The Fox"", however, seems to say otherwise.  Opening the album, this piece of Aesop rock is about a fox and a duck, and I think it just might be allegorical.  But it's loud and it thrashes and Tucker shouts to be heard over the din.  It's ferociously uninviting, but it works both as a context-providing preface to the nine songs that follow and as a deterrent for weak-eared listeners.  Those who make it to ""Wilderness"" will have passed a test of sorts.</p><p>  ""Wilderness"" and most of ""What's Mine Is Yours"" sound like prime Sleater-Kinney, as does much of the rest of <em>The Woods</em>. Fridmann's presence is far from disruptive; you can hardly hear him in the mix, except for a little sludge in the low end-- a nice substitution for a bass player. Instead of weighing them down with single-mic'd Flaming Lips drums or Delgados density, he simply steps out of the way and allows them to sound larger, louder, and looser.</p><p>  Turning their crosshairs away from the overt political issues of <em>One Beat</em>, Sleater-Kinney's amplification here sounds like a reaction to the current wave of backwards-looking boys-club bands that idolize post-punk dramatists like Joy Division and the Cure and abstractors like Gang of Four and Wire.  (And anyway, weren't the women of Elastica working this same nostalgia, like, 10 years ago?)  On ""Entertain""-- the first single, no less-- Brownstein chides the eyeliner brigade righteously: ""You come around looking 1984/ You're such a bore, 1984/ Nostalgia, you're using it like a whore/ It's better than before.""</p><p>  But Sleater-Kinney are looking backwards too, albeit to a different time in rock history and to different styles, as well as with a greater open-mindedness and self-awareness. Many of the hard-rock trappings of <em>The Woods</em> sound self-conscious: Leading into the album-closing ""Night Light"", the 11-minute guitar solo on ""Let's Call It Love"" is just that-- an 11-Minute Guitar Solo. The badass breakdown on ""What's Mine Is Yours"" is just that-- a Badass Breakdown. But the point of ""Let's Call It Love"" is the equation of music and sex as Brownstein sings, ""I've got a long time for love"" and then proves it with her guitar. And the point of ""What's Mine Is Yours"" is, as the lyrics reveal, not the breakdown but the recovery: As Brownstein's guitar squawks boisterously and arrhythmically, Tucker stitches it together with a low Led Zep riff and Weiss wraps it up with a big drum beat, all three of them literally creating music from chaos.</p><p>  In other words, this hard-rock transformation sounds like an extension of all the meta songs they've been writing since before ""I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone""-- rock-about-rock songs that chronicle their experience as an all-woman band and that deploy that self-reflexivity as a weapon against industry double standards and general ignorance.  In the past, this self-awareness often resulted in songs that sounded closed-off, each with its own extremely precise meaning that related but didn't always connect to other songs around it. <em>The Woods</em>, on the other hand, is their most album-like album since <em>The Hot Rock</em>, each song building on the previous and leading to the next. With its artificially sweetened melody, ""Modern Girl"", for instance, almost sounds saccharine (""My whole life is like a picture of a sunny day""), but coming after ""Jumpers"", a song so empathetic it considers suicide a viable act of defiance, ""Modern Girl"" takes on deeper meanings.  The pair are two sides of the same woman, the ultimate predicament: To survive these days, you have to be either suicidal or superficial.  Sleater-Kinney, meanwhile, get by simply sounding fucking supersonic.</p><p> </p></div>"|7240.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7240-the-woods/|9.0|Stephen M. Deusner

Boy forms band. Boy's band drop a couple of startlingly great records. Boy doesn't seem to notice, and goes on waxing introspective as band's career seems more and more like a prematurely begun ride into the sunset. Boy dissolves band and stakes out on solo career, releasing a couple of startlingly MOR records, the merits of which are kinda halfheartedly debated-- by now, people have divested themselves emotionally of Boy. Somewhere along the line, Boy realizes he is no longer a boy. (Here's where it gets fuzzy.) <em>Man</em> discovers synthesizers and becomes, once again, gloriously, a boy. Excuse me: Boy.</p><p>  Pardon the oversimplification, but that really seems to be what it took for Stephen Malkmus to recover his youthful mien. <em>Face the Truth</em> is SM's third solo album and his first to hold the line against the work of Pavement and Silver Jews. The album fuses seamlessly three distinct strains of his songwriting, which have jostled clumsily and often collided head-on throughout his career: The lanky, hammed-up guitar rock and the warm-hued air of ""sunset nostalgia"" it abets are nothing new; but Malkmus' playful experimentation with electronic instrumentation is a more recent phenomenon. Behind this happy clash of stylistic preferences is a subtly but surely revivified Malkmus, confident to experiment more deliberately than ever.</p><p>  Experimentation, wha? If you're a <em>Slanted &amp; Enchanted</em> devotee, you might read any stab at reinvention as a death knell-- even though you were probably bored to tears Malkmus' previous solo efforts, you crank. But Malkmus is underdog personified, and unlikely triumph was one of Pavement's key draws. Another was their ability to forge illusory stylistic coherence despite their records' actual heterogeneousness. Appropriately enough, <em>Face the Truth</em> is dizzyingly eclectic, tracing a haphazard arc and often working exactly when, where, and how it shouldn't. Opener ""Pencil Rot"" supernovas with a boxy, towering synthesizer that would sound at home in a Lil' Jon beat. In marked contrast are the track's whip-crack beat and rollicking, John Squire-referencing guitars. But rather than blend, Malkmus stacks, and the result is comfy sonic largess. <em>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</em>'s ""Range Life"", which quotes the same Squire lick, sounds reedy by comparison.</p><p>  From ""Pencil Rot"" the album leaps light years to album teaser ""It Kills"", which condenses Malkmus's jammy kick (see: <em>Pig Lib</em>'s nine-minute ""1% of One"") into something infinitely more manageable-- a lightly swung pop song streaming with sinewy lines. The pilot ad for <em>Face the Truth</em> features an anachronistic female model, all seafoam green jumpsuit and sprayed-stiff coif, prostrate before the camera in a sexually self-servicing pose. As ""It Kills"" makes clear, the masturbatory insinuations aren't unintentional: Synths et al. aside, <em>Face the Truth</em> is, at its core, a great guitar record.</p><p>  If ""It Kills"" is the fried egg squatting atop a bed of noodles, let ""No More Shoes"" stand for the whole Pho shop. Now, this sunset nostalgia business, I can see it getting pretty soporific if it weren't so well executed-- especially when stretched across an eight-minute, Kiss-quoting, free-soloing odyssey. Unlike ""1% of One"", however, here Malkmus drops a quick pilot verse and he's off. Fuck that check back in periodically crap, melody. You ain't my mom. ""No More Shoes"" rips for a full five minutes before returning to Earth, and when it does, it's changed. Espresso buzzing. Post-coital glowing. Ate-too-much tummy aching. A tousled Malkmus yowls like a scatological beat atop the entrails, before conceding one final verse. It's virtuosic, sure, but hardly wanky: Malkmus's guitar playing has matured from artful sloven to artful sloven capable of moments of electrifying spontaneity and elegantly verbose phrasing, much the way latter-day Sonic Youth have blossomed into punk Mozarts.</p><p>  How better to follow <em>Face the Truth</em>'s most musically longwinded number with its most lyrically concise? Malkmus's word play is generally more unabashed here than on Pig Lib, as witnessed by aforementioned ""Pencil Rot,"" which blithers in stream-of-(altered)-consciousness: ""I'm here to sing a song, a song about privilege/ The spikes you put on your feet when you were crawlin' and dancin' to the top of the human shit pile/ Shit pile."" But ""Mama"" forgoes the invisible ink, painting a bucolic family portrait at a canted angle: ""Mama's in the kitchen with onions/ Daddy's in the back with Old Hank/ Talkin' 'bout the lasers and bunions, talkin' disability rank/ No, we didn't have too much money."" I've omitted the last line in the sequence because, delivered in a brittle falsetto and matched to the Jicks' taut upbeat kicks, it's shatteringly beautiful, and I'd rather not spoil the moment by trying to decipher what's being said. Other highlights include the balls-out sloppy joe anthem ""Baby, C'mon"" and the soft-twinkling ""Freeze the Saints"", which is bathetic in the most charming way.</p><p> <em>Face the Truth</em> might serve as a first encounter for a young generation of Pavement-uninitiated. If that's the case, congrats. I'm genuinely excited for you. It gets even better from here. But I get the sense, also, that a growing contingent of Pavement's alpha fans find Malkmus' new millennium solo conquests excessive, watered down, sappy, <em>old</em>, etc. Well, fuck, aren't we a party pooper? The reason Malkmus remains so vital is because he's aged gracefully; his music shows none of the sagging flesh of existential panic. In fact, there's still a breeziness to it that, while not as spry and unvarnished as Pavement, bespeaks a man who has no illusions about his age: Thirty-eight is young, and if ""Oil Can"" Boyd can still throw a fastball, why can't one of his generation's greatest songwriters and his Jicks master a few new tricks?</p><p> </p></div>"|5059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5059-face-the-truth/|8.7|Sam Ubl

Banhart has a  beard-- hey, so does my dentist. So do most Catholic priests and nuns. Newsom  has a crazy voice and wears colorful clothes. Whatever. All my buddies shop  at Ecko, too. So does my dentist. So does my rabbi. All you kids with your fucked-up teeth and Martin backpackers, get your weight up-- you are not freakfolk-as-fuck. You are not freakfolk in the flesh.</p><p>  Call it a guest spit-- though I'm done with all that, seriously, so  let's just call it a spot-- Foster's solo spit on <em>Golden Apples of the  Sun</em> made for one of that comp's most memorable outings. We wanted more solo Foster, but settled for the excellent Born Heller collabo with Jason  Ajemian and the slightly less excellent rock-opera <em>All The Leaves Are  Gone</em> LP Foster cut with her band the Supposed. Then this solo record dropped  (!) last month and we finally find out how truly nuts this woman is.  <em>Hazel Eyes, I Will Lead You</em> is not a collection of whipper-snapped  nature-isms with the occasional diminished chord hacking shit up. No, this record actually taps into some palpable loneliness-- a hopeless, almost Orphic worldview where song's both the symptom and the cure.</p><p>  Lots of times I feel like Foster's career is an alternate ending to  <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>-- instead of melting-melting we get exile music,  ""Throw away my food/ And find a dish of stone/ Perhaps I would be fuller/ If I started at the bone"", and the wicked west's most sweetly terrifying  croon, confident in its glissandos and rubatos, bolstered by tasteful overdubs  and found percussion. Writing a flip on the Sirens called ""The Siren's Admonition"", Foster seems hyper-aware of her vocal affectations; to her immense credit, she doesn't merely execute but flips further. The  Sirens would never admonish-- would never advise, ""Careful of your secret  love!""-- since they're sustained precisely on knee-jerk human impulse. This  isn't lit-jocking though; the tension's in the voice, in the music, more  visceral than learned. And that's a further conceit, since here we are, hanging  on her every word not to hang on her every word.</p><p>  So Foster's got this vaguely martyr-like songbird persona she's  working, and sometimes the devious witch bit sticks out too, as on ""Crackerjack  Fool"". The old ""Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird"" nursery rhyme's here set  to black sway and flame, viciously puritan and blistery: ""Shush little  baby, you be cool!/ Or you're gonna grow into a crackerjack fool!/ Caw caw  caw caw..."" Foster's a spine-tingler who baits with images of the familiar inevitable, her voice a nightmare we want to have. She won't tell us  things are gonna be better, and she won't give us counsel to make things so ourselves-- ""There are reasons for our trials/ They are not our own"".  But whatever back-alley grove she's working, she's playing these songs all  the time, and off-track visitors don't bother her.</p></div>"|8973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8973-hazel-eyes-i-will-lead-you/|7.8|Nick Sylvester

It helps that they tap the
    soul-stirring tropes of popdork hagiography: resolute indifference to
    trends, early 7-inches scarcer than the '89 Bill Ripken swear card you
    foolishly put in plastic, and an anti-image image that had humble rock
    typists at ""hirsute"" (um guilty). The late 2004 release of first
    single ""Hymn for Her"" introduced freedom-hating mp3-downloaders and a
    few eBay high-rollers to the British quartet's distinctive sound,
    updated 1960s folk-pop steeped in xylophone and catharsis. The
    cognoscenti smiled; the UK press readied its superlatives. But who
    needs 'em?</p><p>
    
    On their self-titled, full-length debut, the Magic Numbers are easy
    for your mother, grandmother, older brother, kid sister and their
    <em>American Idol</em>-obsessed friends to love, too. (Is it cool to
    like <em>American Idol</em> this week? The Magic Numbers don't care.)
    Let's get this out of the way right now: I'm gonna have to drop the
    triple-A bomb. AAA stands for the ""Adult Album Alternative"" radio
    format, which stands for Dave Matthews Band, Train, and Matchbox 20, so
    Pitchfork pretty much won't stand for it. The Magic Numbers could have
    waxed nostalgic for the folk-pop equivalent of the nouveau new-wave
    and gotten the easy 6.7. Instead, they've created what will doubtless
    stand as 2005's best AAA record. And, contrary to that genre's
    built-in assumptions, it doesn't even suck. Musical bait 'n' switch
    hasn't been this exhilarating since Blur tapped dulcet Anglo-gospel
    stomp ""Tender"" as the lead single for cacophonous 1999 album
    <em>13</em>.</p><p>
    
    Newest single ""Forever Lost"" reveals the Numbers' world-dominating
    intentions right away. Its initial clear, ringing guitar chords owe
    both their tone and voicing to the alternating E and E major seventh
    of another AAA hit: ""No Such Thing"", which vaulted misunderestimated
    indie anathema John Mayer into the top 40 some three years ago. As the hook, lead singer Romeo Stodart reaches for
    Chris Martin's now-ubiquitous falsetto-- ""forev<em>er</em> lost -- and
    shit, that kinda works, too. In between, the natural harmonies of the
    band's two brother-sister pairings chart the kind of melody most
    indie-pop groups would kill stuffed animals for. Handclaps ensue. If
    the reference points are a tad obvious, so is the song's appeal.</p><p>
    
    To say the Magic Numbers are instantly accessible is not to say
    they're simplistic. The album's most emotionally charged number, the
    six-minute ""I See You, You See Me"", casts a vulnerable duet of
    self-discovery amid ever-shifting dynamics. Ornate, country-tinged
    guitar fills enliven several songs, particularly ""Long Legs"". Often,
    multiple voices will bat key lyrics back and forth like
    rainbow-colored beach balls, until they become a sort of joyful,
    lovelorn mantra-- a Polyphonic Spree for normals. The lonesome twang
    of ""Wheels on Fire"" hints at the great Parsons-Harris duets, though
    this slick album version lacks the intimacy of the leaked demo you'll
    find on file-sharing networks.  Mostly, though, the Magic Numbers are
    just clean fun, from the banjo-like guitar romp of ""Morning's Eleven""
    to the uptempo, tambourine-crashing power-pop of ""Love Me Like You"".</p><p>
    
    So: Why not an even higher score, you ask? Though the Numbers'
    refreshing style merits the oft-made Mamas-and-the-Papas comparisons
    as well as the AAA allusions, they don't have anything close to a
    ""California Dreaming"". The songwriting falls a couple of times too
    many into timid generalities about love and loss (cf. ""Love Is a
    Game"", which isn't a Michelle Branch/Santana cover); the melodies,
    though lovely, are sometimes interchangeable. ""One more drink and I'll
    be fine/ One more girl to take you off my mind,"" Stodart sings on
    ""Mule"", but it sounds like a feeling remembered from someone else's
    song rather than something he's experienced. Yes, the Magic Numbers
    are easy to love -- but until they grow into their considerable gifts
    is it OK if I just really, really like them?</p></div>"|5648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5648-the-magic-numbers/|7.6|Marc Hogan

That project was documented on the double-disc set <em>Kompakt 100, and although it wasn't the celebratory dancefloor melter that it probably should've been, its central selling point of hot us-on-us action felt tastefully in line with Kompakt's hermetically sealed sensibilities. If, as a label, you're more into the idea of creating a city than you are reflecting one, this is a good way of doing things.</em></p><p>
    At the opposite end of the spectrum is Berlin's Bpitch Control, whose utilitarian and far-reaching choices have probably come at the expense of a more streamlined label identity. That's not to say that Bpitch-- helmed and founded by German techno matriarch Ellen Allien-- hasn't been as discerning over the years, but rather that they've been more willing to branch out. Nowhere is that more evident than on the label's own celebratory retrospective, <em>Camping.</em></p><p>
    A simple mix-and-match of the best cuts from the label's discography, <i>Camping</i> showcases six years worth of permutations of Berlinesque techno and techno-pop. From the goofy basslines of Housemeister's ""Do You Wanna Funk"" and the gloopy vocodered pop of Smash TV's ""Sad"" to the razor-sharp techno of Feadz' ""Lt Replay"" and the persistent glitch of Modeselektor's ""Don't Panic"", it pole vaults from one style to another, with only a steadfastly Germanic spirit holding it together.</p><p>
    Fittingly, a few of the compilation's best cuts come from Allien herself. Even in their truncated forms, ""Wish"" and ""Sechsucht"" (two standouts from her excellent 2003 full-length <i>Berlinette</i>) rank among the best things here. Other highlights include the widescreen disco synth stabs of Kiki's massive-sounding 2002 single ""Luv Sikk"", the bizarro back porch flourishes of Hal 9000 &amp; Sylvie Marks' recent ""Blütenspa\xDF"", and the New Order-aping synthpop of Sascha Funke's smoldering 2001 cover of ""When Will I Be Famous"". Of course, there are some misfires here as well (<em>Camping suffers from being a bit bottom-heavy), but this is mostly a competent overview of Bpitch's healthy discography and a modest portrait of a label that has always been willing to go as far as Berlin has been willing to take it.</em></p></div>"|2086.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2086-camping/|7.3|Mark Pytlik

    great one. Instead, the Chicago-based quintet felt the need to <em>make
    a statement</em>, and after the initial cochlea-tease of ""Western
    Avenue"" and ""Heart &amp; Soul"", <em>Hello More</em> spends 20-some
    precious minutes emphasizing to the listener that the band's
    imagination is too eclectic for catchy-ass electro pop alone.</p><p>
    
    I'm seeing ""Western Avenue"" as the A-side. The schmaltzy drum machine
    that limps all over the record works better than elsewhere in this
    melodic, structured context: Muted guitar chords chomp rhythmically at
    the splashy mechanical beat like small teeth, and Ed Anderson's
    cool falsetto coasts through a foursquare, Gibbardesque melody (yeah,
    I said it). The crisp dynamic shifts and organized flourishes whet
    your appetite for more of the same, especially during the radiant
    synth pinwheels of the chorus. The variegated beats, lush guitar
    pulses, cleanly shifting intensities, and svelte vocals of ""Heart &amp;
    Soul"" further elevate these high hopes.</p><p>
    
    It's especially frustrating that the two winners are sequenced right
    at the beginning of the album (after the brief overture ""Compass
    Tape""), so that they trick you into thinking you're in for a
    consistent experience. Not so; the remainder of the record is wildly
    erratic in every aspect, even recording quality, and it sounds more
    like defensive experimentation than deliberate variation. It's like
    taking a couple bites of a tasty peanut butter and jelly sandwich,
    only to find subsequent bites getting all avant-garde with ham, then
    onions, then sardines, then Legos.</p><p>
    
    If a dynamite single wasn't enough, they even could have stretched it
    to a solid EP. On ""Rope"", Edgar Legzdins replaces Anderson's bright, silky falsetto
    with a drearier register, but it's a passable bit of silly-robot
    motorik homage. The straightforward emoting, acoustic strummage and
    injured guitar leads of the title track are nice enough; and even
    ""Please Save My Body From the Modern World"", with its goofy drum
    patterns, spongy bass throb and feel-good rock vocal could've worked
    on an EP, as a tacked-on ""Hey look at this wacky thing we made on the
    fly haha we're crazy dudes"" song. </p><p>
    
    But all this excellence and decency is occluded by stillborn fragments
    that seem a slap in the face to Plane's songwriting chops. ""Party
    Train"" is among the most interesting of these, tremoloed guitars
    wending through a rhythmic chassis of German vocal samples and jerky
    drums. ""It's What I Like, Dear"" and ""Adams"" both sound like partial
    demos of uninspired indie rock songs, and ""Broken Woods"" is a low-carb
    Animal Collective substitute. I guess Plane made whatever statement
    they needed to make, but from a listener's perspective, <em>Hello

Not to sound like an insensitive, sanctimonious aficionado, but <em>The Bends</em>, <em>OK Computer, and <i>Kid A</i> have probably been abused in more high school parties than anything some 25-year-old dude down the block sells. Enter <i>Strange We Should Meet Here</i>, that guy sporting an Old Navy Performance Fleece, driving his Ford Mustang, wearing his visor upside-down and popping his collar to a party mix that juxtaposes ""Karma Police"" with ""Mr. Jones"" and some Limp Bizkit track.</em></p><p>
    
    Then again, what's to be expected from two teens fresh out of high school, gallivanting around a Seattle scene growing more infamous for its kitsch bands than famous for its rock legends? The duo, consisting of singer Michael Harris and versatile instrumentalist Daniel Anderson, reaches for a <em>Kid A aesthetic and produces just that-- a hollow, superficial burlesque of laptop pop and space rock with none of the emotion, innovation, and flat-out substance that a band like Radiohead spew out in their sleep. Of course, condemning this record for its inferiority to Radiohead would be downright unethical, but this is no Hood or Elbow caliber aping; it's bastardization on par with Keane or Athlete.</em></p><p>
    
    First red flag: ""A Day in the Life of a Poolshark"", which opens with harmless keyboard arpeggios, quickly turns to stale grunge electronica before degenerating to a scream-laden outro reminiscent of Linkin Park. Harris's Jekyll/Hyde singing style becomes increasingly arduous during the album as one moment he's emulating Thom Yorke's subtlest idiosyncrasies (right down to singing ""skin"" as ""ski-yayn"") and another he's shredding his vocal chords, screaming incoherently.</p><p>
    
    Stuff really goes to shit by ""Morerae (The Locust)"", a pop culture dumpster beginning with a voicemail sample (""End of message, to erase this message, press '7'"") and setting the stage for ""Militance Prom"", Idiot Pilot's foray into, ahem, rap. That's right, amidst all the IDM ambience and droning, soporific vocals, Harris decides to drop some rhymes he wrote while not paying attention in social studies: ""Yo check this/ I'm-a chill like the cubes of ice/ When I mention Calcutta ya'll feel the spice/ As I roll with a two-tone cellular phone/ And get blown like inflation."" It's beyond ""rip-off."" It's beyond ""poseur."" It doesn't even know what the fuck it wants to be. It's just two kids with way too much access to recording equipment, the musical equivalent of a monkey with a hand grenade.</p></div>"|4161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4161-strange-we-should-meet-here/|3.5|Adam Moerder

Just about every thunder clap on the snare, prick of the guitar string, amniotic keyboard melody, weathered-vinyl hum, and synthesizer blurt flows into a gutter-- disintegrating bit by bit in the runoff. When the Montreal artist released <i>Wild Life Documentaries</i> in 2002, his miles-deep bass and snare-chipped rhythms remained faithful to Kingston at a time when so many laptop-bohos took Pole's ""digital dub"" premise and thoroughly sterilized it.</p><p> 
    
    While dub is typically revered for its clockwork rhythm that snaps the mind into a trance, what is heard between the beats and the notes matter just as much. In the <em>Wild Life and its equally hypnotic follow-up, <i>Something Borrowed, Something Blue</i>, Montieth found uncanny beauty in the rainwater effect as his music evoke the sensation of brain synapses struggling to recall vague memories amid a narcotic haze. Cynics could dismiss Montieth's much of sleek electro-percussion and glossy synth flourishes as mere filler for Hollywood suspension flicks. However, Montieth still taps into a netherworld of disjointed time, place and memory that intoxicates as much as enchants, all deftly proven in </em><em>New World Observer</em>.</p><p>
    
    The ""new world"" as presented in Montieth's latest LP is impossible to determine. The atmospherics are darker than on his previous joints; the grooves are more fractured and uneasy. A weariness pervades here, as personified by the watercolors dripped by guest vocalist Athesia. Judging by a few song titles, Montieth is drawing illustrations of a Middle East damaged by the grave contradictions of U.S. foreign policy with a broken charcoal pencil and blood-smeared fingertips. ""Abu Ghraib"" begins with a distorted sample of Rush Limbaugh whitewashing the damning photos of American servicemen torturing and humiliating Iraqi detainees for pleasure. After comparing such sadism to frat-boy play, the apologist asked his listeners, ""Have you ever heard of emotional release?"" to which another voice, possibly Montieth's, snaps an echoing ""fuck off."" Montieth then sears the ears with a rooftop rain-synth patch before undergoing a loose groove by brushed snare and conga, in tosses visages of a melody back and forth as if debating itself.</p><p>
    
    ""Little Town of Bethlehem"" also addresses Middle East politics with an excerpt from an interview of a Palestinian woman recalling the violent entry of an Israeli-Jewish settlement near her town. It's followed by a mournful, minor-key piano ballad with a bassline brooding in the distance, avoiding any crescendo or climax in continuing to walk and mind its own business. Montieth better translated his anxieties and hopes for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in <i>Wild Life</i>, on which his sparse rhythms and desolate atmospherics all seemed to view Israeli streets through a police night-vision camera.  Opener ""Slow Rot from Rhetoric"" solidifies the album's sense of exhausted dreams with a inching, death march beat and organ melodies that veer through the stereo speakers like hallucinated angels waiting for souls to leave the earth.</p><p>
    
    For the most part, Montieth's rhythms thankfully break away from his live, but auto-piloted grooves and dwells in post-Timbaland ethno-hop territory. Flamenco rhythms curl the beat and Athesia's crooned French syllables on ""Port-Au-Prince"", while they jolt the bones on the uptempo jaunt ""Texas Tea"". On ""Rock of Ages"", Montieth liquidates a splashing hi-hat on an otherwise generic dub number.</p><p>
    
    Closer ""Habitat for Heavy Hearts"" has Montieth superimposing a field recording of crickets over synth drones ladled from the ether. By the album's end, it is unclear if he was in a ""new world"" to begin with, given that he generally keeps his music within the same formula of brooding and digitally smeared dub since 2002. One might consider <em>New World Observer</em> as the blues for a homeless soul in a world distorted by mass media. If anything, Montieth seems to be one of those angels following the death march; taking the hand of fallen souls to another place that has one question a previous life on earth more than celebrate its escape from it.

On one hand, it's refreshing to hear these eccentrics dressed like their tyke selves in the early 80s throw together hip-hop and folkie-pop like found-art objects strewn in dumpsters and attics. It was quite a sight watching an Anticon showcase at San Francisco's Amoeba Music back in 2001, where the ""indie kids"" in patch 'n' retro badge-clad hoodies bobbed their heads in the front, while many b-boys stood in the back with crossed arms or passed through the record bins as if listening to a PA'd CD. Audience polarization can be a sign of artistic strength, but what happens when an artist's idiosyncrasies and self-indulgences are accepted as qualities of predictable freaks? What more could be expected of him or her?</p><p>
    
    When Yoni Wolf emerged as Why?, he was respected as a b-boy who never raps and is often with  a beat-up, acoustic guitar in his hand. His nasal whine makes his scribblings in a public bus commute notebooks like ""Or in the cramped, corpse-like blue of an airplane bathroom"" in the Piano Man-fashioned ballad, ""Sick 2 Think"" somehow charming and digestible. His EP, <em>Sanddollars, contains more weirdness-for-weirdness' sake ditties that narrate the lives of sad sacks or sing of existential angst tuneful enough to entertain elementary school assemblies. The vaguely Brian Wilson-esque harmonies manage to keep the listener grounded as the entertaining gobbledygook passes by.</em></p><p>
    
    The strongest tracks begin and end the record; both raise half-drunk pints to hopeless dreamers and has-beens. Opener ""Miss Ohio's Nameless"" tells of a beauty contestant with the voice of an angel who gets some Internet buzz, but still doesn't go beyond open-mic night and the funeral home. As expected, this piano 'n' brushed snare ballad for any homecoming dance just had to be introduced by some Deadbeat-style digital rainfall and random TV chatter. Closer ""Mutant John"" is about (I humbly assess) an artist's one and only fan or mutantjohn@hotmail.com. Here Why? laments ""And I've been living like a (what sounds like ""bend"") of ones since like my second and final Tupperware party"" and ""But then I've been giving a flying fuck about my melancholcity."" Quite clever. And then he veers into Weezer-seque whimpering. It's difficult to know whether to laugh at or pity the bloke.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <em>Sanddollars is all very cute and well-orchestrated piano-pop; something to bring home for ma. Wolf describes the ATL that ""smells like dead possums,"" where his friend found a dead butterfly and surprised him by placing it on his keyboard during sound check in the Beach Boys-fashioned hymn ""Next Atlanta"". Lines that mention buying 20 bucks of Cheerios and glow-in-the-dark Legos somehow figure in. ""Pantone Cyan"" and ""500 Fingernails"" both glide on a Neu-ish motorik beat with verses shoving choruses, while the title track is prances around the Maypole until the joyous irony wears off for most hepcats and we're left with Wolf dancing with himself for hours on end, no matter that everyone went home.</em></p><p>
    
    Much too safe.</p></div>"|8671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8671-sanddollars-ep/|6.6|Cameron Macdonald

With their proclivity towards both unapologetic noise and simple, repetitive song structures, Long Beach duo DDM, formerly Dance Disaster Movement, have been stuck in purgatory between the more leftfield dance-punk acts and the genre's dance floor darlings.</p><p>
    
    That's not to say DDM march to the beat of their own drum-- instead, they march to a uniform beat for five minutes at a time, lacking the confidence and ingenuity to throw in a clever turn or slick breakdown. Critics and listeners alike claimed this monotony as their biggest beef with 2003's LP <i>We Are from Nowhere</i>, and DDM make minor adjustments to this major problem on <em>Snow on the TV. ""Get Back on the Starting Line"", the EP's first track after 55-second opener ""A Squared"", proves as much a retrograde version of ""Out of the Races and onto the Tracks"" as its title suggests. The song kicks off with thumping bass drum and male locker room chanting-- so far so good-- and then, after only 15 seconds, the band seemingly switches to autopilot, allowing Kevin Disco (ah, I get it, like </em><em>disco-punk!) to spew out half-baked poetry and Jon Spencer-affected yelps.</em></p><p>
    
    Perhaps the multi-instrumental Disco's got his talents spread too thin. He's still failing to realize his Arp Omni keyboard's potential, using it to produce digital vomit rather than anything remotely interesting. I understand DDM's shtick is predicated on punk buzzwords like ""visceral"" and ""in-your-face"", but why on ""Hello"" are they continuously regurgitating their garbage noise beat as if it's the next ""Hey Ya!""? But hey, as a consolation prize DDM at least offer up ""Turn 'On' On"", the first successful fusion of their many, widely publicized influences. It's a bit ESG, a bit PiL, a bit A Certain Ratio, yadda yadda yadda. What's most important, though, is the fact it takes off after the first promising, pounding 15 seconds rather than leaning on a bass drum beat for four minutes. Maybe considering this EP a single with six b-sides would leave me less disappointed, but as a follow-up to <i>Snow on the TV</i>, DDM sounds DOA.</p></div>"|2609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2609-snow-on-the-tv-ep/|6.4|Adam Moerder

    under the umbrella of their main projects.  Compared to other artists', Damon Albarn's playroom chest must be filled to bursting:
    the cultural drawer cluttered with horror films, anime, and rock'n'roll stereotypes; the musical drawer crammed full of dub, hip-hop,
    dancehall, and afropop.  In fact, Albarn seems to have so many creative distractions tempting his muse, he can't even keep them from
    occasionally invading the conservative environs of his day job-- each Blur album manages to squeeze in at least one ill-fitting
    endeavor like <i>Think Tank</i>'s ""Crazy Beat"".</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, Gorillaz provides Albarn an outlet to vent his taste for sci-fi kitsch, and satiate his urge to break free from rock
    with guitars-- and it's a surprisingly successful outlet, at that.  (Did anyone really expect an edgy street-cred Banana Splits to
    be worth discussing four years into its discography?)  Rather than falling flat, Gorillaz have strangely become a therapeutic and
    clever way for Albarn to subvert the usual egolympics associated with a solo project.  Coyly hiding behind Jamie Hewlett's
    thick-inked pop caricatures and a phalanx of guest stars, Gorillaz allows Albarn to practice self-indulgence under heavy personality
    camouflage-- though never so heavy that there's any question as to who's really pulling the strings.</p><p>
    
    Like the Gorillaz's self-titled debut, <em>Demon Days goes the way of most auteur projects, its oversize idea load making for a
    trip equal parts peak and valley.  But also like the debut, </em><em>Demon Days is better than it has any right to be, featuring
    singles stronger than anything released under the Blur banner since, you know, that ""Woo-hoo"" song.  For a project that could
    easily have been little more than <i>Damon Albarn Remakes ""Ghost Town"" 15 Times (With More Rapping &amp; Cartoons)</i>, this is a
    follow-up that proves Gorillaz, weirdly, has legs-- not that the four-year break hurt any.</em></p><p>
    
    In order to keep things fresh, however, Albarn made a few exchanges at the hip-hop Wal-Mart, trading in his sputtering old Dan the
    Automator model for Danger ""as seen on CNN!"" Mouse, and swapping out Del tha Funkee Homosapien for MF Doom and... Dennis Hopper.
    These new collaborators add more to the proceedings than just increasing the comic-dork factor by about 10, particularly Danger
    Mouse, whose colorfully dense production helps buoy the occasionally slight genre sketches scripted by Albarn and his fleet of
    retro keyboards.</p><p>
    
    For most of the album, Danger Mouse &amp; Albarn make like they're Dario Argento &amp; Goblin, to the point that this <i>Fangoria</i>
    neophyte can't tell the difference between the sampled zombie-flick scores and the facsimile ones (I'm pretty sure ""Last Living
    Souls"" is the former).  Obviously, this agenda cues me to resort to adjectives like ""foreboding,"" ""ominous,"" and ""sinister,"" but
    Albarn can't help making his haunted house a discotheque.  As with the standouts from the debut album, the best tracks here strike
    a unique balance between slacker detachment and dance-floor bounce: ""Feel Good Inc."" swerves through an anxious bassline to a choice
    De La Soul drive-by, while ""DARE"" defibrillates Shaun Ryder to shout along while Albarn channels Prince's synths and falsettos.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there are a few blown-up test tubes amid the successful experiments, too: undercooked genre dalliances (the robo-punk
    ""White Light""), a few dull, unfortunately frontloaded Xanax lopes (""Kids With Guns"", ""O Green World""), and the truly bizarre
    (Hopper's once-is-enough spoken word on ""Fire Coming Out of a Monkey's Head""). Albarn also occasionally gets too distracted trying
    on the outfits of other bands, like on Beach Boys replicant ""Don't Get Lost in Heaven"", and fires his one radio dud with his second
    shrine to Clint Eastwood, a collaboration with Booty Brown and a children's choir called ""Dirty Harry"".</p><p>
    
    On the album-closing title track, the appearance of a choir genuinely works, accomplishing the amazing task of being the <i>second</i>
    time (after ""Tender"") that Albarn has gotten away with effectively employing that ultimate lazy rock add-on.  In fact, if the Gorillaz
    concept achieves anything beyond keeping Hewlett employed and producing some snazzy videos and websites, it's proving that Albarn
    can successfully wield the sonic toys he's mostly kept partitioned apart from his flesh band.  Though the results of his exuberant
    mixing and matching are uneven at times, Albarn's obsessions fit together just often enough to again make Gorillaz more than mere
    Adult Swim novelty.</p></div>"|3526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3526-demon-days/|6.9|Rob Mitchum

Or is it the doom? The sludge, maybe? Cultish designation depends on hair length and drugs taken. The point is, with 1993's <em>Earth 2, Carlson and his collaborators created a no-motion masterpiece of sub-tonal metal. Its three tracks range between quarter-hour and half. They consume the Melvins, and splay Godflesh out to dry in the sun. <i>Earth 2</i> adds 40,000 ""f""'s onto the end of ""riff,"" and the result drags right off the page. ""Humans are present only as audience or operators."" That's what the Survival Research Laboratories mission statement says. But it applies to Earth, too, 'cause this shit is a stoned and illuminated manuscript. God is not a DJ. He is an amplifier.</em></p><p>
<i>Legacy of Dissolution is a remix project that gathers six of Earth's most important cult members. Sanctioned by Carlson and released as a joint venture between the mighty Southern Lord and Philly's No Quarter (home of Earth's 2002 live compendium </i><i>Sunn Amps and Smashed Guitars</i>), <em>Dissolution features contributions from Mogwai, Russell Haswell, Jim O'Rourke, Autechre, Justin Broadrick, and SunnO))), the last of which famously began as an Earth cover band. (Name: Mars.) Results vary, but the overall feel is a not-unpleasant sense of thudding dread. Like, ""I don't understand this, but I want to lay in it."" </em></p><p>
    The original ""Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine"" is 27-minute pulse for guitar and bass. Mogwai manipulates that into a singular hovering tone, dropping in the plodding original recording at the four-minute mark over electronic triggers and its own manipulated atmosphere. It's Coil's <i>Angelic Conversation</i>, stuck on an ellipsis. Like Jim O'Rourke's lengthy meditation on the title track to Earth's <i>Phase 3: Thrones and Dominions</i>, it's difficult to call what Mogwai's doing metal. But the source material isn't metal, anyway. It's something stranger, maybe more modal; maybe even louder. <i>Legacy of Dissolution</i> proves the spectacular reach of experimental music-- whether it's Earth or Isis or Kammerflimmer Kollektief, it's open to interpretation.</p><p>
    Reinterpret they do. Russell Haswell's ""Tibetan Quaaludes [Waveset Sloth Mix]"" runs the original's solitary resonating guitar through some kind of horrible and scary processing program \xD0 the garbled, lurching, and totally fantastic result sounds like a sadistic biker movie on the wrong speed. Autechre retains the main riff of ""Coda Maestoso in F [Flat] Minor"" (from Earth's last official album, 1996's <em>Pentastar: In the Style of Demons). However their version is slowly taken over by reflective plinking until there's only that bass line, the one built for stoned head nodding. The final, epic section will make David Gilmour weep openly.</em></p><p>
<i>Legacy of Dissolution</i>'s final position is owned by SunnO))). Its sixteen minutes are probably the closest this set gets to Earth's original template; like their origins, it feels more like a tribute than a remix. But ""Rule the Divine [Mysteria Caelestis Mugiv]"" is one of the collection's strongest moments, a dreary roar of open maw guitars and the echoes of drums from some far off cavern. This is sludge; this is primordial. Then at about six minutes in, things drop out. A pause, and then the report of one guitar. This goes on for awhile, and you might forget yourself. But then it's back, a monstrous squalling tone coming from the amp where God lives, and He's angry. Well, what are you going to do about it, stoner? </p></div>"|2924.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2924-legacy-of-dissolution/|7.8|Johnny Loftus

    scope of ideas, innovation, eclecticism, musicianship, songwriting, 
    commercial aims. De Novo Dahl's first 
    record is 
    about as boldly ambitious as a band's first steps can get, and while 
    it's 
    not exactly a masterpiece, it's certainly not for lack of trying. De Novo Dahl are so eager to make an impact with their debut that they 
    give 
    it to you twice-- once in relatively straightforward, though never 
    mundane, 
    pop-rock arrangements (<em>Cats) and again in a remixed, resequenced and 
    retitled form (</em><em>Kittens).</em></p><p>
    
    The LP consists of 16 songs each presented twice in wildly divergent forms; as such, it takes a couple of listens 
    for the 
    full impact of it to sink in. Heck, the first time I 
    listened I 
    didn't even notice the remix conceit, so different are the remixes from 
    their counterparts, though it was clear something was up based on the 
    crazy 
    mix of styles and sounds on <i>Kittens</i> relative to the unified, focused 
    <i>Cats</i>. 
    By the second listen, I had cheated and consulted the one-sheet and 
    since 
    then it's been fun determining which tracks correspond to which, not to 
    mention taking in the dizzying array of sounds the band cooks up to 
    throw at 
    you.</p><p>
    
    For the sake of quick reference, I'd say the best aesthetic precedent 
    for 
    <em>Cats &amp; Kittens</em>, at least in terms of the mix of styles, is Super Furry 
    Animals' <em>Guerrilla, an album that similarly tossed big-hooked guitar 
    pop, 
    electronic weirdness, and anglo funk into the same salad. Like I said, 
    <i>Cats</i> 
    is a fairly unified, focused album in its own right, though the band's 
    sense 
    of weirdness does burst through on occasions like the spontaneous burst 
    of 
    laughter on ""Monday Morning"". Mostly, though, <i>Cats</i> is stuffed with 
    cranking 
    indie pop anchored by a solid rhythm section and topped by keyboards 
    and the 
    spirited interaction of three different vocalists.</em></p><p>
    
    Highlights from the first disc include the opener, ""All Over Town"", 
    which 
    follows infectious, pumping verses with a huge chorus backed by 
    grinding 
    lead guitar phrases. The band's great sense of dynamics is on full 
    display 
    on ""I Woke Up Late"", with verses full of boy-boy-girl harmonies and 
    bouncing 
    bass alternating with big, surprising multi-tracked choral passages and 
    sections where the beat mostly drops out, leaving behind only 
    tambourine to 
    keep the time. Elsewhere, ""The Funk"" swerves between brightly melodic 
    disco 
    and crunchy rock without trying to be dance-punk, ""Piggy's Adventure"" 
    sports 
    David Carney's most ridiculously sweet bassline to back up Serai 
    Zaffiro's 
    spoken vocal, ""Be Your Man"" is all-out power pop stuffed with Marc 
    Bolan-esque ""oh-oh-oh""s and flurrying keyboards, and ""Conquest at 
    Midnight"" 
    is a loopy duet sung over Joey Andrews' propulsive drums and insistent 
    piano 
    rhythms.</p><p>
    
    It's a lot to take in, especially considering that there's a whole 
    second 
    disc we haven't even addressed yet. The <i>Kittens</i> material ranges from 
    exhilarating oddness to confounding electro-pop, but it's never boring 
    or 
    predictable. The rocketing, strutting power pop of ""Be Your Man"" 
    becomes 
    ""Wanna Beer Man?"", the crispy guitars stripping away in favor of 
    efficient 
    Teutonic synthpop, while ""Dinosaurs!"" discos up ""Jeffrey"" for something 
    that 
    sounds like the Flaming Lips backing a Travolta throw-down on a lighted 
    floor. ""Magic"" is like ELO colliding with Trio, while ""Rhythm, phd."" 
    is a 
    straight is a thumping dancefloor raver that shows the band can be 
    convincing even when dabbling.</p><p>
    
    The net impression left by the two discs of <em>Cats &amp; Kittens</em> is one of a 
    confident, talented band letting its collective imagination run wild, 
    deconstructing it own ideas and recycling them into something new. 
    It's 
    functionally two albums for the price of one and different people will 
    prefer different discs, but at any rate it's a damn impressive debut 
    overflowing with mostly realized ambition.</p></div>"|2611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2611-cats-kittens/|7.5|Joe Tangari

With a band name and B&amp;W;, Xerox-quality cover art that give this package the look of a generic hardcore 7"" from 1986, the Punks instead generate a rather impressive sequence of mesmeric drones and noisy, free-form improvisations, which-- given some of the album's sillier, crazed-toddler trappings-- are often performed with an astonishing degree of patience and subtlety.</p><p>
    
    Led by Kill Rock Stars chi eftain Slim Moon, the Punks feature a rather fluid lineup of musicians who utilize whatever instruments, stray materials, and recording space they can get their collective paws on to craft their amorphous, malformed ditties. On these 12 tracks-- only seven of which were deemed worthy of earning actual titles-- the group move quickly between various experimental forms like a restless Sunday school class who've been introduced to Black Dice and Excepter immediately prior to teacher's next smoke break.</p><p>
    
    In fact, Black Dice are here the possible beneficiaries of a brief, oblique homage, as the Punks borrow the title ""Beaches and Canyons"" for a wiggy, wordless a cappella piece that lands them somewhere between Cornelius Cardew's The Great Learning and a failed Monty Python rehearsal. Another brazen episode of title-swiping occurs on the very un-Snoop-like ""Drop It Like It's Hot"", an extended wave of drone sculpted from amp feedback, violin, and woodwinds that builds in gradual strength with the same resonant forethought as some of Keiji Haino's more subdued work.</p><p>
    
    Also displaying the Punks' surprisingly refined touch are tracks like ""Jean Travolta"", a winsome, evocative piece featuring piano, fiddle, and what sounds like an oboe, and the album's several unnamed instrumentals which each contain a bewildering assortment of stray, unknowable sound sources. Particularly effective are the group's more percussive numbers, which often begin with what sounds like the clatter of a several janitors simultaneously rattling their enormous key-rings before evolving into hypnotic No Neck Blues-style beat tribalism.</p><p>
    
    As delightful as the album's highlights are, however, they also serve to make the Punks' all-to-frequent (and seemingly willful) piss-takes feel even more frustrating. The opening ""Theme From John Chavez"", for example, crudely assembles a rickety drum machine behind squiggly vocals and random sound effects in a manner that seems as just likely to repel curious listeners as does to seduce them. And the inclusion of inconsequential should-be-outtakes like the 10-second scream of ""Turn Up the Awesome"" or the child's-eye musique concrete of ""Comida"" feels like idle indulgence. While these lesser cuts grow ever more automatically skippable with each subsequent playing, it'd never draw your notice if the rest of the album didn't so thoroughly reward every repeat visit.</p></div>"|6572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6572-thank-you-for-the-alternative-rock/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

I could 
    just be taking them way too seriously or my sense of humor could be 
    broken. An eight-piece rap crew from Wales known for cheap jewelry and 
    coining useful slang like ""soap bar"" and ""safe as fuck,"" they make their 
    U.S. debut with <em>Straight Outta Newport</em>. Their delivery is painful, 
    the beats are outdated and ridiculous, one of them sounds dead-on like 
    the Cookie Monster (and in the Muppet way, not the death metal vocals 
    way), and their humor is grade-school level-- no better than whatever you 
    may have laid down the first time you discovered a tape recorder. Am I 
    missing something? Are they the ones having the last laugh?</p><p>
    
    Maybe they're far more clever than I realize. Maybe they want to bring 
    us back to a more innocent time, a Golden Age of Novelty Rap, when 
    anybody could rap regardless of skill, from the Chicago Bears to Bart 
    Simpson to the Fresh Prince. In which case, their clumsy flow-- which makes 
    Mike Skinner look like Twista-- would be essential to the execution. A song 
    called ""Guns Don't Kill People, Rappers Do"" really would be best 
    delivered by a guy who sounds like Rik from ""The Young Ones"". It's 
    probably another clever layer when their strongest beat is saved for a track 
    called ""Your Mother's Got a Penis"". If you're curious how that one 
    goes, it's hard to miss: ""I can prove it cause I gave it a blow/ It was 
    purely accidental 'cause she got me really drunk/ And she made me kiss her 
    elephant trunk/ You know why?/ [pause] That's right/ [pause] Your mother's got a penis.""</p><p>
    
    But in between songs about hermaphroditic mothers and sex with 
    computers (""Half Man, Half Machine"") there's sincere songs like ""Roller Disco"", 
    which sounds like and is about just that. When they rap that they ""used 
    to listen to Public Enemy, Eric B and Rakim,"" I guess I should take 
    them at their word, even though none of it managed to rub off. For better 
    or worse-- ok, just worse-- there's no irony here; This really is the 
    best they could do. Too juvenile to be offensive, and too dull to milk 
    cheap laughs from playing into stereotype, Goldie Lookin' Chain make one 
    serious mistake in this novelty rap game: They're just not funny.</p></div>"|3674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3674-straight-outta-newport/|2.0|Jason Crock

    off 
    to do my laundry, and it's pretty clear that spring has sprung. (Hell, 
    given 
    that a few days ago it was pushing 90 and humid as Bonecrusher's 
    jockstrap, 
    we may have skipped spring and gone straight to July.) The sky is a 
    beautful, uh, sky blue, with only a handful of cottonball clouds 
    dotting it. 
    The leaves have exploded like paintball pellets against trees that only 
    a 
    few weeks ago were still bare. The bugs are hovering, somewhere in the 
    distance a lawnmower is buzzing, and I am drinking lemonade. In short, 
    it's 
    exactly the opposite of the mood conjured by Superpitcher's new mix 
    <em>Today</em>.</p><p>
    Superpitcher is house for mopers. He turns the dancefloor into one big 
    pity 
    party. Unlike other attempts at ""goth house"" (the brutalist Gallic 
    bombast 
    of Black Strobe or their forebears in EBM acts like Front242, for 
    instance), 
    he doesn't hammer you into submission like a camp Danzig hip to Derrick 
    May. 
    He sulks, like a scrawny teenager replaying ""Computer Love"" and ""Neon 
    Lights"" over and over to soothe a broken heart. In his own tracks like 
    ""Heroin"" and his remixes for artists like M83, he takes a trudging 
    mid-tempo 
    house pattern that seems to be pushing against its own inertia and 
    pickles 
    it in a brine of gloomy-yet-euphoric synths. Though <em>Today</em> contains only 
    one 
    of his own productions, it's definitely all of a piece. And if it 
    doesn't 
    contain individual tracks that hit the highs of Kompakt's previous 
    goth-mix 
    masterpiece, Michael Mayer's <em>Immer</em>, then as a mood muzik whole (imagine 
    a 
    train ride across the damp Germanic countryside) it's up there.</p><p>
    DJ Koze's ""Let's Help Me"" rustles and bustles along like the midway 
    point 
    between electrohouse and the uncomfortable intestinal intimacy of Jan 
    Jelinek's Farben productions. (I especially like the really thin, 
    almost 
    slivered hi-hats.) The lyrics and luded Nico (not an oxymoron, I swear) 
    delivery of Michael Mayer's ""Lovefood"" are so archly ridiculous (""give 
    me 
    love/ So I can/ Kill""...girl, please) that no remix can save it, except 
    perhaps 
    a total Aphexian overhaul. Triola's ""Leuchtturm (Wighnomy's Polarzipper 
    Remix)"" squelches and chirps at uncomfortable (p)op-art angles, 
    something 
    like a Depeche Mode B-side in dub. The compulsive bassline of Oliver 
    Hacke's 
    ""21:31"" gets peeled back by the jacking drums of the Psychonauts' 
    ""World 
    Keeps Turning (Highfish &amp; Zander Remix)"" with vocals straight out of 
    '85.
    </p><p>
    The old school techno jock of Nathan Fake's ""Dinamo"" sets up the 
    killer 
    tune of the whole mix, the Wighnomy Bros' ""Wurz + Blosee"". The masters 
    of 
    creative thrift throw all their weight on a hypnotic b-line that 
    maintains 
    an almost unbearable tension simply by skipping up or down an octave 
    after 
    eight bars. There's a secondary beat they drop around 2:30 in, but 
    mostly 
    it's just the bassline, leading you around the dancefloor like a pied 
    piper. 
    Max Mohr's ""Old Song"" sounds like jazz house played on particularly 
    rusty, 
    rattling set of traps. Even faded-- like an old photocopy-- the shock 
    of 
    hearing something so traditional sounding on Kompakt is thrilling. (The 
    matte synths that lurk in the back of the mix bring us closer to the 
    Kpakt 
    gold standard for wistful melodicism.) The chunky groove of Sebastian 
    Tellier's ""La Ritournelle"" almost sounds like broken beat, albeit 
    slower 
    (and less broken). Soundtrack strings and AOR ballad pianos attempt to 
    briefly rouse our spirits. I am glad someone remembered that everybody 
    loves 
    the sunshine.

    release and a B-side. It's an opportunity to reward the people who 
    bothered to show up, and a chance to put out music that one wouldn't 
    necessarily want to keep in the catalog or worry about distributing through more traditional channels. 
    Dan 
    Snaith's Caribou is currently winding across North America 
    (definitely worth checking out, by the way) and they've brought with 
    them this odd little object, which combines a lengthy DJ mix by Snaith 
    with six <i>The Milk of Human Kindness</i> outtakes.</p><p>
    
    On a DJ set by a songwriter the tendency it to listen for influence, to 
    see if he'll tip his hand and I'll catch a nicked drum beat or 
    appropriated chord change. Snaith's mix doesn't exactly deliver in 
    that regard, but it does explain why he was fated to break away from 
    the 
    melancholy, Warp-influenced electronica of his debut. Among other 
    things, 
    his mix contains obscure pop from the 1960s and 70s, outsized songs with 
    big voices delivering direct statements, and it's difficult to see how such 
    obsessions could lead one down the introspective path of <i>Start Breaking 
    Your Heart</i>.</p><p>
    
    It's a diverse mix, though, and in addition to pop 
    nuggets from the Zombies, he tosses in jazz (Albert Ayler and Alice 
    Coltrane), proggy instrumentals, 80s Euro-disco, rare groove funk, and 
    some solo steel string guitar. The arc of the set generally is rather 
    flat, offering a sampling of interesting sounds rather than building or 
    moving in any particular direction, more along the lines of 36 minutes 
    of eclectic free form radio.</p><p>
    
    The six new songs are a tribute to Snaith's editing abilities with 
    albums proper. Though they tread similar stylistic ground, these tracks 
    are nowhere near as developed as the material that wound up on <i>The Milk 
    of Human Kindness</i>, so you'll hear loud echoes of tracks that made the 
    final cut while understanding why these were left behind. ""Bloody 
    Murder"" goes hard on the dramatic piano tone used to great effect on 
    ""Pelican Narrows"", pounding the tense mood imparted by the refrain into 
    the ground, but this feels like a fragment of an idea that just hangs 
    in 
    the air. ""The Snow Capes"" has a splashy drum pattern (Snaith loves his 
    crash cymbal, and we love him for it) with a cyclical keyboard melody 
    that, repetitive as it is, would work better as a short interlude. 
    ""Medium Sized Working Dog (Steady Steady)"" feels more complete, sharing 
    the interlaced guitar/drum motorik groove with ""Bees"" and ""Yeti"" before 
    veering off into Moog-ed out psych during its break. Though it overlaps 
    too closely with the best tracks on <i>The Milk of Human Kindness</i>, ""Medium 
    Sized Working Dog (Steady Steady)"" could stand on its own.</p><p>
    
    The tracks that moves furthest afield from <i>TMOHK</i> are the three-minute 
    drone ""Raspberries"", which swirls together various keyboards and 
    oscillators into an unsatisfying approximation of a Boredoms space 
    filler, and the wistful closer ""Sinuses"", which sounds like a <i>Start 
    Breaking Your Heart</i> B-side and shows that Snaith could still bring the 
    pastoral IDM if he were so inclined. Even if it's a bit light on 
    standalone pleasures, <i>Tour CD 2005</i> is instructive, showing where Snaith 
    comes from while fleshing out the story his last record.</p></div>"|1804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1804-tour-cd-2005/|5.7|Mark Richardson

She's the type of wildly idiosyncratic artist who inspires mixed metaphors and even mixed-er reactions: the songs on her third full-length, <i>Kidnapped By Neptune, </i>are bold crayon scrawls over the road and tire marks across the page. Whereas the musicians to whom she's most often compared-- Chan Marshall, PJ Harvey, even Björk-- are certainly adventurous, Niblett herself is reckless, charging haphazardly ahead where others might hesitate. That eccentric abandon, of course, has just as many pitfalls as windfalls: The highs on Kidnapped are incredibly high, the lows very low, and there's not much in between.</p>
<p>Like those on <i>Sweet Heart Fever and </i><i>I Am</i>, the stripped-down songs on <i>Kidnapped</i> change direction frequently and move by larks and whims, according to a logic known only to Niblett herself. At the album's most extreme moments, when knowing that logic might give listeners a clue to just what the heck she's trying to say, she sounds aloof, even defensive. After the shouted invocation of the muse that begins ""Safety Pants"", she repeats the same question-- ""C'mon honey what are you doing to me?""-- 28 times. Niblett might say that the tack evokes the insistence of uncertainty, the constant doubt caused by a manipulative lover, but for listeners it's simply ""C'mon honey what are you doing to me?"" 28 times over, starting from and finally arriving at not much at all.</p>
<p>But elsewhere, Niblett's caginess and self-indulgence produce music with a powerful impact. Over the earthy blues riff on ""Pom-Poms"", she asks ""Does anyone know a cute girl with some pom-poms?"" who can cheer her up and cheer her on. About halfway through, the guitar drops out and a shuffling drum beat takes it place, picking up the tempo as she cheers her herself up all alone. At two and a half minutes, ""Relax"" is relatively short-- an aside, really-- but the combination of her raw voice and her simple fretwork makes for one of the album's most quietly effective moments. Unfortunately, she breaks the spell on the next song, ""Valvoline"", which again substitutes guitar with loud drums but also replaces the immediacy of ""Relax"" with a cloying annoyance of aimless discordance.</p>
<p>But that's how <i>Kidnapped</i> works, by contrasting extremes: songs pit the prismatic mellifluousness of Niblett's voice against churning guitar rumble, the otherworldliness of her astrology-inspired lyrics against the urgent pounding of rudimentary drums, introverted hush against extroverted noise, frustrating detachment against uncomfortable proximity. ""Hot to Death"" builds from an almost a capella intro to Chris Saligoe's heavy guitar, like an iron butterfly emerging from its cocoon. And ""Lullaby for Scout in Ten Years"" interrupts its lull for bursts of guitar, adding a little fury to Niblett's future self. These extremes can be compelling as well as tiring over the course of <i>Kidnapped</i>, but when Niblett asks herself ""Are you still a chauffeur, driving your body around?"" you can't help but hope she doesn't drive off the page.</p></div>"|5787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5787-kidnapped-by-neptune/|6.8|Stephen M.

    City comes from nowhere to release a dynamite single with just the 
    right mix of hip 80s influences, gets the press talking, gets a sliver of 
    radio play, performs at SXSW, and finally releases an album that fails 
    to live up to that first three minutes of excitement.</p><p>
    
    In this case, what a single it is-- ""Hey Now Now"" opens the Cloud Room's self-titled debut with a 
    minimal guitar lick that's so familiar you can't place it, moves into 
    rapidly-strummed acoustic guitars and fey vocals robbed from your favorite 
    Smiths and Echo and the Bunnymen albums, and brings in perky keyboards 
    in the chorus with a climbing vocal melody and lyrics so foolish 
    they're brilliant (""Hey now now, we're goin' downtown/ And we ride the bus 
    there, pay the bus fare""), all delivered so infectiously it's near 
    delirium.</p><p>
    
    The handclaps and subtle, watery keys of ""Blackout!"" come close to that 
    level, as does the effortlessly catchy chorus to ""Beautiful Mess"", but 
    the rest of <em>The Cloud Room</em> underachieves.
    Singer ""J."" is reminiscent of a tired Ian MCculloch or a less-dramatic 
    David Bowie (they did name a track ""Blue Jean"", after all), his higher 
    registers on songs like ""Sunlight Song"" just as relaxing as his monotone. The 
    Cloud Room don't have anyone pushing the buttons at the right moments 
    in the production room-- when the seams show in songs like 
    ""Blackout!"", devoid of studio gloss or even vocal overdubbing, there's neither 
    a flat performance nor cringing moments of overambition, just a 
    happy-to-be-there karaoke grin.</p><p>
    
    Their naivete is endearing, but 
    it's difficult to shake the feeling that you've not only heard these 
    songs before, they were played more passionately. If only they were just 
    a little more ambitious and written something quite as good as the 
    opening track. Still, it's early for the band, and if they get so excited 
    about the mundane details of travel (""paaaaaaaaayed the bus 
    faaaaaaaare!""), then maybe touring outside of New York will give them more material 
    as worthy as ""Hey Now Now"".</p></div>"|1723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1723-the-cloud-room/|6.6|Jason Crock

I am a Hal 2005 computer. I became
    operational in the early 2000s at the Hal plant in Kiliney, Ireland.
    My producer was ex-Tears for Fears member Ian Stanley, and he taught
    me to sing songs. If you'd like to hear them, I can sing them for you.
    I'm programmed to simulate the finest of your human musicians: The
    Beach Boys, the Byrds, and <em>Breakfast in America</em>-era Supertramp.</p><p>
    
    My debut long-player, <em>Hal</em>, is full of serious songs with sunny,
    heavily polished arrangements. West Coast, Dave. On 2004 single
    ""Worry About the Wind"", a sober soft-rock ballad, the Phil
    Spector-style reverb typical of British nostalgists builds into a
    horn-laden coda. The lyrics are programmed for optimal universality:
    ""I'll worry about the wind/ You worry about the rain."" You may also
    have heard bombastic opener ""What a Lovely Dance"", another 2004
    single. The words: ""What a special night / wasn't thinkin' 'bout what
    was wrong, but what was""-- yes. Listen closely for organ swirls,
    stolid guitar, a backwards ""Barbara Ann"" allusion, and my vast oceans
    of digital melancholy.</p><p>
    
    Joking aside, second track and newest single ""Play the Hits"" is the
    one you want. Knob-twiddler Edwyn Collins (get well soon) sets
    vocalist modules ""Dave Allen"" and ""Paul Allen"" to Four Season
    falsetto, injecting a catchy Motown beat, jittery Orange Juice bass
    line, and infallible castanets. ""Here she comes/ And I guess she's
    got a lot to talk about,"" the Allens sing before oohing appropriately.
    You'll find finale ""Coming Right Over"" memorable for its similarities
    to the Supremes' recording of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", an
    update with this version.</p><p>
    
    You see, the 2005 series is the most reliable classic-rock computer
    ever made. It builds on the similarly somber, canon-affirming tones of
    such previous models as Travis (that's the ""Sing"" banjo line on ""I Sat
    Down""), the Thrills (throughout), and tourmates the Delays and
    Starsailor. I hesitate to mention Ocean Colour Scene. Looking forward

    before ever playing a gig outside the Northeastern U.S., they must 
    be 
    doing something right. Right? Well, in Dr. Dog's case, it seems more 
    like they have a superfriend in <i>Times</i> music critic Kelefa Sanneh. He 
    describes the group's modestly sized fan base as ""rabid."" The way 
    Sanneh goes on about Dr. Dog in his December 2004 article, it sounds 
    like he might need to be put down. He paints the group's live sets, 
    filled with ""off-kilter ballads and light-headed riff-rock,"" as these 
    incendiary experiences that inspire converts to follow the group from 
    gig to gig, basking in musical glory that the greater world will soon 
    wear all over its face. Maybe there is a transcendent moment to be had 
    with this group in a live setting, with the beer and the dancing and 
    the 
    cramped quarters and the tinnitus-triggering volume. Or maybe you need 
    to get your drink on to stomach this stuff.</p><p>
    
    The fact that <i>Easy Beat</i> contains a lot of the ramshackle hallmarks 
    that can turn a live performance from charming to annoying-- interband whooping and hollering, sloppy playing, players really 
    feeling 
    moments that the crowd's not feeling, etc.-- does the group no favors. 
    And then there's the matter of the good Dr. working through a 
    predominant and stultifying influence. On this record, moments abound 
    that call to mind one of the crappiest made-up adjectives to be found 
    in 
    popular music writing-- ""Beatlesesque"". Whipping out that bon mot in a 
    piece of writing is akin to mailing it in, since the Beatles' presence 
    is pervasive (and widely acknowledged) throughout pop music. Liberal 
    employment of this term in the service of describing bands that don't 
    actually sound like the Beatles adds to the word's burgeoning 
    obsolescence.</p><p>
    
    That said, if there's any group worthy of shouldering this questionable 
    descriptor, then let it be these cats. It starts with the limbo-low 
    fidelity, which sounds like the work of George Martin if he was forced 
    to record with the Moutain Goats' ghetto blaster. Then you can play 
    ""Name That Tune!"" That silly walking bassline in ""The World May Never 
    Know""? ""Ob La Di, Ob La Da""! The string section break in ""Oh No""? 
    ""Eleanor Rigby""! The shout-along coda in ""Wake Up""? ""Hey Jude""! 
    The 
    sleepy torpor of ""Dutchman Falls""? ""I'm So Tired""! (The tuba is a 
    nice 
    touch, though.) And how about that unhinged flip-flopping between 
    over-amped organ blooz and the twee song bits? Hey, it's time for the 
    <i>Abbey Road</i> medley!</p><p>
    
    Instances like 
    those 
    are like the moments in a movie where suspension of disbelief is 
    dispelled-- they take you out of the moment and ruin the experience. 
    No doubt better production (something possibly outside the group's 
    purview right now) or stronger songwriting (something the group can better control) would hide these things, but on <i>Easy Beat</i>, they're front and 
    center like mondo-sized zits. Next time, more bits like the spry first 
    third of ""Oh No"" and the rave-up in ""Say Something"", please. Save the 
    guitar weeping and the Ringo drumming for the tribute shows. And if 
    you, dear reader, happen to find yourself at a bar or club amidst this 
    hirsute group and their whirling dervish fans, give them a wide berth 
    and order another round.</p></div>"|2608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2608-easy-beat/|4.4|David Raposa

It's a phonetic transliteration of the French ""Te qui toi?""-- ""Who Are You?""-- and though Taha spends a couple of songs on the record asking questions, he spends a lot more of it in the imperative. There are more exclamation points in the trilingual transcriptions of the lyrics than a 15-year-old girl's yearbook, and you couldn't call the music anything but urgent. Even when he is asking questions, as on the opening title track, he's spitting them out in a gritty, pungent attack, though it's worth noting that part of his guttural approach comes from the fact that he's a native Arabic speaker, as it's a very guttural language with lots of action in the back of the throat.</p><p> 
    Taha's politics and his music are the same thing, reflecting his multinational/nationless background, a story that began in Oran, Algeria and moved on to France when he was 10 years old. Taha has spoken in interviews of being a ""permanent immigrant,"" French and yet Algerian, a part of both cultures and yet not quite integrated with either. His music reflects both identities in its embrace of Western styles like punk, house, and electro, viewed through the prism of Algerian rai. The union makes perfect sense-- rai is both Algeria's punk music and its signature dance music. It's the kind of stuff that proves the limitations and biases of a term like World music; this is where Taha's records are inevitably filed, owing to...what? The Egyptian strings that wind their way through most of the songs, perhaps? Because he sings in French and Arabic and occasionally in Berber? Honestly, it's sad that our marketplace can't just accept it on its own terms and recognize the global pop music world for the continuum that it is.</p><p> 
    For <em>Tékitoi</em>, Taha and longtime producer Steve Hillage have captured a massive sound stuffed with crunching guitars, swirling strings and colossal beats that's guaranteed to go over well with anyone who liked his past work North African percussion and a guitar-like instrument called a mandolute also feature prominently in the mix amongst the programming and distortion, giving the music a layered, expansive texture that freely mixes the organic with the artificial. The mandolute has an awesome timbre, dry like the desert that bore it, with a loose-stringed edge similar to an oud.</p><p>  
    When the world is your sonic playground, you're bound to come up with some interesting stuff, and Taha doesn't disappoint. ""H'Asbu-Hum (Ask Them for an Explanation)"" finds hints of French musette rising up through the bumping Algerian beats, the Brian Eno collaboration ""Dima (Always)"" is full of skitterign drum programing and aslow, darkly luxurious string arrangement, and ""Meftuh (Open)"" splits open a conservative rai arrangement with slamming drums and blasting electric guitar. ""My heart and yours are wounded/ the doors to prosperity are still open!"" he shouts in Arabic on ""Meftuh,"" mixing hope for the future with a curt acknowledgment that the past is full of pain and wrong.</p><p> 
    As great as most of the songs are, though, there's an elephant in the tracklist that's impossible to ignore. It's called ""Rock el Casbah,"" and it's a very faithful cover of the Clash's ""Rock the Casbah,"" with the verses translated into Arabic and Egyptian strings fluttering in the wings. If that were the whole story, it'd be an interesting cover and little else, but Taha's history adds another layer, namely that his original band, a France-based punk group called Carte de Sejour that incorporated elements of rai into its sound was concurrent with the Clash and may have actually been the inspiration for the original ""Rock the Casbah"". Taha himself passed the Clash a tape of Carte de Sejour while they were touring France, and less than a year later found himself listening to a very familiar sound coming from the radio in the form of ""Rock the Casbah"". It's possible to view ""Rock el Casbah"" as a reclamation as much as a cover, and listening back, it's quite striking how well-suited Joe Strummer's odd, throaty voice actually would have been to rai.</p><p> 
    Early pressings of <em>Tékitoi</em> include a DVD featuring a 43-minute documentary called <i>Kienes</i> (it does the same for Spanish that the album title does for French) that rather loosely chronicles Taha's tour of Mexico, where he and his band play everywhere from what looks like a small-town fair to a posh theater where the audience looks ridiculous sitting down for such intensely kinetic music. It's actually better for the interview clips than the live clips, though, as Taha plays with journalists, asking them to define their lazy terminology (the scene where he asks a reporter to define the Third World is especially telling) and explaining that he's really a contemporary of the Clash and not a follower. For its part, the album scarcely needs any extras to make it worthwhile, and it's a perfect exemplar of pop's progressive globalism, bashing down barriers that governments have barely begun to tackle.</p></div>"|8287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8287-tekitoi/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Here adoringly re-mastered and issued for the first time on CD, the album succinctly captures the band's embryonic but already utterly distinctive blend of ad-hoc country, folk, jazz and home-schooled art-rock. And though this reissue will almost certainly prove most valuable to established fans of the band, newcomers with an ear for indie history should also relish the opportunity for a glimpse at the early workings of this seminal act.</p><p>
    
    One of the true seed groups of Chicago's late 80s-early 90s resurgence, Shrimp Boat featured the nascent talents of future The Sea &amp; Cake members Sam Prekop and Eric Claridge, and <em>Speckly</em> was recorded with assistance from Brad Wood and Brian Deck, who would go on to work with the likes of Liz Phair, Red Red Meat, and Tortoise. Along with multi-instrumentalists David Kroll and Ian Schneller, the group forged their unique sound during a time when the American indie landscape was largely dominated by shaggy proto-grunge and noisy art-damaged post-hardcore acts, lending the group's early work a singular, out-of-time air.</p><p>
    
    Since Shrimp Boat's mongrel sound, spry arrangements and loose, flown-by-seat-of-pants instrumentation never truly seemed fixed to any specific date or scene, <em>Speckly</em> has aged particularly well, and in fact these still-fresh tracks could easily be confused for something recorded last week, last year, or 1975. Songs like the opening ""Planter's Song"" and the banjo-fed ""Hyatt Ridge Circle Dance"" carry themselves jauntily along on rustic, harvest-time rhythms, while such rambunctious numbers as ""Lemming's Leap"" and ""Green Island"" stagger beneath woozy, discordant blasts of saxophone and trumpet-- the musicians never too proud to pick up an instrument they were unschooled to play.</p><p>
    
    Other highlights include a faithful spin through the traditional ""Shady Grove,"" a track that audibly foreshadows early Palace Brothers, and the jangly ""Melon Song"" which finds the duel guitars of Prekop and Schneller weaving nimbly around the melody with their Jerry Garcia-like arabesque flourishes. Unfortunately the group's raggedy, unvarnished vocals pose a liability throughout the album, especially on tracks like the yowling ""Seven Crows"" where the guys sing as if they intend their lyrics physical harm.</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, when Shrimp Boat manages to bring their many streams into confluence, if only for a few brief moments, as on the majestic ""Houston Tower,"" one can almost make out the skyline of Slanted and Enchanted shimmering mirage-like in the distance. With the bulk of the group's discography-- including their two subsequent albums Duende and Cavale-- currently out of print domestically, Aum Fidelity's restoration campaign couldn't have come at a better time, and hopefully this reappearance of <em>Speckly</em>  will allow newfound Shrimp Boat devotees a chance to appropriately start over at the beginning.</p></div>"|7771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7771-speckly/|7.0|Matthew Murphy

If only all bands were so economical and thoughtful. Clean acoustic guitar tones skip spryly as frontman Dudley Colley sings, lulling you into a comfy, downy softness. He's going on about his favorite topic: self-doubt, and its destructive nature on his personal relations with the opposite sex. ""I wanted your eyes to oversee my graceless ways,"" he pleads. A triangle chimes in the background; it's all very bittersweet. But just when you think everything's about to wrap-up with a helpless Charlie Brown sigh, the Duds switch gears and plow right through the garage door.</p><p>
    
    Crusty guitars on loan from Mogwai crash in and, before you get a chance to see if your CD player has switched discs while you were sleeping, drummer Joss Mookens is treading a speedy double-bass while bassist Pip Moore (once again, real name) anchors the sudden high-flying rock'n'roll attack. The caper quickly concludes and, like a market-tested 30-second spot, this Corporation clues you in on the quick-cut, stop-start, loud-soft pattern that runs throughout much of <i>In Love With</i>, which was originally released in Europe last year. It's an appealing gambit at first but the anti-forumula-formula tires quickly, revealing the record's most trenchant moments to be the ones that groove instead of jerk.</p><p>
    
    ""To Angels and Dead Friends"" barely rises above a whisper but its Mozzy affectations soothes with hushed sincerity. ""Is my soul elegant enough?"" asks Colley, portraying a portrait of a beleaguered artist haunted by Catholic guilt in the face of young lust. ""Your skin tears at my nails/ Your skirt slips at my hands,"" he croons, ""As you open up to sin."" Brushstroke drums and a playful banjo enter as the singer offers a bit of sweet melodic cooing after rationalizing his actions with poetic poise: ""Angels and dead friends/ Crouching around our bed/ To look on and love with us."" With little fanfare, the intimate track click-clacks into the distance but its tender sentiment abides.</p><p>
    
    Too often though, Dudley's confessions lean on the side of whiney self-pity. ""I owe you, I owe you, I owe you/ Your downfall,"" he implores on ""Glance,"" which takes the group's rapid-fire whiplash tactics to their logical extreme. The punky minute-and-a-half whirlwind ""Blessed Are the Strong"" is mired in banal office-drone banter like, ""Half my life's been lost forever/ Pleasing evil awful people."" Statements like these ring hollow amid the pummeling blasts of upbeat, technically-proficient yet swaggerless instrumentation.</p><p>
    
    Initially coming off as part Yorkeian wail, part Malkmus shrug, Colley's delivery ultimately lacks both the haunting reaches of the former and the endearing quirks of the latter. Still, when loosely tempered, this Corporation can pull off the heart-tugging-on-sleeve indie rock thing with aplomb; between all the stop-on-a-dime showiness are simple songs looking for some breathing room.</p></div>"|2610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2610-in-love-with-the-dudley-corporation/|6.6|Ryan Dombal

    Dungen's debut sounds almost nothing like <i>Ta Det Lungt</i>, or that Gustav
    Ejstes' promising first works are so irredeemably flaky. These early
    songs, though containing the germ of psych-rock prodigy Ejstes'
    considerately structure-oriented future, are maddeningly unfocused.
    <i>1999-2001</i> contains three meandering compositions, each between 11
    and 18 minutes in length, that often hit upon captivating ideas,
    only to blow them quickly asunder. There's little coherence, and even
    less development-- just tease after tease of riffs sans refrain. Ejstes
    flirts with melodies before submerging them in murky Tangerine
    Dream-style ambience. Transitions? Who needs 'em.</p><p>
    Some may hear these descriptors and call to mind the Mars Volta's
    contentious <i>Frances the Mute</i> (which, I'm told, is the greatest album
    ever made), but there's a fundamental difference: <i>1999-2001</i> is music
    that's grandiose on premise but modest in execution. Approach the Mars
    Volta's hifalutin drift, meanwhile, with caution. Frances the Mute is
    like the dude who, thoroughly lubricated, shoulders his way into other
    peoples' conversations at a party: Loud, clumsy, longwinded, and
    probably uninvited. Tripping too hard to socialize, <i>1999-2001 stays
    back on the commune, dancing to the Rain God in solitude. Let it
    frolic about, but good luck finding its wavelength.</i></p><p>
    Oh, right, the music. Where to begin? Archaeologists are currently at
    work cataloguing the 6,487 individual passages on <i>1999-2001</i>. But in
    lieu of a much-needed road map, I can tell you that the album starts
    on a strong note. Well, ""Stadsvandringar"" doesn't so much start as it
    does enter, in the form of an opening guitar solo that wouldn't sound
    out of place round the three minute-mark of <i>Ta Det Lungt</i>'s ""Festival"".
    Ejstes' sinuous psych-fuzz guitar is soon overtaken by one of the
    record's few vocal melodies, which in turn is pushed aside by an
    analog synth burbling up from the deep. From there, the song sort of
    drifts. After
    ducking into a saucy bossa-jazz detour, Ejstes showcases his
    multi-instrumentalist talents by taking a drum solo, but a refrain
    cuts abruptly in-- what else?-- a gong smash.</p><p>
    ""Standsvandringar""-- as well as the album's other two tracks,
    ""Midsommarbongen"" and ""Lilla V\x8Annen""-- eventually finds its footing in
    the nether reaches of its inexhaustible runtime. ""Lilla V\x8Annen""
    actually features the echoey cogitative flute sampled on <i>Ta Det
    Lungt's ""Lejonet Och Kulan"". The riff lasts for a precious few
    seconds, but any glimmer of familiarity is welcome amid </i><i>1999-2001</i>'s
    overwhelming sprawl, and for that reason, I hereby declare ""Lilla
    V\x8Annen"" this collection's best track. (It also features a hyperkinetic
    outro that finally captures the galvanization we could've used from
    the outset.) Ejstes has helmed a working knowledge of an impressive
    array of instruments, and he wants you to know it. But his virtuosity
    is more as a songwriter than a musician. (Though who wouldn't mind
    hearing a few more of those roaring drum fills the likes of ""Panda""'s
    intro?) Come see the young genius' blue-hot juvenalia. Bring reading
    material.</p></div>"|2574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2574-1999-2001/|5.9|Sam Ubl

This may have been a rash decision. It's difficult to say what may have been in those books, but it can't be much worse than the confused tangle of inarticulate introspection, half-baked bravado, and anti-mainstream harangues that make up the bulk of the album. C-Rayz is one of the thousands of indie-rappers who routinely confuse ""expressionistic depth"" with ""not saying anything at all""; there must be a better way to convey post-millennial paranoia than a line like ""Inside the pain, my thoughts was in shambles/ My brain, like eggs, became scrambled."" And he uses the god-awful ""holding my dic [pause] tionary"" pun in two separate songs.</p><p>
    
    Walz came up as a battle rapper, but here he mostly goes on vague philosophical tangents. And when he does lash out, his disses often come across toothless (""You're a clown; you wanna be down and sound gritty/ Your life was inspired by <i>New Jack City</i>""). It doesn't help that his voice is mixed ridiculously high, so it never gets a chance to settle into the mix. And most of these beats are boring noodley sci-fi indie-rap joints with no bounce or flow. The best Def Jux albums (<i>The Cold Vein</i>, <i>I Phantom</i>) are fully realized, unified works, but the tracks on <i>Year of the Beast</i> don't have a damn thing to do with one another. There's no sweep or vision, and so Walz's worst flaws are left exposed: his tendency to lose the beat, his obnoxious habit of multi-tracking his own voice, the lack of force or immediacy in his jumpy, splenetic delivery.</p><p>
    
    It's a shame, since there's a much better album fighting to get out of <i>Year of the Beast</i>. On tracks like El-P's buzzing, broken apocalyptic banger ""Paradise"" and the heavy, burbling old-school dancehall throwback ""Pink"", Walz adjusts to the beat rather than forcing it to adjust to him. And Walz occasionally shows flashes of trenchant insight and eloquence. On the claustrophobic guitar-based stomper ""Blackout"", Walz is actually funny when he negotiates racial envy and confusion: ""I'ma be the shit at the meeting, statistically speaking."" If Walz had brought those strengths to the rest of the album, he might've had something. Maybe next time he should keep the Bic away from the rhyme books.</p></div>"|8787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8787-year-of-the-beast/|4.2|Tom Breihan

    the world's most grindingly slow soundscapes since forming as an Earth
    tribute band in 1998. Transcending the initial plan, Sunn O)))
    have birthed their own solar system across a number of mind-blowing
    albums. (And due largely to Sunn O)))'s championing and reintroduction
    of the earlier Seattle drone gods via
    an even darker approximation of their sound, Earth are having a bit of a revival
    with a live album recently out on TroubleMan, a remix album, and a new
    LP forthcoming on Southern Lord.)</p><p>
    
    The low-end of both twosomes has inspired overwrought reviews; considering Sunn O)))'s inky
    imagery, Julian Cope guest poems, shared songwriting credits from
    ex-Melvins/Earth and current Thrones/High on Fire maestro Joe Preston,
    and sundry Norwegian associates, it makes sense that weighty metaphors are chosen to peg the guitar swarm. For instance, Australian
    artist Seldon Hunt's ""miasmic visionary text,"" which ably accompanies
    the reissue of Sunn O)))'s long out-of-print <i>The GrimmRobe Demos</i>.
    Titled ""ODE To THE GRIMMRoBE"", the 10-page Maldororian text
    attempts to recreate the land o' Sunn O))) via free association. As
    might be expected from an artist who's created artwork for KK Null and Neurosis, Hunt goes to pleasing imagistic extremes.</p><p>
    
    Southern Lord
    returned the band's startlingly assured debut into print after discovering original copies on sale at
    eBay for upwards of $90. Recorded live in April 1998, <i>The GrimmRobe
    Demos</i> were first issues in an edition of 700 CDs by Hydra Head
    imprint. This new draft was re-mastered by John
    Wiese (Man Is The Bastard, Bastard Noise, Sissy Spacek) and
    includes an extra track, ""Grimm and Bear It"", which first appeared as a
    vinyl-only drone on the double-LP version of 2001's <i>Flight of the
    Behemoth</i>.</p><p>
    
    These recordings showcase Stephen O'Malley and Greg Anderson at their most purely distilled. No words are spoken. No
    samples. No guest poetry. Just heavy fucking sustained
    resonances. But not going it alone for this particular marathon,
    ex-Burning Witch player Stuart Dahlquist ends
    bass (though, really, everything's kinda bass). Despite guests, Sunn
    O))) proper remain the offspring of Anderson and O'Malley. Esteemed in the
    underground world of metal, their family tree couldn't be stronger.
    Both played in Thorr's Hammer and Burning Witch; O'Malley
    also moves like molasses in Khanate and the Lotus Eaters.
    Anderson, who runs Southern Lord records, is in Goatsnake.</p><p>
    
    So what exactly does this stuff sound like? The subtitle on the back
    of the CD helps: ""doom:power:ambient:drone:invokation"" At
    the band's Southern Lord home page, it's stated more verbosely: ""The SUNNO))) mission
    is to create trance like soundscapes with the ultimate low end/bottom
    frequencies intended to massage the listeners intestines into an act
    of defecation."" Now, pretend a
    Melvins' tune is made of taffy. Stretch it as far as it goes before
    it breaks. Think of Sleep's monumental <i>Jerusalem</i> leveled to a
    flat-line minus vocals or visible dynamics. Spin Keiji Haino until
    he's dizzy and then place with sunglasses painted black beneath a
    starless sky. Something equally slow, but with entirely different
    instrumentation is the exhilaratingly spare new album <i>Geisterfaust</i> by ""horror-jazz"" quartet Bohren &amp; Der Club
    of Gore.</p><p>
    
    Across ""Black Wedding"", ""Defeating: Earths' Gravity"", ""Dylan Carlson""
    (named for the main songwriter/guitarist in Earth), and the
    aforementioned ""Grimm and Bear It"" there are no guitar solos. Sunn 0))) is focused on the swarm of the sound
    scape. Fluctuations exist, but as with hardcore minimalism, you'll
    have to press yourself into the waves and feel around before pulling
    out the glistening viscera: ""Black Wedding"" uses more
    squiggly/oscillating electronics and ""Grimm and Bear It"" features a different resonance/texture and more
    mid-range.</p><p>
    
    It seems a good time to return to Sunn O)))'s formative sounds,
    especially as we await their newest and most ambitious effort, which includes guest spots
    by Leviathan and Xasthur's Malefic (vocals recorded inside coffins,
    which are inside hearses)-- as well as a cover of Immortal's
    ""Cursed Realms of the Winter Demons"". Recently playing live shows with Attila Csihar, Tos Neiwenhuizen, and
    Oren Ambarchi as part of the robe-and-hood crew, the band promises
    the new work will be their
    darkest and heaviest yet. I'm really not sure how these dudes can top
    what they've done thus far, but OK Sunn O))), bring it on.</p></div>"|7580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7580-the-grimmrobe-demos/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

    girlfriends, four fiancées, seven or eight grandparents, my more agile
    pets, and countless friends I've dragged to shows or made Deerhoof
    mixtapes for, thinking that 15 different live versions of ""Panda
    Panda Panda"" played in one sitting might actually convert them. Like
    jumping in front of moving cars apparently, or eating live snakes,
    people dig this sing-songy noise pop shit like the godhead it is, or
    they...don't.</p><p>
    Let's pass over Dave Moore's misguided <i>Bibidi Babidi Boo</i> rant
    (sorry D-Mo, Deerhoof songs always sound better live)-- last we left
    off I was excited how <i>Milk Man</i> traded up muscle mag flex for
    well-structured, utterly powerful atonal passages within the
    arrangements themselves. There were a few miscarriages-- ""Giga Dance""
    and ""Rainbow Silhouette"" and ""Song Of Sorn"" all felt like collections
    of isolated ideas forced together-- but the band gave us ""Milk Man""
    and ""Desaparecere"" and (again) ""C"", their three most ambitious songs
    and possibly their best. Deerhoof being Deerhoof, I thought it unfair
    to name Song Town their next frontier, but I did like what these
    songs' existence did for their live show. Shorter, noisier
    total-energy numbers made for massively interesting glue twixt the
    band's bigger anthems-- way better than tuning breaks or tight jean
    banter about how fucked everything is.</p><p>
    EPs being EPs, <i>Green Cosmos</i> makes no conclusions, instead
    collecting more and better evidence of Deerhoof's keen sense of
    obscured melody and self-pressure to keep every moment surprising. As
    part of some trans-Pacific reception experiment (the band talks a
    little about that <a href=""http://pitchforkmedia.com/interviews/d/deerhoof-05/""><u>here</u></a> and <a href=""http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/0515/050413_music_smallmouth.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>there</u></a>), Satomi sings most lyrics in her
    native Japanese; Greg et al. couple that twist with the band's most
    orchestral-sounding arrangements to date. Micro-symphonic,
    micro-symphonies. The record's short-- seven songs, fifteen minutes--
    so we do miss out on that steady-gaining riff hurricane thing
    <i>Reveille</i> and <i>Apple O'</i> pull off. But hey, as six
    brilliant pieces (four new) in the increasingly robust Deerhoof
    repertoire (one song's eh), <i>Green Cosmos</i> boasts sheer utility,
    making not so much its own statement but simply letting the band
    restate itself.</p><p>
    Old seven-inch/live staple ""Come See The Duck"", here shortened,
    electrified and reimagined, remains Noisy Deerhoof's best summation:
    candy vox mels, hot licks in tandem, viciously unpredictable rhythms.
    Here ""Duck"" finds chum in cartoon scorcher ""Hot Mint Air Balloon""
    (""mint air"" a reference to the EP title, itself a reference to what
    scientists believe to be the combined color of the visible universe)
    and ""Byun"", re-recorded for keyboards, more contrast, and
    unprecedented autism-- a high compliment.</p><p>
    Understandably, everyone's gonna wanna talk about the title track, its
    Latin percussion and church organ breaks-- could-be-kitschy stuff that
    works because the melody's so rotten-good and the breakdown's
    breathtaking, unlike the chintzy magic carpet misfire ""Spiral Gold
    Town"". But the ballads, holy shit. Deerhoof tried writing these things
    before-- ""Littleness"", ""Days &amp; Nights..."", ""Apple Bomb, and ""Satan""
    came close-- but without fanfare the band came off a bit ghostly. Or
    maybe Satomi's just more confident now. In any case, ""Malalauma"" pits
    her against a tangle of guitar discord that threatens
    never to resolve, each side more menacing when contrasted so
    violently. And if ""Duck"" flagships Noisy Deerhoof, new song ""Koneko""
    (Japanese for ""kitten"") does a fair job summing up Song Deerhoof (not
    to over-articulate a distinction, but you know). Backing Satomi's calm
    delivery, troubled guitar intervals slowly move to a resolution, and
    at the very last second, everything falls apart. In place, Deerhoof
    give us one wholly awful mess-- the song's clubbed foot that,
    for some of us, is quite endearing.</p></div>"|2255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2255-green-cosmos-ep/|7.9|Nick Sylvester

    about
    the increasing complexity of so-called base pop culture-- the content's
    smut
    but the plots have thickened and the demands on the audience have
    multiplied. Television, blockbuster films, and video games get the inches,
    but I'm
    wondering to what extent the same ideas might apply to pop music. This
    Jane
    release for instance-- if we take it for after-party or ambient (why
    not?)--
    awfully busy next to Eno records with the same wallpaper intent. Past
    that,
    so many of us can read and work etc., while listening to stuff that's
    kicking
    and screaming for our attention. Maybe we just need something buzzing
    in the
    background to keep us pinched, but all that's to say: Even our most passive
    listening experiences-- willed or de facto-- have grown more demanding.</p><p>
    
    (Pretty good, right?)</p><p>
    
    Jane began as an informal collaboration between Noah Lennox (Animal
    Collective's Panda Bear) and Scott Mou (DJ Casio, aka Other
    Music's
    tall, long-haired Asian guy who, I think, has heard every record ever
    made)
    laying down skinny beats and drones. They released two CD-Rs in-store
    (I've
    only heard the one nicked <i>Paradise</i>), and for <i>Berserker</i>
    they
    seem to have picked, packaged, and remastered the passages most apropos
    to
    its unspoken <i>Young Prayer</i>-Plus demeanor. That
    record,
    we'll say, demanded too much from me, so I always felt Mou's gorgeous
    textures and sense of build played good foil-- Lennox lets loose, but
    Mou's
    patient grooves and pink noise always cushion his fall. Yeah, these
    tracks
    are jammy or whatever, but I'd much rather that than fucking ""Waltz For
    Koop""-- the moments worth paying attention to here are, in fact,
    transfixing.</p><p>
<i>Berserker</i>'s title track and the ""AGG Report"" schaffel are Jane par
    (by
    now the triply-released ""Berserker"" must be their theme song), but
    ""Shipping
    Away"" is why the duo are more than an Animal Collective footnote.
    The
    song starts primordial, slowly climbing out its cocoon, conscious of its
    own
    beat-woozy evolution until Mou's death comet breaks suffocate Lennox,
    and
    the two spend the last three minutes destroying all the evidence. The
    next
    track, ""Swan"", is 24 minutes of bonus organ drones and echo box-- about
    as
    much time as we need to unwind after ""Shipping Away""-- if we, like,
    listened.</p><p>
    
    I hinted above Jane have recorded other stuff that just wouldn't have
    fit
    <i>Berserker</i>'s wind-down post-party vibe. One track on
    <i>Paradise</i>
    is, no joke, a 21-minute microgoth masterpiece. Paw Tracks' website
    suggests
    there's some <i>Panda Bear Dances</i> 12"" on the way, so maybe
    that's it.
    In any case, this Lennox-Mou collaboration has a lot more potential than
    <i>Berserker</i> leads on-- pay attention?</p></div>"|4357.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4357-berserker/|7.8|Nick Sylvester

Credit's due for making that seem like the natural way to go. Most bands this stylish would follow a record like <i>The Power Out</i> with more time at home, working up pop singles and plotting for buzz. These four, though: They stay as <i>The Wire</i>-friendly as they are photogenic. They head straight back to Steve Albini's Chicago studio and spend a couple months patiently developing the corners of their sound.</p><p>
    Which gives us <i>Axes</i>: Thirteen largely instrumental tracks that see these women plowing happily into the groove. The routine's as simple and chic as always, starting slow and then building up into a race. But where their elegant melodies once had people comparing them to Stereolab, Albini's band-in-a-room production exposes more affinity with the Krautrock that fueled Stereolab in the first place. Figure in Electrelane's rock-band grounding, and the usual clich gets reversed: This is like Neu! <i>not</i> on acid-- a concrete, de-psychedelicized, unfuturistic indie drone.</p><p>
    When it works, it's because of all those quirks pushing in at the edges of the band's sound-- quirks this album is all about exploring. There's the mall-lobby piano that cropped up on <i>The Power Out</i>, which emerges here as an even stronger component. Same goes for the Chicago A Cappella Choir, who pop up at the end of ""Suitcase"" for one of the album's most impressive arrangements. And lo, unfuturism: Best of all is Verity Susman's ongoing Old Europe fixation, the same one that had her nicking lyrics from sixteenth-century Spanish poets and the band doing one photo shoot looking like Rosicrucian falconers. ""Eight Steps"" goes from Parisian harmonium rag to German piano sonata and back, and some form of European-history rock seems to have been born.</p><p>
    So it starts well. Susman sings her way through two singles as sharp as anything from last year, and the grooves they dig into immediately afterward are just as captivating, in texture and composition both. It's only in the center that some old doubts emerge. This band, after all, is likeable, ""credible,"" and sonically stylish, and when too many tracks build to their inevitable rave-ups, it's easy to start wondering if sometimes that's all that's on offer: It fills in the air and it certainly <i>sounds</i> right, but how much is actually happening in there? There are certain lines between making this stuff sing and just jamming through it for practice, and said lines do get rather trod upon. </p><p>
    After a lull like that, it's a credit to the record's final quarter that it can win you back, with banjo and horn figures on ""Come Back"" sounding almost like the Books, and choir and organ raving their way beautifully out through the closer. Electrelane-as-pop fans may miss Susman's voice when she hops behind the piano or the harmonium and puts time in on arranging the album's textures. But that elegant instrumental pulse is as uniquely theirs as it ever was, and credit's due for doing exactly what we always say bands like this <i>should</i> be doing: Putting their heads down and patiently developing their most original ideas. The results might be a little thin on actual ""essential"" moments, but they're working in the right direction.</p></div>"|2724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2724-axes/|7.3|Nitsuh Abebe

The song jumped and wriggled and moved like nothing else on the radio: a huge, loose-limbed, roiling, sweaty, berserk drum break, greasy guitars stabs exploding like fireworks. Rich Harrison, who produced Beyonce's ""Crazy in Love"", made the track, and it has the same sense of dizzy sunkissed freedom. But its greatest asset is the voice that cut through the drums like a sword, yelping and gasping and screaming for joy.</p><p>
    
    ""1 Thing"" is the first track on R&amp;B; singer Amerie Rogers' sophomore album <i>Touch</i>, and the album never again reaches the giddy heights of that song. It never could. ""1 Thing"" is all sweat and teeth and adrenaline. After that opening salvo, Rogers slowly settles into the pillowy, luxurious tracks that Harrison creates for her. Harrison's production has an organic core. He spent his formative years working in D.C. go-go, and his compositions have that loose-limbed swagger, relying heavily on sampled horn screams and weeping electric pianos. But his work never sounds like a throwback; his tracks all have a glossy, processed sheen.</p><p>
    
    Amerie may be the perfect collaborator for Harrison's combination of Stax grit and Neptunes shine. Rogers has one of those thin, reedy voices popular on the radio right now; another producer would probably turn her into a sound effect, the way Lil Jon did with Ciara on ""Goodies"". But she has an urbane sophistication that sets her apart from the likes of Ashanti and Nivea; her precise jazz phrasing is the only saving grace on the mawkish ballad ""Just Like Me"". And when she has to, she brings out a fiery emotional center; on the breakup stomper ""Rolling Down My Face"", she squeezes across the song's tricky mix of regret and determination. Midway through the album, Rogers and Harrison come together perfectly for the second time on ""Talkin' About"", an impossibly catchy midtempo howler with a shifty drum track and the sort of glorious chorus hook that'll worm its way right into your brain. These two know each other well.</p><p>
    
    Harrison produced eight of the 13 tracks on <i>Touch</i>, and too many of the other producers' tracks don't fit into his lush tapestry. Rogers can't do anything with Bryce Wilson's squelchy Neptunes keyboards on ""Not the Only One"". But Rogers brings her personality to tracks that wouldn't have worked otherwise. When Lil Jon shows up for the obligatory club track (the title track here), Rogers' frisky, coy vocal and a nimble little conga bit turn an otherwise leaden, paint-by-numbers crunk&amp;b; track into a sexy little experiment with Latin freestyle. It may not be ""1 Thing"", but it'll do.</p></div>"|458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/458-touch/|7.6|Tom Breihan

The band has now released more LPs this decade than current indie staples like the Shins, New Pornographers, and Strokes, so can we please drop the ""Welcome back!"" fanfare. Fortunately, <em>Oceans Apart</em> doesn't need the same apologetic disclaimer tagged onto 2000's <i>The Friends of Rachel Worth</i> and 2003's <em>Bright Yellow Bright Orange</em>. Frontmen Robert Forster and Grant McLennan probably needed those two lackluster works to shake off 11 years worth of rust, but with <em>Oceans Apart</em>, Forster and McLennan regain their songwriting momentum. Forster redeems himself right from the start-- opener ""Here Comes a City"" is a jerky post-punk rocker highlighted by a jangly Middle Eastern riff. It packs more confidence and intensity in its first 10 seconds than all of <em>Bright Yellow Bright Orange</em>'s hoary folk balladry.</p><p>
    
    Of course, some credit's also due to longtime Go-Betweens producer Mark Wallis, whose presence on <em>Oceans Apart</em> also signifies a return to the stripped-down, lush atmospheres found on the Go-Betweens' landmark late-80s albums <i>Tallulah</i> and <i>16 Lovers Lane</i>. Gone are the masturbatory Coldplay-sized string arrangements that plagued the previous two albums; in are supporting keyboards and intricately layered guitar parts. Songs like McLennan's somber ""Finding You"" benefit the most from Wallis's tinkering: Instead of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Forster's stark electric lead and McLennan's delicate ""ah's"" comprise the song's climactic bridge.</p><p>
    
    As expected, Forster and McLennan fill every musical nook and cranny with delectable pop melodies, yet even Wallis's production wizardry can't revive the same enthusiasm and emotional allure in their voices that made subtle songs like ""Bachelor Kisses"" and ""Part Company"" such indelible classics. Yet as awkward as they sometimes sound, the Go-Betweens are still writing consistently gorgeous pop songs, and <em>Oceans Apart</em> proves they aren't content simply pleasing their most die-hard fans; they're back to making albums that, in a better world, appeal to everyone.</p></div>"|3479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3479-oceans-apart/|7.0|Adam Moerder

After a disappointing major-label debut-- 1998's <i>Let's Kill Saturday Night</i>-- he rebounded to Bloodshot with <i>Couples in Trouble, </i><i>The Best of Robbie Fulks</i>, and <i>13 Hillbilly Giants</i>, and now is releasing his sixth album, <i>Georgia Hard</i>, on which he finally and fully indulges his obsession with the 1970s countrypolitan sophistication of Roger Miller and Don Williams.</p><p>
    
    The problem with Fulks' fidelity, however, is simple: He doesn't have the voice for this kind of country music. It's too thin and textureless, with a nerdy nasalness that lacks the coarse grain of hard experience that marks so many of his idols. On <i>Georgia Hard</i>, he fares best on straightforward songs like ""Where There's a Road"" and ""It's Always Raining Somewhere""-- both of which start the album on a deceptively strong note. But Fulks just can't sell the hard emotions of the country noir ""Coldwater, Tennessee"" or ballads like ""I Never Did Like Planes"" or ""If They Could Only See Me Now"". He attempts to compensate by emulating everyone from Charlie Rich and George Jones to Faron Young and even Jimmy Buffett (on ""I Never Did like Planes""), but it sounds like mimicry and, over the course of 15 songs, feels a little disjointed.</p><p>
    
    As a result, despite some admittedly well-crafted tunes, there doesn't seem to be much of a personality directing these songs. Such emptiness, however, is better than the threat of irony: Occasionally Fulks' vocals sound as though they are delivered with a knowing wink, as if he's satirizing the genre from the inside. Obviously, Fulks is sincere in his love of country music (a genre that prizes earnestness and disavows ambiguity), but it doesn't help that he seems more invested in jokey songs like ""I'm Gonna Take You Home (And Make You Like Me)"" (a duet with his wife, Donna) and ""Countrier Than Thou"", both of which prove no more subversive than your typical Ray Stevens song. And he's clearly enamored with the flushed-from-the-bathroom-of-your-heart strain of country-music wordplay. But his old-hat puns-- like ""All You Can Cheat"", ""Doin' Right (for All the Wrong Reasons)"", and ""Goodbye Cruel Girl""-- are long past threadbare.</p><p>
    
    As with so many recent anti-mainstream country albums, <i>Georgia Hard</i> sounds less clever and risky compared to what has come out of Nashville over the past year. Big &amp; Rich's <i>Horse of a Different Color</i> is much more imaginative and playful, and albums by Gretchen Wilson, Julie Roberts, and Dierks Bentley sound more soulful and innovative even as they draw on older styles. Does this Nashville resurgence signal an end to insurgent country? Is now the time for all those artists who've been out in the alt- wildernesss to reconcile with Music Row? Fulks in particular might have some radio hits in him, if only he'll let someone else sing them.</p></div>"|3340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3340-georgia-hard/|4.1|Stephen M. Deusner

Death,
    its inexorability, and our fear of it render us as helpless as when we were
    toddlers. Many of us fill the resulting tremulous mental gap with
    religion (""our Father...""); others with work, love, or grown-up
    childishness like golf; and you and I, perhaps, with pop music. Cloud
    Cult bandleader Craig Minowa is obsessed with this space-- with
    infancy, mortality, and, alas, infant mortality-- and his grandiose
    fourth album, <em>Advice from the Happy Hippopotamus</em>, occupies it
    with messy, expansive, computer-ok indie rock.</p><p>
    I'm often captivated by bands that find quirky beauty in modest
    everyday moments. Cloud Cult do this, too, particularly on last year's
    <em>Aurora Borealis</em>, but here they more often aim for lofty
    apotheosis: for <em>The Moon and Antarctica</em>, <em>Odelay</em>, or the
    Radiohead masterpiece of your choice. <em>Advice from the Happy
    Hippopotamus</em> is utterly over the top, starting with its title and
    ridiculous cover art (see also: the name ""Cloud Cult""), and those hard
    souls who don't like it will find it easy to mock. The rest of us will
    find our crusty, professionally cynical veneers crumbling. Over an
    intimidatingly vast 25 tracks melding folk, electronics, Arcade Fire
    emo, and quasi-hippie hoobajoo, Cloud Cult gird their ambition with
    solid tunes.</p><p>
    It's tempting to call Minowa, an organic farmer from the Minnesota
    wilds, a kind of insane genius. His voice is equal parts Isaac Brock
    yelp and Conor Oberst quaver, his CDs made of recycled materials, his
    home studio geothermally powered. He has the perverse confidence to
    open <em>Advice</em> with a wordless industrial freakout and bury the
    album's most accessible song, plaintive acoustic ballad ""Bobby's
    Spacesuit"", as a hidden track. Title track ""Happy Hippo""
    buzzes like the Chemical Brothers, twinkles like a fairytale and boinks
    like a video game before recklessly pilfering from Neil Young's ""Hey
    Hey, My My""-- also, it's about a hippopotamus. (""She lives under my
    matt-uh-russ."")</p><p>
    The album's sprawl is dizzying: Crystalline Sunny Day Real Estate
    guitar lines on ""What Comes at the End"", jaunty banjo'n'beats for
    ""Lucky Today"", a Books-like spoken-word near-death-experience on ""The
    Light at the End of the Tunnel"", the tearjerker chamber-pop of
    ""Transistor Radio"", the dreamlike call and response of ""That Man
    Jumped Out the Window"" (replete with dead-on Thom Yorke histrionics on
    the lyric ""There's a fine line between falling and flying""). Like
    Young's <em>Harvest</em> and <em>Tonight's the Night</em>, <em>Advice</em>
    also includes a live track, cathartic post-votum depression rocker
    ""Moving to Canada"", which is a fitting successor to screeds like
    ""Divide and Conquer"" by fellow Minnesotans Hüsker Dü. There's also one
    song, ""Car Crash"", with a female lead vocal, delivered somberly by
    Mara Stemm. The warm Four Tet programming of such tracks as ""Washed
    Your Car"" scatters Oberst's <em>Digital Ash</em> like so much cigarette
    ash (burn!).</p><p>
    Flesh is a recurring theme. Does the human essence persist after its
    shell breaks down? This question is particularly compelling for
    Minowa, whose infant son died of unexplained causes in 2002, and whose
    spirit pervades this record. ""My skin is still me, with memories,""
    Minowa sings on ""Start New"", but ""Living on the Outside of Your Skin""
    attempts to break those surly bonds with toy piano and a growling
    guitar solo. ""What Comes at the End"" ponders reunion, reincarnation
    and ""fall[ing] in love in our new skin."" The elaborately
    off-the-cuff ""You Got Your Bones to Make a Beat"" celebrates existence
    with the unaffected joy of a dancing toddler.</p><p>
    Like a little boy or a crazed genius, Minowa isn't afraid to look
    silly as he follows his muse into a bizarrely fascinating fantasy
    world. One track, ""What It Feels Like to Be Alive"", consists of Minowa
    hokily exhorting a concert audience to ""show the people of the world that you are
    alive"". Amid the ensuing communal yawp is one unconverted smartass--
    a cipher, if you will, for a music scene fraught with carefully
    cultivated, ultimately unrevealing, laughably insecure projections of
    ""cool""-- who yells back, ""I'm dead!"" Don't be that guy.</p></div>"|1808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1808-advice-from-the-happy-hippopotamus/|8.3|Marc Hogan

    first, and those who spent their allowance on leather and had nothing
    left for records. If Maxïmo Park fall into the latter category, they
    do a good job of hiding it. <i>A Certain Trigger</i>, the band's debut
    full-length, is rife with enough peripatetic song structures and lithe
    arpeggios to convince substance-questioning naysayers of the Newcastle
    quintet's musical smarts. But, to an extent, yes, they're
    bandwagon-riders, and latecomers at that. The New Wave revival has
    already dined out on the charts. That's why, working with the scraps
    of a restless trend-seeking audience, Maxïmo Park's recent success in
    their homeland is so surprising.</p><p>
    Rather than turning up pebbles for the next Big Thing or exploiting a
    quirk, Maxïmo Park hone in on the specifics of an umbrella genre. Like
    the Futureheads or Postcard, they play jaunty, precise power pop with
    punk's antipathies, exuding a tentative cool. Managing (mostly) without
    fashonista caginess and attendant snark, Maxïmo Park are an easy sell.
    Occasionally, there's the requisite sneer at an ex or a
    self-deprecating barb, but <i>A Certain Trigger</i> is seldom anything short
    of gentlemanly.</p><p>
    That civility translates to a sort of sneakiness. Maxïmo Park's muted
    dynamics, understated vocals, and starchy production stack up to a
    weak first impression. But over the course of a slow'n'steady
    courtship, the album develops character. The tug comes partly from
    deceptively complicated song structures. Maxïmo Park dispense with
    traditional verse/chorus/verse formatting while the melodies,
    insouciantly catchy, play dumb. Songs slide from verse to pre-chorus
    to chorus to bridge to post-bridge with little fanfare. You're lucky
    to get a repeat, but who needs one when the band whip out with
    one-time, eight-bar dalliances like the ecstatic, whirling bridge on
    upwardly mobile single ""Graffiti""?</p><p>
    ""Apply Some Pressure"", the album's lead single, is typically
    roundabout. The song twists through some punchy, stiffly syncopated
    verses, each capped by a unison fill, before slipping into an extended
    bridge, driven by the type of harmony most bands would have been
    content to ride for an entire song. ""Going Missing"", with its
    propulsive beat and manic mood swings, is an overstuffed suitcase of
    post-breakup ambivalence: Lead singer Paul Smith is resilient while
    awake (""I'm going missing for awhile/ I've got nothing left to
    lose""), mournful in repose (""I sleep with my hands across my chest/
    And I dream of you with someone else""). Aforementioned ""Graffiti"",
    which features a wiry, Voidoids-style non-groove, is aberrantly
    loose-limbed, but the architecture is anything but perfunctory,
    sprouting little detours at every intersection.</p><p>
    The band's lack of swagger is refreshing amid the hot
    fussed-over convicts and misogynistic sun kings of the New Wave sphere, but
    it also hampers the less convincing tracks (i.e., ""Once a Glimpse"" and
    ""The Coast Is Always Changing""). There's also the question of why Maxïmo Park, a pop band, are on Warp,
    home to electronic visionaries Squarepusher and Autechre. The only
    reason I can think of is ""Acrobat"", an amazingly tender, drone-seeped
    song that harkens back to shoegaze and Velvet Underground while
    embracing modern gadgetry. It's Maxïmo Park's ""Maps"", a song at once
    exemplary of and antithetical to its brethren.</p><p>
    Don't take the comparisons as caveats. Maxïmo Park don't use their
    forebears as stepping stones out of creative desperation; it's a mark
    of their business savvy. Even if you know what's hot, you still have
    to make it pop, and nearly every song on <i>A Certain Trigger</i> succeeds.
    Maxïmo Park leave their grubby prints on each track, be it the
    teeth-grinding squall riding atop ""Signal &amp; Sign""'s second verse or
    the synths and organs lurking merrily underneath every song like a
    loner kid who snuck in to the dance party.</p></div>"|5646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5646-a-certain-trigger/|8.4|Sam Ubl

There's no way to know if records by Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom would sound any different had Bunyan never recorded <em>Just Another Diamond Day</em> in 1970, but songs from her lone album certainly sound fantastic sandwiched between cuts from <i>Nino Rojo</i> and <i>The Milk-Eyed Mender</i>. The record's spare production helps keep it from dating, but what really works today is Bunyan's soft, fragile Peter Pan voice. I imagine her understated whisper sounded out of step in its own time but now it sounds like a founding document of a certain school of indie singing.</p><p>
    
    Bunyan's return to music after three decades away has been a gradual stroll back to the center stage. Guesting on records from Piano Magic and Devendra Banhart, she hooked up with Animal Collective while they were in London last year to sing lead on three new songs, which, combined with a sound collage by the Geologist, make up this short EP. It's not as immediately obvious a pairing as the Banhart duet on <i>Rejoicing in the Hands</i> because Animal Collective's focus changes so radically from record to record and its priorities sometimes shift from ""songs"" per se to something else entirely. A thread through the band's work to this point has been a focus on the emotional content of sound, apart from the nuts and bolts of the music. Even with an acoustic and relatively pop record like <i>Sung Tongs</i> the textural fixations remain, if only in the droney guitar sum that's become something of an Animal Collective trademark. How Bunyan's approach would mesh wasn't entirely clear.</p><p>
<i>Prospect Hummer</i> turns out to be an inspired meeting, as Animal Collective's material meets her <em>Just Another Diamond Day</em> aesthetic halfway. The common ground for everyone involved turns out to be the small details and pastoral mood of rural life. Hearing the familiar guitar swells that opens ""It's You"" brings us immediately back to the screened porch where <i>Campfire Songs</i> was recorded, while the presence of Bunyan's voice transports to a different but equally remote place. It's like suddenly finding a cluster of Maryland pines rooted on an English moor, something out of a dreamy film, with a vaporous melody that wants to drift up to the stars. The EP's title song is filmic in a different way, conjuring 30s Disney, Bunyan the graceful Snow White with Animal Collective's faithful dwarves trailing merrily behind, with a ""wah-wah-wah"" chorus that's certainly a marching tune. Words are hard to make out but something like ""loved to run up the tree branch/ And in the middle of it is a puddle of water/ Wind of faithful voices"" covers three of the four elements in short order.</p><p>
    
    The Geologist provides the fire, though it's more of a low-level simmer, on his instrumental ""Baleen Sample"". He wasn't there for the London sessions but his five-minute contribution serves as a contrast with the three vocal songs, incorporating the strummed acoustic but layering in sound effects and various other instruments (nice use of steel drum) to create something comparatively dense. The brief and playful ""I Remember Learning How to Dive"" has the band singing in unison with Bunyan, ending the record on an appropriately communal note. It's a short EP, in fact it could almost fit onto a 7-inch single, but <i>Prospect Hummer</i> doesn't waste a note or a breathy sigh.</p></div>"|192.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/192-prospect-hummer-ep/|8.4|Mark Richardson

    plan for their band: Stay clear of the ""aww shucks"" cuteness and bring on the bluster. Aimee
    Argote and Tim Herzog make few intimations of companionship on their
    debut album, <i>Loose Lips Sink Ships</i>. When they do, it's in songs like
    ""No More Fighting Cats, OK"", which reads like a neo-feminist signpost
    on <em>Revolutionary Road</em>. ""You scrub that smell off of your body/ Have dinner with the family/ Start picking me up on time/ Stop
    taking my car when I tell you that it's mine for the night,"" sings a
    livid Argote. Hardly lovey-dovey, and neither is the sound. Dark and
    jangly, Des_Ark manage to be as loud as any larger band, but with the
    added intensity of their compensatory bashing.</p><p>
    
    Being at an inherent disadvantage volume-wise is actually a boon for
    many resourceful two-pieces-- especially those brandishing just guitar
    and drums. Stripped-down bands like Mates of State and the White
    Stripes (for whom balancing and mixing are less complicated endeavors
    than for, say, the Polyphonic Spree) can crank up the volume and
    utterly wail. Communication also becomes easier when there are fewer
    tastes to satisfy and voices to be heard. Unsurprisingly, then,
    Des_Ark are tight as Scarlet O'Hara's corset. Jammy influences pervade
    their screeching geetar-and-drums rock, but not in the traditional
    sense of unchecked soloing and rampant key changes. They're more
    scripted, nailing impressionistic odd-meter pirouettes and directing
    traffic through rhythmically congested passages.</p><p>
    
    Argote and Herzog may have some skills, but they ain't above the Rules
    of Rock, which clearly stipulate that you ought not overdissect your
    hooks, else they cease to live. Save standouts ""No More Fighting Cats,
    OK"" and ""Jesus Loves You (But Yr Still Comin' Home With Me Tonight)"",
    which turn in <i>Loose Lips</i>' stickiest vocal hook and most anthemic
    guitar line, respectively, Des_Ark are too preoccupied with pummel and
    contortion to offer palliative melodies. The album is forbiddingly
    opaque and often brutally heavy for the idiom-- indie rock-- under
    which it will probably be categorized. With only eight songs, you have
    to wonder if Des_Ark sensed it was all a bit overpowering. Even at a
    slender 28 minutes the album can be a slog. But then, controlled chaos
    seems to be their M.O. (much as it was for producer and former
    Dinosaur Jr. leading man J Mascis), and by that standard they're a
    roaring success.</p></div>"|2607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2607-loose-lips-sink-ships/|7.2|Sam Ubl

    and evil robots chortle as if Bearsuits' name was Yoshimi. Somewhere
    in an ever-expanding universe of guitar, synths, and stuff your
    short-lived bad-kid playground friend probably pickpocketed from 7/11,
    the guileless boy-girl vocals of Iain Ross and Lisa Horton chase
    high-fructose melodies that start, stop, and change directions in
    mid-air like a butterfly or a hovercraft.</p><p>
    
    Or: In what's shaping up to be a solid 12 months for arty indie-pop and
    schizophrenic noise-pop alike, English sextet Bearsuit lend the
    inspired innocence of the former to the joyous chaos of the latter.
    The gentle, melodic ""Cherryade"", with clip-clop percussion and May
    morning harmonies, could be The Boy Least Likely To or a more
    sonically adventurous Camera Obscura. ""Going Steady"" goes anything
    but, the frenzied energy of ""Popscene""-era Blur made weirder with
    herky-jerky changes and this year's nominee for Best Indie-Pop Comeback
    Instrument, the recorder. ""Cookie Oh Jesus"" and ""Itsuko Got Married""
    go off to the races with rapidfire handclaps and the whirligig
    aesthetic of peers like Bunky, or Deerhoof, or the Go! Team, or
    Architecture in Helsinki.</p><p>
    
    Or: ""Why are the machines so sad?"" wonders Ross on the wistful, (post-?)
    apocalyptic finale, ""On Your Special Day"". Shit, why indeed? It can't
    be cinematic opener ""Welcome to Bearsuit Hotel"", an instrumental
    unless you count Japanese spoken-word snippets! It's definitely not
    due to ""Rodent Disco"", 2:08 of fuzz, sirens, strobe lights, a (deaf?)
    dumb and blind kid, cheerleader chants (""disco!""), and all of the
    sudden the tape stopping-- then starting-- then a final 20 seconds
    of chintzy fucking Casio. Is it the infectious (ha!) Plague-prompted
    chorus of ""Prove Katie Wrong""? Maybe it's tinkly nonconformist ode
    ""Diagonal Girl"" (""don't get too straight"") or impatient
    short-song-with-long-name ""I Feel the Heat of the Light From Heaven"".</p><p>
    
    Or: Former John Peel favorites Bearsuit don't know a good thing when they see it,
    but they know not knowing is a better thing-- or another thing,
    anyway-- and that's all I know, except that once you open
    the can a fake snake jumps out (it's called love!) and everyone laughs

    After previous releases on Tigerbeat 6 and Foote's own Outward Music imprint, the group makes a wholly organic transition to the Kranky roster with <i>Cached</i>, an album that swerves lithely between percolating new-wave funk, gracious blasts of abstract electronic drone and scrape, and mesmeric dub-inflected sway-- often in a manner which unduly sacrifices distinctive group identity in favor of pursuing their next elusive phantom mutation.</p><p>
    
    During their time as members of chilly post-rockers Fontanelle, Foote and Dickow had occasion to put their fingerprints on recordings that were scrupulously edited and fussed-over to the point of sterility. Lesson apparently learned, on <i>Cached</i> the musicians maintain a much more rigorous and intuitive cycle of activity, naturally circulating an abundant pulse of fresh blood and vitality throughout the album's extremities. This (seemingly) more improvisational approach keeps the album from ever sinking into extended periods of frigid, monotonic stasis, although it also makes it more difficult for the listener to become truly ensnared in any of these sticky grooves for long.</p><p>
    
    Album opener ""Classic Mode"" sends <i>Cached</i> immediately soaring as it combines Owens' languid, wintry vocals with a deftly narcotic dance beat and elastic strands of melodic guitar and keyboards, providing instant gratification to any waylaid Out Hud aficionados in its path. This effortlessly captivating track sets an elevated standard that Nudge spends the remainder of the album trying to match, and they come quite close to doing so on the skeletal, rubber-limbed funk of ""Contact"" or the lurching, percussive ""Remove Ya"", which features several overheated exchanges between vintage keyboards, honking melodicas and Owens' whispered, wordless exhalations.</p><p>
    
    On ""Blon"", Nudge make their longest and most successful extended plunge into genre, maneuvering their way skillfully through a humid roots-dub landscape filled with the echoes of distant horns and murky waves of somnambulant keyboard throb. Less fruitful, unfortunately, are such electronic-based interjections as the motionless drone of ""Standing on Hot Sidewalk"" or the abrasive bounce of ""My New Youth"", ill-formed, insubstantial pieces that sound as though they could've originated from any number of lesser IDM acts. These tracks have an unflattering transitional quality, seeming almost as segues between the ample expanses of <i>Cached</i> where Nudge prove themselves able to boil on all burners, enticing the listener with their hopeful glimpses of the tantalizing peaks in the distance.</p></div>"|5910.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5910-cached/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

The bootleg record is really nothing more than a field recording of the glorious disaster that was Black Sabbath's Milwaukee 1980 gig. The tape captures the band and frontman Ronnie James Dio being unable to erase the misery of Ozzy's departure, and to make peace with the democratic revolt of their audience. The record could be a cause for cynics to dance on rock's grave for the 23rd time, God's Chosen People to cast stones at the golden calf worshippers, and middle-aged metalheads with 2.5 children, a solid credit rating, and Thomas Kinkade prints among their Frank Frazetta posters.</p><p>
    
    !!! drummer John Pugh showed me that record after fishing it out of a LP pile in his tiny car's trunk before his band played at a San Francisco gig. Now Warp reissues another of the band's recommendations-- the debut from Chok Rock, a Parisian glitch-hop unit that was discovered by a !!! band member at the Rough Trade record shop in London. Chok Rock materialized when Gael Baillier, a hard-lucked sound design businessman and guitarist, crashed into a few ships in the night: singer Camille Bazbaz (who calls their sound, ""A futuristic dampness impregnated with sex""), guitarist Cyril Kebellian, and visual artist Check Morris. They released their debut, <i>Big City Loser</i> on tiny label Chateau Rouge that went largely unnoticed until !!! passed along their record to the band's European label, Warp. Chok Rock certainly finds good company on that label as a few of their songs might be mistaken for Prefuse 73 B-sides and <i>Big City Loser</i>'s cover art of jumbled scrapbook imagery resembles that of <i>Extinguished: Outtakes</i>.</p><p>
    
    Still, these Parisians burn their fingerprints on the stereo. Opener, ""Give  It Up"" is a near 15-minute robo-funk track that vaguely recalls Akufen with its micro-edited synths and R&amp;B; croons. Midway through, a cloud of guitar steam breaks in to blow away leaves on the sidewalk. It's been said before, but it's a moment of old-fashioned music made seemingly new again with the right digital gloss. ""Buzz"" continues the electro element with higher calorie bassline, gnarlier guitarwork, and a stiffer groove that twitches shoulders, along with a sample of Beastie Boy King Ad Rock reminding everyone for the nth time, ""Ohmygod, that's the funky shit!"" ""Happy Man"" is more striking for announcing itself with a scream disintegrated in DSP fuzz before letting a George Clinton-like ladykiller croon through a CB radio on sprung ankle, crunk beats. And then there is the closer, ""Take a Plane"", where a bluesy, Sunday picnic jaunt with hookah-smoked flute is disrupted by editing mistakes and a looming UFO synth surveying the battlefield.</p><p>
    
    On second thought, any Prefuse 73 references are moot. As Big City Loser indicates, whoever in !!! came across this record in the crates has done a public service. Let's see how these Gallic blokes 'n' lasses take the game afoot. Cheers, mate.</p></div>"|1807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1807-big-city-loser-ep/|7.7|Cameron Macdonald

Though not the cohesive narrative its title implies, <i>The Saga of Mayflower May</i> again finds Nadler skillfully echoing the forms of traditional English balladry as she crafts another captivating collection of songs steeped in the melancholy of distant, half-forgotten passion, doomed love affairs, and various crimes of the heart.</p><p>
    
    As a vocalist Nadler is considerably less idiosyncratic than such peers as Joanna Newsom or Josephine Foster, and here her dusky, lived-in soprano settles diffusely between contemporaries like Hope Sandoval and Chan Marshall, and 60s-era folkies like Vashti Bunyan or Mimi Farina. On these 11 tracks her arrangements are kept simple and powder dry, typically featuring only her 12-string guitar and the occasional flourish of organ, ukelele, or flute as accompaniment.</p><p>
    
    With this spare instrumentation providing an understated backdrop, Nadler sounds increasingly relaxed and confident throughout the album, and each performance sparkles with haunting, rain-swept emotion. Tracks like ""The Little Famous Song"" and ""Horses and Their Kin"", are further distinguished by mesmerizing wordless passages where it almost sounds as though she's attempting to use her voice to approximate the lonesome shimmer of a singing saw.</p><p>
    
    The significance of the character Mayflower May to these songs is unclear. Nadler has previously described May-- who also made a couple appearances in the lyrics of <i>Ballads of Living and Dying</i>-- as a lonely old woman of faded beauty. And though May is never mentioned by name on any of these songs, perhaps one is to assume that nostalgia-laden, first-person accounts like the opening ""Under an Old Umbrella"" or the rapturous ""Calico"" are intended to feature May as narrator.</p><p>
    
    Also a talented visual artist, Nadler naturally fills her lyrics with color, and these songs abound with azure skies, turquoise eyes, and (especially) ruby red blood. On tracks like ""Yellow Lights"" and ""Mr. John Lee (Velveteen Rose)"" Nadler fearlessly enters traditional murder ballad territory, exquisitely depicting a world where love is forever shadowed by loss.</p><p>
    
    Curiously, for the dramatic ""Lily, Henry, and the Willow Trees"" the album's lyric sheet includes a final, particularly gory verse that leaves little doubt as to the fate of poor Lily. Perhaps finding these lines out of keeping with her music's otherwise deft, subtle touch, Nadler leaves them unsung, one of the few instances on this enthralling album where she pulls any punches whatsoever.</p></div>"|5908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5908-the-saga-of-mayflower-may/|7.8|Matthew Murphy

They also got drunk, got weird, got in fistfights with one another, took loads of drugs, walked off tour, and generally danced through some surreal Kabuki version of the Libertines' recent press. We're looking for a word and the word is ""tumult.""</p>
<p>Which makes it kind of striking that they also, during those same years, released three remarkable records that represent the first phase of their many-phased career. These albums are the latest in Rhino's series of two-disc deluxe-package reissues: Stylish smoke-and-mirrors new-wave on <i>Seventeen Seconds</i>, dark pop drama on <i>Faith, and all-out emotional assault on </i><i>Pornography</i>.</p>
<p>What's so remarkable about them? Start with <i>Seventeen Seconds</i>, which is a perfect example of the kind of record that's been subdivided out of existence-- a lying-in-bed-dreaming record, a guitar record that make no distinction between pop pulse, rock catharsis, and the atmospheric space we now mostly get from computers. With this album, it's all three at once-- all the austere, spooky grace of Robert Smith's Asian-art fixations gathering up to inhabit a clean, minimalist new-wave package. Album-accounting types might get antsy over how many of these tracks are about building mood, slinking along as the exact opposite of today's amaze-me-now aesthetics. But even the shiftiest of iPod types, buried beneath the covers some morning, will remember that an album like this doesn't work any other way. The sound is like a bare room with four guys in black occupying just enough space to let you wander on your own, and when they stop slinking around and let the pop move-- see ""Play for Today""-- they do it with incredible elegance, winking and posing from behind the smoke machine.</p>
<p>And then there's <i>Faith</i>, which sounds best of the three in about 60% of normal human moods. It's best in those bean-counting album-consistency more-for-your-money terms, sure, but that's hardly the big draw; the thrill here is hearing the Cure shape up into the singular band that trailed on through the next couple of decades. This is a band, after all, that did something indie guitar bands haven't lately been so great at-- tapping into vivid emotional drama in a form that felt entirely unpremeditated, creating a fantasy world coherent and accessible enough that your average 13-year-old didn't need to be up on any scenes to get sucked into it. A band whose career highlights were all about shading one intense emotion into another-- blurring the line between severe depression and total joy, making bright colors and Christmas seem like the mopiest things ever, and eventually, with <i>Disintegration</i>, making an album that was both oceanically bleak and entirely sparkly-beautiful, to the point where you imagine ghost-couples ballroom dancing to it.</p>
<p>It all takes shape on <i>Faith</i>. Just listen to ""The Funeral Party"", a gorgeous, slow-moving synth wash that anticipates both <i>Disintegration</i> and the theme from ""Twin Peaks"". This album winds its way from ultra-sophisticated pop thrills (""Primary"") to synth mope (""All Cats are Grey"") to fierce snarls (""Doubt"") to snakey exoticism (""Other Voices""), all without ever changing its raw, minimalist instrumental setup or really seeming to shift course at all. It's packed with effortless old-fashioned emotional communication; it's a stone-cold classic; and here we reach the point where critics temper fan-boy impulses and leave well enough alone.</p>
<p>All that emotional richness just brings us back to all that tumult, which somehow manages to color every inch of this material without laying hands on the performances: No matter how much the songs reek of crisis and desperation, the band seems as calm and on-point as a ballet troupe. That's precisely what makes <i>Pornography</i>-- which totally <i>owns</i> that other 40% of human moods-- work. This is one of those records where a band walks into the studio feeling stripped and grim and dedicates itself to creating something exactly as big and frightening, yelling at the producers that they really <i>want</i> that part to sound that ugly; Smith himself says he wanted the album to be ""virtually unbearable.""</p>
<p>Which would make this the best possible failure. The result isn't as double-dark bleak as people like to pretend, thanks to the same streaks of vigor and beauty that make it such an obvious precursor to <i>Disintegration</i>. Smith's said the two records are part of a trilogy, and you can hear exactly that: The minimalist sound gets abandoned for just the kind of big, booming drama they came back to at the end of the decade, and the tired wailing of a track like ""The Figurehead"" sounds perfectly natural next to something like ""Fascination Street"". The record's most harrowing moment turns out to be a single: ""The Hanging Garden"", which is mostly just the relentless pounding of a single drum, with Simon Gallup's signature bass sound (the moves of a snake and the same scaly texture) rumbling beside it. If Smith wanted ""unbearable,"" he should have hired a different singer, because his voice makes this-- and just about everything else-- completely thrilling.</p>
<p>Listen through any of these recordings, in fact, and you'll find yourself hanging on his every breath and moan, every word sounding as perfectly in-place as the well-groomed claps and trills of a chart-pop production. On ""The Hanging Garden"", he makes an understated wail hit you like a scream, which isn't a bad lesson for the world's hammier Iggy-wannabes: Half of the this stuff's wild intensity comes from how calm and steely-eyed and purposeful and just plain <i>sweatless</i> he sounds, and I can't imagine any other approach that could make a listener feel comfortable singing along with lines like ""Cover my face as the animals die."" Run the mood over to forlorn, and it's ""I could lose myself in Chinese art and American girls""; run it back to fierce, and it's ""It doesn't matter if we all die""-- just three of countless phrases that come out of his mouth sounding way more important than anyone else could manage.</p>
<p>So that's three of the discs; the bonuses are a whole other animal. With so much of the Cure's single and B-side output already heavily compiled, this series has mostly restricted its extras to the kind of source material that proves a serious feast for box-set-owning Cure geeks: Scratchy home demos, rough studio takes, live performances, and associated rarities. Most notable on <i>Faith</i> and <i>Pornography</i> are the mood-setting instrumentals from the films that introduced the band on tour (""Carnage Visors"" and ""Airlock""); with <i>Seventeen Seconds</i> it's the A- and B sides, studio and live, of the sole single by Cult Hero, the project Smith and Gallup used to test their musical compatibility. (It sounds like either Ian Dury or Jilted John.)</p>
<p>The rest of the <i>Seventeen Seconds</i> set offers some terrifically-recorded live material, as does the second disc of <i>Faith</i>; the Cure put a lot of studio time and echo-pressing power into giving Smith's voice the huge open-air sound these performances get pre-packaged. Across the rest of <i>Faith</i>'s extras, the rarities pick up into material that seems more than just archival. There's the much-loved ""Charlotte Sometimes"" single, but the real gems are a quartet of studio out-takes-- three surprisingly sprightly instrumental tests (Smith mostly just moans) and an early version of ""Primary"" that's pretty much a whole other equally good song. (Current acts who aren't Radiohead may take note of what writing in the studio can accomplish.)</p>
<p>Fullest of all, for obvious reasons, is the <i>Pornography</i> bonus; we're still working our way up to the sets of alternate takes and shelved songs that will probably accompany late-80s albums. Instrumental sketches of songs like ""Demise"" and ""Temptation"" can let you play Robert Smith at home (you are all of you welcome to record your own vocal tracks and send the results my way), and a totally-different early version of ""The Hanging Garden"" gives another weird look behind the tumult: Dysfunctional as the band may have been, they clearly still had the work ethic to write and rewrite songs until they turned out perfect. The live tracks here, sadly, aren't nearly as hi-fi as elsewhere.</p>
<p>And that, in six discs and too many words, is phase one of the Cure, neatly packaged and neatly slipcased. When Rhino started this series, the timing seemed appropriate: The new-wave revivalists may not have tried copping these moves yet, but bands like the Rapture certainly had. Listening through these albums, though, you might come to a different realization. Old-fashioned and rockist as these criteria may be, the fact is that these albums have a raw resonance that frees them almost entirely from time and trend. The next few packages, after all, will see them dance through any number of timely styles without losing that center. And by the time we reach the ones beyond that, they'll have created the teenage-escapist fantasy world for which they're most remembered-- one whose singular thrills haven't changed with time or age. I'm looking over the stacks, and I can't spot any other band I can say that about.</p></div>"|11706.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11706-seventeen-seconds-faith-pornography/|7.5|Nitsuh Abebe

The album was recorded with the four members huddled around a microphone, harmonizing and plucking mandolins, banjos and guitars, and you can practically hear the dimensions of the room they're standing in. This is straight bluegrass without a hyphen or a prefix-- it has nothing to do with pastiche, a pose, or modern country music. From first note to last, it's obvious these guys have done ample homework.</p><p>
    There's something refreshing about listening to an album recorded by guys who aren't afraid to unironically embellish an ending with a little ""yo-del-ay-hee"" or write simple, straightforward ballads that tell real stories with no gimmicks. Dave Wilson's lyrics are gloriously unpretentious as he takes the role of an inmate wondering aloud whether his wife will still be there when he gets out of prison on ""Arms of the Law"" or inhabits a hobo searching for warmth in the winter on ""Nowhere to Sleep"". They pale in comparison to the stunning title track, however, which tells the story of his father's business, a service station on Route 23 whose business all but dies when the state builds a new superhighway miles away-- apparently, Wilson's own father actually ran a hardware store that suffered a similar fate. What's truly striking about the way the story unfolds, though, is the lack of bitterness as Wilson refuses to cry over spilled milk.</p><p>
    Of course, it helps that the music is like some sort of majestic time machine. Wilson's voice is strong but not overbearing, weaving memorable melodies into his narratives, and the playing is expert but never sterile or clichd-- on ""Saro Jane"" they even let the music unfold into a sort of organic soundscape with shuddering mandolin and hovering fiddle.</p><p>
    The two instrumentals, fiddler/mandolinist John Teer's ""Gunfight in Durango"" and banjoist Chandler Holt's ""Sun Up"", are pumping two-step throw-downs, each bursting with wild banjo, fiddle, and mandolin. The harmonies are like a little slice of back-porch heaven: ""Louisiana Freight Train"" has the best, rich, swaying stacks of voices topped by guest Caitlin Cary that roll around the chords like clouds over the plains.</p><p>
    There a few songs that don't quite have the momentum of the album's best material, but for a new band writing starkly traditional bluegrass (they only play one cover on the whole album), this is shockingly strong material, occasional hiccups aside. Obviously, if you're not into old mountain music, there's nothing on here for you, but if you enjoy bluegrass, dig in. The highlights here are as good as it gets.</p></div>"|1806.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1806-route-23/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    that these landlubbers don't really know how to drop anchor or tie
    knots, but for some reason <em>really</em> dig <i>The Odyssey</i>. More
    esoterically, analyzing sine waves of noise trio Nautical Almanac's buzz offers
    evidence that freak-folk beards were inspired as much by
    Herman Melville as Devendra Banhart. Epilogue: Colin Meloy,
    eye-patch/life preserver/seabreeze facial cleaner, on Dickens'
    representation of shipyards.</p><p>
    
    Currituck Co. aka Kevin Barker aka a fine banjo, acoustic, and
    electric guitar player but somewhat sketchy songwriter has
    added a footnote to this potential book with <i>Ghost Man on Second</i>, a 2xCD journey more or
    less reenacting a ""fabled"" boat trip. Following last year's often
    engrossing sets of bastardized standards Ghost Man On First, it's the
    weaker part deux in a series of three meditations on ""trees, families,
    nautical exploration, and John Fahey's body."" The sea thing isn't
    overt: More obvious is the indebtedness to Fahey. And because a goodly
    journey deserves a return, there's a pairing-off of songs across disc
    one (""In Two Towards"") and disc two (""In Turn Returns""): ""Embark"" vs.
    ""Disembark,"" etc.</p><p>
    
    Besides conceptual ballast, improvisation provides the record's key
    methodology. Inspired by the blazing folk-raga and jazz drum pairings
    of renowned guitarist Sandy Bull and Billy Higgins, Barker's joined by
    Espers' Otto Hauser on the pitter-pat skins. Thus far Barker's done
    his best work by his lonesome: Hauser's a tentative
    player and seems to throw off Barker's timing. The drumming is also oddly
    mixed, sounding as if KB's standing on deck with Hauser locked in
    the ship's bowels. I get the polyphonic effect they're attempting,
    but it doesn't work.</p><p>
    
    On various levels, <i>Ghost Man on Second</i> is in need of an edit. Thirty-minute excursions 
    like ""Space Cruisin' Boogie (Remix)"" are admirably epic, but you
    really do need to earn a sitcom-length track.
    Nod here to Henry Flynt. And again for Sunburned Hand of the Man. Oh,
    and Supreme Dicks, please.</p><p>
    
    A second disc-two ramble, ""Don't the C Look Wide and Deep"", finds Barker
    and Hauser
    losing synch: drums slip here and there, guitars lose track of
    themselves. Besides ""Disembark""'s intriguing banjo and Turkish drum
    dual, disc two's dead weight. It's a surprisingly sloppy and
    plodding set. (For a more inspired take, Ben Chasny and Chris Corsano
    kick up a maelstrom on Six Organs of Admittance's <i>School of the
    Flower</i>.)</p><p>
    
    The stronger moments are on disc one. The launch of ""Embark"" could
    be Jewelled Antler playing a drum set's hardware. And ""My Home""
    is an upbeat acoustic piece with vocals. Admittedly, Barker sometimes
    sounds like Kermit the Frog, but his sentiments about eschewing the Top
    40 (""back 40 be my home..."") are sort of funny, or at least honest. On sister song,
    ""Where Is My Friend?"", the ""It's Not Easy Being Green"" melody is even a bit
    noticeable.</p><p>
    
    Barker also just released <i>Sleepwalks in the Garden of the Deadroom</i> on
    Track &amp; Field. It's a stronger, more cohesive jaunt, drifting into a
    singer/songwriter vein. So maybe this is seen as a collection of
    outtakes? Or outer-realm stuff that couldn't make it elsewhere?
    Whatever its lack, Barker/Hauser can't be faulted for attempting
    oceanic sprawl, but when players aren't razor-sharp regarding improv's
    ebb and flow, noodling grows ponderous fast. Here, instead of
    covering ground like true-blue Impulse!/Siren worthy explorers,
    Currituck Co.'s just treading water.</p></div>"|1759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1759-ghost-man-on-second/|5.9|Brandon Stosuy

But it's survived and thrived while a succession of fickle post-rave fads have come and gone. Like many dance shops, BS spun off into a label. The <i>Breakbeat Science Exercise</i> series of low-price mix CDs are handy examples of the kind of d'n'b that skews more to the center than leftfield. They don't leave you feeling walloped with a 2X4, but you don't feel like you got suckered into buying <i>Ultra Chill 6</i>, either.</p><p>
    
    So it's exciting that DJ Clever (owner of Offshore Records, mixmeister of last year's epochal <i>Troubled Waters</i>, and recent Pitchfork profilee) has been handed such an expansive platform to do his leftfield thing. (The Exercise mixes land in the megastores, like the aforementioned Borders.) Clever's got a knack for the sugared-pill: mixing up the rough (ridonkulously convoluted drum tricknology) with the smooth (the rolling boom-bap that's characterized post-1998 d'n'b). It's a line that gets skidded across on every Offshore release.</p><p>
    
    Unsurprisingly, given the venue and audience's expectations, he goes with more smooth than rough. Even the more ""edit-y"" tracks here wouldn't clear a dancefloor. Some are even (gulp!) kinda boring, like the distorted drums of Cujo's slightly plodding ""Time Traveller"". Graphic's ""I Am Metal"" would be too sparse by half-- just a heavy-stepping beat and a tunneling bassline-- but finds its offbeats in Beans' rapping. (""I'm a rap motherfucker/ Wrap my hands around your neck."")</p><p>
    
    Black Rain, aka Omni Trio's Rob Haigh, rocks the drum machine he once said he could never return to, skirting closer to the ""tech-house at 170bpm"" feeling of his old pal Deep Blue (who precedes him here) than the breakbeat euphoria of old. Amit's only got one trick, but I understand why so many labels keep re-releasing it: The scowling, strangely muted, utterly hypnotic mid-tempo bassline he's perfected. I don't hear much of the oft-referenced ""dub"" in his sound; it's closer to something like the Wighnomy Brothers ""Wurz + Blosse"" on Kompakt. Pieter K's ""Sequence"", on the other hand, is one of those too-fast pop-locking beats I suspect only breakdancing robots who catch on fire can keep up with.</p><p>
    
    The mix really achieves lift-off in its final third. Seba's ""Steel"" trots out the old techstep trick of juggling one beat with a harder secondary beat, albeit in a warmer (yet still spooky) context. After the cold, electro-tinged basslines of a lot of the tracks here, its enveloping low-end is a balm. Graphic's remix of Ezekiel Honig's ""Love Sessions"" is the best track here and one of the oddest and most compelling d'n'b tunes I've ever heard. It's microhouse, essentially, except 50bpm faster, with great yawning bass groans, flushes of moody synth, and ultra-tactile beats. Imagine Pantytec jamming on ""Drop It Like It's Hot"" with added tape-speed issues. Tundra's ""Deep Sleep"" follows in a similar vein, though a bit more straightforwardly drum'n'bass, another excellent renovation of the supposedly exhausted 2-step percussion pattern.</p><p>
<i>Exercise 05</i>'s dancefloor-centricity means it lacks Troubled Waters' range. And that's fine; drum'n'bass isn't required to expand or contract to fit a Pitchfork reader's (or writer's!) idea of excitement. This is probably a little too fast, a little too banging, to win converts. But there are still a number of tunes here that support all the breathless prose I've devoted to the d'n'b revival in the past 12 months. And at a suggested retail of around $7.99, you can probably afford to skip a meal to check out what all the fuss is about. I'm just going to keep bugging you until you do.</p></div>"|2578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2578-breakbeat-science-exercise-05/|7.2|Jess Harvell

    IDM, and although the second track with Doseone is entitled ""My Winter 
    Vacation"", <i>Queue for Love</i>'s gentle electronica evokes the first rays of 
    spring and the slow thawing that follows.</p><p>
    
    From the first track, it's clear Mangia is a talented imitator: ""The Breakfast Drama"" lays down the same layered, organic sounds as the opener to Four Tet's <i>Rounds, without the sophisticated percussion. Later, ""Pawn Shop Close"" recalls Prefuse 73, 
    from its hiccuping beats to the clipping of the string sample over 
    top.</i></p><p>
    
    Populous plunders the same bottomless 
    musical mines as his more accomplished contemporaries (Four Tet, Prefuse, DJ Shadow), taking samples and beats from late 60s/early 70s soul and jazz and creating immaculate constructions. But while those artists dazzle technically, their samples, beats, and timing also unravel minor epiphanies, where 
    repetition meets melody in a moment of euphoria. Populous has the samples and 
    the skills-- ""Maqam Saba"" alone proves it, moving from multi-layered 
    growling percussion to airy jazz guitar in the space of three minutes-- 
    but <em>Queue for Love</em> is starved for those kinds of memorable 
    moments.</p><p>
    
    Guest vocals help the cause, but even the lovely tenor of Matilde (of 
    Studio Davoli) on ""Bunco"" or ""Clap Like Breeze"" is a passionless 
    texture. The best tracks are mysteriously back-loaded: ""Canoe Canoa"" loops 
    graceful classical guitar over breakbeats, and ""Drop City"" 
    is the funkiest this mild-mannered album gets.</p><p>
    
    ""My Winter Vacation"" fares better, with Doseone relaxing his flow and 
    turning subtle vocal modulations into self-harmonizing, as the ringing 
    triangles and laid-back beats congeal into an inviting pastiche. From 
    <em>Queue for Love</em>, there's no way to tell if Populous can use his 
    sample library for distinct ends, or if he's just another non-face in the 
    crowd, but I'll continue to play ""My Winter Vacation"" long into the 
    summer.</p></div>"|6571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6571-queue-for-love/|6.5|Jason Crock

    resorting to hyperbole can drive a critic mad. The pertinent signifiers have already been spread
    thin: Ye olde faythful Beatles/Beach Boys axis of anonymity pertains
    in theory, but it's become synonymous with vacant pop blandstanding
    and doesn't do justice to Matthew Adam Hart's oversaturated sugar
    smacks. It seems improbable that two of the most innovative bands of
    the rock era have become the myopic critic's go-to comparison for
    every poppy, harmonizing mediocrity that's too redundant to say
    anything else about, but here we are. There is something
    <em>Smile</em>-y about the voluminous synth swirls and donkey-punch
    drums that buffer the cherub harmonies of ""2 Dots on a Map"", but you
    know what? Forget I mentioned the Beatles or the Beach Boys.</p><p>
    
    Then there's ""bedroom pop,"" which conjures faltering confessional
    lyrics, feeble electronic afterthoughts, maybe some detuned toy piano
    and tape-hissy ambiance. It's true that Hart records his songs on a
    shoestring budget, in his bedroom in Ontario. He might even swaddle
    himself in warm quilts and rock Garanimals footie-pajamas when he
    records, for all I know. And it's true these songs might lose some of
    the alien luster with a glossier studio treatment. But unlike bedroom
    pop's typically gauzy and fractured mien, Hart's tunes are confidently
    solid and percussion-heavy, rotundly popping, locking and soaring. On
    ""Sentiments Vs. Syllables"", a prickly metallic twinkle chases the
    vocal line around a mechanically precise bass drum, and ""Why You Gotta
    Do That Thing?"" is a woozy monkey-bar swing over halting, carefully
    rattling percussion and zippering synth trills. Nothing is
    self-consciously fractured or haphazard; the songs hang shaggily on
    rigid compositional armature. You know what? Forget I mentioned
    bedroom pop.</p><p>
    
    Having exhausted our options, save for the requisite Flaming
    Lips/Magnetic Fields comparisons, we're left with hyperbole and
    lunacy. Hart's third LP, <em>Our Thickness</em>, is an exuberantly
    echoing starburst of lo-fi twee-pop gone grand, an opulent boudoir
    popera for the Taj Mahal. A crashfest of cheapo synths, poppity drums,
    and spun-sugar vocals, almost clownishly oversized: Check the loopy
    brass pageantry of ""Paul Simon"" or the sopping wet synths of ""Still
    Life"". It's an IMAX epic shot on Super8 and projected onto a bed
    sheet, a sumptuous coronation parade in a snowglobe, a theme park made
    of Tinker Toys: ""Our Pen's Out of Ink"", all distorted ba-ba-bas and
    jittery piano, and ""Incandescent Hearts"", with its foggy bleats and
    shimmering upsweeps, are postage-stamp epics, majestic in miniature.

So before you Yankee industrial buffs ravenously rip open your long-awaited copies of NIN's <i>With Teeth</i>, pause for urbanity's sake and acknowledge the visionary whose innovation eventually made everyone in the mid-90s want to ""fuck you like an animal""-- London's own J.G. Thirlwell, aka Foetus.</p><p>
    
    Thirlwell's foray into mainstream industrial rock in the mid-90s almost destroyed him, literally. After his 1995 Sony release <i>Gash</i>, Thirlwell suffered from creative block and alcoholism for six years until triumphantly emerging with 2001's <i>Flow</i>, a resuscitation of the gnashing, sepulchral sound that made him an industrial pioneer.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, on <i>Love</i> Thirlwell has neither shaken off all the rust nor decided to progress his sound any further since <i>Gash</i>. He's still Trent Reznor with a monocle, juxtaposing electronic drumbeats with Baroque-era harpsichord, referencing literary figures like Dorian Gray and occasionally singing in French. Feeling cultured yet? Don't. While including more melodic vocals in place of throat-chafing screams may be Thirlwell's riskiest move on <i>Love</i>, it totally tanks due to, well, the fact that Thirlwell's voice is abominable. We're not talking Jimi Hendrix or Bob Dylan bad here; this guy's tone-deaf sneer is utterly repulsive. On ""Don't Want Me Anymore"" he can barely stay on pitch for more than two beats, deflating the song's epic five-minute build. ""Mon Agonie Douce"" features plenty of film noir-inspired bells and whistles but little artistry, and Thirlwell's affected nasal crooning only compounds the problem.</p><p>
    
    Now I know I've been avoiding describing the music, but you all know the selling points with Foetus: Grating, crunchy, layered, intricate, et al. <i>Love</i>'s massive strings, sleazy film noir numbers and visceral guitar riffs will undoubtedly captivate fans of their last, oh, dozen or so albums. Thirlwell sticks to what he knows best on <i>Love</i>, but ultimately he sounds too much like an artist just happy to still be making records. Maybe it's because since the mid-90s the industrial sound has been picked up, dusted off, and mass-produced by snot-noised hacks like Linkin Park and Evanescence, or because listeners are blowing their synth/electronic music load on New Wave poseurs like the Bravery and Killers, but either way. Foetus's pissy eat-shit-and-die bit just doesn't have the bite it used to.</p></div>"|3128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3128-love/|6.0|Adam Moerder

On <i>Essence</i> and especially <i>World Without Tears</i>, she replaced the Southern storytelling, travelogue nature, and plainspoken poetry of her breakthrough with an increasingly confessional tone and a decreasingly friendly voice. Her disposition has never been exactly sunny and her voice has always been a little gauzy, but she's grown defiantly prickly; as she obsessed over a broken relationship, wondering how it could cause as much happiness as pain, her songs have become more emotionally explicit, her voice more boozily abrasive. ""Ghosts in the wind that blow through my life/ Follow me wherever I go,"" she sings on ""Bus to Baton Rouge"", ""I'll never be free from these chains inside/Hidden deep down in my soul.""</p><p>
    
    This trend toward extreme introversion crystallizes with <i>Live @ the Fillmore</i>, recorded over two nights in San Francisco. While the double live album is a time-honored tradition, Williams makes it immediately clear that this isn't going to be <i>Double Live Gonzo!</i> or <i>Frampton Comes Alive!</i> The first disk begins not with the requisite upbeat showstarter (although this version of ""Real Live Bleeding Fingers and Broken Guitar Strings"" would have been perfect both sonically and thematically), but with a slow ballad-- three of them, in fact. Obviously, this is not the Lucinda Williams of the <em>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</em> tour (chronicled on a New West Records DVD, released concurrently).</p><p>
    
    The 22 songs on these two disks are culled mainly from <i>Essence</i> and <i>World Without Tears</i>, with only a few from <i>Car Wheels</i>, <i>Sweet Old World</i>, and <i>Lucinda Williams</i> (and none from her first two albums). Instead of leading us through the South of ""Crescent City"" and ""Jacksonville"", Williams takes us first out to California on ""Ventura"", one of only three geographically defined songs on the set (""Pineola"" and ""Bus to Baton Rouge"" being the others). Almost compulsively Williams airs her sins and misgivings on songs like ""Fruits of My Labor"", ""Three Days"", and ""Are You Down"", sounding both gushing and guarded. But her vocals, even on talking-blues songs like ""Sweet Side"" and ""Righteously"", reveal a woman living through all the messy frustration and unalleviated desire she's singing about.</p><p>
    
    After a deliberately slow start, <i>Live @ the Fillmore</i> picks up considerably toward the end of the first disk. Williams spits venom on ""Changed the Locks"" and ""Atonement"", while her backing band, especially guitarist Doug Pettibone, generates ferocious bar-blues rock. The second disk reverses that trajectory, starting hard and fast but ending soft. The barreling momentum of ""I Lost It"" and ""Joy"" gradually gives way to the sexual/narcotic fervor of ""Essence"", the low simmer of ""Are You Down"", and the faltering disappointment of ""American Dreams"", which sounds even more like diluted Springsteen in this setting.</p><p>
    
    The old Lucinda of <i>Car Wheels</i> reappears briefly on the final two tracks (both of which, ironically, postdate that album). She's there in the detailed memories and interior drama of ""Bus to Baton Rouge"" as well as in the delicate vibrato of ""Words Fell"". Both tracks are a little more hopeful than the equally gentle ones that begin this set, suggesting Williams has managed to exorcise some of those ghosts blowing through her life.</p></div>"|8689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8689-live-the-fillmore/|7.3|Stephen M.

Their funk was no less stark or 
    forbidding 
    than, say, the more astringent Timbaland productions. They certainly 
    weren't 
    as twitchy, speedy, or noisy as James Brown at his most energized. 
    Their 
    great innovation-- Andy Gill's morse code guitar, as if playing a riff 
    for 
    more than a few bars caused him physical pain-- is post-punk's most 
    ripped-off idea after badly played disco drums. They had attitude, 
    energy, 
    the big beat, skilled players funneling their virtuosity into the 
    necessary 
    notes, a handy way with a catch phrase, and sweaty live performances. 
    Sounds 
    like pop to me.</p><p>
    
    They formed in 1977 as part of a scene surrounding Leeds University's 
    fine 
    arts department that also included the Mekons and the Au Pairs. They 
    were 
    art students who named themselves after the Maoists that ran China 
    until the 
    leader's death in 1976. But they bonded over pub rockers Dr. Feelgood 
    and 
    70s British blues band Free, exactly the sort of dinosaur hard rock 
    post-punk was supposed to have purged in its own Cultural Revolution. 
    The 
    seeming contradiction, at least in terms of the Good Music Society the 
    music 
    press was constructing at the time, might have explained their sound, 
    which 
    critic Simon Reynolds described as a ""checked and inhibited hard rock: 
    cock 
    rock [with] the cock lopped off.""</p><p>
    
    Andy Gill kept his guitar chilly, without the blanket of fuzz provided 
    by 
    effects pedals and the agreeable tone of valve amps. Blues riffs do 
    crop up, 
    but it's almost as if Gill is playing against his technique, scattering 
    them 
    like fishes in a pond with a scrabble of notes. He rarely engages in 
    anything like a solo, the ejaculation part of cock rock. Gill's playing 
    approaches rock drama through dynamics. On ""Return the Gift"" he's a 
    shrill 
    S-O-S pattern underneath the weight of Dave Allen's bass on the 
    choruses, a 
    flinty, almost Derek Bailey-like anti-solo. On ""(Love Like) Anthrax"", he sounds like he's trying 
    to 
    split concrete with a garden spade on a congested street. The guitars 
    on 
    ""Natural's Not In It"" are actually kind of <i>sexy</i>, in an 
    uncomfortable 
    frottage sort of way.</p><p>
    
    The band says they were trying to get Allen to play a ""quarter of the 
    notes 
    he was actually capable of playing,"" which must be a pretty alarming 
    number 
    given his busyness on tracks like ""Damaged Goods"". The bass is the only 
    fluid part of Go4's sound, and even that's more croaky than bubbling. 
    On 
    ""Ether"" there's no bassline to speak of, just big bullfrog gulps as the 
    guitar clangs, bell-like, and a sinister high-noon melodica whistles in 
    the 
    distance. Drummer Hugo Burnham played funk beats and disco snare crashes but 
    with 
    all the reverb stripped off so that they splashed like alcohol. He's 
    the 
    band's secret weapon, and stuff like the hard snare crack that sounds 
    like a 
    handclap on ""Not Great Men"" is often what makes a song. When they all 
    locked 
    in, as on ""I Found That Essence Rare"", the effect is like stuffing 10 
    pounds of funk into a five-pound bag.</p><p>
    
    Emotionally, however, <i>Entertainment!</i> is a brick. Like a black hole, no 
    romanticism escapes it. Hints of black humor (especially in the 
    artwork) 
    creep into their aesthetic without overwhelming it. Relationships are 
    reduced to ""contract[s] in our mutual interest."" Jon King often sings 
    in the 
    first person, implicating himself before anyone else: ""I can't work/ I 
    can't 
    achieve""; ""how can I sit and eat my tea with all that blood flowing 
    from the 
    television?"" Out of one speaker, Gill drones the production details of 
    the 
    love song like a bored copywriter on ""Anthrax"", concluding 
    ""we 
    just don't think what goes on between two people should be shrouded in 
    mystery."" Out of the other speaker, King moans that he ""feel[s] like a 
    beetle on its back/ And there's no way for me to get up.""</p><p>
    
    Hardly head over heels, Go4 continually recast ""I Want To Hold Your 
    Hand"" as 
    a death grip dragging you under. Go4 interrogated <i>everything</i>, 
    including 
    the band itself, with the kind of rigor only middle-class white art 
    students 
    can afford. But then they were a very English band, very much of a 
    moment 
    where being politically active precluded any sort of irony. (And 
    besides, 
    Bush/Blair may be as scary as Reagan/Thatcher, but Bloc Party aren't 
    scrapping with Nazis at every other show.) Not for nothing was the band 
    that 
    really took their sound into the mainstream the Red Hot Chili Peppers, 
    hardly models of good Marxist propriety. Even the recent, more 
    stylistically 
    faithful post-punk revival bands wouldn't poo-poo a love song.</p><p>
    
    It would have been interesting to imagine Gang of Four as not just a pop band but as proper pop stars, 
    because 
    they would have been the driest pop stars ever. But instead, they 
    refused to 
    change a lyric the BBC found offensive for a planned ""Top of the Pops"" appearance, which effectively sunk their chart hopes. By 
    the 
    time they were ready to insert tongue-in-ass, no one wanted to hear 
    their 
    too slick take on what constituted ""pop."" Sometimes the people really 
    do 
    want it raw. Though they once might have looked askance at becoming an 
    institution (of sorts), at least you can once again easily buy one 
    of 
    the great rock albums, now expanded with eight additional tracks. Anyone who says it's played out is a douchebag 
    who 
    deserves his Medium Medium records and willful obscurity. And that's 
    one 
    thing that I don't want to catch.</p></div>"|3389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3389-entertainment/|9.5|Jess Harvell

As a fresh-faced misanthropic hottie screaming about god, money, and
    the two-backed beast over a 'roid-ragin' <i>Tron</i> soundtrack, he was exactly what the kids wanted.  But when Reznor journeyed
    into the center of his sound and his soul, the kids took a rain check, finding their fix of synthesized cathartic self-loathing
    elsewhere.  (Linkin Park, I think you might owe somebody a thank-you card; ask Reznor about the one he sent to Wax Trax! Records.)</p><p>
    
    In 1996, the dude was so money that an EP of <em>Downward Spiral</em> remixes went gold, while both NIN full-lengths were well on
    their way to multi-platinum status.  But in 2004, a full-length remix album covering the entire NIN oeuvre festered on the shelves
    of mall record stores, while Reznor's then most-recent studio LP (the double-your-pleasure doozy known as <em>The Fragile</em>) was
    shipping a measly one million copies.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, the Bennington-Shindoa think tank (and their many contemporaries) were setting both young pierced hearts and old moneyclips
    aflutter with sexless, sample-soaked tunes of dismay and despair.  Where once they screamed, ""You get me closer to God!,"" kids now
    shouted, ""Shut up when I'm talking to you!,"" which is in line with, ""I'd rather die than give you control!"", except Reznor's ""you""
    is some disembodied existential thing, the stuff of stylized drama.  Chester's ""you"" is someone he knows; this time, it's personal,
    and he wrote it down in his journal.  In AABB form.</p><p>
    
    In 2005, Reznor kicks off <em>With Teeth</em> with ""All the Love in the World"", a track that can easily be read as a response to his
    fading celebrity in the wake of the success of countless imitators (""No one's heard a single word I've said/ They don't sound as
    good outside my head"").  From the start, it seems he's about to go spelunking up his colon yet again, ninth-grade poetry in tow.
    It begins pensively, with a wet drum machine beat punctuated by soft piano notes while Reznor asks the question on nobody's mind:
    ""Why do you get all the love in the world?""  And then comes the disco break.</p><p>
    
    The beat locks down. The piano gets in line. Reznor returns to the titular question-- this time in a falsetto-- and screams it back,
    call-and-response style, harmonizing with himself. A bass drum, tambourine, and backing vocals hop on board.  And when the bassline
    kicks in, and it's as though he's dropping a mirror ball on Goth Night at Club Velvet, as all the young Robert Smiths and Siouxsie
    Siouxs in the crowd proceed to drop it like it's hot.  ""All the Love"" has nothing on the porn-serious bump-and-grind of ""Closer"",
    but it's not trying to horn in on that action.  For about 90 seconds, there's an epidemic of full-on Kool and the Gang dance
    fever-- and it actually sounds fantastic.</p><p>
    
    On ""Only"", Reznor speak-sings his way to each chorus, playfully talking about picking scabs and other sorts of self-castigating
    things. And, wow, what a ridiculous chorus: ""There is no fucking you/ There is only me.""  It's like he's singing to himself in the
    mirror, either restaging the Buffalo Bill scene from <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, or the Jena Malone/Susan Sarandon hairbrush bit
    from <em>Stepmom</em>.  ""You Know What You Are"", meanwhile, is in line with what typifies hyper-aggressive NIN teeth-gnashing, though
    it's accentuated with the unmistakable might of Dave Grohl on the traps, ripping off those machine-like 16th notes.  Elsewhere, lead
    single ""The Hand That Feeds"" finds some on-the-one magic, while ""Getting Smaller"", the record's poppiest track, comes off as a
    faster-paced cousin of Pixies' ""Planet of Sound"" (with a Pere Ubu quote thrown in for you hipster cats).  And let's not leave the
    Mark E. Smith nod from ""With-ah Teeth-ah"" unmentioned.</p><p>
    
    As expected, the album does eventually find time for a brief detour into the sort of twinkling soundscaping that's perfect for
    staring off into space and forgetting the pains of quotidian torture, but for the most part, <em>With Teeth</em> manages to flip the
    script on Reznor's recent M.O.  Instead of fronting like a more feminine Al Jourgensen-- hard, coarse, yet not totally abrasive--
    Reznor comes across as the masculine yin to Shirley Manson's alluring yang: playful, coy, and with a flair for the dramatic.</p><p>
    
    The disc ends with the tortured Bowie-esque balladry of ""Right Where It Belongs"".  Here, Trent's piteous ruminations on what-the-hell-ever--
    (""What if all the world you think you know/ Is an elaborate dream?"") are slyly undercut by an audience's cheers and applause. It's
    Reznor as a leather-clad Elton John, sitting at the piano to play ""Candle in the Wind"" one more time.  But rather than indulging in
    a pointless rehashing of past glories, <em>With Teeth</em> finds Trent Reznor moving forward by coming to terms with what he hath
    wrought.  This head like a hole's come a long way, baby.</p></div>"|5803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5803-with-teeth/|6.5|David Raposa

But live the band is far less efficient. Sometimes they take eternities to pop, masking their moves with insider theater-punk and the vicious tease of frontwoman Caitlin Cook's jacket-only costumes. Blah, what are we waiting for exactly? With these guys I feel like I'm playing Ouija: I sense their secret language and know from experience their all-night junior high seance bit actually goes somewhere pretty fantastic. Excepter never crack though-- they're burlesque, the best sort of infuriating.</p><p>
     
    But again, we don't get that from <i>KA</i>-- porno-pop by comparison. Even Excepter's <a href=""http://www.excepter.com/html/music.html#"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>live recordings</u></a> lie a bit, since the gig's never just a withhold/release audio event and the band leans on drama to hook the camera-phone polloi. So here's <i>Throne</i>, a massive piecemeal of patient, throbbing noise, more molasses than anything I've seen them do live, somewhat demanding because everything <i>does</i> come together, spelled out in its own frustratingly roundabout way, as a good an example of this something-from-nothing stuff we can ask for from the latest crop of alchemists.</p><p>
    
    ""Getting"" this band always wants to be an issue. Musically, they're full of shit; that's the point though. Excepter don't buy exclusively into music, but instead incorporate elements of music-- rhythm, melody, lyrics occasionally-- into their much larger project of sound. In other words, If you don't like how the band physically sounds, they're not worth your time. There's nothing to get about this band at all in that sense, since at least initially they're about sound on body, no encryption key for your pleasure, no computational step needed.</p><p>
     
    That said, the difference between Excepter and just some pleasant sound (which so much of this shit is, really) is an unspeakable logic past the entrance point of pleasure-- the multiple threads mutating and interacting with one another all the time, some the band's piecing together for us, others left for us to make sense of ourselves. I know that sounds hoaxy, but <i>something</i> takes ""Jrone (Two)"" in 15 imperceptible minutes from a beautiful mess to a beautiful mess that growls and pulsates and wades in contradiction. Something takes ""The Heart Beat"" from a literal, pneumatic romp into hoarse overtones and palpable hopelessness. Something takes ""Jrone (Three)"" from Cook's shapeless rants to the record's most telling moment of clarity, Cook singing to us, ""It's not a simple formula it only is mine."" That means exactly nothing to me-- just a little bit of everything.</p></div>"|2913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2913-throne/|8.2|Nick Sylvester

    side project, and please don't stop reading. Lap-pop is to emo-tinged
    indie rock as emo was to third-wave ska, aren't you on the listserv?
    Where Service-man Ben Gibbard found digital bubblegum (and offline
    gold!), Bazan trawls through his usual narrative-driven mope-rock
    balladry, for better or for worse. But never worse than the name
    Headphones, so emo kids, it's almost finally safe to show your
    bespectacled faces and stop pretending you like Death From Above 1979.</p><p>
    
    After the bland misfire that was last year's <em>Achilles Heel</em>,
    Headphones' debut offers some hope for lapsed Pedro-philes. On ""Hot
    Girls"", Bazan and co-'phones Tim Walsh (Pedro the Lion, TW Walsh) and
    Frank Lenz (Starflyer 59) come their closest to the Postal dudes'
    ""Such Great Heights"". It's as perky as Bazan gets-- think an
    electro-pop ""Indian Summer""-- and the lyrics smile sidelong at the
    notion that ""style is taking over"" and ""songs are on their way out.""
    If Headphones have any shot at <em>The O.C.</em>, this is it.</p><p>
    
    Yet Bazan's latest is much more Edgar Allan Poe than Phantom Planet.
    <em>Headphones</em> turns dark early, with the opening murder/arson and
    insomniac synths of ""Gas and Matches"". On ""Hello Operator"", a cuckold
    strangles his ex-lover through the telephone to live, pounding drums
    and ghostly sonar signals. Bazan may be indiedom's second-favorite
    Christian, but as adultery-laden 2002 concept album <em>Control</em>
    proved, he's at his best moaning slow-motion stories about sin. ""Slow
    Car Crash"" closes the disc with futile airbags and touching last
    I-love-yous, glacial tempo befitting its title.</p><p>
    
    The disc's two most blatantly political tracks stick out like severed
    thumbs, each pointing a different way. Veritable Bush bio ""Natural
    Disaster"" lays into Dear Leader with the album's second-sprightliest
    melody, but oh fuck Saddam what a refrain: ""Maybe a couple of
    airplanes/ Could crash into buildings/ And put the fear of God in
    you."" You know, I once used that as a pickup line. By contrast the
    previous track, ""Major Cities"", is as subtle as ""Natural Disaster"" is
    preachy. As (terrorist?) attacks decimate an empire, Bazan's doomed
    narrator admits, ""This doesn't favor me/ Still bullies ought to get
    what's coming."" Bazan's vocal sounds almost like Stephin Merritt's
    near-cracking lower range from ""Love Is Like a Bottle of Gin"", and
    spare, orderly keyboard accompaniment only highlights the
    similarities. It's a deft representation of the current political
    climate's many terrifying paradoxes. Against all expectations, my
    vote's for the dude from Pedro.</p></div>"|4008.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4008-headphones/|7.0|Marc Hogan

Martin Luther King Drive in Chicago sits the specter of a building, a crumbling greystone indistinguishable from the thousands like it that litter the city's South Side. But this house has a unique and bizarre history as the focal point of one the strangest chapters in Chicago's musical history, that of Arrow Brown and his Bandit label. It's a chapter that's been mostly skipped over to this point, but that shouldn't obscure the fact that Brown's completely under-the-table recording company/commune/harem produced a clutch of impressive, honey-drenched soul tracks in its 12 years of operation.</p><p>
    The late Arrow Brown was by all accounts a shady character, a Mississippi boy who transplanted to Chicago during the Great Migration and in his early adulthood looked to be living the American dream, with a family and a steady job at a soup cannery. But somewhere in the 1960s, he veered onto a different path, leaving his family behind for the seedy underground of the Second City, finally emerging in 1969 in that greystone, subsisting off the welfare checks of the nearly one dozen women he lived and likely consorted with. The Bandit story begins here, as Brown's wild weekend parties gave way to recording sessions featuring a huge cast of inspired amateurs and moonlighting professionals, who played uncredited to skirt musicians' union rules.</p><p>
    In spite of the less-than-official arrangement, these are some truly hi-fi recordings, full of incredible string and horn arrangements, inventive backing vocals and funky rhythm sections that don't miss a Motown-inspired note. Though Brown used the singers at his disposal almost interchangeably, a few stand out as huge talents, including Brown's own daughter, Tridia. She was a member, such as one could be, of the label's flagship group, the Arrows, later the Majestic Arrows, and she was a great foil for the magnificent, sweet soul falsetto of Larry Johnson, a hugely talented singer who certainly could have gone places had he recorded for a label with the means to get him there. The two of them trade verses on the Majestic Arrows' ""Another Day"", a sweeping soul ballad that typifies Bandit's sweet, orchestral r&amp;b; aesthetic.</p><p>
    Another would-be star is Linda Balintine, whose two tracks are tough and funky, but the most tragic loss unearthed here is Johnny Davis. Davis was a powerful soul crooner with an especially commanding low range\xD1on the evidence of the few tracks he recorded, he had huge potential, but was the victim of a brutal murder in 1972 before he ever had a chance to truly blossom. Still, ""You've Got to Crawl to Me"" is a darkly funky tour de force, similar to something a pre-<i>Superfly</i> Curtis Mayfield might have cooked up.</p><p>
    Given the paltry promotion clout of a label like Bandit, it's easy to understand why none of these songs-- released with their crudely drawn yellow labels-- ever became a hit, but there's no doubt several of them could have with the right push. ""One More Time Around"" has an urgent bounce, with a great bassline, ultra-catchy backing vocals, a strange, almost David Axelrod-ish violin arrangement and impassioned lead vocals, possibly by Tridia Brown.</p><p>
    ""We Have Love"" is a scorching r&amp;b; ballad, while ""Doing it For Us"" puts the majestic in Majestic Arrows with a massive flute-and-strings intro, couching Larry Johnson's amazing vocal in a bed of Baldwin organ and velvety orchestration. The man responsible for the crazy string parts and fractured rhythms that open ""Love Is All I Need"", Benjamin Wright, later did arrangements for Michael Jackson's <i>Off the Wall</i>.</p><p>
    Brown actually attempted to make his son Altyrone Deno Brown into a sort of answer to Michael Jackson, recording his son at age seven belting a couple of monster soul tunes, ""Sweet Pea"" and ""If You Love Me"". The bottom line is that Brown's faith in his son's talent was not misplaced-- the kid sings his ass off-- but it may have been too early. As much as he really could sing, he sounds like you'd expect a seven-year old to sound, and his two songs on this compilation are really more useful for the sake of posterity (though not novelty, oddly enough) than for listening. The younger Brown did appear in several movies, including the Blues Brothers and won a Tony Award for his role in and off-Broadway musical version of A Raisin in the Sun, but when the Bandit label died in the early 80s and Arrow Brown's commune collapsed along with his health, he turned his back on show business and understandably gravitated toward a normal, stable life.</p><p>
    Though it ended ignominiously, the Bandit story is a truly fascinating one, an extraordinary validation of the theory that truth is a great deal stranger than fiction and the kind of thing that's naturally intriguing to record buffs. As reissues go, this is in line with the Numero Group's other releases to date: meticulously researched, lovingly compiled, painstakingly remastered (sometimes from vinyl, by the sound of it) and uncommonly focused, and that's a big part of its appeal to collectors as well-- it tells the whole story and pulls no punches. All that's left to do is listen.</p></div>"|2076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2076-eccentric-soul-the-bandit-label/|7.9|Joe Tangari

Maybe a rhythm could arise for a few seconds with a couple of thwacks here and there, and then there could be the violent, keyboard zigzags produced by fingers stuck in curious mouths. Perhaps, a renaissance in ""chance music"" could be realized.</p><p>
    
    Such fantasies came to mind when I sat listening to <em>Childish Music, and wondered what actual kids would think of it. Ekkehard Ehlers amassed this compilation of Japanese and European post-techno and folktronic artists whose work is deemed ""childish."" To his credit, Ehlers is a man of great courage and pluck in an art world often lost without a theory to explain it. He is best as a deconstructionist who has romance override any freeze-dried sterility that cynics stamp on conceptual electronic music, whether it is his homage to Albert Ayler and Robert Johnson or releasing his post-9/11 angst through a bass clarinet. His premises of having musical grownups act like non-musical kids earns a few brownie points, but the final product lacks key qualities of ""childishness."" I mean, where is the restlessness, the pretensions to being educational, and the playground-rhyme grossness?</em></p><p>
    
    Instead we mainly get melancholic ballads that yearn for simpler times as told by their acoustic guitar and music box melodies. This music is clearly for post-post-adolescent adults, as sad music would bore nearly every runt to crocodile tears. If anything, it's just another gentle, twee-electronic pop record, but sans the healthy discord of say, DAT Politics (who are strangely absent here) or the lysergic depth of Electric Company. The disc's cheesecake shot of a schoolgirl playing telephone with a turtle confirms what demographic this CD is marketed for. Still, a pleasant bafflement is amiss here. </p><p>
    
    Opener, Fan Club Orchestra's ""Mika Bubble Sing"" should have been <i>Childish</i>'s template. Some scamp tries to gargle a tune with a mouthful of water with Mouse on Martian tone tweakings, provoking some cheap thrills and an idea for a <i>Highlights</i> rainy day activity guide. The following Beach Boys/<i>Muppet Babies</i> pop of Maher Shahal Hash Baz's ""Good Morning"" keeps the faith, although my cavities ache from its sweetness. </p><p>
    
    Afterward, the compilation is divided into either digestible lullabies for post-toddler adults who need the whiff of Play-Doh or an animal cracker snack to give them reasons for living, or a peculiar translation of childhood memories into friendly, eight-headed beasts that come out from under the bed at night. </p><p>
    
    Harald ""Sack"" Ziegler's ""Ritterball"" is the clear standout: A French-sounding lad seemingly chats with the producer while a haunting, street march beat arises in the distance with a guitar clearing its throat from time to time. Nobukazu Takemura, who deftly exemplifies how ""childishness"" can be written by digital glitches, delivers ""Vibrante"" a rather ominous polka tune where a motherly Japanese lullaby assures that everything is fine while awkward melodies on the accordion and xylophone warn emit a ""the sky is falling!"" alert, that seems to be no lie. Folktronicist Oren Ambarchi's ""Creepy Crawl"" warps an electric guitar with a rickety, whammy bar and backwards-looped vocals speaking in tongue. Devendra Banhart's ""Make It Easier"" is a soothing, clap-along gospel grown from the root in cold ground, making me worry about the indifference that children might have toward something so meaningful. </p><p>
    
    But why did Matthew Herbert rock me to sleep-- causing me to wake up in four in the morning to wonder what socio-political subtexts about dissent against globalization that I missed? As Dr. Rockit, he executes "" Lullaby for William"" a lukewarm bossa novish lullaby all drenched in amniotic guitar tones and simple percussion that could be cracked U.S. Air Force rations recovered from an Afghan minefield. I mean, he once slightly charmed me with his house beats concocted from Starbucks cups and Big Mac wrappers-- what some could call an actual ""childish"" musical moment.</p></div>"|2085.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2085-childish-music/|6.9|Cameron Macdonald

Biram's debut album, I saw a dead possum lying square across the double yellow line. That image has stayed with me, so that every time I hear <em>The Dirty Old One Man Band</em>, I think of roadkill: gnarled viscera, bloody fur, flattened body. Obviously, this isn't high praise by any means, but the point of the comparison isn't to suggest that Biram's music is disgusting or lifeless. In fact, it suffers from a surplus of personality as Biram constructs a hillbilly stage persona by borrowing from Jon Spencer, R.L. Burnside, Jack White, Southern Culture on the Skids, Yosemite Sam, Tom Waits, the Reverend Horton Heat, and David Alan Grier's cameos on that Dionne Farris album. No, the point of the dead possum comparison is this: like that particular type of roadkill, Biram's mock-blues songs are Southern kitsch, their musical elements deep-fried and trucker-capped to the point of caricature.</p><p>
    
    Biram recorded <em>The Dirty Old One Man Band</em> on the fly, mixing live tracks with studio recordings and improvising songs he's road-tested over years of touring. Despite the added handclaps and tambourines, his approach is loose and immediate. However, Biram's not nearly as funny or as clever as he seems to think he is, a deficiency that is underscored by the off-the-cuff approach and that makes the album more tedious than entertaining. On ""Someday Baby"" he voices both sides of a conversation between his feisty lady (who gets the typical effeminate falsetto treatment) and his loutish, late-coming-home self (who gets the final word-- ""Shut up!"" which he repeats like a comic lamely milking a catchphrase). It's not really all that funny or weird, not here and definitely not on ""I See the Light/What's His Name?"" or ""Downtown Chicken"" or any of the other times he does it.</p><p>
<i>The Dirty Old One Man Band</i> blends a wide range of styles, from blues and rock to country and even a little bit of bluegrass now and then. Gospel and spirituals lie beyond his reach, but Biram proves a capable guitar player, generating forward-moving boogie-blues riffs and reveling in the cheap-amp distortion. The medley ""Throw a Boogie/Black Betty/Just a Little Bit"", recorded live at the Parlor in Austin, mixes up the songs as Biram's animated guitar threatens to wrestle free of his grip, and ""Truck Driver"" is a barreling stomp with extra horsepower from backing band the Weary Boys.

From their earliest flirtations with Elektra, Spoon were a dark horse in an industry that values the easily, tritely categorized; every album was a shift in sound, subtly tweaking prior formulas, distilling an already minimal sound into something even more distant. So far the refinement is evident, and they've followed success with even more success because, ratios aside, Spoon's intrinsic elements have never changed. Head-first, maximum R'n'B and tense, shuffling rhythms back Britt Daniel's unparalleled vocals and despite constant re-invention, Spoon remain, inimitably, Spoon.</p><p>
    
    Understandably then, <i>Gimme Fiction</i> succeeds for the same reasons, but that doesn't mean it's a step forward. Instead, Spoon return to more familiar territory-- some of which they haven't glimpsed since <i>Soft Effects</i> EP-- by pushing guitars back to the front occasionally, kicking out big 4/4 anthems, and leaning on some heavy rock piano to create a brooding, anxious album that's superficially more straightforward than anything they've done in years. For better or worse, <i>Kill the Moonlight</i> is a tough act to follow; after pushing their sound to its stripped-down limit, anything less than a further push into the frontier sounds like compromise, but, as Daniel howls on ""The Beast and Dragon, Adored"", ""If you believe, they call it rock and roll"". It all depends on your perspective.</p><p>
<i>Gimme Fiction</i> is actually a wildly diverse album, almost schizophrenic in its composition, vacillating between acoustic ballads, a bubbly, synth-tinged number (""They Never Got You""), handclaps, strings, and a whole lot of blue-eyed soul. It <i>feels</i> like rock action only because the album's finest moments-- for the most part-- are in the sublime climaxes of guitar-driven tunes, notably the heart-swelling, tambourine-ringing relief of ""Sister Jack"" or the beautifully spare ""I Summon You"". But calling them ""rock songs"" feels like an oversimplification: The term implies a simplicity that just isn't present even in the most direct offerings on <i>Gimme Fiction</i>. </p><p>
    
    ""The Two Sides of Monsieur Valentin"" illustrates an attention to the deeper, nuanced elements-- piano and cello flourishes run alongside the guitar chords and carry it to a stunning crescendo; the sheer volume of different <i>noises</i> at work underneath the melodies is enormous, and not one of them is out of place. The boys in Spoon have come a long way since the surefire blast of ""Car Radio"" (or even ""Jonathon Fisk"", for that matter), and even the most direct songs here have a precision craftsmanship rarely heard in something that is still, at heart, a rock album.</p><p>
    
    A rock album-- except for a single song that rejects that assertion completely, and is one of the most breathtaking songs Spoon has ever produced. ""I Turn My Camera On"" is a Prince-tastic masterpiece hearkening back to the Stones' ""Emotional Rescue"", but with a show-stopping grandeur that beats them both at their own game-- for one song, anyway; when it comes to soul, Britt Daniel has more in his larynx than Mick Jagger now has in his cold, lifeless body and the call-and-response between his backing chant and his own unbelievable, dual-layered falsetto proves it in barely three-and-a-half minutes. Spoon continue to refine and redefine their product, but rarely is the distinction between one adventurous standout and the rest of an album so marked. A smart band could build a career on the sound just tossed away in ""I Turn My Camera On""; in this case, I'd have settled for just one more song, but even if the alternative is business-as-usual for Spoon, that's still pretty great.</p></div>"|7430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7430-gimme-fiction/|7.9|Eric Carr

    at its laughably broad, sociologically pointed categories. Pop/Rock. Rap/r&amp;b.; Dance/Techno. This was the best
    they could do? There was a Punk endcap display (Daft Punk featured
    prominently) and, amazingly, two rows of DC Go-Go (my manager was a
    fan), but there was still much room for improvement. It is the
    privilege of the young to believe that simple solutions can solve
    complicated problems, and I decided to devise more accurate
    categories.</p><p>
    
    Complications immediately arose. Should Less Than Jake be filed under
    Ska, or Punk? Or Ska-Punk? Would I be allowed to make a section just
    labeled Crap? Cross-referencing was impossible; I was attempting a
    Gmail task in a Hotmail world. It is the privilege of the young to
    abandon any task that provides the slightest resistance, and I did
    just that. The Zincs take me back to that dilemma: Is <em>Dimmer</em>
    indie rock, alt.country, or neo-folk? Who knows? That's what the
    Pop/Rock category's for.</p><p>
<em>Dimmer</em> is the Zincs' sophomore LP, on which the formerly solo Jim
    Elkington finds himself with a permanent band including members of
    Fruit Bats and Euphone. It's a really solid record, unassuming yet
    memorable, subtle: It's mildly melancholy, modestly dark, and
    discreetly brooding. Its most striking feature is Elkington's voice, a
    wry bass vibrato wrapping around sardonic lyrics. ""Before I became a
    smoker, I used to sniff paint in my fathers shed/ With my passion for
    ingesting toxins, I felt by 13 that I'd be dead,"" Elkington deadpans
    over the ominous glissandos of ""Stay in Your Homes"". It would be
    pretty easy to mistake <em>Dimmer</em> for a Smog record.</p><p>
    
    But repeated listening reveals a deeper, more imbricate bed of
    influences. I'd never realized how similar Smog and J. Robbins can
    sound until I heard ""Breathe in the Disease"", an enticing dirge where
    smooth acoustic guitars vie against stabs of dark, messy chords, a
    subtle electronic haze floats over soundtrack strings, and Elkington's
    voice sits immovably in the eye of the quiet storm. Like the delicate
    minuet ""Bad Shepherds"", with its prickly Spanish guitar, ""Breathe in
    the Disease"" at once smacks of Smog and of Burning Airlines's
    smoldering slowburner ""The Surgeon's House"".</p><p>
    
    ""Beautiful Lawyers"", with its percussive acoustic strum, shushing
    electronic melody, and reverb embellishments, evokes the neat melodic
    turns found all over Yo La Tengo's <em>Summer Sun</em>, as do the
    folk-rock guitars and electro stutter of ""Moment is Now!"". The opening
    phrasing of ""New Thought"" seems an homage to Johnny Cash's ""Ring of
    Fire"", and the rail-riding ballad ""Passengers"" checks in with early
    Cohen and Donovan. The album's overall blend of rustic acoustica and
    subtle electro resonates with Dave Pajo or Windsor for the Derby, and
    by yoking all these far-flung stars into a new constellation, The
    Zincs achieve a distant shimmer that sounds old, feels new, and is
    distinctly their own.</p></div>"|8938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8938-dimmer/|7.5|Brian Howe

That approach suits The Robot Ate Me better than you'd think if you've heard the maniacally diverse <em>They Ate Themselves</em> or the experimentation of <em>On Vacation</em>-- and if you're a listener who chucked the first half of <em>On Vacation</em>, it's almost like this record was made with you in mind.</p><p>
    
    The instrumentation here is almost ordinary compared to The Robot Ate Me's previous work, with nearly every song played with acoustic guitar and muted horns. The band is stingy with its arrangements, bringing in the simplest bits of melody or rhythm only at the most necessary moments. ""Where Love Goes"" is a near-baroque guitar strum that drops everything for some evocative woodwinds, sounding as if someone snuck <em>Sketches of Spain</em> in with the band's Phil Elvrum records. The same is true of ""Lately"", which interrupts its sober gallop with a repeating horn figure that adds both rhythm and a bit of swing. The songs may not all be a barrel of fun, but many are hopeful: ""Bad Feelings"" hints at redemption even as it sings ""she's been feeling pretty bad about life,"" and the upbeat tracks are well-alternated between the darker meditations on love and regret, like with...""Regret"", a gentle folk song that declares, ""Regret won't change who you are/ Unless you take its lessons too far.""</p><p>
<em>Carousel Waltz</em> drives a pretty flat road, without the peaks and valleys of their previous work, but that suits the grounded emotions and realizations they're addressing, skirting the line between the unaffected and mundane. They teeter on the edge with lines ""I never thought that love was real until she came"" or ""Let's just love each other and hold on tight,"" but the tight arrangements coupled with Ryland Bouchard's creaking voice are consistently charming. <em>On Vacation</em> isn't quite what The Robot Ate Me made it out to be last year: We'd like it to be reckless and indulgent experimentation or nothing but brightly-colored Polaroid highlights, but we're more often left with a lot of time to kill to just sit around and think. <em>Carousel Waltz</em> is the product of just that, the summation of thinking long and hard about where you're headed, and it's a braver and more honest record than anything they've done to date.</p></div>"|6806.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6806-carousel-waltz/|7.8|Jason Crock

His four post-Fire Show mini-LPs were all stuffed with ideas and encrusted with analog sound-dust, emotion spilling from the collision of multiple strange sounds and simple yet alien arrangements. The last of these releases, <i>Am I Free?/I Am Free, is a sort of double-EP featuring two 20-minute, five-song discs in austere, silk-screened packaging that's meant to be the swan song of the Resplendent persona. Despite having generally the most traditional instrumentation of all of Resplendent's releases and focusing heavily on the acoustic guitar, it sounds no less deliciously alien or warped than its predecessors.</i></p>
<p>In his disarmingly honest liners, Lenzi lists six albums that he feels most influenced the proceedings: Neil Young's <i>After the Goldrush</i>, Notorious B.I.G.'s <i>Ready to Die</i>, Talking Heads' <i>More Songs About Buildings and Food</i>, Swervedriver's <i>Mezcal Head</i> and two Springsteen records, <i>Nebraska</i> and <i>The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle</i>. Honestly, it's not hard to hear how all of these things bubble under the surface of this music, even if none of the songs sound explicitly like any of them -- there's Young in the acoustic guitars, <i>Nebraska</i> in the bleakness, Biggie in the beats, Swervedriver in the shimmering washes of guitar-- though the way it's all mixed together defies easy categorization.</p>
<p>Both discs having stunning openers, <i>Am I Free</i>'s ""In My Quiet Car"" ranking with ""Judas Priest Cul de Sac"" as one of the greatest post-Fire Show Resplendent tracks. Lenzi's nasal croon hovers with flutes over a wall of acoustic guitar: ""Everything large and loud and bright will settle down/ The barking dogs and gusting winds will soon whimper and subside."" It sets the tone well for a record that feels like it's trying to come to grips with sorrow and cynicism in order to leave it behind, as though Lenzi wants the death of Resplendent to signal the laying to rest of his own anxieties. ""Dust of Luck"" leads off the second disc with a quick burst of shimmering Philip Glass-ish texture, but it's just a feint away from the meat of the song, a wash of astral country stuffed with multi-tracked acoustic strumming and searching slide guitar.</p>
<p>He goes for his trademark grab bag on the rest of disc two, flirting with electro-reggae on ""A Tourist No More,"" diving into glitchy anthemics on ""Beer Muscles"" and cultivating an avant-garde music box effect on the instrumental ""Hope"". The music has a dramatic sweep to it, but feels as though it's ready to come crashing down at any moment as drums stutter, guitars swerve off course and the tape reaches the saturation point. Lenzi is caught between vehement conviction and self-doubt on ""Destiny Afterbirth"", declaring ""this culture is bullshit"" with spitting authority but ending with the question ""momma did I do okay?/ Cuz nothing is like what you said it would be like.""</p>
<p>Those lines could very well be Lenzi pondering the Resplendent legacy, an output that would fit on two CDs if you squeezed it but that nonetheless covered a barely fathomable range of musical terrain. All of his releases since the Fire Show were produced in limited quantities and none received the attention they deserved, so it's hard not to wonder if there's any bitterness or regret hiding out in those lines. Then again, he also sings ""I won't waste another phrase on bitterness and sorrow/ I won't waste another day,"" so it could be that this is just a new beginning for an innovative, underappreciated musician. Let's hope so.</p></div>"|11818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11818-am-i-freei-am-free/|8.1|Joe Tangari

In the days of Brian Wilson and Burt Bacharach, it took a lot of planning to organize a number players and the studio clock kept going through all the mixing and tinkering. Now you can sit at home, record, layer, cut, and paste. Thing is, to do sophisticated arrangements and harmonic exploration correctly requires a certain amount of formal music training-- more than your average dude with a laptop has put in.</p><p>
    
    Nathan Michel studied composition at Princeton, so he has such a background. His first record for Tigerbeat6, <i>ABCDef</i> was typical of that label, heavy on noises that must have once seemed weird, light on recognizable patterns and repetition. To me it was good for a single listen, but Tigerbeat6 has put out so much in that vein that it must be connecting with somebody. On his second record Michel added vocals to his pieces; now, continuing his popward trajectory, his third album is heavily weighted toward conventional songs with vocals. <i>The Beast</i> isn't even an electronic record as such, as Michel records himself on guitar, drums, melodica, horns, reeds, keys, the list goes on.</p><p>
    
    For all its instrumental variety, <i>The Beast</i> sounds remarkably clean and balanced. Similar to Jim O'Rourke on <i>Eureka</i> and Stereolab since the late 90s, Michel's charts play down the bass and focus on subtle interplay in the midrange. Drums are mostly polite taps, while guitars and keyboards are given space to complete each other's sentences and congeal into clever chord progressions. It's the kind of music that sounds terrible loud but perfect at that level where it <em>just</em> fills the room with sound. Michel's even got a decent voice, especially compared to your average IDM guy who wants to give vocals a try. His singing on the title track is particularly strong, coming closer than anything else to the Beach Boys feel he obviously admires. The song's entwined nylon string guitars and various shakers evoke the island idyll High Llamas called ""Hawaii"".</p><p>
    
    Despite the sophista-pop proclivities, Michel hasn't left the Tbeat6 glitch world behind completely. The title track is pushed off course by the occasional intentional hiccup, a gentle reminder of the even acoustic music's ultimate digitalosity, but the carefully assembled mood endures. The drowsy piano ballad ""Status Dive"" contains similarly intriguing sonic tweaks, with odd intrusions of horns that seem to be peaking in from another record. Michel's voice keeps getting snagged on the hard drive in ""Suds"", lagging behind an upbeat tune that sounds like early, ""jazzy"" Chicago. Instrumentals like the buoyant technicolor calliope theme ""Planet"" are why the DAT Politics guys who founded Skipp wanted to be involved.</p><p>
    
    When I first heard <i>The Beast</i> I thought of Max Tundra, another one-man-band project who has evolved from his spazzy Tigerbeat6 days. Michel's music on <i>The Beast</i> doesn't have the thrill or unpredictability that Tundra brings, but Michel is tapping into a tradition that values a sense of control. <i>The Beast</i> isn't always exciting but it feels very complete, with that satisfying click of parts snapping into place.</p></div>"|5264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5264-the-beast/|7.6|Mark Richardson

Your best recourse is incendiary imagery better suited to a John Woo flick than a record review, and no one wants to read that shit (the Hot Snakes also make you want to swear a lot). It isn't ""talking"" music. Just the opposite-- it's a mandate to clam up, drive fast, bang the dashboard, stop thinking, smoke with the windows up, stay on the gas. Most rock bands in today's aggressively eclectic musical climate at least have the decency to tack on some random funny noises for the critic to latch on to, but the Snakes just aren't that considerate.</p><p>
    
    It's difficult enough to write about them when they have an album of new songs that are uncomplicatedly good and nearly identical to their last batch, but when they put out a 10-minute EP of four previously released tracks? Holy aphasia. Better stick to the facts: Last October, Hot Snakes flew to the BBC studios to record what would be John Peel's final session, one week before he died of a heart attack in Peru. Their Peel session consists of two songs from their debut, <em>Automatic Midnight</em>, and two from their latest LP, <em>Audit in Progress</em>, which sound like the album versions with a slightly rawer edge. Strangely absent are any tunes from their sophomore record, <em>Suicide Invoice</em>, which many regard as their finest.</p><p>
    
    While the EP doesn't reveal anything about Hot Snakes, it confirms their reputation as a remarkably vigorous live band. Their streamlined proto-punk is a more direct version of the style Rick Froberg and John Reis cemented with Drive Like Jehu, and radiates an unfettered urgency that's often missing from modern rock. There's a palpable sense of danger hanging around Froberg's aphoristic splatter, Gar Wood's concisely brutal bass, John Reis's searing, metallic leads, and Mario Rubalcaba's runaway percussion. ""Automatic Midnight"" is a blinkered dash over scorched riffage, Froberg alternately sneering apathetically and spitting rusty nails. ""No Hands"" rumbles over a laddering riff and pigsticking one-note leads, and standout track ""Braintrust"" slams a frantically gyrating rhythm into throttled riffs as Froberg intones one of his most menacing choruses. ""This Mystic Decade"" closes the EP with a more laidback melodic blast-- a concentrated burst of visceral pleasure.</p></div>"|3933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3933-peel-sessions-ep/|7.0|Brian Howe

After L.A.-based Pehr Records released their 2002 debut, <i>Red Your Blues</i>, Picastro inexplicably left the label. Refusing to step on any toes, the band remained tight-lipped about the affair despite claiming how awful the experience was. Singer/guitarist Elizabeth Hysen immaculately personifies this innocuous, victimized pathos, suffering from hyperaesthesia-- a sensory condition in which victims suffer from increased sensitivity to stimuli (think Daredevil).</p><p>
    
    Appropriately, <em>Metal Cares</em> exudes a sound seemingly tormented by sleep-deprivation, pain, and-- most pressingly-- fear. Hysen's vocals are much more prominent in the mix than on <em>Red Your Blues</em>, allowing her every grief-stricken crack and murmur to resonate above the equally tortured instrument parts. The track list serves as a peek into Hysen's neuroticism with titles like ""I Can't Fall Asleep"", ""Teeth and No Eyes"", and ""Sharks"", named after one of Hysen's foremost phobias. However, Hysen, a straightforward, no gimmicks songwriter, keeps the lyrics short and cryptic, not to mention unintelligible. On the chorus of ""Dramaman"", Hysen wails indecipherably amidst shrieking strings, while the ballad ""Sharks"" builds to a muffled chant sounding like ""bigger hunter, hello hunter"". Good luck trying to decode ""Ah Nyeh Nyeh.""</p><p>
    
    With her garbled drawl, Hysen could pass for a German laptop pop artist, though her bandmates' instrumental workings borrow the most from that genre. Rather than adopting the punchy, infectious folk-pop of past tourmates Cat Power or Smog, Picastro are content with allowing their songs to methodically unfold. Opener ""No Contest"" patiently unfurls on a cyclical acoustic riff for two minutes before finally revealing the song's subtle yet gorgeous refrain. Despite this asceticism, the album still contains several beautiful, striking moments between the gossamer acoustic strumming and haunting strings .</p><p>
    
    Hysen's hushed, sparing vocals leave a lot of open space between verses, but she's hardly twiddling her thumbs during that time. For all the allure Hysen's voice generates, her acoustic/electric interplay with guitarist Zak Hanna is the true glue that holds the LP together. ""I Can't Fall Asleep"" builds to a jarring chorus that features Hanna's reverb-drenched electric against Hysen's dissonant, ringing acoustic. Closer ""Blonde Fires"" puts a warmer, more inviting spin on this interplay, allowing the guitars to intermittently carry the lead melody. It's a sound awkwardly caught between Elliott Smith and Godspeed You! Black Emperor, balancing pretty acoustic melodies with chillingly shrill clangs and screeches. But hey, that's the unapologetic, enigmatic Hysen for ya; for all we know, part of her probably wants to be ""Miss Misery"", but the other half simply can't stop freaking out over sharks.</p></div>"|6570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6570-metal-cares/|7.5|Adam Moerder

The more prevalent kind is the fodder that fills a critic's mailbox, bands with awkward names and laser-printed cover art that don't inspire ire so much as pity.  The second group is more treacherous: Bands that yield high expectations due to past achievements, yet, for one reason or another, wipe out like ""The Wide World of Sports""' agony-of-defeat skier.</p><p>
    Often, these albums are bombarded with website tomatoes for reasons you can't necessarily hear through  speakers: the band changes their sound and image to court a new crossover audience, perhaps, or attempts a mid-career shift into ill-advised territory.  Or maybe they start writing songs about Moses in hip-hop slang.  But sometimes the bad album in question is none of the above; it doesn't offend anyone's delicate scene-politics sensibilities or try to rewrite a once-successful formula in unfortunate ways.  Sometimes an album is just awful.  <em>Make Believe is one of those albums.</em></p><p>
    Weezer have been given a lot of breaks in their second era-- both <i>The Green Album</i> and <i>Maladroit</i> were cut miles of slack despite consisting of little more than slightly above-average power-pop. The obvious reason for this lenience has to do with the mean age of rock critics, and the fact that most of these mid-20s scribes were at their absolute peak for bias-forming melodrama when <i>The Blue Album</i> and <i>Pinkerton</i> were released.  Even for someone like me, who came late to the Weezer appreciation club, it was impossible to hear these ""comeback"" albums without the echoes of the earlier alt-rock pillars ringing in our ears.</p><p>
    But now there's an antidote to that nostalgic interference.  Right from the start of <i>Make Believe</i>, when Weezer lurches into a flaccid take on Joan Jett's ""I Love Rock N' Roll"" with an unfathomably horrible speak/sing vocal from Rivers Cuomo (think ""I like girls who wear Abercrombie &amp; Fitch""), you can hear hundreds of critics mouthing ""no no no"" and going into crumpled shock.  What's more disconcerting is that the song gets <em>worse</em> over the course of its three minutes (let's just say ""Framptonesque voicebox solo"" and get back to repressing the memory)-- and it's the album's first single.</p><p>
    Hearing a song like ""We Are All on Drugs"", which nicks the classic melody of the schoolyard ""Diarrhea"" song (you know, ""when you're sliding into first..."" and so on) for an anti-drug message stiffer than Nancy Reagan's ""Diff'rent Strokes"" cameo, it calls into question whether <i>The Blue Album</i> was really that great, or whether it just stood out as a rare beacon of guitar pop in a grunge-obsessed era.  Trying to wrap your mind around the land-cliché-record lyrics of songs like ""My Best Friend"" and ""Haunt You Every Day"" leads me to wonder how <i>Pinkerton</i> could ever have seemed like such a cathartically resonant treatise on unrequited love.  Was Rivers Cuomo always on the notebook-scrawl level of ""I don't feel the joy/ I don't feel the pain,"" and did we not notice because scrawling in notebooks was the depth of our emotional knowledge at the time?</p><p>
    Okay, let's not be so hard on ourselves here: I'm pretty sure this is all Rivers' fault.  <i>Pinkerton</i> triumphed by being an uncomfortably honest self-portrait of Cuomo.  On <i>Make Believe</i>, his personality has vanished beneath layers of self-imposed universality, writing non-specific power ballads like he apprenticed with Diane Warren, and whoah-oh-ohing a whole lot in lieu of coming up with coherent or interesting thoughts.  Coupled with his continued obsession with tired power chords and bland riff-rock (surprisingly not sonically boosted by producer Rick Rubin, whose post-""99 Problems"" grip on relevance is now officially spent), the creative driving force behind the Weez is asleep at the wheel.</p><p>
    Considering Weezer supposedly went through hundreds of songs and several discarded albums to arrive at this final product, the laziness of this songwriting borders on the offensive.  Whether recycling dynamics from the band's back catalog (see: ""Perfect Situation"") or taking the easy Mother Goose rhyme (see: every fucking song here), these 12 tracks sound as if they were dashed off in an afternoon's work, maybe with Rubin holding the band at gunpoint.  The one half-decent song on the record, ""This Is Such a Pity"", fails to even maintain its status as a pleasant Cars homage, interjecting a guitar solo that sounds like it was cut from the original score to <i>Top Gun</i>.</p><p>
    So does <em>Make Believe completely ruin not just present-day Weezer, but retroactively, any enjoyment to be had from their earlier work?  I don't know-- I'm too scared to re-listen to those first two albums-- but it certainly appears that </em><em>Make Believe will expertly extract the last remaining good graces the critical community has to offer latter-day Weezer, unless my colleagues' memories of slow-dancing with Ashley to ""Say It Ain't So"" are more powerful than I can possibly imagine.  Of course, if Ashley went on to break your heart, fellow critic, </em><em>Make Believe might be just the medicine you need; put it on repeat and watch your emotional scar be obliterated as collateral damage in the torpedoing of Weezer's legacy.</em></p></div>"|8614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8614-make-believe/|0.4|Rob Mitchum

    see 
    Elvis Costello staring back from the 12-inch-by-12-inch black-and-white 
    LP 
    cover of King of America, looking much older than the young 
    rabble-rouser on 
    the cover of 1983's Punch the Clock. Instead of the enormous Buddy 
    Holly 
    specs that had been his trademark for years, he continues to sport a 
    pair of 
    understated wire-rimmed spectacles that-- along with that facial hair-- 
    lend 
    his visage a grave, almost academic air. Bedecked with an ornate crown 
    and 
    an embroidered jacket, he hides his recognizable features behind a 
    bushy 
    beard, and his weary eyes manage a wary look.</p><p>
    
    More surprises awaited eager listeners: On the spine, the artist was listed not as Elvis Costello and the Attractions, but, more puzzlingly, as the Costello Show. Similarly, the songs were credited to Declan Patrick Aloysius MacManus, the acoustic guitar parts to The Little Hands of Concrete. In fact, the name Elvis Costello was barely mentioned in the packaging at all, as if MacManus needed a vacation from his alter ego.</p><p>
    
    These oddities heralded an even more dramatic change within the vinyl grooves. <em>King of America was MacManus's first album without the Attractions since his debut (they appear on only one track, ""Suit of Lights""). Instead, through co-producer T-Bone Burnett, he had corralled a strong roster of impressively pedigreed studio musicians (he calls them ""my jazz and R&amp;B; heroes"" in the new liner notes) that includes Jim Keltner, Mitchell Froom, and Tom ""T-Bone"" Wolk, as well as Ron Tutt, Jerry Scheff, and James Burton from Elvis Presley's T.C.B. band. They lent the songs a professional albeit occasionally slick feel and helped MacManus realize his country and R&amp;B; ambitions.</em></p><p>
    
    What wasn't different, however, was the barbed wit and acid humor that infuse songs like ""Glitter Gulch"", ""Jack of All Parades"", and ""Brilliant Mistake"". Costello's career to this date is often idealized as perfectly angry-- Costello the scourge-- but it contains a very human number of mistakes and miscalculations committed, on his own admission, by a very confident artist and a very confused man. The 31-year-old singer's anger and outrage had been diluted with disappointment and experience: the band was in turmoil and on the verge of breaking up (and would after one more album); MacManus's marriage had recently ended; he had been playing innumerable live shows to counter legal woes; his previous album, <i>GoodBye Cruel World</i>, had been a flop (he refers to it as his worst). </p><p>
    
    The result of all this angst is a complex and conflicted album that, despite all the spit and polish, sounds lively and raucous. Intense romantic embitterment informs the wordplay of ""Lovable"", the willful caution in ""Poisoned Rose"", and the extended metaphor of ""Indoor Fireworks"", which is all the more devastating for MacManus's straight-faced delivery. Likewise, the idea of America-- his adopted homeland, if only temporarily-- simultaneously repulses and attracts him. On the powerful ""American Without Tears"", he compares his own loneliness and alienation with that of two World War II G.I. brides, as Jo-El Sonnier's accordion plays over the chorus.</p><p>
    
    Not knowing exactly what to do with such a bristly, ruminative album, Columbia Records unenthusiastically released the cover of ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" as the first single, then promptly forgot about <em>King of America, as did most listeners. A proper (and final) Elvis Costello and the Attractions album, <i>Blood &amp; Chocolate</i>, was released before the year was out (on which Costello credited himself as Napoleon Dynamite). Rykodisc unearthed <i>King of America</i> almost a decade later, and Rhino is reviving it two decades later as the final installment in its ambitious and generous reissue project. While many of the 21 bonus tracks-- including the A- and B-sides of ""The People's Limousine"" / ""They'll Never Take Her Love from Me"" by the Coward Brothers, Costello's side project with T-Bone Burnett-- were included on the Rykodisc version, the real finds on this edition are the seven live tracks from one of MacManus's few shows with the </em><em>King of America band. They fare respectably on the album track ""The Big Light"", but the band, especially guitarist Burton, blaze through covers by Waylon Jennings, Mose Allison, and Buddy Holly.</em></p><p>
<em>King of America may not have sounded like anything else Costello had done before, but it bears a striking, even disheartening, semblance to almost everything he's done since. In the ensuing years he has worked hard to excerpt himself from the British punk movement and to indulge his obsession with prepunk styles like classical (<i>The Juliet Letters</i>, <i>Il Sogno</i>), cocktail-lounge jazz (<i>North</i>), country (<i>The Delivery Man</i>), and Brill Building pop (<i>Painted From Memory</i>). This musical restlessness-- along with almost everything the middle-aged Costello has been criticized for, such as his practiced delivery, his overly calculated songwriting, and his obsession with backing musicians and collaborators-- has roots in </em><em>King of America, his first and finest assertion that he has a life apart from the Attractions. For many who were initially baffled by that cover image of MacManus, this album is the beginning of a long downfall; for others, it's merely Act II in a very long, very prolific career that is unusual for having so much buried treasure.</em></p></div>"|1626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1626-king-of-america/|8.7|Stephen M.

First established in the late 1990s by Tim Furnish-- a vet who has played with such scene stalwarts as Crain, the For Carnation, and Papa M-- Parlour's two previous albums were essentially glorified solo works, featuring tracks written by Furnish between the years 1996-2001 that relied heavily on atmospheric swells, drones, and textures derived from his laptop.</p><p>  The Parlour featured on <em>Hives Fives</em>, however, is one who has undergone an extensive and beneficial renovation. On these tracks-- recorded by Paul Oldham in December 2004-- the now full-fledged group has expanded to a seven-piece, together utilizing a substantially broader range of live instrumentation. These new additions, particularly the bass clarinet and saxophone work of Steve Good and Craig McClurkin, help to infuse and circulate enough fresh blood to animate every square inch of Furnish's compositions, resulting in Parlour's most vibrant and distinctive work to date.</p><p>  Bursting with layers of burbling analog keyboards, guitars, and locomotive drumming, <em>Hives Fives</em> could garner comparisons to Tortoise's <em>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</em>. Another significant point of reference is the seminal work of post-rock pioneers Pell Mell, whose lively, expansive melodicism is echoed strongly in Parlour's deft guitar and keyboard interchanges. Even so, on <em>Hives Fives</em> this extended version of the group make considerable advances in establishing a unique, recognizable identity that was sometimes lacking on Parlour's earlier releases.</p><p>  It certainly doesn't hurt that all four of these tracks come equipped with several massive melodic hooks, each able to shape-shift from one chorus to the next without the group breaking stride. On the introductory ""Such (A One Year Stem)"" dense synth and woodwind drones combine to lay down an absorbent carpet of moss beneath the competing volleys of chiming guitar and percolating drumbeats. The title track is a throbbing, lively, forward-looking piece of such sunny disposition that it almost resembles the soundtrack to an unusually adventurous industrial video, sounding as though it should be providing accompaniment to quick-cut footage of robots busy building jet engines or minting new pennies.</p><p>  ""Timorme"" coordinates puffs of narcotic clarinet and <em>Bitches Brew</em> keyboards before giving way to irregular, modernist guitar jangle, while the closing ""Bringseeds"" pushes things even further off-kilter, as pulsing electronic chords and drummer Joey Yates' jittery hopscotch rhythms eventually coalesce into muscular full-group riffing. About the only thing you can say against the songs of <em>Hives Fives</em> is that there are not more of them. This full-scale version of Parlour fairly begs for a more suitably epic expanse of terrain, and one can only hope that it's not long before we see this group able to truly stretch their legs.</p></div>"|6178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6178-hives-fives-ep/|7.3|Matthew Murphy

    damned. Their second U.S. release, 2003's <em>39 Minutes of Bliss (in
    an Otherwise Meaningless World)</em>, was among the most assiduous
    <em>Nuggets</em> rips of the neu-garage years, pillaging equal parts
    Sonics, 13th Floor Elevators, and ? and the Mysterians. To me (if
    not a certain website's archives), the strength of a few goofy, clever
    and undeniably catchy tracks-- ""Jerk It Out"", ""Sort It Out"", ""Let's
    Go Parking Baby""-- all but made up for the disc's unevenness.
    Authenticity? Dudes, Jack White never practiced in an
    honest-to-goodness Kennedy-era car hole, either.</p><p>
    Now the Swedes formerly known as 12 Caesars and Caesars Palace are
    back just in time to cash in on Apple's embrace of ""Jerk It Out"" for
    the company's ubiquitous iPod commercials. Aside from that track,
    which recurs on <em>Paper Tigers</em> as a bloated remix, the band's
    1960s fascination seems to have given way to a 70s power-pop fetish.
    Bits of Who bombast do seep into opener ""Spirit"", but fluffy jingles
    like ""May the Rain"" and ""Out There"" sound more like deservedly
    forgotten Romantics cuts. Alas, the power-pop Caesars aren't as fun as
    the garage-rock Caesars; rather than proclaiming a ludicrous desire to
    ""sniff glue/ 'Cause I can't get over you,"" they plunge into hackneyed
    lyrics-by-numbers about ""rivers of salty tears"" and not being able to
    ""go on without you"" even though ""my heart is strong.""</p><p> 
    Again, the band's backward-looking aesthetic doesn't bother me. But
    the bland, overproduced nothings of the Caesars' latest-- like those
    of fellow newfound power-poppers Tegan and Sara-- are cause for
    consternation. One of <em>Paper Tigers</em>' many whopping clichés,
    ""It's Not the Fall That Hurts"", is still catchy enough to match the
    stupid fun of <em>39 Minutes</em>' best moments. But the rest of the
    album is merely a blur of unimaginative song fragments layered with
    heavy echo and the remnants of the band's original guitar fuzz. I
    liked it better when they sounded like Smashmouth.</p><p>
    Wait, did I say ""triply""? I meant Tripoli. Nah, just kidding, here's
    the kicker: Even as the Caesars' best-known song is an icon of the
    iPod revolution, their new album is a throwback to the very business
    model that spawned Napster and its descendants. Yes: Like the
    multi-platinum '90s abominations that turned the biggest music lovers
    into the industry's most wanted, <em>Paper Tigers</em> is one or two
    decent singles surrounded by a bunch of mediocre-or-worse filler. Now
    <em>that's</em> retro.</p></div>"|1714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1714-paper-tigers/|4.9|Marc Hogan

His voice is a harsh, nasal, confused, emphatic bleat, clamping down on certain words and rolling tricky internal rhymes around in his mouth until they come out all broken. He sounds more like the sketchy drunk guy yelling in your ear at a show, asking if you know where to buy drugs, than like the frontman of the band onstage. Finn's voice may be difficult, but don't let it be a deal-breaker.</p><p>  Finn may not be Art Garfunkel up in this piece, but he uses his adenoidal rasp to blurt twisted, dense shards of squalid back-alley imagery and bruised druggy lamentations, broken teeth and broken bottles, and tattered hotel-room Bibles and hidden knives. He's the poet laureate of the loading dock behind the mall where the runaway kids get together to sniff cheap coke at 5 a.m.</p><p>  The Hold Steady's first album, last year's <em>...Almost Killed Me</em>, was a tangled mess of damaged character sketches and triumphant bar-rock thump-- <em>Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle</em> reimagined as an epic of Russian literature. But <em>Separation Sunday</em> is something more, the elegiac Biblical lost-innocence junkie odyssey that Denis Johnson never wrote.</p><p>  Like <em>Fiestas &amp; Fiascos</em>, the final album from Finn's former Minneapolis post-punk band Lifter Puller, it's an album-length story that forces us to pull bits of narrative from  Finn's tangles of words. In <em>Separation Sunday</em>, a confused Catholic girl named Hallelujah hooks up with a motley assortment of shady characters, does a gang of drugs, gets born again when some guy with a nitrous tank dunks her in a river, wakes up in a confession booth, and maybe dies and maybe comes back from death. But the real story is in Finn's virtuoso evocations of menace (""When they say great white sharks/ They mean the kind in big black cars/ When they say killer whales/ They mean they whaled on him till they killed him up in Penetration Park""), hedonism (""You came into the ER drinking gin from a jam jar/ And the nurse is making jokes about the ER being like an after-bar""), and brief shining moments of lucidity (""Youth services always find a way to get their bloody cross into your druggy little messed-up teenage life"").</p><p>  None of this would work if Finn didn't have an expert rock band backing him up. Finn's songs wheel precariously from one unhinged lyrical idea to the next, almost never stopping for choruses or going out of their way to fit into any sort of structure, but the band plays these songs like long-lost fist-in-the-air classic rock anthems. It's well-schooled in every bar-rock cliché, and executes these moves with joy and conviction: the pick-slide before the climax, the weeping Hammond organ on the bridge, the pregnant pause before the big riff kicks back in. Since <em>...Almost Killed Me</em>, the band has beefed up its sound with the help of Rocket From the Crypt producer Dave Gardner and keyboard player Franz Nickolay, and its Meat Loaf pianos, greasy George Thorogood blooz choogle, and wheedling Journey guitar carry more heft and authority than they had on the last album. This stuff would sound great behind just about any garage-rock hack, but it turns Finn's dirtbag chronicles into something epic and huge and molten and beautiful.</p><p> </p></div>"|3977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3977-separation-sunday/|8.7|Tom Breihan

Carnival is Mardi Gras-St. Patty's-Freaknik-Spring Break-Fuck Your Town Up After the Big Victory-madness. The national soccer team commands the pitch like the cast of <i>West Side Story</i>. Surfing, samba, white-sand beaches loaded with brown-skinned sex machines. And has anyone met an ugly Brazilian? How about a mopey one? Yeah, me neither. But if you read about the conditions in Rio's favelas-- Gestapo-y police tactics, unchecked drug trafficking, pre-teen death squads, and a mind-boggling homicide rate among people age 15-24-- poppin' that booty suddenly becomes a <i>Thriller</i> dance for the woefully begotten.</p><p>
    
    You're forgiven if you want to ignore socio-economics and just shake your dumper because that's the real aim here. As future U.N Deputy Secretary-General Lil' Jon stated in a recent interview, ""People just like to party. The economy is fucked up. There's war going on. People don't want to think about all of that shit. People want to relieve all of that stress and tension."" In a city where the haves frolic on beaches below the hillside shantytowns of the have-nots' <i>do morro</i>, the party is on full blast. It's Miami circa-'86 to the Extreme down there, kids, and there are no big record contracts to save anyone from the slum.</p><p>
    
    The prevailing sound of favela funk is the 808 bass. It's the basis of every song, so if you don't like it, don't bother. Some tunes color it with traditional instrumentation like the accordion-tinged ""Pavaroty"" or the horn blasts of ""Bate La Palme De Mao"", but for the most part, samples and synth flashes are just window dressing for the low end. One noticeable exception is ""Jonathan II"" which has the Mario Bros. freaking the keys like Wendy and Lisa with a kid hard-spitting Portuguese rhymes. By ""kid"", I mean a 9-year-old, and it doesn't sound like he's riffing on Iesha or at the playground, you know? He sounds pissed, which places him neatly within the oeuvre of favela mc'ing, in which the ability to sound menacing supersedes all other qualities. The most amusing example occurs on ""Toma Juizo"" when the soft-voiced member of the duo conspicuously gravels his vocal during the chorus to match the gruff of his partner. </p><p>
    
    Most of <i>Favela Booty Beats</i>' cuts are pleasant renderings of 80s Miami bass if taken separately, but the dated and relatively tame selection robs the music of its all-out party intentions. Diplo's <i>Favela On Blast</i> mix approximated the vibe, and various online mp3 mixtapes are google-fresh. In comparison, <i>RBF: FBB</i> (like that?) feels like a Pier 1 Import of ghetto world music.</p><p>
    
    With American hip-hop stomping its Goliath footprints in the world's urban ghettos throughout the last decade--  and with increasingly diverse offspring in Europe and Africa-- favela funk may be the most startling descendant. Seizing on the nihilism of gangsta rap and the escapism of Southern bass, it is a disquieting manifestation of a truly desperate faction of Brazilian society. With all that is broken in the segregated narco-slums of Rio, Sao Paolo, and the rest of Brazil's metropolises, the favelados are making the most unhinged club music on the planet. Hopefully, future compilations will better translate the feeling.</p></div>"|2084.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2084-rio-baile-funk-favela-booty-beats/|7.2|Peter Macia

Take the ""Collage of Digital Passion"": This German trio's cutup piece could briefly cause a few eyes to blink at the hi-fi during a cocktail party or soothe a heart-broken and Nyquil-drunk soul bathed in bedroom TV glare. The ""passion"" comes from the snippets of uttered ""love"" samples that flicker in the rhythm of a bored man's remote control; a loop of a crushed-velvet R&amp;B; ladykiller carries the piece with a ""love"" that sings to every straggler who comes in the lounge for bitters. The sauntering micro-funkiness of it all could remind one of a dazed Prefuse 73 or, for the obscurists, the acid-damaged collage of the United States of America's ""The American Way of Love"".</p><p>
    Yet, the liner notes of <i>Lost Recordings</i> inform us that the ""Digital Passion"" was actually a trailer soundtrack for a special on ""sexuality and romance in digital postmodernism"" on the science TV show called ""Adventure Research"". My BS detector rings a happy song when the notes then mentioned the track had an ""aphrodisiac effect"" that apparently mutated the show's recording session into something ""akin to a sexual orgy."" Unfortunately, the Exposures' ""secret"" incident was kept in the studio vault, so we get a ""toned down"" version of what happened through our stereos or a ""vague idea of the composition's true impact."" Fair enough. What this has to do with deconstructed semantics, image, and power or whatever this week's definition of postmodernism is-- I'll get back to you on that when there is time and money.</p><p>
    The Exposures are best remembered for being credited as a ""fictitious backing band"" on microhouse snake charmer Jan Jelinek's 2003 sleeper, <i>La Nouvelle Pauverte</i>. Whether Jelinek saved or robbed them is unclear: Conflicting reports tell us that he shined the light on these 25-plus year veterans by inviting them to perform on that record, while the liner notes on the group's <i>Lost Recordings</i>-- which compiles their obscure pieces from the past four years\xD1claim Jelinek sampled their shimmering wah-wah guitar without permission for his ""Ifs ands &amp; Buts"". Hell, judging by the songs here, The Exposures could really be Jelinek himself in b-boy drag.</p><p>
    Confusion aside, Scott ""Prefuse 73/Savath + Savlas/Delarosa and Asaora/Piano Overlord"" Herren is giving the Exposures their dues through his Eastern Development label. The German trio of M. Cretu, N. Gratin, and O. Grouton originally came out of an experiment in German television sometime in the late 70s. A station tried to amuse viewers with short movies between shows, instead of the usual commercial filler. They eventually spent the next two decades soundtracking films and TV shows. The results are instrumentals that take a good, digestible jazz-hop idea and loop it for three minutes with a few chord progressions to deliver the goods before they expire. The best is ""Post Crossings"", with its octopus-limbed synth riff that sounds mechanical yet oddly lyrical.</p><p>
    ""A Machine Under Influence"" (apparently recorded live at a Volkswagen plant) is nearly as strong with its clove-smoked jazz that walks in a circle as a UFO toy beeper grows in volume and madness before cutting off. ""Sake Rock"" sounds like a distant subway ring that duets with a guitarist struggling to hit the right notes with it, while ""The Knack"" (done for a documentary about some guy who pedal-boated across the Atlantic) has a swank jazz strut that breaks its bones with every added note and snap of the sampler. ""Das Freundliche Rocksichord"" and ""Ein Lied für Frau Thyssen-Henne"" are both Polaroid snapshots of cool jazz and bossa nova grooves all bathed in a weariness aged with time and listlessness.</p><p>
    Overall, there are so many peculiar sounds and historical contexts in <i>Lost Recordings</i> that a cult could very well arise around the Exposures. Yet, something tells me that there is a man behind the curtain that could surprise or disappoint many if it was opened. I mean, ""Post Crossings"" apparently grooved a TV exposé on cycle racing that sparked public outrage, a moment that the liner notes acclaim is the handiwork of ""sensational journalism, accompanied by an equally sensational band."" Do you hear a detector ringing?</p></div>"|2923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2923-lost-recordings-2000-04/|7.1|Cameron Macdonald

    and Berkeley, California's Themselves, marking the place where two
    parallel lines veer inward and converge to the sound of swelling
    strings and distant drumclaps. It has been a long wait. One year ago,
    Themselves's diabolically cerebral Doseone whet my appetite for this
    project in an interview: ""Those guys are just like us,"" he said of the
    Notwist. ""Totally collaborative and focused.""</p><p>
    
    It's true; symmetries abound: Both groups released jaw-dropping albums
    in 2002 and followed them with several years of remixes and other
    projects, leaving the challenges they heralded unanswered. For the
    Notwist, it was <em>Neon Golden</em>, a splendid wash of immaculate
    electro-pop that was broadly adored. For Themselves, it was the <em>The
    No Music</em>, a stunted mutant of grinding robot-rap that was hard to
    love but easy to regard with awe for its huge ambition and relentless
    brutality. If the former was a sonic approximation of
    melancholy-tinged <em>joie de vivre</em>-- a delicate, fluttering thing-- the latter was an iron tank smashing everything in
    its path under its treads.</p><p>
    
    Upon hearing of this unlikely alliance, fans could only speculate. How
    would Themselves's Futurist evocations of claustrophobic din, fascist
    visions, and post-industrial blight dovetail with the pastel hues of
    the Notwist's spacious laptop pop? Would integration even be possible,
    or would the process be more mash-up than collaboration-- Doseone
    gibbering maniacally and sawing sheet metal over big, lazy arcs of
    guitar? How can a butterfly collaborate with a machine? This
    improbability must be why 13 &amp; God's debut is such a creeper, an album
    of broad gestures that reveal vivid, flickering details over time, its
    pleasures unfolding as what it actually is gradually erases
    speculative notions of what it might be.</p><p>
    
    Two of the album's most immediately pleasureable songs also happen to
    be its most unabashedly ""Notwisty""-- single ""Men of Station"" and ""Perfect Speed"" wouldn't be out of place on <i>Neon Golden</i>. On those tracks, Themselves seem to be in lurker mode-- their most
    discernible contribution to ""Men of Station"" amounts to creepo
    nursery-school harmonies. But mostly it's Markus Acher's show-- quivering strings, a lambent piano phrase, an acoustic arpeggio and
    gently spitting drums create an austere foundation for his voice, as
    he repeats the phrase, ""We are men of station/ We are troubled and
    just the same/ But we're not as hell as you.""</p><p>
    
    Exactly why Acher's voice is so penetrating and resonant, despite
    being, on the surface, rather plain and unaffected, is difficult to
    nail down-- something about the way he holds simple syllables in his
    mouth, then releases them with the slightly skewed and careful
    inflections of a non-native speaker, renders them unspeakably
    magnetic. He brings this same understated grace to the hushed burner
    ""Perfect Speed"". Here, an oscillating buzz sharply contrasts
    ping-ponging chords in a staticky slither where false endings blur
    into mellow sirens into dramatic re-entries, drums flogging the track
    restlessly around tight corners.</p><p>
    
    The remainder of the album achieves a more realized synthesis of
    styles, and the stridency of <em>The No Music</em> is nowhere to be
    found. The members of Themselves also comprise one half of Subtle,
    which is as lush and sonorous as Themselves is cacophonous and stark,
    and 13 &amp; God makes more sense when appraised as a collaboration
    between the Notwist and members of Subtle than as a Notwist/Themselves
    production. Keyboardist Dax Pierson (who remains hospitalized after
    Subtle's van crash in February) joined Themselves after the release of
    <em>The No Music</em>, and perhaps he's partially responsible for
    softening the ever-mercurial group's aesthetic.</p><p>
    
    ""Afterclap"", for instance, with its breezy sing-along vocals, nearly
    atonal woodwinds, and loopy whistles, is unlike anything the Notwist
    or Themselves has ever produced. It's vintage g-funk gone twee,
    as if Dre hooked up with Nate Dogg's cardie-wearing cousin to make a song for
    suburban cruising in a Honda hatchback with factory speakers. ""Low
    Heaven"" is a seething, pneumatic wheezer tricked out with Themselves's
    nightmare chorus and Dose's patented multi-tracked muttering, but
    remains airy and light. ""Soft Atlas"" strings deliberately chiming keys
    over a vanishing pulse, setting the stage for Dose's most hypnotic and
    ramified vocal turn this side of the propulsive drone-hop of ""Tin
    Strong"", where he competes with Acher's chopped-up falsetto. ""Walk""
    closes the record with a metamorphosing sound collage, which works
    well in this concise dosage and embodies what I imagined 13 &amp; God
    would sound like overall. But after spending many hours wandering the
    elegant and diversely adorned chambers of its other songs, I'm glad
    that I was wrong.</p></div>"|8288.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8288-13-god/|8.1|Brian Howe

Despite their best rebuttals (""We're Christians in a band, not a Christian band!""), the tag's stuck, and after nine studio albums, what's it matter anymore? Frontman Jason Martin must've been one of those precocious Sunday schoolers who looked past the bake sales and finger painting to realize how depressing Bible stories actually can  be. His slick yet downcast shoegazer ditties have established the group's spirituality as more in step with ""Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"" than ""Jesus Loves Me"", a pathos critical in distinguishing Starflyer from more popular, albeit extinct, bible-thumping rockers (R.I.P. Jars of Clay, Creed).</p><p>
    
    After a misguided attempt to revive their mid-90s classic rock sound on <i>I Am the Portuguese Blues</i>, the band finds a more appropriate medium to project their soporific melancholia. <i>Talking Voice vs. Singing Voice</i> picks up where 2003's <i>Old</i> left off, mixing <i>Bossanova</i>-era Pixies surf guitar with breathy, Nyquil-induced vocals and, despite whittling down to a mere two members, the band produces their biggest sounding album to date. <i>Old</i>'s discreet violin parts expand to grandiose string ensembles on <i>Talking Voice</i> while fluffy production dulls Starflyer's staple lo-fi, sharp-edged guitar sound.</p><p>
    
    Always the New Order aficionado, Martin fully realizes his love for 80's electro-pop on songs like ""The Contest Completed"" and ""Good Sons"". We're not talking Killers-style new wave pandering here, just some playful synth tinkering and a few electronic drumbeats where gritty garage instruments used to be. One of the few uptempo moments on the album, ""Good Sons"" spontaneously combusts after a downtrodden verse, flashing sugary synth leads and a potpourri of drum machine blips reminiscent of ""Bizarre Love Triangle"". While not as fun, religiously charged closer ""The Longest Line"" mashes strings, guitars, synths and drum loops into one multi-layered pulp, sounding part-Duran Duran, part-Billy Graham with lyrics like ""Got one destination/ For Jesus to call me home"".</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately a return to the sound of <i>Old</i> also means a return to Starflyer's Radiohead imitation, which more accurately sounds like an imitation of Hood's Radiohead mimicry. Martin's lyrics aren't interesting enough to warrant acoustic elegies like ""Softness, Goodness"" and ""A Good Living"", and he deploys hackneyed religious lyrics where Thom Yorke would launch an anti-Bush philippic. Sure, they overestimate their modest songwriting's allure, and yeah, Martin's vocals are perpetually set to an unflappable, emotionless ""coo"". Still, after nine diverse albums, these guys consistently churn out solid sleepy-eyed, mid-tempo indie rock, which helps make the sentimental spirituality easier to stomach.</p></div>"|7464.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7464-talking-voice-vs-singing-voice/|7.2|Adam Moerder

Before      giving way to a Pink Panther-style bassline and some patently brilliant      vocal sampling, the bubbling 10-second prelude to 2004's most      accomplished hip-hop disc doesn't sound like hip-hop at all. The blippy pulse kind      of sounds like static from some interplanetary radio station. It kind      of sounds like Four Tet, who proves to be quite the unconventional rap      producer on his tag team effort with that cagey masked marauder MF Doom.</p>
<p>Originally slated to drop last summer soon after the release of      <i>Madvillainy</i>, these remix EPs were delayed at first due to creative feeling-out      and nitpicking. Both Doom and Madlib wanted to tweak a couple of the      remixes and-- thanks to their famously-hectic schedules-- the wait      inevitably snowballed. After a botched test pressing, the songs finally broke      free recently, albeit only on iTunes (due to contractual fine-print,      these mixes will only get a physical release in Europe on wax). Still, the      downtime has its benefits: With more distance between the originals and      the new mixes, it's easier to consider these tracks on their own, and      they'll inevitably have you going back to the source with a refreshed,      slightly skewed perspective.</p>
<p>Four Tet mastermind Kieran Hebden may not be the most obvious choice to      take on such classic material but, based on his six-song collection,      he's an inspired pick. Although psych-scratching Stone Thrower Koushik      would seem like a more suitable candidate on paper, it's Hebden's      far-reaching reimaginings (""remix"" doesn't quite do these painstaking tracks      justice) that truly impress. Employing his trademark free-jazz-inspired,      electro-acoustic patterns, the laptop guru amasses small armies of      saxophone squawks and looping synths all marching to some of the hardest      drums he's ever programmed. Ever the sonic neat-freak, Hebden somehow      tames his cacophonies and makes everything bump like a batch of      Interstellar Coltrane-approved boom-bap.</p>
<p>Though best known for his laid-back Volvo-ad-ready beat-suites,      Hebden's always had traces of Shadow-esque hip-hop soaked into his background      fabrics. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that Hebden was a big      Madvillain supporter early on. Nearly a year before <i>Madvillainy</i>'s official      release, he was praising retarded hard copies in a self-penned Pitchfork      Artist List: ""MF Doom also has a record coming out with Madlib soon,""      he wrote in May 2003, ""[it's] so good I pretty much shit my pants every      time I hear it.""</p>
<p>The guy's Doom obsession obviously borders on near-stalker levels, and      his familiarity with Madlib's original thunder proves invaluable.      Hebden's focused instrumentals strip away any and all sonic traces of Lib's      ashed-out, quick-fix soul, but they match the West Coast beatminer's      unflappable adventurousness. Paired with Doom's jigsaw narratives, Hebden      doesn't necessarily improve upon the original tracks as much as he      offers a     supplemental shade of depth to a much-loved masterwork.</p>
<p>Both physically and stylistically, Hebden and Doom make an odd couple      ripe with ""hilarious"" buddy-cop potential. In the passenger seat sits a      hunched-over laptop guru who's known to perform with a glowing Banzai      tree next to his console, and driving the wheel (and chomping the      donuts, of course) is Doom's most-blunted, beer-bellied dictionary-snob.</p>
<p>The free-form mood is set from the beginning as opener ""Meat Grinder""      twitches and spurts for a good 30 seconds of utter randomness. A lazy      clarinet surfaces at one point. Cut up saxophones share their confusion      with pulsating factory noises. Then Hebden cracks the beat and acts as      pied piper to the aural odds and ends, which quickly fall in line and      suddenly make total sense. It's like a Magic Eye poster for the ears.      ""Money Folder"" gets the banger treatment, drums train-clacking across the      speakers over a sinister synth line. And, of course, Hebden takes full      advantage of Doom's ""old jazz standard"" break invitation, setting off      an entire Ornette Coleman symphony. The most intriguing track is ""Great      Day,"" where the producer translates Madlib's lackadaisical stroll into      a brooding patchwork of whizzing acoustic guitar effects that gently      bend against the beat's downtempo grain. Lines like ""It's easy as Pi,      three point one four/ One more one false move and they done for,"" take on      a new gloomy resonance as the track turns Doom's peculiar boasts into      those of a sullen bully with a conscience.</p>
<p>Psychedelic mish-mash DJ Koushik's eight-track EP runs just under 10      minutes long, staying true to Madvillain's haphazard punk-rock pace. He      goes lengths to emulate <i>Madvillainy</i>'s canny blend of      comic-book-inspired dialogue (Dr. Doom creator Stan Lee pops in, pontificating in his      unmistakable growl, ""You can not be arrested for wanting to conquer the      world-and that's all that Doom wants."") and loose, soulful loops. Flutes      float in and out of ""Strange Ways"" and cooing back-ups help ""Curls""      find a decent groove, but most tracks fly by at such a quick clip, they      hardly leave an impression. More of a logical continuation than a total      revamp, Koushik's EP is competent, but doesn't add anything new to Doom      and Lib's wily formula, ultimately reading like an      engaging-but-kinda-empty Cliff's Notes version.</p>
<p>Since he's working with everyone from Danger Mouse to Ghostface      nowadays, is it too early to propose a full-fledged DoomTet long player? Then      he can move onto a DualDisc collabo with Animal Collective and Will      Oldham.

    full band since his days fronting Soul Coughing. It's also his first LP of original 
    material since signing to ATO records (part of label owner Dave 
    Matthews' earnest attempt at a monopoly on round-headed white guys who sing 
    like muppets). Doughty's recent solo work has been mostly acoustic 
    singer/songwriter stuff, but <em>Haughty Melodic</em> isn't so intimate-- picture 
    last year's re-released <em>Skittish</em> backed by the Dave Matthews 
    band, and you'll have a good idea of what this record sounds like. It's 
    full of jam-band percussion, vanilla-funk basslines, and the occasional 
    strings and horns, played with an affected worldliness that nearly 
    erases all of Doughty's idiosyncrasies.</p><p>
    
    If you're searching the tracklist for hints of Doughty's quirky humor, 
    ""Busting Up a Starbucks"" isn't quite satire, just the smug finger-pointing 
    title and some name-checking, along with lyrics like ""This bitter 
    drink/ Has got you drunk/ The thoughts you think/ Become unthunk"". ""Tremendous 
    Brunettes"" features Dave Matthews himself in a jaunty duet about being 
    surrounded by women and unable to get laid-- something I'm sure to which
    Matthews, one of the highest-paid singers in the country, can relate.</p><p>
    
     
    ""Starbucks"" is an old song to Doughty and his fans, featured on his 
    <em>Smofe + Smang</em> live record from 2002-- as were others such as ""Madeline 
    and Nine"". However, you have to dig through the impenetrable 
    harmlessness of the instrumentation to discover the melancholy lyrics of 
    ""Sunken-Eyed Girl"" or ""Grey Ghost"" and hear what makes them worthwhile. While 
    these older songs get closer to the heart of Doughty's circular, rhythmic 
    guitar playing and unique phrasing, the mediocre adult-contempo 
    melodies on ""Looking at the World From a Bottom of a Well"" or ""Unsingable 
    Name"" aren't much of a payoff.</p><p>
    
    But I keep coming back to the sparse, sincere ""White Lexus"", with lyrics 
    about disowning the thrill of riding in a luxury car-- or the thrill of 
    seeing who's driving it, alleviating his isolation-- over some acoustic 
    strumming and a bit of pedal steel guitar. It's here that Doughty hits 
    a real note of yearning, revealing an ordinary desire and the 
    complicated reasons for hiding it. Not coincidentally, this is the record's most 
    minimalist moment. The problem here isn't that Doughty 
    isn't as malleable (or faceless) as artists like Matthews; his material sinks or swims on his personality, with 
    light-hearted wit or disarming personal candor. <em>Haughty Melodic</em> is 
    lacking in both. Doughty is better off when laid bare or with a group of 
    musicians that push him in new directions, rather than ones who simply back him.</p></div>"|2591.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2591-haughty-melodic/|5.5|Jason Crock

    rectum weirds you out, just skip to today's American Music Club review
    or whatever lap-pop record we just placed in Best New Music. Bergen's
    Datarock are about as dick-in-ass as it gets-- gayer than Guided By
    Voices, maybe even gayer than the Boo Radleys.</p><p>
    And the best part is I don't even think these dudes fuck! One-time
    Annie-collaborating Fredrik Saroea, according to the band's site, has
    a girlfriend (relax, it's not Annie), and Ketil Mosnes, the other guy,
    ""is single but chances are big he is either too drunk or in a bad
    mood."" Whatever, Saroea writes all the lyrics, and chances are big
    I've made all this stuff up anyway. The point is that gay disco--
    which is what this fabulous duo pump out with strong accents of
    Madchester-via-Röyksopp, Sparks, and the Talking Heads-- continues to
    become aestheticized and genrefied, an autonomous vocabulary of licks
    and entendres entirely divorced from the sexual proclivities of the
    artist. Brown licenses are public property-- all your gays are belong
    to us.</p><p>
    The challenge: Are Datarock kitsch? Are they campy like Scissor
    Sisters? How do Datarock want to be received with lyrics like ""Get on
    my hands and knees/ On your command I'll freeze"" or songs like
    ""Nightflight to Uranus"", where ""Uranus"" is ""your anus"" and the rest is
    all ""We're gonna give and then we'll receive"" sorta stuff? Are they
    funny ha ha, or <i>Funny Ha Ha</i>? Reception's everything, sure fine
    okay, and musically the songs pack enough jabs for all you ""I don't
    listen to lyrics"" and ""I only like hip-hop for dancing"" types. But
    just something as quick as that Boney M flip above, or the twisted
    call-and-response on ""Computer Camp Love"" -- Datarock must know
    they're working within and challenging a genre to some extent, so I
    don't think it's fair to say all their cock talk is for knee jerks or
    without greater motivation.</p><p>
    Enough snorkling though, I need to tell you about these really awesome
    songs-- all total energy thing, with at least two or three solid
    curveball hooks amidst the feet fodder. Datarock jump around a bit
    stylistically, borrowing David Byrne's affectations, his band's
    jingle-jangle guitar lines even more so. That said, Datarock scrap
    together an identity across the album with (a) the aforementioned
    art-gayness and (b) live drums over drum machine production, with the
    balance leaning closer to the synthier side of things even on the
    album's rougher Sloppy Mondays moments, like the massive romp ""I Used
    To Dance With My Daddy"". Datarock have a song that riffs off of
    Maybelline cosmetics (""Maybe she's born with it"") with the amount of
    space !!! went after with varying success on <i>Louden Up Now</i>, and
    ""Laurie"" could pass for one of those lap-rock songs we might get from
    one of those Plus/Minus type bands, (except it's actually good).
    There's never a bottom line with bands like this, but the bottom line
    with Datarock is the songs shoot for instant pleasure and accidentally
    end up being much more than that. Sorta how mom and dad ended up with
    five kids.</p></div>"|2606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2606-datarock-datarock/|7.8|Nick Sylvester

The rhythms of African traditional music and the storytelling craft of traveling griots-- relatives of the early bluesmen-- form a huge part of the ancestral basis for jazz, blues, and, by extension, rock'n'roll, reggae, and all of their modern counterparts. The modern world is a cultural vortex, sweeping disparate strands into new forms, and in the 20th century all of the musical descendants of Africa's rhythmic past-- originally spread through scattered Diaspora by the slave trade-- came flooding back to Africa cross-pollinated with European compositional traditions. In the wake of independence, many young musicians felt the need to break free from the styles their parents had danced to and invent something of their own. It was the 1960s, and ample inspiration flowed in on vinyl from the West, as did instruments, amplifiers, and recording equipment.</p><p>
    
    Psychedelia, soul, and funk are words we use to broadly describe music, but they're almost intentionally open-ended-- and all three were global phenomena in the 1960s and 70s. African musicians reared on highlife and Cuban rhumba considered them as a unified palette, drawing freely from each as well as their own traditions to create the styles we know today-- Afrobeat, mbalax, soukous, benga, mbaqanga, and so on. The variety of sounds is staggering, and most of it is still waiting to be discovered outside of Africa. With such a huge amount of music and so little means of hearing it, we have to turn to compilations to help us find our way into it and thankfully the range of choices is currently growing steadily.</p><p>
    
    The latest chance to get your feet wet comes courtesy of David Byrne's Luaka Bop label, in the third installment of their excellent <i>World Psychedelic Classics</i> series and the first to feature a range of artists rather than focusing on just one. <i>Love's a Real Thing</i> draws from across West Africa, focusing on the thrilling juncture of Africa's musical history where experimentation was the rule and Africa, unbeknownst to most Westerners, experienced its own psychedelic era, complete with attendant social upheaval, flared pants, fluorescent colors, odd hairdos, and generation gap. The songs here run a good gamut from the relatively conservative Afro-Cuban groove of No. 1 de No. 1 (the name presumably means ""best of the best"") to the flailing, heavy acid-funk of Ofo the Black Company.</p><p>
    
    The disc starts with a single smack of a snare drum, which sets Orchestra Poly-Rhythmo de Cotonou Dahomey's ""Minsato Le, Mi Dayihome"" off and running with snaking guitars and jerking rhythms. Benin's best musical export are credited here without the ""T.P."" prefix they usually affixed to their name, an acronym for ""tout pouissant,"" French for ""all-mighty"" and not at all a misnomer. Unlike most Afropop compilations, which tend to focus on one country or a specific sound, this one revels in veering back and forth between Anglo and Francophone countries, tossing heavy funk in with British Invasion-tinged soul and conga-heavy neo-traditional psych in an intentional display of stylistic breadth.</p><p>
    
    They've dug up some real gems, too, such as the title track, by Gambia's Super Eagles, a ripping soul/Britpop song full of sinewy guitar lines and dueling lead vocalists. Moussa Doumbia's ""Keleya"" takes the organ-heavy sound of the Malian hotel bands and throttles it with a gruff vocal attack, while Sorry Bamba's ""Porry"" is a brilliant, spacious Saharan riff on Cuban son, swimming in organ and stately Andalusian horns. Cameroon's Manu Dibango is an African funk superstar, but the track they've chosen here, the closing theme to his soundtrack for the Senegalese film Ceddo, is an odd, inspired choice, surrounding traditional African marimba with a slow funk burn for an ultimately majestic instrumental. Nigerian William Onyeabor's ""Better Change Your Mind"" is a synth-slathered prog-funk killer whose title refers not to changing an opinion so much as an entire mindset, reaching for a decidedly flower power-ish ideal of international harmony and cooperation.</p><p>
    
    Even with all the variety, there's not a weak selection here, nor anything that feels out of place. A glorious eclecticism is one of the defining characteristics of African popular music in its 1970s golden era, so it's entirely appropriate for a compilation like this to turn on a dime with every track. Beyond that, this offers plenty of other accoutrements like informative liner notes and a multimedia video for ""Minsato Le, Mi Dayihome"", not to mention the fact that only two of these songs are currently in print anywhere else. Simply put, this is a fantastic introduction to a broad range of vintage West African sounds, and one that's likely to please both devoted followers of African music and curiosity-seekers alike.</p></div>"|2083.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2083-world-psychedelic-classics-3-loves-a-real-thing-the-funky-fuzzy-sounds-of-west-africa/|8.5|Joe Tangari

They've recorded some
    of the most excitingly innovative British pop of the past decade, and
    yet their sound is also instantly familiar: heir to the Beach Boys'
    endless California summers and the Beatles' <em>Magical Mystery
    Tour</em>-era psychedelia, prone to Orbital-like electronica eruptions,
    and as musically omnivorous as David Bowie. The 'Fork archives are
    littered with encomia to these Welshmen's greatness.</p><p>
    As we suspected all along, their influences sound mighty nice, too.
    The Super Furries' installment in DMC's <em>Under the Influence</em>
    series-- previously curated by the likes of Morrissey, Paul Weller,
    and Ian Brown-- reflects the band's sprawling
    landscape of sonic reference. The obvious suspects (the Beach Boys,
    Electric Light Orchestra) make appearances, but they're surrounded by
    funk, house, dancehall and, gulp, opera. In the wake of similar
    compilations like Grandaddy's <em>Below the Radio</em>, <em>The Trip</em> and <i>Back to Mine</i>
    series, and Optimo's <em>How to Kill the DJ [Part Two]</em>-- not to mention <i>Now! That's What I Call Music</i>-- SFA's picks
    bolster the case that the iPod age hasn't killed the mixtape, after
    all.</p><p>
    Several tracks should be required listening: Sly and the Family
    Stone's ""Family Affair"", MC5's ""Kick Out the Jams"", and of course, the
    Beach Boys' shimmering ""Feel Flows"", originally from 1971's
    then-underrated <em>Surf's Up</em>. However, this compilation also
    boasts a memorable rarity or two. For instance, it includes to my
    knowledge the first CD release (aside from a 2003, similarly
    SFA-culled <em>Mojo</em> comp) of Dennis Wilson's lush 1970 B-side
    ""Lady"".</p><p>
    The band's five members each contribute three selections to the
    effort, adding to the disc's diversity. Singer Gruff Rhys turns in
    some of the superest, furriest choices, representing Wales with the
    skewed, Left Banke-like chamber-pop of the Gorky's Zygotic Minci
    stalker ballad ""Christina"" and some minimalist Welsh-language synth-rock
    by Datblygu that wouldn't be out of place on Rhys's recent solo album.
    Drummer Dafydd Ieuan turns in ELO's mini-epic ""Telephone Line"", which
    is practically an SFA template. Predictably, keyboardist Cian Ciárán
    is responsible for a couple of electronic club-thumpers, Humanoid's
    ""Stakker Humanoid"" and Joey Beltram's ""Energy Flash"". But he also
    throws in the disc's classical number, Bizet's ""Pearl Fishers"".
    Underworld's ""Rez"", which beeps almost exactly like my girlfriend's
    alarm clock, was one of Ieuan's picks.</p><p>
    It promises to be a Super Furry year: A singles compilation and Rhys's
    solo album came out (how do you say ""dropped"" in Welsh?) earlier in
    2005, several of the band's finest records have just been reissued,
    and a new full-length is on the way. It remains to be seen where the
    Super Furries, now more than a decade old, intend to go next. This
    <em>Under the Influence</em> set underscores where the band has come
    from, and it's a wonderful world.</p></div>"|7606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7606-under-the-influence/|7.4|Marc Hogan

In 2015, a compilation of their highlights will be worth buying. In 2005, their albums really aren't, unless you have a big place in your heart for Bob Wratten's super-fey indie pop and that place wasn't already filled by his work with Field Mice.</p><p>
    
    It should be noted that everything on this album sounds nice; it's well-recorded, well-mixed, well-performed-- hell, it's even well-packaged-- but it has little spark and a bad habit of insisting on five-minute songs. Wratten and friends make listening a chore with crawling, dull songs like ""One Prayer Answere"", a drag with cello, acoustic guitar and sleepy, barely melodic vocals. There are a lot of songs here like this, and I'd say they formed the backbone of this album, if this album had any backbone at all.</p><p>
    
    Like I said earlier, the highlights are quite bright, but there are just a few of them in the offing and outside of these sparkling moments, it's strictly bedtime. It took me a few listens to realize that ""Last Port of Call"" is a pretty nice song, surrounded as it is by its drag-ass cousins, but its laid-back lilt and memorable melody make it stand out-- even if it is twice as long as it should be. ""Helen Reddy"" gets things started with a sweet fake-out, sweeping along at a swift tempo with the sweet vocals of a bandmember credited only as Beth leading the way-- it almost reminds me of Pale Saints, actually, and it got me excited for what was to follow. I should have known better, because Wratten pulled this exact trick on the last TBS album, <i>Alive to Every Smile</i>, leading off with a stunner only to retreat to somnambulant quietude on the rest of the disc.</p><p>
    
    ""The Sea Is So Quiet"" also picks up the pace and is similarly rewarding-- Wratten's melodies aren't exactly hook-laden, so sometimes it takes a snappy drum beat and some chorused guitar to drive them home, which is the case here. Two of the four songs tacked on after the album's proper running order (it's telling that they're referred to as ""extra tracks"" and not ""bonus tracks"") seem to realize this, but by then, the album's runtime has bloated to an arduous 75 minutes. These songs all feel like they should burst and go somewhere, but none of them do. Even a sense of economy-- say, allowing no song to last more than the two or three minutes-- could have improved this, but by the time I get a third of the way through, all I want to do is stop listening to it. Wait 'til 2015.</p></div>"|8149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8149-the-seven-autumn-flowers/|5.5|Joe Tangari

Wha-ha-ha were a originally a trio formed by saxophonist Akira Sakata (who gets around, playing recently with Jim O'Rourke), and over time, featuring some of the best jazz players in Japan. They never released any studio records outside of Japan, but in 1984, Chris Cutler (Henry Cow, Art Bears) released a compilation of their music on his ReR imprint, and the band found a modest following among RIO and avant-prog fans in the West.</p><p>
    However, Cutler's ""rock in opposition"" tag doesn't really begin to describe what they sounded like: I hear bits of jazz and fusion, placed alongside goofy cartoon voices, dub production, primitive computer music, new wave, and what would work very well as the soundtrack to <em>Star Blazers</em>. It sounds as if the whole ""lineage"" of Western pop only ever happened as a jumbled, nonsensical arrangement of events, with no attention paid to their order or significance. <em>Shinutokiwa Betsu</em> was Wha-ha-ha's first record, and has been reissued by Columbia Japan (you can get it via Forced Exposure, along with their second album). Longtime fans of Japanese experimental music will recognize Sakata, though drummer Shuichi ""Ponta"" Murakami has played with most of the biggest names in Japanese jazz and keyboard player Chino Shuichi played with Otomo Yoshihide-- not to mention guest percussionist Kiyohiko Senba, leader of the excellent Haniwa All-Stars.</p><p>
    Wha-ha-ha's rhythm-heavy (or more accurately, jittery pulse-heavy) approach is best heard on tracks like ""On the Floor"", with the vocalist known only as Mishio providing a scat-operatic, wordless melody under a quick, ska-inflected beat and frenetic piano asides from Chino. And it really does sound like a typical Saturday morning in my house, circa 1984. ""Inanaki"" begins with a an ominous, anticipatory synth patter before launching into some seriously spaced-out speed-wave, like the ""Star Trek"" theme gone manic disco. And really, we all have our paths in life to follow, but I sincerely hope yours includes the ""Star Trek"" theme gone disco.</p><p>
    ""My Happiness (Is Not Yours)"" trades ""Star Trek"" for a documentary on how hydrogen atoms bond at the Atomic Café, or some such concept so over-the-top silly/nerdy that it demands my undivided attention. Everything happens so quickly, and with such precision, you'd be forgiven for missing the little details, like Sakata's distant, discordant sax solos in between verses, or the silent break in the middle, when the band stops down to catch its collective breath until Sakata screams a command at them, and they jump right back into the ""bop-ba-ba!"" refrain. ""Kohmori"" is calmer, and sounds to me at times like mood music for a Japanese cocktail lounge, interspersed with more active forays into calypso-jazz-royal fanfares and soprano a cappella ""ah-ah-ahhhh"".</p><p>
    Wha-ha-ha released three albums in total, the third of which hasn't been reissued yet. Fans of more later Japanese bands like Harpy, After Dinner, or the jazzier parts of Japanophile John Zorn's Naked City should get a kick out of <em>Shinutokiwa Betsu</em>, though it's lighthearted in a way Naked City never was. Still, I imagine this record stands out today just as much as it did in 1981-- ultimately, eccentric cartoon music is its own reward.</p></div>"|8786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8786-shinutokiwa-betsu/|7.9|Dominique Leone

An increasing number of indie bands appear to be absorbing the channel-hopping, micro-editing, multitasking pace of our ADD generation, flitting amongst styles and sounds like a middle-schooler tries out different cultural identities. As opposed to the genre-casserole cookbooks that glutted the late 90s in the long shadow of one Beck Hansen, this trend seems to be more about keeping the peas, chicken alfredo, and biscuit strictly sequestered on different parts of the plate, while still packing them all into a single track. Borrowing the love of segues and multi-part suites from prog while leaving behind (most of) the muso wank, this branch of indie rock seems to be fighting its complacency with complexity, replacing calculated non-chalance with giddy ambition.</p><p>  Last year's flag-wavers for this trend were the Fiery Furnaces, whose <em>Blueberry Boat</em> revived the untapped ""A Quick One While He's Away"" story-song format for a surprisingly divisive audience. Though the Furnaces don't seem willing to relinquish their leadership role-- what with stacks of new material all set to be released in the coming year-- the hot prospect on the scene just might be Architecture in Helsinki, an eight-member Australian outfit bursting with the same ecstatic impatience and pretentious-pop charm. It pains my soul to so tightly tether a band's image to that of another, but AiH utilize a very similar approach to making music (if in tighter, briefer packages than the Furnaces), and will likely provoke reactions along the same love-it-or-loathe-it battle lines.</p><p>  Where Architecture in Helsinki hold an advantage, however, is in sheer size, with eight members contributing on a Santa-long list of instruments, producing a sound like a third-grade music class let loose in a music instrument warehouse. Most of the band's members also contribute vocals to <em>In Case We Die</em>, creating a vocal spectrum to match the instrumental diversity: off-tune twee, standard-issue indie-boy/girl croon, congregational harmonies, all-male military choral chants. These elements give Architecture in Helsinki multiple palette combinations to try, and to their credit, <em>In Case We Die</em> tries as many as humanly possible in 12 tracks and 40 minutes.</p><p>  Take the title track, which (of course!) contains a parenthetical ""parts 1-4"" on the listing. Part 1 opens with electronic shimmers reminiscent of their smaller-canvas debut, <em>Fingers Crossed</em>, but surfeited with random percussion including rather Smile-esque saws and hammers. Shift suddenly to Part 2, where strings and horns flare briefly before giving way to a Stringman solo. Part 3 contains a rather Arcade Fire unison-chorus vocal, complete with field recordings of a fireworks show. And Part 4 eases us back down with a minute of indie slow-dance, complete with angelic backing singers and what sounds like a French horn solo. Oh, did I mention all this takes place in 3:33?</p><p>  Architecture in Helsinki's unwillingness to decide what kind of band they are is their most endearing quality, forcing them through multiple metamorphoses within each song-- like ""The Fly"" in fast-forward. At the core, one could probably most easily pound them into the square hole of twee-pop, but I haven't heard too many twee bands so convinced that they can pull off a spastic dance segment (""Nevereverdid""), or make a two-minute symphony about math (""It's 5!""), or effortlessly build a song from a simple electro beat to a brassy peak Beulah would be jealous of-- and, oh yeah, use some sitar and psychedelic a capella while they're at it (""Do the Whirlwind""). What passes for straightforward, in songs like ""The Cemetery"" and ""Wishbone"" is still delivered at three-espresso pace, with enough mic-swapping and instrument-switching to make me imagine their live show looks like an Olympic event.</p><p>  OK, I could spend another 600 words just diagramming the various twists and turns within the shockingly short boundaries of <em>In Case We Die</em>, but it's a lot better to listen than to read. All the same, don't be surprised if you experience a little dizziness, or a little frustration, as every catchy melody on this disc (and there are dozens) tends to arrive and depart faster than a subway train. Armed with more ideas than should probably be legal, Architecture in Helsinki can't be bothered to dwell for too long on any one of them, and it's this fickle nature that will make you either adore them or deplore them.</p><p> </p></div>"|441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/441-in-case-we-die/|8.8|Rob Mitchum

    Even for Adams' most zealous fans, hunting down new material has never been a particularly pressing concern: The two-disc <i>Cold Roses</i> is one of (a vaguely audacious) three full-length releases planned for 2005 (<i>Jacksonville City Nights</i> is slated to arrive this summer, with <i>29</i> expected in the fall), and while Adams has never been an especially sharp judge of his own work, <i>Cold Roses</i> suffers considerably from its double-disc conceit. Overstuffed and vaguely monotonous, the album could be easily whittled down to a single sequence of impressive songs; Instead, it's a meandering, occasionally moving series of mid-tempo laments, some more memorable than others.</p><p>
    
    Despite ample backing by the Cardinals (guitarists J.P. Bowersock and Cindy Cashdollar, drummer Brad Pemberton, and bassist Catherine Popper; with singer-songwriter Rachael Yamagata, formerly of Chicago's Bumpus, taking guest turns on ""Cold Roses"" and ""Let It Ride""), <i>Cold Roses</i> doesn't feel particularly collaborative; followers of Adams' solo work will recognize loads of parallels to Adams' post-Whiskeytown, 2000 solo debut, <i>Heartbreaker</i> (minus the punk throwdowns).</p><p>
<i>Cold Roses</i>' most palpable reference point may be <i>American Beauty</i>-era Grateful Dead: Excellent opener ""Magnolia Mountain"" mixes slow, ""Box of Rain"" melancholy (""If the morning don't come/ Will you lie to me?/ Will you take me to your bed and lay me down?"") with Adams' trademark guitar scrapes and sandpapered howls, while ""Cold Roses"" is packed with giddy guitar noodling and jam-friendly interludes (even Adams' vocals seem deliberately Garcia-infused, straining and paper-thin, careening off into a smoke-filled sunset.) Meanwhile, nearly every bit of electric guitar on <i>Cold Roses</i> sounds as though it was plucked straight from Dick's vault, all wiggly solos and playful licks, unintentional and woozy.</p><p>
    
    Lead single ""Let It Ride"" bounces, proudly shuffling through a laundry-list of country requirements: whining steel guitar, longing mentions of Tennessee and Carolina, nods to the Cumberland River and ferryboats, big, lonesome wails. But ""Let It Ride"" also employs plenty of weird, Ennio Morricone-inspired western guitar whirls, and Adams' coaxing vocals are undeniable, charmingly sincere and innocent: The resulting song is properly engaging, more classic country than alt-anything.</p><p>
    
    ""Cherry Lane"" employs honky-tonk yawping and girl-gone words (""The glass/ It hits the floor"" is accompanied by requisite glass-shattering sound effects), while the preciously titled ""How Do You Keep Love Alive"" mopes along, wearied and oddly pretty, half-sung over a languishing piano line. Adams' songwriting proclivities have always flirted with MOR, adult-alternative sappiness, but for the most part, <i>Cold Roses</i> is clever and uncommonly listenable, far less bombastic and contrived than its predecessor. Even lyrically, Adams is modest and cautiously confessional, careful to avoid the cocky caterwauling that invades much of his back catalogue. </p><p>
    
    Tellingly, <i>Cold Roses </i>is the first Ryan Adams record not to feature a picture of him on the cover; it's increasingly difficult to say exactly when Adams transitioned from bloated media darling to scrappy underdog, but it happened, and he commandeered the passage all by himself, squirming away from the overblown antics of yesteryear and embracing, instead, the staid earnestness of his roots. It's a welcome return. </p></div>"|42.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/42-cold-roses/|7.2|Amanda Petrusich

Pink's second album, <i>Worn Copy</i>, furthers his cult-baiting mystique as a bedroom hermit from suburban L.A. who conjures up ghosts by burning a roll of avocado-green shag carpet un-vacuumed for 30 years.</p><p>
    
    To his credit, Pink has sharpened his songwriting and studio touches-- he has several 1970s AOR-pop Muzak formulas nailed, making his freakitude compelling and digestible. That's a quality Ween and Redd Kross sometimes failed to capture-- quotation marks were clearly and fashionably marked on their odes to that decade's trash culture. But the problem remains that if the fashionably shoddy production values are removed from the sound, Pink's music would melt into the air.</p><p>
    
    Still, <i>Worn Copy</i>'s first half is a gas. Opener ""Trepanated Earth"" begins with a hazy, synth and flanged guitar. Pink then mumbles something romantic before one of his split personalities interrupts, ""The human race is a pile of dogshit!"" and ""Mankind is a Nazi!"" After a few false starts and jumbled rickets, he then becomes a charming easy-listening opening act for the Wings 75 tour. ""Immune to Emotion"" is nasally congested ""I'm OK, You're OK"" pop that could serve as country club luncheon entertainment. ""Jules Lost His Jewels"" is a 33rpm power-pop raveup cranked or ""Alvin-ized"" (as composer John Oswald might put it) to 45 with bloodlines that can be traced to the Mothers of Invention's ""Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance"".</p><p>
    
    Pink's most poignant moments come when his low-fi smoke screen dissipates. ""Credit"" is a clever, disco-spiced lament that smokes its second pack of cigarettes over credit card policies and bills-- the mundane subject matter made so bizarre yet sensible for the inflation-addled 70s. ""Life in L.A."" is a fine downer-rock number with a languid mood that mimics the exhaustion of watching the sunset over a beach while you're trapped in a traffic jam on a freeway bridge.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>Worn Copy</i> indulges in too many half-realized noise experiments and ideas. ""Bloody! (Bagonia's)"" is Pink amusing himself with Tourette's syndrome, while the quasi-rap number ""Cable Access Follies"" earns a silver star for imitating Beck at his most confusing.</p><p>
    
    By the way, did you know that this year marks the 10th anniversary of Mike Watt's sleeper-hit ""Against the 70s""? It's the tune where the legendary postpunk bassist has Eddie ""Crazy Horse disciple"" Vedder sing, ""The kids of today must defend themselves against the 70's!"" The key lyric goes: ""It's not reality/ It's someone else's sentimentality.""</p></div>"|6554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6554-worn-copy/|5.9|Cameron Macdonald

    and Excepter have recently transformed NYC's premature <i>No New York</i> Jr.
    hype machine into something genuinely exciting. But, turned-off by blindsided Big
    Apple-centrism, I could just as easily tag Vienna, Oslo, or
    the San Francisco Bay area as the key musical centers in my own personal
    cosmology. Right now, perhaps even more than those locations, I'd consider Tampere, Helsinki,
    and Turku, Finland the most fertile breeding
    ground for today's refreshing noises.</p><p>
    Lucky for stateside consumers, Finnish hype means once
    impossible-to-locate releases are trickling-down to North American
    labels. I've listened to dozens of eccentric, beautiful Finnish albums and one of the best is Lau Nau's debut, <i>Kuutarha</i>, the work of
    20-something Laura Naukkarinen. She's also a member and/or participant
    of Finnish ensembles Avarus, the Anaksimandros, Kiila, Kemialliset
    Ystävät, and Päivänsäde and most recently one-third of Hertta
    Lussuässä with Merja Kokkonen (aka Islaja) and Jonna Karanka (aka
    Kuupuu). Unlike these communal projects, she mostly goes it alone here,
    joined on a few tracks by Pekko Käppi on jouhikko (a fiddle played on
    the knee), Tomas Regan on acoustic bass and banjo, and Antti Tolvi
    on flutes, kantele, chimes, and mandolin.</p><p>
    Fittingly, <i>Kuutarha</i> was originally a small
    edition, self-released and long out-of-print CD-R with handmade packaging that included
    painted sleeves, twigs/branches. Playing it regularly for months, it's
    become familiar enough that I find it difficult to explain, like if
    someone asked me to state in clear, declarative prose my smallest,
    subconscious habits.</p><p>
    Focus could be placed on her astute experimentation but just as important
    is Naukkarinen as a scruffily polished singer/songwriter,
    one unafraid to trip between airy lullabies, eerie rambles, and
    Angus Maclise fireside jams. She digs deep into the musical toolbox,
    using (and I quote), acoustic bass, bass recorder, five-stringed
    kantele, acoustic guitar, tenor recorder, violin, bamboo flute,
    colorful juice glasses, mortar, mandolin, witch laugh megaphone,
    baby's rattle, bike bells, banjo, cowbells, electric guitar, organ,
    willow whistle, tablas, percussion, cymbals, comb, and beer cans to
    add to her blooming abstract folk milieu. Whether
    ""Johdattaja-Joleen""'s Avarus-style Django Reinhardt gypsy swing or the
    Henry Flynt embossed ""Kivi murenee jolla kävelee"", Naukkarinen manages
    to take a million-and-one risks while keeping things subtle,
    understated, aesthetically intriguing, and emotionally resonant.</p><p>
    Naukkarinen sings in Finnish, so for non-speakers, lyrics will likely remain
    another hard-to-pin-down element. She provided me with English
    translations, though, and it turns out her use of language is just as
    nimble as her instrumentation. Opener "" Jos minulla olisi"" (""If I
    had""), nails silvan spiritualism: ""If I had a religion/ It would be
    a living creature/ One couldn't raise/ With any force or labour.""
    ""Pläkkikanteletar"" echos Wallace Stevens' ""Thirteen Ways of Looking
    at a Blackbird"" (""Five crows/ On a rainy asphalt/ Fly on great wings/ Through
    our window"") and ""Tulkaa!""'s insect bells, background swells,
    plucking, and singing saw contribute to a <i>Leaves of Grass</i> vocal
    invocation: ""Come kites!/ Come mosques!/ Come chaffinchs!/ Wise
    fellows of the forest!""</p><p>
<i>Kuutarha</i> isn't perfect, but it gels
    and works perfectly in its own ineffable way-- its spare, haunted,
    almost silent acoustic ambiance comes off like a Vashti Bunyan
    madrigal broken into tiny parts then rewoven with grass to create a
    new, wraithlike mosaic openly defying the original time-based
    narrative, and replacing it with an experimental drift just as
    cohesive as its original, pristine format.</p></div>"|4984.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4984-kuutarha/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

    just wanted to explore new hi-fi recording techniques by experimenting on 
    other people's guinea pigs."" In 
    the wake of Guided By Voices' dissolution-- and the band's increased spotlight after 2003's <i>Easy 
    Listening</i>-- it's difficult not to read that as a copout. Still, if you're in the mood for some glam-rock fun, 
    <em>Copycat Killers</em> picks a diverse set of songs and pushes the 
    band's sound into new territory.</p><p>
    
    Like many covers albums, there's some inspired reinterpretations, some 
    predictable retreads of the band's influences, and some duds. The 
    Rolling Stones' ""Play With Fire"" is a stunning surprise, transformed into a 
    beatnik drum circle and injected with Nick Cave-level creepiness. It's 
    the pop songs that raise eyebrows the highest, however, and not just for 
    token kicks: Pink's ""Get the Party Started"" ducks the obvious rock 
    potential for a stoned monster-mash shuffle (if that heavily-reverbed cough 
    in the beginning doesn't get the point across, changing the words to 
    ""we'll be burning roaches you'll be kissing my ass"" quashes that last bit 
    of subtlety). Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"" is the last song I 
    expected the band to cover, and while the drums gallop a 
    little harder, they stay reasonably close to the source material. 
    Elsewhere, Hawkwind's ""Urban Guerilla"" gets the Motown treatment, and the 
    Fall's ""Dice Man"" becomes the soundtrack to a chase sequence from ""Hee 
    Haw.""</p><p>
    
    The later songs on <i>Copycat Killers</i> are less thrilling: The 
    experimentation they bring to the pop tracks they cover is absent from songs closer to their style by the Troggs, Mott the Hoople, or, er, Leonard Cohen. 
    Kicking some dust onto classics like ""Teenage Kicks"" would be preferable to 
    the anemic by-the-numbers delivery here. Whether it's conscious or not, Cobra Verde send the 
    message that the established rockers that influenced them directly are 
    untouchable grails and pop/dance material is open to manipulation, and less 
    worthy of reverence. Their take on ""Temptation"", which reduces New 
    Order's electronic waves of bliss to a few acapella ""doot doo's"", proves 
    otherwise (Is anyone in a band reading? Please, please, please, for the 
    love of all that is holy, stop covering ""Temptation."" The original is 
    note-perfect, and any attempts to diverge or get cute are just going to 
    fall flat. Just ask Moby). But give Cobra Verde credit where it's due 
    for pushing their boundaries on what easily could have been a tossed-off 
    filler record-- and for having big record collections.</p></div>"|1728.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1728-copycat-killers/|7.1|Jason Crock

On their follow-up, <i>Celebration Castle</i>, the group has updated its crib-sheet's timeline to further include moody 80s post-punk, drawing references to Joy Division, Sonic Youth c. <i>Evol</i>, and the propulsive jangle of early R.E.M.</p><p>
    
    As with all great garage rock bands, however, the Ponys perform their shameless pillaging with such dexterity and stylish swagger that they've virtually rendered themselves immune to accusations of unoriginality. Whether or not any of their ideas are actually new feels irrelevant, and the only pertinent questions to ask regarding <i>Celebration Castle</i> are does the band make these borrowed sounds their own, and does it sound good? To which the only possible answers must be, respectively, without question and shit yeah.</p><p>
    
    Produced by Steve Albini, <i>Celebration Castle</i> is one of the cleanest and often straight-up prettiest-sounding albums from the In the Red label. Having toured almost constantly throughout 2004, the Ponys' playing here is taut and immaculately cohesive, and appropriately the album sports an engaging live-in-the-studio production.</p><p>
    
    Leading off with ""Glass Conversation"", a chiming guitar duel whose hypnotic soar nearly recalls classic Savage Republic, <i>Celebration Castle</i> works quickly through an impeccable set of songs with few excess moves. As on their debut, the oddly affected, semi-British vocals of singer-guitarist Jered Gummere continue to evoke those of Richard Hell, and here the group makes more judicious use of Farfisa, using it to provide strategic atmosphere as they make frequent use of additional guitars. This approach is particularly effective on tracks like the vibrantly melodic ""Another Wound,"" or the pulsing, atmospheric ""We Shot the World"", a song whose central riff persistently threatens to morph into ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" without actually managing to do so.</p><p>
    
    Other highlights include ""She's Broken"", which features an impressively forceful vocal turn from bassist Melissa Elias, and the closing ""Ferocious"", a consistently electrifying track that essentially serves as a concise summary of all things good in rock, especially as its primal thump gradually gives way a gorgeous sprawl of overdriven guitar. As with all of <i>Celebration Castle</i>'s best moments, it's a performance spell-binding enough to have even the grouchiest garage connoisseur ready to forgive the Ponys their every trespass.</p></div>"|6539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6539-celebration-castle/|7.8|Matthew Murphy

They either drown their vocals in noise and render them ""just another instrument,"" saving their imagination for new daisy chains of effects pedals (see Labradford, Flying Saucer Attack) or they spend time on lyrics and make albums that may as well be filed under spoken word (latter-day Lou Reed and Leonard Cohen). If your voice is such that the mathematical possibilities of melodic variation are exhausted in four bars, the last thing you want to do is make music in a style where the tune is usually the focus.</p><p>
    
    This ill-advised third path is where German duo Tarwater treads on their fifth album, <i>The Needle Was Travelling
    </i>. Eleven of the 14 tracks here are mid-tempo and musically reminiscent of 80s synthpop (updated with modern technology, of course), a genre with a rich history of hummable tunes. Unfortunately, vocalist Ronald Lippok (also of To Rococo Rot) is physically incapable of singing anything of the sort. The songs coming from his dour, uninflected voice-- which is constantly doubled to fill out the mix-- could be played on a keyboard by an armless dude with a pencil in his mouth. Even when Tarwater manage to get something cool going instrumentally (which happens occasionally), the vocals squash the life out of the track.</p><p>
    
    Exception: ""Jackie"", a fine little tune carried by the lovely melodica that fills in the choruses, pushing the song in directions the singing alone could never take it. ""Jackie"" is catchy with an unusual arrangement and is worth tracking down. The other standout is the instrumental ""Stone"", a cheerful slice of technopop with a great squiggly synth hook and a disposition indebted to Kraftwerk's vision of technology's sunny future. After that, it gets pretty grim. The backing music on <i>The Needle Was Travelling
    </i> is a lush and generally appealing mix of guitars and synths, blended together in such a way that instrumental differentiation is difficult. As far as production goes, Tarwater remains proficient. But songs need to be judged as songs, and these aren't very good.</p></div>"|7950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7950-the-needle-was-travelling/|4.0|Mark Richardson

For instance, the Raveonettes produce their best material when Sune Rose Wagner makes himself work resourcefully within specifically defined boundaries. The band's first album, <i>Whip It On</i>, was written entirely in B-flat minor using only three chords, and Wagner and Sharin Foo banned hi-hats and cymbals and capped every song before the three-minute mark, resulting in a consistent gloom that, truth be told, didn't make it any less gimmicky or any more listenable. They fared much better on their major-label debut, <i>Chain Gang of Love</i>, its songs likewise limited to three minutes per song, three chords, and, most critically, B-flat major.</p><p>
    
    These self-imposed constraints, along with liberal doses of distortion, created an intriguing duality: They put the band closer to their 1950s rock influences and made them sound much more primitive than they actually were, but the scuzziness of their sound also put a modern stance on their backwards glance, making their nostalgia for 50s delinquent cool much more useful than the rampant 60s garage rock retro. For all their reverence for Gene Vincent and namesake Buddy Holly, the Raveonettes weren't revivalists so much as revisionists, retrofitting their rock with all the explicit sexuality and dark violence that 50 years ago could only be conveyed implicitly.</p><p>
    
    If the Raveonettes adopted any specific musical constraints on <i>Pretty in Black</i>, they're not very evident. Keys vary over the course of the album, and all but three tracks defiantly bound past the three-minute mark. The band has more than doubled in size, growing from a duo into a quintet and allowing Foo to set aside her bass and concentrate on singing. She and Wagner pick up around the same place they left off, with two sex-driven songs that would fit well onto <i>Chain Gang of Love</i> (""Seductress of Bums"" and ""Love in a Trashcan""), but then, over the course of the album, they gradually widen their scope as they road-test a variety of styles-- SoCal folk rock, fuzzed-out disco, New Wave, Wall of Sound-- and collaborate with some of their forebears, including Suicide's Martin Rev, Velvet Underground drummer Moe Tucker, and Ronnie Spector.</p><p>
    
    With guests coming over, the Raveonettes have tided up their sound and made it presentable, removing all that screeching feedback in favor of a spic-and-span aesthetic. While such a move seems, in retrospect, inevitable, the spotless production undermines several songs, most notably ""Here Comes Mary"", highlighting the 
    band's 
    retro contrivances as they merely mimic rather than reimagine their 
    influences.</p><p>
    
    Wagner and Foo's ambitions, however, produce many inspired moments: ""Twilight"" pairs an inverted ""Twilight Zone"" guitar line with a fuzzed-out and sexed-up disco beat. Fortunately, ""Sleepwalking"" doesn't try to rewrite the Santo &amp; Johnny hit (Modest Mouse beat them to it anyway), but generates a forward-leaning groove that, thanks to Foo's gauzy vocals, sounds almost like shoegazer.</p><p>
    
    A lovely summer paean, ""Ode to L.A."" floats aloft on Spector's woah-oh-ohs, despite the fact that her voice has grown grainy with age and she can't hit the notes as confidently as she did with the Ronettes (or even with Eddie Money). Maybe it's that she's singing with a band half her age, but Spector sounds wistful for the past, and this tender nostalgia gives her vocals both a sadness and the authority of experience. Sensing their leading lady's vulnerability, Wagner and Foo wrap the music around her like a warm blanket.</p><p>
    
    Moments like this instill the Raveonettes' music with something more than easy nostalgia for a sound they're too young to have experienced firsthand. But some constraints might have been useful: <i>Pretty in Black</i> sounds scattershot as Wagner and Foo chase after so many musical styles, some easily captured but others slippery and elusive. Such a pursuit may be admirable and even necessary, but here it creates a diverted and shapeless album that only hints at what they're capable of accomplishing.</p></div>"|6699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6699-pretty-in-black/|6.8|Stephen M.

Not only did all the pacing make you look like a moron, but the whole process had a way of making you really, really need the bathroom, leading to bad decisions you'd regret just as soon as you'd relieved yourself.</p><p>
    
    This was the kind of thing that passed for bleak in the 1990s. And Stereolab, at least, made things easier on you, periodically collecting all the rarities you couldn't afford into their series of <i>Switched On</i> compilations. All you had to do to hear, say, <i>Music for the Amorphous Body Center</i> was wait patiently for a couple years-- pretty much like file-sharing on a dial-up connection.</p><p>
    
    The thing that made the waiting difficult-- and the compilations useful-- was that Stereolab's sidelines tended to be better than a lot of groups' careers. This was, after all, the era's top record-collector band, and half of the appeal was their ability to tinker with genre in exactly the way EPs are built for. At their best, what you got out of a new Stereolab track wasn't just a new ""song,"" but a new sound-- some way of stylizing their scattered interests (krautrock? French pop? bossa nova? Moog records? exotica? the Jetsons?) into something unexpected.</p><p>
    
    As a result, the tracks that weaved around their full-lengths felt less like cast-offs and more like peeks into an alternate history, a space that could include whatever tried-on styles didn't quite fit with a given album. By the tail end of the decade, the music on their EPs was beginning to feel even more accessible than the LPs they accompanied-- thanks to a streak of simple, swinging pop songs that didn't yet fit with the Groop's forward-thinking image.</p><p>
    
    Those EPs, though, never qualified for the <i>Switched On</i> treatment. So now it's time to thank Stereolab for releasing this comprehensive box set-- a total beast of a package, spanning three full discs of EP material, over a time period stretching from 1993's <i>Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements to 2001's </i><i>Sound-Dust</i>. Plus there's a bonus DVD of videos and television performances. Plus it's totally pop. Plus it costs less than $25.</p><p>
    
    Less than $25! Artless as it might seem for critics to talk money, it's that low price point that makes me forgive the bizarre form these songs have been squeezed into. Before I caught that dollar sign, I was ready to spend several paragraphs bitching: If the idea was to compile a complete package, wouldn't you think they'd have lined up the EPs chronologically, each in its original sequence? And if the idea was just to let casual fans catch up, wouldn't you think they'd have cut out the album tracks that anchored most EPs, saving us the trouble of a third disc? Why go for a jumble like this one, where strings of terrific songs leave you feeling like you've got your hands on the ultimate <i>Switched On</i>, strings of album tracks leave you feeling like you've bought a weirdly-selected hits compilation, and odd juxtapositions seem to be trying to make the band's drony-motorik phases interchangeable with the fluffy pop of later records?</p><p>
    
    Despite the complaints, anyone who enjoys Stereolab's late-90s albums will find more than enough here to satisfy, particularly where those pop impulses are concerned. Most thrilling of all are the releases that accompanied <i>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</i> and <i>Dots and Loops</i>, a period when the band tackled the EP as a way to try its hand at traditional pop forms; ""Brigitte"" is all slow, wet melody, and songs like ""Allures"" have a rainy-day pop swing that winds up feeling more Scandinavian than it does French.</p><p>
    
    Those who've been waiting for this set will be even happier with the songs from the terrific <i>Flourescences</i> EP, which is as neat a pop package as you could ask for-- running from the flute-punctuated sway on the title track to the super-sunny bounce of ""Pinball"", the only song I know of whose creators can reasonably claim it was inspired by both Heavenly and Van Halen. By the time you get back around to the horn-swept lullabies on ""You Used to Call Me Sadness"" (already on one <i>Switched On</i> comp), it becomes clearer than ever why this band used to share fans with the early Cardigans; nothing says ""retro-futurism"" quite like stylizing old-fashioned pop into such clean, bubbly forms.</p><p>
    
    Fans of the band's earlier, fiercer days will find slightly less to work with. Most of the drone here comes from <i>Mars Audiac Quintet</i>, the turning point between the buzzy charge they started off with and the well-groomed pop styles that eventually won them over. Tracks from the <i>Wow and Flutter</i> EP have plenty of bite, and part four of ""Nihilist Assault Group"" may be as hard as they've ever rocked, but inclusions from the <i>Ping Pong</i> singles hew closer to the album's moony, melodic pulse. (The two-chord organ line on ""Pain et Spectacles"" should top charts on its own.)</p><p>
    
    More space winds up occupied by newer material, much of it from after the point where some fans (this reviewer included) fret that Stereolab's output began to feel vaguely academic; something always seems to have gone amiss when a band that could float gorgeously on two chords starts throwing in pedal-steel interludes just to keep you interested. Mixed in like this, though, you can start to appreciate them without your disappointment hackles raised. While some tracks from <i>The Free Design</i> and <i>Captain Easychord</i> (which prefaced <i>Cobra...</i> and <i>Sound-Dust</i>, respectively) seem to be trying and failing to find the vigor and ease of earlier work, they're still a pretty admirable extension of those earlier pop-experiment sidelines.</p><p>
    
    And the tracks here seem to unfold into shinier gems the more you listen: ""Soop Groove #1"" like a tweaked-out cousin to ""Metronomic Underground"", ""Spinal Column"" twisting melodic intervals like never before, ""Les Aimes"" doing spooky Brazilian, and ""Long Life Love"" letting the late Mary Hansen chirp her way from the moon-lounge to the earth-bound swing and back.</p><p>
    
    In summary: Not even $25! This may not be the band-history primer some people would like to say it is; give it to your favorite teenage rockers and they'll probably just wonder if people spent the whole of the late 1990s being quite so sweet and dreamy. And packing up like this certainly won't stop Stereolab from becoming the kind of group whose new albums people buy because they've ""heard so much about the band"" and then never really listen to. But for anyone who's already tapped in to the peaks of this band's career, the bulk of this stuff will prove exactly what you want out of EP material: Just as good as the albums, only different.</p></div>"|7503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7503-oscillons-from-the-anti-sun/|8.0|Nitsuh Abebe

After toiling for years in relative obscurity under the aliases Dima (as good as the name suggests) and Hustler Pornstar (uh, ditto), the Frenchman didn't just draw blood with Vitalic's 2001 <em>Poney EP</em>, he lopped a few arteries. Seriously, it's hard to overstate the response to <em>Poney</em>; of its four tracks, three became high-tide dancefloor staples. Along with the dark, yawning electro of ""Poney Part 1"" and ""Poney Part 2"", there was the centerpiece ""La Rock 01"", still the reigning champion of songs that sound like paper shredders orgying in a wind tunnel.</p><p>  While everyone from 2 Many DJs to Aphex Twin to Sven Väth was busy corking their sets with one (or two, or three...) tracks from <em>Poney</em>, Arbez was studiously lifting a few PR moves from his contemporaries, first by playing up his anonymity and later by concocting an elaborate backstory that involved a Ukrainian upbringing, animal fur trading, male prostitution, and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Despite being offered enough shows to keep him busy until the fall of the Wailing Wall, Arbez chose his live engagements carefully. He applied a similar selectivity to his output, issuing only a few 12""'s and a handful of choice remixes over the next few years.</p><p>  That lull didn't do much to temper the weighty expectations placed on his full-length debut-- Lord knows, the <em>Human After All</em>-shaped hole in a lot of people's springtime playlists probably didn't help either. Happily, I can't imagine anyone who cared for Vitalic's earlier material being disappointed with <em>OK Cowboy</em>. Part of that is because <em>Poney</em> is built into this record's DNA-- rather than feeling like cursory inclusions, the EP's big three tracks sit beautifully alongside Arbez's less dancefloor-friendly, album-oriented material. The result is a much more complete and crafted record than you'd expect from an artist renowned for his killer singles.</p><p>  Not unlike LCD Soundsystem's best maximalist moments, the bulk of <em>OK Cowboy</em>'s action happens in the mid and high registers. In the same way that most indie bands look to guitars to do the bulk of their storytelling, Arbez leans pretty compulsively on his synths-- that probably explains why so many have glommed onto words like ""metallic"" and ""rock"" to describe Vitalic's sound.</p><p>  The big new single here is ""My Friend Dario"", a jackhammering quiet-loud-quiet-loud guitar workout thing whose biggest fault is that it doesn't sound all that unlike Primal Scream's turn of the decade guitar techno coke freakout schtick. While it's a worthy enough addition as Vitalic burnburners go, it's hardly a patch on ""No Fun"" and ""Newman"", both of which boast synth lines that start out as pneumatic wheezes and turn into floor-swallowing squelches.</p><p>  But we already knew Arbez could do acid for the end of the world. What's more surprising are his slower songs, the plaintive bits and bobs that comprise the album's glue. Equal parts jerky organ workouts (""Wooo""), spacey Baroquisms (""The Past""), and funhouse melodies (""Polkamatic""), these tracks sketch out the other side of a polarity (sweet, charming Gallicisms on one side, four-alarm fires on the other) that, when its all said and done, has us thinking about that one French duo again. Not because Vitalic is a second generation imitation (Daft Punk has always had more grease in their wheels), but because he's made a record that's in the same league as <em>Homework</em> or <em>Discovery</em>. </p><p> </p></div>"|8538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8538-ok-cowboy/|8.6|Mark Pytlik

It's an approach obviously not without risks, as the virtually quirk-free <i>Laughter's Fifth</i> settles nearly its entire weight onto Jayne's songwriting shoulders. Fortunately, however, it's a load Jayne sounds as if he was born to tote, and here he delivers what is undoubtedly his tightest, most satisfying batch of songs to date.</p><p>
    
    It's certainly a far cry from the disjointed, garagey fray of such early albums as <i>The Greks Bring Gifts</i> or <i>#1 U.S.A.</i>, although even back when L\A\L was essentially Jayne's lo-fi solo project his fondness for foursquare Keith Richards chords and distorted Crazy Horse jamming crept itself in like jimson weed. Now, with the able-bodied assistance of bassist Brandon Angle and drummer Zeke Howard, Jayne truly has a band with no interest in doing things by half-measures, and <i>Laughter's Fifth</i> veritably rings with barstool drawls, mutton-chop riffs, and burly Creedence choruses.</p><p>
    
    Though raucous tracks such as ""Every Midnight Song"" and ""Idol Worship!, Idol Worship!"" contain glimmers of L\A\L's grungier past, gone are the noisy Sonic Youth-inspired deformations that peppered albums like Destination 2000. Here Jayne's songs build their muscles through old-fashioned sweat and craftsmanship rather than feedback and distortion, with an unerring sense for when to pull back and when to pile on. On ""Dirty Lives"" the group marries its agreeably crunchy guitars to handclaps and a bouncy, almost new-wavish bassline to create album's most immediately addictive song, while the meditative ""Pulsar Radio"" constructs its passionate melodicism atop rich organ swells and chintzy low-tech bossanova beats.</p><p>
    
    For the most part, though, Love as Laughter simply settle into the loose, rib-joint grooves of tracks like the opening ""In Amber"" or the wry ""I'm a Ghost"" (""I float throughout your house at parties/ Flirting with your guests sometimes...I'm a real nice guy for a ghost"") with such an infectious sense of rumpled delight that one is generally able to overlook the music's many ancestral debts. Though certainly not a head-turner as a vocalist, Jayne commits to these tracks with an amiable enthusiasm, and his guitar playing is deceptively stellar. The floorboards do sag a bit beneath the generic ""Survivors"" or the oddly anti-climactic closer ""Makeshift Heart""-- middling cuts which slow the album's overall momentum-- but these rare missteps are not enough to dim <i>Laughter's Fifth</i> understated, majestic glow.</p></div>"|4881.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4881-laughters-fifth/|7.8|Matthew Murphy

    time, criminally underappreciated, it's influential yet out of print,
    whatevs. So there's something really refreshing about Swami reissuing
    the Penetrators' oeuvre just for the hell of it. Who needs reasons
    when you've got a reissue label and a bunch of tatty vinyl and live
    tapes sitting around?</p><p>
    
    The Penetrators didn't make much noise outside of Syracuse, but for once, it's not because national heads weren't ready for their
    prophecies-- there's little to recommend them for anything beyond the
    local bar and basement circuit. Centered around Eliot (""Spike"") Kagan
    and Jack Lipton, the Penetrators released a few singles on their own
    Fred Records, shot a video for ""Shopping Bag"" that was summarily
    rejected by MTV (but got much love on Syracuse's public access cable),
    and petered out. They were a bunch of hammy dudes with bushy hair and
    smarmy mustaches, DIY as fuck (this may have been pragmatic-- it's
    difficult to imagine anyone doing it for them). Otherwise, they were a
    typical garage band, rocking hard and slightly sucking in the best way
    imaginable.</p><p>
<em>Basement Anthology</em> doesn't so much redress an injustice
    as it laughs in the face of common sense. But a neat thing happens-- instead of sitting down with a punk reissue touted as important and
    trying to hear its salience through a bunch of tinny crashing and
    banging, you can enjoy the Penetrators' life's work for what it is: A bunch of dudes having fun, banging out garage anthems
    that hit the usual marks-- boredom and apathy on the wailing ""Teenage
    Lifestyle""; complacent consumption on the skronking stomper ""Shopping
    Bag""; the redemptive power of rock on ""Rock-N-Roll Face"" (""But you
    can't get on my case/ When I wear my rock-n-roll face!"").</p><p>
    
    But most indicative of the Penetrators' spirit is ""#1 Band
    in Town"", which might as well have been called ""Penetrators' Theme"".
    Over a righteously swaggering riff, the band proclaims their dominance
    in a big sing-along: ""We're the Penetrators, we don't fuck around/
    'Cause we're the number one band in this town!"" While this record is
    thrillingly inessential, it's a time capsule for a simpler musical
    era, before the Internet and the indie infrastructure existed, when
    the being the best band in town was really something to be proud of.

    cult favorite to consistent hitmakers since the success of 2002's <em>The 
    Remote Part</em>. <em>Warnings/Promises</em> is a step 
    in the same direction, the work of a polished radio-ready rock band, 
    and if I had to sum it up in a word, it'd be ""comfortable"": Comfortable 
    in writing calculated hits like ""Love Steals Us From Loneliness"" or ""I 
    Understand It""; comfortable filling an arena with songs like ""I Want a 
    Warning""; comfortable with the R.E.M comparisons that have followed 
    them throughout their career-- on ""Not Just Sometimes But Always"" 
    Roddy Woomble is a dead ringer for Michael Stipe.</p><p>
    
    But ""comfortable"" is far from 
    worthy. <em>Warnings</em> is Idlewild's first record without original 
    bassist Bob Fairfoull, and their first written as a five-piece-- they now 
    include a second guitarist and bassist culled from their touring band 
    (Allan Stewart and Gavin Fox). It's neither a shock that they've defanged their sound nor that they 
    followed <em>The Remote Part</em> with a record that's even more sedate. Fast tempos and distorted guitars don't 
    always equate to passionate performances, but nothing on 
    <em>Warnings/Promises</em> quite does. These songs chart easy territory: ""Love Steals Us 
    From Loneliness"" has the tried-and-true quiet/soft dynamic and some 
    background oohs and aahs, so there's your single. ""Welcome Home"" is the 
    acoustic ballad that must follow, and ""I Want a Warning"" is the 
    swaggering rocker that brings it up a notch after that (though it's one of 
    <em>Warning</em>'s better performances). ""As if I Hadn't Slept"" adds a dash 
    of pedal steel to it's clean guitars to signify panoramic country-pop, 
    and ""El Captain"" throws some misplaced disco rhythms as a coda to it's 
    piano-driven radio baiting.</p><p>
    
    To their credit, Woomble's melodies on ""As If I Hadn't 
    Slept"" or ""I Understand It"" are exquisite, but they're dulled by ordinary 
    arrangements, and he's leaning harder on Stipe here than ever with his delivery 
    and harmonies. Songwriting chemistry is a tricky thing, and while having 
    two or three competing voices can push writers to new heights, a group 
    of five here leads to songs that are 
    merely passable. Bottom line, if you've got five songwriters 
    ready to take on the world and the best you can give us is ""Love Steals 
    Us From Happiness"", this is an unfortunate let down.</p></div>"|4064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4064-warningspromises/|6.2|Jason Crock

    Name and game locked up in his harbor hometown's multiculturalism, Our Man From Odessa liked Kraftwerk and Giorgio as a cosmonaut-aspirant jugend (his name is ""German""). He did pirate radio (but not ""pirate radio"") via shortwave Western pap-loving Romanian broadcasts, and when stuff happened 89ish OMFO planned himself a trip around a Europe-- a Eurotrip-- during which he sampled the continent's musical flavors, collected its most bizarre instruments and synthesizers, and (I hear) played rhythm guitar for the Hungarian version of ""Scotty Doesn't Know"".</p><p>
    
    OMFO, in other words, has made one half his career collecting kitsch, our tired melodies and worn chords and stale rhythms, and the other half playing it back to us verbatim, veiling it hardly save with aimless electro-cosmopolitanism b/w authentic, localized instrumentation. Say the liners: ""Electronically enhanced, [the songs] develop a life of their own, where futurism meets imaginary folklore."" Hey dude, so did my ""In Da Club"" ringtone-- three years ago.</p><p>
    
    ""Trans Balkan Express"" is-- really now-- a hora borrowing big beat and Balkan bagpipes; ""Tixi Rock"" is tin pan blues, but with italo synth and rain dance flute (probably a preset); ""Chupino"" is an accordion jamming hard over a canned riddim. Do I even need to explain ""Drimba 'n' Bass""? What about ""Space Hora Dub""?</p><p>
    
    Two problems I've created for myself here. Actually three. First, everything in the graf about sounds pretty awesome, doesn't it? The prospect of OMFO <i>is</i> flat-out exciting, really, just like what happened last year when this very same label put out <i>Rio Baile Funk: Favela Booty Beats</i>. Releases like this work well if only because they promise completely alien music-- some pocket of this earth that exists away from the panopticon of the internet and blogosphere and A&amp;R; poaching. Lots fail me because, like <i>TBE</i>, they turn out to be boring Western pop with glass-bottom gimmicks. I'll take a Sonic Youth rip over that any day.</p><p>
    
    Second, I'm afraid I've made OMFO out to be Osama, Manson, other Manson, Chevy Chase, and Lance Armstrong all in one-- like, the worst dude ever. I can't imagine OMFO's character being necessarily applicable either way, but for hermeneutics' sake he does seem genuinely proud of this stuff, and this particular bit-- ""Though it remains unclear whether the 'Trans Balkan Express' is a train or a space ship, these are territories that no human ear has ever dared to explore. Ladies and gentlemen: We are floating in Eastern European space""-- melts my decimal-point heart.</p><p>
    
    And number three, how can I slag OMFO for playing dress-up but praise M.I.A. for rootless multiculturalism? Well guess what: you got me. I've been lying all along. OMFO is awesome.</p></div>"|6111.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6111-trans-balkan-express/|3.9|Nick Sylvester

Their LP <i>The Art of Rolling</i> is an exhumed time capsule of 60s mod and psychedelica. Of course, considering how fellow Scandinavians the Hives, Raveonettes, and Soundtrack of Our Lives have all scored hit singles in the U.K and/or U.S. by channeling British invasion bands, the Blue Van's gritty, unaffected emulation of 60s blues-rock seems pretty logical, right down to the Andy Warhol-inspired album cover and mop-top hairdos.</p><p>
    
    On <i>The Art of Rolling</i>, however, these guys don't simply pay homage to the Sixties, they seem to actually believe they're in the decade. A Hammond organ tinges every track, and singer/guitarist Steffen Westmark uses a tube amp to replicate the raw, crunchy guitar sound of early axe gods like Dave Davies. Drummer Per Jorgenson's hyperactive pounding recalls Keith Moon; crash symbols are used as hi-hats, the snare takes a serious flogging, and massive tom fills are thrown in at nearly every transition. For better or worse, the lyrics are equally dated, seldom addressing issues more dynamic than lovesickness, desperation, or down-on-your-luck blues. ""I Want You"" simultaneously steals the riff, hook, and lyric of the Kinks' ""I Need You"", and the same helpless romantic sentiment can be found in ""I Remember the Days"", ""Revelation of Love"", and ""Word From the Bird"".</p><p>
    
    Word on the streets is that these guys are fun live, and they financed this album by playing about 50 electrifying, sold-out shows in Brooklyn. Maybe so, but on record I don't buy it. Sure, most tracks start with a funky drumbeat overdubbed with shouting and laughter, but that doesn't mean a party's going on. Too many progressions are pulled straight from blues guitar exercise books to conjure up much stimulation, and even at their most inventive, the Blue Van maybe sound worthy of an iPod commercial spot.</p><p>
    
    To be fair, we were all totally stoked as kids when we stumbled across our parents' record collection and discovered there <i>was</i> music out there more intense and enthralling than <i>The Little Mermaid</i> soundtrack. The Blue Van don't mean to rip off classic rock, they've just been in arrested development since age 11. Still, even in a scene where every band's aping the retro sound, the Blue Van still come off hackneyed. The Hives at least fuse seering garage punk to their Rolling Stones pomp, while the Raveonettes sound increasingly more shoegazer than surf rock with every album. So what's the Blue Van's twist on classic rock? They use more organ? Better sound mixing? They're from Broenderslev?</p></div>"|1158.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1158-the-art-of-rolling/|5.0|Adam Moerder

    Mark Oliver Everett is what epidemiologists and Dustin
    Hoffman call a hotspot, a highly contagious carrier of
    an extremely virulent disease who infects anyone who
    crosses his path. With each album the
    self-abbreviated E releases upon the unsuspecting
    world, waves of melancholy diffuse outward like an
    oil slick, engulfing all who dare to listen. Six
    records into a career most thought would fizzle into
    little more than inclusion on <i>The Buzz</i> compilation,
    Everett has proved a persistent auteur obsessed with
    human emotion, following his mental health muse to
    increasingly elaborate sounds.</p><p>
<i>Blinking Lights</i> is a clear sign that Everett's fuel tank is
    not running dry; if anything, his momentum
    is only building. This time around, E has so many
    ways to describe his damaged psyche, it can't be
    contained by merely one disc, sprawling out to a
    runtime somewhere between <i>Being There</i> and <i>Melon
    Collie</i>. Within this extended framework, E finds the
    time to conduct thorough analyses of his sadness via a
    slew of genres and lyrical approaches, like he's
    trying to exorcise the ghost that haunts him by
    attacking from every possible angle.</p><p>
    Right about now is where you start to think I'm
    beating this angle into the ground, that I'm making
    fun of Everett for his lack of subject matter
    diversity. Trust me I'm not, and I grant that E
    certainly has the biographical details to support any
    degree of sustained mood disorder. But neither do I
    exaggerate the single-mindedness of his approach;
    every time he finds solace in the arms of a girl
    (""Sweet L'il Thing"") or grows weary of the infinite
    sadness (""Suicide Life"") it's followed up by an
    immediate bat to the knee, chasing any good vibes back
    into the closet.</p><p>
    Of course, you might not pick up on this stationary
    raincloud just with a surface listen, as E continues
    to prove himself a master of wrapping depressive
    material in deceptively soothing or poppy packages. 
    Whether it's the <i>That Thing You Do</i> parody of ""Goin'
    Fetal"", or <i>The Soft Bulletin</i> sweep of ""Old Shit/New
    Shit"", or the early-period Tom Waits lounge-sleaze of
    ""Son of a Bitch"", Everett dips into 31 flavors of
    sound for the record's 33 tracks. Generally, the more elements Everett
    piles on, the more interesting things get, such as the
    ""Mr. Blue Sky"" orchestrics of ""Losing Streak"", or the
    surf drum/spaghetti western collision of ""Old Shit/New
    Shit"".</p><p>
    Well, OK, maybe I'm overstating the variety for the
    sake of a bad ice-cream joke, as the majority of the
    tracks fall under the umbrella of slow guitar or piano
    dirges. Unfortunately, these are also the weakest of
    the bunch, the ones that find E veering most
    dangerously towards cliché and routine: peep the
    yikes-metaphor supporting the faux-collar folk of
    ""Railroad Man"". They also tend to be the ones where
    he can't help but sound like Beck, with his raspy
    drone and taste for vocal-filtering. Of course,
    pilfering the melody for ""Nobody's Fault But My Own""
    (""In the Yard, Behind the Church"") doesn't help his
    cause.</p><p>
    Here's the part where I fulfill my critic's duty by
    proclaiming that, as always, <i>Blinking Lights</i> would've
    been better as a single album, focusing less on the
    dull, Jon Brion clone theme song that recurs
    throughout, while also dropping a handful of the
    piano-and-groan duets. Ten years after ""Novocaine for
    the Soul"" was one of those weird, forgotten alt-rock
    hits, that same formula is still what works best
    for E: ethereal, odd, and catchy arrangements like
    album MVP ""Trouble with Dreams""; songs that file the sharp
    corners off the dispiriting thesis statement for his
    career. There's a good album underneath all the
    filler-- probably the Eels' best since <i>Electro-Shock
    Blues</i>-- but it'll take some editing to excavate it.</p></div>"|2688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2688-blinking-lights-and-other-revelations/|6.5|Rob Mitchum

In a child's mind, grown-ups are distinguished by their calves, raindrops on car windows can become aliens racing through space, and long backseat rides furnished with action figures set the stage for <em>Lord of the Rings</em>-scale epics. By now it's axiomatic that most popular entertainment misses childhood's true majesty, but every once in a while a <em>Peanuts</em> or <em>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</em> hits upon just the right mixture of confusion and imagination.</p><p> <em>The Best Party Ever</em>, which compiles the first three singles plus five new tracks from UK-based The Boy Least Likely To, shares that youthful, existential whimsy. This isn't children's music, but it takes a child-like eye to Postcard bedsit pop awash in 1960s California sunshine with hints of country and soul. Recorders, twinkling synths, handclaps, banjos, and glockenspiel accompany the requisitely shambling acoustic guitar on songs about tigers, monsters, growing up, and ""Warm Panda Cola."" <em>The Best Party Ever</em> is a thing of wonder, made out of rubber and springs-- heartache with a sense of humor.</p><p>  The band name (a regendered Morrissey song title) and the album moniker both cry ""twee,"" and there's no denying The Boy Least Likely To's recurring fuzzy wuzzyness. But solid songwriting sets the duo of Pete and singer/lyricist Jof apart from the anonymous Belle and Sebastian novitiates responsible for stigmatizing indie pop in some hipper-than-thou circles. Opener ""Be Gentle With Me"" could be about new love or a budding playground friendship, and it contains multitudes of appealing elements, from its opening starward gaze to a stomping country-disco beat to bizarre non sequiturs like ""I want to pick peaches off a cherry tree."" Winning melodies and the album's likable if neurotic raconteur-- ""Scared of spiders/ Scared of flying""-- give the quirky arrangements an emotional payoff.</p><p>  Besides, for all its playfulness <em>The Best Party Ever</em> isn't quite the doe-eyed ""Hakuna Matata"" some early reviews have suggested. Jof's narrator is child-like, but it's just a case of arrested development-- a young man confronting early adulthood in this chaotic century, not with the stoned quotidian of the Streets or the post-apocalyptic communalism of the Arcade Fire, but through a regression into childhood. Thus spooky-synth jam ""Monsters"" sees friends and loved ones terrifying the narrator by ""getting married, having babies""-- and suggesting he'd be happier if he did, too. The gleefully paranoid ""I See Spiders When I Close My Eyes"" briefly reveals the anxiety beneath its stiff-lipped cheer: ""How did I get to be a mess so soon in my life?"" Aching standout ""The Battle of the Boy Least Likely To"" features a prominent, ""Sloop John B""-like recorder with quavering vocals about letting go; the effect is akin to a child's first encounter with death.</p><p>  Yet above all, <em>The Best Party Ever</em> is as fun as pelting Susie Derkins with water balloons. ""I'm Glad I Hitched My Apple Wagon to Your Star"" lives up to its lengthy title with the best-ever musical mention of antihistamines and the tale of an ill-fated Nashville excursion over ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" oompahs. ""We never did get famous, but it made us kinda happy and it kept me off of drugs!"" Jof explains. ""My Tiger My Heart"" recalls a Psapp album title for a ballad that's a bit like ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" meets <em>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</em> or <em>Winnie the Pooh</em>, as Jof relates the difficulty of being ""friends with something that eats butterflies and pencil sharpenings.""</p><p>  The album's best song, the dreamy ""Paper Cuts"", channels Brian Wilson via <em>Summerteeth</em>-era Wilco through the lens of Aztec Camera. It's a broken-hearted ballad about helplessness against an ever-changing world, but it also points to the essential precariousness of what makes The Boy Least Likely To so appealing. ""If you throw a light on something magical it disappears,"" sings Jof. Let's hope not.</p><p> </p></div>"|1157.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1157-the-best-party-ever/|8.5|Marc Hogan

Physically, their impossibly wan expressions work overtime to contrast their black-hole locks, suggesting brooding dichromatic cartoon characters. And their hammer-to-the-head blunt takes on Nietzsche and nihilism are equally cartoonish; such stunted ideas of death, destruction, and anarchy are as awe-inspiring to wayward teens as they are laughable to about everyone else.</p><p>
    Both skinny puppies spent the 1990s pushing industrial music in new, sometimes striking directions only to run out of black nail polish near the turn of the century. Similarly, the duo released bloated double albums a few years ago only to come back in the last few months with stripped-down, self-consciously ""raw"" follow-ups. After taking industrial to its logical noise-soaked endpoint, Empire struggles on his misleadingly titled <i>Futurist, which eschews his forward-thinking dancefloor-clearing breakbeats and Eno-style ambient ramblings for a more up-front punk approach. Though he's still scowling and screaming with verve, the traditional song structures and relatively mild rock production unfortunately puts more emphasis on his straight-faced, literal-as-fuck lyrics.</i></p><p>
    ""Kiss of Death"" is the first and best track on the record, with the following 11 songs relegated to less inspired versions of the same Pistols-meets-KMFDM formula. The guitars dominate the mix throughout, their power chord fury nearly matching Empire's corrosive, distorted vocal. ""<i>I'm Here to stay!!! You better watch out cuz I came to terminate!!!!"" he sings with genuine, if somewhat pathetic, passion (capitalization and punctuation based on his official site, natch). For any other artist, the track would be considered quite breakneck but compared to his own brand of television-static cocaine-jungle, ""Kiss of Death"" is almost midtempo. The three-chord simplicity is admirable and refreshing at first, though it quickly starts to wear thin in all respects.</i></p><p>
    It's easy to poke fun at Alec's somewhat lost-in-translation goth-gangster pose, but for all his anti-establishment hollering, Empire's mantras often come off as a tad militaristic in their repetitive simplicity. On the monotonous ""Point of No Return"", it's not enough to repeat the title over and over (and over), he even goes on to explain it, in case you were confused: ""You can't go back even if you wanted to."" There's reinforcing the humorless German stereotype and then, it seems, there's Alec Empire.</p><p>
    When wrapped in confrontational music that matches his unwavering hatred of ""the man,"" Empire can be enthralling but <i>Futurist</i>'s sordid punk suggests our man may have cornered himself. Now in his 30s, this black-clad fist-pumper has always been at his best when taking into account all of his industrial influences, from Einstürzende Neubauten to Ministry, and spewing them out in brain-cell-crushing odes to nothingness. <i>Futurist</i>, with its muddy, one-note punk-thrash revivalism that belies his talents as a versatile studio auteur, is as frustratingly unremarkable and immobile as the governments he so blatantly rails against.</p></div>"|2780.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2780-futurist/|3.7|Ryan Dombal

With a
    goofy drawl and sloppy piano-fisting (SFW, natch), Folds alternately
    threw stones and built glass houses. He'd mock a too-cool coterie of
    nose-ringed goths and closeted ex-Cure fans (ah, those innocent
    pre-Killers 1990s!), then let his guard down for ballads about
    heartbreak and, yes, the abortion that hurtled the Five through fame's
    window like a post-Final Four student rioter's ""Brick"". His
    hipster-baiting, sincerity and modest fame guaranteed a few nasty
    reviews, sure. Still, Folds challenged cred-consciousness before
    crying ""rockist!"" was OTM. Wussy, yes, but worthy.</p><p>
    
    Folds may as well have dubbed his second ""TJ Hooker""-free solo album
    <em>Wuss and Wussier</em>. <em>Songs for Silverman</em> doesn't mean
    anything, anyway. Hey, just like the title of BFF swan song <em>The
    Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner</em>! This time out, Folds
    tries to combo-meal his bratpop funnin' and balladic touchy-feely, but
    though a genial intelligence remains, the #2 is rarely funny or
    touching. Forget <em>Rockin' the Suburbs</em>; the new Folds can barely
    rock an infant to sleep, though at one point he tries.</p><p>
    
    Wuss-out #1: Opener ""Bastard"" sneers at an old man. Hey, just like
    ""Uncle Walter""! Except in this case the old man is really a young man
    who's heard it at all, perhaps a cynical hipster. Hey, just like
    ""Underground"" or ""The Battle of Who Could Care Less"" or ""Rockin' the
    Suburbs"" or ""There's Always Someone Cooler Than You""! Except, as
    throughout <em>Songs for Silverman</em>, Folds' once-brutish
    ivory-stomping has softened to Nordstrom lobby levels (otherwise he's
    ditched <em>Suburbs</em>' MTV-striving sheen for faux-Five). Dude says
    this one's really about young conservatives, but the lyrics sure are
    careful not to crap on potential purchasers' fresh-pressed khakis.</p><p>
    
    Wuss-out #2: ""Jesusland"" opens with a propulsive, swirling chord
    progression. Hey, just like ""Ascent of Stan""! In post-Schiavo,
    Tom DeLay-era, post-contraceptive (wait, that's next year) Amerika,
    entire box sets could be devoted to ruminations on the nation that
    neighbors the United States of Canada, from Toby Keith pro to Billy
    Joe anti, or even apolitically humanistic (hey, just like ""Brick""!).
    Except the best Folds can muster is stale McMansion jokes. Even
    <em>Time</em> covergirl Ann Coulter wouldn't call Folds a traitor for
    this bland waffle.</p><p>
    
    Wuss-out #3: ""Late"" is about Elliott Smith. Hey, there's a classically
    unadorned yet vivid Folds lyric: ""Elliott, man, you played a fine
    guitar/ And some dirty basketball."" Except the chorus goes: ""It's too
    late/ It's too late/ Nah, don't you know/ It's been too late."" Not
    ""Candle in the Wind"", but hardly a fitting tribute. Hey, do those
    somber chords sound more like ""Evaporated"" or ""Eddie Walker""?</p><p>
    
    Wuss-outs #4-#11: Hey, first single ""Landed"", a catchy sigh of
    post-breakup relief, takes off with a bitchin' piano riff that's just
    like ""Philosophy"" in a minor key! Folds followers will quibble over
    whether the Pure Prairie League pedal steel of ""Give Judy My Notice""
    betters the ponderous run-through from 2003's <em>Speed Graphic</em> EP,
    except who cares, it's not even as good as ""Carrying Cathy""! Hey,
    ""Time"" is almost the first verse of ""Narcolepsy"" plus a weirdly
    straight Weird Al. ""You to Thank""? Not bad, and hey best piano
    breakdown since ""Song for the Dumped""! Fatherly endearment ""Gracie""
    would be a charming pretension-clearer on a better album. I don't
    remember anything about ""Sentimental Guy"" or ""Prison Food"" except hey
    one of them starts like ""Emaline"".</p><p>
    
    Lest anyone suspect otherwise, I'm completely certain Folds could
    still kick my ass like one angry piano-juggling dwarf. It takes less
    guts to sit here and criticize than to go up on stage every night and
    shill for a mediocre new album, right?</p></div>"|3139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3139-songs-for-silverman/|5.8|Marc Hogan

    scene. A far cry from Keijo's spooky, noise-laden pastiches
    or Islaja's feral moan, <i>Growing Green</i> is subtly pastoral. Windblown
    acoustic guitars, flitting flutes, and melodic bass lines paint
    minimalist landscapes that tug at the imagination.</p><p>
    
    Haikenen's debut, <i>Growing
    Green</i>-- which comes three years after his first single, ""Harmless""-- is uncharacteristically piecemeal, a premature compendium of a
    young singer/songwriter's scattershot yield. Haikenen is 22, but he
    doesn't sound it. Maybe it's the reverb talking, but his voice-- a weary
    warble-- is weathered
    beyond its years.</p><p>
    
    Whereas ""Harmless"" drew Syd Barrett comparisons and even placed in
    Haikenen's hands, as <i>IDJ</i> so modestly put it, ""the future of electronic
    music,"" <i>Growing Green</i> is acoustic folk music, plain and simple. The
    album enters gingerly, as a lolling acoustic guitar works in the voids
    between distant bass rumblings. It sounds genteel, but
    Haikenen is feeling brassy: ""You are all whores, and I hate you all,""
    he sings. Surprising words, perhaps, but this song's strength is atmosphere. Haikenen's guitar
    playing, heavy yet luminous, shows a Nick Drake-ian sensibility.</p><p>
    
    Haikenen can be solitary or affable-- he undergoes abrupt mood
    shifts, vastly and somewhat whimsically altering the character of his
    voice. On the idyllic ""Yellow Leaves and White Trees"", he's gauzy and
    barely audible, following each few seconds of strumming with a wisp of
    vocal. ""Careless Me"", meanwhile, consolidates his variegated approach:
    as the volume builds (thanks mostly to accordion), Haikenen's voice
    gets lower and raspier. It's as if it has separate top and bottom
    compartments, to be favored and mixed as deemed fit.</p><p>
    
    ""I Watch The Sky"" tries too hard to find Dylan, and ""5 Bright Dawn""
    might as well be cutting'n'pasting passages from <i>Chronicles</i> before it
    gets all lo-fi scuzzy with some electric guitar and clangorous
    drumming. Next to the scruffier work of a
    more explorative folkie like Islaja, <i>Growing Green</i> could seem
    innocuous. But Haikenen is hardly conventional (see: the glacial sweep
    of ""Harmless"", the barren electronics on ""Cryosleep""). If anything,
    his relative straightforwardness stems partly from a diplomatic
    prowess that will only boost his export potential. At the album's
    dullest, remind yourself that the kid's just 22, and that if you sat
    with him round a bonfire listening to these songs, totally disarmed,
    you might soon be looking for a shoulder to weep on.</p></div>"|2592.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2592-growing-green/|7.5|Sam Ubl

After working with his post-NMH group Bablicon, Barnes has seen spot duty with Bright Eyes, the Gerbils, and Broadcast, and for the past few years has apparently been living life as something of an itinerant minstrel.</p><p>
    
    Over the course of his journeys-- in the past year alone he's lived in England, Prague, and New Mexico-- Barnes has accumulated fragments of ethnic folk dialects from seemingly every region on the atlas, and now as ringleader of A Hawk and a Hacksaw he ambitiously attempts to fuse these varied tongues into a unified, coherent vocabulary. <em>Darkness at Noon</em>, the second album from AHAAH, is a frenetic, dizzying pastiche of Eastern European folk, klezmer, mariachi, Appalachian fiddle music, and evocative jazz. And though Barnes and company fail to bring this bewildering array of streams into confluence, the album contains enough flashes of such melodic invention and daredevil instrumentation that armchair travelers can't help but be drawn to the group's exotic scrapbook.</p><p>
    
    A Hawk and a Hacksaw's eponymous 2004 debut was essentially a Barnes solo act, but on <em>Darkness at Noon</em> he receives valuable assistance from such talented vets as trumpeter Dan Clucas and tuba player Mark Weaver, and the album even includes unspecified contributions from NMH's Jeff Mangum. This expanded group, and Clucas' work in particular, helps infuse tracks like the opening ""Laughter in the Dark"" and ""Europa"" with a languorous, Old World beauty that at times even bears reflections of Sketches of Spain.</p><p>
    
    Generally speaking, the album tends to be most satisfying on its slower, more contemplative tracks, such as ""The Water Under the Moon"", a wistful, melodic ballad featuring violin, accordion and barroom tack piano, or ""Our Lady of the Vlatva"" which contains some lovely, Robert Wyatt-like vocalizing. Less beguiling are the handful of blustery up-tempo gypsy hybrids like ""The Moon Under Water"" or ""Wicky Pocky"", each of which are too frantically played and self-consciously eclectic to likely appeal to anyone who dances with less agility than Topol.</p><p>
    
    Between these occasional lapses in subtlety, however, <em>Darkness at Noon</em> amply illustrates Barnes' keen ear for songcraft and talent for judicious cross-cultural pilfering, and offers enough evidence to generate the speculative hope that A Hawk and a Hacksaw might someday prove able to blend its multiplicity of influences into a more cohesive alloy stamped with its own distinctive, individualized imprint.</p></div>"|4012.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4012-darkness-at-noon/|7.3|Matthew Murphy

It's the only word you could apply to all of the Denver quintet's music, from their loudest, fastest moment to their iciest piano passage. They bring their stately approach to a sound that migrates freely through cabaret, prog, country, folk, jazz, chamber music, and arena rock, often with a subtle electronic edge.</p><p>
    
    The crux of that sound is the voice of pianist John Grant, a powerful, rangy instrument he's not shy about wielding in all its booming glory. His piano playing is often just as weighty, and he opens <i>Goodbye with a chilly impressionist meditation reminiscent of the dolorous mid-section of Procol Harum's ""In Held 'Twas I"" before the title track clicks in with a gliding modern r&amp;b; groove. ""Goodbye"" is full of twists and turns, pulling its minor key melody through tempo changes and harmonized Radar Brothers slo-core detours in a sort of microcosmic sampler of the album in full.</i></p><p>
    
    The album's most impressive song, the soaring, crystalline ballad ""Paint the Moon"", has an exhilarating, simple melody, dramatic chord progressions, and a sweeping arrangement. The guitars spread like the sun on the Eastern slope of the Rockies, fanning out in twanging, echoing eternity over Jeff Linsenmaier's militaristic drums. Grant croons with heart-stopping authority and the chorus lifts off like a child's lost, melancholy balloon.</p><p>
    
    Nothing else on the album quite touches that tingling peak, but the record is full of ideas and unique arrangements, smothering the credible soft-rock of ""The Hymn"" with ghostly harmonies and spacey electronics and leaping into electro-prog territory on ""I Am the Man"", with Grant ceding his humanity to a vocoder over hammering drums and squealing synth. ""Trash"" bursts into a ridiculous bout of fretboard fireworks with guest guitarist Richard Odell spouting off ""Eruption"" style, while ""Pain"" rocks in more of a Euro-indie fuzz vein. And then there's the stunning ""Little Pink House"", a jazz burner stuffed with trumpet and fat piano chords, both guest Julie Monley and Grant singing straight from their guts.</p><p>
    
    The Czars are, in short, an impressive band with a handle on how to properly synthesize a plethora of strong influences. Though it has its moments of excess (really, that ""Trash"" solo is a bit overboard), <i>Goodbye is a luxurious album of subtle, exactingly crafted pop that's easy to come back to.</i></p></div>"|1708.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1708-goodbye/|7.8|Joe Tangari

In the case of Okay, the pseudonym for one-man band Marty Anderson, once you've learned he suffers from a strain of Crohn's disease and is more or less house- and IV-bound, the urge arises to hear his twin debuts, <i>Low Road</i> and <i>High Road</i>, as expressions of his medical condition, perhaps even as meditations on encroaching mortality. Even the moniker Okay sounds like a playful comment on his condition, a response to so many inquiries about his health.

He draws from disparate sources, structuring some songs as hymns (""Replace"" rewrites ""Amazing Grace"") and others as epics in miniature complete with chorales of kazoos (he plays what sounds like a blade of grass on ""Sing-along""). His vocals initially can be disorienting and potentially offputting: With its insectoid pitch, his voice sounds as if it's been digitally altered to protect his identity.

<p>Anderson builds these 22 songs as carefully calibrated contraptions, fitting together guitar, keyboard, drums or drum machine, handclaps, and whatever other sound satisfies his whim until the sprockets all click into place. This approach gives ""Now"", ""Compass"", and ""We"" a toylike self-propulsion, as if Anderson has simply wound them up and set them to wander around his home studio. But just as he puts these songs together, he also takes them apart: On ""Roman"", ""Devil"", and the instrumental ""Up"" he sets the gears to grind against each other until the songs fall apart in a mechanical cacophony.

<p>Sonically, <i>Low</i> and <i>High Road</i> are more or less identical, but thematically, they are as different as their titles suggest. <i>Low Road</i> is the more pessimistic of the two, gloomily fatalistic and often darkly humorous, especially ""Hoot"", on which Anderson sings ""there's always going to be a war...each and every one of us is a whore."" <i>High Road</i> is slightly more hopeful, but guardedly so; On ""Good"" Anderson sings, ""Look for the good/And find the good"" over and over like a recovery mantra. <i>High Road</i> is perhaps just a little more streamlined and engaging than <i>Low Road</i>, its pop elements more focused toward a holistic effect.</p>
<p>It's tempting to read these albums as evocations of the afterlife, <i>Low Road</i> leading to damnation and <i>High Road</i> to redemption with Anderson and all of us at the crossroads. And while these two sides of his Okay persona interact dynamically and complicate these albums' relationship to each other, reducing them to expressions of his medical condition ignores the complexities of his seemingly simple lyrics and constrains the music to merely one meaning.

One is radio exposure. There've been major and minor U.S. dancehall hits since forever, from Shabba to Shaggy to Beanie. But the last few years have been a golden age for dancehall on the radio, as both ""Diwali"" and ""Coolie Dance"" ignited riddim mania for the first time in the U.S. The other is CD compilations, especially Greensleeves' <i>Biggest Dancehall Anthems</i> and <i>Ragga Ragga Ragga</i> series. The 2003 editions of both are among the best records released in the new millennium, accurately reflecting what a great year it was for dancehall. But, for me, 2004's editions failed to catch fire. Was something rotten in the state of dancehall?</p><p>
    
    Well, yes and no. Both CDs lacked the same number of exciting riddims as their 2003 counterparts. But, if you managed to dig through even a bit of the yearly mudslide of JA-only singles and one-riddim albums, you'd find beats (""Bubble Up"", ""Dancehall Rock"") that slew the immediately canonized ones. So, yes, it's foolish to attribute a creative slump to the licensing capabilities of a single label. But since most of you are A) American, B) not hardcore dancehall fans, and C) employed at least part-time, compilations it is. And to judge by 2005's RX3, the dilettantes are facing an even sketchier crop.</p><p>
    
    Most of my annoyance with current dancehall stems from the continued influence of soca. Soca, for those who don't know, is the preferred Carnival soundtrack for many Caribbean nations. To the naked, untrained ear, soca seems close to dancehall, the way your grandma would hear no difference between Aesop Rock and Paul Wall. But soca is, if nothing else, faster than dancehall. Fast enough to make the LCD examples of it sound like cranked-up cruise ship commercials. Soca does have its more ""innovative"" aspects like a submerged bhangra influence that's surely had a little to do with dancehall's own far east fetishism. But, as artists like TOK began to mix up soca with their hardcore boy band ragga, they set in motion dancehall's current fascination with hypa-hypa 120bpm dance craze tunes.</p><p>
    
    Call me a fun-hating old crank, but a lot of this stuff is really goddamn annoying. Worst offender here is Macka Diamond's ""Lexus &amp; Benz"". Not only does it feature the de rigeur spastic oompah oompah beat, but includes...wait for it...a banjo. Really fast ""Hee-Haw"" banjo. I'm sorry but this is whimsy gone too far. Other subpar tracks include Voicemail (wtf), Delly Ranks, and Bogle's ""Weh Di Time"", another ""do the yardie Mashed Potato"" tune. (I should take a second here to say RIP to Bogle, who was like Bez crossed with MJ in his prime and something like a national deity. His death is the only reason I feel iffy dissing all the dance craziness here.) Macka Diamond's ""Mr. Teki Back"" has an annoying brapp-brapp military beat. (As does Sizzla's ""I'm With the Girls"".) Then that fucking banjo shows up again on Beenie's ""Dance To the Chakka"". Could we have more Junior Byles and less Junior Samples, please?</p><p>
    
    But, as per Jamaica's per annual output, there are gems here. Beenie's ""Ziggy Zung"" is a soca-styled track that works, mostly due to the inclusion of the line ""Peter Peter pum pum eater."" Vybz Kartel's ""Dutty Panty"" is a nicely clonking old school groove with a bizarre injunction against sheer undies. On the other side of sanity, Vybz's ""Spragga Connection"" is a virulent diss track originally titled, uh, ""Faggot Correction"". You can hear the knot of tension forming in his neck as he (literally) spits the foul line about Foxy Brown pissing in Spragga's face. Mad Cobra's ""Switch"" answers my thwarted request post-""Allo Allo"" for a dancehall track with an accordion, plus a clanging submarine alarm which I didn't ask for, but what they hey.</p><p>
    
    Beenie Man's ""Three Laws"" is bleep and bass played at 140bpm, and with another argument against an oral sex contract in the mutual interest. (Really fellas, it ain't gonna bite you.) Vybz's ""School Bus"" has a vaguely eastern synth drone and avalanche drums with Vybz sagely advising the youth not to have sex on the bus but to instead study chemistry and ProTools. And who says ragga's all amoral gunplay and fassy bashing?</p></div>"|2082.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2082-ragga-ragga-ragga-2005/|6.7|Jess Harvell

    in perpetual December, it won't do you much good now. Go outside.
    Secondly, the only reason I say it's a winter record is because I
    can't think of any other time when anyone would tolerate its
    relentless grousing. Styrofoam have always put forth a sort of wistful
    glitch-hop, but </i><i>Nothing's Lost elevates the mope to an art form. They
    implement a policy of Leave No Platitude Behind with enough conviction
    to sustain the record for about four bars; then you realize the
    striking similarities between this LP 's over-dodged Notwist-style
    lap pop and, um, Linkin Park. We don't even need an audibly
    breath-controlled verse from guest emcee Alias to tell us that.</i></p><p>
    
    The list of other guest appearances here reads like a who's-who of post-glitch lap-pop: Postal Service and Death Cab star Ben Gibbard not only provides vocals but contributes music to several tracks as well. Andrew Kenny of American Analog Set and Valerie 
    Trebeljahr of Lali Puna also take turns on the mic, and Notwist/Lali Puna leader Markus Acher pitches in on guitar.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Misguided"" is an inauspicious dud, leaving Styrofoam to scrape
    himself off the ground. He manages, just barely. The rest of
    <i>Nothing's Lost nine tracks carom from fuzzy-wuzzy IDM to rain-soaked
    shoegazer and often dwell in the spacious grey area between
    half-digested genres. No other track is as vapid as ""Misguided"", but
    the opener puts Styrofoam at a deep disadvantage, from which he
    never quite recovers.</i></p><p>
    
    ""Ticket Out of Town"" is one big long sloppy 80s college rock guitar
    solo swamped in white noise and an overbearingly busy beat. It's an
    interesting concept, but Styrofoam has trouble deciding which
    elements to give preference and it never coagulates. Ben Gibbard
    guests on ""Couches in Alleys"", a song which miraculously finds a way
    to make the Postal Service frontman sound even more precious than his
    own band's protocol. ""Front to Back"" takes a slithery, Moby-style beat
    and wrings all the bathetic juices out of it, finding peace by
    propulsion. Incidentally, the record's most upbeat track is also its
    strongest. Sporting a beeline dance beat and an anthemic chorus,
    ""Anything"" explores the flipside of Styrofoam's typically frowning
    approach. Maybe it's unfair that we excuse cornstarch more readily
    when it's bright and beaming than when it's downtrodden, but Styrofoam
    should keep the prejudice in mind.</p><p>
    
    Whereas five years ago it might have seemed novel, hacking
    conventional songwriting with CPU's and lacing it with twitchy
    synthetic beats is old hat. But Styrofoam isn't at fault for trying
    to do something new and failing--he's guilty of a shoddy
    translation job. <i>Nothing's Lost attempts to superimpose traditional
    pop formats onto a digitally-enhanced and -metamorphosed aesthetic.
    Postal Service succeed by paring down-- they're lo-fi for the G5 era.
    L'Altra and Notwist are pop wizards masquerading as techies. Not even
    Pope Benedict XVI, meanwhile, knows what's happening beneath Dntel's
    beautiful textures, but who cares? Styrofoam, by comparison, has no
    singular strength. </i><i>Nothing's Lost is a well-meaning record that just
    got its priorities mixed up. These tech'd-up tearjerkers can
    out bench press anyone in terms of sonic fodder, but the album is
    whiny, transparent, and a colossal hodgepodge.</i></p></div>"|7546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7546-nothings-lost/|3.3|Sam Ubl

That
    might seem like a big statement for such a small record, but rewind a
    decade:
    
    That's me, there, in a ""Welcome to the Inland Empire""
    silk-screened Shrimper tee, unwashed hair, and horn-rimmed glasses,
    obsessing over the Mountain Goats' <i>The Hound Chronicles cassette while stacking loaves of bread
    at a Southern New Jersey convenience store. Every night I'd steal a Snapple
    and drive home through the pines and deer alleys in my broken Chevy
    Impala with the windows down, blasting the Mountain Goats, Paste,
    Nothing Painted Blue (or whatever), on my tiny portable boom box.</i></p><p>
    
    That teenage idealism followed me to college, too, when I gave the
    by-then hard-to-find <i>Hot Garden Stomp</i> cassette to a friend because he
    carried a picture of John Darnielle in his wallet-- I felt
    he deserved it. For years, the Mountain Goats' <i>Sweden</i> was my
    main signifier for that country. Whenever I saw the Swedish flag, I'd
    hum ""The Recognition Scene"". But as 2000 rolled around, I'd
    forgotten Darnielle existed. (Actually, in a way I thought he'd
    transformed himself into Rick Moody, or they were somehow a ghost-writing tag team.)</p><p>
    
    My general loss of interest isn't meant to dismiss or simplify
    Darnielle's accomplishments.
    It's just that after memorizing the shivers induced by ""the most
    remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway is that it's you
    and that you are standing in the doorway"" perhaps I've already
    experienced the apex of Darnielle's poetics at my own personal ideal
    time/place. I no longer even own a car or a boom box and I rarely
    steal iced tea from the local bodega.</p><p>
    
    And no, I'm not a low-fi purist, so it doesn't at all bother me that
    he's upped the production. In fact,
    the accompaniment of Peter Hughes, John Vanderslice, Franklin Bruno,
    Scott Solter, and <i>Maldoror</i> fan Erik Friedlander open things up here
    (as on his last few records), allowing Darnielle more space to take
    some breaths, work on atmosphere, introduce catchy piano trills, some distorted grinding noises, and
    cello swells.</p><p>
    
    But yet my first few listens to <i>The Sunset Tree</i>, the Mountain Goats' third
    4AD full-length and follow-up to last year's <i>We Shall All Be Healed</i>,
    left me cold, even though Darnielle axes his fictions and explores his own personal life, specifically an
    abusive stepfather.</p><p>
    
    As one would hope from a songwriter as smart as Darnielle, ""The
    Sunset Tree"" comes from a 19th-century religious song, ""The Tyrolese
    Evening Hymn"" and as reported in Pitchfork news some time ago,
    ""Darnielle says he took it from a scene in Samuel Butler's
    semi-autobiographical novel <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>, where a clergyman
    beats his young son bloody because of a speech impediment that
    prevents the son from enunciating clearly while singing the hymn.""
    Still, even as said stepdad chucks a glass at mom's head and young JD
    runs up into his room to hide the shouts with dance music, the
    familiar staccato of those comforting cadences lulled instead of
    enlightened.</p><p>
    
    Something I subconsciously learned when I was younger that I'm just now understanding is that the Mountain Goats' sound best after obsessively replaying each track until they become as familiar as your own personal memories. Accordingly, after a thousand and one listens,  while I can still do without much of the
    second half of <i>The Sunset Tree</i>, on its first four songs Darnielle
    locates a stride, crafting a perfect four-part diorama. It's quite an
    accomplishment.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""You Or Your Memory"" is a lonely motel-room, bare-foot
    epiphany fueled by St. Joseph's baby aspirin, Bartles &amp; Jaymes,
    and a mirror. ""Broom People"" develops the domestic scenery for the
    album's drama: '36 Hudson in the garage, junk in an unattached spare
    room, ""white carpet thick with cat hair,"" dirty dishes, lots of ice
    cream in the freezer, ""friends who don't have a clue/ Well-meaning
    teachers,"" suicide notes in a spiral-ring notebook, and the girl who
    makes him feel alive: ""In the long tresses of your hair I am a
    babbling brook.""</p><p>
    
    With a fast-car thematic that's an odd collision between Tracy Chapman's urgency and the romanticism of Jawbreaker's ""Chesterfield King""-- and
    brandishing the triumphant chorus, ""I'm gonna make it through this
    year if it kills me""-- ""This Year"" finds 17-year-old Darnielle breaking
    free from his ""broken house"" on a Saturday morning to play video games ""in a drunk haze""
    while holding hands with a girl named Kathy. Of course, teenage
    celebrations come to an end: ""I drove home in the California dusk/ I
    could feel the alcohol inside of me hum/ Pictured the look on my
    stepfather's face/ Ready for the bad things to come.""</p><p>
    
    Then there's the wonderful ""Dilaudid"", a coil of nervous energy and
    teenage thrill-seeking. Darnielle's backed by a full-on string crew
    and the bows are used in a quick/jaunty way, matching the machine-gun
    rate of hi claustrophobic and creepy salvos (i.e. teen horniness
    fueled by pain killers): ""Hike up your fishnets, I know you. If we
    live to see the other side of this, I will remember your kiss, so do
    it with your mouth open. And take your foot off of the brake, for
    Christ's sake.""</p><p>
    
    After that, besides a cleaning-out-my-closet sing-a-long ""Up the Wolves"", <i>The Sunset Tree</i> loses steam. The late-period references to Kurt Cobain's suicide feel cheap and easy. Pieces of it go by unnoticed. Bits either blend
    into one another or wander. Oddly, at times it seems like Darnielle works more movingly and astutely when he's inventing his tales rather than partaking in personal anecdote and/or trauma. Then again, invention often possesses a more beautiful narrative arc than retreating to your bedroom to block out a parental argument.
    
    Really, though that first quartet is a wonderful example of what Darnielle
    can do when he's on-- draw characters and
    plot better than just about anyone holding a guitar.</p></div>"|5456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5456-the-sunset-tree/|7.2|Brandon Stosuy

While listening to this handsome new studio recording of the piece, however, it's a little difficult to understand what exactly caused all the hubbub, as longtime Zorn aficionados are unlikely to even consider this to be one of his more confrontational or difficult works.</em></p><p>
    
    Conducted here by Brad Lubman, <em>Rituals is billed as an operatic monodrama in five movements for mezzo-soprano and 10 instruments. As with other recent Zorn works like 2002's <i>IAO</i> and last year's <i>Magick</i></em>, the piece draws inspiration from the abstruse, mystical writings of Aleister Crowley, although <em>Rituals includes no libretto as such. In practice, this lack of lyrics serves to enhance the music's captivating, luminous intrigue, and heighten its mysterious incantatory energies.</em></p><p>
    
    Short in length, <em>Rituals is dense and focused, a model of understated restraint that contains none of Zorn's notorious interjections of thrash or noise. It's mezzo-soprano Heather Gardner who delivers what is the album's most immediately arresting performance. In what sounds to be an extremely physically demanding role, Gardner sails through the piece's wordless, meditative vocal cascades with power and grace. Throughout these five movements she provides just the right degree of opaque emotion, as Zorn cagily leaves it to the listener to decide if her impassioned calls are of agony, ecstasy, or some progression between the two.</em></p><p>
    
    Constructing a backdrop behind Gardner's vocals is a motley ensemble of woodwinds, strings and percussion, and the group's inquisitive, nimble footwork is frequently reminiscent of Zorn's hero Carl Stalling. This is particularly true in the case of multi-tasking percussionist Jim Pugliese, whose wide-ranging duties here almost make him resemble a foley artist for an old-time radio drama. Utilizing such esoteric instruments as wind machines, bull-roarers, fishing reels, ""grave-digging,"" and bird calls-- for what mystical, alchemical purposes one can only speculate-- Pugliese provides <em>Rituals with a considerable portion of its toothsome, perplexing drama.</em></p><p>
    
    Clocking in at just over 20 minutes yet carrying the price tag of a full-length CD, <em>Rituals is not likely to find many fans among bargain hunters. Neither will it hold much appeal for stuffy opera traditionalists or those who aspire to their ranks. But for established Zorn enthusiasts, </em><em>Rituals is replete with moments to confound, enrich and delight, and will surely lure you to its darkened altar for frequent repeat ceremonies.</em></p></div>"|8932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8932-rituals/|7.5|Matthew Murphy

Our media have shied away from calling it that, preferring the word genocide, which certainly applies, and the rather loathsome euphemism ""ethnic cleansing,"" a term I've always thought inadequate and much too polite for confronting human savagery at its worst. It is a war, though, separate from the decades-long fight that engulfed the southern half of Sudan until the signing of a peace agreement earlier this year, but similar to that conflict in that the totalitarian Sudanese central government has responded to local black African unrest with a coordinated campaign of destruction, allowing Arab militias known as Janjaweed carte blanche to burn, pillage, kill, and expel, even in areas where no uprising exists. The express purpose of the campaign, which is indisputably backed by the Sudanese regular military, is to erase Darfur's black African (I refer to them as opposed to the country's Arab population-- Sudan has a complicated ethnic and religious composition owing to its colonial background) population and their homes along with them.</p><p>
    The resulting human flight from Darfur has brought thousands of refugees to neighboring Tchad, a nation in no financial or material shape to accommodate them, and various camps within Sudan, where they survive thanks mostly to international largesse. Without foreign eyes, it's likely that Sudan would simply press its offensive and proceed with its naked genocide-- unfortunately, the interest of foreign governments is fickle, and a brief outcry in the halls of the UN has devolved into ineffectual grandstanding and squabbling over how best to address the situation. Of course, the delicacy of governments like ours in dealing with the Khartoum regime is at least partially driven by interest in the oil resources that government controls, and it's left up to non-governmental organizations to provide aid, food and shelter for a massive displaced populace in a part of the world\xD0the eastern fringe of the Sahara-- not known for its hospitable conditions.</p><p>
    This background established, <i>ASAP: The Afrobeat Sudan Aid Project</i> is a compilation aimed at providing funds for the sundry organizations involved in Darfur relief, and all proceeds from its sale go directly to the cause, with no profit to any of the parties involved-- the artists, Modiba Productions, Ben Cohen's True Majority and Apple's iTunes store, the latter two being the discs's exclusive distributors (True Majority offers the disc at its website, iTunes obviously offers a download). As the reviewer, I'll say up front that this is a charitable cause I believe in and that in my opinion the donation would be worth making regardless of the contents of the disc. The rating up top reflects perhaps a bit of that conviction on my part, but this caveat is almost unnecessary-- this compilation is solid from any perspective and represents a fine introduction to the modern descendants of the 1970s Afropop.</p><p>
    It's a truly multinational mix, with performers from the U.S., Africa, and Europe, most of whom have called multiple continents home at some point in their lives. The American contingent revolves around New York City's modern Afrobeat orchestras, Antiabalas, Kokolo, and Akoya, and all have donated spectacular tracks for the cause. Antibalas offers a smoking live version of ""Uprising"" full of maniacal sax solos and burbling neo-Africa 70 rhythms, while Akoya's ""USA"" is a striking denouncement of unilateralism with a huge horn arrangement and a great vocal from Kaleta, an Afrobeat veteran who's recorded with both Fela Kuti and Fela's son Femi. Kokolo's two tracks are both excellent: ""Mister Sinister"" careens over whiplash horns into a dub midsection and ""More Consideration"" does something lyrically that almost no funk or Afrobeat ever does, lamenting the inequality of women in cultures the world over.</p><p>
    The African artists, most of whom were born in Nigeria and are now based in the U.S., contribute songs in a wide array of styles, most of which are actually less indebted to Fela than their American counterparts.  Ikwunga's ""Di Bombs"" is spoken poetry with a chugging Afrobeat backing, Ikwunga intoning evenly and calmly, ""Di jets di jets/ Di jets are built in Germany/ But the air raids are for Freetown/ The air raids are for Asmara."" Keziah Jones offers up thumping r&amp;b; on ""Garan Garan,"" with an ultra-simple bass and drum groove backing up his vocal, which is based on an old Nigerian folk tune. Dele Sosimi and Franck Biyong &amp; Massak each throw down monstrous slabs of deep Afrogroove, but the biggest revelation here might be Wumni, whose hyperkinetic dance track ""What a See"" is tailor-made for a post-M.I.A. world. She dives sweating into a sumptuous beat with rubbery rapping and spastic scatting for a result that's stunning and difficult to classify.</p><p>
    For good measure, there's even a classic mid-70s Tony Allen track (""Progress"") to sweeten the deal, though by the time it shows up in the tracklisting, the disc has already proved its worth several times over. Like most charity releases, there's little direct relevance in most of these songs to what's happening in Darfur (the remix of Akoya Afrobeat Ensemble's ""Star Wars"" features samples from news reports on Darfur, and that's the only explicit mention), but unlike most charity releases, this has a cohesion and singularity of purpose that make it very listenable in one sitting. The way I see it, there are two reasons to check this out: First, it's a phenomenal introduction to current Afropop, and second, it's for a good cause. You don't often get to vote your conscience by buying a good record, so this gets my wholehearted recommendation.</p></div>"|2081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2081-asap-the-afrobeat-sudan-aid-project/|8.0|Joe Tangari

They may have a new band name 
    (Supersystem) and a new record label (Touch &amp; Go), but in 
    spite of some personnel shuffling (mainly the addition of drummer Joshua 
    Blair, making them a quartet), they still take the same approach: 
    merging rousing D.C.-punk anthems and dance music, and yielding mixed 
    results.</p><p>
<i>Always Never Again makes me think the band has a convincing 
    dance record in them somewhere. The elements are there, and this album seems more full and maximalist than <em>Supersystem</em> or <em>Fake French</em>. 
    But on like those earlier records, Supersystem here manage to shoot themselves 
    in the foot before the party ever gets going.</i></p><p>
    
    El Guapo's round-style harmonies were a point of contention, and they're still here on <em>Always Never Again</em>. I don't 
    consider clever lyrics a requirement in either dance or rock, but 
    these are distractingly inane. After a Ratatattin' video-game music 
    intro, second track ""Everybody Sings"" repeats the same trick as <em>Fake 
    French</em>'s ""Just Don't Know"", repeating one phrase ad infinitum, 
    interspersing different nouns (""Do you feel the connection to people on the 
    surface?/ Do you feel the connection between people in the office?""), 
    hoping to find meaning by accident. And after listening to previous single ""Born Into the World"" (""I 
    was born above a candy store/ Behind a great big marble door""), I'm 
    pretty sure they're making the words up as they go along</p><p>
    
    But more than that, Supersystem want you to get down to their 
    punk-funk hybrid so badly, they use every trick they have, on every track, all 
    at once. It's the execution that bogs the record down; it lacks subtlety, tension, or surprise. The sax on ""Click Click"" is a nice 
    touch-- as are the chilly keyboards on ""Born Into the World"" or the 
    violins and Cure-inspired phased guitar on ""Miracles"". But then the vocals come in, and manic 
    layering of instruments and beats continues without any kind of melodic 
    variation. As a result, tracks like ""Defcon"", with a decent 
    beat and solid drive, are weighted down by clutter. There are Latin rhythms and tones 
    popping up in tracks like ""Six Cities"" and ""The Love Story"", but that's 
    really the only step Supersystem has made from their former namesake-- 
    if you didn't like <i>Fake French</i>, nothing here will change your 
    mind.</p></div>"|7810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7810-always-never-again/|4.9|Jason Crock

He's only three years younger than me, but that means that in 2001, when he made <em>In Moll</em>, his solo debut on Kompakt, he was only 20. Twenty!</p><p>
    
    Sure, <em>In Moll</em> was rather shameless Gas worship. (Gas being the drowsy Arcadian ambient project of Kompakt founder Wolfgang Voigt.) It shared Voigt's love of soft-focus, gently chugging house beats (nicked from Chain Reaction and then dusted down with baby powder and packed in gauze) and synths with plenty of vaseline on the mix. What it lacked was Voigt's overall denseness of massed orchestral samples (his synth equivalent) that made GAS records like Pop such an overwhelming yet wombing experience. (Number one bedtime album, 2000 to present.) <em>In Moll</em> was sparser, cleaner, and more pulse-based. It was also fucking gorgeous.</p><p>
    
    Well, I am pleased to report that four years on very little has changed. Guentner still sounds like he's happy exploring ever more subliminal notes in an unending wash of hyper-sustained synth chords. The beats again sound as if they're moving through a tarpit made of cotton candy. The only major deviation is ""Hi-Jacked"", a sludgly, mid-tempo shuffle that only stands out because it approaches actual music amidst its narcotized surroundings. The rest is a million shades of shimmer, crackle, and pulse.</p><p>
    
    Wait, <i>am</i> I pleased? There's a fine line between exploring a set range of sounds or a delineated mood, and out-and-out self-parody. Guentner hasn't crossed it yet, but Kompakt and contemporaries have pretty steadily horsewhipped the idea of 21st century new age over successive <i>Pop Ambient</i> comps, full lengths, the wine bar at the back of Hard Wax (the password is ""strudel""), etc. Guentner is capable of more: check his breezy proto-Junior Boys remix of Coloma's ""Summer Clothes"" for proof. In another four years, I hope he's raided some Germanic garage sales for leftover vocals (I hear Superpitcher's got yards of them), beats with treads on them, whatever. In the meantime, take the above numerical rating as a sleepytime guide to a soundtrack for a good rest. With stuff like this, it's not a diss.</p></div>"|3586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3586-1981/|7.8|Jess Harvell

    bastard-mix like (and unlike) fellow countrymen Soulwax,
    counterbalancing any disinterest in the motherfucking remix with
    simply riskier selections. Even on dabbler discs, Hall &amp; Oates and War
    and De La can throw for damn hard loops, and yet they were all
    together on the duo's first Eskimo mix in 2000, ta-da.</p><p>
    Glimmers' <i>DJ-Kicks entry jams electro and rock and disco--
    era-deviant and occasionally generous, 18 good-to-great songs
    all impeccably beatmatched-- but the mix does seem somewhat tame
    next to their earlier recordings, not to mention recent </i><i>DJ-Kicks</i> spots from Chicken Lips and Erlend Øye. The furthest
    Glimmers wander from garage (and fake-garage), late 80s house, and
    throwback italo is into campier numbers such as Bis' cover ""Shack Up"" and
    choice gay disco cut Ragtyme's ""Fix It Man"". But even then, ""If your
    drain is clogged, I got something for the job"" is no ""don't pass out
    goin' down on me/ Or I'll wake you up with a mouthful of pee.""</p><p>
    Suum cuique, but for me the mix works infinitely better with less to
    prove and fewer to please-- and feels much more confident and
    listenable given the relative continuity of its constituent parts. My
    ""dilettantism blew its load six months ago"" riff is just hot air, I
    bet; let's just say I've enjoyed more streamlined tracklistings that
    play records or sell a sound rather than the 90-second-track, genre-challenging pissing contests celebrated (it seems) simply for existing.</p><p>
    Love the 'roid ragers-- Idjut Boys' edit of Bohannon's ""The Boogie
    Train"", Kerri Chandler's garage-to-deephouse timewarp ""Disco
    Satisfaction"", Kaos' ""Feel Like I Feel (Sing Along)"" (faster here, and
    more awesome with every listen)-- but respect the team players too,
    especially heavy dubs like Big Two Hundred's ""Approach And Pass With
    Contact"" and Lindstrøm's ""Kosmisk Klubbkveld"". And yet tracks this
    strong the Glimmers let stand alone and never merely as set-ups,
    perhaps reinforcing the mix's spine at the expense of a few
    dance-is-boring, give-me-pop whimperers.</p><p>
    I'm afraid I never really ""got"" Two Lone Swordsmen, nor have I ever
    appreciated the permanent aux percussion cocktease that is Rub N Tug's
    overglorified reedit of Chicago's ""I'm a Man"", so in my mind the
    Glimmers finish up a bit backwards. At the end I'm left with two
    impressions. First, I respect the duo's relative selflessness. They
    keep the focus on the tracks and tell a good post-garage story.
    Second, ""this is good electro-house-disco mix, but I can't really tell it
    apart from the billion others I've heard.""</p></div>"|3673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3673-dj-kicks/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

And sometimes, a band would even go back into the studio, cut more tracks, and include those on singles. Alas, what Interpol brings to the making of their albums ends up on the album-- the only non-radio-session, non-remix track on these three EPs is ""Song Seven"", a track that's been around since before the days of <i>Turn on the Bright Lights</i>. And, ""Song Seven"", unsurprisingly, is An Interpol Song-- morose, romantic, glistening, propulsive, yadda yadda. Put it on either album, and it blends right in. Put it on an EP pimping an album track, and it begs the question, ""Well, gee, it's nice and all, but why can't you guys include more originals on your singles?""</p>
<p>So what you, Interpol Fan, are left with, should you decide to purchase (or download) these EPs, are the one non-album original, six remixes, and three radio session tracks. The session tracks, available on the <i>Evil</i> EP, are from a Zane Lowe BBC Session. Unfortunately, none of Lowe's spastic nic-fitted chatter is included-- instead, it's just the music. Two songs from <i>Antics</i> (""NARC"", and, of course, ""Evil"") and ""Leif Erikson"" are essayed during this session. ""Leif Erikson"" (the Radio Session) sounds quite similar to ""Leif Erikson"" (the Album Track), so kudos to the group for that one. The Two <i>Antics</i> tracks, however, don't come off so well. If anything, they're prime evidence that producer Peter Katis should ask for more points when Interpol slips into Fairfield County to record that difficult third album. The performance of ""Evil"" in particular sounds rinky-dinky and wan , especially with the superior album version residing on the same disc.</p>
<p>The <i>Slow Hands</i> EP, the weak sister in this bunch, features two remixes of the titular track. Britt Daniel treats the track like a Spoon song, which means that each instrument is actually a Lego block to be added and subtracted from the structure as seen fit. In doing so, Daniel brings out the disco in the track, successfully replacing the original's pensive shuffle with a cocky strut. Dan the Automator, the other remixer, treats ""Slow Hands"" the way a fraternity treats freshman pledges. He pulls out the original drum track, throws in a turgid approximation of the live drums with a drum machine and a stiff boom-kick, adds some bloops, bleeps, and squiggles (because, hey, it's a remix), and cashes his paycheck. If the indie kids dance to this, then it's clear they haven't learned a damn thing. Hope there's still time to cancel payment.</p>
<p>That leaves the third and final EP, for <i>C'Mere</i>, the most straightforward (and, in my book, the best) track from the album. For this, each member of the band takes on an <i>Antics</i> track and does some rejiggering. Whether you read anything into the descriptions of these remixes and the member's contributions to the band is your own bag. Lead singer Paul Banks eschews the dance aspects of Interpol's sound, turning ""NARC"" into a spacious and specious solo performance, featuring a chord played ever five seconds, and Banks' voice smothered meekly in the background. Thankfully, the other three 'Polsters don't make the same mistake. Guitarist (and group founder) Daniel Kessler adds excessive pinging, ponging, and warping sounds to the track-- on first blush, it sounds like the work of a guy that just got ahold of the <i>Come To Daddy</i> EP. It's a grower, though, if you can get past the bucephalus bouncing ball in the introduction. Noted lothario Carlos D. takes on ""Public Pervert"" (ha ha ha), accentuating the sex by adding a slinky slow disco vibe to the track. And, of course, with Carlos D. being the group's bass player, there is plenty of focus on the bass.</p>
<p>I would play the Sounds Like New Order (In a Good Way) card on Carlos' effort, but I'm saving those kudos for ""Fog Vs. Mould for the Length of Love"". That's Fog as in drummer Samuel Fogarino (the group's secret weapon), and Mould as in Bob Mould, an up-and-coming DC-area DJ best know for the monthly DJ event (Blowoff) he co-hosts. (Mould's also done a little guitar playing for some bands-- I'd drop names, but y'all know how to Google, or browse your iPods.) Fog &amp; Mould stretch the love length out to nearly eight minutes, dropping in and out of the track expertly, with the new polyrhytmic backbeat pushing things forward.

Lead singer Paul Banks eschews the dance aspects of Interpol's sound, turning ""NARC"" into a spacious and specious solo performance, featuring a chord played ever five seconds, and Banks' voice smothered meekly in the background. Thankfully, the other three 'Polsters don't make the same mistake. Guitarist (and group founder) Daniel Kessler adds excessive pinging, ponging, and warping sounds to the track-- on first blush, it sounds like the work of a guy that just got ahold of the <i>Come To Daddy</i> EP. It's a grower, though, if you can get past the bucephalus bouncing ball in the introduction. Noted lothario Carlos D. takes on ""Public Pervert"" (ha ha ha), accentuating the sex by adding a slinky slow disco vibe to the track. And, of course, with Carlos D. being the group's bass player, there is plenty of focus on the bass.</p>
<p>I would play the Sounds Like New Order (In a Good Way) card on Carlos' effort, but I'm saving those kudos for ""Fog Vs. Mould for the Length of Love"". That's Fog as in drummer Samuel Fogarino (the group's secret weapon), and Mould as in Bob Mould, an up-and-coming DC-area DJ best know for the monthly DJ event (Blowoff) he co-hosts. (Mould's also done a little guitar playing for some bands-- I'd drop names, but y'all know how to Google, or browse your iPods.) Fog &amp; Mould stretch the love length out to nearly eight minutes, dropping in and out of the track expertly, with the new polyrhytmic backbeat pushing things forward. And, not unintentionally, the bookending sets of crackling static give the affair a white label mystique. Hola, Hacienda! Just remember, kids-- know your pills, buddy up, and drink plenty of water.</p></div>"|11761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11761-slow-hands-evil-cmere/|7.2|David Raposa

More on that in a second. First, Brazilian Girls, who are not actually Brazilian girls: They got their start in a club, and it shows: This stuff is all laid-back groove, with the usual transcontinental chic, easy-going house beats, and multilingual flourishes. But the club they came gliding out of is situated in downtown Manhattan, where the vibe these days is pretty far from VIP-lounge martini toasts. That fact goes a long way toward pegging what's special about them-- because no matter how much these immaculate grooves peek at glittery highlife, they're washed in such an earthy stoner vibe that they tend to wind up someplace else.</p><p>
    
    So one track sounds like something to bump on the way to the club, and the next is a sunny lazybones dub number with a chorus that runs ""Pussy pussy pussy, marijuana."" Suddenly you realize that this stuff would charm the dreadlocked southern boys at Bonnaroo as much as designer-chic folk and arty brown-skinned girls. Universality! That's how we come back to this adulthood thing. You can throw this band in with a lot of current acts, but the vibe they've wound up resurrecting might have more to do with the stuff adult sophisticates were chilling out to in the late 80s. What might sound like Zero 7 actually sounds more like Sade, and when this crew is really on the ball you get flashes of insight: So <i>this</i> is how cool Paul Simon used to sound to 30-year-olds.</p><p>
    
    If nothing else, they give us one unimpeachably great single, which in a long-gone sunny summer might have snuck up the charts like old-school Suzanne Vega. ""Don't Stop"" lets singer Sabina Sciubba work some slinky come-ons for a minute, the band combining live-groove keyboard feel with well-groomed beats. But when the chorus comes around, Sciubba starts skipping around her melody Simon-style, the band kicks it as sweet as a Phoenix single, and the whole thing blossoms into happy human basics: She just wants you to go to the park with her, maybe ""drink some tea and smoke some herb.""</p><p>
    
    And of course you would, because Sciubba is a total charm, with a deep warm voice and a knack for human-girl lyrics. Oddly enough, it's her come-ons and chants that falter: She's better off asking, ""When and how did I become my mother,"" or going all Sade on ""Long"" and describing time as ""longer than your hair in the 80s."" The same goes for the music. The stoned horns and super-sunny island turns on ""Pussy"" do tourism as well as Simon ever did, while other tracks put a warmer spin on the kind of slick Euro spook we used to get from Goldfrapp. But Mediterranean bumps like the one on ""Corner Store"" try a little too hard, and the group's stabs at crowd-pleasing funk just don't shine on record like their laid-back pop does.</p><p>
    
    Which leaves some of this material falling short of its peaks. One of the perks of being adult, though, is that you stop getting worked up about albums that won't be everything you want them to. A handful of winners, some respectable grooves, and a live show that has Sciubba dropping that line about her mother from underneath a blindfold: I'm good with this. Next time I visit my mom, will someone remind me to copy her Sade albums?</p></div>"|1156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1156-brazilian-girls/|7.3|Nitsuh Abebe

    recordings-- largely improvised, often cheesy keyboard/guitar
    ejaculations-- for fun and relaxation. My recording techniques leave a
    lot to be desired: Only two channels on my battered old Tascam
    four-track are still functioning, and you can often find me propping
    up a microphone right in front of a guitar amp or tiny, built-in
    keyboard speaker. I mention this because Dutch Dub (a solo project
    from Pretty Girls Make Graves' Nick deWitt) sounds a lot like one of
    the tapes piled in my closet.</p><p>
    
    So how can I take Dutch Dub to task if I'm guilty of the same thing?
    Simple: I'm not trying to sell you mine. Indie dudes doing side
    projects in genres other than their own is nothing new, but deWitt
    definitely made a poor choice for his ""dabbling genre."" This take on dub sounds like deWitt basically
    stripmined a cheapie Casio's tone bank, directly miking the speakers.
    If you know anything about dub, you know it goes as well with tinny
    recording as bubblegum does with popcorn.</p><p>
    
    Most modern listeners at least recognize dub in a
    ""know-it-when-we-hear-it"" sort of way, if only because of the genre's
    appropriation by Massive Attack, PiL, Pere Ubu; hell, even Sublime. A
    history of dub is uncalled for here, but it should be noted that production-- deep,
    echoing, cavernous, stark, drenched in reverb and delay-- is
    fundamental. Without it, you wind up with this: Monochromatic tones
    and repetitive rhythms running straight down the center of the mix,
    flat and affectless.</p><p>
    
    There are no highs and lows here-- although perhaps the songs with
    gruffly emotive, muffled vocals are slightly more interesting-- just
    an ongoing low-grade annoyance, as the album runs through seventeen
    tracks that manhandle dub with a caricaturist's eye. ""Heat Up"" is all
    canned drums and what sounds like a Fisher Price electric piano.
    Bursts of static stand in for echoing space on ""Dare to Dream""; 
    ""Dutch Waltz"" and many of its brethren could be mistaken for Nokia
    ringtones; ""Peanut Butter and Jelly Heart"" bleats and plinks into
    oblivion. Maybe deWitt's not ""serious"" about this record; maybe it's a
    tribute to kitsch or something. It's hard to tell, and even harder to
    care.</p></div>"|2605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2605-dutch-dub/|2.8|Brian Howe

Whereas most straight covers tend to remain either live-set whimsies or B-side obscurities (take John Mayer's ""Kid A""...or not), ivory-ticklers like Christopher O'Riley and Brad Mehldau have recorded not just one or two, but numerous Radiohead covers. This affinity doesn't seem too surprising, though, since the band is far more innovative musically than lyrically, and the sound of Yorke's vocals adds perhaps more tension and meaning to the lyrics than the words he sings. The band famously varies the complex meters, keys, structures, chord progressions, and tones of its songs, making them challenging workouts for musicians.</p>
<p>Two years after releasing his first covers album, <i>True Love Waits, </i>O'Riley returns with another batch, titled <i>Hold Me to This</i>. Compared to Mehldau, who often records as one member of a trio, O'Riley is something of a purist: His arrangements are strictly for solo piano, with no overdubs or guest musicians. These are impressionist covers, loosely translating rather than strictly transcribing tone and atmosphere into the more constrained setting. O'Riley fares best when his piano merely suggests a melody, as on ""The Tourist"" and ""No Surprises"". Conversely, bold melodic lines don't work very well. On ""Like Spinning Plates"", while one hand plays the low, rumbling pattern, the other bangs out the central melody in glaring chords that sound altogether out of place amid the subtler texture.</p>
<p>Culling material from every stage of Radiohead's career (although not necessarily in chronological order) into a particularly ambitious tracklist, he makes only a few obvious choices in songs: his ""Paranoid Android"" meanders even at a short five minutes, ""Sail to the Moon"" sounds like the instrumental track for the original, but ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"" makes an effective album closer. Not surprisingly, he picks no tracks from <i>Pablo Honey</i> or <i>Kid A</i>, which dominated <i>True Love Waits.</i> Instead, he selects three from 2003's underrated <i>Hail to the Thief</i>. Almost half of <i>Hold Me to This</i>, however, is devoted to B-sides, which reveals his fan's obsession behind this project. ""Polyethylene Part II"" moves from quiet to thunderous fluidly, while ""Talk Show Host"", from the <i>Romeo + Juliet</i> soundtrack (remember that?), draws the arresting four-note melody out for seven minutes.</p>
<p>Working out the complexities of Radiohead's textured music in a solo setting has its advantages-- a living-room intimacy among them-- but too often this constrained approach blurs the tracks together. Tonally, many of the songs on <i>Hold Me to This</i> often sound indistinguishable from each other, despite the range of source material. As a result, this album may end up as a novelty for Radiohead fans and perhaps a nonentity for everyone else.</p></div>"|6110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6110-hold-me-to-this-christopher-oriley-plays-radiohead/|6.2|Stephen M.

    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> Do you see? Yes? I'm referring to the object, though small in size, quite interesting in stature, I am holding in front of you now.
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> It's a CD.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> Brilliant! I can see I have come to the right man.
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> ...
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> Never one for suspense, I'll begin the next phase of our conversation: It is a new album from one of my country's most respected groups of musicians, Autechre.
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> Okay.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> And I am holding it in my hands.
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> Okay. Yeah, I heard a new one was coming out or something.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> Or something indeed, for I think it may be their best. Better even than the fine <i>Confield</i>. Do you remember the one?
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> Yeah, to be honest, I kinda stopped listening to them a few years back. I liked the first one, I think I liked <i>EP7</i>. I don't really remember much about it.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> I would happily grant you a very big favor in return for a moment of your time as I explain to you my thoughts on this record. Might you humor me?
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> Hey, hand that to me. Over here. Thanks. Yeah, whatever.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> Thank you. For starters, it's called <i>Untilted</i>. Isn't that funny? ""<i>Un-til-ted</i>."" They really do have a good sense of humor, don't you think?</p><p>
<em>Achilles:</em> Um, not really. It's kind of stupid.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> Well, I think it's a decent title all the same. But funnier still, I will admit, is that it's comprised of eight letters.
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> Oh shit, yeah, that's hilarious.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> Which is to say, funny when I recall that their previous album's title was also comprised of exactly eight alphanumeric characters (not counting the colon, of course). As was the full length before that-- <i>Confield</i>. Don't you think that's strange?
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> No.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> And even stranger still, Autechre-- A-U-T-E-C-H-R-E-- has the identical number of characters. Why, when I happened upon this, I was struck by the similarity in form.
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> Okay, way to go off the deep end. Are you going to tell me now that they're geniuses and I can learn trig faster by listening to them? I mean, what's funny is I might actually study to them more if I could hear a beat somewhere.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> As it happens, I do believe they are masters of form. But then I also believe they are as instinctively driven as any other musician, if that's not a contradiction (and I don't necessarily believe it is). Take ""Pro-Radii"", the third track: It begins with pounding, industrial-machinery sounds, as if stomping through a foggy alley using meter-thick blocks of iron as shoe souls. Yet, it slowly mutates into something lighter, with stuttering snare and what sounds like a digital sitar drone in the background.
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> You sound like a critic.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> And I haven't even gotten to the punchline! As it changes into something even further removed from the weighty opening, as eerie overtones ring above the pinging, metallic percussion, I realize the piece has arrived at this point in segments, lengthy and subtle, but obviously delineated to be sure. This, or course, is exactly the same scheme much of the dance music-- that with a ""beat""-- follows. Measure by measure, units of 8, 16, 32, 64-- it proceeds formally, yet changes its ""colors"" quite unpredictably.
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> Hey, hand me my bag.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> And the first piece, ""Lcc""--
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> haha
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> --""Lcc"", with its rapid-fire artillery precision, tight snare, and <i>clear, metered</i> rhythm, could easily be mistaken for dance music. In fact, I'd move some limbs for you, but would hate to influence your judgment negatively.
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> Next.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> Achilles, if you'd listen, you'd hear that the beat you are looking for is here, and an especially well-put-together one at that. Autechre are rightfully accused of being influenced by hip-hop, even as I imagine a rapper laying behind the beat might find himself on the wrong side of ""1"" from time to time.
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> So, you're saying it's got an interesting beat as long as you don't expect any kind of groove. And you know what? It's not even like I'm turning to Autechre for ""grooves."" Where the fuck did all the cool IDM even go? Like three years ago, you couldn't stop finding cool shit, shit that nobody'd ever heard before.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> I'm saying that interest is found where you are sufficiently motivated to look. ""Fermium"" would fit perfectly in the Berlin mix you made for your nephew. A little busier, perhaps, but...
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> Oh man, I forgot I was supposed to copy that for that board chick. Fuck, hey, can I use your computer? The library's closed today.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> The point is, despite their abstraction over the last few years, Autechre aren't an altogether different beast than when they started. In fact, they're smarter, more refined.
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> Look, I'll grant you they sound more complicated, but so the fuck what? I mean, I heard <i>Draft 7:30</i>. I liked it at first, until I realized all this form and content or whatever you're talking about is totally transparent. Dance music? Come on man, you need a more than ""beat"" to make dance music. If anything, I think they're out of ideas; throwing in a bunch of random shit to hide the fact that they peaked about seven years ago.
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> My point is, I am still moved by this music. Not just the form, not just the hidden beats and seemingly chaotic shifts in meter. I believe artists are those who instinctively recognize the ways of things, and translate them in ways ultimately true to their spirit. Ours is a ""seemingly chaotic"" world, but underneath the maze of people and opinions, there is order, truth, and beauty. And maybe, just maybe, Autechre have the rare gift of showing us just where we stand, turbulence and all.
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> And my point is, if it's driven by form, it's a pretty messy, lazy form-- certainly no more structurally sound than any other software wank music. On top of that, if I'm supposed to ""feel"" this, to pick up on some obscure metaphysical in-joke, I'm not-- isn't it the job of a good artist to make that shit clear? Either way, it fails for me. Autechre decided to go their own way, fine, you know, just don't expect me to call them ""geniuses.""
    </p><p><em>Tortoise:</em> [<i>Sigh</i>] Alright, Achilles, I can see we're going to have to agree to disagree. I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
    </p><p><em>Achilles:</em> Oh don't worry, dude, just wear headphones when you play that stuff.

Bearing little resemblance to the cuddly IDM of 2001's  <em>Start Breaking My Heart</em>, <em>Up in Flames</em> felt like the work of another  mind, and logic dictated that the project should have a different name.  The Gods of Music apparently agreed but were a little slow on the  uptake; finally sensing the marked shifts in tone and focus they sent  Handsome Dick Manitoba of the Dictators to smite the project. Papers  were served, a trade infringement lawsuit was threatened, and Caribou  was born.</p><p>  Bummer that the record racks of the world are going to get more  confusing, but in purely musical terms the name change isn't such a bad  thing. <em>The Milk of Human Kindness</em> sounds once again like an album from  a  band without a past, a band ready to take risks and go where the music  needs to go. The contrast between <em>The Milk of Human Kindness</em> and <em>Up in  Flames</em> is certainly less pronounced than the jump from the debut, but  the feel here-- clearer arrangements and better songs, both more  expansive and comparatively sober-- is new to Snaith.</p><p>  I should explain that when I say that Caribou sounds like a band  without a past, I mean a past of their own. Certain historical strands  from the last 35 years or so of rock are easy to discern. Where <em>Up in  Flames</em> referenced spiraling psychedelia, this record is more controlled,  carefully choosing its moments and arranging peaks for maximum impact.  The most obvious addition to the sound is a strong dose of Krautrock,  particularly the classic propulsion of Neu!</p><p>  The opening riff of ""Bees"",  for example, takes a handful of Booker T &amp; the MGs' ""Green Onions"" and  spreads them like flares along the Autobahn of ""Hallo Gallo"". That's  only the bedrock rhythm, and as the song progresses Snaith indulges his  fondness for dynamic builds and folds in a chorus of horns that lead to  a booming drum crescendo. ""A Final Warning"" is another strong motorik  beat and this time Snaith rides the efficient engine  through the kandy-kolored dreamland of the Boredoms' <em>Vision Creation  Newsun</em>, exploding from dark tunnels into a vast,  yawning  mother sky with a wailing ""Ahhh!!!!""</p><p>  The noisier tracks here are a lot of fun-- the  spazzy ""Brahminy Kite"" is all cymbal crash and tom roll, its martial pulse  and tinny organ contrasting with a repeating vocal refrain. The  flipside  of these drum-heavy tunes (which you know the band is aching to play  live) is ""Hello Hammerheads"", an upfront and folksy vocal where Snaith  aims for Simon and Garfunkel territory and winds up in the same area  code,  which is saying something considering how ""just another instrument"" his  crooning can be. Tying the various strands together are a well-crafted  series of minute-or-two interludes, which move from Lynchian  melodrama (""Subotnick"") to manipulated bits of warped baroque  (""Drumheller"").</p><p>  Some of the ""big"" tracks remind me of the gothic reconfigurations of DJ  Shadow, particularly the dramatic build-of-steam ""Pelican Narrows"",  with  its melancholy ""Theme From the Incredible Hulk"" piano theme and loose,  splashy drumbeat, but also the gangly interlude ""Lord Leopard"". The  Shadow feel is doubly interesting because, though Snaith is currently  leading a full band when out on tour, complete with two drummers, he  brings a record fan's approach to his music. He's digging into the past  to find the best bits and combining the new ways, reinforcing the idea,  suggested at on earlier Manitoba material, that his particular genius  is  curatorial rather than strictly inventive. However he does it, he's created another thrilling, excellent record.</p><p> </p></div>"|1805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1805-the-milk-of-human-kindness/|8.5|Mark Richardson

Like all genres, it's got its stylistic hallmarks: bass mutations, jungle breakbeats, and plenty of brazenly stolen samples. Other flavors-- embolism gabba, cock rock, Irish jigs-- come afterwards. It can be played absurdly fast or at hip-hop tempo. It can be silly, menacing, painful, or euphoric, but it's rarely soothing, sexy, or meditative.</p><p>
    
    Enduser is a breakcore artist by dint of association, but he's also released records on mainstream drum'n'bass don Dylan's Outbreak label. Dylan, and by extension Enduser, falls into the ""beat that shit with a spike fuckin bat"" school of jungle. And sure enough, there's plenty of spork-in-yr-earhole bass (some enterprising bedroom DJ should see about mashing up ""Dubplate #12"" with Lil Jon's ""What U Gon' Do"") and bronco rides across overmodulated snares of death.</p><p>
    
    But he finds wiggle room even within the most oppressive of templates. The titular characters of ""Dissin Monks"" chant along with the serrated beats, adding an almost comical atmosphere of gothic portentousness. ""Diggin Graves"" is thrombosis-hop, all pixilated 8-bit beat edits and a brittle, digital, chirruping loop that sounds like Mego's Pita gone funky. (I won't mention everyone Enduser samples on <em>Run War</em>, both to save his lawyer some work and to keep the spotters happy.)</p><p>
    
    Most amazingly, he reaches occasionally for real, traditional beauty. The immaculately turned out post-Aphex atmospherics of ""ESB Rmx"" are pretty gorgeous on their own. Then he adds a surging bassline that would be a balm on any junglist dancefloor. But he tops off with a yearning Bollywood vocal, possibly pitched up slightly to play on its essential Kanye chipmunkness. This is one of those aesthetic choices that separates genius from pretender.</p><p>
<em>Run War</em> isn't perfect. It falls apart a little in the home stretch as it veers sharply into gabba tempo, drill'n'bass beats, and general silliness. (This sort of post-Kid606 DSP abuse is common enough in breakcore to make me wary. Do we really need more tracks combining Destiny's Child + distorted 200bpm snare rushes?) But he rallies with ""Glock Dub"", a scowling take on (I think) the ""Scorpio"" break that's smacked about by some truly painful bass distortion.</p><p>
    
    On his blog recently, DJ/rupture castigated the post-jungle underground for its essentially conservative nature. Fair enough: I've certainly heard plenty of rote ""Amen"" + ragga over the last 12 months. But jungle's vocabulary is there to be used, as with 12-bar blues or the hip-hop breaks that inspired it in the first place.

An alcoholic risks losing his family and his job, systematically alienating all who would ever respect or care for him;     Robert Pollard is loved, adored, and urine-free. Surely this career     arc is the very embodiment boozing success, a seminal text on how to     drink professionally for more than a decade.</p>
<p>The secret directions to the Bizarro dimension Pollard inhabits,     however, have until now been well-concealed, only unearthed from the     occasional between-song words of wisdom doled out at GBV gigs, and     impossible to accurately assemble into a true life-plan. With the     tearful passing of GBV's live act, it seemed as though the teachings     would be lost forever, but listen up, drunky, because there's hope:     <i>Relaxation of the Asshole</i>, like the Rosetta Stone of Inebriation, is     the first step towards making sense of the the Man, the Wisdom, and     the ins and outs of a healthy career in alcoholism.</p>
<p>Yes, this most definitely is a CD of stage banter, Uncle Bob's rants,     and nothing but. Let the record show that you have been warned: The     only precedent I can think of (and painstakingly verified by minutes     of searching) is <i>Having Fun on Stage With Elvis</i>. Now,     if anyone deserves that treatment more than Elvis (and lots do, for     sure-- we should make a rule that 20 years of touring and at least     one band member with a substance abuse problem makes one of these     albums mandatory), it's Uncle Bob.</p>
<p>The similarities are manifest, as both have performed some of the most     classic rock songs of all time (of, uh, varying levels of renown).      The difference, of course, is that at the time of Elvis' recording, he     was a pill-addled super-heavyweight surrounded with yes-men eager to     milk a buck from a fan base dumb enough to pay for an album of ""thank     ya""'s and ""uh-huh""'s, while, conversely, every time Bob bitches about     Adam Duritz, I kind of secretly wish that he was my dad.</p>
<p>And by now you've surely seen the rating. On the scale of artist     indulgence, and by any other measure for that matter, this is a solid     10.0 if ever there was one, friends. This-- <i>this</i>-- is a 10 as surely     as <i>Metal Machine Music</i> is a 10, as surely as <i>Having Fucking Fun on     Stage With Elvis</i> is a 10, as surely as any exercise so bafflingly,     inexplicably, unintentionally <i>and</i> intentionally hilarious even in     concept is a 10; good god-- what the hell else can this album     receive? The rating is inconsequential. It's either a 10 or a zero,     and considering Bob is the reigning king of intoxicated concert     rambling it's sure as hell not a zero, m'man. A single listen will     verify this. Behold!</p>
<p>""Rolling Stone just published a list of the top 100 guitar players of     all time-- and they included Joan Jett. How can you fuckin' put Joan     Jett in the top 100 guitar players of all time? Ahead of Pete     Townshend! <i>Rolling Stone sucks</i>! They can blow me forever! If     anyone here is from <i>Rolling Stone</i> they can blow me. You want some     payola? Here's some payola, motherfuckers!""</p>
<p>Gold.</p>
<p>""To everyone that says we have a drinking problem, we say 'Fuck you.'      I said it to my mom.""</p>
<p>Golder.</p>
<p>""I wanna know how the guy from the Counting Crows used to fuck     everybody from 'Friends'? How the fuck'd he do it? He's an ugly     motherfucker! He's fatter than me! What the fuck's he got? Money.""</p>
<p>See?! This isn't some album you listen to because you enjoy listening     to it, let alone more than once-- oh no. This isn't the summer jam     for a cruise round the OC or the soundtrack to your formative years as     a misunderstood adolescent. This is a long-view textbook interspersed     with cheering and unintelligible phrases; you study it, you     internalize it, and then you go forth and lead a better life.      Subsequent listens are irrelevant-- why keep meditating once you've     reached nirvana? When it comes to drinking for a living, you learned     from the best; never look back.</p></div>"|6383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6383-relaxation-of-the-asshole/|0.0|Eric Carr

The only problem with it was that it was a little boring, which albums like that often are. Plenty of people try and wow us with their knob-twist symphonies, and unless there's something particularly distinctive about them, they come out kind of specialized and geekoid: I'm as into oscillator settings as anyone, but keeping track of whose sine-waves modulate better feels as academic as clocking every garage-rock single to come along. Solvent's Kraftwerk pulse and peculiar pop sensibility kept the record likeable, but it couldn't make it all that striking.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, there's also <i>Elevators and Oscillators</i>, an album companion to the LP proper. Solvent's catalog works like most dance act's-- meditative on the albums, floor-conscious on the singles-- and the remakes and remixes collected here deliver on some of those more vivid 12"" pleasures. In and around five new songs, a variety of participants put spins on the guy's singles juice, including three takes each on ""For You"" and the career-making ""My Radio"". And, well: Secondary ""companion"" though this may be, sonic variety and looser beats let the results pop in a way the album couldn't.</p><p>
    
    Germans help, obviously. Alter Ego, for instance, come along to turn ""Think Like Us"" into a trendily harsh robot-rocker; turned up loud enough, it might be just the thing for 2raumwohnung fans and Daft Punk disappointees. Schneider TM takes things in exactly the opposite direction, remaking ""My Radio"" as a skittery indie pop song, complete with mutated acoustic guitar plucks, boyish vocals, and a revised indie-kid lyric. Low-country headbanger Legowelt covers the same track with his usual spooky growl, though he doesn't go nearly as lovably grim as usual; Mitgang Audio remix it with some added electro strut. Lowfish puts a dream-sheen on ""For You"", Isan go ahead and make it fully subliminal, and then JDSY come along to beat all with the most arresting thing here-- raw non-robot vocals over an gorgeous, chiming build.</p><p>
    
    Fold in those new Solvent tracks, and it's a treat for anyone who dug <i>Apples and Synthesizers</i>. Fold them out, and it'd still be a workable comp-- a nice, versatile handful of post-electro sounds for those who weren't quite up for 45 minutes of Solvent's private time. How excited do <i>you</i> get about hardware?</p></div>"|7783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7783-elevators-and-oscillators/|6.1|Nitsuh Abebe

Just as the ad hoc construction of the wing didn't stop it from taking wind, the aesthetic of Emperor X's recording belies its craft. Homemade and sometimes grungily recorded, the latest record by Chad Matheny's one-man band delivers jitter-- and indie pop that practically gnaws its own arm with excitement.</p><p>
<i>Central Hug/Friendarmy/Fractal Dunes</i> (a single album named as if it were a collection of EPs) has the same aesthetic as last year's <i>Tectonic Membrane/Thin Strip on an Edgeless Platform</i>, but the pace is quicker. Matheny's urgent screams are like Travis Morrison's speak-sing, but while he tempers the album with typical indie ballads (""The Citizens of Wichita"", ""Ainseley""), it's frenzied anthems like ""Edgeless"" that sell this junkheap.</p><p>
    
    Matheny built the record from tinny beats and synths, guitar scraped like by nails as if against files, imagery both lucid and absurd, and bass and percussion that wander in so casually you could forget that he recorded and meticulously overdubbed the parts by himself. He tempers his inventiveness with willful crudeness-- as on the closing instrumental, where he changes the tempo by just knocking down the tape speed. And while there are as many beats as guitars-- ""Sfearion"" is enthusiastic indietronica, with whomping bass near the end-- the synths are as refreshingly rough as the rest of the music: The poppiest songs are fuzzed out and distorted, but still fit for dancing, or at least for hurtling yourself in place.</p><p>
    
    It's easy to act nonchalant about lo-fi, four-track wizardry, and in the post-Microphones, post-Postal Service world, we underrate the use of beats, new textures or inventive overdubs because we insist that originality won't make a record engaging. But <i>Central Hug</i> doesn't settle for sounding ""original"" or ""clever"": It nakedly gives a shit about itself, as Matheny assembles his album with tape and cheap wire, building it quickly before the hurricane passes and stretching it to the breaking point with the shout that's scrawled across the disc's face, ""GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO...""</p></div>"|11736.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11736-central-hugfriendarmyfractaldunes-and-the-dreams-that-resulted/|7.7|Chris Dahlen

A year after critics and listeners alike griped over <em>Delirium Cordia</em>'s one-track, 74-minute masturbatory venture into horror-film scores and spook-metal, Mike Patton pulls a complete 180 with <em>Suspended Animation</em>. Hated 74-minute tracks? Patton splits his new record into 30 tracks (chronologically named after a day in April 2005), with most falling short of the two-minute mark. Turned off by the whole horror thing? Well, Patton's got a cute little twist-- horror and death metal are still prevalent on <em>Suspended Animation</em>, but to lighten things up, Fantômas borrow from the playful, nostalgic world of cartoons.</p><p>
    And yet the album still suffers from the same flaws that hampered <em>Delirium Cordia</em>. With the average track spanning less than 90 seconds, musical ideas either bleed from one song to the next or don't sustain themselves long enough to register in the listener's head. The 30 tracks thus fuse into one 44-minute conglomerate, making the album a truncated, accelerated version of <i>Delirium</i>. And as for the light-hearted ""Looney Tunes"" motif, let's just say Patton's idea of good ol' fashioned Saturday morning programming is less ""Duck Tales"" than it is ""Tales From the Crypt"". Just as nearly every horror film nowadays contains a climax where some six-year-old sitting on the floor sings ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" moments before the killer emerges, the children's voice samples and bizarre juxtapositions of music boxes and unearthly shrieking terrify much more effectively than they amuse.</p><p>
    Despite the novelty, Fantômas occasionally remind us of their esteemed metal pedigree, and, if only in small doses, give a glimpse of their true potential. ""04/02/05 Saturday"" opens with a brief but brilliant math metal riff from Melvins frontman Buzz Osborne, and Dave Lombardo's apocalyptic snare rolls on ""04/10/05 Sunday"" suggest the former Slayer drummer didn't attend church that day. Patton once again twists and distorts his vocals beyond recognition, so much so that on ""04/24/05 Sunday"" he sounds as mechanical as Osborne's shredding metal guitar. Still, too often the question arises of whether Fantômas wants to make musical progress or scare the shit out of you. Since <i>The Director's Cut</i> the band has increasingly lost touch with form and melody in their songwriting. While those elements are hardly essential in producing experimental noise metal, they're preferred over the unfocused, kitschy sampling and sound effects that have replaced them. With today's cartoons darker and more violent than ever, I'm sure cartoon music could someday sound as though influenced by <em>Suspended Animation</em>, but I highly doubt any rock music will.</p></div>"|2990.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2990-suspended-animation/|5.8|Adam Moerder

Hinson moved to Abilene, Texas, when he was just a child. As a teenager, he saw his share of trouble, falling in with a storybook femme fatale (a model and widow of a local rock musician, even) and serving a brief stint in county lock-up-- all before his twentieth birthday. This backstory, touted in his press materials, sounds almost too good to be true, but there's no reason to think it's any kind of fabrication. The point, besides, is not that Hinson has desert cred, but that his Tennessee-to-Texas trajectory parallels that of Willie Nelson and other outlaw country singers who fled Nashville for more sympathetic climes. Of course, Hinson isn't running from the mainstream, and he has no concentrated center against which to define himself, but he makes music-- specifically, his self-titled debut with the Gospel of Progress, a motley group that seemingly consists of any number of musicians playing twice as many instruments-- obviously on his own terms, which is less revolutionary today than it was thirty years ago, but still important.</p><p>
    His debut is, in some ways, similar to Nelson's <i>Red-Headed Stranger</i>: Both are concept albums about the painful dissolution of a relationship and the dire self-reckoning that inevitably follows. However, instead of going on a murderous spree across the range, Hinson's protagonist gets lost within himself: ""I've been waiting so long up in these trees,"" he sings on ""The Day Texas Sank to the Bottom of the Sea"", ""trying to hang myself with thoughts of you, thoughts of me."" It's a vague metaphor with vaguely country-music wordplay, but it defines these songs as exorcisms of memory, music as a form of healing, or progress.</p><p>
    Lyrically, Hinson is a stark minimalist. These 14 songs are uniformly plain-spoken and concise, and they tend to repeat a phrase or a verse, worrying it until it becomes frayed around the edges. ""Don't You"" pulls apart a five-word plea\xD1""Don't you forget about me""-- until it's positively threadbare, and on ""I Still Remember"", Hinson and Sarah Lewes sing the same verse back and forth, changing only the pronouns to juggle the blame. This approach proves deceptively simple, playing up the ambiguity of so few words. On the album opener, ""Close Your Eyes"", he comforts a lover with sweet words: ""Close you eyes and don't you make a sound/ There's no worries now, there's no one else around to hear you cry."" But are these words really so innocent? Couldn't he just as likely be sending her to her death as to sleep, similar to the ambiguous beginning of <i>Red-Headed Stranger</i>?</p><p>
    Musically, this debut is lovingly and exactingly orchestrated with an array of instruments-- not just the usual piano, cello, and drums, but also flute, organ, melodica, and horns-- that subtly shade the songs' emotions. Strangely, however, Hinson entertains few possibilities and seems to rely too heavily on his acoustic guitar to shape the tracks. The opener, ""Close Your Eyes"", sets the general tone for the album, which (despite the apocalyptic chorus of ""At Last, Our Promises"") doesn't really break until track 10, ""Patience"", during which Hinson's imperturbably hangdog vocals reach a feverish holler and his anger spews forth.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, a few of the preceding tracks-- namely, ""The Nothing"" and ""Stand in My Way""-- lose their distinctiveness and blur into each other, creating a mid-album lull that bends toward maudlin. After that respite, however, Hinson speeds the album to its gospel climax on ""The Day Texas Sank to the Bottom of the Sea"", which proves a near-perfect finale both musically and lyrically. The song's heavenward crescendo and the absolving catharsis both sound well-earned.</p></div>"|4009.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4009-micah-p-hinson-and-the-gospel-of-progress/|7.6|Stephen M.

I'm not yet sure what my cluttered mind makes of this yet-- as with anything, there's plenty of upside and corresponding downside. Regardless, we plunge forward into this new, fast world further every day, and there's lately been a surge in the number of albums that explode with song shrapnel, tossing ideas like brown rice and mixed vegetables and leaving further development to the imagination or later records.</p><p>
    
    Case in point is this Hank record, a sardine job that packs 15 songs into 28 minutes, slicing and dicing pop and punk songs and feeding them to a cheerleading competition. The Hank collective lurk somewhere in Toronto, a group of enthusiastically amateur female vocalists and instrumentalists swirling around a bearded Canadian guy called Cab who sings alternately with a kind of cockney sneer borrowed from late-70s English punk, an indie boy shout, and a country-ish baritone. What you'd call the overall result of this is up for some debate: ""Spazz-pop"" ignores the fact that there are bite-sized ballads in this mix, but it works for the uptempo songs, which constitute the majority, while other modern rock crit hyphenates all fall short on some account or another. Their are also dabs of early hip-hop, and the only thing I can really think of to compare it directly to is the Go! Team, though they're not as saturated or noisy as that band.</p><p>
    
    Hank's hodgepodge sonic jumble is full of wildly disparate elements-- a pounding kickdrum mixing it up with spluttering piano on one track; a jagged, disjointed guitars stabbed by buzzing bass on the next. Steadfastly unprofessional vocals act as the crazy glue that sticks everything together in a big, exuberant wad. As random and tangential as the album's flow is, though, it's obvious that it's a carefully designed trainwreck, sort of a Rube Goldberg deal where the train going off the tracks is just the first in a series of events that leads to an egg being cooked.</p><p>
    
    Take ""The Earless"", for example: Record scratching, violent glockenspiel, Cab's freaked-out cockney and the girls' loose harmonies look like a mess at first, but the way they come together undeniably makes for a bracing concoction. The song that follows, ""Heswall Diesel"", is comparatively straightforward and one of the album's best. A heavy, whomping beat, churning post-punk guitars and a crunching bassline lay down the attack while two-part female harmonies announce, ""I'm going out to do some heavy petting."" Unexpected pauses heighten the danceability of it, at least until it suddenly morphs into a depressive guitar dirge with a guy whispering ""dead friends"" over the top.</p><p>
    
    On the whole, this is a warped trip that deserves to bring some attention to Hank as the upstart provocateurs they seem to be. Of course, that's perhaps a bit complicated by the fact that the album was initially issued in a limited edition of 500, each of which had different artwork by Hank member Paige Gratland. Hopefully, they'll be trotting it out in a wider release soon so more people can get their hands on it, but for the meantime, it's a highly enjoyable if questionably sane statement of purpose.</p></div>"|4006.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4006-how-to-prosper-in-the-coming-bad-years/|8.1|Joe Tangari

And though their latest work, <i>Absencen</i>, overturns few new stones, this thoughtfully organized album finds the extended group operating at peak levels of cohesion and features some of their most adventurously textured compositions to date.</p><p>
    One of the great band names of our times, Kammerflimmer Kollektief translates to ""Shimmering Collective"", and began its existence back in the late 90s as the one-man ambient project of composer and multi-instrumentalist Thomas Weber. The music contained on <i>Absencen</i>, however, has clearly been formed and fitted by more than one pair of hands, with several of tracks here co-written by harmonium player Heike Aumüller and one attributed to an improvisation by bassist Johannes Frisch.</p><p>
    The album's inclusive temperament extends to its instrumentation as well, with each of the Kollektief's members allowed an equal voice in the mix to give these pieces their rich, fluid density. On several tracks the group's sound is augmented by the exotic pedal steel flourishes of Trapist's Martin Siewert, an addition that joins with Heike Wendelin's violins to further lengthen the shadows of the group's already canyon-wide sound.</p><p>
    This combination is particularly potent on ""Unstet (Für Jeffrey Lee Pierce)"", an appropriately high and lonesome tribute to the late Gun Club leader that also blends harmonica and acoustic guitar into a stately, elegiac drone incorporating elements of the traditional tune ""Shenandoah"". Other such standouts include the brief, lovely ""Hausen"", which marries jazzy reeds to wistful country strains, and the opening ""Lichterloh"", a restless narrative that glides across acres of placid ambient swells before being rent asunder by D. Wurm's skronking saxophone blurts and Weber's space age keyboard effects.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, on such tracks as ""Nachtwache, 15. September"" the Kollektief does occasionally stumble through relatively uninspired passages of polite fusion, resulting in music that settles too cozily into the ranks of the merely pretty. Thankfully, such moments on <i>Absencen</i> are rare, and are outnumbered by the impressive likes of ""Die Vögel Sangen Drauben Ihre Ungereimte,"" an epic closer featuring Weber and the rest of the group in full exploratory mode, as they forge ahead inquisitively, leaving an ever-shifting, endlessly fascinating array of discarded sounds in their wake.</p></div>"|4382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4382-absencen/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

    begins the last and most ambitious track, ""Fiction"", on the
    Lucksmiths' eighth album, <em>Warmer Corners</em>. So too is this
    long-running Australian trio's brand of guitar-pop: idiosyncratic but
    accessible, literate but unpretentious, gentle but not weak, sincere
    not so much in presentation (cf. Springsteen, Bruce; Confessional,
    Dashboard) as in presence (cf. Richman, Jonathan; Comedy, Divine).</p><p>
    
    ""Only connect,"" E.M. Forster-- who was twee if Belle &amp; Sebastian ever were-- once wrote. As the epigraph for his 1910 novel, <em>Howards End</em>,
    these words described urban-- ""creeping London""-- intersecting with
    rural, heart coming into harmony with mind. <em>Warmer Corners</em> is
    an album of and about such connections, where they meet, how they fall
    apart, and how they become art.</p><p>
    
    Known for supple wordplay, on this outing guitarist and primary
    songwriter Marty Donald opens up his diction and closes his rhyming
    dictionary. Don't worry, he's still flush with inspired lines like
    ""you kept your distance and me guessing, finally acquiescing"" on
    ""Great Lengths"", about a girl playing hard to get who gets hardily
    gotten. But ""The Music Next Door"" merely rhymes ""door"" with ""more""
    with ""a song I've heard a hundred times before,"" which all makes sense
    even if you miss the subtle wink. Then there's its Chekhovian
    storyline and its ambiguous non-resolution. You'll get it, <em>O.C.</em>
    kids will think they get it, and everybody's happy until concert
    tickets sell out. Look, over there, isn't that Ben Gibbard? [yoink]</p><p>
    
    Ahem. <i>Warmer Corners</i> also broadens the emotional base of its
    predecessor, 2003's excellent and underrated <em>Naturaliste</em>. That
    album allowed the regret that had simmered stoically since at least as
    early as 1999's <em>Staring at the Sky</em> to reach full boil. ""How did
    they come to this?"" vocalist/drummer Tali White wondered dolefully.
    The same sorrow clouds <em>Warmer Corners</em>, but beneath exultant
    arrangements propelled by guest Lucksmith Louis Richter's <em>Rubber
    Soul</em> guitar leads along with horns, strings, organ, and pedal
    steel. The happy-music-with-sad-lyrics shtick has been done often, but
    rarely so well since the Lucksmiths' namesakes. White's ""Sunlight in a
    Jar"" provides a shy respite of sheer joy.</p><p>
    
    Though most previous Lucksmiths songs loll charmingly within the
    Aussie countryside, 1997 throwaway ""Wyoming"" excepted, <em>Warmer
    Corners</em> acknowledges the band's extensive U.S. touring. Lead
    single ""The Chapter in Your Life Entitled San Francisco"" neatly
    juxtaposes both locales, with winter rolling out in Fog City as summer
    slowly passes Down Under. The song's soaring choruses and downcast
    gaze thrill me even more than when I first reviewed them. On the
    winningly meta ""Fiction"", White sings longingly of ""a girl from Kansas
    City"" in his usual rich, Morrissey-esque phrasing. Other songs take
    place unmistakably in Australia or bassist Mark Monnone's new home of
    Tasmania. The Lucksmiths never relinquish their distinctive identity,
    merely expand it.</p></div>"|4909.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4909-warmer-corners-2005/|8.3|Marc Hogan

    Centro-matic, the diaphanous balladry of South San Gabriel, or the
    somber alt.country the darling of Denton, Texas, records under his own
    name-- and you want to maximize your chances of enjoying <em>The
    Carlton Chronicles</em>, you'd do well to avoid all reviews of it
    except this one, which will elide an ostensibly central aspect of the
    record: Its concept.</p><p>
    
    Yep, it's a concept record-- sort of. Johnson's imagery is circumspect
    and oblique, his lyrics often indecipherably garbled, as if he were
    backing off from the concept even as he committed it to tape. It'll
    only be apparent to listeners who've read reviews that harp on it, and
    once you know, it's tough to give the record a fair shake: The somber
    seriousness of the music is hard to reconcile with the absurdity of
    [CONCEPT EXPURGATED].</p><p>
    
    But these good intentions are already gut-shot and staggering; now
    you're direly curious: What could it be about? The square dude from
    <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</em>? Nah, way off. And my fingers are
    hovering over the three keys that would irrevocably reveal it all, as
    reality limps in on silent paws (hint hint): Beyond the imperceptible
    concept and some perfumed adjectives regarding beauty and ethereality,
    there isn't much to say about <em>The Carlton Chronicles</em>.</p><p>
    
    It <em>is</em> beautiful, that's certain: Check out ""Charred Resentment
    the Same"", with its two movements of lazing guitars and double-tracked
    vocals (one high and clear, the other low and husky, recalling Iron
    and Wine's technique on ""Upward Over the Mountains"") bridged by a
    dual-guitar conversation and a distantly shimmering organ. Or
    ""Predatory King Today"", with its melancholic M. Ward-ish warble,
    gently accumulating arpeggios, and perfectly positioned slide guitar
    accents. Shuffle these descriptions through various permutations to
    attain a sense of the album on the main, or imagine Sufjan Stevens
    ghostwriting for Neil Young.</p><p>
    
    But here's the crux: Do you like golf-course beauty, the unbroken
    idyll with everything in its right place? Or flowers-in-the-wreckage
    beauty, flawed and exotic, becoming beautiful in its deviation from
    the ideal? Fans of the former will enjoy the procession of homecoming
    queens, winsome but somehow artificial, that comprises <em>The Carlton
    Chronicles</em>, but fans of the latter might feel they've depleted its
    charms after a couple spins and begin pining for the cute punk girl
    with the overlarge eyes and obnoxious laugh. Either way, you're better
    off not knowing that it's supposed to be about a sick cat. Oops!</p></div>"|7809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7809-the-carlton-chronicles-not-until-the-operations-through/|6.0|Brian Howe

They just happen to like wearing leather jackets and having their gaunt faces photographed in elevators. Their idea to combine new wave, garage rock, and dance music just popped into their head, because, hey, what if rock bands started doing that? The Bravery aren't fooling anybody: They fit the post-new wave blueprint so immaculately, they're one power chord away from securing a gig at the 2005 VMA's between their rivals the Killers and Razorlight. So here come the Bravery-- hi-hats, synthesizers, mop-tops, ennui, and all.</p><p>
    
    The Bravery try to resuscitate worn-out 80s pop progressions with squeaky-clean production, wrapping their chord changes with layers of synthesizer and power-pop guitar until something sounds interesting. The results are forgivable but disappointing nonetheless. ""Swollen Summer"" sorely lacks a jaw-dropping melody to complement its Go-Go's power chords. Other tracks can't quite get their basslines off the ground, partially due to frontman Sam Endicott's inability to go anywhere with the song's one melodic hook.</p><p>
    
    Endicott is perhaps the most egregious new wave conglomerate around. Shifting through imitations of Robert Smith, Simon Le Bon, and Julian Casablancas, Endicott exercises little subtlety when borrowing from his influences. He reaches into the somber bowels of <i>Disintegration</i> for the haunting vocals on ""No Brakes"", yet apes Casablancas's sanguine croon on ""The Ring Song"". Resembling other singers isn't a dealbreaker, but when this likeness occurs multiple times across the course of an album-- and with such disparate singing styles-- it raises a red flag. Throw in a propensity for self-deprecation, and Endicott is a walking Cliff's Notes for new wave revivalists; on ""Out of Line"" he's ""a liar, but not a cheat,"" on ""Unconditional"", a ""beggar, and...a chooser,"" and on ""Tyrant"" he's ""stuck just like a pig"". The titles alone beat his whole ""helpless subjection"" bit to death.</p><p>
    
    Occasionally, these squirrels do stumble across a nut. The chorus of ""An Honest Mistake"" contains one of the few sassy moments on the album, with Endicott mockingly singing in falsetto ""Don't look at me that way/ It was an honest mistake."" Also, when you pour three synthesizers into each song, you're bound to find a cool hook, like the one in the verse of ""Tyrant"". Despite these highlights, though, this is still rock made on an assembly line-- predictable, economically efficient, and about as dynamic as a Model T.</p></div>"|1154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1154-the-bravery/|5.3|Adam Moerder

Their matching jumpsuits and space-age specs are brilliantly meta, not to mention the egregious shoutouts to new wave influences. <em>Polysics or Die!!!</em>, a greatest hits compilation of sorts-- and Polysics's first release since leaving Asian Man Records-- sports titles like ""New Wave Jacket"", ""Eno"", the not-so-veiled ""XCT"", and a cover of ""My Sharona"". However, the Polysics' obsession with a certain Akron, Ohio five-piece permeates this collection. Not only do they boast the craziest synth, surf guitar, robo-beat and spastic vocals combo since <i>Freedom of Choice</i>, but everything's accelerated for current listeners' frenetic, DDR-paced attention spans.</p><p>
    
    California-based Tofu, a label specializing in exposing unsung Japanese acts to the States, picks up on this connection and by re-recording five of Polysics' best songs for the album, they make a concerted attempt to pique the Nintendo demographic. Usually these re-recordings simply improve the lo-fi Asian Man takes, but the difference is considerable. The matador-inspired chromatic chords of ""Buggie Techinica"" get the arena treatment, sounding even larger and more grandiose than the <i>Hey! Bob! My Friend!</i> version. ""Hot Stuff"" also benefits by harder rocking production, its chunky bassline and yelping vocals no longer sounding as though recorded from a boom box.</p><p>
    
    At the time of their release, each Polysics album has appeared to be ""the big one,"" the record that endears Americans to these goofy homages to new wave nerd rock. Unfortunately, <i>Hey! Bob! My Friend!</i> and <i>Neu</i>, both adored by critics, have barely registered in even the most open-minded indie rock circles, and there's little reason to think this compilation will buck that trend. Perhaps the video game beeps and glitches seem too tacky, or the sugary Japanese vocals too kiddy, or the audacious album title too cocksure compared to today's modest, pretend-like-you-don't-give-a-fuck bands, but this band actually deserves those three exclamation points.</p></div>"|6398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6398-polysics-or-die/|8.2|Adam Moerder

    inspiration. The ridiculous liner notes and other contextualizations have followed Weird War 
    singer Ian Svenonious since his days in Nation Of Ulysses and the Make-Up, qnd <em>Illuminated by the Light</em> ironically winks so 
    hard it tears up, but this album-- the band's most cohesive to date-- is full of grooves that sincerely want you to dance.</p><p>
    This is Weird War at their most minimal and stoned-- hyper-compressed single-note guitar lines that 
    boogie over thick bass and sparse funky drumming, with Svenonious or 
    singer Michelle Mae calling out lewd comments from the fog. Weird War have 
    been deconstructing clichés since their conception by delivering them 
    with maximum smirk, and <em>Illuminated</em> uses them all so you never have 
    to hear them again. ""Girls Like That"" is a disco-shuffling highlight 
    but after four minutes, I never have to hear that ""Staying Alive"" 
    bassline ever again. The story of ""Motorcycle Mongoloid"" unfolds with 
    purposeful, hilarious tedium, and I've since sworn off ""Leader of the 
    Pack""-style narrative songs entirely.</p><p>
    But many of these tracks are clever 
    concepts that are dull in execution and often overstay their welcome, like the vocal ad-libbing at the end of ""Crystal Healing"" 
    or the fake-out ending of ""Illuminated"", an otherwise great track with 
    swinging guitar and a well-placed dash of cheap electronic drums. Only 
    ""Earth Mama Woman Girl Child"" lets its hair down, a drum-cricle 
    acoustic strum with Svenonious returning to his Make-Up mode of falsetto 
    hysterics.</p><p>
    Weird War's eponymous debut was a sloppy, brilliant mess and a hell 
    of a lot of fun, something that has been fractioning with every subsequent
    release. If brevity if the soul of wit, then part of what made 
    <em>Weird War</em> work was the short songs, and last year's 
    <em>If You Can't Beat Em, Bite 'Em</em> had more variety-- not to mention 
    ass-shakers like ""AK-47"". <em>Illuminated by the Light</em> is Weird War 
    in command of their craft, but sounding surprisingly sedate.</p></div>"|8619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8619-illuminated-by-the-light/|7.3|Jason Crock
