Alcest's third LP,<i> Les Voyages de l'Âme</i>, feels like his ultimate statement on this particular approach. Paut, who first made his mark playing purer black metal, has been at Alcest longer than he contributed to the eccentric, raw, politically tricky black-metal crew Peste Noire. During Alcest's run, his dynamic genre-meshing post-punk black-metal quartet Amesoeurs came and went. While he'll likely continue working with German musician Herbst on the blackened post-rock band Lantlôs, he's not the one piloting that ship (ditto Forgotten Woods). That, and Old Silver Key, his collaboration with members of Drudkh, felt like a half-baked one-off. All to say, despite the insane list of associations and circles affixed to his name, the multi-tasking French multi-instrumentalist has been increasingly focused on this one higher profile, very personal project.</p>
<p>The attention he's given Alcest has given him time to hone (and ramp up) the signature sound. Instead of shifting things, or looking for ways to expand the aesthetic, he's been trying to perfect something very specific. When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/6659-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank"">I spoke to Neige</a> about Alcest in 2007, he said the concept for the band was connected to ""visions"" he had as a child of ""an indescribably beautiful place  where everything-- trees, glades, and brooks-- produces a pearly light  and where a faraway and celestial music floats in the air like a  perfume."" The songs recorded under the Alcest name are ""the musical  testimony of these experiences."" It's a fairy or dream land that he's trying to recreate sonically, and each record apparently clarifies and better maps something that's been in his head for a long time. So, while the dogged reliance on a particular formula is essential to the project, it's problematic if you're looking for variation.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be a surprise that<i> Les Voyages</i>, translated ""The Journeys of the Soul,"" is the most accomplished Alcest offering. That's the way things have been going for a while. (Per usual, Paut handles everything but the drums, again tackled again by ex-Amesoeurs/Peste Noire player Winterhalter of Les Discrets, and ex-Alcest/Amesoeurs guitarist Fursy Teyssier, also of Les Discrets, did the artwork.) Part of Alcest's charm, though, has been the project's imperfections: The haze of the 2005 two-song, Charles Baudelaire-cribbing debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15467-le-secret-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Le Secret</a></i>-- its abrupt shifts between nature recordings, clean dream-pop acoustics, and raw black metal-- was transfixing and, despite all the beauty, strange.</p>
<p>Seven years later he's clarified and crystallized that approach, sure, and lost something in that translation. (It's hard to go back into the shadows once you've left them.) In one sense, it <i>is</i> a return to form. 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14164-ecailles-de-lune/"" target=""_blank"">Écailles de Lune</a></i> took on a darker cast. It was a fine record, but Alcest sound best when he's chasing after sunspots. You do get plenty of that here, along with the usual smeary French singing and pretty shoegaze sentimentality. The standout moment, I think, is the transition from the more frantic ""Beings of Light""-- a soaring, angelic blur that opens with a kind of airy choir-- to the almost eight-minute ""Faiseurs de Mondes"", a track that makes use of the group's heavier tendencies (plenty of black-metal howls) alongside a catchier pop riff and a very dense melodicism. In ""Beings of Light"", it's unclear if he's saying anything or just holding notes, and it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>When Alcest made their New York City premiere a couple of years ago-- a show I helped organize-- Paut had lost his voice, so he handed over his vocal duties to someone else in the band, touring guitarist Zero. Paut, in turn, stood in the background. It felt natural to me; he's not really a frontman. Here, when everything's as clear as it is on <i>Les Voyages de l'Âme</i>, he feels almost too exposed, and the big climaxes he's reaching for don't arrive. There's no denying the beauty, but it feels weirdly muted-- or perhaps just unsurprising. Paut doesn't write pop songs memorable enough to exist entirely as pop, and at this point enough people are blending black metal with a variety of softer genres that those explosions don't send shivers like they did in the past. Surprise is essential to his plan. Now, instead of straddling and bridging two genres in unique ways, it feels as if he's treading water in both.</p></div>"|16289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16289-les-voyages-de-lame/|6.9|Brandon Stosuy

Perhaps their name was too misleading or their lineup too precarious, but the Bastards escaped the mantle that's been assigned to everyone from the Strokes to the Black Keys and most recently to the Alabama Shakes. If that has left them out of enviable company, at least they've managed to attract a loyal audience and even star in a crucial ""Friday Night Lights"".</p>
<p>Their first for Partisan Records, <i>Arrow</i> is their crunchiest album since Erika Wennerstrom gutted the original trio in 2008 and rebuilt the Bastards as a quartet. Largely discarding the fiddle, pedal steel, and banjo that fleshed out 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12697-the-mountain/"" target=""_blank"">The Mountain</a></i>, the band and producer Jim Eno of Spoon strip things down to emphasize guitars and the rhythm section as much as vocals. They open these songs up, both enabling a heavier sound and making room for some weighty jamming. The result is less fussy than <i>The Mountain, </i>with room enough for some Skynyrd Southern rock on ""Late in the Night"" and Santana percussion on ""Skin and Bone"". They've developed a larger musical vocabulary, but the results can be cumbersome: With timpani and crackling guitar right out of a Morricone soundtrack, the nearly seven-minute centerpiece ""The Arrow Killed the Beast"" is more melodramatic than dramatic, weighted down by import and exaggerated ambience.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Bastards have begun courting the rock-revivalist constituency on <i>Arrow</i>. ""Whenever you need a pick-me-up, you gotta have gotta have rock'n'roll,"" Wennerstrom sings on ""Got to Have Rock and Roll"". Despite the dry classic-rock riff and chugging momentum, the song makes for a tepid endorsement. ""Skin and Bone"" is much less corny, as Wennerstrom sings, ""Oh, I want it to be like when I was young."" She may not be speaking specifically about rock'n'roll, but that line succinctly sums up listeners' evolving relationship with music and a desperate desire to connect as strongly as we did in our youth. Most of the Bastards songs address travel rather than age, which is how most touring bands interpret the write-what-you-know adage. ""Staring out at the city skyline, a marathon is going down the street,"" Wennerstrom sings on opener ""Marathon"". The song is about how life is a ""long race home,"" and dangling participle aside, it's an immensely awkward image to open the album.</p>
<p>Wennerstrom has always been a fairly workmanlike songwriter, although her voice and her band compensate when words fail her. The lyrics on <i>Arrow</i> are best when they settle for serviceable instead of strive for profound, and the line that resonates with the most meaning is also the one of the simplest: ""Oh I got you on my mind,"" she sings throughout ""Late in the Night"", and the romantic implications become clearer and bolder with each repetition. It helps that the Bastards play loud and hard enough to nearly drown out her vocals, reveling in the musical as well as the sexual tension. That's arguably more rock'n'roll than another song about rock'n'roll.</p></div>"|16285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16285-arrow/|6.4|Stephen M. Deusner

On last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15072-angels-of-darkness-demons-of-light-1/"" target=""_blank"">Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light 1</a></i>, she added an immediate, omnipresent grace. She swung softly during opener ""Old Black"", commanding the music's slow shifts with a righteous thump. And she carefully triggered album apex ""Descent to the Zenith"" with a light-footed march that served as the swivel for the rest of the band's melodic swoops. For all the deserved talk of Carlson's refinement and control as a guitarist, Davies was arguably his superior, guiding the quartet along with an unspoken, perfect resolve. Without her steady presence, one assumed, all of those light tones and slight menace might wash into blur, like watercolors escaping a drain.</p>
<p>It's surprising if not discomfiting, then, that the second volume of <i>Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light</i> opens mostly without Davies. For the first 12 minutes, she resigns to almost auxiliary roles. On opener ""Sigil of Brass"", Carlson explores elliptical snippets of a short guitar progression, a leader advancing with caution. Cellist Lori Goldston and bassist Karl Blau pick up his patterns, stretching the same sounds above and beneath his picking with long exhalations. But Davies plays only her cymbal, and barely, adding occasional clatters that seem mostly like reminders that she's still behind the kit. She's even less present on ""His Teeth Did Brightly Shine"", the sort of slow, shimmering strut that she's motored with Earth for the better part of a decade. Instead, Blau mostly thumbs the beat with his bass as Carlson teases out guitar-effects flotsam beneath the sidewinding lead line. Davies merely offers bits of shakers and shells, her percussion becoming an occasional footnote to its normal narrative thread.</p>
<p>Somehow, though, these tracks and their themes don't wash away or turn into seismic smears that would have suited Earth back when ""Kurt Kobain"" was offering up guest vocals. Recorded during the same sessions that yielded volume one of this series, they show the strong skeleton, sans distraction. More importantly, they confirm the suspicion that the crew Carlson gathered for the <i>Angels of Darkness</i> recordings is the most sympathetic, versatile, and unselfish group he's ever had. Without Davies, these first 12 minutes are some of the most muted in Earth's catalog, showcasing a band comfortable not only with its quiet but also with how a listener can hear clearly from one side of the mix to the other (compared especially to the impenetrable stuff of two decades ago). This is the epitome of cool, quiet confidence.</p>
<p>But it isn't lopsided growth, as <i>Angels II</i> isn't simply the softer side of its predecessor. ""The Corascene Dog"" is gentle but glinting, with Carlson and Goldston trading sinister dialogue between their strings. And despite its classically suggestive title, ""Waltz (A Multiplicity of Doors)"" is actually one of the most abrasive looks yet at Earth 2.0. Goldston wrenches astringent wails from her cello, while Davies trades her generally quiet thunder for a heavier foot and a relentless tide of cymbals. Blau lets every note linger with a little extra emphasis, and Carlson tucks a web of foreboding guitar effects beneath the serrated guitar line. Earth saves the most revelatory moment for last. ""The Rakehell"" generously infuses funk, with Davies' syncopated trot serving as the structure beneath a lysergic smear. Carlson plays bass, using the low notes mostly to state the melody so that his guitar can push beyond it. He refracts, multiplies, and manipulates the tone, using the guitar to find the midpoint between a Meters organ and a wailing, heavy-metal lead. In an unlikely move in a career full of them, Earth add much younger bands like Sun Araw and Eternal Tapestry to their list of contemporaries.</p>
<p>Indeed, for all the talk about <i>this </i>still-nascent phase of Earth versus <i>that </i>earlier frame-shifting phase, the twin <i>Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light</i> releases actually reveal a band with interests broader than such a binary might suggest. Earth aren't simply softening and separating their drone metal as if by centrifuge, or trying to be stately rather than beastly. These tracks are built on the brethren of blues, rock, and metal, but they wouldn't be compelling without pieces of bop buoyancy, minimalist restraint, classical consonance, and near-liturgical resolve. Oh, and believe it or not, funk. This version of Earth has simply given Carlson more room and more assistance to explore, well, darkness and light-- in his own time, of course.</p></div>"|16283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16283-angels-of-darkness-demons-of-light-ii/|7.9|Grayson Currin

The price has something to do with the album's place in history: <i>Biokinetics</i>, a touchstone of experimental techno, was the first album released on Berlin's widely worshipped <a href=""http://www.basicchannel.com/label/Chain+Reaction"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chain Reaction</a> label. But scarcity is a bigger factor: <i>Biokinetics</i>, like all of Chain Reaction's CDs from that era, came packaged in an aluminum tin that tended to crack the CD it was supposed to be protecting. (As a comment on Discogs notes, ""Another Chain Reaction release, another metal box that eats up CDs."")</p>
<p>Fortunately, 16 years later, John Twells' Massachusetts-based <a href=""http://typerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Type</a> label has stepped up with a reissue of the landmark album, not just on CD (this time in a standard jewel case) but also, for the first time, on 2xLP and digital download. It's a welcome reissue, and long overdue. It comes as certain ideas from techno's fertile, experimental, mid-1990s period are being picked up by a range of underground musicians. Many of these ideas have permeated so deeply into the culture that it's hard to remember a time without them, but we wouldn't have <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>, to name just one of the duo's distant descendants, without Porter Ricks' seafloor crackle and mottled-granite color scale.</p>
<p>Porter Ricks were the duo of Thomas Köner, a sound artist and ambient composer, and Andy Mellwig, a techno producer who also recorded as Continuous Mode and, with former Monolake member and future Ableton founder Gerhard Behles, as Async Sense. Released in 1996, <i>Biokinetics</i> was Porter Ricks' debut album, gathering tracks from three vinyl EPs released that year along with three songs exclusive to the album. It had been years since I last listened to it, and the Type reissue surprised me first by reminding me how diverse the album is. ""Chain Reaction"" has long since become shorthand for a certain fusion of buoyant dub, hazy ambience, and coiled techno, but on <i>Biokinetics</i>, none of these has quite settled into place; it's a dynamic, unpredictable mixture of pulse and hiss.</p>
<p>The opening ""Port Gentil"", a precursor to the template <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5821-wolfgang-voigt/"" target=""_blank"">Wolfgang Voigt</a> would adopt under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1686-gas/"" target=""_blank"">Gas</a> alias, pairs soft, monochromatic tones with a muted 4/4 pulse. On the surface, it couldn't be simpler, but as it pulls you in, you become aware of shifting contours and unusual dimensions, the interplay of light and shadow; it sounds like a string section tuning up atop a freight train trundling through a deep canyon.</p>
<p>""Nautical Dub"" hews closer to textbook techno, with muscular bass pushing relentlessly forward, but it's hardly conventional. There are no sharp edges, for one thing: Percussive accents have been buffed to a dull gleam, and the upper register of the track, normally reserved for crisp, cutting hi-hats, is diffused into a fine-gauge spray that sweeps back and forth like a lawn sprinkler. Only ""Port of Call"" assumes dancefloor techno's chiseled boom-tick profile, but this time it's the low end that's fizzed to near nothingness. A few years later, Pole would famously construct an entire aesthetic around the vagaries of a broken Waldorf filter, but <i>Biokinetics</i> was first: Everything sounds broken here, all frayed cables and dusty contacts, and every gesture toward techno clarity feels like a trade-off made at the expense of another element that's left to crumble.</p>
<p>Dub techno has since become one of electronic music's most mannered styles, but here, Porter Ricks' tracks feel not so much like compositions, much less stylistic exercises, than answers to very specific, fairly arcane questions-- what happens when we route this LFO through that filter? How many divisions can we parse between the downbeats? How can chaos be turned into rhythm, and how far can a repetition be stretched before it's rendered senseless? Where is the boundary between tone and white noise?</p>
<p>On ""Biokinetics 1"", a heaving, wheezing synthesizer struggles to stick to a regular pulse as it's fed through disorienting delay and looped back upon itself, stumbling and confused. As an experiment in stretching a groove to the breaking point, it's as exhilarating as anything in the history of techno. ""Port of Nuba"" and ""Nautical Nuba"" submit drum machines to a similar warping process, resulting in rhythms that gallop like teams of horses. Here, you can hear the origin of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/559-thomas-brinkmann/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Brinkmann</a>'s tumbling cadences of a year or two later, as he used a double-armed turntable to draw elliptical rhythms out of the grooves of records by Wolfgang Voigt and Richie Hawtin. And while we're talking about precedents, the leaden dirge of ""Biokinetics 2"" lays the groundwork for the bleak, trudging techno of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/"" target=""_blank"">Andy Stott</a> and his <a href=""http://www.modern-love.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Modern Love</a> labelmates.</p>
<p>That <i>Biokinetics</i> is an album about currents is reflected in its seafaring titles, such as ""Nautical Dub"", ""Nautical Zone"", ""Port of Call"", etc., and also in the way that the record's energies feed back into itself. What Porter Ricks learned from dub was less about particular rhythms or stylistic tropes than about the path that a sound travels as it wends its way through the mixing desk, and how it comes out transformed on the other side. Dub's hall-of-mirrors approach to versioning, meanwhile, informs the way that many tracks here are variations upon one another: ""Port Gentil"" and ""Nautical Zone"" bookend the album with nearly identical chords, while ""Nautical Nuba"" and ""Port of Nuba"" recycle the same drum patterns, using filters and delays to achieve very different results. Spontaneity is woven into the fiber of every track; it's easy to hear how some of them may have begun with the same sounds and patterns before the musicians' hands worked their magic on the filters, EQ, and delay, rendering each take unique and unrepeatable.</p>
<p>Like Detroit's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1149-drexciya/"" target=""_blank"">Drexciya</a>, Porter Ricks (who took their name from a character from <i>Flipper</i>, the 1960s film and television series) used aquatic metaphors to get at larger ideas, both musical and otherwise. Ocean currents, electrical currents, sound waves, feedback; dub, techno, minimalism, noise; exchange as a fluid back-and-forth but also, as Drexciya pointed out, as a loaded dynamic, fraught, unequal-- they all swirl together, rippling in time and veering out of sync, as though pulled by complicated gravitational forces. <i>Biokinetics</i> is above all a music of tides, suggesting rhythm as both celestial stroke and as a vibration deep in the body, bubbling at the molecular level.</p></div>"|16288.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16288-biokinetics/|8.5|Philip Sherburne

Over the past three years, he's arguably invented his own microgenre with ""based music,"" but a good number of the hundreds of songs he's released in that time are open love letters to other rap artists or regional sounds, from OJ Da Juiceman to Cormega. Any borderline insomniac can sometimes find <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/lilbthebasedgod"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">B on Twitter</a> when night bleeds into morning, tweeting furiously and enthusiastically about rappers such as the 504 Boyz, who have long been out of the spotlight, if they ever were in the first place.</p>
<p><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13085-white-flame-mixtape/"" target=""_blank"">White Flame</a> </i>is B's latest entry into his <i>Flame </i>series, an ongoing string of mixtapes that can be all over the place musically but often delve into the sounds and slang of classic New Orleans rap, right down to the covers, which are spot-on tributes to 1990s <a href=""http://www.penandpixel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pen &amp; Pixel collages</a>. They've also featured B close to his most unchained, which has led to songs that are fascinating, bizarre, and fantastic as well as ideas that are so unbelievably bad that they can come from only one person.</p>
<p>On all fronts, <i>White Flame </i>doesn't disappoint. There are tracks-- some hyper-lucid and some decidedly absurdist-- that will likely be some of the best songs that Lil B puts out this year. There is also a ridiculous near-diss track aimed at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1840-the-game/"" target=""_blank"">the Game</a>, a song that liberally samples ""I Would Die 4 U"" and another called ""BasedGod Fucked My Bitches"" that throws a preposterously mismatched drum loop under a generous sample of Daft Punk's ""One More Time"" for six and a half minutes. Predictably it's a pick-and-pull record, but those willing to sift can find plenty of reminders of why B is, if not vital, then at least still enduring.</p>
<p>Like most tapes in the <i>Flame </i>series, <i>White Flame </i>peaks when B is at his most wild. Here he often reverts back to the wild-eyed gangster, pseudo-gender-bending persona he developed on last year's <i>Bitch Mob </i>tape, resulting in hilarious and extremely singular tracks such as ""Bitch of the City"", ""I'm Fabio"", and ""Poppin V"" that blur the line between rapping and rambling and in many ways challenge what the art form is designed to do. The songs are purposefully funny and, like plenty of rap music, trade as much on charisma and the ability to coin catchphrases as anything, but they also beg the question of why exactly we need Lil B doing his most sincere <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/bgizzle"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">B.G.</a> impersonation while bragging for an entire track about taking ""grandpa pills"" in the first place.</p>
<p>Well, maybe we don't, but it's hard to listen to tracks like those-- balanced with more traditional songs like ""Surrender to Me"" and ""Neva Switch""-- and not feel an affinity for what Lil B is pulling off. His subversion of the conventions of the genre remains strong even as he becomes further assimilated into the mainstream, but more importantly he's coming from a place of love and reverence with regard to the music that he's twisting. There is no artifice or endgame, just a weird dude having fun with the music he-- and plenty of others-- grew up listening to. The best of <i>White Flame </i>won't convince those already turned off by Lil B, and some of it is outright useless, but the tape illustrates that he's still operating at a high level. The next few Lil B tapes are already just a keystroke away, but <i>White Flame </i>has songs to come back to, both for pure entertainment and if you ever find yourself wondering just how exactly the guy who raps, ""I can't believe it's not butter/ I'm Fabio,"" can keep pumping out so much unique, good music.</p></div>"|16290.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16290-white-flame/|6.3|Jordan Sargent

Though rebuilding efforts have been extensive, the effects of the disaster continue a year later, and in many cases the people of Japan still have no way of knowing if their food has been contaminated by radiation. This compilation, bringing together unreleased tracks from friends and likeminded musicians such as Deerhunter, Four Tet, and Terry Riley, is Makino's attempt to raise money and support for ongoing relief work in Japan.</p>
<p>Charity records are a tricky thing, since it can be difficult to make a group of artists' songs hang together like a traditional album. Some of the most notable examples (1993's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Alternative"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>No Alternative</i></a>, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12717-dark-was-the-night/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dark Was the Night</i></a>) got around this by using kind of a mixtape format, offering stylistically varied songs from loosely related bands buffet-style. <i>We Are the Works in Progress</i>, though, takes more of an AOR approach. Each of the cuts here are similar in pace (slow) and coloring (gray), and there's a somber, almost funereal quality that ties them all together. For example, Blonde Redhead's reworked ""Penny Sparkle"" is such a natural transition from John Roberts' ""Berceuse"" that you could mistake them for the same musician.</p>
<p>That cohesiveness goes a long way, but sometimes gets misspent on material that's a little on the weak side. There are some big names here, artists we expect to deliver on a consistent basis, but unfortunately they don’t give away their prime stuff. A good example is the Deerhunter contribution ""Curve"", a slow-building ambient rock piece that is perfectly pleasant-sounding but lacks the danger and emotional rawness that marks the band's best work. This is to be expected on a compilation like this, really, and Makino says as much in the liner notes but flips it as a positive. ""Many of these tracks are works in progress, hence the name... Unfinished things often carry more energy.""</p>
<p>That's true in certain spots. The best tracks here have a sketchy, rough-hewn quality that suggests an artist stumbling onto something promising. Pantha du Prince's ""Bird on a Wire"" sounds like a precursor to his breakout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13947-black-noise/"" target=""_blank""><i>Black Noise</i></a> material, teasing the combination of grit and airiness that made that album so compelling. Most of <i>Works</i> is not as strong, existing primarily in B-side territory, but there is something thematically satisfying about its looseness. Here's a record dedicated to a place that was wrecked and is trying to rebuild. The devastated parts of Japan won't resurrect in a day; it's a slow process of gray areas and false starts and moments of promise. That's how this music feels.</p></div>"|16286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16286-we-are-the-works-in-progress/|6.3|Joe Colly

The treble-heavy production is parallel to that of first-wave twee-punk. The guitars go way past indie pop's minimum quota for jangle. It's quite feasible that if you played Sea Lions for someone who wasn't aware the album was released near the end of 2011, they'd assume that they were a super-obscure band from the early or mid 1980s.</p>
<p>There's a stigma that comes along with having a style that represents a very specific time period, a school of thought that says anything thoroughly nailing a past era is regressive and harmful to the forward movement of music. But those influences had to come from somewhere, so why not cut out the middleman and go straight to the source? Especially if you can find a way to infuse it with your own personality. In that sense, <i>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sea Lions But Were Afraid to Ask</i> makes for a boilerplate, but immensely satisfying, noise-pop record. Dissonant and angular instrumentals are scattered throughout, giving the  album a light experimental edge. Major-key romps are punctuated with  glockenspiel, woozy tremolo bar work, and noisy guitar chicken-scratch.  The ballads shuffle like 1960s R&amp;B classics.</p>
<p>Frontman Adrian Pillado is a songwriter who closely adheres to the sensibilities of DIY twee. He has a playful and unsophisticated baritone that suggests either a less dour Ian Curtis or a more English Calvin Johnson. His lyrics focus on the awkwardness of young relationships, the allure of childhood, and burrowing his head underneath as many blankets and pillows as he can find. Sometimes he gets so caught up in his own neuroses that his voice trails off-key, but it's never in a way that feels like self-pity or melodrama. Pillado is charming and full enough of character to make his songs consistently entertaining, a trait he shares with the frontmen of all his influences, from the obvious ones (like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/531-beat-happening/"" target=""_blank"">Beat Happening</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/"" target=""_blank"">Orange Juice</a>) to the less expected (like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11831-crass/"" target=""_blank"">Crass</a>).</p>
<p>Part of <i>Everything</i>'s success is that it follows the time-honored indie pop tradition of being short and sweet. Brevity and brisk pacing are characteristics the band seems quite familiar with: They manage to cram 15 tracks into a time frame of 29 minutes, with only three of the album's songs passing the 2:30 mark and none that even grazes three minutes. In fact, a few of the shorter tunes grind to a halt at completely unexpected endpoints, which is a jarring but effective way to get a listener's attention. The way these songs end doesn't make them sound unfinished in any way, but it's apparent that the band would rather not coast on a good riff or melody long enough to lose its luster.</p>
<p>Almost any band could take only the basic elements of indie pop and make a listenable album. Many, many bands already have. What makes <i>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sea Lions But Were Afraid to Ask</i> above-average is the band that made it, one willing to adjust its sound so it's slightly off-center, reverent of the past but not to the point where it completely hinders their ability to push things forward.</p></div>"|16282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16282-everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-sea-lions-but-were-afraid-to-ask/|7.4|Martin Douglas

The music on last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15020-cape-dory/"" target=""_blank"">Cape Dory</a></i> bobbed sweetly between Brill Building tunefulness and classic indie pop production values, and the basic lyrical themes were at least as old as jazz standard <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhKoFR7iD8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Sailboat in the Moonlight""</a>, hold the moonlight. But the sailing trip that inspired the Colorado-based band's debut also fulfilled something newer: the internet's need for easily digestible narrative. Luckily, core married couple Alaina Moore and Patrick Riley had a real knack for breezy, deceptively simple beach-pop that could get lodged in your head and inspire your own seafaring daydreams. Or at least make you jealous.</p>
<p>Another story would seem to apply to <i>Young and Old</i>, and it's the one about the ""difficult"" sophomore record. Musically, Tennis have broadened their horizons just the right amount, adding rock'n'roll muscle and a more purely pop clarity under the oversight of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"" target=""_blank"">the Black Keys</a>' drummer Patrick Carney, who produced. A few songs still hit at the sense of love-drunk reverie that turned older tracks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11924-marathon/"" target=""_blank"">""Marathon""</a> and ""South Carolina"" into blog and college-radio hits. But Tennis couldn't keep writing sailing songs forever, and the new batch doesn't pull us into their world quite as easily-- and it's not only for lack of convenient biographical shorthand. They've gone from under the boardwalk to stuck in the middle.</p>
<p>For all that, a whole lot of what's new here improves on the debut. Under Carney's direction, Tennis upgrade their sonics without losing the fuzz. In fact, sometimes there's even <i>more</i> fuzz, such as in the nicely clanging lead riff on the album's first advance mp3, sprightly piano-popper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12752-origins/"" target=""_blank"">""Origins""</a>. Moore's full-throated lilt and multi-hued keyboard, along with Riley's lissome guitar lines, still aren't that far down the innocent coast from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">Beach House</a>'s supine dream-pop, and now there are extra layers of vocal harmonies, such as the appealingly Free Design-jazzy sha-la-las on ""Petition"". But Carney especially brings life to the percussion, whether it's the huge handclaps on ""My Better Self"", a swooning standout reminiscent of the Owls' underrated mid-2000s indie-pop gem ""Air"", or the snapping snares on ""High Road"".</p>
<p>""Paradise is all around, but happiness is never found,"" Moore sings on that last song, which might've been a strong unifying theme for the sophomore album-- a melancholy flipside to the debut's paradise-is-paradise uplift. Sure, the songs on <i>Young and Old</i> occasionally bring back the romance of movement (optimistic ""Traveling""), and they're often introspective, but instead the effect tends to be too confused, stilted, or generic to really pack the same wallop. The album's first words, on mellow strummer ""It All Feels the Same"", are ""took a train,"" a potentially intriguing counterpart to sailing that isn't properly explored elsewhere on the record. Rather than at sea or on the railroad, the lyrics lean toward awkward abstraction: ""Will you make my children bear the consequences everywhere?"" asks ""Origins"". Even on ""My Better Self"", Moore philosophizes clumsily, ""What is innate, I do not know/ But meaning comes and it goes.""</p>
<p>She sort of has a point, though. As easy as it is to criticize acts that come to us with a ready-built narrative alongside their music, storytelling and image-making have always been crucial elements of pop. What matters isn't whether a record comes with extra-musical buzz attached, but whether the music is good enough to capitalize on that buzz. <i>Cape Dory</i>, to my ears, was; <i>Young and Old</i> is another example of a promising young act that found an audience quickly on the internet before fully coming into its own powers. In other words, it's pretty good, but also a bit disappointing. There's still plenty of time, though, and by album three, the duo that never originally set out to make music will have something else that can be invaluable for a working band: a little more experience in the trenches.</p></div>"|16252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16252-young-and-old/|6.3|Marc Hogan

He should, probably: A broad definition of ""loop"" would encompass every single component piece of Wilner's work, especially given his fondness for manicured sampling as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"" target=""_blank"">the Field</a>. His third Field album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15790-looping-state-of-mind/"" target=""_blank"">Looping State of Mind</a></i>, dropped last fall, and here he returns as Loops of Your Heart, a new project in the vein of the masters of German electronic music from whom he takes many of his cues.</p>
<p>I'm always surprised, when revisiting the Field albums, how fast the tracks are. Willner's tempos blur his loops into proto-trance, and they would sound furious if they weren't so pretty. On <i>And Never Ending Nights</i>, Willner slows his roll. His loops, instead of being swept into currents of sound, ripple in muddy puddles. The result is a small and willing homage to the earthen psychedelia of artists like Ash Ra Tempel, Cluster, and Klaus Schulze.</p>
<p>It's an attractive position for Willner to take: The Field records are airtight and modern, rarely betraying influence. <i>Never Ending Nights</i> is too sober to effect the Martian moonscapes of those early electronic masters: It is compact in concept and execution. Where Tangerine Dream and Ash Ra Tempel allowed their instruments to fever for 20 and 30 minutes, Willner attacks and releases precisely. Maybe we're all inured to these extended, chapped arpeggios, or perhaps Willner is too tethered to his predecessors, but <i>Never Ending Nights</i> settles into a comfy pocket somewhere between motorik patter and ambiet drift.</p>
<p>Willner is most successful when he tunes one of his sequencers to a snake-y rhythm. ""Broken Bow"" clangs and quivers for three minutes before a prowling synthesizer and growling guitar feedback hijack the track. ""Lost in the Mirror"" is too simple and good to screw up: a phasing arpeggio tickles the red as saucers hover. It is one excellent note. But if Willner seems in exact control of rhythmic elements, he's less certain of glacial ones. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12837-neukolln/"" target=""_blank"">""Neukölln""</a> and ""Cries"" both lack conviction, trusting the lapping tones of his keyboards to provide both beauty and structure.</p>
<p><i>Never Ending Nights</i> does contain one truly modern moment. During the opening minutes of ""Little You, You Should Develop""-- a pretty, faded bauble-- titular electronic splinters rise from the background. It's the singular sound-- I kid you not-- of a cell phone brushing too close to a speaker (and just as you check for flashing lights while driving and listening to hip-hop, so too will you check the location of your phone). Loops of Your Heart isn't as darkly imaginative as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28508-black-to-comm/"" target=""_blank"">Black to Comm</a> or as committed as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a>, and we are long past the point where we can call this manner of composition ""experimental."" Willner, though, is an able synth scientist and a reverent listener.  <i>Never Ending Nights</i> contains just enough detail to save it from pastiche and in doing so offers a glimpse into Willner's influences.</p></div>"|16264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16264-and-never-ending-nights/|7.1|Andrew Gaerig

In the mid-2000s, the Futureheads, Bloc Party, and Arctic Monkeys all released exciting debuts. And there was enough connective tissue between the groups to make them feel like they somehow belonged together-- shared post-punk influences helped in that regard. These bands made sense both in isolation and as a whole; <a href=""http://www.themaccabees.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Maccabees</a> debut record, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10355-colour-it-in/"" target=""_blank"">Colour it In</a></i>, slotted just fine on the racks next to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx00NuMSipc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maximo Park</a>.</p>
<p>In 2012, the world of indie bands in the UK is more fractured, and the Maccabees struggle to find a foothold. They are the sort of band that looks much better in a throng. There's nothing especially remarkable about them and, at this point, they feel like a reflection of the stalled state of British indie music in general. Perhaps as a way to shake things up, the band's third record, <i>Given to the Wild, </i>looks to the sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7372-wild-beasts/"" target=""_blank"">Wild Beasts</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5720-foals/"" target=""_blank"">Foals</a>, two of the few real UK indie success stories of the past couple of years. On a similar tip they also enlist <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH9CRW5oItE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tim Goldsworthy</a> of DFA fame to produce, though there's very little you would usually associate with him on this record.</p>
<p>Setting aside the obvious grabs from other bands and sounds, there are moments where the darker hues suggest that this is in fact a more interesting direction for the Maccabees. ""Child"", for example, revolves around an elastic bassline, brass, and descending guitar patterns, and the harmonies are nicely laid for the first couple of minutes. The sense of restraint is effective, allowing enough space to open up for each of those pleasing elements, but then the final couple of minutes spoil things, especially when an uninvited gaudy, prog-guitar line crowds the party.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on <i>Given to the Wild, t</i>he Maccabees grasp for big sounds and big ideas but fall way short. On ""Forever I've Known"", singer Orlando Weeks does his best Win Butler impression, and it's so accurate you could be forgiven for checking the liner notes for a guest appearance credit. It doesn't stop with the voice either. Weeks also mines classic Arcade Fire tropes with his lyrics-- mortality, time, loss-- but there's no narrative, just a jumble of barely connected platitudes and simplistic resolutions such as, ""Forever I've known, nothing stays forever."" They shoot for the bigger picture again on ""Pelican"", but there's no insight or depth to clichés such as, ""One thing's for sure, we're all getting older"" and ""Before you know it, pushing up the daisies"". These are sentiments that would feel banal on a Facebook news feed, let alone an album by a major label recording artist.</p>
<p>Any hint of an interesting idea or sound on this record has been done better by somebody else-- and quite recently, too. Surely there's nobody that would trade the rich textures and awkward sexual drama of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnInP4bEKaU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Plaything""</a> by Wild Beasts for a bland quickie with anything on <i>Given to the Wild</i>. The personalities on this album are so blank the songs may as well be performed by apps, and sung by Siri. The overriding message you get from <i>Given to the Wild</i> is that life is too short. As it clocks in at nearly an hour, but feels much, much longer, you finally think they might have a point.</p></div>"|16279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16279-the-maccabees-given-to-the-wild/|4.0|Hari Ashurst

Like their North East England brethren <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1623-the-futureheads/"" target=""_blank"">the Futureheads</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2956-maximo-park/"" target=""_blank"">Maximo Park</a>, the duo had a penchant for playing cut and paste with clichés-- paying melodic homage to Paul McCartney, but going art-school with its song form.</p>
<p>But when the band's core members, brothers Peter and David Brewis, re-emerged from a three-year hiatus in 2010, it seemed like they had ironed out their reservations about straightforward rock'n'roll. Not only was their comeback record, <i>Measure</i>, a double album-- the true standard for rock excess-- but it found them writing full-fledged songs, complete with verses, choruses, and guitar solos.</p>
<p>That's all over now, though. Field Music's latest album, <i>Plumb</i>, finds them returning to the deconstructionist impulses that guided their earliest records. With 15 songs in 35 minutes, this is Field Music at their most baroque-- a record of sweetly melodic miniatures that coalesce into form only long enough to tumble into the next meticulously designed song suite.</p>
<p>Over the years, Field Music have become the world's leading ambassadors of the a distinctly British musical style, that of quaint suburban sensibility shot through with a dry self-depreciating sense of humor. The album's first three songs-- ""Start the Day Right"", ""It's Okay to Change"", and ""Sorry Again, Mate""-- tumble into one another, linked through a series of brain-teasing time signatures and transitions. But the subject matter is the stuff of the workaday world. ""Trying to beat the traffic, meet the train only guessing the time,"" sings David, pondering his commute over solemn piano chords.</p>
<p>""Choosing Sides"" navigates between an odd time verse and a straight-laced chorus before jettisoning both feels for a buttoned-up take on electro funk. ""I want a different idea of what better can be that doesn't necessitate having more useless shit,"" sings like a man who has come to a tough impasse with an Ikea instruction manual. For Field Music, quiet desperation is still the English way, even when they're riffing on Prince.</p>
<p>They're better at this stuff now than they used to be, though. The band's first releases, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3344-field-music/"" target=""_blank"">Field Music</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9812-tones-of-town/"" target=""_blank"">Tones of Town</a></i>, plied the same cut and paste techniques with less success. One plinky keyboard part gave way to the next, often with little to help distinguish between ideas. Plumb has more dynamic. Where older Field Music songs used to rely heavily on static keyboard riffs, they've learned to strip down and leave space for the drums tug the song forward. Each song-snippet sounds distinct and fully realized.</p>
<p>But it's a bit disappointing to see the Brewis brothers walk away from <i>Measure</i>'s more conventional approach. That record's best moments, like the shimmering Big Star homage, ""You and I"", were patient and spacious. <i>Plumb</i> is a little too fussy. Great hooks rise up, but are quickly abandoned in the rush to the next good idea. Taken out of context, <i>Plumb</i>'s best songs don't stand on their own quite as well. It's better to take them on all at once in single gulp.</p></div>"|16278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16278-field-music-plumb/|7.3|Aaron Leitko

Listening back to Phuture's epic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKbLI8EufNo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Acid Tracks""</a> outside of a club environment can push you into a cold, harsh, solitary state of mind. It's not quite the sound of dance music retreating from its inclusionary vibe, as packed dancefloors spread out over innumerable acid revivals can testify. But early acid tracks like Lil' Louis' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0a8YCL9Kek"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Video Clash""</a> and Armando's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEoCfCdmswg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Downfall""</a> point inward more than they do outward, accelerating away from the hands-in-the-air solidarity of club culture and into a far more isolated space.</p>
<p>Most of the acid revivals over the years have disengaged from that side of the genre-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1463-fatboy-slim/"">Fatboy Slim </a>and the big beat movement of the mid-to-late 1990s took all the slippery twists of the Roland TB-303 and funneled them into happier, stadium-filling anthems. But lately there's been a small band of musicians picking up on the raw, untrammeled nihilism of the earliest acid house tracks, singling out the sheer brute force of its core components and fusing them with outside influences. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30051-factory-floor/"">Factory Floor</a> are the most high profile among them, single-handedly creating their own new acid underground with additional nods to pop, industrial, and the clear-lines aesthetic of their partial namesakes, Factory Records.</p>
<p>In New York, the Venezuelan electronic musician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1860-carlos-giffoni/"">Carlos Giffoni</a>, mostly known for his excursions into noise, has spent the last few years digging into a similar set of influences. His No Fun Acid project, named by mashing up components of his No Fun festival and record label with his obvious debt to the sound of DJ Pierre and his cohorts, was flooded with tinny pitter-patter drum patterns and the burbling screeches of a thoroughly agitated 303. On ""Evidence"", a two-song 12"" for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"">Ford &amp; Lopatin</a>'s <a href=""http://softwarelabel.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Software</a> label, Giffoni takes the next logical step in the evolution of that sound, imprinting more of his personality on the work by cloaking it in the nebulous textures of his prior output.</p>
<p>In a recent installment of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/8766-regression-is-a-virtue/"">Out Door</a>, Marc Masters highlighted how a number of mainstays in the noise scene have retreated from all-out sonic assault, turning to quieter corners for inspiration. ""Evidence"" ties into that trend, beginning with a simple piano and vocal piece that mirrors the feeling his label boss, Daniel Lopatin, as Oneohtrix Point Never, conjured up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/233-antony-and-the-johnsons/"">Antony</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11957-returnal-ft-antony/"">""Returnal""</a> in 2010. From there, Giffoni coats the track in an inflexible block of acidic sound and his detached, colorless vocal, creating a jarring juxtaposition between delivery and verse (""it would be so easy to fall in love with you""). It's sparse and unrelentingly downbeat, with a few cracks of light hacked into the murk by guest player <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28822-laurel-halo/"">Laurel Halo</a>, credited with ""manually mechanized piano and synth riffage.""</p>
<p>The other track here, ""Desire in the Summer"", is similarly drained of emotion, sounding like the slashed-up noise passages from Giffoni's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9867-arrogance/"">Arrogance</a></i> slowly sinking into battle with his new acid impulses. Again, his bone-dry delivery percolates throughout, positioning him as a survivor standing in the rubble as two genres go to war around him. This is a departure for Giffoni, even from the more club-friendly No Fun Acid project.

It's the latest in series of personas for rapper Ninja, né Watkin Tudor Jones, but even with that conceptual bent in mind, it's still hard to process Die Antwoord as an idea, <i>especially</i> on <i>Ten$ion</i> where they replace what made them sometimes intriguing and slightly subversive with tired and tropes and lazy lyrics. In some ways it's the worst of both worlds: We've seen and heard it all before, and now it's dumbed-down even further. The blunt simplicity of <i>Ten$ion</i> could be seen as the mastery and refinement of a fledgling aesthetic (stupid for the sake of stupid). But this is a step back. Whatever cultural interrogation Die Antwoord might have been performing with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14766-o/"" target=""_blank"">$O$</a></i>-- and it was hard to tell-- is totally absent here.</p>
<p><a href=""http://dieantwoord.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Die Antwoord</a> abandoned their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44553-die-antwoord-split-with-interscope-release-new-video/"" target=""_blank"">deal with Universal</a> because of perceived pressure to be ""like everyone else out there at the moment,"" and it's immediately clear from <i>Ten$ion </i>opener ""Never Le Nkemise 1"" that their sound has gotten a whole lot more... expensive. Earlier tracks like as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1139-enter-the-ninja-explicit-version/"" target=""_blank"">""Enter the Ninja""</a> and ""Wat Kyk Jy?"" hinted at big-room ambitions but still sounded endearingly cheap and shoddy. But ""Never Le Nkemise 1"" begins with a blockbuster-worthy bit of string-led melodrama and pseudo-choral vocals and quickly slams down into a-- what else?-- dubstep throwdown, all fiery blazes of scorched-earth LFO threatening to drown out Ninja's screeches of ""that's why we keep it motherfucking gangsturrrrr!""</p>
<p>Say what you want about this zany group of South Africans, but attention-grabbing early singles like ""Enter the Ninja"" at least showed a clever dimension to their sound, with quick-fire raps that were easy enough to get swept up in. But there's nothing remotely thought-out or careful about <i>Ten$ion</i>. Not that anyone expected <i>subtlety</i> from Die Antwoord, but this is id rap at its worst, and even their excess lacks scope or imagination.</p>
<p>By its very nature, the Die Antwoord project is style-over-substance, but <i>Ten$ion</i> goes out of its way to prove that point. The boasting shouts of ""'EY SEXEE, 'EY SEXEE"" on the chorus of ""Hey Sexy"" are hopelessly awkward, and Ninja's Ludacris crib, ""Get out the bitch, get out the way,"" feels like an embarrassingly misguided attempt at relating this duo to mainstream hip-hop currency-- a decade too late. If their lyrics are emptier than ever (""I took drugs at the age of 13/ Jesus Christ/ What the fuck?""), their attempts at shock value ring disturbingly hollow. If you aren't getting a little restless by the album's ending stretch, ""DJ Hi-Tek Rulez"" might snap you out of a cock-eyed stupor with its gruff, digitally altered grunts of ""DJ Hi-Tek will fuck you in the ass... You can't touch me, faggot,"" amid other violently homophobic slurs. There's no shortage of allowances made for this kind of stuff in hip-hop, on an album this silly and concerned with dumb, thoughtless fun, it's especially troubling. It doesn't sound <i>anything</i> like a joke in the impenetrably convoluted layers of irony and self-mythologizing that is Die Antwoord.</p>
<p>What are we left with then? Die Antwoord were stuck with the ""rave-rap"" tag from the beginning, and it wasn't too bad a description, emphasizing not only the trio's danceability and playfulness but also its stark-raving-mad, go-for-broke tendencies. But this time around, the emphasis is on the ""rave."" Which is great for the in-house production but detrimental to pretty much everything else. The songs here are even less collected than before, jumping from flashpoint to flashpoint in a frenzied hunger to see how many times they can climax in each four-minute chunk of energy. It's exhausting, and the fragmentary, dissociative scatter takes the vitality and primacy out of the music. For a band so obsessed with its own self-consciously humorous image, <i>Ten$ion</i> in part fails because it feels so strangely humor<i>less. </i></p>
<p>So while they might have succeeded in their quest to bypass the constraints of major-label rules and pressures-- apparently Universal rejected the album for being too vulgar-- they've gone and picked the most unfortunate parts of their oversized, manufactured personalities to highlight. <i>Ten$ion</i> is proof that you need more than just aesthetic and press savvy to really get by. They might have left their potentially comfortable new home to forge their own path, but Die Antwoord sound like they have no idea where they're going.</p></div>"|16270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16270-tenion/|4.2|Andrew Ryce

Let's call this an album, OK? In any case, <a href=""http://lookingforgold.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fucked Up</a> have been releasing long songs for each year of the Chinese Zodiac since 2006, although they're running a little behind at the moment. (The Year of the Tiger ended in February 2011; we've passed through the Rabbit Year and are now in the Dragon Year.)</p>
<p><i>Year of the Tiger</i> is a pair of tracks that have been around for a while-- the band claimed to have finished the title song <a href=""http://lookingforgold.blogspot.com/2010/04/year-of-tiger.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">almost two years ago</a>. It's the first music we've heard from the band in a while that doesn't have some formal connection to their <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15513-david-comes-to-life/"" target=""_blank"">David Comes to Life</a></i> project. ""Year of the Tiger"" itself is a 15-minute song with a very long lyric (apparently by guitarist Mike Haliechuk) about an aging tiger approaching his death. Fucked Up's lead bellower Damian Abraham gets most of the words to himself, although he's also got some support: former Del-Byzanteens singer/keyboardist <a href=""http://www.jimjarmusch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jim Jarmusch</a>-- yes, fine, he's a director, too-- intones a few verses, and either Annie-Claude Deschênes (of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28734-duchess-says/"" target=""_blank"">Duchess Says</a>) or Katie Stelmanis (of <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/29292-austra/"" target=""_blank"">Austra</a>) or both add the pretty hey-I-can-actually-sing vocals that FU have been using for contrast with Abraham's voice over the past few years.</p>
<p>The marvelous thing about ""Year of the Tiger"" is that it's actually a fully constructed song, not a vamp-with-solos or a chain of vaguely related pieces segued together; it builds and builds and builds, with one new riff after another uncoiling itself and wrapping around the pillar of all the others. It's bombastic as hell, of course-- the keyboard part is the closest Fucked Up have ever come to Meat Loaf-- but this is the product of a band that thinks <i>big</i>. The song's weak point is its lyrics, which have lots of sharply observed images (""his castle of gristle and bone""), but also too many passages with dodgy or overwrought diction (""that deathly coddle of light""). Abraham's guttural howl is a great equalizer of lyrics, but the sung sections reveal the words' awkwardness: Lines such as, ""Light drips like paint from heaven/ A shining pall on the horizon,"" are easier to get away with screamed than chirped.</p>
<p>Fucked Up's <a href=""http://lookingforgold.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> describes the second side of <i>Year of the Tiger</i>, ""Onno"", as ""a weird rager,"" which is about right. It appears to be a full-on 22-minute instrumental palindrome, a pyramidal stack of drones and riffs with a crashing forward-and-backward beat-- the closest thing they've ever produced to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"" target=""_blank"">Melvins</a>' more extreme recordings, or to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-FhhWrgjf0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hüsker Dü's ""Dreams Reoccurring""</a>. For a ""studio experiment,"" it's exceptionally listenable: Again, this band is great at arrangements, and every five-second segment of this record sounds almost but not quite like the one next to it. If it were in a movie soundtrack, it'd have to be in a sequence with a violently strobing red light. It's too much, too much, too much-- exactly what we rely on Fucked Up for, that is. Who would ask for anything less?</p></div>"|16267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16267-fucked-up-year-of-the-tiger/|7.5|Douglas Wolk

And it's a surprisingly cohesive work considering that it was recorded in several different countries and sutured together from singles and B-sides that have been around since 2010. So yeah, <i>Melt</i>-- that's a great word for Young Magic's debut, but ""blur,"" ""smear,"" or ""dissolve"" would also be acceptable.</p>
<p>I suppose it goes without saying that <i>Melt </i>might inadvertently align itself with hyphenated genres many of you are looking to conscientiously avoid. It's a reductive, but not completely off-base, assumption. Sure, these tracks are underpinned by West African rhythms (""The Dancer""), Brainfeeder's non-quantized drum smacks (""Sanctuary""), and the stutters of dubstep (""Drawing Down the Moon""). But for all of the trio's globe-trotting origins (two are Australian ex-pats, one is a native Indonesian, and all have traveled to multiple continents), there's an introversion and physical distance which bring to mind kids looking for the perfect beat while hunched over samplers and laptops in their apartments.</p>
<p>But while the reverb is ample and the edges are soft, it's a choice more functional than fashionable, a conscious production decision to solder together disparate sounds into a textured whole. The rare times they're present, guitars are tremeloed and processed to sound like balalaikas as opposed to chorded instruments, and while the melodies are often pumped out by harsh, exaggerated synths, the percussion most often takes the tone of household objects-- rattling coins on ""Sparkly"", pitched water jugs on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12583-slip-time/"" target=""_blank"">""Slip Time""</a>, alarm clocks and cell phones elsewhere.</p>
<p>It's a cushy listen, if not only always distinctive, particularly since the shorter tracks often amount to a cooled, deep-blue gelatin that holds the previously released singles together. But those three tracks instantly stand out less because of their familiarity and more because it's where Young Magic really leans into the listener rather than kicking back. Aggression isn't really their game, so the chain-gang lurch of ""Sparkly"" effectively starts <i>Melt </i>on a slowly menacing opening note, while the warped war chant of ""You With Air"" undergoes subtle digital damage that gives it tonal ambivalence. The centerpiece <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12456-night-in-the-ocean/"" target=""_blank"">""Night in the Ocean""</a> has a fairly self-explanatory title, but an accurate one-- at once pulverizing and pristine, it's an HD stunner amidst mostly Hipstamatic surrounding. These are also the best showcases for the interplay of Young Magic's vocalists: Melati Malay's coo flutters and glides as more of a shoegazey texture than a vessel for communication, and while certainly not as pretty, Isaac Emmanuel has something of a wounded half-rap that's ultimately more distinctive. Particularly when they trade off stoned mutters and airy ecstasy on ""Night in the Ocean"", you could imagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27383-salem/"" target=""_blank"">Salem</a>, had they formed during the best semester abroad ever.</p>
<p>But <i>Melt </i>can just as easily be seen as pragmatic, offering solutions to questions left unanswered by some of the more disappointing trajectories taken by fellow indie psych travelers who once called NYC home: Are you a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5506-yeasayer/"" target=""_blank"">Yeasayer</a> fan who instantly felt buyer's remorse the moment ""The Children"" introduced the wonky electro boondoggle <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13922-odd-blood/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Blood</a></i>? Wished <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5373-high-places/"" target=""_blank"">High Places</a> still sounded as, well, high as they did on their EPs? Just wanna see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27538-here-we-go-magic/"" target=""_blank"">Here We Go Magic</a> underwater? <i>Melt</i> has got your back. But those comparisons are every bit as useful for contrast-- you could get a sense of these bands' personalities beyond the manner in which they arranged their sounds, and it's tougher to parse what Young Magic have to say. Are Young Magic hippies? Naive adventurers? Shut-ins obsessed with looping pedals?  <i>Melt </i>conjures these admirable comparisons while avoiding any sort of concrete answer, but ultimately Young Magic can aspire to more by letting us know where they're coming from in a figurative sense.</p></div>"|16225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16225-young-magic-melt/|6.8|Ian Cohen

If you're looking for someone who's been there, done that, and has all the scars to prove it, Fetisch is your man. He's spun records at Danceteria and Tunnel in New York; recorded at Conny Plank's legendary Cologne studio; found himself at the epicenter of the original illegal rave boom in England; and worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5842-manuel-gottsching/"">Manuel Göttsching</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4285-tricky/"">Tricky</a>, and Ari-up from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"">Slits</a>. Their latest record even features a bizarre cameo from German horror and exploitation actor <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001424/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Udo Kier</a>. It's clearly a career that bears no particular focus or shape, with the many-sided tracks on <i>Hotel Amour</i> spinning off from the all-embracing approach Fetisch has gleefully wallowed in over the years.</p>
<p>As such, this is a record with a handful of standout songs struggling and straining against one another after being crammed into the standard album format. It feels like a collection of tracks screaming for individual attention, like precocious children all holding their hands up at the same time in class. The strength of Terranova's vocal collaborators are the primary cause of that, with Fetisch and &amp;ME drawing on some fiercely individual talent. Copenhagen-based singer Tomas Høffding leaves a sizable imprint, in particular on ""Question Mark"", which is positioned somewhere between the blubstep croon of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29297-jamie-woon/"">Jamie Woon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/233-antony-and-the-johnsons/"">Antony Hegarty</a>'s work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5681-hercules-and-love-affair/"">Hercules and Love Affair</a>. Elsewhere, the soft vocal intonations of Khan lend <i>Hotel Amour</i> the aura of post-rave comedown, particularly on the blissfully understated <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S79W7vd9xto"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""So Strong""</a>.</p>
<p>The stylistic thrust of this album is caught somewhere between the current and the deep past, with shades of modern pop production layered over the stripped-back grooves of vintage house. There aren't too many straightforward club bangers here, but there are a few old school thrills to be derived from the undulating TB-303 bass ripples of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwdZisBPG68&amp;list=UUO8kPhuIvah-r0OBjmsNAJw&amp;index=11&amp;feature=plcp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Want to Go Out""</a> and ""By My Side"". But taking such an unabashedly retro approach on certain tracks feels jarring when Terranova strive to be forward-thinking elsewhere. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdgfQEZmb6E&amp;list=UUO8kPhuIvah-r0OBjmsNAJw&amp;index=12&amp;feature=plcp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Take My Hand""</a>, the standout here, is all coarse, sputtering rhythms, clattering tin-pot drums, and heavily dubbed-out vocals. The closing ""Prayer"", featuring Kier's glowering spoken-word extracts and a straight-down-the-line piece of torch singing from German vocalist Nicolette Krebitz, is driven by the same kind of ambition <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22841-dj-hell/"">DJ Hell</a> was stirring up on his outstanding 2009 album <i>Teufelswerk</i>.</p>
<p>But those tracks are mostly anomalies, with too much of <i>Hotel Amour </i>sinking into territory that has been heavily mined in recent times. Billie Ray Martin gives an impressively robust vocal performance on ""Make Me Feel"", but there's nothing in the limp backing that elevates it beyond the bevy of pallid trip-hop clones that clutched hard to the coattails of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"">Massive Attack</a>'s <i>Blue Lines</i> 20 years ago. There's been a deluge of producers striving hard to work a darker edge into their material over the past decade, and it feels like it will take something very special to stand out in a marketplace bursting at the seems with alleyway-dwelling artists scrambling to translate early-morning post-ecstasy cityscapes into song. This isn't that record, but in ""Take My Hand"" and ""Prayer"", there is a way out of the gloom, providing some distance from the genre mimicry it ducks into elsewhere.</p></div>"|16273.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16273-hotel-amour/|6.0|Nick Neyland

Equal parts psych-folk songsmithery and musique concrète, the project came together when New Zealand's Daniel Beban, a multi-instrumentalist and tape artist, was chalking and splicing tape for a living at the BBC World Service. Intrigued by some discarded reel-to-reel tape machines he uncovered inside the station's studios, he began building compositions out of tape loops, and invited his guitarist friend Alexander Tucker to come jam.</p>
<p>Like their 2010 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14596-the-metallic-year/"" target=""_blank"">The Metallic Year</a></i>, the group's new record, <i>And They Turned Not When They Went</i>, reflects the slightly hallucinatory experiences that can arise from staying up very late at night and opening your ears. Recorded partly at the BBC's <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/institutional/2009/03/000000_bushhouse_name.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bush House</a>, and partly in a lighthouse in the marshy Dungeness region of Kent, it unfolds in a series of atmosphere-dripping vignettes, shuttling strangely and abruptly from ramshackle folk to astral ambience and the sounds of a bell striking the wee hours of the morning. <i>And They Turned Not When They Went</i> opens with the deep, resonant groan of London's Big Ben, gently folded into tape-manipulated whirs, loop-de-loops, and grinding drones.</p>
<p>But Imbogodom's music is more than just library-music clichés. Wherever they fall on the scale from abstraction to songcraft, the album's 10 tracks reflect a constant negotiation between sound manipulation and live instrumentation, or analog tape machine and guitar, cello, piano, vocals, drums, and any number of non-musical objects that one of the two members might happen to pick up. Songs trail off with cascading echoes that recall the transitions of dub music; notes are manipulated to take on new meaning.</p>
<p>The layered vocal line on album standout ""Heir Looms"", for example, is easily pretty enough to stand on its own, but it is all the more beautiful for the moments when it shifts abruptly, echoing into oblivion or pitched up an octave. Similar manipulations on ""Welcome Away"" transform a spoken word ""wrong number"" skit into a haunted phone call from the other side of the mirror, and extreme slowing of vox on tracks like ""Etchum Buoy"" and ""I Am Here, I Am Gone"" yields a cross between throat singing and the breathing of a sleeping creature. Listening to Imbogodom's second album, there's the<i> </i>feeling that, beyond its interest as a technical exercise, speeding or slowing a given sound can set something free within it.</p>
<p>Not all of the sounds here are easy on the ears, and the music can encompass discomfort, even ugliness. Cello can sound warm and rich or exposed and raw; the loose-skinned, off-kilter drum patter and tuneless guitar picking on ""Window Faces"" sounds like an intentionally clumsy attempt at an acoustic marching band. You may not feel pleasure all the way through <i>And They Turned Not When They Went</i>, but if you're drawn to the bizarre, inconstant emotional terrain of late-night wakefulness, you'll find something honest.</p></div>"|16275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16275-and-they-turned-not-when-they-went/|6.8|Emilie Friedlander

<p><i>The Singles</i>, their first hits collection, makes a virtue of their range. The 14-track set pares their catalog down to only their 12 most successful singles and two new recordings, resulting in a tight hour of their finest material sequenced like a dynamic, eclectic pop album. A few worthy singles didn't make the cut-- the joyous <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSdZAkA4VpA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Alive""</a>, the lushly psychedelic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjuPtkno5t0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Caravan Girl""</a>-- but concision trumps completism here, and chronology is tossed out in favor of cohesion.</p>
<p>Though Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory excel at crafting delicate, seductive ambiance, their most distinctive and influential music updates the aesthetics of glam rock with a harsh, electronic edge. Their electroclash-era breakthrough hits <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHnYe5Nj0F0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Train""</a> and ""Strict Machine"" are built upon a mercilessly tight schaffel beat that highlights the lyrical themes of decadence and submission. A number of songs from this period aimed for this sort of severe sexiness, but Goldfrapp nailed the tone by emphasizing elegance over sleaze, and by evoking complicated, often contradictory emotions rather than simply foregrounding a lewd subtext.</p>
<p>The cuts from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3506-supernature/"" target=""_blank"">Supernature</a></i>, their finest album, continue on with this general sound but loosen up to express giddy infatuation on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzfaJRDfveo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Number 1""</a> and sensual swagger on ""Ooh La La"", their most successful single to date. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFF8bubMc40"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ride a White Horse""</a>, perhaps their greatest song, contrasts their oppressive dominatrix beat with an ecstatic, airy chorus that provides a few moments of spiritual relief before returning to a lockstep that signals a barely repressed lust. Nearly a decade on, these tracks still sound fresh and futuristic, and despite generally getting lumped in with dance music, they point in a direction of new possibilities for glam rock.</p>
<p>With a body of work so focused on raw sexuality, it can be easy to overlook the emotional content of Goldfrapp's music. Alison's vocal performances tend to be rather understated, serving lyrics that deal with nuanced conflicts between pleasure and pain, or giving voice to desperate, lonely characters. ""A&amp;E"", the first single from their gentle, often bleak 2008 record, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11128-seventh-tree/"" target=""_blank"">Seventh Tree</a></i>, is an outstanding showcase for both her lyrical and vocal strengths as she sings from the perspective of an incredibly lonely woman driven to a suicide attempt while waiting around for a phone call from a man she's not even sure she likes. The details are rich and vivid, but the drama is muted, even as her voice hits a gorgeous crest at the song's peak.</p>
<p>Though Alison Goldfrapp is the star, her vocals often defer to the sound of Gregory's arrangements, which typically fill in the emotional range of the songs with melodic counterpoints and sonic detail. <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/emimusicpoland/goldfrapp-melancholy-sky-radio"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Melancholy Sky""</a>, one of the two new tracks on this compilation, is a prime example, with Alison's voice limited to minimalist phrasing as Gregory's synth-heavy orchestration climaxes like a fireworks display. Both of the new cuts call back to their delicate, loungey debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3504-felt-mountain/"" target=""_blank"">Felt Mountain</a></i>, but Gregory's approach has evolved with time, integrating elements of each record along the way. These songs may be a deliberate move to come full circle at the end of this retrospective set, but they could just as well point to a future in which the duo can comfortably let all aspects of its sound coexist on one record, as they do on this collection.</p></div>"|16261.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16261-the-singles/|8.4|Matthew Perpetua

The pressure here builds and builds, but rather than taking flight, tracks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12743-de-javu/"" target=""_blank"">""De Javu""</a> struggle with a misdirected explosion of percussion that flattens out into a farty bass riff smothered in layers of percussion. It's bloated, lifeless, and weighed down with its own multi-tracked mayhem, a thick, wet coat of gloss dragging propulsion down to a crawl more than anything else.</p>
<p>Excess is nothing new for Lindstrøm, but on <i>Six Cups of Rebel</i> he sounds lost. Synths layer endlessly and drums bang and clank-- this is some Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer shit-- but whatever power they might possess is lost as the clutter breeds a numbing sense of saturation. The breathing room that was essential to Lindstrøm's original charm, from the rattling drums of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHsoxSC93YE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Arp She Said""</a> to the exhilarating fly-bys of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtIDbi1p2vs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Where You Go I Go Too""</a>, is nowhere to be found, replaced by a suffocating blanket of midtempo muck. For an artist whose signature track's called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqiezz-Ahtc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Feel Space""</a>, it's disheartening to hear so little of it here.</p>
<p>His last album-length effort, 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13848-real-life-is-no-cool/"" target=""_blank"">Real Life is No Cool</a>, </i>a collaboratioin with singer Christabelle, showed that his luxurious disco could harbor vocals just fine (a theme that stretches all the way back to 2003's fantastic<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWwDK58jXHM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> ""Music in My Mind""</a>). But here Lindstrøm's own weak, garbled vocals are caught up in the soupy current of overdubs, strangled of momentum or melodic cohesion. Even worse, on ""Magik"", they're pitched-down into ugly, unnatural tones, one of those ""what could he have possibly been thinking"" moments made only worse by the creepy backing chorus that emerges halfway through. It's cringe-inducing, another misstep for a record that's already treading unsure ground.</p>
<p><i>Rebel</i> has a few nice moments. ""Quiet Place to Live"", which spends its first three minutes hobbling on an awkwardly uneven vocal hook complete with stabbing bursts of electric guitar, suddenly melts into a stunning keyboard breakdown halfway through. It's gorgeous in that silvery Lindstrøm way but completely aimless, drenching the track in generic prettiness that wears after a few bars: The vocals continue to clash and everything sounds strangely out of tune, as if he just dropped the organ carelessly on top of an entirely finished track. That brief glimmer of hope dissolves, defining the rest of the album as distinctly unmemorable, little drum fills and other pertinent details like specks of glitter on a gaudy neon canvas only adding to the fatigue. ""Call Me Anytime"" takes up a whole nine minutes, and I'll be damned if any of it's going to stick with me, as it cycles restlessly through a number of phases like it's desperately searching for some kind of magic glue to hold it all together.</p>
<p>The album finally picks up with 10-minute closer ""Hina"", an elongated horizon of shimmering keyboards and vocoders, anxiously pumping prog rock like the breakdown of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HxHwuiDPgk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pink Floyd's ""Dogs""</a> sculpted and smoothed-over into a disco edit. Shrouded in filters, Lindstrøm's vocals fit better here, and the track's relative tastefulness ends the album on a strange but refreshing note of restraint. Complacency is to be avoided, but the kind of step forward Lindstrøm tries here is a drunken, misguided one. The noxious muck on evidence here obscures most of what made his past music so singular.</p></div>"|16238.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16238-six-cups-of-rebel/|4.5|Andrew Ryce

Illegal downloading ruptured the already weak tendons of small independent labels.  Fans favored 1990s nostalgia over out-there artistry.  Top producers got tired of dealing with rap-biz bullshit and opted for MC-free experimentations with jazz, soul, and electronic. But my favorite theory is that most people got tired of rappers rapping about rapping.</p>
<p>Due to its nature as a reactionary sect, for the underground to evolve, it had to do something more than stand athwart history and yell, ""chill!!"" (In this re-enactment, William F. Buckley is played by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7234-krs-one/"" target=""_blank"">KRS-One</a>).  And there is no more elliptical act this side of a Steve Reich riff than writing lyrics about your lyrics. Yeah, it might have been a building block in the on-and-on-to-the-break-of-dawn days, but as George Harrison and Fatlip pointed out: All things pass. Swag will be ill before we know it.</p>
<p>Over the last 24 months, an ideology-free counter-culture rebuilt itself, waving different banners and maintaining few borders. It's an underground in lowercase letters, a constellation encircling everyone from Detroit amphetamine enthusiast <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a> to sardonic arsonists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a> and Open Mike Eagle, to anesthetized Oakland cloud rappers, to the Prosciutto-plumped adenoidal New Yorker <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a>, and the cold-hearted Hempstead Rambo, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29234-roc-marciano/"" target=""_blank"">Roc Marciano</a>. It includes older gods like Ishmael Butler (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28847-shabazz-palaces/"" target=""_blank"">Shabazz Palaces</a>/Digable Planets), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29-aesop-rock/"" target=""_blank"">Aesop Rock</a>, Brooklyn Bomb Squad scion <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"" target=""_blank"">El-P</a>, and the Dungeon Family's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5605-killer-mike/"" target=""_blank"">Killer Mike</a>. So fluid are its boundaries that the latter two did a record together funded by Adult Swim money.</p>
<p>Enter <a href=""http://newpro.homeboysandman.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sandman</a>. So anachronistic as to appropriate the slang, ""Homeboy."" Born name: Angel Del Villar. An ex-teacher, Ivy League undergraduate, and Hofstra Law student psychologically aligned to the older underground of 1995, when the term meant Beatnuts and <i>Do You Want More?!!!??!</i>, not Jurassic 5 and flip-flops. Sandman is the type of rapper beloved by hip-hop traditionalists: proudly old school, technically savage, and lyrically sharp. In the all-star game of the new subterranean, he is the guy with flawless fundamentals, wearing his socks high and his cleats sharp and polished.   So it was little surprise when the surviving infrastructure of the 1990s immediately supported Sandman: underground hip hop radio, the Nuyorican Poets Café, the XXL Chairman's Choice column, and rap's <i>Daily Worker</i>, Okayplayer. The straw poll was sealed when Sandman signed with Stones Throw, one of the last garrisons of the late 90s, an imprint blessed with the resources to shower him with proper promo, branding, and an array of dazzling sun- and smoke-carved beats.</p>
<p>East meets west on <i>Subject: Matter</i>, Sandman's debut EP for the label of Madlib and Dâm-Funk. To accompany the introduction, Sandman added a subtext to his six-song collection, noting on its cover that they encompass content that ""no one has ever rapped about before in the history of rap music. Unfortunately not a very difficult thing to do."" Sandman is as Queens as the Unisphere, and his braggadocio bears a boldness that suggests that he grew up in the Bridge not Elmhurst. It's probably unnecessary arrogant, but it also reflects a welcome sign of ambition. Few deducted points from Lil Wayne for boasting that he was the greatest rapper alive (even if 49 percent of the electorate disagreed). Nor should they blame Sandman much for his myopic history.</p>
<p>After all, the man can rhyme. A former saxman, Sandman takes a modal approach with his screwball flow that dips and dives, stops and starts. He bevels his patterns at bizarre angles, employing a vocabulary worthy of Lisa Simpson. He's unapologetic about his intelligence, and even if it skirts the line of pretension, he keeps a progressive approach. Not only does he carefully weigh the importance of ""being nice,"" he's focused on vivid storytelling too.   <i>Subject: Matter</i> is both a self-challenge and the hurling of a gauntlet. Sandman wants to see his peers expand their imagination. And while the modern-day rap world has no scarcity of songs channeling topics of the zeitgeist (the entirety of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15753-xxx/"" target=""_blank"">XXX</a></i>, 1/3 of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15725-watch-the-throne/"" target=""_blank"">Watch the Throne</a></i>, whatever you make of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"" target=""_blank"">Lil B</a>), his originality is warmly welcomed, if not demanded.</p>
<p>So though ""The Miracle"" parallels the storylines of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHv11H1xjt8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pharoahe Monch's ""Rape""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc8eD0prHIM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mos Def's ""Love""</a>, it offers a penetrating analysis of the act of creation from Sandman's side. ""Unforgettable"" tells the tale of the woe brought onto a man too sprung on his ex. It mirrors a less-graphic version of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RpDq3uwvDw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface Killah's ""Marvel""</a>, but Sandman spins his own saga of picking up mediocre girls at Best Buy and sexing them while reminiscing on his last conquest. ""Canned Goods"" is about canned goods. Closing track ""Soap"" pictures a biblical deluge washing away the inequities of the world.</p>
<p>The psychedelic, elegiac beats are handled by 2 Hungry Bros, Ben Grymm, the Audible Doctor, rThentic RTNC, and the latest Stones Throw rated rookie, Jonwayne. Despite the diffuse cast, the EP feels exceptionally cohesive; it's also a throwback to the days when A&amp;R departments actually existed. A half-decade ago, a record like this would've been needlessly over-hyped, with true-schoolers rushing to anoint Sandman the bulwark against an ineradicable tide of commercialism and greed. Now that the ""Hip Hop is Dead"" era's over, Sandman merely needs to be good. And he is.</p>
<p>With a healthy number of his peers engaged in shoving rap onto strange terrain, Sandman is another vivid character adding to the expansion.<i> Subject: Matter</i> might be Sandman's best work yet, but more importantly, it's a salient reminder that a song's only perimeter is the limits of human imagination.</p></div>"|16271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16271-homeboy-sandman-subject-matter/|7.7|Jeff Weiss

Though they'd hit the studio with frequent Elliott Smith collaborator Rob Schnapf with that oft-parroted aim of bringing their spirited live show to the recording booth, the outsider's presence helped the Philly rockers shave some of the shaggy excess from their earlier efforts, teasing out their bright, bouncy, McCartney-indebted melodies. Critics, largely resistant to Dr. Dog's retrograde charms, praised the disc; our own Zach Kelly rightly noted that its ""bigger, more charismatic sound"" felt like ""the work of a younger, wide-eyed outfit.""</p>
<p><i>Be the Void</i> arrives without the guiding hand of Schnapf, or anybody really; opting, as before, to go it alone, on its seventh LP, the band returns to the sunburnt sprawl of its first few records. You've got your big, bulbous melodies, your rattly unplugged strums, your mile-long solos; in vocalists Scott McMicken and Toby Leaman, you've got yourself a veritable two-man harmony factory stocked with enough whisky and cigarettes to get you through the spring. All this-- and what seems to be a fairly encyclopedic history of popular American rock music from, oh, 1968 through 1974-- are pretty much the same cards they've been shuffling since the start, but as Schnapf's work on <i>Shame</i> proved, they fare best when they're a little uncomfortable, when somebody's there to tell them no. Its melodies are, as ever, sturdy, its production warm and homespun. But too often, <i>Be the Void</i> finds Dr. Dog unleashed, letting their wilder ideas get the better of them.</p>
<p>Take ""Warrior Man"", a supposed practice-room pisstake now taking up space on a Dr. Dog record. Caught out somewhere between Black Sabbath, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cShYbLkhBc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Styx's ""Mr. Roboto""</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVwEwdIIZD0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paul Revere and the the Raiders' ""Indian Reservation""</a>, the song depicts some kind of interstellar junkyard Al Gore-type rattling around the dump for a longer-than-it-feels five minutes. It's not a bad little stomp they get going underneath the stoned sci-fi, but it's not enough to salvage this particular heap from its own silliness. Surely an outside presence would've told them to let the dopily one-note ""Warrior Man"" stay, at most, a B-side. Then there's ""That Old Black Hole"", a sort of sub-Paul Simon cliche-flipper (""there are eggshells on the floor; therefore, I never touch the ground,"" which, y'know, just makes good sense) too impressed with its own supposed cleverness to ever make a lick of sense. They've never been ace lyricists, but I do miss the neighborly, come-grab-a-beer vibe of their <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10069-we-all-belong/"" target=""_blank"">We All Belong</a></i> era; here, they seem to be going for some kind of vagueness-as-profundity business that rarely gets its point across. ""Let's just clear the air,"" McMicken sings on ""Over Here, Over There"", before adding ""I am over here, I'm over there."" This clears nothing, McMicken!</p>
<p>The melodic zig-zag and sly groove of ""Heavy Light"", the buzzing National steel beneath gospel-twang closer ""Turning the Century"", the room sound, and the warmth generated by McMicken and Leaman's voices as they come together in (yet another) harmony are all reasons to recommend <i>Be the Void</i>. But, for every moment of clarity, a rose-colored note of reverence for the past wafts in and threatens to blot out some of <i>Void</i>'s would-be bright spots. Though the jaunty ""Over There"" nicks the verse melody from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XyTpENuoCI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joe Walsh's ""Life's Been Good""</a> wholesale, by and large, any outright theft's been a bit better concealed. ""Big Girl"" is generically Stonesy, right down to the slight whiff of misogyny; ""Get Away"", meanwhile, locates the Seals &amp; Crofts at the heart of Fleet Foxes. And the rust-colored, harmony-doused, Beatles-meets-Band stuff's in full evidence here as well; creaky opener ""Lonesome"", a kind of <i>Scarlett</i>-style postscript to Hank Williams' immortal <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WXYjm74WFI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry""</a> (not, sadly, written from the whippoorwills' perspective), could've easily tumbled off of the back half of <i>Cahoots</i>. At the risk of getting all <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/paper-trail/8010-paper-trail-simon-reynolds/"" target=""_blank"">Retromania</a></i> on you, it's no crime in and of itself that Dr. Dog borrow liberally from the past; their trouble lies in what they do with the stuff. The answer, seven albums in? A resounding ""let it be.""</p></div>"|16268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16268-be-the-void/|5.7|Paul Thompson

Running through his past two releases, 2010's full-length <i>Full Circle</i> and his latest mini-LP, <i>Lineage</i>, is a series of songs titled ""Ann Arbor"", after the Michigan town that he grew up performing music in (another track off the latter, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12975-huron-river-drive/"" target=""_blank"">""Huron River Drive""</a>, takes its name from a stretch of road in Ann Arbor). Like so many recent albums by young, electronic-fixated musicians, <i>Lineage</i>'s cover is adorned with a faded photograph, but this one's far from an Instagram: It's a picture of Saginaw's great-grandfather's house in Hiroshima, circa 1916. On the back cover of <i>Lineage</i>'s vinyl release, you'll find a picture of said grandfather, taken at Grenada, Colorado's Amache Internment Camp during the period of Japanese-American internment that took place in the U.S. in 1942.</p>
<p><i>Lineage</i>'s musical contents look to the past for inspiration as well, and given the history that Saginaw's lined the walls of this release with, it would be understandable to anticipate a sort of dusty, archival crate-digging revisionism à la French-Vietnamese producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16051-chinoiseries-pt-2/"" target=""_blank"">Onra's <i>Chinoiseries</i></a>. However, <i>Lineage</i>'s sonic nostalgia is reaching to a different, chronologically closer point in time-- specifically, 2003, when fellow knob-twiddler Kieran Hebden dropped the influential <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3166-rounds/"" target=""_blank"">Rounds</a></i> under his Four Tet alias. <i>Rounds</i> (and a lot of proceeding music that sounded like <i>Rounds</i>) was affixed with the unfortunate-in-hindsight ""folktronica"" tag, primarily due to its expert meshing of glitchy-yet-pastoral textures and traditional instrumentation that took a left turn from the blippy ones and zeroes that marked IDM.</p>
<p>You could tag a fair amount of what Saginaw's done here as ""pastoral"", too. The quaint melodies and twinkling mechanisms of <i>Lineage</i> suggest a patient, natural beauty, one that fits his production capabilities far better than <i>Full Circle</i>'s stutter-and-swell instrumental hip-hop leanings. There's very little here that would stand out when removed from the release's context, the buzzed thrum of ""Field Trip"" being <i>Lineage</i>'s most out-and-out melodically bold moment. Don't mistake subtlety for a lack of playfulness, though: ""A Child's Mind"", easily the mini-LP's highlight, takes a tumbling drum set and transforms it into a coffee-house-clubby shake. In addition to being a producer, Saginaw is a drummer, and ""A Child's Mind"" excellently plays to his rhythmic strengths. No one's going to mistake a track like this for an actual band performing, rather than a glasses-wearing young person playing the role of digital alchemist-- but if you close your eyes and expand your imagination just a little, the whole thing almost <i>sounds</i> human.</p>
<p>That man-machine perfectionism is what makes <i>Lineage</i>'s concise neatness a step up from the charmingly ramshackle boom-bap of <i>Full Circle</i>, but Saginaw's natural competency is also his downfall. <i>Lineage</i>'s clean style and easily admirable sound might seem refreshing when taken into context with the teeming pot of acid-stained, bunk-bed J Dilla imitators that continue to clog up RSS feeds with poorly-tagged MP3s and 1980s-sitcom-referencing artwork, but the fact of the matter is that <i>Lineage</i> isn't the first record to sound like <i>Lineage</i>. Understand that I'm not knocking Saginaw for being unoriginal, necessarily, especially since the results are quite enjoyable-- but the fact remains that, both within the Ghostly label's roster and when taking into account the bedroom electronic scene as a whole, listening to capable replicas of yesteryear is starting to lose its luster. Clearly, Saginaw has plenty of reverence for the past, and that's fine-- but something that sounds like the future, well, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ikegbrMojE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wouldn't that be nice</a>?</p></div>"|16269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16269-lineage/|6.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a> became a coffee-table favorite, they disappeared for years, overhauling their sound with the jagged lines of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11438-third/"">Third</a></i>. Air went in the other direction. They were too locked-down in the detached journey they were committed to, resulting in bland and dispassionate albums like 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13503-love-2/"">Love 2</a></i>. This record, a soundtrack to the restored, hand-colored version of the classic Georges Méliès silent film <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000417/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Le Voyage Dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon)</a>,</i> is a diversion of sorts. It offers Air a chance to bring some of the artistry back into their music, to work at rediscovering the elegance within the sleek surface drift they often lackadaisically flop into.</p>
<p><i>Le Voyage Dans la Lune </i>is less light than its predecessor. There's a brawny thickness to the guitar line in ""Astronomic Club"", a spine-tickling ghostliness passing through ""Décollage"", a pile-up of electronics marching with resolve on ""Sonic Armada"". It's never less studied than Dunckel and Godin's prior work, but it feels like Méliès' imagery may have inspired them to rediscover the playful side of their personalities-- the side that once prompted them to release a remix album titled <i>Everybody Hertz</i>. By the time they got to <i>Love 2</i>, the understated joy of songs like ""Kelly Watch the Stars"" had all but vanished, replaced by vapid and overly serious stodge like ""So Light Is Her Footfall"".</p>
<p>After coasting in half-realized bliss for so long, Dunckel and Godin appear to be reaching into the past in order to go forward. In the <i>5-10-15-20 </i>interview, Godin talks about the curse of making ""shit records"" after you turn 40. Here, his coping mechanism for that, on a handful of tracks, at least, is to pluck a few ideas from the playful Air on prior records. ""Parade"" is all bright <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_Kingsland"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paddy Kingsland</a>-inspired analog synth bursts, chirping birdsong, and ruptured drum parts that bring the track to a stuttering halt. But it's a retrogressive step, something this band has done before but better, fuller, and with a greater sense of direction. Here, it feels like a pleasant yet unremarkable switch back to the past, the sound of Air staring into a half-empty well of ideas, on the verge of becoming their own tribute band.</p>
<p>It's a shame, because the collaboration with Victoria Legrand of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"">Beach House</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44827-listen-to-airs-collaboration-with-beach-houses-victoria-legrand-seven-stars/"">""Seven Stars""</a> seemed to bode well for this album. The percussion-heavy frame provides the edge that prevents the softer intonations from becoming too fluffy. There's a marrying of militaristic thrust, snug vocal cooing, and a gloriously silly spoken-word countdown halfway through. For a minute it feels as if there are a few cracks in the veneer, which is generally the space from which all the best Air material's gathered. When they lower their guard and open their music up to unexpected elements, it causes the professorial approach to melt away. It makes sense that Dunckel was a mathematics teacher. Air's songs often sound like formulas spread out upon a page, with its makers puzzling over them, trying to figure out why they don't quite add up.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <i>Le Voyage Dans la Lune </i>is an unsteady mixture of partially inspired notions reaching for a purpose. It's a bountiful collection of loose ideas, hanging in the breeze without forging forward in any meaningful direction. ""Who Am I Now?"" is representative of the problem, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4822-au-revoir-simone/"">Au Revoir Simone</a> providing nebulous vocals that touch on the kind of spectral folk the <a href=""http://ghostbox.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghost Box</a> label so effectively delivers. But this feels like a facsimile of that work, and a poorly made one at that. It's too calculated, too studious. It's music reduced down to its raw components with all the mystery torn out. There are parts of the record that get back to the potential this band once possessed-- a slight return to interlacing all the best parts of Moog demonstration records, hoary old prog moves, and extravagantly deluxe production techniques. But back then they made it seem so easy. Here, it feels like they're trying too hard.</p></div>"|16255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16255-le-voyage-dans-la-lune/|5.7|Nick Neyland

As it pertains to <i>Live From the Kitchen</i>-- the rapper's first major-label album, despite having been in the game for over a decade-- the answer might as well be no. To be fair, 16,000 people bought it in its first week, but amongst his fans, there's little doubt that <i>Live</i> instantly took a backseat to the mixtapes and tracks that preceded it. That's something close to a shame, because it's a solid, listenable, blue-collar rap album, the sort of thing that used to start careers as opposed to branding them dead on arrival.</p>
<p><i>Live From the Kitchen</i> sounds like a professionally mastered mixtape, which explains why it succeeds artistically while failing commercially. On the one hand, Gotti stays in his lane, repeating the textbook trap music that he's been pumping out for years with slight updates from producers du jour like Lil Lody and Mike Will. On the other, the updates are <i>very </i>slight, and any of these songs could be dropped into an installment of Gotti's <i>Cocaine Music </i>mixtape series without anyone being the wiser-- it's hard to expect many people to pay for something that they've routinely been given for free over the course of a few years.</p>
<p>It is that consistency that is Gotti's calling card, and he carries it over to <i>Live From the Kitchen </i>with ease. He is a classic example of a rapper succeeding as much for how he sounds when saying something as opposed to what he says, but his lyrics have a striking directness that has allowed him to build the type of grassroots fanbase that can serve as a livelihood, even if they don't show up to retail stores. ""Testimony"", the album's opening track, is a perfect example: Not only does Gotti sound inherently right over DJ Montay's synth horns, but the outlining of his upbringing as a street dealer features no hint of braggadocio or cinematic theatrics. The tone isn't as much somber as it is unflinchingly matter-of-fact, which is an approach that still holds its appeal even during the reign of Rick Ross.</p>
<p>But the corollary here is that, although Gotti can easily work off of this blueprint, he rarely, if ever, transcends it. As far as dealers-turned-rappers go, there's a reason why he has never reached the heights of T.I. or Young Jeezy or Gucci Mane. He has neither the personality nor the pop instincts of those guys, and that becomes a problem over the course of a full-length. Tracks like ""Harder"" and ""Cases"" are perfectly fine Southern rap records, but for the top songs on the album, they're distinctly void of anything that would make them standout amongst a deluge of similar-sounding songs that flood the market on a routine basis.</p>
<p>Maybe the fate of <i>Live From the Kitchen</i>-- which, just to really hammer it home, had its lead single released in May of 2009-- is merely illustrative of the industry being the survival of the fittest. But it's hard not to sympathize a bit with Yo Gotti, who willingly entered into the major-label system because, well, that's just what rappers do, even though his fate seemed more or less preordained from the start. His debut album as a ""rap star"" will be followed by many mixtapes that sound just like it and are basically just as good, but unfortunately for him, that works out way better for the listener than it does the artist.</p></div>"|16266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16266-live-from-the-kitchen/|5.6|Jordan Sargent

But a new anthology of Oram's work, drawn from over 400 tapes she left behind after her death in 2003, helps illuminate the depth and breadth of her legacy, suggesting her career as a kind of parallel history to electronic music's dominant narratives.</p>
<p>Oram's idiosyncratic methods and eccentric pursuits suggest the classic profile of the ""outsider"" artist, but she spent much of her career deep inside the system. When she was just 18, in 1943, Oram found work as a studio engineer at the BBC. Her official duties there were often unglamorous, but she took advantage of the studio to pursue her own experiments with magnetic tape and tone generators. The BBC's resources were actually quite meager, at least compared to the studios in European cities like Paris and Cologne, but Oram was resourceful: one story has her gathering all the BBC's tape machines together and working through the night on an electro-acoustic composition, then dismantling the array and putting its components back in their proper places before work the next morning.</p>
<p>Magnetic tape was a relatively recent medium, and electronic sound generation was still in its infancy, but Oram already grasped their enormous artistic potential. As she wrote in her 1972 book <i>An Individual Note: Music, Sound, and Electronics</i>, ""In my work I am not concerned with synthesizing orchestral sounds-- we have excellent orchestras for making those sounds. My interest is in making new sounds which are musical."" In 1957, she recorded the first all-electronic composition to be played on the BBC, and in 1958, she finally received funding to open an electronic-music studio, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Oram and her bosses had very different ideas about its purpose. She had imagined a research facility on par with the electronic-music studio at Cologne's NWDR or the Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concrete at Paris' RTF, but the BBC was less interested in avant-garde composition than sound effects and background music, regarding the Radiophonic Workshop-- so named to appease the musicians' union and other music departments at the BBC-- as a kind of sci-fi Foley studio. (Indeed, today, the Radiophonic Workshop is best known for the music and sound effects it produced for <i>Doctor Who</i>.) After just one year, Oram left the BBC, setting up her studio in a house in Kent.</p>
<p>There, she pursued a range of work, both personal and commissioned, including sound effects for Jack Clayton's 1961 film <i>The Innocents</i> and various television commercials. The commissions, combined with a research grant, helped fund her main project: a home-built apparatus called the Oramics Machine, a combination synthesizer and sequencer that generated sound waves by ""reading"" hand-painted film strips with a reverse-engineered oscilloscope.</p>
<p>It looked like a gigantic Meccano contraption, and it was, by all accounts, a tremendously complicated device. What's more, it was a perpetual work in progress, under constant modification; only Oram and the engineers she employed really understood it. It's unclear when she stopped using the machine. By the late 1980s, she told an interviewer that she had moved onto working with computers, although she remained intent upon designing a system to read hand-drawn inputs. She suffered a series of strokes in the 1990s, and she died in 2003. The Oramics Machine was left gathering cobwebs in Tower Folly, which fell into ruin.</p>
<p>The Oramics Machine was recently restored for the London Science Museum's exhibition <i>Oramics to Electronica: Revealing Histories of Electronic Music</i>, coinciding with a growing re-appreciation of her work. But no matter how much biographical detail comes to light, Oram and her work remain shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>This first volume of <i>The Oram Tapes</i>, compiled from a trove of over 400 tapes held by Goldsmiths College, reinforces that impression. Where 2007's <i>Oramics</i> 2xCD set brought together the quixotic warbles of her Oramics compositions with quirky genre studies and commercial commissions-- sound effects, advertisements for Lego and power tools-- this release emphasizes her darker, more minimalist and abstract sounds.</p>
<p>Across 44 tracks, the album is by turns hypnotic and jarring, veering from sinewy drones, suggestive of Kevin Drumm, to pieces that sound like icicles being cleared from the eaves of a wind-chime factory. The prevailing mood is dank and claustrophobic, however, fogged with clammy reverb and bristling with strange clicks and alien voices.</p>
<p>It sounds as futuristic as it did then, but don't expect hi-fi: despite mastering by renowned Berlin's Dubplates &amp; Mastering facility, the audio can be murky. It's not hard to believe that the original tapes lay moldering in a box for years before their restoration. But that sense of decay actually contributes to the emotional resonance of the music. There's a veiled quality to much of it, and a sense that there's so much more there than meets the ear, as frequencies melt into the ether.</p>
<p>The anthology is thin on data; few of the tracks have dates attached, and there's little information on what Oram was using to make a particular piece-- or even why. Experiments with pulse and delay rub up against musical sketches, spoken descriptions, even a recording of a baby's birth. Two tracks titled ""2001 Effects Tape"" were presumably intended as submissions to Stanley Kubrick's <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. It all raises the question of how much of this Oram intended as music, and how much the tracks are simply fragments of her work, sketches torn from a notebook. But the compilers have made the most of the jumbled source material. In the liner notes, they write, ""As most of the tapes in the archive contain limited factual information, descriptions or dates, a chronological assessment of Oram's work was impossible to present. It is for this reason that we chose to arrange the tracklisting with an emotional narrative in mind, as albums are often sequenced.""</p>
<p>They've succeeded here. Purely as a listening experience, it's wonderful. I've had it playing on nearly constant repeat during days of below-freezing temperatures in Berlin, and there are times when I can't decide if the music is the perfect complement to the climate or vice versa. It's both gripping and distracting, fading into the background and then jumping back out at you. In the few segments where Oram speaks, detailing her craft, it feels less like an archival document than a kind of relic, a spectral emanation. Recalling the early belief in the phonograph as a spirit medium, and keeping in mind Oram's own esoteric interests-- she began <i>An Individual Note</i> by suggesting that ""memory, music and magnetism will lead us towards meta-physics""-- only reinforces the idea that there's something truly auratic humming in the grooves.</p>
<p>In an Invisibile Jukebox feature in <i>The Wire</i>, People Like Us' Vicki Bennett said of Oram, ""A lot of her music has got a melancholy to it. It's like a sad machine that exists on its own planet and just sings to itself."" That likely has something to do with the way that Oram was tuned to her own, unique frequency, resonating at a pitch inaudible to few others in her time. <i>The Oram Tapes</i> reinforces the melancholy aspect of her work, but it also offers a kind of solace, drawing her planet closer to ours, and finally finding an audience for her one-of-a-kind music.</p></div>"|16262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16262-the-oram-tapes-vol-1/|7.4|Philip Sherburne

One doesn't always get the strongest sense of Betson the person through his tales of strip malls and cemeteries, close friends and faroff train whistles; at times, it seems his adornment-averse songs of permanence, of comings and goings, and of not wasting what little time you've got on earth are singing through him, rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>A few minutes longer and several shades ricketier, <i>After the Graveyard</i> begins with a whorl of ambient noise before Betson starts in with the strumming. Instrumentally, he largely adopts the ardent chug of Woody Guthrie, often opting to leave it at that; the resolute simplicity of this musical backdrop puts the focus squarely on his words, many of which he delivers in an intentionally guileless Guthrie-style ramble. Here, as on <i>Clear Skies</i>, Betson's channeling everyone from Libba Cotten to Conor Oberst, but indie rock's typical anxiety of influence doesn't really factor in here; these songs mean to be part of a tradition that goes well beyond Woody, and Betson does a fine job staying mindful of the past while placing his anxieties squarely in the present. ""Ode to Then"" contrasts ""the strip malls [and] the city halls"" with an ""old dusty road, riding trains, Old Tom Joad,"" later noting that ""one day the internet will be our version of the wild west."" Fundamentally an optimist, Betson seems to be suggesting, in his so-called ""songs of my home and songs of my friends,"" that things aren't really all that different now from the way they've ever been; we could just stand to find a few new ways of looking at them.</p>
<p><i>Clear Skies Over Black River</i> builds on the successes of <i>Graveyard</i>, with a cleaner sound and a more surefooted approach. Dialing back on the doubling-up Betson gave to many of the guitar-and-vocal lines on <i>Graveyard</i>, <i>Clear Skies</i> is played with a stark intimacy, often just Betson, his guitar, and echoes off the wall of his bedrooms. He's still hanging around tombstones, still singing about the place where the past meets the present, and still in an everyman's voice that suggests a serious lack of ego. But the stark, striking <i>Clear Skies</i> finds him developing a voice that speaks to a very particular kind of existential angst, that feeling where you know things should be better than they are but can't quite articulate why. On the haunting, Microphones-like highlight ""Cooking"" he asks, ""how can I live my life if I can't cook my own food?"" Sounding positively devastated by the prospect of never quite mastering Easy Mac, Betson's articulating his need for community, for support; later in the same song, he talks of changing around pronouns so there's no he, no she, just I. That old we-are-one, ""Kumbaya"" feeling? It's not quite that, but it's awfully close.</p>
<p>Betson reportedly kept <i>Graveyard</i> and <i>Clear Skies</i> mostly to himself before finally letting a few copies into the hands of friends. Listening to either, it's understandable; though not ""deeply personal"" in the typical bedroom-bloodlet fashion, these are rather revealing records, forefronting Betson's often tentative singing voice and his learn-by-doing approach to the 4-track. But these, at their heart, are songs for sharing; they may be laid down simply, but they're not demos, and there's a gathering strength in their stark presentations. Much like his once-and-former bandmate Patrick Stickles, Betson sometimes hits the wrong note to strike the right feeling; not always the easiest listening, perhaps, but never less than honest.</p></div>"|16263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16263-after-the-graveyard-clear-skies-over-black-river/|6.3|Paul Thompson

I saw them at New York City's Cake Shop, ground zero for still-forming indie pop bands, and they were bursting with energy that didn't quite make it into their record. The album's highlights-- ""Fifteen (Nothing Happened)"", in which lead singer and bassist Emma Kupa struggled mightily with her temptation to sleep with a 15-year-old, or ""Philadelphia"", where she waited a year to revisit an overseas fling in the titular city-- hit upon an acidic, wide-eyed middle ground. One their stellar, charming follow-up, they sound like a band who has figured exactly how to braid together the different corners of their record collection.</p>
<p>Their secret weapon, undoubtedly, is Kupa. Her voice is an endearingly sideways yowl, one that often finishes lines on an unexpected upward lilt. She also has a disarming way of expressing her nerdiness and horniness in the same awkward, honest breath. ""I can see it in your eyes, my eagerness is showing,"" she laments in ""051107"", a line that more or less encapsulates her blurting, clammy-hands appeal. ""Older Women"" is about just that: ""I hear you're into older women/ Do you know what you're doing/ When you take them on?"" she demands. She comes off like someone's older-than-you-think little sister, squirmy but direct about sex.</p>
<p>She has refined her songwriting voice from <i>The Noyelle Beat</i>, as well, so that no songs on this wry, sprightly album fail to keep the momentum. Kupa has a distinctly British-songwriter knack for lacing lyrics with hyper-specific information: ""Half Sister"" begins with, ""It must have been 20 years since I last saw you/ Throwing up Cherry-Aide in my father's car/ Now I find out you're living four streets down/ From your grandmother's Christmas cards,” and like a great Ray Davies song, you can feel whole lives sketched out in a few plainspoken lines. The seamless verse-chorus-verse transitions that mark ""Suitcase"", ""Dead Future"", and ""Kicking Puddles"", meanwhile, mark some of the band's most assured songwriting.</p>
<p>Standard Fare have gained some welcome horsepower, too: There's nothing ""ramshackle"" about the wildly zig-zagging bass line that darts through ""Bad Temper"", or the genuinely ripshit guitar solo that erupts two-thirds of the way through ""Suitcase"". The album is exuberant, neatly sequenced, and over in about half an hour: a modest joy, but great indie pop is an accumulation of modest joys. <i>Out of Sight, Out of Town</i> is, in fact, great indie pop: It's also the first encouraging sign of a career band hitting its stride.</p></div>"|16254.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16254-standard-fare-out-of-sight-out-of-town/|7.1|Jayson Greene

That was back in 2000, well before the internet had shifted into high gear; since then, the coming-out process has gotten only harder.</p>
<p>Barcelona's <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/johntalabot"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Talabot</a> and his first album, <i>ƒIN</i>, make for an interesting case study of the musical debutant: This is actually the artist's second time around. Under a different alias, as a resident DJ at one of Barcelona's techno institutions, he began his recording career in the mid 2000s, making punchy, melodic dance music with a clear debt to labels such as BPitch Control and Border Community. A few years later, around the same time that Barcelona's techno scene and the styles that fueled it began to go stale, his own productions began to shift. He eased into a mid-tempo chug and set aside buzzing synthesizers in favor of sun-bleached samples, trading neon fizz for dandelion fluff. Like a company de-listing itself from the stock market, the local fixture took himself private, assuming a new alias and wiping the slate clean.</p>
<p>It was a smart move. In the past two years, Talabot has become an exemplar of a new breed of producers working at the intersection of deep house, disco, and indie pop, and he has carved out his own niche somewhere between the slow-motion theatrics of artists such as Mark E and Tensnake, the globe-trotting jewel tones of Four Tet and Caribou, and the psych-pop rush of Animal Collective and Delorean. Having interviewed him a few times, I don't think there's a calculating bone in the-artist-currently-known-as-John-Talabot's body, but he has nevertheless benefited from being in the right place at the right time. His slow tempos, supersaturated colors, and tropical accents fit right in with the woozy, humid dance music that's currently in vogue, and he has found himself in esteemed company-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14661-shelter-john-talabots-feel-it-too-remix/"" target=""_blank"">remixing the xx</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12174-families-feat-glasser/"" target=""_blank"">recruiting Glasser's Cameron Mesirow for guest vocals</a>, and releasing on Young Turks. He's currently on tour in Australia with SBTRKT, another indicator that his star is on the rise.</p>
<p>Ironically, this all means that, his quasi-anonymity aside, Talabot finds himself growing up in public all over again as he graduates from singles and remixes to the full-length album form. Perhaps it's those raised stakes that make <i>ƒIN</i> feel like such a triumph. Across the album's 11 tracks, Talabot builds upon his distinctive sound-- bursting with color, nostalgic but never retro, easy-going yet slightly unhinged-- without repeating himself.</p>
<p>Talabot's early singles tended to follow a single trajectory, beginning with a bed of chunky percussion and then piling on loops of acoustic guitars, Philly strings, and soaring, pitched-up voices, usually culminating in a swollen, almost over-the-top climax. He hasn't entirely abandoned that approach, but he hasn't remained shackled to it, partly because he has shortened his track times considerably: Where his singles and remixes routinely ran seven, eight, even nine minutes, most of <i>ƒIN</i>'s tracks come in around the four-minute mark, giving him the opportunity to experiment with more modest ideas that say their piece and move on.</p>
<p>The album's first three songs show off his range. The opening ""Depak Ine""-- at seven-and-a-half minutes, it's the LP's longest cut-- is disco by way of Depeche Mode, with stabbing synths, eerie vocal samples, and an inexplicable chorus of croaking frogs. (The title resembles the brand name of a mood-stabilizing drug, which might explain the shift from minor to major halfway through; perhaps the frogs denote side effects?) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13082-destiny-ft-pional/"" target=""_blank"">""Destiny""</a>, a co-production with Madrid's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28614-pional/"" target=""_blank"">Pional</a>, is one of the album's obvious standouts, with beautifully harmonized vocals over lilting Caribbean chimes and a cozy, reassuring chord progression. Then, like a kind of palate cleanser, the three-minute ""El Oeste"" is a sleek little miniature of melting synthesizers, scraggly drum machines and dub delay that gradually swells into a folky, Boards of Canada-gone-house vibe.</p>
<p>A few times, Talabot tries to recreate the sensation that he nailed on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11409-sunshine/"" target=""_blank"">""Sunshine""</a>, an early hit that was as subtle as an ice-cream headache. With its stabbing chords and sped-up vocal loops, ""When the Past Was Present"" shows Talabot at his excessive best-- buzzing and slightly out of tune, with everything pushed into the red and teetering on the verge of collapse. ""Journeys"", the album's only misstep, goes for the same vibe, but there's something clunky about its construction, and the vocals, from Delorean's Ekhi Lopetegi, can be distractingly pitchy.</p>
<p>A kind of happy melancholy informs most of the album, but that unity of mood doesn't get in the way of the songs' potential to surprise. As many times as I listen, I keep discovering new sounds, phrases, and even entire songs that had previously passed me by, such as ""Estiu"", a demure, three-minute funk bumper that sounds like Dâm-Funk on Percoset, or ""Last Land"", whose breakbeat sounds based on the same sample used in Mr. Cheeks' 2001 club-rap hit <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3ewqjk64mU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lights, Camera, Action!""</a>.</p>
<p><i>ƒIN</i> saves its best song for last: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12950-so-will-be-now-ft-pional/"" target=""_blank"">""So Will Be Now...""</a>, another Pional co-production, which loops sampled vocals into a dreamy haze before digging into a sparse, deep-house groove. It's restrained, but there's real power there. A friend raved to me about how the song moved the dance floor at Berlin's Panorama Bar one Sunday morning. On your home speakers, it's as comforting as a lullaby, but played loud, apparently, those stark finger snaps and swooning coos are a call to collective ecstasy. Those contradictory qualities inform the whole record as it luxuriates in the space between private and public, just as its ambiguous title blurs the line between ends and means.</p></div>"|16249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16249-fin/|8.5|Philip Sherburne

Me, I don't necessarily give growling old white men the presumption of wisdom. Point being that even though <a href=""http://marklanegan.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mark Lanegan</a> will be all but grandfathered into that Hall of Fame in 20 years and will look swarthy in men's magazines proclaiming <i>Blues Funeral</i> to be the testosterone-boosting antidote to wimpy indie rock and fashionista hip-hop, he has every bit the obligation to avoid cliché and actually come up with good songs as everybody else. Can an album named <i>Blues Funeral</i>, of all things, actually make good on that?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's closer to something like <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985694/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Machete</a></i>, where the majority of the pleasure was derived from seeing grizzled and badass charcter actor Danny Trejo doing grizzled and badass things in a lead role, plot or character development be damned. But then again, <i>that voice</i>. It really is something to behold-- while the aforementioned greats have vocals that are nearly utilitarian in function, worn down to an essentialist nub, Lanegan's is as lustrous, supple, and thoroughly American as a well-oiled baseball mitt. When given the proper material-- which in the past has often come from wisely chosen collaborators such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/34088-lanegan-and-dulli-tour-but-not-as-the-gutter-twins/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Dulli</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/39053-isobel-campbell-and-mark-lanegan-team-up-for-new-album-hawk/"" target=""_blank"">Isobel Campbell</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44239-beck-josh-homme-mark-lanegan-remix-the-white-stripes-and-the-dead-weather/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Homme</a>, and PJ Harvey-- the results are almost invariably powerful on a sheer physical level. Do lyrics like, ""With piranha teeth/ I've been dreamin' of you,"" <i>sound</i> any less ridiculous than they look on paper? Not really, but it's the impossibly thick riffs and Jack Irons' feral drumming that drives ""The Gravedigger's Song"" toward Queens of the Stone Age's hot zone between the monster-truck muscle and race-car seduction.</p>
<p>Lanegan doesn't stay in there long. Based on title alone, it's tough to associate ""Bleeding Muddy Water"" with any word <i>besides</i> ""turgid,"" but the six minutes of the song itself, much of which finds Lanegan leaning hard on a line like ""loooooord, now the rain done come"" without creating context for its payoff, is more than content to follow suit, becoming one of <i>Blues Funeral</i>'s many dirges that simply drag. But even the more uptempo material is hamstrung by strangely dated production that makes it come off like one of those ""genre bending"" roots rock albums from 1999 that tried to incorporate electronica and hip-hop touches. As a result, <i>Blues Funeral</i> sounds adrift both sonically and lyrically, chippy drum machines and oozing synths backing Lanegan's verbal merry-go-round of rising suns, avenging gods, and pitiless oceans. Something like the crawling blooze of ""St. Louis Elegy"" should be hard as nails, and its chorus of, ""If tears were liquor/ I'd have drunk myself sick,"" tries to get there. But it's an exemplary Lanegan lyric in how repetition reveals its inherent clumsiness rather than depth. And while mentions of whisky are never too far away from descriptions of Lanegan's output, amidst the pumped-up kick drums and soloing guitars that <i>never stop once </i>during ""Riot in My House"", you feel like some retired NFL coach is about to give you a lecture on the significance of widemouth cans and frost brew liners.</p>
<p>Though a mixed bag, <i>Blues Funeral </i>does have its moments: ""Ode to Sad Disco"" is ostensibly the furthest stretch for Lanegan, a chintzy New Romantic backing that immediately recalls <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uttV1VZUgQQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Erasure's ""Chains of Love""</a> and flows easily where the similarly lengthy epics on <i>Blues Funeral </i>buckle under their own assumed weight. As a song, it's nothing amazing, but more important is the acknowledgement that it ""works."" Weirdly, the less overt the stunt casting, the more awkward it sounds: ""Harborview Hospital"" and ""Deep Black Vanishing Train"" have seemingly the most personal and poetic lyrics on <i>Blues Funeral, </i>but their dime-thin orchestral arrangements hew closer to Collective Soul's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPvQY9LMnZ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Run""</a> than resonance. And while ""Quiver Syndrome"" isn't too far away from the Brit Invasion bands that influenced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4122-screaming-trees/"" target=""_blank"">Screaming Trees</a>, it's the one time Lanegan is simply overwhelmed by the jet-setter production: Competing with disembodied female ""ooh-<i>oohs</i>"" and laser-light sound effects, Lanegan huffs, ""The moon don't smile on Saturday's child/ Lyin' still in Elysian fields/ I don't know what the doctor he did/ Now I'm all day long with my body in bed,"" like a winded Lizard King, proof that surrealistic nonsense can become its own kind of cliché.</p>
<p>Lanegan recently gave <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/07817-mark-lanegan-bakers-dozen?page=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview to the Quietus</a> where he namedropped albums by the Bee Gees, Kraftwerk, Joy Division, and the Gun Club as lifelong influences-- while it humanizes Lanegan in a way his obtuse and daunting lyrics rarely attempt to, it also makes you wish he went even further on <i>Blues Funeral</i>, so it could risk spectacular failure rather than mild disappointment. Indeed, <i>Blues Funeral </i>isn't ever <i>bad</i> per se, or even unlistenable. But back on Screaming Trees' 1996 album <i>Dust</i>, Lanegan sang, ""all along, I've been a traveler,"" and while he's done an often-admirable job of embodying that mission statement, the drifter isn't so compelling when they sound as directionless as he does here<i>.</i></p></div>"|16253.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16253-blues-funeral/|5.9|Ian Cohen

This is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV9MIQGgTEo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the 15th</a> they've released since 2004 through their own Pinkflag imprint, covering all three incarnations of the band: the brittle, brainy punks who hurtled artward from 1976 to 1980, the poppy, brainy ""beat-combo"" that branched out toward both alternative radio tunes and monomaniacal hammer-drone from 1985 to 1992, and the tough, brainy old guys who reconvened in 2000 and have been bearing down hard ever since. But the only really significant live Wire discs are the out-of-print <i>Document and Eyewitness</i>-- a bootleg-quality set centered on an abrasive 1980 gig that featured almost entirely new material-- and 1989's <i>It's Beginning to and Back Again</i>, which was so heavily reworked in the studio that it's barely a live album at all.</p>
<p>That shortlist hasn't changed with the new addition to the pile. The formal distinction of <i>The Black Session</i> is that it's the first recording to feature Wire's most recent stage lineup. (For those who haven't been following closely, founding guitarist Bruce Gilbert left in the mid-2000s; Margaret Fielder McGinnis of Laika replaced him on tour for a few years, and, since 2010, Matt Simms has augmented the remaining trio of original members on tour.)</p>
<p>The days when Wire would turn up for gigs with a set of material the audience had never heard before, or save the throwbacks for the encore, are behind them. At this gig, they run through the better part of 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14950-red-barked-tree/"" target=""_blank"">Red Barked Tree</a></i>, basically ignore everything else from the past 24 years except for 2002's hardcore-velocity ""Comet"", and toss in a couple of old favorites. It's particularly unsettling to hear <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ2RvSHK_B8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Map Ref. 41ºN 93ºW""</a>, one of their most precisely constructed studio singles, in a sloppy garage-band rendition-- metronomic drummer Robert Grey struggles to keep the tempo steady, and singer/guitarist Colin Newman sounds uncomfortably exposed when nobody joins him for harmonies on the chorus. The final encore is one that rejoined their repertoire in 2000 and stayed there: ""Pink Flag"", with its original two-chord structure replaced by a single blaring E chord at which they hammer for seven minutes or so until it disintegrates into end-of-show chaos.</p>
<p>For Wirephiles, the value of <i>The Black Session</i> is the live treatments of the <i>Red Barked Tree </i>tracks. As elegantly textured as that album was, it also sounded reserved and unconvinced in places, and tried to pass off some old Wire ideas as new ones. These versions have more fire and bite to them, even on slow numbers like ""Down to This"" and ""Adapt"", and the band has rearranged ""Clay"" to not sound <i>quite</i> so much like a faint carbon copy of 1978's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnIXXe83fe4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Am the Fly""</a>. There's no getting over the resemblance of ""Moreover"" to Wire's 1979 single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtjzuCSUTHk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Question of Degree""</a>, but it's mostly an excuse for them to stomp hard, and for Simms and Newman to contrast a tightly wound little riff with a high-pressure spray of noise.</p>
<p>In the context of Wire's catalog, this is just another document of incremental change, and not even the best live recording they've made lately (that would be their gorgeous <a href=""http://www.daytrotter.com/#!/concert/wire/20030350-8585"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daytrotter session</a> from 2008). Still, if this were the only Wire record in existence-- a debut album by a new quartet, three of them in their late 50s, captured live on French radio-- it'd be bracingly new even in 2012, an original take on punk minimalism, guitar sound, singing technique, tunefulness vs. dissonance, and so on. ""My God! They're so <i>gifted</i>!"" Newman yells in ""Two People in a Room"", and as usual he could be referring to himself and his collaborators.</p></div>"|16257.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16257-wire-the-black-session-paris-10-may-2011/|6.3|Douglas Wolk

It was easy to assume after the fact that if Brian Lindgren focused on just one of his strengths-- Americanized French touch, fat-bottomed analog hip-hop, gauzy-yet-speaker-rattling downtempo ambient-- he could produce the next phase of a defining sound with real mutation potential. <i>Planet High School</i> narrows his scope and draws a more specific target, streamlining those aforementioned touchstones into a blend of synthesized airiness and thick bass that sounds a bit like g-funk for planetariums. But as with his best tracks, the common thread that runs through each song is a sense of restless metamorphosis, the sense that there's no use wearing out a good loop when there's plenty of space to throw it around.</p>
<p>There's a confident immediacy to the beats that initially drive them-- whether agitatedly hopped-up (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12867-raw-gore/"" target=""_blank"">""Raw Gore""</a>, ""Cash for Gold"") or floating at cruising speed (""Ruin Everything"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12618-palace-chalice/"" target=""_blank"">""Palace Chalice""</a>)-- and Lindgren gives himself the space to jostle and upend their structures in freewheeling ways. There are so many rhythmic and melodic layers to each track that he often produces attention-getting dynamics just by fiddling with one of the elements, dropping in or pulling out a bassline's notes to shift momentum without losing tempo, or pushing a deceptively simple drum break into supple polyrhythms. It's not just about waiting for big drops or build-build-build-release catharsis; it's about constructing a track that ricochets inside itself, splits, regroups, and counteracts itself several times in just a few bars without once losing grasp of its own forward movement. It's undeniably danceable, but the pop-and-lock routines you could set to this might tear ACLs.</p>
<p>It's when Lindgren tries to accelerate too far into frenetic overload that things start shaking apart. There are only three cuts of 10 that let the works go spiraling uncontrolled into the grandstands, but they're pretty confounding, trading off manic glitchiness and bewildering juxtapositions that upend what could have been a more naturalistic flow. ""Get Yer Alphabets (Guns)"" is the grimiest, threatening bro-step wobbles and hiccup-spasm snares before settling on a warbly Squarepusher-ish bassline that doesn't quite lend itself to nuanced manipulation-- so it gets Benihana'd into an Adderall freakout instead. ""Live at 7-11"" sabotages its hypnotic, swooning funk halfway through for a series of drum'n'bass crescendos that border on non-sequitur, then peters into a woozy, tacked-on codeine keyboard coda. And ""The Butterfly Technique"" tries to do for lo-fi samples what the other tracks did for thick analog sounds, but if you can get past the stuck-doorbell intro and a frantic, piano-driven attempt to grasp on to some semblance of groove, you're still dealing with a pile-up of sounds that don't quite mesh. So maybe Mux Mool can't literally do everything-- but for the bulk of <i>Planet High School</i>, he's got himself an engaging something.</p></div>"|16242.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16242-mux-mool-planet-high-school/|6.7|Nate Patrin

The time when Imperial Teen's music could have been considered sellable to America's radio suits, that late-1990s moment when alt-rock shrugged off grunge gloom for gloss and smiles, feels like it happened in another lifetime. As for all of the sounds that have come and gone in indie-land since-- from garage-rock revival to dance-punk to whatever the hell we're calling chillwave in the post-mortem period-- they might as well not have happened in Imperial Teen's world.</p>
<p>This dogged insularity in the face of indie's endless trend-hopping is essentially a good thing, even if you have to be down with Imperial Teen's basic routine of slick and déjà vu inducing power-pop hooks, oveer-sugared harmonies, and immediately sing-alongable choruses to need more than one record. And ""routine"" is the right word here, even if I don't mean it as an insult. Following the band's relaxed, ""let's put out an album every four or five years for fun"" release schedule, the new <i>Feel the Sound</i> is sunny and bubbly, but the bulk of these songs follow a very specific template with the rigor of any furrow-browed academic composer.</p>
<p>A steady bubblegum beat, somewhere between ABBA in motorik mode and the Archies-go-C86, sets things up. Soft vocals, sometimes harmonizing in time-honored indie pop tradition and sometimes solo, carry us through a low-key verse. Then comes the explosive, joyful chorus. Repeat a handful of times, and we're out. <i>Feel the Sound</i> does its best to keep things varied by once again stretching beyond the stripped-down DIY guitar jangle of vintage indie pop. Imperial Teen haven't lost their knack for shining up these simple and familiar forms with careful (but not suffocating) ornamentation. And true, things get a little darker in the album's middle stretch. But since this is Imperial Teen, we're talking a rather gentle and non-threatening brand of darkness. ""Over His Head"" had me imagining a world where Sarah Cracknell joined a Cure tribute band rather than Saint Etienne, their lone single winding up on a K-Tel compilation of moody goth-pop classics, and ""Hanging About"" catches a similar vibe, where pensive post-punk takes the proverbial chill pill.</p>
<p>For the most part, though, from robotic-but-rambunctious opener ""Runaway"" to the late-album one-two closing swoon of ""It's You"" and ""Overtaken"", <i>Feel the Sound</i> leans on Imperial Teen's puppyish charm and love for soft-rock's smooth bliss. The rock songs are revved-up but not macho. The ballads are written by folks who've studied the songs of 1960s and 1970s greats rather than smearing a bunch of feedback over some weedy purloined hooks. And yet, despite their tendency toward pop formalism, Imperial Teen are hardly the Ramones, and <i>Feel the Sound</i>'s got plenty of variety even within its own rather strict songwriting guidelines. It's not going to <i>surprise</i> anyone, least of all longtime fans, but it's not like there are dozens of similar acts around at the moment demanding your attention. And indie pop's current lesser lights usually lack for Imperial Teen's care and craft, two aspects not to be knocked when dealing with the restrictions of the old verse-chorus-verse.

Or, at least, they haven't been for quite some time: Since 2004's breakthrough sixth full-length, <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5954-satanic-panic-in-the-attic/"" target=""_blank"">Satanic Panic in the Attic</a></i>, Kevin Barnes has largely written, recorded, and performed every album on his own, occasionally calling on outside collaborators (<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/38779-listen-to-janelle-monaes-song-with-of-montreal-make-the-bus/"" target=""_blank"">Janelle Monaé</a>, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/39596-watch-of-montreal-and-solange-perform-sex-karma-on-jimmy-fallon/"" target=""_blank"">Solange Knowles</a>, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12600-jon-brion-remix-ep-synecdoche-new-york-ost/"" target=""_blank"">Jon Brion</a>) to add flourishes. He made the decision to shift toward creative solitude nearly eight years into a career that has now spanned 16, and the decision made sense. Since <i>Satanic Panic</i>, Barnes has treated the LP form as a highly personal forum exploration, a place to indulge his every whim without regard for his audience.</p>
<p>In that sense, of Montreal's latest, <i>Paralytic Stalks</i>, is more of the same: Barnes recorded it in his own Sunlandic Studios with the assistance of strings arranger/performer Kishi Bashi and a smattering of session musicians, and has stated that the album is meant to be taken whole. But even for a songwriter as sonically adventurous as Barnes, something feels different this time around. He's always been fond of concepts (2008's alter-ego-happy <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12328-skeletal-lamping/"" target=""_blank"">Skeletal Lamping</a>, </i>the funk freakouts of 2010's <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14640-false-priest/"" target=""_blank"">False Priest</a></i>), but on <i>Paralytic Stalks</i>, he sounds completely adrift, as if his thousand-synapses-firing-all-at-once approach finally blew a massive fuse.</p>
<p>When I <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/43989-of-montreals-kevin-barnes-talks-new-album-cassette-box-set-his-career/"" target=""_blank"">spoke with Barnes</a> this past fall about the influences driving the creation of <i>Paralytic Stalks</i>, he cited difficult 20th-century composers such as Charles Ives and Krzysztof Penderecki, predicting it'd be a hard sell for most listeners before doubling back and referring to it as a ""colorful pop record."" The truth lies somewhere in the middle. It is, without a doubt, his most fragmented album since the tail end of the project's Elephant 6 days, which is saying a lot considering the tiny stitched-together segments made <i>Skeletal Lamping</i> such a challenging, divisive album. To me, that record sounded like a pleasurably jumbled mess of endless possibilities; <i>Paralytic Stalks</i> just sounds like a mess.</p>
<p>The seam in <i>Paralytic Stalks</i>' patchwork comes at the midpoint of ""Ye, Renew the Plaintiff"", which delineates the album's two halves. The front half plays to strengths Barnes' has honed over the last eight years-- stuffed production on the brink of exploding, melodies that constantly change direction, and unhinged vocal performances. The hooks just aren't there, though, and that's a big problem, considering that even Barnes' most esoteric records have had their share of memorable take-aways (<i>Skeletal Lamping</i>'s ""An Eluardian Instance"", <i>False Priest</i>'s ""Our Riotous Defects""). With the possible exception of ""Malefic Dowery"", which is surprisingly lush, little here sticks.</p>
<p>The ""20th-century classical music"" influence comes during the album's second half: Its songs run longer, and they're packed with dissonant drones, screeching noise, and, in the case of ""Exorcismic Breeding Knife"", a surging orchestral cacophony. It's challenging stuff, a distant cousin to the kind of abstractions that Barnes flirted with on last year's <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15360-thecontrollersphere-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>thecontrollersphere</i> EP</a>. Barnes doesn't go all-in, but rather, pastes bits of psychedelia, stuttering synth-funk, and hushed piano balladry on the ends of ""Wintered Debts"" and ""Authentic Pyrrhic Remission"", which all feels utterly wasted given the shapeless and indistinct surroundings.</p>
<p>The most disappointing aspect of <i>Paralytic Stalks</i> is that lack of personality behind the music. Barnes has treated songwriting as a personal therapy session, and the recording studio as a psychologist's couch under mirrored ceilings. On 2007's brilliant <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/43989-of-montreals-kevin-barnes-talks-new-album-cassette-box-set-his-career/"" target=""_blank"">Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?</a></i>, he faced off with his super-ego amidst infidelity, depression, and self-destruction; the following year's <i>Skeletal Lamping</i> contained so much <i>him</i> that he needed an alter-ego, the glammy sexpot Georgie Fruit, to get it all out there.</p>
<p>The words ""personal"" and ""dark"" have been referenced in <i>Paralytic</i>'s promotional lead-up, but without a lyric sheet, it's nearly impossible to tell that Barnes is singing about <i>anything</i>, save for the surprisingly straightforward ""Malefic Dowery"", which goes back to the the subject of infidelity. I don't doubt that this is a personal album for Barnes, but on <i>Hissing Fauna</i>, that was obvious-- all you had to do was <i>listen</i>. Here, we're left sorting through lyrics like, ""True love never mattered/ The two donkey jaws that were removed from our hearing.""</p>
<p>It's hard to blame Barnes for being tired. Since the project's 1997 debut, <i>Cherry Peel</i>, of Montreal haven't gone a year without issuing some sort of new material. By now, he's akin to a Steven Soderbergh, an artist so driven to follow his muse that, even in the face of exhaustion, the thought of retirement only spurs him to work <i>more</i>. The thoroughly unenjoyable <i>Paralytic Stalks</i> might be a sign that Barnes should take some time off and let the inspiration come to him.</p></div>"|16250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16250-paralytic-stalks/|4.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

As a song, ""So Far Away"" carried a lot of the same hallmarks of the material that had immediately preceded it, but unlike the screeching, industrial-minded manic power that defined much of their terrifically visceral <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10595-a-place-to-bury-strangers/?utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=related-content&amp;utm_name=albumreviews"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>, it's a groomed, economic kind of song that rounds-off all of the dangerous, splintered ends. More notable was <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/video-premiere-place-bury-strangers-hipstamatic-shot-so-far-away"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the video</a> that accompanied the track, a sort of ""flipbook"" montage of frontman Oliver Ackermann's own personal <a href=""http://hipstamatic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hipstamatic</a> photos, stitched together to create a stop-motion-animation effect, except with real live people and settings. Like rifling through the iPhone of a very busy and well-traveled guy, it's actually a unique, voyeuristic peek into the progression of a person's year, complete with amorous cavorting, gigging, and passenger-side window boredom, all set in some pretty stunning locales. But it should be said that, aside from containing plenty of APTBS-related snaps thrown in the mix, it's not a video that feels terribly representative of Ackermann's band. After a half-decade, A Place to Bury Strangers aren't an act that's allowed their music to do much moving around, and when they have, they've let moodier tendencies prevail. In other words, if the ""Stay Away"" video had solely been a document of APTBS's progression, it wouldn't have been nearly as engaging.</p>
<p><i>Onward to the Wall</i> opens with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0bUsoP9XZ8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Lost You""</a>, and while it remains firmly in the band's wheelhouse, it feels indicative of the APTBS that lives in the mind: A pummeling onslaught of of banshee-wail guitar stacked on top of a chugging motorik bass riff, plus some gnarly, rancid feedback. In essence, it's a no-prisoners take that, while nothing new, is welcomingly jarring. It is by far the best of the five tracks offered here, a return-to-form that seems to take the more calculated moves on <i>Exploding Head</i> and re-routes them back in the right direction. Unfortunately, the rest of <i>Onward to the Wall</i> takes even fewer chances than <i>Exploding Head</i> did. The reality begins to set in that, try as they might, this is a band resigned to making ""mature"" post-punk tunes instead of tapping into its live-wire essence. Because when the title track shares more in common with an old <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7843-she-wants-revenge/"" target=""_blank"">She Wants Revenge</a> cut than the slow-lane <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27600-dum-dum-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Dum Dum Girls</a> cut it secretly wants to be, well, we got a problem. In essence, if there's anything to be learned from this EP, it's that the majority of APTBS's career can be chalked up to playing it safe. Which, for a lot of us, is wildly disheartening.</p>
<p>It isn't to say there aren't some great little moments tucked in here and there. ""Nothing Will Surprise Me"" brings in bracing cat-in-heat guitar moans over a hardcore backbeat, plus there's the aforementioned ""I Lost You"". But it means we're left with three other tracks that are characterless at best. I've never been too big a fan of Ackermann's goth-y, dead-eyed delivery, but it seems here as if the music is using his vocals as something of a guiding light. It amounts to a mostly homogenous, toothless EP that seems to be aiming for a greater appeal, but ends up appealing very little.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most problematic thing about <i>Onward to the Wall</i> is its timing. As the profile of New York City bands making dangerous, abrasive, and loud music becomes increasingly elevated, you can't help but yearn for the APTBS of five years ago. It would've been great to see them help supplement a bill along with the ranks of pig-fuck revivalists, black metal revisionists, and nü-noiseniks. Here, they sound disconnected from what made them so visceral and captivating in the first place, as if they're almost scared to go back. Instead, they've resigned to making more color-by-numbers post punk that uses too many grays and not enough pure blacks, and as time goes on, it feels as if their paint brush water is being incrementally diluted by half.</p></div>"|16244.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16244-a-place-to-bury-strangers-onward-to-the-wall/|5.8|Zach Kelly

Those comparisons won't be going away anytime soon for Cambridge, UK singer-songwriter <a href=""http://www.thedoozer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Doozer</a>, though he's abandoned his solo setup and recorded <i>Keep it Together</i> with 11 other musicians. The style of his fourth album is actually far removed from Knox and Barrett. In its grab-bag-orchestra instrumentation and library-quiet charm, the Doozer's songs are more in the realm of Glaswegian twee. Considering the experimental, homespun vibe of the three albums that came before it, <i>Keep it Together</i>'s colorful arrangements give it the kind of vibrancy and pop-friendliness his past work was lacking.</p>
<p>Opener ""Burning Bright"" shows the newly assembled band putting its best foot forward. Leaning on a sturdy vocal melody, the track goes a long way on a simple chord progression, scattered lyrics suggesting new beginnings, and a buoyant string section. On <i>Keep it Together</i> as a whole, the instruments come together surprisingly well for an artist normally used to a vastly more minimal setup. The songs are often lush and ornate, and for any lover of unconventional instrumentation, there are a few genuine surprises. (Sitar! A tuba reportedly bought from the Salvation Army!) Once the novelty of the added bells and whistles wears off, however, all you have is a pretty-but-boring pop album.</p>
<p>Aside from ""Burning Bright"" and ballad <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1795-the-island/"" target=""_blank"">""The Island""</a><span>, the other songs barely deviate from the same plodding tempo, making the album's 41 minutes seemingly last hours longer. There's rarely a surge in energy or even a mild outburst: The guitars are strummed politely, and the drums are played with brushes. Even the aforementioned tuba loses its luster about halfway through ""Jobsworth"". In graduating from a cast of one to a cast of a dozen, the Doozer not only jettisoned the more challenging aspects of his past albums, he also got rid of what made them interesting.</span></p>
<p>This could be forgiven if he were a more compelling songwriter, but the added to clarity has made his lyrics unbearable to listen to. In trying to sound a little more poignant than your average songwriter with nothing to say, <i>Keep it Together</i> has choruses built on dull motivation (<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12848-fold-up-chair/"" target=""_blank"">""Fold Up Chair""</a>), simple math (""The Island""), and elementary-school ecology (""Lowest Point""). Half-baked imagery peppers each of its songs: A man carrying a milk jug, a rabbit scurrying around a hutch. Even if finding poignancy in the mundane was the Doozer's task, there are no remarks on why the characters in his songs do what they do; they just do them and are off to the next part of their incredibly average day.</p>
<p>There's a sense of mystery that surrounds the Doozer. Because there's almost no information about his personal life, all we have to go on is his pseudonym and the music he's released. Considering the intrigue of his past work, <i>Keep it Together</i> makes a good case for why certain people choose to lead enigmatic lifestyles: Sometimes there's very little going on underneath the surface.</p></div>"|16245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16245-keep-it-together/|5.8|Martin Douglas

When I <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/8718-closing-the-books/2/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">asked him</a> last year if he found any connections between those pursuits, he recalled testing a virtual-reality machine that simulates schizophrenic hallucinations. To Swanson, the bombardment of illogical stimuli felt ""psychedelic in the most terrible way""-- and similar to his music. ""There are these elements that [are] very concrete and consistent and musical, and people can latch onto these things,"" he said. ""But then there are all these other things happening-- distortions being introduced, [and] chaotic elements that don't contribute musically, but determine the trajectory of the piece.""</p>
<p>That description certainly fits <i>Man With Potential</i>, perhaps more than any other record he's been involved with. The handful of cassettes and LPs he has <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Pete+Swanson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">released</a> since Yellow Swans disbanded in 2008 have had their share of distortion and chaos. But none has offered something this easy to latch onto. It comes in the form of a consistent, prominent beat-- so prominent that some claim Swanson has ""gone techno."" This isn't completely new territory for him, though-- Yellow Swans could drop a heavy beat too, especially on their throbbing 2004 album <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8909-bring-the-neon-war-home/"">Bring the Neon War Home</a></i>.</p>
<p>But even that blast of nuclear dance-noise didn't have the insistence and drive of <i>Man With Potential</i>. On most of the tracks, this drive is like a caffeine-infused heartbeat, pumping blood into a mix of buzzing tones, rising waves, and cutting noise. Swanson is usually partial to drones, but here his approach is more precise and almost pointillist, often sounding like a symphony of dot-matrix printers. Swarms of chirps, whirrs, blips, and pops dart and dive around each other, but they're all grounded by a relentless, nerve-affecting pulse.</p>
<p>Those words may make <i>Man With Potential </i>seem hyper and frenzied, a blizzard of blinding sound. At times it does feel that way. <a href=""http://vimeo.com/32264498"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Misery Beat""</a> opens the album in the midst of panic, pounding and squeaking like Swanson has been sprinting for hours and we're just catching up. But the beat also has a calming effect. It stabilizes what might otherwise be dizzying, like a sedative that makes chaos feel less frightening. It might sound paradoxical, but there really is a meditative aspect to Swanson's flying noise. That's not surprising given his history of infusing all kinds of sounds with Zen-like serenity.</p>
<p>In fact, as fun and oddly danceable as these tracks<i> </i>can be, the best are the most rhythmically serene. They're also the noisiest-- the granular grit of ""A&amp;Ox0"" swells into soothing waves, while closer ""Face the Music"" is the album's only slow track, as bass lines rise into something like abstract metal or hardcore New Age. All those adjectives may be a lot to swallow, but on <i>Man With Potential </i>Pete Swanson's ability to encompass many sounds and moods knows few bounds, if any.</p></div>"|16247.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16247-man-with-potential/|8.5|Marc Masters

Perhaps that's why the duo moved to Brooklyn ahead of the release of its second full-length, <i>Better Luck Next Life</i>, an album gloomy almost to the point of self-parody. It's nine songs about black souls, black hearts, S&amp;M, and dark lords pounded out over Bo Diddley beats. They don't skimp on the details, either. For Royal Baths, there is no question: The world is a vampire.</p>
<p>In the past, Royal Baths' music has been tagged as psychedelic if only because of their geographic proximity to groups like <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/28104-the-fresh-onlys/"" target=""_blank"">the Fresh &amp; Onlys</a>, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"" target=""_blank"">Thee Oh Sees</a>, and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"" target=""_blank"">Ty Segall</a>. But this latest set of songs yields little in the way of incense and peppermints. It's a sludgy, turgid take on the blues, swiping it's chief inspiration from the Velvet Underground but supplementing heavily with sounds from mid-1980s goth rockers like the Gun Club and the Bad Seeds. Each song is a handful of grotty chords strummed on a guitar with every string tuned to the same note.</p>
<p>Royal Baths' debut LP, <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14843-litanies/"" target=""_blank"">Litanies</a></i>, was cobbled together in the band's practice space on a Tascam 388, the Bay Area's leading choice for fuzz-tinged DIY-recording. The grotty production imbued their songs-- which were bleak and droney, but eerily twee and melodic-- with an extra edge. This time around, some of the grit is gone. So are the Aleister Crowley-meets-Beat Happening hooks. Whatever pop pretenses Royal Baths harbored, they've mostly let them slide, ditching verse-chorus-verse for static Diddley rhythm tracks that buoy Jigmae Baer's seedy monologues.</p>
<p>For a record that concerns itself so heavily with evil, though, <i>Better Luck Next Life </i>is fairly subdued. Baer delivers his lyrics in a reedy, muted tenor that wobbles in and out of key. It's an intentional effect, meant to enhance the music's creep factor by delivering darkness in a disaffected voice, but the blasé attitude makes it harder to buy in.</p>
<p>The ecstatic call-and-response aspect of the blues is mostly missing. On ""Burned"", Baer allots himself several minutes to trance out and unwind into the music while Cox pummels his guitar. But most of the songs are just short stories recited over droney chords. And the prose gets a little purple: ""Bloody landscapes are my daydreams, bodies fall/ If I could touch the hem of Satan I would crawl,"" sings Baer on ""Black Sheep"".</p>
<p>But you can't quibble with Royal Baths' sincerity. They look the part, for sure. Dressed in shredded paisley hand-me-downs, guitarist Jeremy Cox resembles a zombie-makeup version of Jefferson Airplane's Marty Balin. Their tour ride is a Chevy Suburban spraypainted matte black. They're an iffy live band, but on stage they project their weirder impulses well-- pummeling the audience with feedback, barely hewing to the structures of their songs. On good nights, the band conjures a singularly eerie vibe. But on <i>Better Luck Next Life</i>, it's not always coming through.</p></div>"|16251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16251-royal-baths-better-luck-next-life/|6.4|Aaron Leitko

The surface-beautiful <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15566-electronic-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Electronic Dream</a></i>, for example, introduced him to a wider audience in part because it veered from the tougher-sounding beats Araab makes for rappers. But it still made sense next to what came before, offering up an entrancing, self-contained sound that grabbed at dance club roots but darkened and abstracted its samples to suggest something private and intimate. And he has a serious live reputation, with a unique approach to performance. AraabMuzik is a virtuoso percussionist whose instrument just happens to be an MPC pad, and longtime Dipset fans and fashionable interlopers alike elbow one another for space around his table, collectively freaking out over the physical spectacle. He's also booked for a Coachella slot this year, and says he's planning to release a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45027-aap-rocky-araabmuzik-team-up-for-avpmuzik-project/"" target=""_blank"">collaborative project</a> with equally doted-upon Harlem rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a>. You'd be hard-pressed to find a producer with as much reach as a solo commodity as Araab right now. He's having a moment.</p>
<p>Given all of that, the timing of <i>Instrumental University </i>feels off. It's a serviceable sampler of harder-knocking beats cleaved off largely unmemorable recent releases from some of his most trusted collaborators-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10940-lloyd-banks/"" target=""_blank"">Lloyd Banks</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7480-fabolous/"" target=""_blank"">Fabolous</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6653-jim-jones/"" target=""_blank"">Jim Jones</a> and, of course, Dipset pals <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/937-camron/"" target=""_blank"">Cam'ron</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29282-vado/"" target=""_blank"">Vado</a>, among others. And while it's perfectly natural for a producer in AraabMuzik's position to make a beat tape-- it's a time-honored rap tradition, after all, and he's indulged before-- it's not something that fits the arc of his current upswing.</p>
<p>As the cover implies, this is a release presumably aimed at beat nerds and aspiring rappers looking for tracks. That's disappointing if you're still high on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>'s re-imagining of what this sort of thing can be-- his thick and stoned <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15292-instrumental-mixtape/"" target=""_blank"">Instrumental Mixtape</a></i> from last spring reinvigorated the idea of the producer as auteur instead of background figure. But <i>Instrumental University</i> sticks to a more traditional script. Given the fact that he's charging money for these tracks (many of which first appeared on free mixtapes), and peppering them with his increasingly annoying drop, ""You are now listening to AraabMuzik,"" <i>Instrumental University</i> might seem like a self-congratulatory stopgap if the beats weren't so consistently expert and sleek.</p>
<p>He moves from the horror-film piano chords and signature echoey screams of ""1, 2, 3 Grind"" to the soul-sampling, nearly Dipset-classic vibe of ""Ain't Mad Acha"". The same sensibility is obviously behind it, but these tracks are built from a very different foundation than those found on billowy <i>Electronic Dream.</i> And because there are no beats taken from real <i>hit</i>-hits here (the instrumental from ""Salute"" and the unrelenting chipmunky smack of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45099-araabmuzik-readies-new-beats-comp/"" target=""_blank"">""Rubberband Stacks""</a> are the closest we get), Araab avoids that unsatisfied lurch of anticipation for a familiar verse that never drops. In fact, there's a strong inverse relationship between the listenability of the instrumentals and the strength of the tracks with verses.</p>
<p>So this is background music, sure, a workmanlike collection of beats that oscillates within a narrow but extremely proficient range of sound. Still, even for its failings as a proper album, <i>Instrumental University </i>is still quintessential Araab, constantly walking the razor-sharp line between glimmery and ominous. At this point, he's still known first and foremost as someone who can pound the living daylight out of a set of MPC pads. But we're again reminded that his identity also rests in his distinctive ear for uneasy mood, a quality subtle and delicate and not tied to any one technique.</p></div>"|16246.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16246-instrumental-university/|6.4|Carrie Battan

It encompasses acts like Miracles Club, Ital, and their 100% Silk labelmates, as well as like minds from the more established Italians Do It Better and DFA (Matmos member and Pitchfork contributor Drew Daniel rightly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16108-throbbing-gristle/"">traces the approach's roots all the way back to Throbbing Gristle</a>). The common thread is live electronic instrumentation and lo-fi recording <i>as aesthetic choice</i> (surely, these acts could just as easily afford to drop Ableton onto their laptops as buy rhythm boxes). The approach may recall house's 808 roots, but implicit in that troublesome ""hipster"" is the idea that these rock kids aren't taking dance music seriously or playing by its rules-- that they're treating it with the irony typically ascribed to the 2000s' favorite strawman. All of which makes Brooklyn duo <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/blondeblondeblondes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blondes</a> both an archetypal hipster house act and a rewarding example of the tag's limitations.</p>
<p>Archetypal because the duo of Zach Steinman and Sam Haar improvises on live instruments, records tracks in single takes rather than endlessly re-tooling them in software, and generally approaches making house tracks with an outsider's disregard for convention. The pair met while studying music and studio art at Oberlin College, which also birthed nü-disco producer Morgan Geist, amongst other acts, and they bring both learned musicianship and a collegiate friendliness toward jamming to bear on their self-titled full-length debut.</p>
<p>Their songs begin with an idea or two-- a beat, an effect, a bassline, or synth phrase-- and gradually accrete more layers, steadily drifting toward a sustained climax before fading out piece by piece. It's the meandering feel of a jam locked into a linear structure: tracks that privilege house's hypnotic repetitions over its cathartic patterns of build-and-release. Blondes' formal transparency-- the way you can see each element as its being added-- makes it easy to imagine them playing these songs live, but they handily avoid the lo-fi ""live PA"" quality that makes some of their putative peers less than suitable for club sound systems and dance floors.</p>
<p><i>Blondes</i> collects three previously released 12""'s and a pair of new songs, each arranged as oppositional A- and B-sides: ""Lover""/""Hater"", ""Business""/""Pleasure"", ""Water""/""Wine"", and ""Gold""/""Amber"". These flipsides aren't exactly dub versions of their related tracks, but they are frequently more subdued reflections-- the bright synth arpeggios and displaced voices on the A-sides submerged into deep house bass thump or ambient atmospherics on their reverse.</p>
<p>A second disc of remixes generally pulls the tracks even further towards their polar extremes, with typically mixed results. Optimo's JD Twitch ratchets up the tribal thump of ""Lover"", while Dungeon Acid remake it as a sweat-dripping subterranean epic at 11 minutes. Andy Stott's ""Pleasure"" becomes a muffled deep house throb, while Teengirl Fantasy's remix of ""Wine"" ups the lush synth pads and adds some piano tinkling, and Bicep's remix of ""Water"" adds a pneumatic jacking beat and echoing diva vocals. Laurel Halo and Rene Hell respectively make ""Gold"" and ""Amber"" into gaseous ambient and an elegiac organ variation. At worst, the remixes are fine but superfluous for all but the specialty DJ or completist; the highlights above make at turns interesting, useful, and simply pleasurable revisions.</p>
<p>Early reviews situated Blondes as better headphone listening than dance-floor filler, and while their releases prior to these 12""'s were more downtempo, this also points to the fact that their songs are simply well produced, as pleasurable on a pure sonic level as they are practical. Despite retaining a relaxed, lightly psychedelic feel, <i>Blondes</i>' songs are properly functionalist grooves. They may lack the rise-and-fall amplitude of traditional house, but on what everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/techno/6178-the-month-in-techno/"">Philip Sherburne</a> to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15226-horizontal-structures/"">Moritz Von Oswald Trio</a> have recognized as electronic music's ""horizontal"" axis, they succeed admirably.

Their song <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11192-strangling-good-guys/"" target=""_blank"">""Strangling Good Guys""</a> stood out with its satisfyingly distorted drums and haze of lusty shoegaze pop. It was a cut that sounded fresh, powerful, and ended up feeling ahead of a curve that gave us the similarly fuzzy pop of the first Best Coast, Pearl Harbor, and Smith Westerns demos.</p>
<p>A couple of singles and a long delay later, the band finally arrives at its debut record, <i>Ester</i>. While it's not a bad record, it ranks as a disappointment. The re-recorded version of ""Strangling Good Guys"" acts as a handy capsule to illustrate its problems: The blown-out drums of before are now neutered and low in the mix, and the toothy shattered-glass guitars are muzzled by newly flat production. It sounds like a song recorded by committee and subject to endless revisions, each new take diluting the original's potency. The delight of the demo version was that it felt like it existed on instinct and gut feeling, whereas this just sounds over-thought and dull.</p>
<p>There's a minute of a great song in ""Dies in 55"", but that also falls apart beneath cluttered, confused elements. We're treated to awkward drum rolls, non sequitur bass drops, and a bassline that might well be offbeat, though in such a rhythmless environment it's difficult to tell. <span> </span>There's nothing solid to glue these stuttering ideas together, and what started brightly quickly becomes a mess.</p>
<p>Trailer Trash Tracys sound much better when they mine simple patterns. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12477-wish-you-were-red-engelhardts-arizona/"" target=""_blank"">""You Wish You Were Red""</a> is carried by a basic beat, nonchalant guitar, and a sparse bass pattern. The economy of ideas means that each good one has space to really work. The restraint lends the song an airy glow and also allows Susanne Aztoria's honeyed vocals to come to the fore.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11521-candy-girl/"" target=""_blank"">""Candy Girl""</a> is another high point. The song first emerged a couple of years ago and, unlike ""Strangling Good Guys"", sounds as good as ever. The booming electronic drums and dirty, crackling guitar still carry a feeling of effortless cool as Aztoria's vocal swoops and dives. Her impressive knack for a tune is the band's big strength, and it's a shame that too often those melodies are squeezed or thrown off course by unnecessary parts.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12477-wish-you-were-red-engelhardts-arizona/"" target=""_blank"">""Engelhardt's Arizona""</a> is a perfect example of this. Aztoria's yearning vocal fizzes with intrigue, sounding a bit like Nina Persson of the Cardigans, but it's almost impossible to pick out any nuance beneath a maddening guitar part that feels like the product of somebody who just learned hammer-on techniques and wanted to show them off.</p>
<p>That the 30-odd minutes of <i>Ester</i> took so long to finalize makes for a slightly baffling proposition, given that its two best moments sound so casually off-the-cuff and effortless. <span> </span>At this point it's hard not to feel like the Trailer Trash Tracys who sounded pretty vital in 2009 have been left behind by a whole slew of bands that followed their starting gun and reached the finishing line quicker, and better.</p></div>"|16239.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16239-trailer-trash-tracys-ester/|5.5|Hari Ashurst

I do not like change!"" When Tobin Prinz hollered those lines on <a href=""http://www.prinzhorn-dance-school.com/prinzhorn/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prinzhorn Dance School</a>'s 2007 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10601-prinzhorn-dance-school/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>, he was speaking in the crotchety voice of an uptight conservative caricature. But, judging by this five-years-in-the-waiting follow-up, the line serves as a handy bumper-sticker advertisement for his own band's cryogenically sealed post-punk aesthetic.</p>
<p>If Gang of Four famously extracted the sex out of funk, then Prinzhorn Dance School suck the funk out of Gang of Four, retaining their violent guitar spasms, ominous bass throbs, derisive vocal interplay, and the claustrophobic, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sNfbprnKU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Entertainment!</i>-style production</a>, but breaking up the 4/4 fluidity into hiccupping, epileptic rhythms that, true to the PDS name, would seemingly require some educational instruction on how to dance to them. Where most bands reemerge from an extended absence exhibiting changed perspectives and freshly absorbed new influence, Prinzhorn Dance School remain defiantly un-evolved. No string sections, dubstep makeovers, or, hell, even a single cheery synthesizer line for these two; the challenge of telling the two albums apart could form the basis of a great dorm-room drinking game. But then, as that first record made clear, Prinzhorn Dance School's proudly spartan setup is simply a reflection of the harsh, unforgiving, hand-to-mouth nature of modern English life-- and it's not as if an interim economic collapse has made the situation any more promising.</p>
<p>And so <i>Clay Class</i> presents familiarly despairing scenes of ""granite-gray"" skies and ""concrete hinterlands,"" while the band's instrumental economy extends to the songwriting, which can quantify the magnitude of the global recession in a single dispiriting couplet (""Got off the treadmill, treadmill/ Got in the breadline, breadline"") or disarmingly evocative image (""A tin of mixed fruit/ On special occasions""). As co-vocalists, Prinz and partner Suzi Horn rarely play off one another, or try to assert their individual identities; rather, their disparate voices-- a withering, monotone sing-speak for him, hyperactive yelps for her-- simply deliver the same dispiriting news with different degrees of anxiety.</p>
<p>In the absence of any marked sonic or thematic progression, <i>Clay Class</i> at least captures the duo's growth as song arrangers, as they utilize their limited tools to greater dramatic effect. Where the songs on PDS' debut tended to stop once the duo ran out of things to say, <i>Clay Class</i> harnesses the band's repetitive bassline riffs and stuttering drum breaks to subtly ramp up the intensity (as on the extended shout-it-out chorus of ""Your Fire Has Gone Out!"") or uses them as foundations for melodic exploration: over the course of its five minutes, ""Turn Up the Lights"" magically changes its tenor from paranoid to optimistic without ever deviating from its core bassline or metronomic kick-drum beat. And with their usual matter-of-fact manifestos replaced by a more gentle harmony vocal, ""I Want You"" stands as <i>Clay Class</i>' greatest breakthrough, as the duo hew toward pop <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13400-xx/"" target=""_blank"">xx</a>-ability by proffering a more personal, intimate narrative than their hardened worldview normally allows. Compared to the dramatic artistic strides that kindred spirits These New Puritans made on their sophomore release (2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13951-hidden/"" target=""_blank"">Hidden</a></i>), <i>Clay Class</i> feels disappointingly stagnant. But it does offer encouraging signs that a blade of grass or two can sprout up from cracks in Prinzhorn Dance School's cold, concrete world.</p></div>"|16231.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16231-prinzhorn-dance-school/|7.0|Stuart Berman

Most artists deploying horror-movie imagery and shock tactics inevitably succumb to campy theatricality (as seen in everyone from Marilyn Manson to the earliest iteration of the Horrors), or are quick to explain it away as just a ruse (e.g., Odd Future saying <a href=""http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/music/6477157-421/hot-button-hip-hop.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">they're just joshin' with all that rape-and-murder business</a>), and lest we forget that the most well-worn metaphor used to describe death metal invokes <a href=""http://www.metalinjection.net/tv/view/4558/cookie-monster-discusses-his-influence-on-death-metal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a character from Sesame Street</a>. But the songs that have startled me the most-- Suicide's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5wJQkvSoOQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Frankie Teardrop""</a>, Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn25TYYGXfw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hard-On for Love""</a>, the Jesus Lizard's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQXmikkfwUk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Killer McHann""</a>-- are unnerving to me not so much for their overt aggression as their matter-of-fact realism, where the line between singer and subject is blurred, and sound and fury coalesce into a vivid, very real portrait of violent psychosis.</p>
<p>New York foursome <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/population1280"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pop. 1280</a> are not shy about showing their hand-- they take their name from a Jim Thompson crime novel about a killer cop, and they've given their first full-length album the self-explanatory title of <i>The Horror</i>. Pop. 1280 wallow in the same pool of pigfuck sloppy seconds as East Coast contemporaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5308-pissed-jeans/"" target=""_blank"">Pissed Jeans</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29754-the-men/"" target=""_blank"">the Men</a>, but where those bands respectively soften their blows (somewhat) with wry observations about domesticity and knowing classic-rock references, Pop. 1280 offer no such salve. If the ray-gunned synth-punk stylings of the band's debut 2010 EP, <i>The Grid</i>, suggested a certain fondness for cheeky, B-movie thrills, <i>The Horror</i> is a far more traumatic experience, conjuring all the dystopian futurism of an early David Cronenberg film, but delivered with merciless, medieval brute force. The first words we hear on the album are ""two dogs fucking""; it proves to be <i>The Horror</i>'s most romantic lyric.</p>
<p>Band co-founders Chris Bug and Ivan Lip recorded <i>The Horror</i> with a different drummer and keyboardist from <i>The Grid</i>, and the difference is immediately palpable-- rather than provide a clear separation of bass, synths, and Lip's Birthday Party-esque guitar scrapes, the three elements are often compacted into one monolithic, doomy frequency that hangs over the record like a cloud of black smoke. But new drummer Zach Ziemann does a fine job of pushing the proverbial boulder up the mountain. For all its oppressive heaviness, <i>The Horror</i> has energy and verve to spare: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12838-bodies-in-the-dunes/"" target=""_blank"">""Bodies in the Dunes""</a> sets its apocalyptic death-toll imagery to a heart-racing tribal stomp that doesn't relent for five minutes, while ""New Electronix"" sounds like a summit between 1990s Touch and Go greats Brainiac and Girls Against Boys. Ironically, when Bug starts shouting out explicit dance-move instructions (""Hips to the right/ And hips to the left!"") on ""Nature Boy"", the song's convulsing groove slows to a sludgy grind, making his directives sound less like an invitation to shimmy than militaristic orders shouted at some poor captive trapped at the bottom of a well.</p>
<p>Bug isn't the most dynamic vocalist-- sounding not unlike Liars' Angus Andrew played at 16 rpm-- but for a band as harsh as this, he need not display a range of emotions so long as he convincingly conveys the right ones: grim and grimmer. And it's <i>The Horror</i>'s dirgey digressions that actually best showcase his cold-blooded character, whether shaming a submissive subject into acting like a dog on ""Beg Like a Human"", or taking no small amount of glee in describing the agonizing process of dying by the noose on ""Hang Em' High"". In a world this bleak, the best you can hope for is a quick, easy death, and yet even then Pop. 1280 won't let you off that easy-- as Bug cautions us at the outset, ""Life after death is a painful life."" But he can rest assured that, with an album as unabashedly grim and unforgiving as <i>The Horror</i>, he needn't have to worry about being granted eternal salvation.</p></div>"|16243.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16243-pop-1280/|7.5|Stuart Berman

But we've got a few months' perspective on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15856-wilco/"" target=""_blank"">The Whole Love</a> </i>now<i>, </i>and this new release unearths a track from <a href=""http://wilcoworld.net/#!/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wilco</a>'s 1995 debut, <i>A.M., </i>which suggests they're getting back to the business of being a pop band. They aren't curtailing their experimental urges so much as they're putting more emphasis on tight songs they'd want to play and you'd want to hear in a semi-live setting. There is, in other words, a retrospective undercurrent to <i>iTunes Session</i>, which, instead of including the 10-minute krautrock jams and noise-rock punctuations of their early-2000s heyday, looks to the song-oriented period just before and just after.</p>
<p>Rethinking what it means to be Wilco has always been a big part of being Wilco, so the inclusion of the 17-year-old ""Passenger Side"" suggests a band seriously reassessing its past and drawing strong connections between the Wilco of 1995, the Wilco of 2002, and the Wilco of 2012. The band has exhibited an enduring propensity for noisy undercurrents, concise vocal hooks, and unexpected nods to pop history, all of which are animated by Tweedy's lyrics, which range from invigorated nonsense (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12243-i-might/"" target=""_blank"">""I Might""</a>) to semi-tragic lucidity (""Passenger Side""). Toward that end, <i>iTunes Session</i> emphasizes the immediate over the arty, omitting the rambling <i>Whole Love </i>opener ""Art of Almost"" in favor of that album's catchiest tracks and choosing the direly hooky ""War on War"" instead of some of the strident tracks from their catalog.</p>
<p>For those of us who prefer Wilco's pop songs over their avant-garde numbers, this is a strong, short set, emphasizing buoyant momentum over digressive din. The tracks don't sound quite as full in this setting as they did on <i>The Whole Love</i>, but there's still a lot of charm and dynamism in the way the bass and keyboards trade off the ascending/ descending riff on ""I Might"", like kids taking turns on the playground slide. If this version surpasses the studio take, it's largely due to Tweedy's exaggerated sighs. Only ""Black Moon"" suffers in this setting, becoming so lax that it threatens to dissipate altogether. It's clear the band is less interested in that sort of high-concept noodling than they are in simply jamming.</p>
<p>In that regard, Wilco have hijacked the <i>iTunes Session</i> and turned it into a document of the <i>Whole Love </i>tour. These are, ostensibly, crowd favorites, tightened and refined in front of big crowds. They even bring out avuncular opening act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5344-nick-lowe/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Lowe</a> for a workmanlike rendering of his 1979 hit <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0l3QWUXVho"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cruel to Be Kind""</a>, a regular encore over the last few months. It's a fine song, a bit redundant and not quite as relevant to the band as their B-side cover of Lowe's ""I Love My Label"", but you can hear how much fun Wilco (or ""Wilc-Lowe,"" as Tweedy introduced the band at a recent show in Chicago) are having just singing those doo-doo-doo's.</p>
<p>Lowe is, in fact, an intriguing forebear for Wilco, a man who transformed himself seemingly effortlessly from a post-punk smartass into a genial country crooner. More recently, he's settled into a gentle nostalgia that lends his recent albums-- specifically <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10399-at-my-age/"" target=""_blank"">At My Age</a></i> and <i>That Old Magic</i>-- a wistful gravity that pushes against any notion of granddad rock. Similarly, Tweedy seems intent on forging a lengthy career with just as many twists and turns, dark corners, and bright avenues. Which is where this new version of ""Passenger Side"" comes in: Just as Lowe's country material has proven every bit as sturdy as his Stiff Records output, Wilco are pointing to some hidden gems in their own catalog, rehabbing forgotten tunes to prove that the band hasn't gotten better or worse, just different. That old song, so straightforward and unassuming, settles in remarkably well among their more recent, more celebrated material, so how long till dBpm releases a deluxe reissue of <i>A.M.</i>?</p></div>"|16227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16227-itunes-sessions/|6.7|Stephen M.

A <a href=""http://www.brainwashed.com/wc/?p=9"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog post</a> from Windy, published in late 2011, describes the making of <i>We Will Always Be</i>, framing it in the context of their relationship. ""Yeah, we have had bumps in the road, and on occasion it seems as if we may never recover from these bumps, but we do,"" she wrote. That type of candor doesn't stop at the written word; it also bleeds through into the duo's music. Often their work is collaborative, at other times there are vast expanses of sound featuring Carl playing alone. Either way, this album, their first since <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12327-songs-for-the-broken-hearted/"">Songs for the Broken Hearted</a></i> in 2008, is executed with openness and sincerity, making it feel as if the usual barriers between audience and performer simply aren't there. When Windy &amp; Carl lock together, it's like being privy to a great secret, imparted in a moment of intensely personal creativity.</p>
<p>This record shifts through three distinct phases, with a definitive beginning, middle, and end. It travels from temperate ripples at the start through craggy rock faces in the center. The close is like an impossibly smooth glide across freshly laid snow. As with most of Windy &amp; Carl's music, the lyrics are frequently indecipherable. The emotional impact is torn from the overall feel, which shifts from rueful acoustic work (""For Rosa"") to forceful, repetitive drone rock (""Fainting in the Presence of the Lord""). The spaces in-between those extremes are smudged with color, sometimes bearing the kind of drifty essence <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> mustered up on ""To Here Knows When"". Like Kevin Shields and Bilinda Butcher, Windy &amp; Carl's work often resembles the sound of a couple retreating from the world in order to understand their place within it.</p>
<p>The way <i>We Will Always Be</i> is put together only adds to that feeling. It resembles an orderly dissection of the relationship cycle, where unruffled, carefree beginnings melt into discord and conflict, ultimately settling into the strange kind of parity that outsiders to any long-term relationship find hard to fathom. Their musical assimilation of that rocky mid-section, where the delicate framework of understanding built up around a couple feels as if it could crash and fall at any minute, is the most spectacular. It begins in the climb out of ""Remember"" and into ""Fainting in the Presence of the Lord"". The latter, almost 19 minutes long, is full of cadaverous twirls of processed noise, which get sucked into an atom-smashing guitar loop that trudges into the middle of the song, heaving it to a lumbering close. Whatever Windy &amp; Carl are working out here, which even Windy's candid blog posts don't reveal, it's clearly taken them to some dark places.</p>
<p>Despite feeling like the work of a couple laying themselves bare, it's also music to get lost in, to block out the real world. You could stretch out for days in the quiet whirr of Carl's ring-shaped instrumental passages. That duality of purpose is one of the greatest strengths Windy &amp; Carl possess-- the ability to conjure up contrasting feelings through their work. It's what makes an album like <i>We Will Always Be</i> worth returning to often, with different aspects of it coming to light depending on mood, setting, and personal circumstance. In a heartbeat it can flick from the sinister whispered vocals of ""Nature of Memory"" to the serene ice-drones of ""Looking Glass"". But it never feels like forced change. There's always a natural bridge taking you from one world to the next, like a guide taking you through Windy &amp; Carl's singular ways, providing this album with the conceptual heft it feeds on to flourish.</p></div>"|16222.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16222-we-will-always-be/|7.4|Nick Neyland

In other words, a group that has to this point been either compared to shoegazers or other Scottish acts (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28-aereogramme/"" target=""_blank"">Aereogramme</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"" target=""_blank"">Mogwai</a>) was looking to completely overhaul its sound. That's a good thing-- while their debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10111-fourteen-autumns-and-fifteen-winters/"" target=""_blank"">Fourteen Autumns and Fifteen Winters</a> </i>was the work of a powerful and fully realized band, its follow-up <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13493-forget-the-night-ahead/"" target=""_blank"">Forget the Night Ahead</a> </i>suggested it wasn't a particularly versatile one. Whether it was a result of familiarity or just its suffocated production, the torrential downpour of Andy MacFarlane's guitars and James Graham's heavily accented howl didn't have the same impact.</p>
<p>Now here's a nearly complete list of who <i>No One Can Ever Know </i>actually sounds like: The Twilight Sad. That's also a good thing. <i>No One Can Ever Know </i>is kind of a failure as a total sonic rebranding, but it's a strong transition for the band into something a little more form-fitting while carrying over their commitment to morose atmosphere and Graham's handsome vocals, deeply entrenched characteristics that just so happen to be their strengths.</p>
<p>Still, that they brought in Andrew Weatherall to produce is proof enough that they meant business. The mention of Weatherall's name most instantly brings to mind his work on Primal Scream's <i>Screamadelica </i>and Fuck Buttons' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13617-tarot-sport/"" target=""_blank"">Tarot Sport</a></i>, two records whose wildly bright timbres and celebratory attitudes exist somewhere way the fuck on the other side of the world from where the Twilight Sad set up shop. That's still the case if song titles like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12457-kill-it-in-the-morning/"" target=""_blank"">""Kill It in the Morning""</a> and ""Dead City"" are any indication of what's to come, and they sure are. It's tough to pinpoint the exact contributions, but whether Weatherall was meant as a spiritual adviser or a contributor is a moot point-- the Twilight Sad intended for this to be a frigid, militant, and rhythmic record, and they got it.</p>
<p>The main difference is the shape these songs allow themselves to take: ""Cold Days From the Birdhouse"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11351-i-became-a-prostitute/"" target=""_blank"">""I Became a Prostitute""</a> achieved weapons-grade catharsis by cresting and crashing unexpectedly, visually represented by right-angle dynamics. No longer able to fall back on volcanic distortion to bring the big moments, the Twilight Sad have more curvature and forward motion, something closer to the color-drained gothic clangor of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11706-seventeen-seconds-faith-pornography/"" target=""_blank"">Pornography</a>-</i>era Cure (""Don't Look at Me"") or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrTB-iiecqk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Street Spirit""</a>/<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ1iMQA0egc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Knives Out""</a> Radiohead (particularly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12640-sick/"" target=""_blank"">""Sick""</a>) than any of the post-punk firebrands they namechecked. Accordions (or approximations thereof) wheeze, artificial strings moan, and guitars are thick with distortion, yet everything feels of a single piece, and at first it makes <i>No One </i>feel a bit limited dynamically compared to its predecessors. But it's a record more about obsession than release, and the mesmerizing, cyclical guitar figures of ""Sick"" and the throttle-down locomotion of ""Don't Move"" make the best use of repetition as a conveyance of passion.</p>
<p>Easy as it is to dwell on the instrumental changes, <i>No One </i>focuses on what might not be Graham's rangiest performance, but certainly his most absorbing. His vocals have always been too prominent to make the shoegaze comparisons stick, and he's just less of a competitor for sonic space this time around, which is key to understanding <i>No One</i>'s appeal. Though an undoubtedly emotive singer, Graham isn't much of a details guy-- there was something post-traumatic about <i>Fourteen </i>and <i>Forget</i>, the sudden rupturing of the music acting as a counterbalance to Graham's lyrics, which were evocative in a general sense and every bit as repressed in a literal one. The emotions were identifiable, the events not so much. There was no real way to determine what they were ""about"" specifically, which is true of <i>No One Can Ever Know </i>as well, but there's a crucial role reversal for both Graham and the listener, in that the former is an aggressor rather than a victim and the latter is assumed to actually be in on the conversation rather than being a therapeutic sounding board. Or maybe we're in on a confession-- Graham's words are carefully chosen and ominous, something like an urgent call on a tapped phone. Something has clearly gone wrong, possibly a murder but definitely a love crime.</p>
<p>Throughout, Graham does little to distinguish between the two, he and an unnamed other ""paired off in the violence."" The chorus of subtly dramatic opener ""Alphabet"" contains the Twilight Sad's most surefooted melody and Graham's most legible declaration: ""So sick to death of the sight of you now/ Safe to say I've never wanted you more."" Likewise, on ""Don't Move"", Graham's brogue smears the album's two parallel, primal instincts (""I want you more than you will ever know"" and ""I'll <i>hurt </i>you more than you will ever know""), his dead-eyed recitation of those words betraying that he's hanging on for dear life to any kind of sanity. It's not really accurate to call ""Kill It in the Morning"" delayed gratification-- not when <i>No One</i> is actually the most sedate <i>and </i>evil Twilight Sad album--<i> </i>but after five minutes of spiky industrial grind, the music drops out for an exasperated Graham to yell, ""What more do you need to know?/ It's staying here well down below.""</p>
<p>It gives the feeling of a story completed, and while the wholeness of <i>No One </i>is absorbing to those in tune with the Twilight Sad's relentlessly downbeat demeanor, it's easy to see it as forbidding or impenetrable. Multiple listens reveal layers instead of peaks, and that's to be expected from a band for whom volume and texture meant more than melody: While the greyscale atmopsherics of ""Nil"" and ""Not Sleeping"" contribute to <i>No One</i>'s sonic consistency, if you don't immediately take a shine to Graham's mantric vocals, there aren't a lot of thrills to find in the cushy synth pads behind him. But even if <i>No One Can Ever Know </i>is more of a way to please those already down for the cause than a means of bringing new listeners into the fold, the attempts to push the boundaries of sound and setting result in the least-insular Twilight Sad album to date-- the kids are still on fire, they've just left the bedroom.</p></div>"|16189.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16189-no-one-can-ever-know/|7.4|Ian Cohen

Founded in 1981, when punk's initial explosion was still ricocheting around globe, the Christchurch, New Zealand-based label put its faith in scrappy, locally grown pop-- music that was heavy on the jangly guitars, but generally low on polish, bands like the Clean, the Bats, the Chills, and the Tall Dwarfs.</p>
<p>Virtually every decent guitar record pressed in the three decades since has owed some sort of debt to the Kiwi jangle pop-- see Galaxie 500's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14083-today-on-fire-this-is-our-music/"" target=""_blank"">On Fire</a>, </i>Pavement's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8969-slanted-enchanted-luxe-reduxe/"" target=""_blank"">Slanted &amp; Enchanted</a></i>, or Yo La Tengo's <i>Painful</i>. I'm convinced that ""Pink Frosty"", from Fugazi's <i>End Hits</i> is a nod to the Chills' spooky post-punk classic, ""Pink Frost"", though I've never taken the initiative to verify it. (But, come on; listen to them <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjW3MT8D9RY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">back</a> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NsXoGOZX5Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">back</a> and tell me that they aren't similar.)</p>
<p>More recently, bands such as Real Estate, Woods, Vivian Girls, and Crystal Stilts (basically, anything on Brooklyn-born record label Woodsist) have picked up the torch for the jangle-pop side of imprint's oeuvre. It would wrong to label it a revival, though. In 30 years, the Flying Nun sound has never slipped too far from the conversation.</p>
<p><i>Tally Ho</i> is Flying Nun's greatest-hits record, released partly to honor the label's 30th birthday. A 2xCD set, the compilation bundles together tunes from across the label's catalog, from late-1980s classics to material gleaned from more recent signings.<span> </span>Flying Nun is no stranger to comp records. The label has already gathered together its out-of-print singles (<i>Where in the World is Wendy Broccoli?</i>), lauded its contributions to the indie-pop landscape (<i>Speed of Sound</i>), celebrated at least three birthdays with label-history-spanning mix CDs (10th, 21st years) and, for the 25th anniversary, an exhaustive 4xCD box set.</p>
<p>This time around, they go for the middle ground. The late-1980s groups that established the label's legend are all accounted for and frequently represented by their most recognizable songs, such as the Chills' shimmering <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvYihKlgzOg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heavenly Pop Hit""</a> and the Clean's three-chord classic, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm3UGftvCRo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tally Ho!""</a> from which the collection takes its name. But <i>Tally Ho</i> also weaves in some of the roster's lesser known acts-- bands like Look Blue Go Purple, Sneaky Feelings, and the Headless Chickens, that, until now, only your Audio Galaxy-mining college roommate ever had the wherewithal to dig up. The comp makes a concerted effort to avoid short changing Flying Nun's newer additions, but most seem skippable when slotted alongside groups from the label's late-80s to mid-90s golden era.</p>
<p>Hearing 30 years of Flying Nun records stacked up alongside one another speaks well to the breadth of the label's taste. While the Dunedin Sound-- the jangle pop tones favored by the Chills, the Bats, and the Clean-- tends to steal the spotlight, Flying Nun's aesthetic is not easily pigeonholed.<span> </span>The label also ponied up the cash to release aggressive and noisy music, such as the Gordons, New Zealand's answer to Flipper (who later morphed into the more overtly psychedelic Bailter Space), and scrape and drone pioneers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5096-the-dead-c/"" target=""_blank"">the Dead C</a>. Loud, brutal, druggy music that couldn't possibly score a radio hit, even at the bottom of the world.</p></div>"|16240.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16240-va-tally-ho-flying-nuns-greatest-bits/|7.6|Aaron Leitko

So it's surprising how subtle, sedate, and frankly unlike their former selves <i>They!Live </i>turns out to be; the transformation reminds me of raver friends who hooked up on a drug binge and then promptly moved out to the suburbs to grow vegetables together.</p>
<p>There was a honeymoon moment where the partying trajectory carried through the first flush of romance: On their first single together, last year's aptly named ""Creeper"", Daneeka and Damage hit upon the best of all possible worlds, offering a throbbing bad dream of strobing, bleepy synth organ riffs over remorseless 4x4 kick drums, if not ""Show Me Love"" then maybe ""Show Me Anxiety"". In the tune's second half, after a build up that becomes more deliciously interminable with each replay, they unleash a thunderous rave breakbeat rhythm over a woman's outraged declaration, ""you're nasty!""-- the massiveness of the revelation made possible only by the drawn-out nature of the slow-reveal. In its simplicity and patience, ""Creeper"" seemed at odds with both the rave revivalism it superficially referenced (in truth the result was closer to early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4418-underworld/"" target=""_blank"">Underworld</a>) and the typically cluttered post-everything maximalism of current UK dance music (not to mention Damage and Daneeka's own pasts).</p>
<p><i>They!Live </i>stretches the already strained relationship further, offering nine voluptuously melancholy tech-house slowburners, each trying to outdo the other for how tightly wound it can hold itself, how reluctantly it can give up its secrets. In many ways this is a fine thing, not least because even as they embrace grayscale, pseudo-minimal tech-house with gusto, the duo cannot help but infuse the arrangements with its trademark rhythmic restlessness, evidenced less by a riot of percussion than by its careful, strategic deployment within slippery, snaking grooves, like the papery, syncopated snares weaving in and out of the distracted, sleepy female vocals of ""Battleships"", or the stop-start tango struggling to emerge out of the bleak techno pound of ""Ellipsis Torment"", or the tiny, irresistible drum rolls that seem so out-of-place and yet so welcome on the otherwise severe, glacial closer ""Bleach &amp; Penicillin"".</p>
<p>But it's a problem for <i>They!Live</i> that a foreshortened, less charming ""Creeper"", if not the album's loudest moment, remains by some distance its most memorable and gregarious, with only the melancholy stutters of ""Charlottenburg"" and the clipped, synth-driven house of ""Juggernaut"" coming remotely close. Part of the problem, though only part, is that the duo have swapped a Spartan (albeit decreasingly so) musical landscape for a densely populated one, and then set out about erasing any tell-tale signs that they haven't been living in the neighborhood forever. Maybe they need to hang out with the locals more: Like many UK producers who have travelled to Berlin and become entranced by its techno culture, Damage and Daneeka have absorbed much of the city's musical seriousness and subtlety, and some of its emotional sweep, but too little of its frenzy or perverse sense of humor. It'd be much easier to love, as opposed to merely like, <i>They!Live</i>'s glistening, long-form tech-house soundscapes if there were more bombs and curveballs hidden amongst its lovingly pruned forest glades.</p></div>"|16241.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16241-theylive/|6.1|Tim Finney

In one sense, the ideas here are ones we've heard from Cohen before: Life is a nostalgic, sorrowful experience punctuated by the occasional joke; language can clarify as much as it can obscure; and lust is one of the highest forms of prayer. In another sense, Cohen is telling us that the ideas on this album-- home, healing, origins, and endings-- are ideas that take on a starker, more metaphorical weight as time goes on. We can trust Cohen to know: Over the past 77 years, he has, in a graceful but inevitable way, become old.</p>
<p>Cohen's voice has always sounded deep, flat, and naturalistic-- the kind of performance that attempts to sound like it's no performance at all. To describe the changes in it over the past 10 or 15 years, I defer in part to those little booklets that come around the necks of good Scotch: A powerful body of peat smoke with a briny finish. In essence, a whisper-- the voice of a voice whose center has been carved away. <i>Old Ideas</i> doesn't remind me of Bob Dylan as much it does of late Johnny Cash records, or even Charlie Louvin's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12534-steps-to-heaven-charlie-louvin-sings-murder-ballads-and-disaster-songs/"" target=""_parent"">Steps to Heaven</a></i>: documents of voices so heavy and close that to hear them is to smell the singer's breath and see the gradient of yellow on their teeth.</p>
<p>It's easy to think of Cohen as a folksinger since ""folksinger"" is common shorthand for musicians who tend to privilege words over music. Cohen, though, tends to go where his musical collaborators and arrangers lead him, whether it's grimy dive-bar ballads, disco, bare-bones guitar blues, or orchestral elaborations. For a Zen monk who started his career as a poet, Leonard Cohen has used a lot of synth horns.</p>
<p><i>Old Ideas</i> is a spare, low-key album rooted in blues and gospel-- maybe the closest thing he's made to ""folk"" music since the early 1970s. Backup singers sing passionate, wordless melodies; the bass sounds like the big, upright kind. I think it's his first studio album in 20 years to not rely exclusively on drum machines for percussion. The musical setting suits the state of his voice, which is meant as a mixed compliment: One of the great things about hearing his 1980s and 1990s albums was trying to reconcile his heroic presence with all the Casios. Some of the best moments on <i>Old Ideas</i>-- like the bizarre foregrounding of synthesizer during the album's first thirty seconds-- prove that Cohen and his collaborators have the wits to remind listeners that as soon as tape is rolling, nothing-- no croak, no wail, no plea-- is all-natural.</p>
<p>Cohen's voice alone, though, is a gorgeous, singular instrument. It carries in it a quality that is difficult to discuss without either becoming sentimental or appealing to the misguided idea that just because you play an acoustic guitar or sing close to the microphone, what you do is more honest than someone who attempts to create an experience of truth in some other way. It's a voice that mimics states of human yearning: The point at which we start to sound too tired or worn-down to speak, the point at which we start to cry, the way we whisper to people whom we are very, very close.</p>
<p>Maybe it's only context that makes me think that songs such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12807-show-me-the-place/"" target=""_blank"">""Show Me the Place""</a>, where his voice becomes so weak it nearly falls silent in the middle of a line, is anything more than maudlin. Maybe the past 40-plus years of music serve as some kind of apology, as though to publicly reckon with the fact that according to the World Bank you are fast approaching life expectancy is something Cohen-- or any human being-- needs to earn their right to.</p>
<p>This is not the best album Cohen has put out. It is also not <i>The Bucket List</i>-- certainly not cheap or trivial or trading on his age alone. The songs are decent, the singing is stunning. He claims to be naked and filthy. He claims to be a lazy bastard. He claims to have been a slave for love. But he has claimed these things before. He is as old as he has ever been.</p></div>"|16228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16228-leonard-cohen-old-ideas/|7.4|Mike Powell

But the genre's most esteemed icons have ultimately survived because they've occasionally been willing to break down rock's rigidity to absorb decidedly non-rock influences, be it the Stones flirting with reggae and disco on <i>Black and Blue</i>, Paul McCartney trying his hand at new wave on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15536-mccartney-mccartney-ii/"" target=""_blank"">McCartney II</a></i>, or Neil Young's infamous synth-pop odyssey <i>Trans</i>. None of these may count as those artists' definitive works but, given that rock'n'roll itself began as an unholy union of blues, jazz, folk, and country, these sorts of sacreligious stylistic detours and genre experiments were arguably truer to the music's original spirit than anything that tried to milk fresh inspiration from the I, IV, and V chords.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9561-jennifer-herrema/"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Herrema</a>'s first band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux/"" target=""_blank"">Royal Trux</a>, understood this all too well, as she and partner Neil Hagerty broke down and reassembled their 1970s blues-rock foundation into all sorts of distorted shapes over the course of a tangled, tangential 10-album discography. But since that band dissolved in 2001, Herrema has been following a more linear path with her post-Trux outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3652-rtx/"" target=""_blank"">RTX</a>, who, with each successive record, have been gradually refining and polishing themselves into the last hair-metal band standing-- a stance so antithetical to prevailing indie-rock mores, it's practically avant garde. If Royal Trux were about deconstructing rock mythology, RTX aggressively reasserted it, from the cover-art drawings of Herrema that look like they were cribbed from some daydreaming high-school student's notepad, to giving their studio albums titles such as <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12407-jj-got-live-ratx/"" target=""_blank"">JJ Got Live RaTX</a></i> that suggest they're some long-lost concert bootleg, to the intra-band references (RTX being an acronym that first appeared in the 1990 Royal Trux track ""RTX-USA"") that casts Herrema's entire oeuvre as some sort of secret-society code waiting to be deciphered.</p>
<p>The narrative gets even more convoluted with the arrival of <a href=""http://www.blackbananasband.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Bananas</a>, which boasts the same personnel as RTX; copped its name from an RTX song lyric; and whose debut album title, <i>Rad Times Xpress IV</i>, makes a smidgen of sense only if seen as the fourth RTX effort. (It also includes a song titled, confusingly enough, ""RTX Go-Go"".) And RTX's penchant for straight-up sleazy rock'n'roll carried through to the new band's first public offering last fall, a faithful cover of the Stones' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12712-before-they-make-me-run-ft-kurt-vile-rolling-stones-cover/"" target=""_blank"">""Before They Make Me Run""</a>, complete with an uncannily Neil Hagerty-like guest vocal from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Vile</a> that actually makes the song sound more like Royal Trux than anything RTX ever attempted.</p>
<p>But that cover selection proves prophetic not for its form but for its source: 1978's <i>Some Girls</i>, arguably the Stones' most stylistically varied album, what with Mick Jagger channelling his New York-nightlife escapades into the Studio 54 strut of ""Miss You"" and the CBGB snarl of ""Shattered"". Following the same logic, Herrema fashions Black Bananas as an alternate-universe RTX who aren't afraid to absorb more modern influences like synth-pop, hip-hop, French-touch house, and (for 10 seconds of ""RTX Go-Go"" at least) dancehall, while guitarist Brian McKinley lays off the usual Eddie Van Halen histrionics in favor of lysergic Eddie Hazel funk. The album doesn't so much begin as burst its dam, with opener ""It's Cool"" arriving in such a thick surge of wah-wahed guitars and phased-out synths, it takes you a minute to realize the song actually adheres to standard blues structure.</p>
<p>In accommodating all of these disparate sound sources in a limited-range but densely textured mix, <i>Rad Times Xpress IV</i> finds a direct antecedent in Royal Trux's 1998 classic <i>Accelerator</i> (which essentially sounded like an arena-rock band playing inside of a vacuum cleaner) while feeling remarkably of a piece with contemporary strains of chillwave and electro-rock. (To wit, Black Bananas' first North American tour sees them opening for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28390-sleigh-bells/"" target=""_blank"">Sleigh Bells</a>.) Where past RTX albums faithfully approximated the flash and thrash of 1980s metal with all the diligence of a Civil War reenactment, <i>Rad Times Xpress IV</i> illuminates how well that music lends itself to more experimental renderings (the tape-decayed boogie of ""TV Trouble"" and ""Hot Stupid"" sound like Aerosmith as produced by Ariel Pink; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12836-rad-times/"" target=""_blank"">""Rad Times""</a> crosswires Kraftwerkian funk and KISS crunch) while the songs seemingly engineered to hold onto RTX's denim'n'leather constituency yield surprises: ""Acid Song"" is actually a sultry slow jam, and ""Killer Weed"" rides its Ted Nugent riffs into a dubby denouement. However, even as its title track excitedly welcomes us to ""The future! The future!,"" <i>Rad Times Xpress IV</i> doesn't shy away from referencing Herrema's notorious junkie past, as ""Foxy Playground"" recounts all the times and ways she ""could've died."" But instead of playing up the pathos of that sentiment, the song's slinky bounce effectively plays it for laughs, and for good reason: Twenty-four years into her musical career and still busting skulls, Jennifer Herrema is not about to let a little rumination on mortality get in the way of a rad time.</p></div>"|16209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16209-black-bananas/|7.8|Stuart Berman

But his musical development across records he's made for Thrill Jockey since his band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/33804-wzt-hearts-part-ways/"" target=""_blank"">Wzt Hearts broke up</a> is clear. <i>Husbands</i>, from 2009, offered mostly thick drones, suggesting a digital take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"" target=""_blank"">Spacemen 3</a>'s further-out meditations. Dub-inflected loops lurked beneath the drones on 2010's <i>Fussing &amp; Fighting</i> 12"". Now, on his best effort yet,<i> I Love You</i>, Urick's dub obsessions have moved to the front of the room.</p>
<p>Urick hasn't abandoned drone-- layers of noise and columns of sound remain primary colors in his palette. But what sticks strongest in memory after <i>I Love You</i> flows through your ears are the hypnotic cycles of bass, beat, and melody. Think of drone as the light Urick shines on his loops, or the water he sprays on them: The sheen makes them glisten and thicken as they slowly gain texture, but they hold up through the noise, rarely burning out or washing away under the busy sonics.</p>
<p>The clearest and perhaps catchiest example is <i>I Love You</i>'s middle track, ""Ageless Isms"". It opens with a reggae hook, which Urick douses in brittle screech, warps with wavy noise, and stretches with phases that seem to stop time. All of these moves make the song radiate, even as the original hook gets cut until it bleeds. By the end, that hook is no longer prominent, but its ghost persists like a shadow stretching past the horizon.</p>
<p>Such morphing is perhaps what Urick means when he explains how the album title (taken from a film about a man obsessed with a talking keychain that says ""I love you"" incessantly) became a personal mantra. ""[I kept] running the phrase over and over in my head,"" he says in press materials, ""until the words started to break down and render the phrase foreign again."" Oddly, the album's most interesting piece, ""Don't Digital"", is its least repetitive. But the way Urick melts all his sounds together, and the hue of Eastern ritual they exude, gives the track a devout feel. It's cyclical in a way that suggests something primal, like the movement of tides or the rotation of the earth.</p>
<p>Which makes the cover image of <i>I Love You</i>-- the crystal-clear ""Blue Marble"" shot of the earth from space-- a bit obvious. But Urick seems uninterested in hiding ideas under ironic distance or opaque sonics. As complex and dense as these five songs can be, you can always hear everything going on. So even when he closes the record with his thickest cut, ""Syndromes"", there's a clear vision that's apparent long before his drones shrink down to a lone rhythm. Maybe that's what Urick means by <i>I Love You</i>-- he's too enamored of the sounds he gathers to lock them up in noise.</p></div>"|16236.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16236-i-love-you/|7.9|Marc Masters

We had <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15725-watch-the-throne/"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z and Kanye</a>, Eminem and Royce Da 5'9"", and of course Gucci Mane, who released two major label duo albums-- the disappointing <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15739-ferrari-boyz/"" target=""_blank"">Ferrari Boyz</a> </i>with <a href=""http://www.wakaflocka1017.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Waka Flocka Flame</a> and the bizarre <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16133-baytl/"" target=""_blank"">BAYTL</a> </i>with Kreayshawn associate V-Nasty. This time out, Waka pairs with <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/frenchmontana"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">French Montana</a>, who has worked extensively with the currently imprisoned Max B, formally of the Harlem based Byrdgang.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Coming from Atlanta by way of New York City, Waka's energetic and aggressive style has endured longer than most probably would have suspected. When he released his first single, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMtJS8jGnt8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""O Let's Do It""</a>, he was mostly known as the guy standing in the shadows of old Gucci Mane and OJ Da Juiceman videos. French Montana has been around for a few more years than Waka in the New York mixtape circuit, but last year's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RrCROBdNp0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Choppa Choppa Down""</a> and his most recent single, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSrVIX_jfdg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shot Caller""</a>, got him signed to Bad Boy Records and got his name out there nationwide. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Given the players, you might expect <i>Lock Out</i> to be an East Coast rap affair, but with a couple of exceptions (the bouncy seriousness of ""Dat All"" and the triumphant finale of ""Promise""), the tape sounds well-grounded in the streets of Atlanta. The production on <i>Lock </i><i>Out</i> is handled mostly by two producers with whom Waka has worked extensively (Southside and Lex Luger), alongside other lesser-knowns who share an appreciation for dark, brooding beats that are, ultimately, pretty hard to distinguish from one another. The first half of the tape finds French Montana struggling to find his footing as his flow reduces songs to a slow creak, while Waka affirms his ability to rip any rap instrumental he comes across. ""1230"" has a great opening verse by Waka, and he delivers one of the strongest hooks on the mixtape, but the momentum that track builds is lost as soon as French appears, as he just cannot keep up with Waka's pace. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">French Montana does have a few moments like ""Call It Dat"", a rare track where they display an equal amount of intensity. The same goes for ""We Mobb"" featuring Prodigy, where French sounds right at home and Waka shows going back to his New York roots can work, as they rap over the beat from Mobb Deep's vintage ""Hell on Earth"". But the more you hear the mixtape, the more you wish they'd found a better middle ground. The first single from Waka's upcoming album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12606-round-of-applause-ft-drake/"" target=""_blank"">""Round of Applause""</a>, produced by Lex Luger, is a great slice of Atlanta strip club music in the vein of Travis Porter, and it's a good match for French's style, since it would allow him to relax his flow a bit. French's recent hit single ""Shot Caller"" is a jazzy New York cut that could use a regional expanding verse energy ball verse from Waka to give it more radio and club appeal. On these songs, you get a better sense of why they'd <i>want</i> to work together, but <i>Lock Out</i> never comes close to that promise.</span></p></div>"|16237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16237-lock-out/|5.0|David Turner

Musicians make this mistake too. Consider vocal processing. The amount of time spent warping, burying, and looping the human voice has increased exponentially as artists have found it an effective tool for bridging the gaps between man and machine (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a>), ecstasy and violence (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a>), past and present (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a>). R&amp;B's delirious emotional states have proven particularly fertile ground for artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29665-jacques-greene/"" target=""_blank"">Jacques Greene</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">How to Dress Well</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29170-autre-ne-veut/"" target=""_blank"">Autre Ne Veut</a>.</p>
<p>Successful applications, all, and while actual output varies, these artists have enough in common that foggy vocals have become a zeitgeist of modern underground music. Enter <a href=""http://www.off-is-love.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">o F F Love</a>, a French transplant living in Berlin, who-- you guessed it-- has mistaken this choral thicket for an end-game. With its sounds of pop and R&amp;B stylized to abstraction, it is impossible to imagine <i>Probably Love</i>, o F F Love's debut LP, dropping any time but the present. One year ago it would've seemed obscure; one year from now, it will sound archaic. o F F Love exists as a prism that refracts the most facile aspects of chillwave, witch-house, and PBR&amp;B to deleterious effect and, in doing so, provides a glimpse of how damaging indie rock's obsession with memory and obfuscation can be.</p>
<p>o F F Love's penchant for obscurity is not just musical. Little is known about the producer, who hides his face behind a scarf and ballcap. Mangled phonetics (e.g. ""Makeupworz"", ""Missthemway (Again)"") aid in building the mystery, I suppose. What little o F F Love media exists-- <a href=""http://www.off-is-love.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a spare website</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/offoffandoff"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a YouTube channel</a>, <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/o-f-f"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a SoundCloud</a>-- indicate an interest in teen-pop fanaticism, potentially fecund territory for a deconstructionist. This fascination proves to be entirely visual, however, as <i>Probably Love</i> establishes a template of queasy vocal refrains, dull kick drums, and aerosol-laced synths. The vocals are provided by o F F Love himself. Or they're sampled. Either way, human voices are slathered in Auto-Tune, reducing the opportunity for a big reveal or the establishment of a discernible vocal presence.</p>
<p>I suspect <i>Probably Love</i> was recorded entirely using software, but ultimately that doesn't matter: What matters is that this album <i>sounds</i> like it's been filtered through an overheated laptop's cooling fan, so shrill is its palate. <i>Probably Love</i> smolders in this dissonant, digital pit, its every minor chord, snare hit, and intonation laid to waste by hot, harsh circuits. The tempos do not help. <i>Probably Love</i> sputters, distended phrasing and echoing snares left to linger: The shrieking, nauseous interjections of ""Be Around U"" and rudderless vowels of ""Everyday, My Holy Day"" are egregious offenders. The cumulative effect is advanced narcolepsy, someone blowing spit bubbles with soft synths and drum machines. When o F F Love does allow a quicker tempo to invade-- such as on the almost pretty masturbation fantasy ""Beating for You""-- it predictably drags his vocals out of the muck as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps you think I'm missing the point, that o F F Love's blur&amp;B contains some hard-won beauty or relevant commentary. But <i>Probably Love</i> isn't beautiful; its ugliness and pessimism exhaust me. And what greater point could he be making? <i>Probably Love</i> is the frightful dead-end of so many recent trends, the point at which we lose sight of what question is being answered, what volley is being returned.</p></div>"|16232.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16232-probably-love/|2.9|Andrew Gaerig

That album's tracks, and those of the home recordings she also released that year, were sparse, Van Etten's voice sometimes barely above a murmur, as if she were trying to figure out how to make music at the lowest functional volume. Her next record, 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14690-epic/"" target=""_blank"">Epic</a></i>, was almost more of an EP-- just seven songs-- but it was a leap forward in sound and spirit. <i>Epic</i> pulled in little bits of kickdrum and pedal steel and electric guitar, and ended with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11768-love-more/"" target=""_blank"">""Love More""</a>, on which she proclaimed, over a doubled harmonium and wavering synth, ""You chained me like a dog in our room/ …It made me love, it made me love, it made me love more.""</p>
<p>Van Etten first recorded <a href=""http://www.shakingthrough.com/sharonvanetten"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Love More"" for WXPN</a> and Weathervane Music's Shaking Through web series, which captured the session on video. It was one of her first in-earnest collaborations with other musicians, and can almost see new synapses firing behind her eyes: <i>this is what music can be, this is what I can be</i>. It's fitting that the same song grabbed the attention of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a>'s Aaron Dessner, who wound up producing <i>Tramp</i>, her first album for Jagjaguwar. The new tracks come from a year and a half of sessions wedged in whenever Dessner and Van Etten were both off tour. It includes appearances by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5739-wye-oak/"" target=""_blank"">Wye Oak</a>'s Jenn Wasner, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27876-julianna-barwick/"" target=""_blank"">Julianna Barwick</a>, Dessner's brother/bandmate Bryce, and other friends of the sort that apparently tend to ""just drop by"" when you're a celebrated musician/producer with a studio in your Brooklyn garage. That Van Etten has been given the time and space and resources to feel out her path, unhurried by the tyrannous buzz cycle, is both a total luxury, and totally vital.</p>
<p>It's the default assumption that a female songwriter, performing under her own name, is ""confessional,"" that she's serving up some dark part of her soul for the world's consumption. And maybe one day Van Etten will slip into the voices of strangers just as easily as she inhabits her own. But for now, confession is still very much the thing. ""It's self-therapy,"" Van Etten has said to nearly every interviewer who has asked, and more and more that seems to refer to both the writing and the production of her songs; that she can draw out the words, bring them into a room with other human beings, and together with them lay something beautiful on tape is both transformative and redemptive.</p>
<p>Matters of mistrust, isolation, and uncomfortable togetherness dominate <i>Tramp</i>, rolling through every track like a sick, creeping fog. Maybe Van Etten is still nursing the psychic wounds carved into her by that one Tennessee boyfriend, or maybe it's something else; either way, she sounds, at last, good and angry and ready to put up a fight. First comes the dark jangle of ""Warsaw"", then the calculated frankness of ""Give Out"" (""You're the reason why I'll move to the city/ Or why I'll need to leave”). On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12810-serpents/"" target=""_blank"">""Serpents""</a>, the album's lead single, she scoffs, ""I had a thought you would take me seriously."" As guitars strain at their tethers and Walkmen drummer Matt Barrick pounds out marching orders, the plea she issued three years ago on ""Much More Than That""-- ""please don’t take me lightly""-- quavers, crumples, turns to ash.</p>
<p>After the torching comes the slow, steady burn. ""Kevin's"" sounds like an <i>Epic</i> latecomer welcomed into<i> Tramp</i>'s fold, Van Etten’s voice, falling somewhere between Cass Elliot's range and Cat Power's emotional register, turns darker and resigned, the whole song one long smoky exhale. ""Leonard"" is a dreamy, abashed waltz; tickled by ukuleles and kicked along by a big bass drum; it reveals the album's lone confession that seems to stem from anything close to guilt. It's an admission that takes three go-rounds of the chorus to make itself fully known, Van Etten shuffling around the hard truth: ""I am bad""-- ""I am bad at loving""-- ""I am bad at loving you.""</p>
<p>The album's brightest spot comes with the steady, strummy ""We Are Fine"", in which Van Etten talks through a panic attack with a friend (""Take my hand and help me not to shake/ Say I'm all right, I'm all right""). <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/636-beirut/"" target=""_blank"">Beirut</a>'s Zach Condon sings harmonies and a verse of his own, the song written with him in mind, Van Etten <a href=""http://stereogum.com/923661/progress-report-sharon-van-etten/franchises/progress-report"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a>, not just because she first plucked it out on a ukulele, but because they both do battle with the gnarly beast of social anxiety. There's often no clear balm for Van Etten's laments, but ""We Are Fine"" is both the means and the end, the sickness and the cure in one.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Tramp</i> is maybe best thought of in terms of having a Side A and a Side B; otherwise, the middle section falls into a weird mid-album slough that doesn't quite jibe with Van Etten and Dessner's generally excellent sense of timing and space. Imagine a click, a pause and a careful flip between the fractured, meandering ""In Line"" and ""All I Can"", which starts with a mewling organ hum and gradually wills itself into blistering hugeness. That song might have worked, too, as a big closer; the seething ""Joke or a Lie"" serves better as a feint than a final attack. As it is, the album doesn't end so much as infinitely loop on itself (serpents, indeed), the last track's final scrape threading back into ""Warsaw""'s opening thump and clank.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""I want my scars to help and heal,"" Van Etten sings on ""All I Can"". That healing comes, in part, from the making of the music-- that act of physically locating the pain in some way that can be accessed and then shelved as life tumbles on. But it comes, too, from being pushed out into the world, to people who now say, ""Yes, we are here, and we are listening.""</p></div>"|16233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16233-tramp/|7.9|Rachael Maddux

I don't just mean the widescreen progressive house they made, two decades of which are collected on the 25 tracks of the new<i> Anthology</i>, but their brand of not-quite-trance/not-quite-techno floor-fillers were indeed self-consciously epic and transportive. Following the late-1980s acid-house revelation that turned so many UK synth-pop also-rans into DJ kings, Underworld came to specialize in the kind of dance music that felt constrained in a tiny club space, records with enough space and depth to lose yourself in the swirl and flow, whether you were standing in a festival field surrounded by thousands of other bodies or strapped into a pair of headphones on your lonesome.</p>
<p>Underworld had a live rock band's feel for pacing and drama, but were born-again house music evangelists, through and through. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_profilepage&amp;v=OUuV7nOWGM8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dark and Long (Dark Train)""</a> was the structuring principle for music of their peak music, as well as the title of one of their deepest, moodiest cuts. Despite Karl Hyde's nagging half-spoken and half-sung mantras, Underworld never really flirted with ""songwriting."" Though his fragmentary, pre-millennium tension babble could be equally silly, Hyde wasn't the grimacing focal point of Underworld, as the two MCs were in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3402-the-prodigy/"" target=""_blank"">the Prodigy</a>. Even when they were stars, taking to festival stages rather than DJ booths, Underworld never tried to be personalities, letting DJ culture continue to dictate the shape and force and presentation of their music. Unlike unrepentant hookmeister <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1463-fatboy-slim/"" target=""_blank"">Norman Cook</a>, Underworld also didn't go for big-stoopid-chorus and earworm-loop immediacy, even when forced to shave their singles down to broadcast length. They simply attempted to recreate the peaks-and-valleys of a club cut in miniature. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiMrrleH_hI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Born Slippy .NUXX""</a> may be more head-wrecking at its proper length, but the video version was like a hyper-condensed advert for the same effect, angelic intro giving way to massive hard house drums that are the song's real hook.</p>
<p>This dance essentialism disguised as crossover friendliness may have limited their appeal to pop fans once the ""electronica"" boom went pfft and many fair-weather compilation buyers realized they really didn't care for 12-minute instrumentals after all. But it makes Underworld ripe for rediscovery by a generation of new college kids who've dedicated themselves to recreating the 1990s house music they were barely alive for. After all, if you've got to go retro, go big. It's no surprise that <i>Anthology</i> collects these tracks at their full 12""-mix lengths, rather than their highlight reel-style radio edits. All the more for you to swim around in. And those peaks certainly take you higher when the builds have been teased out to the limit.</p>
<p>Plenty of DJs and producers have made ""huge"" dance records that nonetheless feel rather small as pop artifacts because they're aimed at insular subcultures. Several of Underworld's biggest records, in the musical sense of the word, were recorded and released when they were indeed club-circuit draw on the rise and a music press rumor to the wider world, especially in America. 1993's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0oMwKnU3OM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rez""</a>, which builds with the controlled grandeur of pre-cheesy continental trance but uses much of Detroit techno's sonic signature, would have been no one's idea of a chart smash. Its melodic hook is too abstract. Its repetitive structure is still aimed at all-night dancing rather than earworm immediacy. But the track's whole vibe is also too big to ignore, as if it's straining to some DJ's crates for a suburban pop-techno radio utopia that didn't yet exist. If so many of these singles still sound like world-flattening anthems today, more than a decade after Underworld's commercial peak, it's partially due to the overwhelming ambition the music still projects, the idea that through luck and timing and canny cross-media promotion and a kind of benign will-to-power, they could bring (mostly) instrumental electronic music to a mass audience.</p>
<p>They got their wish, though only many years into their career and after several failed attempts that have more or less been airbrushed from their official history. This most recent best-of collection is subtitled ""1992 to 2012"" because 20 years makes a respectable round number for official retrospection. But you'd be hard-pressed to claim their earliest albums, where the best you can say is that they pulled a half-decent sartorial imitation of Depeche Mode on the sleeve art, as part of the band's real legacy. Acid house's sweeping the UK in 1988 both freed them from silly pop preening and pointed out that their real strength was in stringing together adrenaline-pumping climaxes along spacious beatscapes. They had a good run, about as long as any of their peers, and the idyllic ambient house and blown-out filter disco sieved from 2002's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8350-a-hundred-days-off/"" target=""_blank"">A Hundred Days Off</a></i> for <i>Anthology</i> promised good things for how Underworld would weather the rapid trend-shifts of new millennium dance.</p>
<p>Then the great house contraction occurred, and suddenly Underworld (like so many of their peers) seemed massively out-of-step with the gaunt form dance hipness took with minimal. Almost a decade later, huge is back, in many forms, but what you hear now, with Underworld's particular brand of hugeness no longer the face of dance populism, is how it's the subtlety that keeps these anthems repeat-listenable, as much as the hands-aloft moments. Damned as dance music afflicted with gigantism when techno started starving itself of hooks, Underworld were masters of restraint, nuance, and pace compared to today's prole-friendly producers, such as Skrillex and Deadmau5. There's all the attention to detail of your average deep house bore, along with a lot of pleasing bombast and (it must be said) some pretty damn dodgy lyrics. Don't play them for any neon-clad goobers craving only the biggest bass drops, but if you're looking for a long and dark journey that eventually arrives at euphoria, you could still do a lot worse.</p></div>"|16234.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16234-the-anthology-1982-to-2012/|7.0|Jess Harvell

Of course he is: It's not like he's a second-chair French horn player for Arcade Fire, he's the lead guitarist of a relatively straightforward garage-rock quartet. Aside from being 25% of the band, his work is integral to the group's success: It's difficult imagining what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13507-grey-eyed-girls/"" target=""_blank"">""Grey-Eyed Girls""</a> would sound like without his rippling, jangly leads or ""August in My Mind"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14851-waterfall/"" target=""_blank"">""Waterfall""</a> minus his Morricone-in-a-punk-basement fretwork. But regardless of how essential he is to his group, being a guitarist is only one of many forms of musical expression, which is why many sidemen fiddle around with solo projects.</p>
<p>That said, <i>Earth Has Doors</i> feels like the diametric opposite of ""fiddling around."" The same could be said about his life. After writing these songs hunched over an eight-track four years ago, Miles shelved his solo work in favor of responsibilities familial (he has a child), professional (the Fresh &amp; Onlys are currently gearing up to release a new album, their fourth in the past 36 months), and intellectual (he has a degree in the humanities). The latter is clearly displayed on the EP, which has been presented as a rumination on the deep sense of existentialism that strikes many people approaching their thirties.</p>
<p>But instead of looking inside of himself and realizing his life is insignificant in the bigger picture, Miles faces the lens outward, touching on the initial allure and subsequent emptiness of drugs, the vapidity of consumer culture, and even the metaphysical. He's <a href=""http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/releases/sbr070/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained</a> what he was trying to accomplish: ""Sonically the mood had to reflect the somberness of moving between the existential chaos of my 20s into this new perspective of living... The mysterious hues of the soundscape reflect a sense of curiosity and possibility in the canyons of sound."" In laymen's terms, the EP quickly taps into 1960s and 1970s prog bluster, complete with song titles long enough to require commas.</p>
<p>The 12"" is split into two sides, and Side A is the more song-based of the two, with the soundscapes taking a backseat to two dramatic tunes. Its opener softly picks an acoustic guitar and before long, everything is blasted skyward and the song feels spacious and ominous at the same time, like a helicopter hovering over a field. ""Temples of Magick"" is miles heavier, using tiny bits of squall that squeal in the background. Miles sings in an incredibly wearied voice toward the end of the song, as the mood cascades from eerie to dramatic to back again.</p>
<p>Side B begins with ""As the Orchard is With Rain"", a floaty, melancholy instrumental, featuring the ambiance of gusty wind, guitar with rapid drop-of-a-dime tempo changes, and a few droning violins circling underneath the sound of thunder (aka a few noisy guitars). The final track ""Earth Has Doors, Let Them Open"" features vintage synths overwhelmingly high in the mix while Miles let's out a battle cry to open these proverbial doors, before the song breaks down into a agonizingly slow coda that, like much of the EP, feels longer than it actually is.</p>
<p>Really, with an EP so dramatic and high-concept, it's almost a wonder it came out of the Fresh &amp; Onlys camp. That's another thing about solo projects: It's like Miles felt the stakes for this were astronomically high, even if nobody else knew it.</p></div>"|16229.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16229-earth-has-doors/|7.1|Martin Douglas

The Oregonian songstress knows the power a few well-chosen words and clear images can carry-- all the better when complemented with an economy of instrumentation-- and she put this know-how to good use on her two previous solo outings, 2006's <i>If You Come to Greet Me</i> and 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12816-beasts-of-seasons/"" target=""_blank"">Beasts of Seasons</a></i>. Those records also benefited from their intimacy and frankness, both embodied in Gibson's voice. It's a gentle thing, wise but vulnerable, and it wraps itself around the vowels with a nasal quality that calls to mind the earliest decades of recorded music. That voice returns more versatile than before on <i>La Grande</i> (sorry Francophones, it rhymes with ""demand""), which finds Gibson shedding some of her characteristic simplicity, spreading her wings, and trying a few new musical styles on for size in the process.</p>
<p>A newfound momentum is evident from the moment the opening title track rolls in, all galloping drums, see-saw bass, dust-bowl guitars, and spectral moaning. It ain't exactly ""Rawhide"", but it's a more assertive move than we're used to from Gibson, whose previous records began quietly and gracefully. From there <i>La Grande</i> dips and sways, holes up and sprawls out again, not unlike the rugged terrain of the northeastern Oregon locale from which the album derives its name. Gibson's quiet moments are still her most striking: ""Crow/Swallow"" comes close to capturing the elegant melancholy of <i>Greet Me</i> standout ""Broken Bottle"", while on closing track ""Feather Lungs"" Gibson makes use of a cappella 1940s vocal-group harmonizations to soften the edges of a song plainly about final repose. However it's thanks to more upbeat tracks such as ""The Fire"", ""Skin, Warming Skin"", and the aforementioned opener that these more intimate offerings shine in contrast. This, perhaps, is a lesson learned from<i> Beasts</i>, where a stream of pared-down tracks on the record's latter half, while each affecting on its own, tended to smear together in succession.</p>
<p>New sounds of yore continue on ""Lion/Lamb"", with its bossa nova rhythm, and ""The Rushing Dark"", which drifts in and out like an old spiritual sung from a passing river barge. ""Skin"", easily the record's most momentous track, is, appropriately, also its sex jam: Lines about ""secrets... hidden in the hems of summer dresses"" and leaving ""seeds to break and swell"" alternate with a rousing wordless chorus of ""ooh-ooh-oohs"" while our narrator must keep reminding herself, ""it's only skin, warming skin, warming skin."" Meanwhile, the romance that may well have led to such skin-warming is given its due on ""Red Moon"", which has Gibson expressing her desire to ""drink up"" her lover's ""poetry"" on what sounds like a vintage microphone. This comes served over Latin-inflected guitar and a recurring sample of an old waltz record, all new looks for the usually more restrained Gibson.</p>
<p>Rather than another exercise in genre-dabbling and dilettantism, <i>La Grande</i> succeeds as a cohesive work thanks to the persistence of Gibson's vision. As a songwriter she's preoccupied with those timeless questions of the human condition, but seldom if ever stumbles into pretension or self-satisfaction. Themes of love, loss, regret, and mortality crop up often, and, significantly, they're well-served by the surrounding songcraft. One wouldn't expect Gibson's latest to bowl over any audiophile chasing the wow!-factor, but for the patient, contemplative listener, <i>La Grande</i>-- much like the campfire depicted on its cover-- is a record worth warming to.</p></div>"|16226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16226-la-grande/|7.4|Matthew Solarski

More specifically, an <i>American</i> dream fulfilled, rags turning to riches with the snap of a manicured finger, kissing James Dean in Gatsby's swimming pool, getting played on the radio. This is a central question animating <a href=""http://www.lanadelrey.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lana Del Rey</a>'s <i>Born to Die</i>. Our heroine has all the love, diamonds, and Diet Mountain Dew she could ask for, yet still sings, ""I wish I was dead,"" sounding utterly incapable of joy. To paraphrase Liz Phair, if you get everything you wish for and you're still unhappy, then you know that the problem is you.</p>
<p>Given the waves of hype and backlash over the last six months, it can be easy to forget that we're here, first and foremost, because of a song. ""Video Games"" struck a nerve not just because it was an introduction to Del Rey's captivating voice but because it seemed to suggest something as-yet-unarticulated about the way we live today. Whatever her intention, as a metaphor about disconnect and detachment from our own desires, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12276-video-games/"" target=""_blank"">""Video Games""</a> felt frank, pointed, and true, and it had a chord progression and melody to match. The ultimate disappointment of <i>Born to Die</i>, then, is how out of touch it feels not just with the world around it, but with the simple business of human emotion.</p>
<p>The singer born Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Grant may have made her mark with a grainy homemade video that brought to mind other grainy homemade videos in the indie sphere, but the slick sound and sentiment of ""Radio"", <i>Born to Die</i>'s most straightforward statement of purpose (""Baby love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio/ How do you like me now?""), places it firmly within the realm of big-budget chart pop. <i>Born to Die</i> was produced by Emile Haynie, whose credits include Eminem, Lil Wayne, and Kid Cudi, and the album's impressively lush atmosphere might be the one thing that will unite its detractors and apologists.</p>
<p>The album's recurring themes ooze out of every note: sex, drugs, and glitter hover in the yawning atmosphere around Del Rey's breathy vocals. There are strings and trip-hop beats and bits of 1950s twang, and the melodies, assembled with assistance from hired-gun songwriters like Mike Daly (Plain White Ts, Whiskeytown) and Rick Nowels (Belinda Carlisle's ""Heaven Is a Place on Earth"") are built to stick. But for an album that aims for fickle radio listeners, many of its pop signifiers feel stale and ill-fitting. On ""Million Dollar Man"", Del Rey drawls like a highly medicated Fiona Apple, and ""Diet Mountain Dew"" and ""Off to the Races"" aim for chatty, sparkling opulence, this singer doesn't have the personality to bring it off.</p>
<p>The album's point of view-- if you could call it that-- feels awkward and out of date. Whether you take a line like ""Money is the reason we exist/ Everybody knows that it's a fact/ Kiss kiss"" with a 10-carat grain of salt is up to you, but even as a jab at the chihuahua-in-Paris-Hilton's-handbag lifestyle, it feels limp and pointless (unlike, say, Lily Allen's mock-vapid but slyly observant 2008 single ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-wGMlSuX_c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Fear</a>""). Still, the dollar signs in its eyes aren't an inherent strike against <i>Born to Die</i>: Even in the wake of an international debt crisis and the Occupy movement, it was hard not to fall for <i>Watch the Throne</i>. But that's because Jay and Kanye made escapist fantasy sound so <i>fun</i>. Del Rey's gem-encrusted dreamworld, meanwhile, relies on clichés (""God you're so handsome/ Take me to the Hamptons"") rather than specific evocations. It's a fantasy world that makes you long for reality.</p>
<p>And speaking of fantasy: The conversation surrounding Lana Del Rey has underscored some seriously depressing truths about sexism in music. She was subjected to the kind of intense scrutiny-- about her backstory and especially her appearance-- that's generally reserved for women only. But the sexual politics of <i>Born to Die</i> are troubling too: You'd be hard pressed to find any song on which Del Rey reveals an interiority or figures herself as anything more complex than an ice-cream-cone-licking object of male desire (a line in <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12373-blue-jeans/"" target=""_blank"">""Blue Jeans""</a>, ""I will love you till the end of time/ I would wait a million years,"" sums up about 65% of the album's lyrical content). Even when Del Rey offers something that could be read as a critique (""This is what makes us girls/ We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first""), she asks that we make no effort to change, escape, or transcend the way things are (""Don't cry about it/ Don't cry about it."") In terms of its America-sized grandeur and its fixation with the emptiness of dreams, <i>Born to Die</i> attempts to serve as Del Rey's own beautiful, dark, twisted fantasy, but there's no spark and nothing at stake.</p>
<p>The critic Ellen Willis once wrote of Bette Midler: ""Blatant artifice can, in the right circumstances, be poignantly honest, and she expresses the tension between image and inner self that all of us-- but especially women-- experience."" But <i>Born to Die</i> never allows tension or complexity into the mix, and its take on female sexuality ends up feeling thoroughly tame. For all of its coos about love and devotion, it's the album equivalent of a faked orgasm-- a collection of torch songs with no fire.</p></div>"|16223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16223-lana-del-rey/|5.5|Lindsay Zoladz

On <i>Strange Weekend</i>, Porcelain Raft's debut full-length effort, Remiddi sounds like nothing if not a weary sojourner resigned to endlessly floating through the interstellar or spiritual cosmos. His forerunners in this respect are Marc Bolan, John Lennon, and David Bowie, performers who consistently sought some kind of transcendence of the corporeal, struggling to achieve earthly connections and understanding while chafing against the bounds of time and space.</p>
<p>Song titles like ""Drifting in and Out"", ""Shapeless &amp; Gone"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12720-put-me-to-sleep/"" target=""_blank"">""Put Me to Sleep""</a> give an excellent idea of what Remiddi has in store. Porcelain Raft borrows liberally from both the shoegaze and dream-pop playbooks, and so we get layers of sonic gauze shot through with delicately strummed acoustic guitar patterns and Remiddi's reedy, rather androgynous voice. In the spacey somnolence applied to venerable classic rock sounds and structures-- Lennon's most obviously on  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12963-unless-you-speak-from-your-heart/"" target=""_blank"">""Unless You Speak From Your Heart""</a>, Bolan's on ""Picture""-- Remiddi very much shares a kinship with Beach House. There's some of Porcelain Raft touring partner M83's elegant sweep here too, while the woozy, hypnotic beatscapes of ""Is It Deep Enough For You"" and ""If You Have a Wish"" aren't far removed at all from chillwavers like Neon Indian. Many of the melodies feel familiar but can't easily be precisely placed, which not only makes them good earworm candidates but also enhances the album's dreamlike, half-remembered feel.</p>
<p>The record's pervading sense of wistfulness and resignation extends to the lyrics-- they're often buried or abstracted, but occasionally something nakedly direct emerges, like the ingenuous sentiment conveyed in the title of ""Unless You Speak From Your Heart"", or, perhaps a bit more artfully, Remiddi's assertion in ""Backwords"" that ""I hope you're in a nice hotel/ Playing cards in your room/ With someone who cares over you.""</p>
<p>As you'd expect from such a bleary, atmospheric album, <i>Strange Weekend</i> hangs together well as a whole-cloth statement, though that doesn't mean there aren't standouts, particularly ""Backwords"", with its exhausted grandeur reminiscent of Pink Floyd, as well as the gorgeous ""Put Me to Sleep"", which seems tailor-made to soundtrack a scene where Carey Mulligan is sad in some major metropolitan city. Which is presumably a situation to which a well-traveled melancholic like Remiddi can readily relate.</p></div>"|16208.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16208-strange-weekend/|7.4|Josh Love

An hour-long, shifting soundscape sketched out with broken drum machines, meandering guitar picking, and hushed vocals, it was as if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28459-mount-kimbie/"" target=""_blank"">Mount Kimbie</a> were let loose in the wilderness of Southern California, all scorching sun and and dried, burned landscapes. The soft and pseudo-naturalistic direction was a sharp left-turn for Henry Laufer, who had mostly made synth- and sample-heavy takes on distorted hip-hop before then. He continues down that moss-grown path with the <i>Vacation</i> EP, a more focused and confident take on <i>Bad Vibes</i>' landscape paintings.</p>
<p>Opener ""The Way U Do"" is firmly in the Shlohmo style: dripping water, those familiar percussive rimshots (taken far outside their house music context), and a slippery sense of time, as if Laufer can't help but let his beats slide out of order every single bar. But the song's strengths lie in its melody: Pairing a distorted riff with an extended vocal sample, Laufer plays a sort of virtuoso conductor with his faceless vocalist, stretching out melisma into twirling, elongated lines and elegant loops, distorting it so it sounds fluid and constant like a guitar solo. Mixed in with the dragging-feet bassline and moping percussion, the emphasis here is on searing pain and heart-tugging emotion, nicely expanding on <i>Bad Vibes</i>' often detached prettiness.</p>
<p>The meek and plaintive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12951-wen-wuu/"" target=""_blank"">""wen uuu""</a> further ratchets up the percussion, but this time it's a bumpy zig-zag of makeshift drums leaving just enough room for a different kind of vocal sampling. Chopping up vocal syllables into fine pieces, the song finds its own beauty in a synchronized jerky stutter, occasionally climaxing in those sublime moments of beauty (the titular ""when you"" vocal) that mark the best of Shlohmo's recent work. ""Rained the Whole Time"" rounds things off a little more business-as-usual, a <i>Bad Vibes</i> holdover of bluesy guitar rubbing against knotted basslines and rattling drums.</p>
<p><i>Vacation</i> is an ideal stop-gap EP, taking the sound of the album it follows and tightening it up just a little bit, closing the story as it were on <i>Bad Vibes</i>' holistic journey. You won't find a gentler, more ruminative take on <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a>-style beats anywhere, and for someone whose work used to sound charmingly homemade, the processing mastery here is impressive. The EP packs a lot of power into a mere three tracks.</p></div>"|16219.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16219-vacation/|7.5|Andrew Ryce

""We have huge respect for the pioneers of house music and nightclubbing-- some of them were gay,"" Rundell, aka DJ Raf Daddy, said an <a href=""http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/8832/1/joe-goddard-raf-daddy-make-2-bears"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>. Based on that description, you might expect hands-in-the-air club sounds from this project (and there is some of that) but <i>Be Strong</i> is primarily about pop-- the kind that is gooey, uplifting, and occasionally goofy.</p>
<p>The thing that stands out immediately (and is immediately likable) about the record is just how earnest these guys are about their optimism. The quotes ""Love is lovely"" and ""war is ugly"" show up on the album and its sleeve, and nearly every track details some kind of fondness-- of a partner, of a band, of a friend or just someone you bumped into on the dancefloor. (Seems like the Care Bears could have also worked as a band name, and in fact the furry gang appears in the video for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Mno22eVks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Church""</a>.) This heart-on-sleeve emoting is something Goddard and co. did very well on Hot Chip's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13908-one-life-stand/"" target=""_blank""><i>One Life Stand</i></a>, and it works here much the same way it did on tracks such as ""Brothers"": simple sentiments expressed simply over music that buoys the sweet parts and gives weight to the more serious stretches.</p>
<p>If <i>Be Strong</i> is all about adoration, the biggest recipient of it is music itself. On these songs, Rundell and Goddard rep and rework lots of their personal favorites. One track is called ""Heart of the Congos"", for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_the_Congos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">classic reggae LP</a> of the same name, and artists such as Kraftwerk, Wiley, Hot City, and Steely Dan all get shoutouts along the way. This is definitely what Simon Reynolds would call ""record-collector rock,"" and I'm generally with him about the pitfalls of artists' constantly looking backwards, but these guys pull it off. For one, they tend to be futurist in their nostalgia, able to not just reinterpret but recontextualize things like rave or Chicago house. Also, there's a fan-like purity in the way they sing about the stuff-- you can tell how much it means to them.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that <i>Be Strong</i> occasionally veers into silly territory to the extent that you can't really forget it's a side project. There are tracks, like ""Bear Hug"", sort of a twerked-up <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj9_yW8tZxs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Humpty Dance""</a> (key line: ""All you out there on the floor, gonna get you in my paws and give you a bear hug""), that would definitely not make the final cut of a Hot Chip album. But the guys' commitment to music-as-fun and big, croon-y hooks (Goddard's velvet vocals sound as good as ever here) keeps it enjoyable throughout. The key, though, is that Goddard and Rundell set out to make something sentimental and happy-sounding and never bothered to worry if it seemed cool or not to do so. A relatively low-stakes project, sure, but for a small album, it's got a big heart.</p></div>"|16224.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16224-be-strong/|7.3|Joe Colly

With a handful of major and minor hits and recent placements on albums by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16140-thug-motivation-103-hustlerz-ambition/"" target=""_blank"">Young Jeezy</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16172-rich-forever/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>, Future has a major-label debut somewhere on the horizon, but the album will undoubtedly languish if he can't keep his momentum going. <i>Astronaut Status </i>is his first big move of the year, and though the tape doesn't really bring much of anything new to the table, it is Future's strongest, most listenable mixtape yet, and that alone is notable enough.</p>
<p>As much as any of his mixtapes, <i>Astronaut Status</i> puts Future's talents as a songwriter at the forefront. There's nothing here that's elaborate or notably deep, and in fact Future trades on his ability to write quirky, catchy little songs that you could easily picture as playground chants. There is an inclination in the rap world to tag songs likes these as disposable, but the ruthless efficiency in Future's writing makes these tracks endure, even if it's in your head and against your will. There's a circular, almost music-box quality to tracks like ""Nunbout"" and ""Swap it Out"", with Future driving the same idea and melody into the ground, that gives them an organic, homespun feel. It wouldn't be a stretch to imagine these songs as one-takes, or not being built up much further from demos, but sometimes melodies are indelible enough that they don't really need much more than that. The playground element of the songs is important-- plenty of rap songs have liberally interpolated actual playground classics, though Future's ability to mine the space between seriousness and something close to childish taunting is unique.</p>
<p>Future has said in interviews that he wants to make stadium music, and though that's enough of a jump in ambition that it could lead him down a disastrous path, he does succeed on <i>Astronaut Status </i>when he widens his scope or pushes himself vocally. The obvious standout in this regard is ""Deeper Than the Ocean"", a track with Spanish guitars and a squealing solo that finds Future singing in a cracked, raspy voice about the pain in his life. The sentiment is real and the lyrics a bit jarring, even if the execution is slightly ridiculous-- but it would only be a small leap of faith to close your eyes and imagine Future as Adele performing ""Someone Like You"" at the Brit Awards. Elsewhere, ""Spaz on Y'all"" and ""Birds Take a Bath"" are more conventionally anthemic, but nonetheless show that Future is capable of picking off where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7171-akon/"" target=""_blank"">Akon</a> left off, which I promise is more important than it sounds.</p>
<p>Future could likely go on like this forever, prolifically releasing mixtapes with more than enough good songs to justify their existence. At some point, he will need to strike gold again, and in the murky waters of pop-rap hitmaking, it's hard to tell if anything on <i>Astronaut Status</i> stands up to the songs that helped Future ascend to this status in the first place. Until all of that shakes out, though, we can do just fine enjoying his catchy, goofy songs as they are.</p></div>"|16217.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16217-astronaut-status/|7.1|Jordan Sargent

His second full-length statement,<i> Habits &amp; Contradictions</i>, is a sumptuously produced and deeply enjoyable hour-plus slab of weed-clouded rap, but it's more than that. I've spent the past four days immersed in it, trying to resolve its conflicting impulses and ferret out all of its weird corners, and the only thing I can say for certain is that, while listening to it, I feel pulled completely into someone else's center of gravity, which is maybe the most gratifying listener's sensation there is.</p>
<p>The record's first layer is sheer sound: <i>Habits &amp; Contradictions</i> is full of plush, inviting, high-thread-count production, the kind that pulls you toward fat headphones and a chair. Like Kendrick Lamar's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15653-section80/"" target=""_blank"">Section.80</a></i>, there is a woozy drag to the drums and a thick, clotted feel to the sounds surrounding them. It shares a metabolic rate with Houston screw music, but the album's chilly mood is closer to the heron'-gray-skies gloom of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"" target=""_blank"">RZA</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4755-mobb-deep/"" target=""_blank"">Mobb Deep</a>. In fact, when <span style=""color: #222222; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969);"">Mobb Deep affiliate</span> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6765-the-alchemist/"" target=""_blank"">the Alchemist</a> shows up halfway through <i>Habits</i> on ""My Homie"", he feels right at home.</p>
<p><i>Habits &amp; Contradictions</i> is, accordingly, a dark and moody listen, but it never bogs down in momentum or succumbs to despair. ""There He Go"" flips a sample of Portland trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2892-menomena/"" target=""_blank"">Menomena</a>'s brittle <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iqg3LVx2Ws"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wet and Rusting""</a> into a hard-hitting anthem. ""Druggys Wit Hoes Again"", with its gabbling bursts of vocal samples and bone-jarring snare kicks, is a prime slab of Bay Area gangsta music. Even when everything slows to a crawl, there are small sounds tucked in everywhere, enlivening the darkness: the spaghetti-western guitar twangs on ""Sacrilegious"", or the heavy-breathing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"" target=""_blank"">Portishead</a> drum break of ""Raymond 1969"".</p>
<p>It helps that Schoolboy is an odd, genuinely unpredictable presence who sometimes seems to be rapping entirely for his own amusement. There's audible dryness in his voice as he drunkenly croons the off-key hook, ""House fulla money/ Tub fulla bitches,"" on ""How We Feeling"", and you can hear he's holding the words in air quotes, as if he's just trying the words on, since they're the Sorts of Things One Says in Rap Songs. On ""Nightmare on Fig St."", he teases the opening ""Ball so hard"" bars of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12613-niggas-in-paris-remix-ft-ti/"" target=""_blank"">""Niggas in Paris""</a> for no obvious reason, and then launches into sharply worded threats (""The landlord, turn your lieutenant into a tenant""), head-turning non sequiturs (""We drive to pussy more than we do to church/ No AC but the heater WOOOORK!"") and a riot of demented ad-libs.</p>
<p>This lily-pad hopping means that it takes a while for the buried emotion in <i>Habits</i> to surface. Schoolboy raps in a wearily flat voice that evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30073-prodigy/"" target=""_blank"">Prodigy</a>'s, and his lyrics deal with all the dark stuff of gangsta rap: poverty, violence, drugs, hopelessness. But his music has none of gangsta rap's implacable, survival-at-all-costs forward motion. Schoolboy's music is dank with the lousy weather of disappointment, with human-sized failures. When he tells us about selling oxycontin with a lifelong friend who sold him out, he doesn't sound like murderous Vengeance Incarnate; he just sounds hurt. His tangled past as a set leader of the Hoover Crips, meanwhile, leaks out in small bits. ""Contradictions in my thoughts, and I just execute my feelings,"" he mutters on ""2 Raw"", and it hints effectively at an unspoken well of remorse.</p>
<p>Schoolboy Q has little of Black Hippy alpha Kendrick Lamar's gloomy-paladin aura, or his rap-Hamlet charisma. But it's worth noting that, at least right now, Schoolboy is making stronger music than Kendrick. <i>Habits &amp; Contradictions</i> sounds comfortable in its skin, at home its own quiet strangeness, in a way that <i>Section.80</i> never manages. It's better-paced. He's probably not going to be a break-out star, but it's hard to imagine that there will be many more original or satisfying rap long-players this year.</p></div>"|16216.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16216-schoolboy-q-habits-contradictions/|8.4|Jayson Greene

It reached listeners with only a passing interest in music from the experimental sphere, much in the manner of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/302-william-basinski/"" target=""_blank"">William Basinski</a>'s early-millennium series <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/577-the-disintegration-loops-i-iv/"" target=""_blank"">Disintegration Loops</a></i>, because it brought together ideas about archives, appropriation, memory, and the accretion and disappearance of cultural objects. The name of Kirby's project comes from Jack Nicholson's character in <i>The Shining</i>, and <i>Bliss</i> was the album as a large, empty, and haunted building, imparting a feeling of loneliness at the edge of the world. Sampling and manipulating crackling 78s with sweet dance tunes from the 1920s and 1930s, Kirby's tracks dangled in front of you and turned slowly, rods on a mobile that was gradually falling apart.</p>
<p>Following a solo album, <i>Eager to Tear Apart the Stars</i>, that was nearly as fine, Kirby returns with a new Caretaker record, this one the soundtrack to a film by director Grant Gee about the German writer W.G. Sebald. According to Kirby, this material was actually recorded before <i>Bliss</i>, and <i>Patience (After Sebald)</i> is clearly the product of a similar process, though the record's overall mood is quite different. Instead of haunted jazz-age ballroom numbers, <i>Patience</i> draws from the music of Austrian composer Franz Schubert, sampling and manipulating (in some cases, very heavily) 78 recordings of his piece <i>Winterreise</i>. From its title on down, the Schubert piece brings to mind a frozen world, and Kirby responds in kind, crafting an album that hints at the season's chill with characteristic complexity and ambiguity.</p>
<p>Given the nature of its source, Patience is mostly built from manipulated samples of piano and voice. ""When the Dog Days Were Drawing to an End"" loops a single keyboard fragment from a waltz-time section and punctuates the end of each cycle with a barely perceptible voice, and lets the melody, saturated with noise, spin in place for nearly five minutes. ""The Homesickness That Was Corroding Her Soul"" uses a warbly piano interlude for its repeated refrain, with the instability of the pitch imparting a sense of unease and tension. On the opener ""Everything Is on the Point of Decline"", hiss and rumble is pushed way out in front, so you can just barely make out the music beneath a blinding sheet of distortion. These are simple motifs, but they show an uncanny sense of balance and feel anything but accidental.</p>
<p>But the album grows more interesting in its second half, as the processing gradually overtakes the source material and transformation becomes the prevailing theme. ""In the Deep and Dark Hours of the Night"" coats the piano line in a thick syrup of slap-back echo and layers it under a piercing layer of hiss, making the music feel simultaneously distant and close, like it's either coming from inside your head or is so far away you can barely make it out. ""No One Knows What Shadowy Memories Haunt Them to This Day"" and the closing ""Now the Night is Over and the Dawn Is About to Break"" takes the guttural male vocals from Schubert's piece and stretches them out, turning single syllables into tense, uneasy drones. The effect, oddly, will remind some of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QspuCt1FM9M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Justin Bieber slowdown</a> from a while back, which sounded like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank"">Sigur Rós</a> being pulled through a black hole's event horizon. Kirby's voices, heard late in the record after the unsettling beauty of the piano loops, reinforce the feeling of collapsing into something, the howls, that could stand in for pain or ecstasy, suggest that something will never be the same.</p>
<p>The brilliant thing about the Caretaker project is how it mashes together emotional states into something complex that can sound different each time you hear it. While the surface hiss and 78-groove crackle, which are sometimes so loud they overwhelm the music the grooves carry inside them, bring to mind decay and death. The immersive, womb-like nature of Kirby's approach also conjures childhood and a life stretched in front of you, filled with possibility. So this music, so basic on one level, is both warm and cold, blackened by mortality and twinkling with life, somehow evoking the wonder and absurdity of existence itself.</p></div>"|16220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16220-patience-after-sebald/|8.0|Mark Richardson

Especially if you're into rockers in the tradition of <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/5450-baroness/"" target=""_blank"">Baroness</a> or <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5142-remission/"" target=""_blank"">Remission</a></i>-era <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/2699-mastodon/"" target=""_blank"">Mastodon</a>. Unlike the more recent versions of those older groups, Rising aren't into ""experimentation."" <i>To Solemn Ash</i>, their 10-song debut, offers straightforward metal that may come laced with the occasional acoustic interlude, but could definitely be reproduced in the smallest, shittiest club in the world without the help of guest musicians, triggers, a psychedelic choir, or a laptop. (The collection, released across Europe in October, saw its American release earlier this month.)</p>
<p>They've found multiple ways to come off expansive and compelling within a tight, traditional framework. In fact, <i>To Solemn Ash</i> goes places a 2009 EP and even a 2010 single couldn't without sounding too much different from either of the earlier efforts. Rising are ramping things up here, and honing a specific style, all without stepping outside of well-worn genre lines.</p>
<p>The sequencing helps. Immediately likable opening track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12924-mausoleum/"">""Mausoleum""</a> and ""Sea of Basalt"", the song that follows it, find bellowing vocalist/bassist Henrik Hald, guitarist/backup vocalist Jacob Krogholt, and drummer Jacob Johansen (the one new addition after their last recording) firing on all cylinders: ""Mausoleum""'s dynamics feel like tectonic shifts, and remain immensely hummable; ""Basalt"" finds them nodding at <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/10043-kylesa/"" target=""_blank"">Kylesa</a> with gruff multi-tracked vocal shouts and instrumentation that continually ebbs, crests, and regains momentum until the final bit of feedback. (Which raises a question: How do three dudes from Denmark sound so much like four or five folks from Georgia?)</p>
<p>Rising don't maintain this focus for 48 minutes, but there are plenty of ""wow"" moments like the six-minute <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/"" target=""_blank"">Torche</a>-meets-<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/3105-neurosis/"" target=""_blank"">Neurosis</a> of the mid-tempo ""ballads"" ""Cohorts Rise"" and ""Under Callous Wings"", the frantic <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"" target=""_blank"">Converge</a>-like riffing on the album's shortest track ""Through the Eyes of Catalysis"", and the way you feel like you can suddenly imagine <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/1943-high-on-fire/"" target=""_blank"">High on Fire</a> as a (very powerful) pop band while listening to ""Heir to the Flames"".</p>
<p>The trio isn't afraid to groove or veer into somewhat poppier territory, and can pull it off without sacrificing heaviness or getting too cute: They simply know how to write great riffs, and newbie producer Jakob Reichert Nielsen should probably be giving tutorials to ""star"" recordists who don't yet know how to make metal sound huge, polished, and just-raw-enough in their more renowned studios. It's worth repeating: For all the quality, head nods, and goosebumps this album provides, Rising are, more or less, a basic sludge-metal band. And it's refreshing not having to also pull out the words ""post"" or ""avant"" to describe them.</p></div>"|16214.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16214-to-solemn-ash/|7.6|Brandon Stosuy

What's remarkable about that album is how cut adrift from the world it feels, with the London-based Iranian musician dragging a series of collaborators into a musical bubble that still now, some 14 years later, feels like a singular transmission from a unique talent. Much of it is eerily prescient; the curdled funk riff and stomach-churning lethargy of ""Don't Fall Asleep"" mirrors the kind of feeling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a> have been dabbling in at the start of this decade. But, as is the case with many debut albums that set such a high bar, providing a second and third act for the stylistically assertive <i>Like Weather</i> proved problematic. On <i>U&amp;I </i>she's taken a different tack, dumping the celebrity collaborators (Terry Hall, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4347-martina-topley-bird/"">Martina Topley-Bird</a>) of her 2008 record, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12270-blood-looms-and-blooms/"">Blood, Looms and Blooms</a></i>, and even parting company with longtime singer Luca Santucci.</p>
<p>Instead, this album finds her working with the Berlin-based American DJ and musician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28527-mt-sims/"">Mt. Sims</a>, who provides the only vocal contributions to <i>U&amp;I</i>. There have been other changes, too. The scanty arrangements of yore, filled with crooked corners and dark cracks, have mostly been papered over. In their place comes a series of tracks that contain the most straightforward music Leila has produced to date, with vast strips of pulverizing industrial noise providing the combative spine that contorts awkwardly through this record. Even when she slows things down on <i>U&amp;I</i>, there's a palpable feeling of ugliness; ""In Consideration"" is pitched somewhere between uneasy operatic trills and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle</a>-style discord; ""In Motion Slow"" contains the same kind of collapse-of-utopia glassiness as early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> tracks such as ""Heliosphan"" and ""Hedphelym"".</p>
<p>In a sense, that's the biggest flaw with <i>U&amp;I</i>-- it's too easy to feel out where Leila has been sourcing this material. Whereas before she was operating in a peculiar vacuum, now it feels like she's breathing in the same air as the rest of us. Some of the emotion has dissipated as well-- there's nothing as beautifully forlorn as the Donna Paul-sung <i>Like Weather</i> cut ""Feeling"" here. Instead, we get the end-of-the-world blood rush of instrumental tracks ""Activate I"" and ""Eight"", which butt up against the Mt. Sims-fronted material. The latter is often undercut by gnarled bass synth work, sometimes to stirring effect (""All of This"") and at other times edging toward the pop-nihilism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">Nine Inch Nails</a> circa-""Head Like a Hole"" (""Welcome To Your Life""). It's only when the darkness is vanquished, such as on the zesty ""(Disappointed Cloud) Anyway"" and the spidery echo of the title track, that it feels like the pair is gelling.</p>
<p>There isn't a singular focus to any of Leila's albums-- she works best when she seems to be confounding herself with her own ideas, all cooked up by indulging unlikely impulses and allowing a series of collaborators to make an imprint on her work. Strangely, pairing with just Mt. Sims on <i>U&amp;I</i> appears to have resulted in less-focused output, with the duo gradually circling a grimy musical plughole, only managing to pull themselves out via less cluttered material in the back half of the record. It's the mystery and wonder of prior Leila albums that are diluted here. The sense of anatomizing her work and not being able to figure out why it all slots together so perfectly dissipates dramatically when you're being bludgeoned by the stentorian howl of ""Welcome to Your Life"". It's unlikely Leila will take a backward step from here, as she clearly never has in the past. But she could do a lot worse than digging out Luca Santucci's phone number next time out.</p></div>"|16218.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16218-ui/|6.2|Nick Neyland

The coke-chic irony, the automatic equation of wah-wah guitar with mustachioed porno kitsch, the focus on caricaturized libido at the expense of the chops of the singers who gave voice to it-- that all has to go. The alt/indie sphere did its best to work through those issues via stage-winking outlets like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1886-har-mar-superstar/"" target=""_blank"">Har Mar Superstar</a> and <i>Midnite Vultures</i>, but they were still steps towards an ability to approach the influence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Jackson</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5826-hall-and-oates/"" target=""_blank"">Hall and Oates</a> without requiring 15 layers of self-conscious distancing.</p>
<p>Yet to pull it off, you need to remember that old joke about how important sincerity is: Once you learn to fake it, the rest is easy. For Evan Voytas-- a Los Angeles multi-instrumentalist singer who sounds like he had to wade his way through Beck's ""Debra"" to get to Prince's ""The Beautiful Ones""-- that kind of commitment seems completely out of his grasp. The question of whether someone <i>really means it</i> when an artist dredges up old sounds isn't going away anytime soon, and after a couple of EPs and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICfvWD3W-T0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an abysmal, shrill-yet-affectless cover of ""Nothing Compares 2 U""</a>, it's the only question left to ask about Voytas' music. His latest EP, <i>Feel Me</i>, drops as a short but grueling tour of some of the most cloying, feeble soul-without-soul to dribble lamely out of wherever. The Playskool pop-funk that Voytas mistakes for peak Jam/Lewis is sickly enough: It stumbles around to hit a few loosely modernized, synth-driven takes on half-remembered Hi Records backbeats (""When We Could All Float Away""), L.A. Doobies/Dan studio rock cut with baking powder (""You Don't Even Know Where It's At""), and perfunctory boogie funk with all the propulsive energy of a Casio preset (""Can't Let Anybody Know Who You Are""). There's actually a recurring melodic shrug in the title track that stops two notes short of the stereotypical faux-Chinese riff that Carl Douglas used for ""Kung Fu Fighting"". Sir Nose lives.</p>
<p>But the problem above everything else is his voice-- you can't get around it, under it, or away from it, much less into it. At its most innocuous, there's a sort of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28430-owl-city/"" target=""_blank"">Owl City</a> twerpiness to it, a softbatch indifference trying to pass for mysterious shyness. But he also leans toward a high wail so shrill-- imagine Barry Gibb as Jon Lovitz's <a href=""http://www.hulu.com/watch/278921/saturday-night-live-jon-lovitz-as-annoying-man"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Annoying Man""</a>-- that any potential sincerity comes across as a desperate affectation. It's drenched in this grating nasal sibilance that sounds like an eye-rolling whine no matter what the message is. And there's a noncommittal emptiness to all that pitched-up whimpering-- loosely reflected in the deep-as-their-titles themes of songs such as ""When We Could All Float Away"", ""The Weightlessness"", and ""Can't Let Anybody Know Who You Are""-- that makes it impossible to catch on to any real drive or desire. You can't feel something that doesn't feel anything.</p></div>"|16215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16215-evan-voytas-feel-me/|3.3|Nate Patrin

The scene was set for all the makings of great agit-prop theater: two stone-faced women smacking the living shit out of crash cymbals, crazed instrument swapping, and not to mention an actual Michael Jackson impersonator showing up to bust some time-honored moves during the noisy coda. It was like Andy Kaufman had he been raised on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illmatic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Illmatic</i></a> and cable TV: Das Racist's secret strength is that you're never quite sure whether they're laughing with you or at you, but when they are at their best, their wise-ass approach also feels inclusive. The ""Conan"" appearance, however, was anything but welcoming. Heems (Himanshu Suri) and Kool A.D. (Victor Vasquez) mumbled through their verses, leaving the sloppy music to do the heavy lifting. Which made some sense, considering the record they were promoting was built to polarize. The paranoid <i>Relax</i> felt like a warning shot, a suggestion that maybe we'd all gotten a bit too close.</p>
<p>And now we have two of three promised mixtapes from the DR camp, Heems' <i>Nehru Jackets</i> and Kool A.D.'s <i>The Palm Wine Drinkard</i> (hype-man extraordinaire Dapwell's bid is up next.) While both lack the accessibility that marked the first two Das Racist tapes, they allow the rappers to indulge their most far-out ideas. Heems and Kool A.D. sound like they don't care what anyone thinks, and the accompanying freedom brings back some of that early charm. Though the approaches are notably different-- with <i>Nehru Jackets</i> sticking closer to the Das Racist script and <i>Palm Wine Drinkard</i> spending most of its time in the deep end-- the tapes are filled with unexpected payoffs.</p>
<p>If there was any question as to whether Kool A.D. was the true freak of the group, the first few minuts of <i>The Palm Wine Drinkard</i> lay it to rest. The opening track-- featuring the full seven minutes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/"" target=""_blank"">Outkast</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXmqauitBkM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Spottieottiedopaliscious""</a> instrumental, junked up with what sounds like the din of a busy high school woodshop laid over top-- is annoying and offputting, but things get better. It could have skated by on the easy charms of stuff like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPMJRA9HAFM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lagrimas Blancas""</a> (a funky chest-beater that finds A.D. cooling out by the pool in Barcelona, with an appropriate new mantra to match: ""Bitch, I'm James Murphy""), or the ass-shakingly friendly remixes of DR's ""You Can Sell Anything"" and ""Booty in the Air"". But when A.D. really stretches himself, some of the most bizarre ideas turn into something interesting. Most notable are the three post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> R&amp;B tracks, presented free of smugness or irony: The cottony, seductive ""Ganglion of Lightnings""-- a 2008 track from A.D.'s Wesleyan group <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Crisis"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Boy Crisis</a>, repurposed here-- is both sincere and intimate, conjuring a fluid dreaminess that feels sincere.

<p>Followers of Das Racist (or <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/himanshu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heems' Twitter</a> feed, for that matter) know that racial and socio-economic topics are always close at hand, but <i>Nehru Jackets</i> is not an overtly political record.

<p>But <i>Nehru Jackets</i> as a whole is pretty loose, filled with free-associative raps that find Heems in various states of alertness, sobriety, and engagement. It's also way too long.

In this setting, Heems is at his best when surrounded by better rappers, when he's able to mirror their enthusiasm and energy. If these two mixtapes prove anything, it's that these guys need each other.</p></div>"|16199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16199-heems-nehru-jackets-kool-ad-the-palm-wine-drinkard/|6.5|Zach Kelly

In this setting, Heems is at his best when surrounded by better rappers, when he's able to mirror their enthusiasm and energy. If these two mixtapes prove anything, it's that these guys need each other.</p></div>"|16199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16199-heems-nehru-jackets-kool-ad-the-palm-wine-drinkard/|6.2|Zach Kelly

Half the tracks on her band <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/hospitalitylives"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hospitality</a>'s self-titled debut LP make mention of these things, either their presence or, more significantly, their absence. Take ""Liberal Arts"", an appropriately languid tribute to mapless post-graduate ennui: ""So you found the lock/ But not the key that college brings/ And all the trouble of your B.A. in English literature/ Instead of law, or something more practical,"" Papini wryly surmises over a tamped-down electric riff and shuffly drums, showing her hand as the most promising recent graduate of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/662-camera-obscura/"" target=""_blank"">Tracyanne Campbell</a> school of cardigan rock. (In non-metaphorical reality, Papini studied at Yale.)</p>
<p>Then there's the dreamy, rootless ""Sleepover"": ""Lock the door, I'll take your coat/ Let's pretend that it's summer,"" she implores some itinerant lover, though the demand quickly slides into ""let's pretend that we're married"" and then, after a niggling guitar worms through the backdrop of brushy drums and gauzy harmonies, perhaps unsurprisingly dissolves: ""Lock the door before you leave.""</p>
<p>This album is about the comings and goings that can consume a certain kind of twentysomething's life, about fuguing and settling and sometimes not being able to tell one from the other. This album is also very fun, perhaps because, as Papini has wandered into her 30s, she seems to have realized that none of that really goes away, it just gets easier, or at least starts to seem bearably silly. In these songs, quietly groovy drumbeats turn fully danceable in the flick of an instant, shimmering Afropoppy guitar rains down like confetti, whole brass sections seem to barge in and sneak away and climb back in through some window.</p>
<p>The NYC-based trio recorded the album almost a year ago, then shopped it around and signed with Merge last fall. Some of the tracks (Papini wrote all of them; she plays piano and guitar, too) were re-recorded from their sparse 2008 EP, produced by Karl Blau, which was also called <i>Hospitality</i>. The LP was produced by the band's guitarist/drummer/keyboardist Nathan Michel (he and Papini are married) and Shane Stoneback, who's had his hand in the honeypots of Vampire Weekend, Sleigh Bells, and Cults.</p>
<p>The not-new songs here don't sound reworked so much as run through some kind of cartoony scrubbing contraption, Wonka Wash-style, emerging stunningly clean out the other end, the curvy surfaces all gleaming in the sun. ""Betty Wang"", apparently a tribute to one of Papini's old day-job colleagues, has been especially improved. The original sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom under the lingering threat of whinging roommates, with frumpy drums and Papini fighting back a yawn; now there's a brash, almost bratty energy, Papini hamming it up on the rollercoasting, ""If you leave New York/ I don't care, I don't care!"" line in particular, teased by real live electric guitars, trotting drums, twinkling keyboards. What's lost is Papini's raw vulnerability and delicate guitar-work (""Half an Apple"", one of the EP tracks not carried over here, built around her meandering vocals and spare finger-picking, has more than a bit of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9602-laura-marling/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Marling</a> vibe).</p>
<p>Papini's voice is funny-- kind of a knowingly prim brogue, one that would seem painfully affected if it wasn't so clear she's in on the vamping. As the press-packet story goes, she taught herself to sing growing up in Kansas City, Mo., via repeated listenings of the Psychedelic Furs' <i>Talk Talk Talk</i>. But that doesn't quite explain the darling strangeness of her voice, its sweet, rubbery petulance. It sounds more like she's channeling Hayley Mills duetting with Hayley Mills on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxtyAC59AeE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Let's Get Together""</a>, that song from <i>The Parent Trap</i>, the 1961 Disney movie in which Mills stars as teenage twins, separated at birth but reunited at summer camp, trying to trick their divorced parents into getting remarried. This preposterous plan at one point involves a musical number, the British Mills singing on one side as a West Coast tomboy, struggling to make sense of all the r's, and on the other as a clipped Boston debutante with a Mid-Atlantic lilt. Papini's voice falls somewhere in the funny middle space between the sisters' harmonies, whatever Midwestern drawl she might be shoving aside yearning from the wings, hand in hand with Mills' Londoner tendencies; she even punctuates a few of her own lines with a prodding ""yeah, yeah!"" that almost precisely echos the entirely unsubtle ""Let's Get Together"" refrain. All Mills got out of the song was a No. 8 Billboard hit and a politely-ignored novelty LP. By all accounts, Hospitality should fare a bit better.</p></div>"|16213.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16213-hospitality/|7.4|Rachael Maddux

After all, these affable Minnesotans offer the sort of spry and strummy ""no bullshit"" rock music that made tons of folks spring for the more expensive and less tastefully covered version of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7537-is-this-it/"" target=""_blank"">Is This It</a></i> more than 10 years ago.  That Howler's transformation from local faves to darlings of the international music press was aided by favorable write-ups in both <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>NME</i>, as well as the breathless, semi-mythic pursuit of Rough Trade Records-- the storied UK label reportedly flew overseas to sign the band based on its unsolicited demo-- only help strengthen the spiritual bond between these two groups.</p>
<p>It also helps (or hurts) that Howler frontman Jordan Gatesmith often offers his thoughts about love and loneliness in the same sort of laconic faux-macho groan that Julian Casablancas should've trademarked.  But while Gatesmith, at the ripe age of 19, isn't much younger than Casablancas was when the ink dried on the Strokes' first contract, he's not nearly as comfortable striking the same disaffected poses.  If anything, Howler suffer the more Gatesmith resembles Casablancas, partially because he's not pitching the same kind of game.  Howler's hearts are firmly affixed on their sleeves, right below a magic-marker version of the Weezer ""flying W.""  When Gatesmith's yawp collides with Howler's more sensitive sentiments-- for example, his shirt-rending complaints about necking on ""Wailing (Making Out)""-- it's not a good look.  Howler are better off when Gatesmith veers towards flattering another New York City music icon, Joey Ramone (as on ""This One's Different""), or simply making sure that he doesn't get too excited.</p>
<p>At this point in their ridiculously young career, though, Howler's best look is when Gatesmith isn't on the mic.  As mentioned, Howler have got a little Strokes in their music as well, though any semblance of post-punk cool's been swapped out for some truly old-time rock'n'roll vibes.   Gatesmith might still be playing catch up with the Rolling Stones (according to <a href=""http://www.minnpost.com/jimwalsh/2012/01/13/34304/acclaimed_howler_celebrates_debut_album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this interview</a> with the <i>MinnPost</i>), but the group's deployment of Chuck Berry-esque licks and various Spectorian flourishes (including yet another ""Be My Baby"" drumbeat nod) shows they at least have a cursory knowledge of the classics.  They also have a way with dynamics; I wouldn't be surprised if the two-tiered guitar assault essayed on the chorus of ""Beach Sluts"" was the result of someone wanting to approximate what the 11 on the volume knob would sound like.</p>
<p>Why the album kicks off with ""Beach Sluts"" and not a standout track like ""Back of Your Neck"", though, is beyond me.  The latter's affable charm (corny Bonnie &amp; Clyde shout-out notwithstanding) is a much better first foot forward. But that track finds itself on the album's back end, grouped with the hazy (possibly shoegazey) ""Free Drunk"" and carefree, surf-friendly ""Black Lagoon"", all of them highlights.  Instead, the album follows up a somewhat bracing introductory note with an assortment of OK to not-so-OK tunes that ultimately congeal into an undifferentiated, if intermittently enjoyable, lump, before ending on a high note.  In other words, <i>America Give Up</i> is inconsistent and derivative yet promising, and not nearly as impressive as some early adopters would have people believe: a pretty typical rock group's first album.  And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p></div>"|16212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16212-howler-america-give-up/|6.0|David Raposa

If you enjoyed the gnarled oomph of <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/horsebacknoise"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Horseback</a>'s take on bottom-heavy black metal, then get ready to hear that heaviness reduced to the merest eerie echo floating through that collage. Yet while their solo releases could frustrate via skill-without-conviction, or feel like retreads of well-worn metal sounds, these two bands seem newly invigorated by working together, and the collaborative <i>A Throne Without a King</i> takes a real chance, risks real failure, and goes further out than either group has on its own. While so much avant metal fails to truly scramble the genre's rules, often offering little more than weakened takes on metal's essentials, Pyramids and Horseback have jointed forces here to create a stylistic mutant.</p>
<p><i>A Throne Without a King</i> will probably repulse the folks out there sporting Repulsion tattoos. It will also probably puzzle those who prefer their black and/or doom metal with a comforting glaze of My Bloody Valentine-style melody. That's a shame, but it's hardly surprising. True, there are few moments of hardcore riffage and burning-at-the-stake screams. And there are moments of swirling beauty that could have easily been lifted off a shoegaze (or even early IDM) record. But rather than simply smushing two sorta-complementary genres together, <i>Throne </i>explores extremes of abrasive and soft, oblique structure and seeming formlessness, rather than simply recycling elements from the-genre-known-as-extreme-music. A long-form collage of feedback and fractured electronics, where the wary won't be asking ""is this metal?"" so much as ""what <i>is</i> this?"" If that kind of exploratory amorphousness, with a side of blackened ugliness, sounds appealing, you probably already know if you need this. In one of our rapidly disappearing brick-and-mortar record stores, the sticker might read: ""Recommended if you like dark ambient, old-school academic tape edits, horror movie sound design, the fringes of improv electronics scene, etc.""</p>
<p>Though the main attraction is clearly the album's titular four-part epic, which sprawls for close to an hour, <i>Throne</i> opens with two relatively short and palate-readying tracks, a solo outing from each band. Ostensibly this will allow new listeners to get some idea of the particular aesthetic universes Pyramids and Horseback usually inhabit, before the rest of <i>Throne</i> obliterates those reference points entirely. Pyramids' contribution sounds like recent Mego in a mellow mood, alternating brief hair-raising moments of dissonance with placid electronics. Horseback title their piece in honor of left-field composer Henry Flynt, and you can (very) vaguely hear Flynt's influence in the way this tribute to Norway's corpse-painted heroes collapses midway through into pure drone, only to rebuild itself for one final assault. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13021-a-throne-without-a-king-pt-2/"" target=""_blank"">""A Throne Without a King""</a> parts one through four, however, sounds not much like either of those modes, except for maybe tiny traces sprinkled through its vast and unruly whole.</p>
<p>As with so many longform experimental compositions, boredom lurks when things get too loose. Part three aims at some kind of icky Ferrari/Dockstader musique concrète, all ominous clangs and rattling iron, but goes on way too long, sapping the drama until it all starts to sound like some goth kids aimlessly futzing around in dad's toolshed. Much better are the moments when <i>Throne</i> goes majestic rather than minimalist. Part two pits angelic choirs against disruptive blasts of static; part four subjects glacial atmosphere à la Wolfgang Voigt to what sounds like several corrupted mp3s' worth of digital distortion. It's here Pyramids and Horseback evoke certain metal qualities, the grandeur and the gloom, the brutality and fearlessness, without needing to actually draw on metal's vocabulary. If they'd managed that across the whole piece, ""A Throne Without a King"" might be a minor masterpiece of modern, unsettling sound manipulation. As it is, while it's impossible to claim that every minute of <i>Throne</i> will grip you, even if you’re already attuned to this sort of untethered drift, it's a strong, spooky soundtrack for these early frostbitten months of the year.</p></div>"|16210.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16210-a-throne-without-a-king/|7.0|Jess Harvell

Or, put another way, it's a style that uses the social  space of the dancefloor to deliver news and opinion. Great calypso  singers exploit the same idea your kindergarten teacher did: That  lessons are more happily-- and subliminally-- learned when set to rhythm  and song.</p>
<p>No  singer has had a longer career in calypso and soca than <a href=""http://www.mightysparrow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mighty Sparrow</a>.  He was born in 1935, won his first major prizes in 1956, and still  tours. His best anthologies are considered starting points for anyone  exploring the genre-- a project I accept is probably off the radar for a  lot of listeners, especially in North America, where ""calypso"" has the  unfortunate reputation as that stuff they play in the background of ads  for all-inclusive vacation packages.</p>
<p>The  music supporting calypso singers is catchy and formulaic, and like all  catchy, formulaic music, it requires craft and discipline-- a calypso  band is only as good as its ability to subtly vary its tunes without  upstaging its singer. The music, affable and upbeat as it may be, is  backlighting for its singer.</p>
<p>Sparrow's  personality is big, complex, and contradictory. He plays the fool for  two verses only to prove his wisdom in the third. He boasts and judges.  He unwittingly insults himself with a huge grin on his face. On <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7YlFJEZYPo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jean and Dinah""</a>, for example, he celebrates the departure of American  soldiers because it'll give him a better chance to score a hooker.  Politics and sex are treated with the same irreverence-- both, after  all, are just stages for human folly. Sparrow songs offer a perfect kind  of satisfaction, the kind viewers get from the neat circles of sitcoms  and folktales. At the end, everyone-- often including Sparrow himself--  ends up out on their asses.</p>
<p>His  sense of humor is particular to the marginalized and disenfranchised.  The past 500 years of Trinidad's history is a history of occupation--  first by the Spanish from Columbus' time until the end of the 18th  century, when it was surrendered to the British, and used as a naval hub  by the United States during World War II. Sparrow's songs hint at  imperialism and national identity, but in the lighthearted way of  someone who ultimately can't do anything about them. Laughter, in  essence, is the source of Sparrow's intelligence but also of his  self-preservation.</p>
<p>On ""Don't Go, Joe"", for example-- which can be found on the compilation <i>Volume One</i>-- Sparrow sings about an American soldier who seduces his sister, Millie  and then runs back to his wife and kids, but not before Millie  pickpockets him. In a surprising line, he witnesses the soldiers crying  in port. This shakes his expectations of them-- for a second, they're  humanized. The song is at its core a comedy, but one shot through with  the heartache of watching the imperialists have their way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither ""Jean and Dinah"" nor ""Don't Go Joe"" are on  <i>Sparrowmania!</i>. None of his best songs are, really. The collection's cover has a nice, vintage feel, the kind that says <i>we</i>'<i>re a comprehensive reissue label that cares about quality and selection</i>, and while Strut has released some high-quality compilations, this isn't  one of them. Ultimately, it's just another collection in a pile of  Sparrow collections divided between incisive, entertaining tracks, five-minute double-entendres about boners, and one-off experiments cherrypicked from a long and inconsistent career. Also, the sound  is curiously awful, as if the music were mastered from a cranked-up  transistor radio.</p>
<p>Ah!  how it pains me to type that. People deserve a two-disc Sparrow comp to  bury all other Sparrow comps, but this isn't it (Smithsonian's <i>First Flight</i>,  from 2005, is much better, though it falls off before Sparrow hit his  prime). It's all sad and fitting, in a way: Music from a former colony  gets marginalized by imperialist countries, haphazardly packaged, and  easily ignored. Hopefully, it's the kind of joke Sparrow can take.</p></div>"|16142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16142-mighty-sparrow-sparrowmania/|5.8|Mike Powell

It stood up as a strong example of psychedelic rock rewired for an audience more attuned to<span> </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/"" target=""_blank"">Madvillainy</a><span> </span></i>than <i>The Madcap Laughs</i>. But it still scanned a bit more like a shared vision than an individual voice: The album was just as much a revelation for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28105-the-gaslamp-killer/"" target=""_blank"">Gaslamp Killer</a>, who helmed the bulk of the production and laid down his own mark with a sprawling slate of beats that complemented Valentine's vocalizations.</p>
<p>When the album that introduces a unique vocalist to a newly expanded fanbase also happens to do the same for its equally distinct producer, you wonder how each will fare on his own. If last year's freebie<span> </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16038-the-9th-inning-ep/"" target=""_blank"">9th Inning</a><span> </span></i>EP was a catch-up session of self-created, unreleased older tracks meant to remind newer fans of his broader repertoire,<span> </span><i>MU.ZZ.LE </i>scans like a means to transition from<span> </span><i>A Sufi and a Killer</i>'s multiple-identity psych into more personal territory. And it does this in a way that reinforces what made that previous album great.</p>
<p>Gonjasufi and fellow San Diegan noise-break purveyor Psychopop have centered their production around a codeine-paced, heavy-headed swoon that still manages to bristle with an undercurrent of stress. Psychopop handles beats for four of the 10 cuts, and their half-speed wooziness is like the musical equivalent of the slow-motion running you might experience in an unsettling dream. The headswimming electric piano blues of ""White Picket Fence"" and the loping, pendulous guitar in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12949-feedin-birds/"" target=""_blank"">""Feedin' Birds""</a> set the pace, ethereal as it is, and get a surprising amount of pull from their downtempo floatiness. But Gonjasufi's own production is just as steeped in dubbed-out, crumbly atmospherics. The bass in ""Venom"" glows and throbs, peppered with a jingling percussion timbre halfway between a tambourine and a handful of change. ""Blaksuit"" sounds like a vintage funk 45 flipped to 33, its twangy loop pacing back and forth like a half-finished thought. And even when the snares pop, as they do on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12801-nikels-dimes/"" target=""_blank"">""Nikels and Dimes""</a>, they do so through a thick coating of resin and ash.</p>
<p>If you think that means <i>MU.ZZ.LE </i>is a passive, inert slog of an album, keep in mind that every trudging, straining step of the way is cut through with Gonjasufi's voice, which is still a hell of a thing. The unconventional cast of his voice might be Valentine's most immediately recognizable trait, but it's not his deepest. Every last creaking wail, blown-out mutter, and wounded drone is heavy with reflection, and after a few listens it all starts to sound less like altered-mind eccentricity and more like raw, unfiltered feeling. For all the talk about shroomed-out weirdness and otherworldly mysticism that's surrounded his music, there's a more crucial sense of a real, laid-bare emotional core here.</p>
<p>All those shaky notes and half-intelligible murmurs disintegrating into decaying echoes might run parallel to an oddball <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3288-lee-scratch-perry/"" target=""_blank"">Lee ""Scratch"" Perry</a> sensibility, but they evoke frustration and dejection vividly. The words aren't always clear through the fog of reverb, though this might be by design, some statement on how the plain truth of honest words can be sometimes hard to understand. But the agitated sentiments remain clear, whether castigating against the abuse of privilege in ""Nikels and Dimes"" or straining to maintain an interpersonal connection on ""Rubberband"". When Sumach's wife April has a wraithlike torch-singer turn in the second half of ""Feedin' Birds"" and distantly doubles up his lead on ""Skin"", it's to act as a sweetly voiced counterpart to lyrics that allude to guilt, death, and a search for love. And when the funereal lo-fi new wave of ""The Blame"" emerges near the end of the 24 1/2-minute running length, it's the late peak of a record that wrings out a devastated man's crisis of consciousness-- ""You say I'm not supposed to kill/ Keep walking with my head high/ But every time I go somewhere/ I feel the dread inside their eyes."" <i>MU.ZZ.LE </i>might be a transitional point on Gonjasufi's path and it shows just one face of an eclectic, multifaceted performer. But it's also that rare album that feels meditative and cathartic all at once.</p></div>"|16197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16197-gonjasufi-muzzle/|7.8|Nate Patrin

His best tracks thus far are like graduate-level versions of <i>Billboard</i> busters David Guetta and Calvin Harris' shame-free fist pumpers; they're subtle and spacey, but Greene leaves in enough kick and hook to keep everything floor-friendly.

The two A sides find Greene indulging his R&amp;B tendencies more than ever before, with opener <a href=""http://youtu.be/fuoY5j4aCUc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Flatline""</a> even featuring original vocals from fellow Montrealer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30038-ango/"" target=""_blank"">Ango</a>. But the track doesn't sound like a savvy spin on radio also-rans as much as a wannabe also-ran itself; the ironically flat lead vocal comes off like sub-par <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> karaoke while the skittering instrumental recalls Timbaland in latter-day <a href=""http://youtu.be/ZSM3w1v-A_Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Apologize""</a> mode. Clearly, it's one thing to gush about R&amp;B heavies like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">The-Dream</a> and Drake in interviews and cannily slip them into DJ mixes-- <a href=""http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/8139/1/rise-producer-jacques-greene"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">both of which Greene has done</a>-- but quite another to successfully emulate them.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Much better is ""These Days"", where the 21-year-old once again squeezes the most out of a well-chosen sample-- Mario's 2004 album cut <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMKWPSwjLlI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Couldn't Say No""</a>-- while also moving forward, switching out standard kicks for bottom-crawling tom hits. On the flip side are two more traditional two-step tracks, ""Clark"" and ""Arrow"", both unfortunately not quite living up to the lofty rep Greene has quickly earned. Whereas <i>The Look</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12191-another-girl/"" target=""_blank"">""Another Girl""</a> displayed a tidy sense of dynamics and a just-right ear for attention-getting sonic finery, these two simply glide by on their own blandly classy ambiance. For someone who has nailed that exquisite limbo between foreground and background, Greene lets ""Clark"" and ""Arrow"" drift away too easily.</p>
<p class=""p1"">To reiterate: Jacques Greene is very good at one thing. That one thing is unique and not easy to pull off. And there are still undiscovered corners for this producer to take his sample-based club sound before he jumps into the realm of more traditional song structures and vocals (which probably shouldn't be thought of as a be-all, end-all anyhow) or extended instrumentals, à la the nine-minute ""Arrow"". So <i>Concealer</i> has all the marks of a transitional release, a feeler. While constant reinvention is a nice ideal, it's not for everyone.</p></div>"|16207.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16207-concealer-ep/|6.7|Ryan Dombal

When Erick Purkhiser and Kristy Wallace met in 1972, they discovered they were both into the same kind of thing: the music of 15 years or so earlier that had been all about kitsch and shock and sleaze, with shitty sonics and snarling, hiccuping singers, and hilarious over-the-top bravado. In the early 1970s, being into ""50s rock'n'roll"" meant <i>American Graffiti</i> and Sha Na Na and ""Happy Days"". Wallace and Purkhiser preferred the nasty also-rans-- the records that actually <i>tried</i> to be the threat to society that people sometimes pretended pop music could be.</p>
<p>It wasn't much of a leap to starting their own band in the same mode. Purkhiser reinvented himself as Lux Interior, the slavering, writhing, nearly naked, ectomorphic frontman of the Cramps, and Wallace was Poison Ivy Rorschach, a ""bad girl"" in leather and wigs and velvet who tore off one ichor-dripping 12-bar guitar riff after another. They didn't have a whole lot in common with their early punk scenemates other than big guitar noise, but punk rock gave them license to do sleazy, shocking, sopping wet rock'n'roll without having to bother with the usual thin veneer of respectability.</p>
<p>The Cramps were an institution for over 30 years, until Lux's death in 2009. They were one of the few punk-era bands who were well served by aging, since they were trying to come off like creepy, depraved old people in the first place. But they were always a better singles band than an album band, and a way better live act than a singles band. Most of the songs that made their reputation are collected on this suitably trashy set. The vinyl version of <i>File Under Sacred Music</i> is, appropriately, a ""collectible"" box of the band's first 10 singles in replica sleeves--or rather, it would be except that four of them were never actually issued as singles at the time. (The Cramps always did snicker at anything that claimed to be authentic.)</p>
<p>That's probably the ideal way to hear this material: Lux, Ivy, and their ever-rotating associates made the kind of strong, silly records that are best in hot-sauce doses of between three and six minutes. They occasionally came up with fabulously personal-space-invading originals like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPOVmWzeqEo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Human Fly""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTpN3Nawts8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""New Kind of Kick""</a>, the latter of which features two lines that explain their <i>raison d'être</i>: ""Life is short/ Filled with stuff"" and ""I learned all I know by the age of nine."" The better part of <i>File Under Sacred Music</i>, though, is the crate-digging covers that were their calling card.</p>
<p>Their first single (produced, like a lot of their early material, by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28727-alex-chilton/"" target=""_blank"">Alex Chilton</a>) was a cover of one of the most familiar trash-rock staples, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHCbZShZdWM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Surfin' Bird""</a>, extended to five minutes with a sloppy gnarl of guitar and drum noise. They subsequently shied away from anything that familiar. Instead, they turned their attention to obscurities whose quirks they exaggerated to the point of perversion. Jack Scott's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s70y40ba7k8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Way I Walk""</a> was slowed down to a psychotic limp, with Lux hyperventilating every line and Ivy screaming bloody murder in the background; Ronnie Cook &amp; the Gaylads' nutty novelty <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQQjfmKjXNU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Goo Goo Muck""</a> turned into a hilariously lascivious threat on which Lux shrieked, trilled, gurgled, and enunciated the title like it referred to whatever bodily fluids your parents feared most.</p>
<p>The title of <i>File Under Sacred Music</i> is a joke about the dusty record stores the Cramps loved, as well as about their own discography: <i>Songs the Lord Taught Us</i> was the title of their first album, <i>Songs the Cramps Taught Us</i> the name of one of the many series of bootlegs of the original songs they covered. But the amazing, out-of-control music they saved from oblivion could show them up, at least on record. To hear the Novas' feral pro-wrestling novelty <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvBN3C2wepY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Crusher""</a> (""<i>Do the hammerlock, ya turkeynecks!</i>"") next to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5gRD549UAo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Cramps' cover</a> is to understand the difference between lunatics who've somehow ended up with a mic in front of them and record collectors doing a solid, deliberate impression of lunatics.</p></div>"|16202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16202-the-cramps-file-under-sacred-music-early-singles-1978-1981/|8.0|Douglas Wolk

When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9569-pussy-galore/"">Pussy Galore</a> reformed for one of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>'s annual Hanukkah shows this past December, he was nowhere to be seen. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux/"">Royal Trux</a> reissues Drag City's put out barely seem different from the original releases. And any thoughts of him getting back together with former Trux partner Jennifer Herrema seem more remote than ever, especially as she just delivered her best album in years under her new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30046-black-bananas/"">Black Bananas</a> guise. Despite apparently living by a never-look-back creed, there are usually a few signifiers in each new record by <a href=""http://www.howlinghex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Howling Hex</a>-- a strained, phlegm-ridden growl, a stack of stodgy riffs-- that make everything he does suitably Hagerty-esque. Even the title <i>Wilson Semiconductors</i> feels like an obscure nod back to the inert object fetishization of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2XHSjEVQ3k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ray O Vac""</a> from <i>Thank You</i>.</p>
<p>This is an EP of four long songs that continues the drum-less setup on the 2008 Howling Hex record <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12302-earth-junk/"">Earth Junk</a></i>, with a simple guitar/bass/vocal set up getting the job done. It's ragged and detached, with dips into tight song structure followed by long, meandering guitar passages that feel like you're tied up in a loose strand of thought circling Hagerty's brain. He's lived out in the desert in New Mexico for some time now, and it's not hard to hear that influence at work here, especially on the ranchero flavor of the waltz-time closer ""A Game of Dice"". Except, this being Hagerty, it's sci-fi ranchero, full of squelching, thickset guitar parts, joined by a reedy vocal line that makes it sound like it was recorded when he needed to pee real hard. It probably was. So, in many ways, this is an extension of the work he began on <i>Earth Junk</i>, albeit with a few divots to negotiate along the way.</p>
<p>On the opening ""Reception"", Hagerty works up a bouncy guitar undertow over which his vocal finger wagging warns up-and-comers about the perils of entering the music game. It's got the kind of authoritative cadence that his best work always has, where you feel like you're suddenly privy to a nugget of invaluable information, no matter how silly it looks on the page. In that sense Hagerty works in a great rock'n'roll tradition, where delivery begets meaning. The intent derived from the whiney, doubled-up vocal line, ""Reception, it can take a long time,"" can be parsed in a million different ways. But the way Hagerty conveys it-- swamping the mix, dripping with resonance-- leaves you in little doubt that some kind of indeterminate wisdom is being imparted by a tyrannical autocrat, and it's time to simply shut up and take notice.</p>
<p>But, as with most material the Howling Hex have produced, <i>Wilson Semiconductors </i>easily passes from that kind of despotic strut to something more freeform. ""Brunette Roulette"" is an extended guitar exercise, shorn of vocals, edging close to the nine-minute mark with no particular place to go. It draws elements of freak folk into the mix, with a frantically strummed acoustic guitar loop underpinning strident soloing followed by a honeyed coating of flange two-thirds of the way through. ""Play This When You Feel Low"" is an unfocussed bridging of both worlds, with wild avant soloing conjoined to heavily reverbed vocals that struggle to find a place to sit comfortably. Each track here encounters a similar problem at some point. There are plenty of impulses worthy of exploration, but too often they end up tarnished by a listless desire to meander without direction, making <i>Wilson Semiconductors </i>feel more like a stopgap than a valuable addition to Hagerty's canon.</p></div>"|16200.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16200-wilson-semiconductors/|5.4|Nick Neyland

That it rarely breaks artists of note? <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11279-pop-ambient-2008/"" target=""_blank"">Got it</a>. It has become difficult to tease differences out of the series as its chapters have grown voluminous, and I'll submit that the real question we need to ask about the <i>Pop Ambient</i> series is not what remains unsaid but what the series itself has left to say. <i>Pop Ambient 2012</i> arrives at a time when ambient and experimental artists routinely sing for their supper, offering theoretical frameworks and positioning their works as commentaries on music, media, and memory.</p>
<p>The goals of the <i>PA</i> series and its artists are largely sonic, bridging the gaps, however tenuously, between electronic music, modern classical, and pop. The series' flower motif suggests a kinship with Erik Satie's concept of furniture music, or music explicitly intended for the background. Gorgeous soundtracking is a fair, modest goal of ambient composers, but music of this ilk-- from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28582-leyland-kirby/"" target=""_blank"">Leyland Kirby</a> (and his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29716-the-caretaker/"" target=""_blank"">Caretaker</a> alias) to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>-- has felt so vibrant and rich in recent years that the offerings here seem slight. Stop me if you've heard this one before: <i>PA12</i> contains another new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5821-wolfgang-voigt/"" target=""_blank"">Wolfgang Voigt</a> side project (Mohn, with Jörg Burger), a Kompakt techno stalwart making his first-ever series contribution (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4074-superpitcher/"" target=""_blank"">Superpitcher</a>), and notable outsiders (Simon Scott). Intrigued? Which volume of the series did you pull off the shelf to listen to in anticipation of these revelations?</p>
<p>Forgive the cynicism. The failure of <i>PA12</i> has little to do with the individual tracks, most of which could, at worst, be harmlessly swapped out for the third-most-forgettable offering on any given <i>PA</i> compilation. There are highlights, as always: the beautiful simplicity of the piano that steers Superpitcher's ""Jackson""; Wolfgang Voigt's ruptured, surprising orchestrations on ""Rückverzauberung 5"". Five years after lighting up <i>PA07</i> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"" target=""_blank"">the Field</a>'s ""Kappsta"", Axel Wilner debuts his new guise, Loops of Your Heart, whose ""Riding the Bikes"" closes <i>PA12</i> with lacy, somnambulent guitar. (In other words, the only new standout on <i>PA12</i> is the alias of an artist who has already released three full-lengths for Kompakt.) There are more obvious missteps than in previous years, though. On ""Richmodis"", Triola masses clanging minor chords into a long, useless noir. Mohn's comp-opening offering, ""Manifesto"", is not just slow and ringing but comically ponderous. Magazine's self-edit of ""The Visitors Bureau"" is pro-forma symphonic drift.</p>
<p>Just as <i>Now That's What I Call Music 40</i> hardly suggests permanence, <i>PA12</i> is damned by its place in a series that grew stale several years ago. This is not even the best ambient compilation Wolfgang Voigt has appeared on in the past year: Kompakt regulars Andrew Thomas and bvdub (who makes an appearance here) compiled <i>Air Texture Vol. 1</i>, a frothy, generous collection that outmaneuvers <i>PA12</i> at every turn. Ambient music feels rich and diverse right now, willing to engage with wider worlds. The expanses of <i>PA12</i>'s tracks belie how cloistered and small the compilation actually is. There's nothing wrong with music that knowingly fades into the background, so long as you accept that sometimes the only room you're wallpapering is your own.</p></div>"|16203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16203-pop-ambient-2012/|4.5|Andrew Gaerig

Later in the same song, he calls out another 1970s rock icon: ""The best advice I've ever gotten was from good ol' Johnny Rotten,"" he confesses, before launching into a few lines from ""God Save the Queen"". As rock touchstones go, Queen and the Sex Pistols aren't too far off the beaten path; he could have quoted Alex Chilton or Damo Suzuki or even Elvis Costello, but that would miss the point. Finn is after the artists and music that try to make rock a communal rather than a private experience. So he's an unlikely hero for the cloistered and segmented indie rock crowd, which we're told prizes obscurity over accessibility. Ironically for a band whose lyrics depicted geographically specific subsubcultures, Finn's day-job group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"" target=""_blank"">the Hold Steady</a> brought a bar-band approach back into the indie rock world. They strove for broad appeal, which circa 2005's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3977-separation-sunday/"" target=""_blank"">Separation Sunday</a></i> sharpened their guitar attack and made them sound almost dangerous.</p>
<p>Over time, however, that same populism softened the Hold Steady's edges and blunted their urgency, and Finn's solo album, whose title is cribbed and scrambled from ""Friday Night Lights"", may be the culmination of that particular trajectory. If most solo albums at least make an effort to distinguish themselves from the artist's main outlet-- to justify their very existence-- Finn's chief tactic on these songs is to play everything close to the chest, to dial the music back and the intensity down. That's fine for songs such as ""Western Pier"" and closer ""Not Much Left of Us"", but deadly for ""When No One's Watching"" and ""Honolulu Blues"", which sound like he's consciously trying to avoid sounding like his main band. The guitars rarely venture toward riff or melody; instead, they provide atmosphere and mood. But so much of <i>Clear Heart Full Eyes</i> cries out for louder guitars, Springsteen-like drama, and the kind of precise sloppiness the Hold Steady did so well in the late 2000s.</p>
<p>The album works best when it sounds freshest and furthest away from the music we typically associate with Finn. ""Terrified Eyes"" shuffles around on a laidback beat and a rangy, almost alt-country guitar, as he takes the conspiratorial tone of a tour guide pointing out the sites of crimes and scandals. ""New Friend Jesus"" rambles acoustically, although Finn makes the title character sound like a punchline. That's odd considering how much of the album is given over to some of his most blatantly Catholic (or is that catholic?) lyrics. If <i>Separation Sunday</i> rewrote the rules and rituals of religion as street-level spirituality, <i>Clear Heart Full Eyes</i> mostly plays it straight.</p>
<p>Like some of the best Hold Steady albums, these songs are all interconnected, full of recurring characters and settings, so that even when the tempos lag and the guitars noodle, <i>Clear Heart</i> is pulled along by pure narrative momentum, giving it an immersive power that it doesn't necessarily earn. But that's Finn's main appeal: He's a born storyteller who's chosen rock as his medium. On <i>Clear Heart</i> he creates a new world with unique characters and rules, which are concrete, specific, and evocative. While it pales alongside some of the Hold Steady's best albums, these songs are so entangled with those people and places-- with those Holly and Charlemagne mythologies-- that they never grow tedious or ignorable. So perhaps Finn is turning into someone like Mercury or Rotten, acting as adviser to a new generation of listeners. Like them, he came on like a man on a mission, but now that it's been accomplished, he sounds like a man trying to figure out what comes next. <i>Clear Heart</i> is just good enough to keep us listening.</p></div>"|16201.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16201-clear-heart-full-eyes/|6.0|Stephen M.

Aside from his vague association with Tesfaye and company, there's not much to be found about the mysterious producer. He's let a few of his own productions trickle out over the past few months, and collected them in a free-to-download mixtape called <i>Furthur</i>, a short collection of instrumentals that handily profiles an intriguing new name in an increasingly overcrowded set of knuckle-dragging, mopey hip-hop beatsmiths.</p>
<p>Well, to call it hip-hop wouldn't exactly be accurate: in a fashion similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28640-balam-acab/"" target=""_blank"">Balam Acab</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28780-holy-other/"" target=""_blank"">Holy Other</a>'s, the slow swing and drowsy drop that DropxLife favors is a whole lot more <i>trip</i>-hop than hip-hop. We're talking <i>real</i> trip-hop here: There are moments on <i>Furthur</i> that sound uncannily like mid-1990s Bristol-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"" target=""_blank"">Portishead</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"" target=""_blank"">Massive</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4285-tricky/"" target=""_blank"">Tricky</a>-- updated for 2012, and the ones that <i>don't</i> tend to lean on other arbiters of downtempo like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1113-dj-shadow/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Shadow</a>, maybe even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4209-thievery-corporation/"" target=""_blank"">Thievery Corporation</a>. Not to be relegated to copycat or crate-digger, however, what makes DropxLife feel less like a retro fetishist is the distinctly digital nature of his work: Loaded with filters, effects, and heavily-processed sounds, <i>Furthur</i> has more in common with cloud-rap than the scratchy vinyl samples of early trip-hop.</p>
<p>What the trip-hop dimension does for <i>Furthur</i> is to lend it a relaxed, almost carefree vibe: Like a tranquilized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"" target=""_blank"">RZA</a>, this is unfiltered spliff music with a vaguely orientalist bent, almost too languorous to even imagine someone spitting over it without getting tangled up in the long washes of sound or angled lashes of string instruments. Take opener ""MadexMen"", centering around some filtered coos and a strummed guitar, with slow, glitchy drums that sound like they're sliding off each other: This is remarkably lazy stuff, taking the codeine crawl of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> and like-minded acts to a new plateau of dazed and blazed.</p>
<p>Clams Casino is an essential reference point here: The raspy breezes and gauzy gasps that coat tracks such as ""BexForever"" feel torn right from his page. There are differences of course-- the sub-bass in ""BexForever"" feels far more brutal than anything I've heard by Clams, and a lot of Drop's beats heave and lurch with a wide-arced pendulum swing. But it's still hard not to hear him in the bits of tabla and other light percussive touches that scuff the surface of ""StillxShots"" in a way uncannily similar to the New Jersey producer's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15531-numb/"" target=""_blank"">""Numb""</a>. Taken on their own terms, DropxLife's tracks are more physical, cleaner, composed of disparate elements; if Clams seems to mould and bend songs out of monolithic shapes, DropxLife builds them piece-by-piece from the ground up, but you probably wouldn't think twice about uttering them in the same breath anyway. It's this lack of personality that makes <i>Furthur</i> a merely pleasant listen rather than a truly stimulating one.</p>
<p><i>Furthur</i>'s best moments come when DropxLife goes nuts with the delay effects, creating a dazzlingly shimmering surface that skips and skates over the low end to disorienting effect, like walking the wrong way down a moving conveyor belt (the motion-sickness phasing on ""1stxFlr"" or the dry heave guitar on ""TripXEnt""). But we shouldn't forget who people are rightly going to associate DropxLife with, and highlight ""RedxBloor"" indeed sounds like a chopped-and-screwed Weeknd track, featuring a heart-wrenching vocal sample not unlike the disembodied female voices that pop up on Weeknd tracks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12288-lonely-star/"" target=""_blank"">""Lonely Star""</a> and ""Next"". Even just that snippet of a vocal endows DropxLife's sluggish torpor with a vivacity the rest of it lacks, a liveliness he's going to need to develop if he wants to be anything more than another bloodshot bedroom beatmaker.</p></div>"|16204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16204-furthur/|6.2|Andrew Ryce

At 14 songs and 57 minutes, <i>Resolution</i> feels like the sort of unedited, exhaustively long collection a label might get behind to see if at least one of the songs lands with a wide audience.</p>
<p>Such signs are everywhere on <i>Resolution</i>: Each of the choruses in these rigid Pantera-cum-Slayer recasts are aggressively emphasized, with thickets of backing vocals and rhythms and structures that slow or shift so as to beg you to swallow the hook. Lyrically, Lamb of God certainly write like a young band of heshers out for an angry good time-- Metallica quotes, subverted clichés, and diary-entry misanthropy laced with high-school vocabulary words and winking glimpses of profanity, drugs, and religion. And though the band is not only at its best but its most comfortable with four-minute formulaic tracks-- burst open, barrel ahead, shift at the bridge, regain momentum, and implode at the exit-- they take care to show that, even if young, they're versatile, too, the sort of band that boasts the promise of a varied future. There's the convincingly sludgy opener, the ghostly acoustic moments that serve as intros and interludes, and the creepy spoken-word surge of a closer. And it's all captured with big, bright production by Josh Wilbur, a major-label stable member who has worked with everyone from Steve Earle and Faith Hill to Pink and Limp Bizkit.</p>
<p>But <i>Resolution</i> is Lamb of God's seventh album and their fourth for Epic Records, making them one of the few current American metal bands to sign with and stay on a major label. They've done well there, too, peaking with a chart position of No. 2 for their most recent record, 2009's <i>Wrath</i>, which earned two Grammy nominations and sold a few hundred thousand copies. Those past stats and the Virginia band's status as relative metal statesmen for the mainstream make <i>Resolution</i> that much more disappointing in context.</p>
<p>Despite the handful of hooks that do stick and those big ""risks,"" like the acoustic blues strums at the start of single ""Ghost Walking"" or the belligerent boogie that opens the much better ""Invictus"", Lamb of God's general lack of adventurousness makes them mostly indistinguishable from their heroes and, budget excepted, the bulk of their contemporaries. After a decade of becoming arguably the biggest American metal band that either didn't exist when George H. W. Bush was president or didn't come from a cartoon, you would hope that Lamb of God had earned the right to be adventurous, to try and stretch their legacy wider than that of a band subservient to its predecessors. <i>Resolution</i> simply sounds like a refinement of their past, with their unquestionable technical prowess (especially impressive is the occasional interplay between guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler and drummer Chris Adler) funneled again into songs that would lose any distinction in a mixtape of their peers.</p>
<p>On ""Invictus"", this record's most structurally and lyrically compelling track, Randy Blythe roars the album's least instant but most interesting hook: ""You brand it a crisis/ I name it an honor/ To face what arises/ To remain unconquered."" That ethos reappears throughout <i>Resolution</i>, an album that, despite all this talk of bravery, lacks the resolve to sound anything but normal and predictable. With so much history and more than a million album sold, you'd think sounding mistakably young would be a compliment. But on <i>Resolution</i>, it doesn't equal a band bursting forth with ideas or burning with ambition; it means that, apart from the number of records they've sold, Lamb of God still need to find a way to make an impression last longer than an album cycle.</p></div>"|16198.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16198-resolution/|3.9|Grayson Currin

Klara is younger and shorter, the one with the dark bangs cut right across her heavy eyes, who sings with a crooked underbite that she could probably never set straight without wrecking the lovely specificity of her voice, the slight lisp of it, her languid vowels. Johanna, the older one, about whom everything is long (her limbs, her blondish mane), mostly sings harmony; her voice is darker and heavier and comes from somewhere different from her sister's. Klara seems to coax hers out from just under her tongue, while Johanna, her eyes growing wide and distant whenever she has some bars to herself, often appears to be channeling something far beyond her body, beyond the room, beyond even the sky.</p>
<p>Last year, First Aid Kit went to Omaha make their second album, <i>The Lion's Roar</i>, with Mike Mogis, a producer and also a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">Bright Eyes</a>, perhaps the first band that Klara loved. Their debut, 2010's <i>The Big Black and the Blue, </i>released when the sisters were just 17 and 19, was so striking-- with their otherworldly, interlocking voices and uncanny understanding of imagined adult pains-- that the tracks' demo-grade quality was easily overlooked. This time, though, they have all of Mogis' bells and whistles at their disposal: his way of almost imperceptibly coaxing a song into full bloom, his feel for when to gussy-up and when to strip away, but also, yes, actual bells and whistles, or at least one deeply eerie flute tone that lingers throughout, floating in and out of scenes like a sly specter. And a new clutch of friends appears for the closing track, ""King of the World"", a song so jumpy and earnest and ecstatically terrified by the unknowable future that Conor Oberst seems to have had no choice but to consummate the clear homage to the best of his mid-2000s output by making an appearance himself, along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5686-the-felice-brothers/"" target=""_blank"">the Felice Brothers</a>, whose showing as a wheezy, rattletrap backing band nearly redeems their dismal 2011 album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15401-celebration-florida/"" target=""_blank"">Celebration Florida</a></i>.</p>
<p>For the sisters' part, their voices are steadier now, and richer, as if they were told enough times how good they are that they're finally resigned to believing it. (It's a shame, then, that Mogis can get a bit heavy-handed with the reverb-- their nakedly mic'd voices are almost always more stunning.) The choruses are big and chewy, even on the most melancholy tracks-- ""Blue"" is perhaps one of the more charming songs ever involving the phrase ""now you're just a shell of your former youth"" and would be even without the twinkly glockenspiel and bumpy little bassline. Thanks to Mogis, <i>The Lion's Roar</i> would sound like a very good album even if it wasn’t one-- but likewise would be stunning even if the band had been left to its own devices.</p>
<p>And yes, that's very likely ""Blue"" as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"" target=""_blank"">Joni Mitchell</a> allusion, though the rambling, scatter-pitched confession of ""New Year's Eve"" may be more of a direct tribute. First Aid Kit have this guileless way of making their influences clear, as if offering up the source code of their art to the world, not as proof of anything but in a spirit of communion-- perhaps most specifically making the offering to girls just a few years behind them, sitting under the grip of some pair of huge headphones in their childhood bedrooms, hearing the Söderberg sisters' words and voices for the first time, feeling something shift inside them, wondering where this beautiful thing came from, and finding clues there even before they know it.</p>
<p>""Emmylou"", maybe the best song on the album, and its second single, does this most deftly and most directly. ""I'll be your Emmylou, and I'll be your June/ If you'll be my Gram and my Johnny, too,"" the chorus blurts over bashful drums and wry pedal steel, the sisters shaking out the one-syllable names with giddy relish. Do you know any other song involving young women trying to romance would-be beaus with sweet sweet voices and Americana trivia? ""I'm not asking much of you/ Just sing, little darlin', sing with me,"" the chorus continues, but if all they really wanna do is croon a few numbers, I'll eat my Nudie suit.</p>
<p>Klara and Johanna say they wrote the song before they'd set foot in America. As if to make up for lost time, last year, when they finally came over to the States, they went to California, out to Joshua Tree. It was the birthday of Gram Parsons, who would have been 65 if he hadn't died there when he was 26. They made the music video for ""Emmylou"" there, wearing caftans and drifting side by side through the scrubby desert like characters in a psychedelic Aaron Sorkin drama. They burn incense at a cross made of colored stones, an ad hoc tribute to the more official ad hoc tribute kept up for Parsons there at the park; they wave the smoke with their small hands; they throw out their arms and let their sleeves flutter out in the wind.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I wonder what they thought about when they were out there-- if they felt new, if they felt homesick, if they were somehow disappointed, despite everything, to not see Gram himself wandering over the hills. I wonder if they thought about how they will most likely outlive him, how one day they will have been making music longer than he was even alive, how one day they will outgrow their caftans and their crosses, how the most beautiful songs they're ever going to write are still waiting for them out there in the future somewhere.</p></div>"|16205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16205-the-lions-roar/|7.6|Rachael Maddux

How can you sum up a musician who's appeared on dozens and dozens of records over the last 20 years, rivaling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3504-sun-ra/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Ra</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2744-merzbow/"" target=""_blank"">Merzbow</a> in their similarly fecund and all-over-the-map output? Of course, even someone who contains multitudes occasionally repeats himself, and there are obvious sonic links from one Youngs release to the next. For one thing, his keening voice remains as instantly recognizable on the new <i>Amaranthine</i> as ever, as does his idiosyncratic-unto-inscrutable phrasing, where excessively drawn-out lines trade off with obsessively repeated lyrical fragments. But even still, you'd be hard-pressed to draw a direct line between Youngs' previous two albums and the haunted murk of <i>Amaranthine</i>, even as it focuses on (and amplifies) many of his central obsessions.</p>
<p>For example, his longstanding interest in pushing rule-bound forms like folk and rock and devotional music into the rule-free space of improvisation, or stretching their inherent repetitive natures past the accepted limits. These two modes are taken to a visceral extreme on <i>Amaranthine</i>. Rock is smelted down into a pervasive drone-roar that suggests the music's power while abandoning almost all of its familiar structural elements. Meanwhile, the steady state of that drone is counter-pointed by wild junkyard percussion that denies the very existence of the backbeat. The howl of ecstatic jazz is stripped of any blues or swing until just the yearning for total movement in any direction remains. Youngs' singing veers between liturgical formality and an expressionist bleat that mimics <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/184-albert-ayler/"" target=""_blank"">Albert Ayler</a>'s horn at its most mournful. It's a long and wooly journey into a rather forbidding place. Intriguing, at times overwhelming, and voyeuristic like a peek into a private ceremony. But still forbidding.</p>
<p>On a casual listen, <i>Amaranthine</i> sounds loose <i>and</i> repetitious in a way that suggests the players shut their minds off and got down to some primal state of in-the-moment music making. The obvious suggestion is that you should do the same as a listener, letting the emotion of the sound wash over you. And sure, that's one way to approach it. <i>Amaranthine</i> certainly has the feel of a tribal incantation playing out in real time, of a group losing itself in the unconscious flow, captured in the kind of fuzzed-out fidelity that more recalls a field recording of a wayward cult than an academically precise studio session. The elements that make up <i>Amaranthine</i> are drawn from various strains of free music at their most direct and primal. It's an ""experimental"" album that hits you first on a gut level. Youngs on <i>Amaranthine</i> can sound shamanistic or mind-erasing or beyond words, any of the terms we usually apply to immersive and free-flowing music that seems out to bypass the intellect for chills up the spine and tingling of the arm hairs.</p>
<p>But the one word you'd never use to describe Youngs, however emotionally expressionistic he can get, is ""primitive."" As usual, a scrupulous intelligence lurks behind <i>Amaranthine</i>'s seemingly off-the-dome journey into innerspace. For instance, only an assured musician would attempt the dichotomous mixture Youngs pulls off here, two approaches that might seem at first to be at odds with each other: the mantra-like repetition of drone and the anything-goes invention of free music. Though his music can often have a homemade feeling-- if nothing yet quite as ""séance in the barn"" as <i>Amaranthine-- </i>Youngs is someone who's thought out each aesthetic left-turn as carefully as any arts-grant-endowed composer. He never simply shakes things up for the hell of it, and the new terrain he stakes out almost always turns out to lie within his strengths, however dissimilar it seems from his previous projects on first blush. But even still, it makes sense that <i>Amaranthine</i> is super-limited-edition. His more recent albums-- the skewed pop of 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14467-beyond-the-valley-of-ultrahits/"" target=""_blank"">Beyond the V</a></i><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14467-beyond-the-valley-of-ultrahits/"" target=""_blank"">alley of the Ultra Hits</a></i> and the fractured folk minimalism of 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15728-amplifying-host/"" target=""_blank"">Amplifying Host</a></i>-- may have been (relatively) more user-friendly. But <i>Amaranthine</i> is among the spookiest and least-tethered sets Youngs has released in years, not quite for-fans-only but definitely for those who wanna go way out.</p></div>"|16206.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16206-amaranthine/|7.0|Jess Harvell

After the release of the <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14765-turning-on-leave-you-forever/"" target=""_blank"">Turning On</a>, </i>a self-recorded collection of CD-Rs filled with tuneful alt-punk songs wrapped in tinfoil and steel wool that was released by the tiny California imprint Bridgetown Records, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/cloudnothings/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cloud Nothings</a>' self-titled debut on Carpark was an identifiable point on a familiar trajectory. The clarity afforded even by its modest budget made sweet and airy singles like ""Forget You All the Time"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15243-should-have/"" target=""_blank"">""Should Have""</a> sound revelatory, while more overtly aggro tracks like ""Rock"" and ""Not Important"" felt thin and regressive, unnecessary vestiges of lo-fi provocation that didn't do Baldi many favors.</p>
<p>And then <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12707-no-futureno-past/"" target=""_blank"">""No Future/No Past""</a> arrived as the first single from <i>Attack on Memory. </i>It was brightly produced but tonally dark with a queasy anti-melody-- a confrontational act that suggested that Baldi was going off script. Turns out ""No Future/No Past"" is the least representative track on <i>Attack on Memory</i>, but it opens the album with a necessary slate-clearing. While a full record of fizzy pop-punk would've been welcome, Cloud Nothings are trying for more. As an accidental concept album affirming the enduring power and purity of early emo (as defined by Dischord, Deep Elm, and especially Jade Tree), <i>Attack on Memory </i>feels above all <i>necessary,</i> a corrective for indie rock making allowances for everything except music that actually rocks.</p>
<p>The overhaul is radical: It's literally a different band from the one that made <i>Cloud Nothings</i>. For one thing, Cloud Nothings is actually a <i>band</i> now rather than Baldi's solo project, retaining the lineup that toured with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5160-fucked-up/"" target=""_blank"">Fucked Up</a> and likely learned a lot from them. While the freedom and ease of being a bedroom artist has its advantages, you can't make your own Sunny Day Real Estate and Wipers records without a beastly rhythm section. Even beyond the short window of time that passed between <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15031-cloud-nothings/"" target=""_blank"">Cloud Nothings</a> </i>and <i>Attack on Memory</i>, this is a record that crackles with ""let's get this on tape <i>now</i>"" immediacy-- eight tracks, about half an hour, blunt lyrics, big choruses, lots of screaming. Fussing over these songs would've sapped their urgency.</p>
<p>""No Future/No Past"" is the first gauntlet Baldi throws down but it's not the most daunting. At more than nine minutes, ""Wasted Days"" is far longer than anything on <i>Cloud Nothings. </i>As a radio edit, it could be something like Cloud Nothings' answer to Foo Fighters' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBG7P-K-r1Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Everlong""</a>, a fanged beauty of barbed chords, torrential drum rolls, and impassioned emoting. But as it rolls on, ""Wasted Days"" becomes simultaneously forbidding, disorienting, and psychedelic, something like a black-and-grey kaleidoscope. As the band hurtles to the finish, Baldi repeatedly yells, ""<i>I thought! I would! Be more! Than this!</i>"" in a high-voltage scree as a painful paradox after such an ambitious display of <i>more</i>.</p>
<p>Baldi has always been a hooks guy<i>,</i> and <i>Attack </i>is every bit as catchy as the more rigid and user-friendly <i>Cloud Nothings, </i>and the spaciousness of Steve Albini's recording gives plenty of room for these hooks to careen into each other: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12873-stay-useless/"" target=""_blank"">""Stay Useless""</a> is an anthemic tantrum that shifts rhythm without warning, the bludgeoning riffs of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12988-no-sentiment/"" target=""_blank"">""No Sentiment""</a> give way to the plaintive vocals and jittery snare runs on ""Our Plans"", while ""Cut You"" fades out the record on a gracefully arcing chant that's equally vengeful, self-loathing, and hopeful.</p>
<p>There's the temptation to give too much of the credit to Albini, whose open-door policy has attracted an endless number of cred-deficient bands.  <i>Attack on Memory </i>is unmistakably his work-- Baldi's vocals are close-mic'd and raw, the drums are loud as hell, the guitars are economically panned and almost entirely free of effects processing, and there's actual space in between of all of them. But here's Baldi explaining Albini's role <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45065-cloud-nothings-talk-aggressive-new-steve-albini-produced-album/"" target=""_blank"">to Pitchfork's Jenn Pelly</a>: ""Steve Albini played Scrabble on Facebook almost the entire time [we were recording]. I don't even know if he remembers what our album sounds like."" It was meant as a compliment, but the lesson is clear: A lot of producers would be better off stepping back and doing nothing. <i>Attack on Memory </i>isn't what typically gets classified as a ""headphones record,"" but that's the best way to first experience how <i>alive </i>it sounds, aggressively leaping out at you with real dynamics. Check the giddy explosions out of the pockets of silence punctuating ""Stay Useless"", the offbeat harmonies and rhythmic stumble that sound like happy accidents on ""Fall In"", or Baldi's serrated bark shredding the uneasy full-band détente following the solo of ""No Sentiment"".</p>
<p>That's where you'll find <i>Attack on Memory</i>'s key lyric, ""No nostalgia and no sentiment/ We're over it now and we were over it then,"" making the title's implications clear: If you enjoy this as a work of art, there's an invitation to adopt it as cultural critique. Baldi shares stages and a label with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"" target=""_blank"">Toro Y Moi</a> and joked about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1165-forget-you-all-the-time/"" target=""_blank"">""Forget You All the Time""</a> being ""our most chillwave song"" at a Los Angeles show, so the title is more of a call to be heard in the current climate rather than a total negation of it. But the last Fugazi album came out when Baldi was 10, and it's easy to see ""memory"" as a stand-in for indie's stylistic pervasiveness: de-emphasis of guitars and live performance, passivity over aggression, past over presence, singing like you don't care if you get understood or even heard. That just doesn't cut it for a lot of people his age who wonder if they'll ever witness ""The Argument""'s kind of life-affirming vitality firsthand.</p>
<p>There's a fundamental irony in how a record titled <i>Attack on Memory </i>is such a sonic throwback, while Baldi's lyrics obsess over arrested development and missed opportunities. But like the best of indie's recent <i>guitar </i>bands that dare to skew retro-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck/"" target=""_blank"">Yuck</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29754-the-men/"" target=""_blank"">the Men</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29071-wu-lyf/"" target=""_blank"">WU LYF</a>, to name a few-- <i>Attack on Memory </i>is too visceral to feel like escapism, too vital to feel like cheap revival. Not when this sound's death was the wrongful diagnosis of trendwatchers:<i> </i>Those of us who grew up on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1152-drive-like-jehu/"" target=""_blank"">Drive Like Jehu</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/450-braid/"" target=""_blank"">Braid</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2172-jawbreaker/"" target=""_blank"">Jawbreaker</a> can listen to <i>Attack on Memory </i>and sense their artistic legacy is in good hands, but there will inevitably be teenagers for whom <i>Attack on Memory </i>stands to be <i>that </i>kind of record to call their own. And hopefully we'll all meet up in the mosh pit.</p></div>"|16158.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16158-attack-on-memory/|8.6|Ian Cohen

Needless to say, this was not a turn of events that would've been easy to predict in 2003. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2345-boy-in-da-corner/"" target=""_blank"">Boy in Da Corner</a></i> remains an astounding debut, but one with (in retrospect) very little in the way of crossover potential, at least on a ""chat shows and TV adverts"" scale. In the beginning, ""grime"" summed up Dizzee's sound quite well, a statement of aesthetic principles as much as an easy genre tag. The nasty, minimalist clang of the beats may have been startling, but it was no sane DJ's idea of party fuel. And Dizzee's intensity on the mic suggested a guy who might snap if this rap thing didn't pan out.</p>
<p>But over the next seven years, it worked out better than anyone, especially Dizzee, probably could have guessed when he was just a teenage hellion with a voice like an alarm cutting through the static on London pirate radio. It would be easier to begrudge Dizzee his success if his later music, lightweight as it could get, wasn't so instantly and consistently pleasurable. Still, those of us who first came to love the teeth-baring, don't-give-a-fuck Dizzee couldn't help but hope he'd return to the stomp-and-snarl sound. Well, here you go. A mixtape available for the low asking price of your email address, <i>DirteeTV.com</i> is designed more as a showcase for Dizzee's label/crew Dirtee Stank than a chance for Rascal to flex on his lonesome. But when he hits the track, Dizzee's rapping with an all-or-nothing ferocity that makes <i>Boy in Da Corner</i> sound like the kid he was. And the beats are often take-no-prisoners massive in a way that invites comparisons to Lex Luger, at least if Lex were forced to rebuild his sound from the last 10 years of British bass culture.</p>
<p>It was no surprise to read recently that Detroit rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a> is a Dizzee fan. They both sometimes rock the same edge-of-hysteria flow, as if each time they pick up a mic might be their last chance and they're not at all happy about it. But they've also got a range, from imperious sneer to just-joking nasty boy, that elevates them above the guys forced to shout or mumble because they can't do anything else.  Dizzee takes all tacks here, but he's at his best in the tape's early stretch, when even at his most frantic he seems utterly unfazed by the Brick Squad-grade mayhem of the beats. The first third of <i>DirteeTV.com</i> is some of the most thrilling music Dizzee's recorded in years, and part of the joy is in how tracks like ""Guts N' Glory"" and ""I Want It All"" match the apocalyptic density of the best current American street rap through a wholly UK set of sounds. Likewise he uses that old but still effective grime trick of taking a portentous bit of classical music and looping it to an extreme, heard best on the beastly ""Minimus"", where opera squall straight out of a horror movie meets dancehall drums pitched to a tempo better suited to moshing.</p>
<p>But as with so many American mixtapes where the more famous rapper graciously but mistakenly cedes the spotlight to his squad, the guest stars occasionally threaten to drown out the main draw and drag the proceedings into pedestrian, just-another-mixtape territory. When Dizzee's magnetism disappears entirely, don't worry about feeling too much guilt over your urge to hit the skip the button. Special shout to D Double E, though, whose ability to maul a vowel remains unmatched on either side of the Atlantic. And while any MC will bring a much-needed dose of adrenaline to the cavernous murk of the tracks where grime and dubstep seem damn near interchangeable, things do get a little flat in the middle stretch, where that minimalism almost gives way to plain torpor. Thankfully things rebound in the final third, especially on ""Wavestation"", which rescues the noble tradition of the bass drop from Skrillex's cloddish peers, cooking up something more like an arcade game rewrite of Dead Prez's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAD4FKNpvsk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hip-Hop""</a> b-line.</p>
<p>Like most of its American cousins, <i>DirteeTv.com</i> is too long by at least six or seven tracks, and not always the ones where Dizzee steps aside for his vibe-sapping pals. Did he really need to recycle his own moldy oldies on ""Ain't Havin It""? And the quality control is too lax, especially during the middle stretch that teeters on the edge of grime-by-numbers, to plausibly call it any kind of instant classic. On the other hand, like those weekly U.S. transmissions from the DatPiff nation, it's also free, so you can't get too grouchy about having to prune the dull beats after downloading. And it's a chance to hear Dizzee rapping at fearsome full tilt, something we haven't gotten enough of since he started scoring multiple No. 1 hits at home. He attacks these no-crossover-bullshit beats with the aggression of a rapper who's still got something to prove, but with a confidence that comes only when you've already outperformed everyone's expectations, especially your own.</p></div>"|16190.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16190-dirteetvcom/|7.0|Jess Harvell

<p>On 2002's Barsuk release <i>Let Go</i>, Nada Surf re-emerged as the little brother to label-mates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"" target=""_blank"">Death Cab For Cutie</a>-- the sophomoric 1990s angst swapped out for more deliberate melodies and softer arrangements both timely, as that brand of indie rock was beginning to take over, and timeless. A decade later, soft-touch ""indie adult contemporary"" has become 2011's agreed-upon national wallpaper, and Nada Surf are attempting to make some noise.</p>
<p>Noting that they've ""always played faster and a little harder live,"" frontman Matthew Caws and crew set out to capture the raw, excited feel of a practice-room jam session with seventh album <i>The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy</i>, the followup to the 2010's <i>If I Had a Hi-Fi</i>. They come out of the gate strong with the distorted guitar crunch and shimmying hi-hats of ""Clear Eye Clouded Mind"". The song's energizing pre-chorus almost sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4207-the-thermals/"" target=""_blank"">Thermals</a>-lite, with lines that start at the end of each measure and wrap around to the next, always landing on that initial ""I.""</p>
<p>The album is upbeat throughout, especially by Nada Surf standards, with the rhythm section propelling several songs. But maybe ""recapture"" is a more precise word for the urge behind <i>Astronomy</i>'s liveliness. Multiple songs dwell on feelings of disillusionment and lost youth. ""When I Was Young"" recounts the banal minutes of a day over willowy finger picking before the song swells and Caws wonders, ""When I was young... what was that world I was dreaming of?"" ""Let the Fight Do the Fighting"" cautions, ""You're gonna wish that you were young again/ You're gonna wish that it was fun/ You're gonna wanna have someone again."" Most troublesome, though, might be ""Teenage Dreams"", the nth iteration of that song title in recent memory, whose chorus, ""It's never too late for teenage dreams,"" comes dangerously close to the realm of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOnjCavBzzk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""30 Rock"" parody</a>.</p>
<p>These are larger existential longings than pining for another cross-over hit, of course, but they feed into an idea of the band as past its prime-- which is strange, since Nada Surf seem so comfortable coasting. Caws' voice is still light and feathery, the band members are all nimble enough musicians, and songs such as ""Waiting for Something"" touch the same dull sweet spot that's secretly tickled by, say, the Gin Blossoms' radio hits. But for all its adeptness of craft and attempts at revitalization, <i>The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy</i> still feels like an album with precious little at stake. The songs are fine but largely feckless, and what could be an animating contrast between glum lyrics and upbeat music is too often hobbled by clunkers both generic (""I am lost in my mind when you go to sleep"") and specific (something about tarot cards). At a moment when indie rock could probably use a little kick in the ass, Nada Surf seem to have the right instincts, just maybe not the spleen to pull them off. Harder and faster isn't necessarily a young man's game, but it isn't really Nada Surf's either.</p></div>"|16187.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16187-nada-surf-the-stars-are-indifferent-to-astronomy/|4.4|Eric Grandy

But tracing their lineage back through last year's <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/29234-roc-marciano/"" target=""_blank"">Roc Marciano</a> collaboration <i>Greneberg</i> and 2010's <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14717-gutter-water/"" target=""_blank"">Gutter Water</a></i> brings up a still-recent origin point in <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/6765-the-alchemist/"" target=""_blank"">the Alchemist</a>'s 2009 all-star blowout, <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13329-chemical-warfare/"" target=""_blank"">Chemical Warfare</a></i>. The precedent for the collaboration between Alchemist and fellow producer-slash-MC <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/3211-oh-no/"" target=""_blank"">Oh No</a> was strongly established on cuts like ""Acts of Violence"" and ""Under Siege"", a couple of cartoonishly sinister tracks that pushed indie/street crossover rawness into a no-fucks-given irreverence about how raw it actually was. If you want a quick-and-dirty idea of what kind of flag they planted, take into account that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_lCOWVkrb4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their equivalent of a funny-wigs ""Sabotage"" video</a> was footage of them doing violent slapstick spliced into newscast tapes of the Rodney King riots.</p>
<p>So why does it feel like they've been around longer? Besides the fact that Alchemist and Oh No are veteran presences on their own-- the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6TrQzNTrRA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""We Gonna Make It""</a> producer meets the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsbYTNOKUm4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Supermagic""</a> producer would be a fascinating-enough odd-couple pitch-- there's been a lot of conceptual forward momentum at work in their last two-and-a-half years. If <i>Gutter Water </i> dragged the grimier tendencies of underground hip-hop through a dysentery-infected toilet party and <i>Greneberg</i> was <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14720-marcberg/"" target=""_blank"">Marcberg</a></i>'s weirdly invigorating hangover, then <i>Vodka &amp; Ayahuasca </i>is a stab at drunk-psych nightmarishness that runs on slasher-flick suspense. Throw in a bit of weirdo grossout comedy-- the intro track has one of the nastiest clips of someone puking I've ever heard on record-- and you've got a good indication of a couple of artists trying to outdo themselves in the outrageousness department.</p>
<p>How much they succeed rests on how well these two fuse their production styles, and Alchemist's knack with stoner-friendly, vaguely arena-rockish loops, recently exhibited at its best on <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a>'s <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15385-covert-coup/"" target=""_blank"">Covert Coup</a></i>, slots in well with Oh No's affinity for age-caked lo-fi detritus of obscure origin. Dirty-sounding guitars slash through ""Gladiator Music"", ""Dark Shades"", and ""Drink Up"", and with their churning riffs draining the cathartic payoff out of their old acid-rock contexts, what's left is a scraping, growling squall. Pianos and synthesizers are dragged shuddering out from the basement and worked into nerve-twisting loops, giving ""Top Instructors"" and ""The Groove"" a forceful tension. Basslines and breaks stay heavy and crisp, even through the most weeded-out doom-tempo trudges, while ""Flame Throwers"" and ""Odds Cracked"" in particular have enough bounce in them to keep a front-to-back listen from getting bogged down in murk.</p>
<p>That atmosphere helps hold up <i>Vodka &amp; Ayahuasca</i>'s sense of anarchic, altered-state unease when the lyrics don't quite cut it, though the tolerable-at-worst punchlines and metaphors are easier to stomach the less dead-serious you take them. Alchemist's badgering flow is self-assured and self-aware enough to give even his clunkiest lines an ""I meant to do that"" affability, turning his Marmaduke namedrops and organ-trafficking threats from corny to actually-kinda-funny. (It helps that when he's on, he's <i>on,</i> his paint-huffer odyssey on ""Auralac Bags"" in particular.) Oh No's technique is standard-issue Left Coast abstraction, prone to its share of attention-getting moments for internal-rhyme wonks, and when he takes the reins there's some tightly-wound phraseology to dissect.</p>
<p>But the most memorable lines either come from guest spots-- Kool G Rap and Roc Marciano flat-out repossess ""Gladiator Music"" and ""Drink Up"" respectively-- or the found-sound clips about hallucinogen freakouts and belligerent arrestees that provide the most unhinged moments. No matter-- if <i>Vodka &amp; Ayahuasca</i> is worth listening to, it's not an easy equation of lyrics versus beats. What's crucial is that it feels like an album-length distillation of that moment in a horror movie where the suddenness of a character's death is overtaken by how exaggeratedly gruesome the aftermath is.</p></div>"|16168.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16168-gangrene-vodka-ayahuasca/|7.1|Nate Patrin

Like that project, the 26-year-old multi-instrumentalist could be described as DIY Brooklyn's answer to 1970s Manhattan crossover composers like Glenn Branca and Rhys Chatham, artists who merged the endless repetitions of minimalism with the amplitude and instrumentation of punk. Greenberg is a trained jazz guitarist who's been gigging around the city in rock bands of all stripes since he was in middle school. He was a founding member of the defunct New York art-punk trio <a href=""http://pygmyshrews.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pygmy Shrews</a>, and was recently recruited to play with local rock iconoclasts <a href=""http://wearethemen.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Men</a>, whose <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15629-leave-home/"" target=""_blank"">Leave Home</a></i> LP he engineered.</p>
<p><i>Hubble Drums</i> finds Greenberg channeling his affinity for high-intensity marathon jams into an elemental formula: a guitar, a chain of delay pedals, and a handful of melodic progressions, most of them barely a second long. In the live setting, Hubble's music can feel like a collision between <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8kcuqIqmIU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robert Fripp guitar noodling</a> and minimalist experiments in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su1OvwR3wB4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">phasing</a>. As he draws each melodic fragment out into a sprawling, 10-to-20-minute epic, Hubble also becomes the spectacle of Greenberg struggling against himself, pushing up against the limits of his own psychic and physical endurance.</p>
<p>In the context of the contemporary synth revival, the result will hold particular appeal for fans of Emeralds, early <a href=""http://pointnever.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, <a href=""http://www.keithfullertonwhitman.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Keith Fullerton Whitman</a>, and other stargazing, kosmische-inspired musicians in the practice of mining the meditative potential of the endless arpeggiation. The difference between them being that Hubble's music is partly a showcase of Greenberg's technical virtuosity, the intensity of which makes it exausting for him to perform. Either through conscious manipulation or human error, Greenberg seems to exhaust every possible micro-variation of each of the phrases he attacks. The catch is that none of the the melodies ever resolve themselves, creating a state of suspension that can feel either like euphoria or anxiety, escapism or entrapment, without us even noticing the change. (Note that, though I wasn't involved in its selection, a track by Greenberg appears on a compilation I'm organizing with a friend.)</p>
<p>Where<i> Hubble Drums</i> really inspires, however, is when Greenberg introduces a bit more textural play, cranking the distortion on 20-minute closer ""Glass Napkin"" just enough to evoke a scorched Grateful Dead jam or a slightly over-indulgent Hendrix solo. It's uncomfortable and pleasingly familiar at the same time, and it makes minimalism à la Terry Riley sound eerily compatible with what is probably the most maximalist rock-n-roll trick in the bag: shredding. Greenberg's <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2011/11/16/142410700/first-watch-hubble-soundtracks-hubble-telescope-images"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent collaboration</a> with Tiffany Borders from the Space Telescope Science Institute and video artist Sheena Callage, which sets ""Hubble's Hubble"" to imaging of actual Hubble telescope data, gives a good visual metaphor for our listening experience, both here and elsewhere on this beautifully troubling debut: an endless back-and-forth between details and expanses, wide angles and extreme close-ups, anxiety and awe.</p></div>"|16191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16191-hubble/|7.3|Emilie Friedlander

<p><a href=""http://www.chairlifted.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chairlift</a>'s second full-length, <i>Something</i>, is a major creative leap, but on a superficial level, it's not that different from their debut. They're still mining uncool and untapped corners of 1980s pop for inspiration, and singer Caroline Polachek has doubled down on a vocal style that alternates between joyfully expressive and charmingly deadpan. But the melodies are bolder, the arrangements have more snap and sparkle, and Polachek has thankfully moved beyond the first album's overly cerebral lyrics to embrace emotionally potent lines that explore the subtler dynamics of romantic relationships and the evolution of character.</p>
<p>Of course, Chairlift aren't exactly the same group that broke into the outskirts of the mainstream when their 2008 hit <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ9hLOHj8ag"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bruises""</a> found its way into an Apple ad. Founding member Aaron Pfenning split with the group after his romantic relationship with Polachek ended. (He now has an atmospheric disco project called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29824-rewards/"" target=""_blank"">Rewards</a>.) Now a duo, Polachek and multi-instrumentalist Patrick Wimberly have a different chemistry. Wimberly, a producer on several <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a> tracks, excels at composing slick music that retains force and physicality, which suits Polachek's voice and melodies. As a result, <i>Something </i>is cleaner and more elegant, buffing their crisp electronic pop to an immaculate sheen.</p>
<p>Polachek's presence fades when the music gets too inert, but Chairlift turn that potential liability into a strength on two of <i>Something</i>'s most beautiful tracks: On ""Frigid Spring"" and ""Turning"", she pushes her voice to a breathy, ethereal extreme. More often, though, her voice is lucid and assertive. She's excellent with subtle phrasing, selling wry lyrics without getting too smirky, and conveying infatuation without sounding overly elated. She's especially fond of Robert Smith-like exclamations, sometimes ending a key line with excited verbal punctuation. Her voice is technically proficient-- she sometimes recalls Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie-- but her main strength lies in how clearly her personality comes across in these songs. Whether she's giving voice to a maniac in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12646-sidewalk-safari/"" target=""_blank"">""Sidewalk Safari""</a> or gushing with love in ""I Belong in Your Arms"", Polachek sounds totally comfortable and in control.</p>
<p>Though it's obvious that Polachek is often singing from the vantage point of characters (we'd obviously have heard about it if she <i>actually</i> ran someone down in her car), the emphasis on emotion and relationships is key to <i>Something</i>'s success. It's notable that their debut's best song, ""Bruises"", was a straight-up love song, while the clunkiest tracks belabored conceits that felt self-consciously imposed on the music. The most resonant lines on <i>Something </i>are disarmingly direct: ""If I gave you what you're asking for, you know you wouldn't want it anymore,"" ""Does my love only count if it's proved?,"" ""My heart is beating fast and I wish that I knew why."" Polachek still indulges in high concept, but with more grace and nuance, as on ""Amanaemonesia"", where she meditates on the cultural and psychological power of healing rituals. She's even more successful on ""Guilty as Charged"", in which her verses lay out an elaborate trial metaphor that contrasts nicely with her cutting to the core of her character's emotional dilemma on the chorus.</p>
<p>The song on<i> Something</i> that gets me in the gut is ""I Belong in Your Arms"", a declaration of uncomplicated affection that makes the most of the band's embrace of faster tempos and open-hearted lyrics. Chairlift couldn't have pulled off a track like this back when they made pop music with scare quotes, footnotes, and caveats. But now that they've backed away from those defense mechanisms, they've allowed themselves to go all the way in expressing a powerful sentiment. There are many songs out there that echo the tone and message of ""I Belong in Your Arms"", but this one is no less joyous or affecting for lacking a unique concept. In cutting away their baggage and hang-ups, Chairlift have opened themselves up to writing truly great pop.</p>

Never mind that the beginnings of his catalog as <a href=""http://machinedrum.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Machinedrum</a> predate the genre's ongoing cultural flashpoint by a decade-- until his recent move to Berlin, the geographical space between him and the largely UK-based sound was vast. Ideologically, however, Stewart's attraction to bass music makes perfect sense. Over the past decade, he's subtly shifted from misty downtempo to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3384-prefuse-73/"" target=""_blank"">Prefuse 73</a>-reminiscent glitch-hop to the sort of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">Dilla</a>-fied beat ooze that refuses to go out of style. His 2010 release with the Glasgow label LuckyMe was titled <i>Many Faces</i>, and the title seemed apt. As a solo artist, Stewart doesn't like to stay in one place long.</p>
<p>As Andrew Gaerig put it in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16062-sepalcure/"" target=""_blank"">his review</a> of Stewart's fantastic debut LP with fellow producer Praveen Sharma (aka Braille) as Sepalcure, ""bass producers tend to treat innovation like daily prayer."" At one time, it would have been difficult to call Stewart as an innovator, but then he released last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15621-rooms/"" target=""_blank"">Room(s)</a></i> on the similarly hard-to-pin-down label Planet Mu. It was a heady, sensual trip through the smeared-vocal technique that most first encountered on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>'s 2007 breakthrough <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10877-untrue/"" target=""_blank"">Untrue</a></i>, incorporating the repetitive rhythmic kicks of footwork and coating it in atmosphere. The whole thing was an overwhelming swarm of sound, more in line with the maximalist trends in electronic music discussed in Simon Reynolds' recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8721-maximal-nation/"" target=""_blank"">""Maximal Nation"" </a>piece. Compared to the marbled elegance of <i>Sepalcure</i>, <i>Room(s)</i> is garish and cheeky, but you can't deny the album's utter audaciousness.</p>
<p>Relative to his work last year, Stewart's new EP on LuckyMe, <i>SXLND</i>, is a minor effort. Stylistically, the five songs on <i>SXLND</i> lie somewhere between Stewart's work on <i>Room(s)</i> and <i>Sepalcure</i>, with slight variations-- the former's clipped strangulations are backed by a spare, funky gallop on the title track, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12980-no-respect-ddd/"" target=""_blank"">""No Respect"" and closer ""DDD""</a> take the latter's smooth alleyway hymns out to the club, courtesy of a steady 4/4 thump. Instead of pushing things forward, he's making lateral moves.</p>
<p>The most notable thing about <i>SXLND</i> is the fact that its title track's serves as the backbone for rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29999-azealia-banks/"" target=""_blank"">Azealia Banks</a>' latest single, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13000-needsumluv/"" target=""_blank"">""NEEDSUMLUV""</a>. Heard here without her contribution, it indeed sounds like a backing track. And that's the main issue with <i>SXLND</i> as a whole: There aren't enough standalong tracks, just a collection of tunes that would sound great stuck in the middle of a solid DJ set (see, for instance, Stewart's <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2012/01/11/download-machinedrums-fader-mix/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent FADER mix</a>, where the EP's material hit much harder than when isolated here). So this is one for committed fans, those who've been following along with Stewart's recent renaissance and trying to guess what his next move will be.</p></div>"|16196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16196-sxlnd-ep/|6.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

Dag-Are Haugan and Espen Sommer Eide are electro-acoustic experimenters from Norway, and they've yet to step out from the dimly lit corners of the contemporary music avant-garde: They've never ""broken through,"" and at this point I doubt they ever will. Their music is not inaccessible, but it does play with the idea of what music itself can be, and they tend to avoid emotional manipulation. They present sound that is texturally rich and organized in an interesting way, but they're not telling you to feel happy or sad when you listen to it. All of which is to say that they are way down the list of abstract sound-makers likely to appeal to people who have a limited amount of space in their daily listening for abstract sound.</p>
<p>This is understandable, but it's also a shame, because Alog make wonderful music that sounds only better with time. <i>Unemployed</i>, their most recent album for Rune Grammofon, is very much a continuation of the arc of their previous records, meaning that it doesn't really sound like any of them. Every Alog record-- and indeed every track-- carves out its own space, and Haugan and Eide seem either incapable of or uninterested in repeating themselves. But while they don't have an overriding sonic signature, they do have some broad qualities that drive their approach to music. Their music is whimsical, frightening, sentimental, and atmospheric, often at the same time. On this album, they use location-based instrumental recordings, found sound, field recordings made on tour, and mix it all with studio work that blends samples and live instruments. These elements and approaches are fused together in such a way that you never really know which sound came from where. The result is music that feels open and free, which, for me, serves as a welcome reminder of how much my typical response to music is informed by idiom.</p>
<p>In general, there are two ideas that inform Alog's music. One the one hand you have playfulness. In the manner of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3563-the-residents/"" target=""_blank"">the Residents</a>, Alog's music has a strong sense of ""Let's try this and see what happens."" Tracks like ""Apeland"", which seems to be a recording of a gorgeous organ of some kind, but mic'd in such a way that the action on the keys produces both warm drones and a percussive tapping, feels like the product of setting up some microphones in a room and having fun with sound. ""Baklandet"" seems like a folk song of some kind, sung by a high voice that could be female, but the acoustic instruments are tweaked and messed with slightly, giving the pretty tune a destabilizing warble. ""Et Besok"", a simple exercise in the emotional possibilities of vocal processing, takes a voice and does strange things to it, balling it up in effects and then spreading it back out so it assumes a new shape.</p>
<p>When Alog aren't being playful, they're exploring the idea of music as ritual. In some cases, this comes out in their ear for layered and immersive drones that strike a balance between the electronic and the organic. Alog are good at making tracks that you can turn up and zone out to, tracks that feel like rooms to explore. And then sometimes they turn up the heat. The 17-minute ""Last Day at the Assembly Line"", which serves as the centerpiece of the record, is an exercise is tension and catharsis. It mixes caveman drum pounding, rapidly bowed strings that sound like gears grinding away in a machine, and, eventually, voices that chant and coo but favor sound over language. It's a terrifically powerful track that manages to evoke both stasis and decay, and it's continually either building up or falling apart. It definitely brings to mind krautrock, like a super-stripped-down version of the cultish mantras of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/198-amon-duul/"" target=""_blank"">Amon Dü</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/198-amon-duul/"" target=""_blank"">ü</a>l's <i>Psychedelic Underground</i>, but pulling out a term like ""krautrock"" doesn't quite make sense. Alog get me thinking about what music is and how it works on an almost molecular level, so familiar ""sounds like"" references feel beside the point. Their music is enjoyable for how it gets me thinking in addition to how it makes me feel. It returns me to that state of hearing something new and alien for the first time and wanting to know more.</p></div>"|16193.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16193-unemployed/|7.9|Mark Richardson

Lil B is not completely a different person now-- he's retained a good amount of the intense goofiness present in both ""Vans"" and its video-- but he's obviously mutated into a much different and more singular artist since his days with the Pack. The song's producer, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/youngl"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Young L</a> (he also raps the third verse), has also grown into his own since ""Vans"". But where Lil B's turned into a bizarre rap savant, L has stuck to the slaps of hyphy that were the song's backbone, gravitating toward construction and sounds that are less pop and more outwardly showy, with rapping that often sounds like it's merely cruising along for the ride.</p>
<p>This has presented a bit of a problem at times for Young L, who, across various mixtapes in the past few years, has hit on some great tracks but generally had trouble matching the quality of his rapping to the quality of his producing. With <i>Praktica</i>, his most recent tape, he comes as close as ever to accomplishing that, and the result is a record that feels for the first time like he's found the formula for making consistently good solo songs. His rapping is still more about charisma, charm, and knowing how to ride his own beats than about lyrics, and the one song here that's tagged as a freestyle is indistinguishable from everything else on the tape. His rapping is both dumb and <span class=""s1""><a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=go%20dumb"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dumb</a></span>, and it's a style that works for him here because there's a youthful brashness and confidence in his delivery, something that allows L to sell his rapping without coming off as trying too hard.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn't hurt that the beats are uniformly great. L's production has always been spare, heavy on keyboard beeps, and equally reliant on bass and open space. On <i>Praktica </i>he cannibalizes sounds from <i>Mario</i> and <i>Pac-Man</i> in a way that is inspired and novel instead of gimmicky. At a crucially digestible nine tracks, there is no overextension of the idea, and the sounds of classic video games are so harmonious with the production style Young L's cultivated that you wouldn't even bat an eye if the samples he pulls weren't so immediately identifiable. As befits an internet-savvy artist who had a hit song in his teens and also owns his own clothing line, L has always seemed filled to the brim with ideas, and the tricks he pulls on songs like ""Arcade Pussy"" and ""Super Nintendo"" are some of his best yet.</p>
<p>There is still something very raw about <i>Praktica</i>, and L in general, that will turn some people off, and you almost have to be willing to approach his verses as if they're choruses-- where small phrases and snatches of melody will embed themselves in your head-- to fully appreciate his rapping. But there is something undeniably kinetic about this cocky, self-assured artist honing his sound and skill level that helps make up for much of the tape's shortcomings. There may be a disappointing 20-track tape on the way, but if L continues in this direction, we may bizarrely look back on ""Vans"" as the breeding ground for a few of the most distinctive young voices in West Coast hip-hop.</p></div>"|16195.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16195-praktica/|7.1|Jordan Sargent

Like his fellow West Country dweller <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>, Vibert appears to have a dearth of unreleased material yet to see the light of day. These days most musicians and music fans have some form of useless archive-- the simultaneous rise of the mp3 and computer-based sequencing software guaranteed that a surfeit of recorded music would lay dormant on hard drives across the globe. Back when Vibert was starting out, at some point in the early 1990s, he seems to have been a digital junk soothsayer, amassing a great body of work while the rest of us were tooling away on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_(online_service)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prodigy</a> message boards and getting to grips with AOL for DOS. Unlike the rest of ours, his binary debris actually seems to have some value.</p>
<p>In 1995, Vibert released a series of EPs under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3339-plug/"">Plug</a>, which served as a catchall moniker to present his typically twisted take on drum'n'bass. An album, <i>Drum 'n' Bass for Papa</i>, followed a year later, around the time he was being courted by major labels. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6209-trent-reznor/"">Trent Reznor</a>'s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nothing Records</a> released <i>Drum 'n' Bass for Papa </i>in the U.S., handily packaging it with the prior EPs. As the popularity of the genre waned, Vibert wisely bailed on Plug, instead choosing one of his many other aliases to work under. But he couldn't shake what once seemed like a one-off fudging of popular genre tropes. In 2006, an EP titled <i>Here It Comes </i>emerged, comprising four unreleased Plug tracks. Now we've got another clearing of the vaults, this time in the shape of a full-length LP comprised of Plug recordings Vibert made from 1995-1998.</p>
<p>The original Plug records skirted under the radar of most serious drum'n'bass heads. It lacked the pile-driving ferocity of most <a href=""http://www.metalheadz.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Metalheadz</a> releases and/or the jazz-tinged seriousness of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Looking_Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Good Looking</a>'s output. There were other shades of drum'n'bass, of course, but very few of them touched on humor, which remains a common touchstone for many of Vibert's projects. It's unlikely he was looking to hold down a residency at the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Blue-Note-Hoxton/146568342096879?sk=info"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blue Note</a> in pre-hip Hoxton (ironically, the same venue where his current label, <a href=""http://ninjatune.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ninja Tune</a>, hosted their legendary Stealth nights). Instead, he always seemed happiest working in his own sphere, which, for Plug, meant blurring the lines between the bloodless white-knuckle ride of drum'n'bass and the easy listening boom that was gathering pace around the mid 1990s.</p>
<p><i>Back on Time</i> is barely separable from <i>Drum 'n' Bass for Papa</i>; it's essentially more of the same. Vibert's breakbeats still writhe and skitter, methodically contorted around his eccentric choice of samples. On ""A Quick Plug for a New Slot"", a lumbering beat slugs lethargically into the mix before a pinging sitar line forces everything to lurch into a sprightlier clip. The excellently titled ""Come on My Skeleton"" feels like it's straining under the weight of its own excesses, with fat slabs of industrialized sound vying with twists of an opera singer climbing up into her higher range. The latter ends with Vibert pulling a rabbit out of the hat in the form of a straight-laced man claiming, ""you might also become aware of your anus or genitalia."" Even on this older material he's an expert at diffusing tension in that way, always ready with a banana peel to slip under the mix in case things are getting a little too serious.</p>
<p>That pranksterish approach is the point where most people either get on or off board with Vibert. On <i>Back on Time</i>, it works to his advantage, largely thanks to his ability to balance out his humorous inclinations with an unnerving ability to sequence it all over an impressively brutal infrastructure. On ""Back on Time"" he's able to filter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29423-john-barry/"">John Barry</a>-esque string parts through indecipherable vocal bellowing and a beat that floods the mix with its tinny timbre. Even the relatively subdued ""Mind Bending"" ends up stacked high with junk, with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_(toy)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Speak &amp; Spell</a>-style speech synthesis vying for space with jerky analog loops and a wild-eyed raver shouting, ""fucking excellent acid house."" That form of maximal japery foreshadows the work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"">Rustie</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"">James Ferraro</a>, partially explaining why this material sounds fresh again. It's a kitchen sink-like flood of sound, always on the verge of resembling a gigantic curveball being forced down your throat, but with Vibert pulling back from the humor brink at all the right moments.</p></div>"|16184.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16184-back-on-time/|6.5|Nick Neyland

In 2003, Dear's wonky vocal anthem, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOecv01Ymys"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dog Days""</a>, could have been taken as a micro-house producer's novelty, a cheeky attempt at merging sappy indie pop with alien sound design. But while he kept on recording ""straight"" techno in a bewildering array of styles, Dear's records under his own name continued shucking dance music's rules, rhythmic and otherwise.  Techno's precision kept his Afrobeat and art-funk fixations from devolving into jam-band aimlessness. And lessons learned from those genres made his machine textures appealingly strange, rather than preset bland. The four song <i>Headcage</i> EP both picks up where Dear's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14533-black-city/"" target=""_blank"">last record</a> left off and shakes its influence enough to suggest where he might be headed next.</p>
<p>Or maybe not. Like any good techno producer, Dear appreciates the EP as an artform in itself, rather than a way to rush out a set of not-too-dissimilar songs to keep fans happy between albums. That said, it might also be the least ""techno"" material Dear's recorded. Two of the songs verge on a kind of singer-songwriter's ambient, floating by with almost no backing at all. A third sounds like a sensitive rocker got hold of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29609-soulja-boy/"" target=""_blank"">Soulja Boy</a> track and decided to make the best of it, with winning results. This is Dear as laid-back charmer, rather than forbidding electro architect. Compared to the dark (but not bleak) journey of 2010's <i>Black City</i>, where Dear transposed the ""nighttime drive"" claustrophobia of old-school techno to a set of intricate almost-rock jams, <i>Headcage</i> shakes off the late-night jitters for a sound so airy it threatens to evaporate into murmurs and empty space.</p>
<p><i>Black City'</i>s density suggested that Dear was drawing aesthetic energy from what most of us would just suffer as the stress of living in a tightly packed urban environment. Here he seems to be yearning for the room to chill. The dark electro of <i>Headcage</i>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12869-headspace/"" target=""_blank"">title cut</a>, vaguely reminiscent of various early-1980s British synth-pop bands without quite sounding like anyone specific, might inititally trick you into thinking the EP will be the afterparty to <i>Black City'</i>s bash. But Dear relaxes into something more comfortable and blissful as <i>Headcage</i> plays out, suggesting two possible routes for his music in the future. ""In the Middle (I Met You There)"" is one of the most surprising cuts Dear's put his name to since ""Dog Days"", a love song crooned (by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28199-the-drums/"" target=""_blank"">the Drums</a>' Jonny Pierce) over a bright hip-hop loop, not too dissimilar from the 8-bit fizz being peddled by producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>, that he fleshes out with shifting layers of keyboard buzz. It's as delightful-- chillwave with actual hooks and a sound rich enough to swim in instead of just wash over you-- as it is unexpected.</p>
<p>But ""Street Song"" and ""Around a Fountain"" do away with anything as coarse as drums, unless a flicker of static repurposed as a rhythm counts, suggesting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a> at their most amorphous and then taking it even further. (Though given that Dear's always sung like this, it's an interesting question as to who got there first.) It's hard to imagine Dear constructing an entire LP out of such seemingly insubstantial stuff, but he might just be able to pull it off. Even in this beatless world, he brings his techno producer's instincts out, dropping just enough in the way of fleeting, right-place-right-time hooks to catch your ear when it's ready drift away from the song. It's a good example of how a grounding in ""functional"" dance would do a lot of avant-rockers a world of good.</p></div>"|16194.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16194-headcage-ep/|6.8|Jess Harvell

A passing glance at the state of British mainstream radio neatly illustrates how it's shifted for bands of their ilk: When Snow Patrol inked a deal with Polydor's Fiction imprint in 2002, Steve Lamacq still lorded over evenings on Radio 1. His ""Evening Session"" show was where I first taped songs by bands like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiV1DtfKXAA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Idlewild</a>, Snow Patrol, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDA9TQMdtP4&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seafood</a>.</p>
<p>Tune in tonight between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., and you're more likely to catch Guetta or Skrillex than an ""indie"" pop band. It's pretty much the same during the day, when hyperactive bass music and loud, super-compressed pop music hold court. You might think bands like Coldplay, Snow Patrol, and Elbow would be beyond trying to square up to that world, but Coldplay ushered in some subtle shades of R&amp;B production on last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15953-mylo-xyloto/"" target=""_blank"">Mylo Xyloto</a>, </i>and on <i>Fallen Empires</i> Snow Patrol pick at similar threads with electronic touches of their own.</p>
<p>That change in direction is evident on opener ""I'll Never Let Go"" as arpeggiated synth notes open and then carry the entire song. The build from there is slow-- growing as distorted guitars throw weight into the chorus-- but the song reaches ridiculous proportions when folk-pop singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29104-lissie/"" target=""_blank"">Lissie</a> provides gospel singing toward the finale (warning: she pops up on an additional <i>three</i> songs). You get the sense they're shooting for something epic, something that would sound just as big as the pop bangers on radio, but the results are goofy.</p>
<p>Electronics appear heavily on another four songs, enough for the band to describe the album as a showcase for their ""<a href=""http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/music-news/2009/10/15/exclusive-snow-patrol-star-gary-lightbody-reveeals-truth-behind-go-kart-crash-injury-86908-21748692/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">secret love of Techno</a>."" Listening to those songs, it seems less the product of five guys who secretly listen to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c5RCbc_TPg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michael Mayer</a> backstage before playing to 10,000 people, and more like somebody who might enjoy the techno preset demo on a Yamaha keyboard.</p>
<p>They sound more at ease in the second half of the record, returning to the territory of big ballads and acoustic guitars. That portion of the album's ushered in by ""Berlin"", a charming instrumental that sounds more like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azGIf74ICmw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sufjan Stevens</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6HjT4SQKJI&amp;feature=fvwrel"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jónsi</a> (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G-cqAehehA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Owen Pallett</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axVLPk-U6ps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nico Muhly</a> provided arrangements here and elsewhere). Less edgy, sure, but signifiers like that are a much better fit for a band that has always had a knack for big arrangements.</p>
<p>Songs like ""Lifening"" and ""New York"" bludgeon with sentiment, but one of these per record could probably keep Snow Patrol in business for life on rom-com movie scores alone. They're the exact kind of home runs you get the feeling Snow Patrol could hit in their sleep. Which makes you wonder if, in the future, instead of toying with awkward electronics they might be better served sticking to what they already do pretty effectively. I mean, nobody's going to have <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSeNSzJ2-Jw&amp;feature=relmfu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skrillex</a> as the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=snow+patrol+wedding&amp;oq=snow+patrol+wedding&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=0l0l0l15638l0l0l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first dance at their wedding</a>.</p></div>"|16178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16178-snow-patrol-fallen-empires/|4.8|Hari Ashurst

And no, it is almost certainly not any version of the band that existed after 1970, though there were quite a few of them. There are good songs sprinkled through the latter-Kinks discography, sometimes even in generous clusters, but the band almost everyone means when they say ""The Kinks"" is really ""The Kinks in the 1960s."" Sanctuary's new <i>Kinks in Mono</i> box collects the entirety of the band's 60s output, in mono, as the title implies, and in that respect, it's a can't-miss collector's item.</p>
<p>The music from this period of the band is unimpeachable, so really the question that surrounds a release like this is: Who needs it? If you're in any way prone to dropping $150 on a Kinks boxed set, there is a pretty good chance you already own all this music, and if you bought the individual album reissues Sanctuary released in 2011, you already have the albums in mono, because those reissues included both stereo and mono versions on separate discs (except for <i>The Kink Kontroversy</i>, which has only ever been available in mono). To be fair, it's a well-designed package clearly created with a lot of love, and it does augment the band's first seven albums with three discs of mostly essential EP and non-album 45 tracks, but this, too, does little to distinguish it from those earlier releases, which were generously appointed with bonus material.</p>
<p>There is a reason that the Kinks' catalog is so constantly revisited, of course-- its quality and enduring appeal pretty much ensure that record labels will be finding new ways to carve up the band's legacy and repackage it as long as people are willing to buy it in some sort of physical form. They established themselves early with their energy and their shredded-amp heaviness. Their albums, EPs, and singles from 1964 and 1965 are the most uneven included here, but the good stuff is really, really good. The punky, distorted guitars on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk3Ei_yoI4c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Really Got Me""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMWNwHof0kc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All Day and All of the Night""</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y96iiKgBuU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Need You""</a> are still thrilling, and there are a lot of relative obscurities worth listening back to, from the sharp Merseybeat of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siPILCkScSk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Still Want Me""</a> to Dave Davies' slow and yearning ""I Am Free"".</p>
<p>The thing about listening to all of this band's 60s output at once is that it shows a very clearly and incremental progression from that material to the establishment of the band's signature identity as the British rock scene's foremost appreciators of English life. While almost every other songwriter working in a rock band at the time was talking about altered states or sticking it to squares, Ray Davies developed a vocabulary of traditional English life, and even mocked Carnaby Street fashion on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxYGOSSj9A0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dedicated Follower of Fashion""</a>. The Kinks were culture without the ""counter"" prefix, a rock band that anomalously acknowledged the dignity in the middle-aged woman who went out and bought a hat like the one Princess Marina wore, the one that adopted the mannerisms of music hall without pastiche or irony, the one that sang about tea and gooseberry tarts and favoring neighborhood life over new patterns of development.</p>
<p>The band's 60s output culminated in <i>Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)</i>, a sweeping panorama of a post-war Britain that had lost its long-cherished identity, a portrait of a family about to be separated by a hemisphere's worth of ocean as the son and his wife move to Australia, leaving behind the title character to keep calm and carry on. I love psychedelia and teenage rebellion, but I get the sense that a whole lot more people lived in the England Ray Davies wrote about than in the one everyone else sang about. We're trained to think of things like Antonioni's <i>Blow-Up</i> as the definitive portraits of London in the 60s, but that's just part of the story. Arthur standing on the dock is just as big a part, if not bigger.</p>
<p>You'd be hard-pressed to find a more sensitive extended document of this England than you can hear on this set. Whether you need to unload your wallet for it is another story. If you like the 60s Kinks but don't own any of their music and want to, well, here you go. You can't go wrong, and they're a band that presents well in mono. There's little in the way of audio experimentation on their records, and even their densest recordings, especially on <i>Arthur</i>, don't need the added depth of a stereo picture to succeed brilliantly (the mono versions are uniformly better in the car, for instance). So yes, the music's as brilliant as it ever was, and it's all here, well-housed. The only question is whether that's enough.</p></div>"|16161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16161-kinks-in-mono/|8.5|Joe Tangari

Play some for a cynic, and short of outright disapproval, you'll probably be greeted with a categorical response: ""I could do that, too."" There are a handful of mostly irrefutable ways to come back at that idea-- ""Well, you didn't,"" for instance, or, ""OK, tell me how."" But don't be so snappy, not yet: Noise music, at least for me, should retain some element of mystery, some air of unknowing; after all, if it's an intentional obliteration of the structures and sounds you've known from the first time you heard ""Electric Company"" or ""Sesame Street"", it should force you to ask the most basic questions of what it is, how it is made, and why it is made. And in the quest for those illusory answers, the best noise, drone, and sound experimentation should either pull you in or blow you away, reaffirming that the thing itself is more provocative than the motions behind it.</p>
<p>This is all to say that <i>Freermasonry-- </i>the obliterative sixth album from Wold, the Saskatchewan act led by the incredibly named Fortress Crookedjaw-- is ultimately enigmatic and entirely unknowable, an intersection of noise, metal, and electronics that doesn't yield to such plainclothes criticism. Mean, dense and multivalent, with a lyrical conceit based on Masonic symbolism and Biblical scripture, it's the rare loud music that begs to be louder still if you're to have any chance of understanding it. <i>Freermasonry</i> is a case study in controlling the illusion of chaos, an elegantly constructed nightmare of sound where hearing one layer of serrated screams, static bursts, and feedback flares means you've missed some mass of activity somewhere else. Weirdly seductive rhythms tumble beneath a laundromat of blown-out tones and crackling vocals, generally pulling your attention a dozen different ways.</p>
<p>I've been listening to the album consistently for three months now, and somehow, I'm still surprised by what its 58 minutes sound like and accomplish. Paradoxically disorienting and direct,<i> Freermasonry</i> is a constant tumult of surprising activity, more unforgiving than most everything in the noise, metal, and drone scenes, places where Wold kind of fits. It's not an album you casually hear and dismiss by saying, ""Oh, yeah, I could've made this."" (Even defining the ""this"" is hard enough.) Remember how those backwards rock'n'hits sounded vaguely demonic? Imagine those sounding truly malevolent, but with solid structure, buried subtlety, and an ideology developed well past the point of boogeyman Satanism.</p>
<p><i>Freermasonry</i> isn't Wold's most damaging effort; the slyly named 2010 disc <i>Working Together For Our Privacy</i> turned three songs into a 35-minute suffocation, where an instantaneous deluge of distortion squashes everything beneath. About 2008's torturous <i>Stratification</i>, Wold member <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/7511-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank"">Obey once said</a>, ""We transmogrified the idea of our soundscape to fit the notion of an unrelenting winter storm."" This time, Wold actually make some concessions to cohesive album flow, beginning with the two-minute garble ""Opening"" and always putting a relatively short track (be that three or six minutes) between 11- and 12-minute strangleholds. With its faulty click-clack rhythm and mix of lascivious and lugubrious lyrics, the strangely alluring ""Dry Love"" essentiallly sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave/"" target=""_blank"">Cold Cave</a> with its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"" target=""_blank"">Prurient</a> component grossly amplified. With its disruptive subdural bass and five-verse structure about ""bloody crescent moons,"" ""Annex Axe"" even suggests dubstep (think Coki) ground down by a blender. Similarly accessible moments dot <i>Freermasonry</i>, from the jumbled dance that starts the closing title track to the rock-like eruption that begins ""SOL"".</p>
<p>But don't take those references as hints that Wold are somehow taking it easy; rather, these moments of relief or familiarity simply make everything else that much more punishing, so that, when the beat all but disappears on the title track after several minutes, you actually mourn it. This album always peaks at its most extreme, especially with a series of three long, harsh sermons of invective-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12557-free-goat-of-leviticus/"" target=""_blank"">""Free Goat of Leviticus""</a>, ""Dragon Owl Didactisism"", and ""Working Tools for Praxis"". With quoted Scripture and a developed revisionist theology, these tracks harangue definitive Biblical heroes, positing that ""Peter epitomizes the sadomasochistic spirit of the New Covenant"" and, later, ""Lucifer… is a better tomorrow and the bringer of a future."" The sound matches the spirit perfectly, with three-dimensional folds of splintering static and garbled lines creating an anxiety strong enough to shake any beliefs.</p></div>"|16147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16147-freermasonry/|8.3|Grayson Currin

With beefier production values that pointed more directly toward trance and euphoric house, it was undoubtedly the most complete and confident thing the Denver producer's created to date. But never a stranger to the internet, Egedy's free download series, <i>Dimensional Rip</i>, has played host to a handful of jumbled, messy mixes, and the seventh installment is a full-blown <i>Thee Physical </i>remix album.</p>
<p>Well, sort of: It depends on how you define ""album."" Only five of <i>Thee Physical</i>'s 11 originals are given the remix treatment, and they're plopped down as an unordered clump of beats. I'm not sure how we're supposed to listen to this; on my mp3 player, they're sorted alphabetically, meaning three remixes of ""Body Mod"" are followed by a whopping seven reworks of lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15928-post-physical/"" target=""_blank"">""Post Physical""</a>-- it's not the most measured playlist I've ever heard. In my iTunes, however, the tracks are assorted seemingly randomly, splitting up the monotony but throwing in a whole lot of volatile randomness. So as much as we might want to call <i>Dimensional Rip 7</i> an album, in practice it's merely a collection of tracks for us to peruse and choose from.</p>
<p>Even though the production values of <i>Thee Physical</i> seemed to pull Egedy away from the kind of homemade dance music made from big obvious samples (such as 2009's memorable<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11365-goth-star/"" target=""_blank""> ""Goth Star""</a>), its remix companion hands the album over to a whole spectrum of DIY denizens, from recognizable to obscure names. The results vary in quality just as much. For as many that simply aren't distinctive, there's a number of cringe-worthy facepalms. Chicago's Fire For Effect seize on the slow, belaboured theatricality of ""Post Physical"", turning it into something saccharine and overblown, while the less said about Craxxxmurf's headache-inducing take on ""Touching Transform"" the better. <i>Dimensional Rip 7</i>'s sheer size has one advantage, however: For every misstep there's a good remix lurking behind it. Ritualz's ""Alien Trance remix"" of ""Post Physical"" takes hold of the trance thread that weaves through Egedy's work and turns it rubbery and warped, while Adeptus lay down a bed of lush synths and acid gurgles, turning ""Trancegender"" into the aching duet with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"" target=""_blank"">Zola Jesus</a> it should have been in the first place.</p>
<p><i>Dimensional Rip 7 </i>features some prominent and well-timed guests, too. Montreal woman-of-the-moment Grimes dismantles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15834-real-is-a-feeling/"" target=""_blank"">""Real Is a Feeling""</a> and reconstructs it into one of her own pins-and-needles skeletons, infusing the track with her breathy coos for a remix so delicate it almost sounds out of place on a package full of speaker-blown hymns to homemade dance music. But the crown jewel undoubtedly belongs to makeshift chop'n'screw master Physical Therapy. The New Jersey producer's own distinct style-- taking huge samples and inflating them until they're puffy clouds of distortion and then drenching everything in sad, defeated, lean-dripping slowdown-- is more than compatible with Pictureplane's, and his take on ""Post Physical"" layers sirens, heavy metallic breaks, and the original's stirring synth riff. It's one of the collection's few moments that feels truly innovative, one of the American underground's weirdest personalities putting his imprint on another bizarro underdog.</p>
<p>That inspiring collaboration sits atop a veritable heap of information-overload excess, and a project as cheeky but quietly ambitious as Pictureplane deserves nothing less than a sprawling song-vomit remix album. Like most of what he does, it's far from tasteful and not always all that great, but the highlights are some of the most fun and carefree electronic music from this side of the Atlantic. There's been a lot of talk about the American ""new rave generation"" fueled by artists like Skrillex and Deadmau5, but it's really Pictureplane that embodies everything caricatured in images of those neon-clad teenagers. Honestly, <i>Dimensional Rip 7</i> is a complete mess and not even close to a coherent listening experience, but its highs are high enough to make wading through the mud a worthwhile endeavor.</p></div>"|16192.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16192-dimensional-rip-7-thee-physical-remixes/|5.0|Andrew Ryce

His involvement, along with the fact that they are dating, will inform the way many people approach the record, especially since it finds Edwards striking in some new musical directions. After building three albums on a sturdy country-rock Canadiana frame, she jettisons the bar-band guitars and twangy vocals in favor of a bigger sound marked by gauzy production and a fuller band that includes Vernon along with members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7129-megafaun/"" target=""_blank"">Megafaun</a>, Francis &amp; the Lights, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28827-peter-wolf-crier/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Wolf Crier</a>.</p>
<p>It still sounds like an Edwards album, but it's not hard to hear Vernon's influence. It's there in his yawping vocals on ""Chameleon/Comedian"" and in the bicycle bell on ""Going to Hell"", a sound that's quickly becoming his signature. And he may well be present in the lyrics, which chronicle not the end of one relationship and the start of another. The latter is most evident on the album's most upbeat song, ""Sidecar"", which evokes the dizzy excitement of new love, chronicling nothing more momentous than a whole day spent together. So <i>Voyageur</i> is both a break-up and a hook-up record; it's less about relationships than the spaces in between, where regret over the past and worry over the future can overlap and overwhelm.</p>
<p>Accordingly, there's more drama and dynamism in these songs than in her past work, as Edwards reshapes her sound to accommodate those themes. Instead of the guitar solos and full-band jams that sounded like genre accessories, she gives over more space to more complex instrumental passages that build or fade theatrically. Some listeners may ascribe such moments on ""Mint"" and ""Change the Sheets"" to her new collaborators, but Edwards was examining these ideas on 2008's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11303-asking-for-flowers/"" target=""_blank"">Asking for Flowers</a></i>, an album that rethought the inner workings of her songs while still grounding them in hardscrabble country music.</p>
<p>That record wasn't as ambitious as <i>Voyageur</i>, but it was rawer, rougher, and better. In fact, Edwards often sounds lost in these new songs. She has a great voice-- dusty and rambunctious-- and she still knows how to bend or break a note to add almost unbearable gravity to a particular line or phrase, but the new material asks her to strain her vocals uncomfortably, especially when she's singing wordlessly during those instrumental passages. Generally, she's keener on sensical lyrics than on voice-as-sound; she's an interpreter, so the meanings of words often inform her delivery. On ""Mint"" and ""Going to Hell"", her voice loses much of its personality without lyrics to guide her.</p>
<p>Thematically, these new musical avenues fit the lyrics nicely: Each song emphasizes change and risk, and Edwards never resorts to tired sentiments or platitudes about healing and hope. On the other hand, she does entertain a particularly tortured, hell-in-a-handbasket metaphor on ""Going to Hell"" and writes a few clunkers on ""Change the Sheets"" (""Change the sheets and then change me""). That is as new and startling as any sound on the album, as in the past Edwards has proved to be a very careful songwriter who made every line count. But <i>Voyageur </i>is her most traditionally confessional album, and while that might allow other singer-songwriters a bit more gravity and urgency, here the more intimate focus limits her lyrical range and stunts the album's impact.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's a question of perspective. Edwards has written convincingly and often devastatingly about other people, attempting to view the world from the point of view of an abducted girl, a haggard housewife, or a woman carrying the baby of a criminal. That empathic endeavor lent her songs real bite, allowing her to sum up an entire life in a few well-chosen words. But on <i>Voyageur</i>, Edwards seems to get outside herself, never tries to get another angle on any particular issue, which saps the songs of their humor as well as their imaginative power.</p></div>"|16176.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16176-voyageur/|6.4|Stephen M.

In light of this anecdote, his ongoing mentorship of Penboyr-raised/Cardiff-based avant-pop chanteuse <a href=""http://catelebon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cate Le Bon</a> amounts to more than just an elder statesman lending support to the next great Welsh hope; rather, in Le Bon, he presumably hears the genuine realization of that mistaken assumption. While Le Bon's cool, disaffected voice was <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4lZqDmCO9c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a natural fit for Rhys' electro-fied side project, Neon Neon</a>, the music she creates under her own name more closely resembles <i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i> relocated from Warhol's Factory to a Welsh farmhouse, displaying an equal affinity for narcotic melodies and jangle-riff repetition, but with the East Village grime replaced by a certain lambswool coziness.</p>
<p>Like many debut albums by folk-schooled solo artists trying to assert their identity, Le Bon's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14218-me-oh-my/"" target=""_blank"">Me Oh My</a></i> (released in 2009 on Rhys' Irony Bored Records label), could come off as both whimsically precious (""Sad Sad Feet"") and state-of-the-world serious (""Terror of the Man""), but showed a willingness to disrupt its serene surroundings with cutting lyrical barbs and well-timed blasts of psychedelicized guitar fuzz. The follow-up, <i>CYRK</i>, does little to upset Le Bon's pastoral, turn-of-the-1970s prog-pop alchemy (as she sang on <i>Me Oh My</i>, ""I like what I like and I like what I know""), but as its title-- the Polish word for ""circus""-- indicates, it's several degrees more playful and irreverent.</p>
<p>Where <i>Me Oh My</i> tended to reveal its charms and idiosyncrasies gradually, <i>CYRK</i> lets its guard down almost immediately with ""Falcon Eyed"", a scrappy, start-stop gallop that suggests Le Bon has been trading pen-pal notes with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1602-the-fiery-furnaces/"" target=""_blank"">the Fiery Furnaces</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8565-eleanor-friedberger/"" target=""_blank"">Eleanor Friedberger</a>. The song's punkish drive proves anomalous to what follows, but its mischievous energy carries through to <i>CYRK</i>'s statelier turns as, much more so than on <i>Me Oh My</i>, Le Bon uses her deadpan delivery to droll effect. She takes particular delight in infusing innocent, golden-oldies-radio sounds with decidedly unromantic sentiment: ""Puts Me to Work"" is an ode to domestic unrest and ennui that nonetheless boasts all the sweetness and grace of the first-dance selection at a wedding, while ""The Man I Wanted"" finds her communicating desire for her one and only through a catatonic stare, before opportunistically asking him, ""Where is the payout?""</p>
<p>But more than just chart her progression as a singer and songwriter, <i>CYRK</i> also sees Le Bon and her four-piece band developing into a crack psych-rock outfit that consistently leads the songs into unexpected places, from the wiggy guitar jams that overtake the title track and ""Fold the Cloth"", to the piano-rolled clamor on ""Through the Mill"" that sounds like a haunted house coming alive after dark. Tellingly, the closing two-part suite ""Ploughing Out"" serves as an autobiographical testament to LeBon's personal and musical evolution, beginning as low-key lullaby referencing her country roots and then yielding to an anthemic, acid-rockin' celebration of escape (""we'll be on the last boat out of here,"" she repeats excitedly) that spirals into joyous, saxophone-fired cacophony. Le Bon's days as a farmgirl in northern Wales may be long behind her, but she's clearly held on to certain agricultural principles: namely, that the right amounts of patience and nurturing can produce glorious yields.</p></div>"|16179.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16179-cate-le-bon/|7.6|Stuart Berman

Even in rap music, where 90  percent of musical arguments begin and end with side-choosing and  insult-hurling, <a href=""http://www.lupefiasco.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lupe</a> is a lightning rod. What has he done to  deserve such scorn? What has he done to warrant such blind devotion? The answer to both  questions, unfortunately, is ""not enough"": Lupe's so gifted that he remains nearly impossible to tune out completely, but his career is a sad little parable about the danger of wasted talent.</p>
<p>Perhaps he can sense this perception in the air. Because like most rappers who've made promises to the conscious-rap crowd that they have no intention of keeping, Lupe's music has grown increasingly sour, half-assed, and  defensive as he's traveled further from the glow of his Chosen One days.  Listening to <i>Friend of the People</i>, his wearying, dispiriting latest mixtape, you don't leave with the warm and fuzzy  feeling promised in the title; you come away thinking that Lupe's  underlying message these days feels closer to, ""Here you are, you ungrateful motherfuckers; I've given you something else beautiful to tear apart.""</p>
<p><i>Friend  of the People</i> comes out a little more than a year after Lupe's last mixtape, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13794-enemy-of-the-state-a-love-story/"" target=""_blank"">Enemy of the State</a></i>, but if there's a thematic link between them, it's beyond a dog's range of hearing. <i>Enemy of the State </i>was short, punchy, and highly enjoyable; for a third of <i>Friend of the People</i>, you feel actively punished for paying attention. Part of the problem is beat selection: On <i>Enemy</i>, he skip-roped nimbly over Radiohead's ""The National Anthem"" without embarrassing anybody, but on <i>Friend</i>'s ""Lupe Back"", he allows UK bro-step goons Nero to assault us with endless, bowel-loosening bass drops. Fiasco sneaks in some eyebrow-raising rap-industry jabs-- producer deals, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Broadcast_Data_Systems"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">B.D.S.</a>, ""only as hot as your last beat""-- but they disappear in the chaos.</p>
<p>Production has always been an Achilles' heel for Lupe: He's nimble enough to make you listen to him rapping over anything, but his tin ear tests this hypothesis far too frequently. Mainstream, aggressively macho dubstep seems to be his latest thing: Besides Nero, we get Bassnectar's remix  of Ellie Goulding's ""Lights"" for ""Lightworks"" and alpha-bro Skrillex on ""SNDCLSH in Vegas"". Lupe throws every flow he's got against these  steel-beamed, charmless corporate-office structures, but his reedy voice slides harmlessly right off. He also goes out of his way to show us  he's keeping up with indie, sampling ""On'n'On"" from Justice's garish hockey-prog <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15966-audio-video-disco/"" target=""_blank"">new album</a>, and skimming some starry-eyed shimmer off the top of M83's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12263-midnight-city/"" target=""_blank"">""Midnight City""</a>. I couldn't help but wish he would stop straining and find some tracks that work as viable rap beats.</p>
<p>There  are fleeting moments on <i>Friend of the People</i> where  he encourages you to look past all these problems. ""Joaquin Phoenix"" is full of head-turning lines, both self-deprecating (""Fitted hat is Reynolds  wrap/ Because I don't trust the government"") and silly (""You be on that  glory hole/ You don't know who you fuckin' with""). On the page, when he's engaged, Lupe is invincible. Even his quasi-philosophical nonsense comes with a poetic touch-- ""Atheism's cheaper and accepts Visa"" might not mean anything, but it's a sharply turned, gnomic phrase. He even drops an incredible floss rhyme on ""Supercold"" just to show us he can: ""Christmastime diamonds singing carols on my chest/ Step up off the jet, lookin' like a pharaoh in the flesh."" But he's just as likely to waste our time recounting the plots to 1990s gangsta movies (""Double Burger w/Cheese""). It cuts to the core of Lupe's problem: there's almost nothing he can't do. Sadly, he never does anything much.</p></div>"|16186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16186-lupe-fiasco-friend-of-the-people/|4.8|Jayson Greene

For nearly a decade, the band-- a burly, ultra-technical instrumental-metal outfit with members split between Raleigh, N.C. and Richmond, Va.-- lurked in the shadows like some cryptozoological beast glimpsed only in a handful of tantalizing photographs. Prior to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12957-loincloth-iron-balls-of-steel/"" target=""_blank"">Iron Balls of Steel</a></i>, Loincloth's complete discography totaled four songs, lasting a few seconds shy of 12 minutes.</p>
<p>But there was magic in those tracks (first issued on a 2003 CD-R demo, with two of the selections also appearing on a Southern Lord 7"" and a third on a Swami Records comp), which subjected majestic doom to merciless rhythmic dislocation. Their resolute rawness was like a stop sign held up against better-known technical-metal bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2745-meshuggah/"" target=""_blank"">Meshuggah</a>, whose complexity is tempered by mechanistic coldness. In this one brief dispatch, Loincloth proved that it was possible for metal's essential caveman-ness to coexist with its burgeoning brainiac impulses. Yet for all their musical conviction, Loincloth seemed ambivalent at best about their bandhood; the quartet never emerged for even a single live gig, and for years, an ill-maintained <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/fuckfalsemetal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MySpace page</a> was all that signified their existence. It seemed reasonable to conclude that Loincloth's hibernation was permanent.</p>
<p>Late 2011 brought bittersweet news: A Loincloth LP was finally due, but for reasons they're <a href=""http://heavymetal.about.com/od/loincloth/a/Loincloth.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">keeping private</a>, the band had completed it without guitarist Pen Rollings, a key presence on the demo and a cult-hero avant-metal artisan known for his work in the head-spinning early math-rock trio Breadwinner. Rollings had helped bolster the Loincloth legend via a hilariously outspoken <span class=""s1""><a href=""http://www.chunklet.com/index.cfm?section=article&amp;IssueID=2&amp;ID=37"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chunklet interview</a></span>, in which he mocked Norwegian black metal's humorless facade (a sentiment expressed on the demo via the track title ""Church Burntings"") and discussed his experiences navigating the underground rock scene as an openly gay man. On paper, the loss is a bummer, but the disappointment fades once <i>Iron Balls</i> starts spinning; remaining guitarist Tannon Penland handles the increased load via skillful multitracking, and the band's fearsomely precise rhythm section-- bassist Cary Rowells and drummer Steve Shelton, both also of the recently reactivated Raleigh progressive-doom outfit Confessor, whose polarizing 1991 masterpiece, <i>Condemned</i>, planted the seed for Loincloth's insular obsessiveness-- sounds huger than ever, abetted by a crisp, full-bodied production job.</p>
<p>Crucially, the 16-track, 38-minute <i>Iron Balls</i> isn't just an entree portion of the appetizer delivered on the demo. Penland, Rowells, and Shelton seem to understand that their unwaveringly maximal math metal can be numbing, and they've found novel ways of adapting their aesthetic to the LP format without opting for obvious compromises like guest vocalists, covers, or the dreaded remix. (A few tracks do make tasteful use of ambient-style atmospherics, either as a backdrop or as interstitial material.) While some pieces here follow the zero-frills M.O. of the demo-- brutal brain-scramblers that exhaust themselves in little over a minute-- others strive for and achieve an actual emotional arc, an epic narrative sweep that places <i>Iron Balls</i> in the company of recent work by wordless prog-metal titans <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1179-dysrhythmia/"" target=""_blank"">Dysrhythmia</a>.</p>
<p>The best of the bite-size pieces are breathless marvels. ""Hoof-Hearted"", the album's shortest track at 75 seconds, juxtaposes a needling solo-guitar break with vertiginous drops into a hard-swinging, full-band groove. After the initial kick-in, the band works its way up to a series of white-water accents and quickly yanks the rug out, again leaving Penland alone. The trio recaps this sequence in various fractured forms, as though feeding their theme through a series of irregular gears; even after repeated listens, the track retains its dislocating power, but the basic motifs lodge firmly in your head. In contrast to the material on the demo, tracks like ""Hoof-Hearted"" and <i>Iron Balls</i> opener ""Underwear Bomb""-- in which a swaggery, prog-blues riff lumbers forward in the face of almost comically relentless mathy digressions-- leave you feeling strangely fulfilled, not merely pummeled.</p>
<p>On some tracks, technicality overwhelms coherence. The dizzyingly nimble ""Shark Dancer"", for example, shows off Steve Shelton's trademark stuttering double-bass work (never simply a cruise-control drone) and counterintuitive use of cymbals (marked by rigorous hand-muting and oddly placed thwacks), as well as Cary Rowells' intrepid mirroring of his rhythm partner. But the piece zooms ahead without a clear thematic thread and fails to make a lasting impression. ""Slow 6 Apocalypse"", which exhausts itself in a fit of Morse-code turbulence, feels similarly elusive.</p>
<p>In contrast, several more fleshed-out pieces here transcend the stone-faced chug of the demo-- not to mention the pervasive silliness of <i>Iron Balls</i>' album and track titles-- and achieve an improbable pathos. ""Stealing Pictures"" begins as headlong midtempo math rock, fueled by cyclical riffs that churn and mutate without pause, but around the minute mark, the tempo halves and Penland picks out a poignant theme redolent of warm-blooded 1990s post-hardcore (Quicksand comes to mind). Later in the song, the band returns to this passage and lingers on it in uncharacteristically patient fashion. ""Long Shadows"" fixates on its own captivating motif, woozy yet crystalline, which the band uses as a launchpad for a weighty avant-doom adventure. On these pieces, as well as other highlights like the glimmeringly textural closer, ""Clostfroth"", Loincloth peel back their armor-plated exterior to expose the beating heart within.</p>
<p>By recording a full-length, offering listeners a clear 360-degree view of their previously shadowy creation, Loincloth have put their valuable, longstanding mystique on the line. <i>Iron Balls</i> could've easily revealed that the project worked best as a one-off lark, thriving on the strict limitations of the EP format. But it turns out that this monster looks many times more intriguing up close; without taking any easy shortcuts, Penland, Rowells, and Shelton reveal here that their beast harbors genuine beauty. The disc ought to have the proud, few Loincloth faithful weeping with joy, but more importantly, it leaves room for a broader audience to hear what the fuss was all about.</p></div>"|16188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16188-iron-balls-of-steel/|7.9|Hank Shteamer

At this point, you could be forgiven for feeling sleepy whenever you hear hazy synthesizers mixed with a wayward drum pattern. But even though it arrived hopelessly late to the chillwave party, ""Nothing More"" was just too sticky to discount. It helped that Feld's voice, which wouldn't sound out of place on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Parade</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a> anthem, was strong and commanding. But on Expensive Looks' debut LP, <i>Dark Matters</i>, the single is something of an outlier. It turns out that Feld's interest in that kind of immediacy is limited, which accounts for both <i>Dark Matters</i>' appeal and limitations.</p>
<p>Feld's music has a ravey, enervated grandeur, but the glare of style sometimes seems like a way to mask the lack of substance. <i>Dark Matters</i> feels like the solution to an equation whose variables include <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"" target=""_blank"">Toro Y Moi</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28027-neon-indian/"" target=""_blank"">Neon Indian</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27668-nite-jewel/"" target=""_blank"">Nite Jewel</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/576-bibio/"" target=""_blank"">Bibio</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28739-baths/"" target=""_blank"">Baths</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28875-elite-gymnastics/"" target=""_blank"">Elite Gymnastics</a>--<span> </span>a timely concoction of lo-fi disco, corroded analog textures, submerged bass, chipmunk soul, and granulated funk. No one's saying that Feld is ripping anyone off-- this stuff is all just in the air. But that doesn't change the fact that this sound is currently feeling threadbare. That's why my favorite track on <i>Dark Matters</i> is also the weirdest: opener ""Your Dreams Our Week"", which is divisible by only itself. Each stem of the track feels like an independent process, and you get the sense they could slide apart at any moment. The result is a track with genuine tension, willfulness, and originality. In this strange way, Feld's music may be best at its worst. Errors enliven it.</p>
<p>This kind of audacity doesn't surface again until the last track, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14863-vanishers/"" target=""_blank"">""Vanishers""</a>-- which, unfortunately, is a senseless mess; the only seriously bad stretch on an otherwise charming record. The songs between ""Nothing More"" and ""Vanishers"" are pleasant to zone out to, with potent moments of dark euphoria, but hard to remember. With the possible exception of <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/group-tightener/expensive-looks-moving"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Moving Visions""</a>, the pop songs fall short of the heights of ""Nothing More"", while the little interstitials feel random. It's good fun but never pushes against anything, which is no fatal flaw, but no revelation either.</p></div>"|16185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16185-dark-matters/|6.3|Brian Howe

The pair assembled a dense but brittle map of drones, foreboding sound effects, and delicate melodies, submerging acoustic sounds in pools of digital filters. The result was something suited to filmmaker David Fincher's work-- brooding, mysterious, and tinged with anxiety. The film world agreed: Reznor's first foray into soundtrack work after putting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"" target=""_blank"">Nine Inch Nails</a> on hiatus landed him both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Who knew? Fincher clearly has confidence in their abilities, as he tapped Reznor and Ross once again to score his latest movie, the film adaption of <i>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. </i>With the team earning another Golden Globe nomination, it would seem like they're doing something right.</p>
<p><i>Dragon Tattoo</i> doesn't differ drastically from <i>Social Network</i> but it's not a retread. For starters, this one's a three-hour beast, spread out over three CDs, six vinyl LPs, or a whopping 39 digital files. So while <i>The Social Network</i> could be received as a digestible standalone product, <i>Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</i> doesn't offer the same sort of flexibility. That's in part by design as much as structure: Where <i>The </i><i>Social Network</i> had discernible motifs like ""Hand Covers Bruise"" and pseudo-techno like ""In Motion"", the music here is more obtuse, focused on building tension and defining space rather than conveying feeling or emotion through melody. Which means there are few standout tracks; instead, the most arresting moments emerge out of layers of increasingly damaged sounds that set an uncompromisingly bleak mood.</p>
<p>The score's overcast outlook is well suited to Fincher's portrayal of Sweden as an outwardly and proudly modern country overrun with the dehumanizing potential of technology. It's a place haunted equally by industrial remnants of past eras and shameful personal and political histories. The task of Reznor and Ross is to create something conflicted between technology and tradition, and they opt for a sound that's essentially future-baroque: fiercely plucked strings, ominous bass, decaying chimes, and spare pianos held together with meticulous post-processing.</p>
<p>But where <i>Dragon Tattoo</i> excels in its role as soundtrack, it falters in listenability: imagine something like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11289-ghosts-i-iv/"" target=""_blank"">Ghosts I-IV</a> </i>but almost double the length and without all the catchy parts. True, it <i>is</i> easy to admire the sheer complexity of their work in small doses. Pieces like ""Hypomania"" drift into clouds of hellish distortion and re-emerge, while ""Oraculum"" features vividly tactile drums that feel heavily removed from your typical Hollywood percussive suspense music. So while this might be a soundtrack, it rises above mere Hollywood muzak.</p>
<p>As the set drifts into its third and final disc, the pace begins to pick up and form shapes that might be recognizable to Reznor adherents. ""Great Bird of Prey"" could be an instrumental leftover from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5799-the-fragile/"" target=""_blank"">The Fragile</a></i> days, while ""Infiltrator"" weaves in and out of sections of intensely energetic movement. ""An Itch"" traps what sounds like human screams and moans beneath an actual beat, while the warbly ""Closer"" piano even makes a reappearance in ""The Heretics"", a sly wink and nod to its composers' considerable musical history.</p>
<p>For those fans who <i>wouldn't</i> want to spend $300 on a 6xLP box set of soundtrack music, <i>Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</i> is likely to remain a curiosity apart from its two bookending vocal tracks. The movie's sleek opening sequence is soundtracked by the Reznor and Karen O's cover of Led Zeppelin's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/special-presentation/1881-trent-reznor-karen-o/"" target=""_blank"">""Immigrant Song""</a>, a mean reminder of the power Reznor's pop music holds at its most ferocious. On the other end of the spectrum, the three hours wind down with a cover of Bryan Ferry's ""Is Your Love Strong Enough?"" by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28841-how-to-destroy-angels/"" target=""_blank"">How to Destroy Angels</a> (the band composed of Ross, Reznor, and wife Mariqueen Maandig). To hear a human voice so bright and clear after what's come before is a moment of pure pop relief. But pop is not what <i>Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</i> is about. It's reasonable to question the necessity of a score whose sprawling mass exceeds the length of the film it's meant for. But even if it doesn't quite work as a standalone experience, the real takeaway here is that Reznor and Ross may be ushering in an exciting new realm of possibility for mainstream film scoring.</p></div>"|16180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16180-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/|7.0|Andrew Ryce

On <i>Urban Legend</i> he swatted at upstarts who would challenge him. And with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8319-king/"" target=""_blank"">King</a></i>, he crashed through to the national stage. By the time of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12279-paper-trail/"" target=""_blank"">Paper Trail</a></i>, the rapper had crossed over completely, with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQJACVmankY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Whatever You Like""</a> becoming the his first No. 1 hit.</p>
<p>Beneath this narrative of triumph, of course, was a tumultuous undercurrent: A friend was killed in front of him, drugs abused, and unthinkable paranoia led to felony weapons charges, jail time, parole violations, and more jail time. While an artist like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"" target=""_blank"">Gucci</a> seemed so reckless with the opportunities he had earned, T.I. always gave the impression that he was striving to escape that trap. Fresh from his most recent dalliance with hard time, the rapper is back in the scrappy mode of his early days; as it's ever been, the worst thing you can do is count him out. But while <i>Fuck Da City Up</i> finds the rapper  in a hungry mode, it also has a vague sense of listlessness. It's difficult to get a feel for the rapper's story. He seems to have left the personal narratives and ethical tensions that charged his earlier works behind. In its place, he has shifted his focus in twin directions: proving he's still got the energy of a rapper half his age (he does). And proving that he can still make bangers. This is where the tape doesn't reach the bar set by earlier efforts.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that <i>Fuck Da City Up</i> dropped around the same time as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16140-thug-motivation-103-hustlerz-ambition/"" target=""_blank"">Jeezy's comeback record</a>, and shortly before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Ross</a>' oxygen-stealing <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16172-rich-forever/"" target=""_blank"">Rich Forever</a></i>. Because T.I. just can't do blockbuster rap bangers like those two. His style was more dexterous nuance than bludgeoning <i>Scarface</i> mantras. Here, his best moments seem to rely on the talents of his guests to create some (admittedly impressive) chemistry. Witness the superteam of Travis Porter, Young Dro, Tip, and ""I'm on One""-producer T-Minus for the showstopping ""Hot Wheels"". ""On Purpose"" is another highlight, and the collaborative team of Trouble and T.I. (""It's '<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqxkr4xOCg4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trouble Man</a>' riding with Trouble, man, them mu'fuckers in trouble, man"") have a very real musical symmetry; it's easy to imagine that <i>Trap Muzik</i>'s sense of moral strength may have had a heavy influence on Trouble's 2011 mixtape <i>December 17th</i>.</p>
<p>Sonically, you'd be hard pressed to argue that anyone but T.I. picked out these beats; bouncier and heavier on regal horn parts than the typical rap record today, they retain the <i>King</i> vibe even though the producer names have changed. Perhaps the best production comes from Hit Boy, who laces the amusingly named ""Harry Potter"" with a shimmering wall-of-sparks beat that deserves a better title. T.I.'s rapping throughout the tape retains the balance of smooth style, a perfect Southern rapper's accent, and the ability to telegraph energy through a dazzlingly rhythmic flow. But ultimately, the songs simply aren't there, certainly not ones that will rival Ross', and T.I.'s narrative here feels too weakly articulated to make up for songwriting shortcomings.</p>
<p>While relying on biography to invigorate his raps a decade distant from the street life might be unrealistic, when his music was at its most fascinating, his willingness to wrestle with the moral dimension of his experiences helped streamline his music, giving it verisimilitude that felt in short supply in the cutthroat world of street rap. It gave some of the more plain moments an impassioned purpose, which allowed the listener to ignore hip-hop's cult of Bangers. It also helped sand down the rough edges on a musical level; while Jeezy's monolithic sound could sweep up listeners in its pure, epic, and totalitarian vision, T.I. was always too flawed, too self-aware to go for those sorts of transparent theatrics. This made for compelling rap music when his story was central. But when the only story is the one arguing for your own relevance, you end up with a lot of sound and fury.</p></div>"|16174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16174-ti-fuck-da-city-up/|7.1|David Drake

Almost a decade later, it <i>still</i> feels impossible, but for entirely different reasons: Whether we're talking about freestyles caught on cell phones in clubs or fully thought-out mixtapes, the brand-newest shit from grime's young turks and old hands is now instantly accessible. Much like the current state of U.S. rap, grime unleashes an avalanche of semi-underground material every month, and you can catch a headache just <i>thinking</i> about trying to process everything.</p>
<p>No one represents the promise and perils of this state of affairs better than <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/eskiboywiley"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wiley</a>, still one of the genre's most distinct voices and crucial producers. Up until 2006, you could listen to the entire recorded output of this grime godfather, from bedroom beat experiments to charting singles that reshaped UK urban music, in just a couple of hours. Now it's arguable that even <i>Wiley</i> can't remember every track he's released in the past half-decade. In 2007, he put out no less than six ""best-of"" mixtapes, and he hasn't slowed down since. If anything, since his brief brush with the UK mainstream in 2008 thanks to the pop-dance undeniablility of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOAZsad_ea8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wearing My Rolex""</a>, he's sped up, as if his thwarted dalliance with a major label allowed him to see the futility of releasing one ""official"" album every few years in a cloud-based world. But <i>Evolve</i>, available through the auspices of real-deal label Big Dada, is clearly being marketed as one of the Wiley releases you should pay closer attention to.</p>
<p>And you should. Gone are the sickly sweet R&amp;B choruses from his last LP, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15711-chill-out-zone/"" target=""_blank"">Chill Out Zone</a></i>, a sometimes gorgeous but mostly misguided foray into grime-goes-quiet-storm. From opener ""Welcome to Zion"", we're clearly in old-school Wiley World, as defined by the chilly synth tones and hand-drum-and-computer-clonk rhythms of his earliest singles like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQy1Pzf7YtA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Igloo""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upHyZ5vgdgY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Eskimo""</a>, albeit with a fresh-for-2012 production upgrade. It's no surprise to learn he's hooked up on a few tracks with Mark Pritchard from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29608-africa-hitech/"" target=""_blank"">Africa Hitech</a>, whose best music similarly brings together twisted quotes from the history of rave and manic polyrhythms that feel conscious of Afro-Cuban tradition and post-human at the same time. In the early days, no other producer had Wiley's strange feel for lurch-and-stagger funk, for a shouldn't-work-but-does kind of syncopation, and it's nice to know he hasn't abandoned his bizarre way with beats in favor of comfortably waist-winding grooves.</p>
<p>Wiley hasn't totally given up on crossover success, and <i>Evolve</i> is no way an hour-long return to pirate-radio mic-busting brutalism. But even the cuts aimed at dancers rather than freestyle trainspotters have a pleasingly off-kilter feel that owes more to the wilder side of dancehall and its endless global mutations. ""Boom Blast"" is an obvious stab at the party-rocking electro that's everywhere in mainstream pop these days, but with wilder drums and a more menacing vibe. Its resemblance to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4s6H4ku6ZY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Like a G6""</a> merely points out how stark that chart-topper was, rather than how pop Wiley can go. He sounds revitalized as a rapper, too. Gone are the mushy-soft love rhymes from <i>Chill Out</i>, blessedly replaced on many of <i>Evolve</i>'s deep cuts with the reams of breathless and bracing East London slang and hard-won introspection that once marked him a potential UK <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas/"" target=""_blank"">Nas</a> rather than a fleet cockney Ja Rule. When he does indulge in mere playa braggadocio, there's often a wicked and knowing silliness to help the boasts go down, and the wildstyle bass manipulations on tunes like ""Link Up"" and ""I'm Skanking"" once again shout, ""I'm a badman,"" as loudly as the rhymes. Plus his sense of humor remains as twisted and idiosyncratic as ever. Perhaps only Wiley would concoct a minimalist, almost gothic instrumental and then turn it into a skit about how hard it can be to catch a cab.</p>
<p>It would be a shame if you do overlook <i>Evolve</i> out of fatigue, since its one of his best, a mostly single-minded return to the on-the-mic fierceness and computers-go-tribal rhythms that first made his name. But it would be totally understandable. In 2010, he threw 11 .zip files of new beats onto an unsuspecting internet. I can barely remember a single thing about that particular data dump, except a feeling of amazement slowly giving way to exhaustion. In 2011, he put out not only three mixtapes, but two of those as official albums, at least one of which was another semi-classic almost lost in his manic flow. And not one to let more than six months go by without a new transmission from the Eskibeat bunker, he's already back with his eighth available-in-stores full-length in a little less than eight years. This one's a keeper, though, and if you've tuned out on grime over the last few years, either from negligence or overload, here's an easy way to reenter grime's current moment, even if Wiley will likely declare it old news in a couple weeks.</p></div>"|16182.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16182-evolve-or-be-extinct/|7.2|Jess Harvell

It wasn't a huge hit, but it did exert a big influence as one of the first albums of the 1990s to explore lush chamber pop in any depth. (Chamber pop is pretty much a nucleotide in the DNA of indie rock today, which makes it easy to forget that it wasn't always that way.) The original 1994 Cardinal album was met with a flurry of acclaim, but its spending many years out of print-- it was finally reissued in 2005-- meant not many people heard it after that initial burst.</p>

His partner, Richard Davies, who had already played in the Moles, has kept going with a low-profile solo career. There seems to be no particular occasion that prompted their reunion, but their re-emergence after such a long break, sounding basically like they used to, does afford us a chance to see how things have changed in almost 20 years. Their sound, a fairly basic brand of mostly mid-tempo, low-key indie rock adorned with brass fanfares and other decorative orchestration, doesn't stand out as much as it did back in the days of grunge, but it is still distinctive.</p>
<p>Thing is, for as much attention as they got back in the day, Cardinal never made the most instantly memorable music, and that holds true here as well. Davies likes to run his vocals through subtle processing, and he especially likes doubling himself singing clean on one track and processed on another. Often the only effect of this is that it blunts the melody. Matthews answers those melodies with big bursts of trumpet, but those answering statements can sound more mannered than felt-- across the album, there's hardly any syncopation, and with pretty much everything happening between the bar lines, the album sounds tight and staid even as it shoots for grandeur.</p>
<p>This is not to say <i>Hymns</i> doesn't have its moments. The first time Matthews hits us full-force with the brass, on ""Carbolic Smoke Ball"", it imparts a Bacharachian sweep to a song that otherwise walks in place. The reverberant piano of ""General Hospital"" nicely conjures the image of a cold, empty hospital hallway; the upbeat ""Love Like Rain"" is a welcome diversion into something approaching power pop; and Davies' closing refrain on ""Rosemary Livingstone""-- ""I want you to change/ But stay the same""-- is a funny way of stepping outside the band for a second and getting into the head of a listener who maybe doesn't know what he wants from this reunion. Fair enough. The reunion wasn't expected, and while it's nice to finally hear these two follow up on a promising debut, <i>Hymns</i> isn't likely to capture many people who weren't taken with the original Cardinal record.</p></div>"|16181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16181-hymns/|6.4|Joe Tangari

It's informative, though not completely necessary on a mixtape that derives its title by rhyming the slang for cough syrup and soda with the name of a strand of weed. Juicy-- one half of legendary, and legendarily bizarre, Memphis rap group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4388-three-6-mafia/"" target=""_blank"">Three 6 Mafia</a>-- seemingly spent most of 2011 ingesting enough recreational drugs to make Nikki Sixx raise an eyebrow, and paying producer Lex Luger for beats so he can rap about it. <i>Blue Dream &amp; Lean </i>is basically a continuation of Juicy's two collaborative mixtapes with Luger, <i>Rubber Band Business </i>and <i>Rubber Band Business 2</i>. Despite Luger's producing only nine of the album's 28 tracks, beats by Sonny Digital and Juicy himself work off of Luger's blueprint, which itself is partially filtered down from the type of dark, head-knocking production of classic Three 6.</p>
<p>The success and failure of the mixtape are two sides of the same coin. On the one hand, there's cohesion to <i>Blue Dream &amp; Lean </i>that serves it well. The result of Juicy's chanting about taking drugs over tracks that are largely similar is that he pulls you into his world, one where narcotics blur everything together until one day you have a 28-track mixtape, yet you still need to title every song, but you're so stoned that you just pick the dominant line from every chorus. Lesser artists have tried much harder to achieve the same effect and failed, and Juicy pulls it off effortlessly. The flip side of that, of course, is that a 28-track mixtape featuring Juicy J chanting over largely similar beats is far too many tracks, especially on the heels of two related tapes. <i>Blue Dream &amp; Lean </i>could be chopped in half and be no worse for the wear, but that's par for the course.</p>
<p>It's a shame, too, because a combination of the best Luger-style tracks and the few songs that go in a different direction would make for a very good album. The opening quarter of the mixtape is especially inspired, as it finds Juicy at the point where he's most concentrated on casually, almost mindlessly, talking shit. Interspersed throughout the album are songs like ""Big Bank""(produced by Drumma Boy, one of the most diverse producers in the South) and ""Stoners Night 2"", which break up the slight monotony but deserve to be highlighted even further. The latter, done by notable up-and-coming producer Harry Fraud, features a lush, soulful sample that's a breath of fresh air amongst the album's suffocating palette.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The latter part of the tape gives shine to blog favorites like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29688-spaceghostpurrp/"" target=""_blank"">Spaceghostpurrp</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28641-alley-boy/"" target=""_blank"">Alley Boy</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29697-kreayshawn/"" target=""_blank"">Kreayshawn</a>, all of whom sound much too eager to please. And though that's perfectly understandable, it's quite jarring considering that Juicy is trading in his ability to make the listener believe that he's self-destructively destroying his body regardless of the consequences. Kreayshawn at least managed to score the best chorus, and she and Juicy repeatedly asking each other, ""you trippy, mane?"" is the only time any of the aforementioned guests come off as carefree enough to hit on the album's vibe.</p>
<p><i>Blue Dream &amp; Lean</i> is allegedly Juicy's first offering as a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"" target=""_blank"">Wiz Khalifa</a>'s Taylor Gang, and though hot new rappers using their newfound power to sign legendary veterans that have faded from the spotlight almost always leads to a failure to meet inflated expectations, there's enough here to suggest that Juicy could put out a really good album with the input of a dedicated editor.</p></div>"|16177.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16177-blue-dream-lean/|5.7|Jordan Sargent

Though they didn't sound like Britpop, the term was applied anyway because the Big Pink seemed in the swaggering lineage of bands like Oasis, the Verve, and Mansun. But bands who emerge so fully formed sometimes lack staying power and, considering Big Pink co-founder Milo Cordell's roots running Merok Records during the cultural peak of blog-house and nu-rave, the band had to be aware of their potential limitations. The follow-up, <i>Future This</i>, finds the Big Pink as boxed in as their predecessors, recycling the same ideas with less conviction.</p>
<p>The drop-off is clear in the album's first few seconds: <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/43985-video-the-big-pink-stay-gold/"" target=""_blank"">""Stay Gold""</a> bears blatant similarity to their previous hit <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11423-dominos/"" target=""_blank"">""Dominos""</a> but shifts the lyrical focus from consequence-free sex to homilies about staying true to your dreams. It's a troubling thread that runs throughout <i>Future This</i>: where the Big Pink once mastered the role of magnetic, womanizing loners, here their tilt towards positivity and pursuit of a connection with their audience comes off as uncomfortably needy. This results in ill-defined salvos like ""Jump Music"" that awkwardly try to position themselves as message songs despite having no discernable message.</p>
<p>The Big Pink try to build a mythology by dropping references from their debut into new songs, as if the two lyrically divergent records were of a conceptual piece. They also toss in a reference to the Stone Roses' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D2qcbu26gs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Wanna Be Adored""</a>, establishing kinship with another band that was ultimately sunk by not knowing how to follow up a huge debut. And later, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/44657-video-the-big-pink-hit-the-ground-superman/"" target=""_blank"">""Hit the Ground (Superman)""</a> is every bit as gimmicky as ""Stay Gold"", incorporating a sample of Laurie Anderson's ""O Superman"" into its halting, Max Martin-like strut and illustrating the fatal flaw of <i>Future This</i>: their need to siphon the power of outside sources-- obvious samples, prefab slogans, even their borrowings from their own music. Where the Big Pink previously sounded invincible, nearly every attempt to intellectualize or streamline their sound makes <i>Future This </i>come off as timid and malnourished.</p>
<p>All of which makes the tender ""77"" a surprising closer. Touching on addiction and loss, lead singer Robbie Furze sings, ""You left such an impression on me/ Left on the debris/ Now I'm all fucked up/ And sometimes I forget I miss you."" It isn't exactly poetry, but it does feel unmistakably personal for a band whose most vulnerable song to this point told a lover to leave them alone. It's an awkward start to humanizing the Big Pink, but a start nonetheless.</p></div>"|16122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16122-future-this/|5.2|Ian Cohen

While <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>' grandiose <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16172-rich-forever/"" target=""_blank"">Rich Forever</a></i> mixtape, on sheer size alone, has threatened to blot out a lot of its Q1 competition, solid efforts abound for hip-hop fans-- this has been the single best month in what seems like years. It's here, in this overcrowded field, that Wu-Tang dynamo <a href=""http://raekwonchronicles.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Raekwon</a> has unleashed <i>Unexpected Victory</i>, essentially his first full-length release since 2011's fine <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15210-shaolin-vs-wu-tang/"" target=""_blank"">Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang</a></i> LP. In any other month, <i>Victory</i> might eke out a few more ways to live up to its title. But for Rae, spitting criminology raps over grimy orchestral stabs and murky slivers of soul isn't exactly unexpected, and-- armed with a crop of passable productions and an uneven roster of guest stars-- rarely smacks of anything like victory.</p>
<p><i>Victory</i> splits its time between fellow New York vets (<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/4755-mobb-deep/"" target=""_blank"">Mobb Deep</a>, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/514-busta-rhymes/"" target=""_blank"">Busta Rhymes</a>, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/29165-cl-smooth/"" target=""_blank"">C.L. Smooth</a>) and relative newbies (Fred Da Godson, Chicago's L.E.P. Bogus Boys), and holds to a fairly tight-knit stable of guest rappers and producers (Sauce Money, Scram Jones) eager to cook up a slinkier take on post-<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"" target=""_blank"">RZA</a> muck at the Chef's behest. Flossy, almost Rossian widescreeners ""Just a Toast"" and ""Luxury Rap"", the sinewy, stretched-out soul of ""Silk"" and the <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/7025-just-blaze/"" target=""_blank"">Just Blaze</a>-nodding ""MTV Cribs"" bring a little light to the proceedings, but the sound here mostly hangs out in the dank realm Rae's been favoring forever. <i>Victory</i>'s greatest flaw is its wildly varying fidelity; listening, you'll have to get up every few minutes to work the volume knob, and even then, you may not be able to make out everything that's going on in, say, the hissy ""The Brewery"". Still, on a tape that could use a few more outliers, skits, practical jokes, something, this little bit of audience participation works wonders for engagement; you'd probably never hear Ceazar-n-Reason's lackluster ""Brewery"" verses if you didn't have to crank the song so loud to hear Raekwon at all. Couple that with the incongruous appearance of young Altrina Renee's post-Aaliyah/""E-Mail My Heart"" lunger ""Facetime"", and you've got less mixtape, more data-dump: an anything-goes, congruity-be-damned assortment of whatever was lying around at the time.</p>
<p>Ever since threatening defection from the Wu following 2007's intoxicatingly odd <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10975-8-diagrams/"" target=""_blank"">8 Diagrams</a></i>, Raekwon's revealed himself to be a key figure in the Wu-Tang's conservative wing. His much-lauded <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13441-only-built-4-cuban-linx-pt-ii/"" target=""_blank"">2009 LP</a> was, after all, the sequel to one of the more singular LPs in rap history, and while <i>Cuban Linx II</i> wasn't exactly a Xerox, you could certainly see where he'd laid down the tracing paper. Last year's <i>Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang</i> was similar, richly detailed, in-the-pocket mafioso talk over stark, gritty strings. It's a lane Rae absolutely owns, one he's ridden pretty much since the start, and while he should be congratulated for never bending to any whims but his own, his set-jaw consistency doesn't always make for the most dazzling music.</p>
<p>He gets some good lines in all over <i>Victory</i>, of course; any Raekwon song with ""Story"" in the title is bound to be a good one, and both ""Soldier Story"" and the 9th Wonder-produced ""A Pinebox Story"" find his masterful narrative skills and unflinching brutality as sharp as ever, still stringing together bits of seemingly disconnected detail until a picture begins to take shape. But, when he drops a <i>Twilight</i> reference in his very first verse here, he seems a little lost without a plot. It can't all be smoke-filled backrooms or alleyway beatdowns, but elsewhere, Rae seems a little scattered, either resorting to stock phrases (""Riding at breakneck speed/ Gimme weed/ Gimme cheese/ I like cheddar"") or finding a reference-- any reference-- that sorta works. (Raekwon, if you're wondering, is on Team Jacob.) The occasional line pops out, but it's rare that he grabs you for a whole verse that doesn't have a clear beginning, middle, and end. <i>Victory</i>'s guest roster hits more than it misses; the elder statesmen types bring about what you'd expect to the table, though <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/30073-prodigy/"" target=""_blank"">Prodigy</a> had me rolling with ""you tacky like headrest TVs."" It's rising star Fred Da Godson who fares best here, though, noting on ""Luxury Rap"" that he's ""a phenomenon [like] Travolta with the tumor"" who ""should rhyme with some Wallabees on."" But, apart from the irrepressible Busta and a few of the more excitable youths, these guys tend to trade in the kind of cold-eyed, unexcitable confidence Rae does, which-- coupled with Rae's own coolness of demeanor and the general steeliness of these beats-- leaves one with the weird feeling that there's both a lot of Raekwon on this record and not very much Raekwon at all.</p>
<p>I was maybe three or four spins into <i>Unexpected Victory</i> before I realized something: I had no idea what exactly Rae meant to promote with its release, what gap he meant to stop by unleashing these songs into the world. I'm told Rae, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/search/?query=ghostface"" target=""_blank"">Ghost</a>, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/679-cappadonna/"" target=""_blank"">Cappadonna</a>, and the LOX are at work on a collaborative LP called <i>Wu-Block</i>, and of course, there's talk of a new Wu-Tang LP by year's end. To prepare for the new Wu LP, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/1812-gza/"" target=""_blank"">GZA</a> reportedly went to MIT to spend a few days studying mitochondria or something; you'll be pleased to hear there's been no talk of Raekwon shipping off to Le Cordon Bleu for a week of chef's training. Ultimately, you want Raekwon rapping; preferably, you want Raekwon rapping about the grisliest possible subjects, over crackling, cinematic RZA beats. <i>Unexpected Victory</i>'s sound is too lousy-- and its stakes too low-- to ever possibly live up to his past glories. What's most frustrating, though, is how little Rae's adjusted to this brave new world of the mixtape-as-album; here's one of the premier album artists in hip-hop history, tossing out what amount to well-intentioned scraps without even bothering to check if the thing's mastered before it went live. Can you blame anybody for burning their first click on <i>Rich Forever</i>?</p></div>"|16170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16170-unexpected-victory/|6.0|Paul Thompson

A combination of serendipity and opportunism, a moment is a flash of triumph, unplanned and difficult to reproduce. To offer some perspective, cargo pants are also having a moment. Like Terje productions (as opposed to remixes), cargo pants disappeared for a few years mid-decade; now they're back, and they look (sound) better than anyone remembers. Hell, it was only six months ago when, upon asking a friend if he had any interest in a Terje DJ tour stop in Chicago, I received the following curt reply: ""No. I don't want to listen to a bunch of space disco shit."" But Terje's three-song <i>Ragysh</i> EP-- the one that included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/8726-the-top-100-tracks-of-2011/5/"" target=""_blank"">year</a>-<a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1422"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">end</a> <a href=""http://www.littlewhiteearbuds.com/chart/lwes-top-30-tracks-of-2011-10-6/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">chart</a> barnstormer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12216-snooze-4-love/"" target=""_blank"">""Snooze 4 Love""</a>-- dropped and proved surprisingly sticky.</p>
<p>This month he follows that with<i> It's the Arps</i>, a four-track EP on ""space disco shit"" mothership Smalltown Supersound, composed with an ARP2600 analog synthesizer. The first line of <a href=""http://www.vintagesynth.com/arp/arp.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vintage Synth Explorer's ARP2600 entry</a> is, ""The ARP 2600 is without a doubt one of the finest analog synthesizers ever."" Terje has always been a sound-- and not a retro-- fetishist. Why else devote his precious remix work to nu-disco bench players and classic rock mammoths in equal measure? It's no surprise then that he'd be tempted by a mystical artifact such as the Arp, which, like many old synthesizers, looks like the kind of rune-encrusted rock-toy that his music's implied spaceships set out in search of. (The former astrophysics student is a rumored future space traveler.)</p>
<p>Terje's own productions-- like those of labelmate <span style=""color: #222222;"">Lindstrøm</span>-- favor knob-twiddling disco, like Giorgio Moroder without the pop-vocal instincts. He's confident and gifted enough to throw away an all-time piano loop on a <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/bryanferry/alphaville-todd-terje-remix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bryan Ferry remix</a>. On <i>It's the Arps</i>, he trades the sturdy eight-minute structures of <i>Ragysh</i> for a baggier and more colorful sound. ""Inspector Norse"" would be a pro-forma space-disco jam in lesser hands-- it has that bulbous bassline, the tint of humor-- but Terje transforms it into a daytime noir, one that spreads its pinging notes wide. The star of the show is the two-track ""Swing Star"" suite, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12930-swing-star-pt-1/"" target=""_blank"">part one</a> a wicked treadmill of double-time sequences over blocky bass and hiss-y drums. It's synth music as roadside fireworks: Light the fuse and back away quickly. ""Swing Star Pt. 2"" explores the same chord progression but with a cleaner palate, and the result is a light-breeze boogie that feels like a comedown. (The fourth track ""Myggsommer"" is a narrow miss, a vine-y synth doodle that suggests vintage synth flippancy can be as precocious as vintage guitar-tone exercises.)</p>
<p>This might've been lost in the space disco explosion a half-decade ago, but with his contemporaries wandering off into prog, kraut, and sundry other forms of out-music, the clean lines and easy momentum of <i>It's the Arps</i> are really refreshing. And Jesus, it's fun. The trouble with moments, of course, is extending them. Terje has the imagination. An <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12974-love-is-the-drug-todd-terje-disco-dub/"" target=""_blank"">upcoming Roxy Music remix</a> suggests Terje will be a more consistent presence, which is fantastic: I'd really like not to be comparing him to fedoras in 2017.</p></div>"|16173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16173-its-the-arps/|7.6|Andrew Gaerig

His latest album picks up on the themes of <i>Been Meaning to Tell You</i>, and as the title <i>Natural Traits </i>might suggest, brings those ideals of nature to a more genune hybrid.</p>
<p><i>Natural Traits</i> finds itself at home in a whitewashed world of pastel and rounded shapes, avoiding the hectic, everything-at-once sprawl of modern ""bass music"" (particularly the American variety) in favor of careful, deliberate movements. To call it simple would be diminutive, but there's something distinctly digestible and affable about the slow-but-steady way Gonzales builds his tracks. It's typified in the album's stately opener, ""The Prudence of Evolution"", methodically layering soft drums on top of chords on top of two delicate 8-bit synth melodies that intertwine like DNA strands yet nimbly sidestep the juvenilia so often associated with the sugary sound.</p>
<p>Those 8-bit feelers are the dominant melodic device on <i>Natural Traits</i>, a thicket of flinty frequencies that never quite loosens its curious tension: The synth almost always sounds brittle and trebly, set against gorgeous, reverb-heavy guitar jangle and a set of drum sounds that range from hollow to realistic. When the two opposites combine, as on the beautiful beatless centerpiece ""Peaks &amp; Valleys"", the result is somewhere between summery indie rock and something more indebted to electronic music, a divide toed by the record with every track so that it occupies an in-between space in keeping with its equally middle-ground array of sounds and textures. It's an attractive medium rather than a middling one, however; Gonzales' resolution is one that engenders approachability rather than dilution.</p>
<p>As MOR as <i>Natural Traits</i> might sound, however, it willingly engages with dance music in a more direct way than <i>Been Meaning to Tell You</i>. Like his Mexicans With Guns project, however, they're rarely ""dance"" in a definitively genre-indebted, quantized sense. Take highlight ""The Sentimental Sea"", Gonzales' riff on 130-bpm house: The kick thumps balefully with little flourish, but a fluid, slippery loop brings it closer to something like sensual dub techno. That is, until Gonzales' warm streams of bass and uplifting guitar plucks flood the track's second half, turning it from arch savant-house into a landscape teeming with lush life. Elsewhere, the percussion gets lost in a tug of war: In ""When Synchronicity Fails"", Gonzales anticipates the rigid housey lope with a billowing guitar riff that trips over itself, synthesizing syncopation out of thin air, while ""The Heroic Lives of Particles"" plays with swung dubstep-leaning percussive patterns that lend a certain groove to the track's loose synth scribbles. They're moves that <i>should</i> be disorienting but instead sound easy in Gonzales' confident hands.</p>
<p><i>Natural Traits</i> succeeds largely on account of its relative modesty and transparency-- sometimes the most satisfying records are the ones where you can guess exactly how everything was built in the first place. Undoubtedly Gonzales' strongest statement yet, it comes one step closer to achieving that impossible fusion of the synthetic and natural, quietly experimental in spite of its own humility. Like most of his work, it doesn't fit into any narrative but his own (though it does slot in nicely with the recent stretch of woodsy material that has defined Friends of Friends' better output for the past year), and it doesn't need to: Post-rock for the <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> generation, <i>Natural Traits</i> is 40 minutes of elegant pastoralism and refined instrumental songwriting at its best.</p></div>"|16167.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16167-natural-traits/|7.4|Andrew Ryce

Despite all this activity, <i>Moonlight Farm</i> seemed such a distinctive, stand-alone piece of work that it never seemed necessary to expect or require a sequel.<span> </span>So the appearance of <i>Morning &amp; Sunrise</i> comes as a very pleasant surprise, particularly in that it finds Olausson returning to the evocative terrain of <i>Moonlight Farm</i> without simply repeating himself.</p>
<p>On the surface, <i>Morning &amp; Sunrise</i> would seem to be just as homemade as <i>Moonlight Farm</i>, but apparently the album has undergone several stages of mixing before being finished by Jarvis Taveniere of <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"" target=""_blank"">Woods</a>. The completed work is slightly less folky, more electric and more rock-inclined than its predecessor, and in several places it sounds not all that far removed from the lo-fi Woodsist/Captured Tracks axis. Yet using primarily the simple tools of double-tracked vocals and echo-coated guitars, Olausson still creates his own inimitable narcotic atmosphere, and even at its most propulsive his music retains a unique sense of time-distorting gravity.</p>
<p>And if nothing else <i>Morning &amp; Sunrise</i> certainly shows that Olausson still knows how to cultivate a little mystique. The album comes wrapped in a sleeve that is a perfect recreation of exactly the sort of private press obscurity that collectors love to find in the Goodwill bins, and Olausson is characteristically vague about the album's personnel. So when trace elements of percussion or gentle loping bass emerge from the soupy mix, there is no telling who is playing, and it is possible (if not probable) that everything is being overdubbed by Olausson himself. <span> </span>This sense of facelessness suits <i>Morning &amp; Sunrise</i> just fine, as in the final mix all the instruments blend into the same gauzy frame regardless, with Olausson's moody, Skip Spence-like baritone nodding off in front.</p>
<p>Given the album's powerful loner/outsider vibe, most listeners might be conditioned to expect Olausson's songs to show signs of being somehow disturbed or depressive. Oftentimes, however, on <i>Morning &amp; Sunrise</i> the opposite is true, and on such tracks as ""Don't Drown in Sorrows"" or ""When Your Bridges Burned"", his lyrics can read almost as quiet motivational speeches, as though he intends to give the most laconic pep talks in history. ""You don't know what you're asking, when you're asking him to stay,"" he advises some unseen friend, ""Trying to keep him close to you is just pushing him away."" This element of sage guidance has a disorienting effect when coupled with the music's sedative flow, particularly when followed by the likes of ""Neptune"" or the title track, where Olausson's vocals can periodically disintegrate completely into the darkening echoes, sounding as if the oracle has faded after it has provided as much counsel as it can.</p>
<p>Transfixing as his voice and words can be, on ""Riding on the Wind"" and ""Doctor's Deeds"" his guitar work is deceptively lucid and wholly captivating. And though there are fewer unexpected instrumental flourishes than on <i>Moonlight Farm</i>, there are discreet touches-- a ghostly whistle here, a shuffling country rhythm there-- on every track to reward those ready to sink deeper into the music's enveloping grip. As a whole the album makes an excellent companion piece to <i>Moonlight Farm</i>, even if it lacks some of that record's initial otherworldly, <i>where-did-this-come-from</i> impact, and raises anticipation for further dispatches from Olausson in the future.</p></div>"|16136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16136-jakob-olausson/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

Ross was a successful artist before he ever hooked up with Luger, but his stunning transition from begrudgingly accepted popular rapper to one of the genre's most respected artists can basically be traced directly back to Luger's beat for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2MVzP4MaJ0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""B.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast)""</a>, the song that will go down as the indelible single of Ross' career. The beat was so titanic that Ross-- who had gone to great pains to protect the self-constructed image of himself as an opulent drug kingpin-- shouted a chorus where he imagined himself as genuine, real-life drug kingpins Big Meech and Larry Hoover. In one fell swoop, Ross tore down his carefully assembled existence while simultaneously building up the one that paved the way for the career surge he's riding, which has culminated in <i>Rich Forever, </i>the new mixtape that now stands as his artistic pinnacle.</p>
<p>""B.M.F."" is genius for many reasons, but there is one crucial aspect of the song that makes <i>Rich Forever</i> tick: It was the first time that Ross ever <i>really</i> got mean. It's almost incredible to consider, but despite his stature and physical presence, ""B.M.F."" was the first intimidating Ross track since his debut single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU9TouRnO84"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hustlin'""</a>, the first since then that pumped a dangerous amount of adrenaline into your veins. In the four years between those songs, Ross kept everything but wealth and women at a distance. He chose cinematic, orchestral beats that colored that image perfectly, and while it was no doubt an effective strategy, songs like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHRWvaj35FM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Maybach Music 2""</a> are the equivalent of a living room in a mansion where you'd be afraid to touch any of the furniture. ""B.M.F."" was Rick Ross as Dave Chappelle as Rick James yelling <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcJkhSUSnek"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""fuck yo' couch,""</a> except the couch was actually his own. It was exactly what his career needed.</p>
<p>Luger produces only one song on <i>Rich Forever</i>, but his fingerprints are all over the mixtape, and its roots are firmly in ""B.M.F."". It's the first Rick Ross full-length with an attitude, and the result is a record where it finally feels like something's at stake for the Teflon Don. The aggrieved sneer of ""…these <i>motherfuckers</i> mad that I'm icy!"" permeates the album, and the energy derived from Ross' contempt adds an important dimension to his character, one that was missing when he got too comfortable making 1,000-thread-count music. The best beats here-- the ones that act as the backbone of the album-- are appropriately sinister, and actually improve on the Luger template that has dominated street rap for the past 18 months. There's the grinding churn of ""MMG Untouchable"", the haunted house bombast of ""King of Diamonds"", and the appropriately glistening keys of ""Yella Diamonds"", beats so good they render Luger's lone actual production (""Off the Boat"") totally unnecessary.</p>
<p>The opening quarter of <i>Rich Forever </i>especially drips with disdain, and though deviations into radio pop and the lush instrumentation he's long cultivated do pop up, Ross sets a tone for the record early that courses through every track that follows. ""B.M.F."" did happen to crest with his marked improvement as a writer, but it also magnified Ross' ability to pen spectacularly outlandish and vivid boasts, and he stuffs a vast number of them into the first four or five tracks here. Ross calling his chain ""the ghetto's guillotine"" on ""High Definition"" or his Corvette ""so clean you'll think Bruce Springsteen rent that"" on ""Fuck 'Em"" or conveying his hunger for money by hilariously seething that he ""likes his nachos hot"" on ""MMG Untouchable"" is the mark of the Don at work, not content to merely build verses around the names of luxury sunglasses brands. And when he does retreat back to the throne for a regal track like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12953-keys-to-the-crib-ft-styles-p/"" target=""_blank"">""Keys to the Crib""</a> later on the album, there's an undeniably spiteful glee in his voice that's missing from his earlier albums.</p>
<p>Ross has jarred himself out of his comfort zone and gotten his hands dirty, and in doing so he's also fleshed out an image of the boss as paranoid and constantly peeking over his shoulder. ""Last Breath"", which smartly tabs <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30022-meek-mill/"" target=""_blank"">Meek Mill</a> (Ross' top underling) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12128-birdman/"" target=""_blank"">Birdman</a> (the bossest of all rap bosses) for guest verses, undercuts images of ringside seats and all-white Beamers with a feeling of queasy desperation and lurking mistrust. Then there's ""Stay Schemin'"" which perfectly deploys a zonked-out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"" target=""_blank"">French Montana</a> to mumble-sing a hook about staying one step ahead of plotting enemies. Montana sounds so stoned that it brings to mind the image of Tony Montana lurching his head up from a pile of cocaine, and it's a fascinating, if not bizarre, end to an album that starts with Ross at his absolute meanest.</p>
<p>""God forgives, I don't,"" is a phrase that pops up from time to time on <i>Rich Forever</i>, and fittingly it's slated to serve as the title of Ross' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44252-rick-ross-shares-details-of-new-album-god-forgives-i-dont-two-new-tracks/"" target=""_blank"">upcoming album</a>. He'd been batting around the slogan long before this mixtape existed, but <i>Rich Forever </i>adds vindictive muscle to a motto that at one point might have come off as a hollow attempt at branding. It's a record that uses nastiness to cement the character ""Rick Ross"" as three-dimensional, and uses a barrage of bangers to cement the rapper Rick Ross as an undeniable force.</p></div>"|16172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16172-rich-forever/|8.2|Jordan Sargent

From 1992 until 2002, the mysterious electro outfit created not only some of Detroit's most original and enduring electronic music; they created an entire imaginary world, one of the greatest myth systems in the history of techno.</p>
<p>A new compilation of the group's work, the first in a planned four-volume anthology put out by Rotterdam's Clone label, serves as a crucial introduction to Drexciya's worldview as well as, of course, their music. It's a good time for it: In the past two decades, the meaning of ""electro"" has repeatedly mutated and diluted though its association with electroclash, then <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Ed+Banger"" target=""_blank"">Ed Banger</a>'s buzzy brand of dance music, and, lately, big-tent commercial rave like Deadmau5 and Wolfgang Gartner. The Drexciya reissue rightly returns the spotlight to the original electro's signature rhythms and analog palette.</p>
<p>From their first release, 1992's <i>Deep Sea Dweller</i> EP, Drexciya were obsessed with sub-aquatic realms. Their first tracks bore titles like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L5A1zu9ujg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sea Quake""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9QtwOgphs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nautilus 12""</a>, and the following year's <i>Bubble Metropolis</i> EP, divided into ""Fresh Water"" and ""Salt Water"" sides and with center stickers depicting dolphins cavorting beneath craggy cliffs, poured it on thicker with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMbK631xevU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Aqua Worm Hole""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGfBXJp4b44"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Danger Bay""</a>. The music was appropriately liquid, with hi-hats like raindrops, bass like the belch of some fanged denizen of the fathomless dark, and blippy melodies bobbing like bioluminescent lures.</p>
<p>Adapting the lurching rhythmic template of 1980s electro-funk acts like Man Parrish, Cybotron, and Jonzun Crew, Drexciya emphasized the depth-charge qualities of a booming 808 kick, and the electric-eel jolt of a zapping filter sweep. But it went deeper than that. The music was punctuated by cryptic interludes and scraps of code, like an intercepted transmission from ""Drexciyan Cruise Control Bubble 1 to Lardossan Cruiser 8 dash 203 X"", a head-spinning array of names and numbers relating to something called the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmAnKQOIdno"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Aquabahn""</a>.</p>
<p>Drexciya weren't just trafficking in metaphor and affect; they were telling a story, one worthy of its own blockbuster film. Their ""Aquabahn"" was, of course, a reference to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a>, whose robotic method act set an important precedent for Drexciya's own mythmaking. Played out across track titles and cover art, one sheets and liner notes, it went something like this: During the Middle Passage, many pregnant women, sick or dying or simply too much trouble for their captors, were thrown overboard. The fetuses in their wombs, still accustomed to a liquid environment, survived. They thrived, in fact, growing fins and gills, and made their home in the ruins of an underwater city, where they mounted their counter-offensive against human greed and stupidity.</p>
<p>The message fit with the militant stance of Detroit's <a href=""http://www.undergroundresistance.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Underground Resistance</a> label collective, with which Drexciya were affiliated, and so did their anonymity. When James Stinson died, in 2002, I'm willing to bet that most fans didn't even know his name, nor that of his collaborator Gerald Donald. Drexciya were rumored to be related to other shadowy electro projects of the era, like Elecktroids and Dopplereffekt-- a creepy, ostensibly antihumanist project featuring showroom dummies on its record covers and vocoded lyrics like ""We have to sterilize the population""-- but in the pre-Discogs era, this was all speculation. To immerse yourself in Drexciya's world was akin to following a particularly far-out comic book, where the misfits wrote the rules and justice always prevailed. It was punk as fuck, frankly-- but from an Afrofuturist perspective.</p>
<p>But for all the talk of combat, Drexciya's was profoundly joyful music: impish, rippling, unpredictable, and never anything less than profoundly funky. This is the first takeaway from <i>Journey of the Deep Sea Dweller I</i>. This first volume focuses on the group's first five years, drawing from seven EPs released on labels like Underground Resistance, Submerge, and Warp. (Some tracks have been anthologized before, on 1997's landmark double CD <i>The Quest</i>, but that's long out of print.) Certain tropes predominate: whip-cracking 808 drum patterns, squelchy synthesizer arpeggios, dissonant bleeps and creepy chromatic chord progressions. But there's nothing formulaic about these tracks, which range from the pensive funk of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3tu7FEcYRg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Aquarazorda""</a> to the double-time frenzy of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9y9Snt1g5E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hydro Theory""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1c540dCCEg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Beyond the Abyss""</a>; it's striking to realize how wildly Drexciya's tempos could vary, especially when compared to the deeply regimented BPMs of today's subgenres of electronic dance music. Indeed, Drexciya made few concessions to DJs: there are no 16-bar intros to facilitate mixing, and at least one point, you can hear a synthesizer pattern skip a beat, probably because one of the musicians leaned on his sequencer at the wrong time.</p>
<p>Lo-fi by today's standards, recorded straight to tape, in real time, with analog machines, Drexciya's sonics are unfailingly urgent and raw; there's more genuine menace in the roiling ""Sea Quake"" than in practically anything being made today. Clone's Alden Tyrell did a great job with the remastering, preserving the music's wide dynamic range and letting each frequency positively sizzle in space. As hair-raising as the songs can be, it's never an exhausting listen-- unlike too much contemporary electronic music, mastered so uniformly loud that it leaves your ears gasping for air.</p>
<p>It's easy to remember Drexciya primarily for their shtick. Academics love them for their applicability to concepts like Afrofuturism and the Black Atlantic. (Kodwo Eshun was particularly <a href=""http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/123/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">brilliant writing about Drexciya</a>; their slippery maneuvers served as the perfect foil for his own techno-theoretical poetics.) Detroit true-schoolers hold them up as examples of Motor City militancy and analog purism. These are all valid positions, but <i>Journey of the Deep Sea Dweller I</i> also reminds us of Drexciya's influence in other contexts, as well. The opening <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3nvnxWytWc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Welcome to Drexciya""</a> is a beatless burble that wouldn't sound out of place on a record from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, artists more commonly associated with the ""cosmic"" traditions of 1970s synthesizer music. Space is <i>a</i> place, sure. But to immerse yourself in Drexciya's underwater world is to be reminded that there are other dimensions just as worthy of exploration.</p>
<p>""Are Drexciyans water breathing, aquatically mutated descendants of those unfortunate victims of human greed?"" wrote a figure identified as the Unknown Writer in the liner notes to 1997's <i>The Quest</i>. ""Have they been spared by God to teach us or terrorize us? Did they migrate from the Gulf of Mexico to the Mississippi river basin and on to the great lakes of Michigan? Do they walk among us? Are they more advanced than us? How and why do they make their strange music? What is their Quest? These are many of the questions that you don’t know and never will. The end of one thing… and the beginning of another. Out.""</p>
<p>These questions had a different kind of resonance in the 1990s, before the answer to every question was just a click or two away, before every new ""anonymous"" artist felt like a walking, talking spoiler alert. To listen to Drexciya today is to wipe the slate clean. We may know James Stinson and Gerald Donald's names now, but their quest feels as cryptic as ever.</p></div>"|16175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16175-journey-of-the-deep-sea-dweller-i/|8.7|Philip Sherburne

So polarizing was its placement though, that editor-in-chief Tony Herrington felt obligated to <a href=""http://www.thewire.co.uk/themire/tag/james-ferraro"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crunch the numbers</a>.</p>
<p>I thought the album was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15992-james-ferraro-far-side-virtual/"">pretty good</a>. It's charming at times, and conceptually solid, so there isn't much to fault it for, unless you want to declare the entire conceit complete bullshit, which some have understandably done. ""Remember when you were a little kid dicking with your first Casio for 45 minutes?"" music critic Christopher Weingarten <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/1000TimesYes/status/132541243266826240"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>, ""James Ferraro does that onstage as a grown man.""</p>
<p><i>Far Side Virtual</i> also seemed critic-proof, which was frustrating. If you praised it, well, you were hip to its heady concept, though backed into such a corner that soon enough it may philosophically force you to give ""Best New Track"" to your iPhone's default ringtone. Negative reviews could be dismissed as the listener's simply not getting the joke.</p>
<p>Ferraro helped moderate reactions as well. Previously a mystery man without an email address and just a few interviews here and there (and a much noisier, more interesting sound), he went public, doing critics' heavy lifting himself by explicating the album's intentions to <i><a href=""http://fashion.elle.com/culture/2011/10/25/james-ferraros-versace-dreams/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elle</a></i>, <i><a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/07586-james-ferraro-far-side-virtual-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Quietus</a></i>, and many others. The guy went viral. He trolled his way into the music conversation. And just as <i>Far Side Virtual</i> inexplicably arrived on year-end lists, he put out a more obnoxious release: The free, victory-lap mixtape under the name Bebetune$.</p>
<p><i>Inhale C-4 $$$$$</i> finds Ferraro developing a mutant strain of mainstream rap and R&amp;B. Auto-Tune is mimicked, the skittering snares of radio rap show up, and there's special attention paid to the sloppy mastering and obnoxious DJ drops common on mixtapes. It turns out however, that hip-hop actually takes some finesse and knowledge to recreate-- and Ferraro just doesn't have the skills.</p>
<p>""Maccau Celebrities"" cribs its melody from T-Pain and Lil Wayne's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWBE0sQC5L8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Can't Believe It""</a>, and though it captures the sound of Wayne's syrup-drunk croons, there's no emotive charm. ""#GRINDLYFE"" has some of the demonic guitar-crunch grandiosity of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14771-flockaveli/"" target=""_blank"">Flockaveli</a></i> but does nothing with it, and ""H20"" squiggles around like a Timbaland rip-off. Then there's ""Street Dream$$"", a failed attempt at giving <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12130-glass-jar/"">Gang Gang Dance's ""Glass Jar""</a> the sample-slicing, drum pattern piling, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15566-electronic-dream/"">AraabMuzik</a> treatment. It features hi-hats and hand-claps, an airhorn, a dripping water sound, and some Drake-like Auto-Tune-- and it's a mess. Perhaps that's the point, though?</p>
<p>""Street Dream$$"" begins with ""I can hear everything. It's everything time,"" from ""Glass Jar"". It's a quote Ferraro has discussed before. In his interview with <i>The Quietus</i>, he compared the phrase to Nike's ""just do it,"" recommending GGD sell the phrase to Google. It's contemporary rap however, the sound Ferraro is either poorly approximating or lazily mocking, that truly embodies ""It's everything time."" Hip-hop has embraced ""the cloud"" like no other genre, pouring MP3s onto the internet with little interest in how they fit onto an 80-minute CD, running a flowering, free internet industry right alongside the desiccated major-label album landscape.</p>
<p>Instead of celebrating rap's industry-bucking impulse, Ferraro misreads the signs and signifiers of the mixtape world as amateurism. DJ and producer tags echoing around in the background of rap tracks not only serve a pragmatic function in an era of no liner notes, telling you who produced a track or put together the album, but add some chaos that can skyrocket an already awesome song onto another plateau. They're part of the fun.</p>
<p>In a 2010 interview with <i><a href=""http://hiphopgame.ihiphop.com/index2.php3?page=araabmuzik"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hip-Hop Game</a></i>, AraabMuzik explained his aesthetic choices: ""I never sampled off vinyl. I've always been digital with it. Mp3 quality. I'm not really with the cracks and the old-sounding, rough, rugged-type sound... I'm with the clear, quality sound."" See, hip-hop's tinny, digitized scream isn't a mistake-- it's a modern update of the golden era's warm, analog hiss.</p>
<p>Whether it's mainstream hitmaker Lex Luger and his snarling trap-rap <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8721-maximal-nation/"">maximalism</a>, or the gossamer, stoned-out electronica of internet beatmakers like the Block Beattaz and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42015-rising-clams-casino/"">Clams Casino</a>, it should occur to Ferraro that he's got a lot in common with rap's creative types. Or maybe he's aware of that and just has a snarky way of showing it.

One of dubstep's most influential pioneers, one of its diehard careerists, had made his own version of a house record (and this was before 2011 when it became the norm). In keeping with his usual heads-down dubstep, however, ""Croydon House"" was murky, dim-lit, and paranoid, not your standard garage-influenced thumper, and his tracks since have seen him navigate a no man's land of in-between tempos and experimental rhythms, culminating in the bewildering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16052-pinch-shackleton/"" target=""_blank"">Pinch and Shackleton collaborative album</a> at the end of last year. It goes beyond just productions: This summer, Pinch started incorporating house into his DJ sets, dedicating sections of his timeslots to the 4/4 stuff. Was he moving on from dubstep?</p>
<p>It's this many-limbed and flailing, vaguely house, vaguely techno hinterland that Rob Ellis' long-overdue entry in the <i>Fabriclive</i> mix series occupies: The drums still swing and shake with that tribal energy that marks his best dubstep work, but there's not always the snare on the third, and sometimes there's a four-to-the-floor kick. The mix begins mid-track and cleverly continues the conceptual current that's been running through commercial mix CDs as of late: think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15830-fabriclive-59/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet's own <i>Fabriclive</i></a> go for a similar example of artiness run amok in a dance mix. The nervily pulsating throb of Atlanta producer Distal's ""Venom"" both opens <i>and</i> closes the set, sealing it into a closed circle that, at least in its peripheries, raises questions about the linearity of mixes in the first place. There's an obvious left-to-right motion here, but there's no grand closer, pensive opener, or any real climax: Left to its own devices, Pinch's mix never <i>really</i> ends, the same bumpy journey over and over again, bubbling and bubbling but refusing to boil over. Does it <i>need</i> to end for it to be a satisfying product? According to Pinch, apparently not.</p>
<p>This little tweak allows Ellis to play around with the sequencing, and <i>Fabriclive 61 </i>begins with a gallop, running through a surprisingly techno-tinged opening stretch, with French producer F's overlooked (and hugely inventive) ""Slow Down"" colliding with Shed's latest in his rave-techno EQD alias: it's an almost confrontational greeting from someone once associated with the purest of dubstep, and a true sign of the times for both the genre and one of its most prominent heroes.  The mix continues in this vein before fading out into beatless-near silence with Roly Porter's gorgeous mechano-classical ""Hessra""-- at which point Pinch's remix of Photek's ""Acid Reign"" storms out, bringing the mix into more familiar 140-bpm dubstep territory.</p>
<p>Where some recent dubstep mixes like Youngsta's <i>Rinse</i> CD or Distance's <i>Dubstep Allstars Vol. </i><i>8 </i>were fine showcases of the genre's steadfast traditionalist communities, they were nevertheless tainted by the genre's turn inward (or the formulaic). Pinch's selection of pounding kicks, crash-landing snares, and LFO growls, however, sound both more vital and crucially more alien(ating) than ever. His choice of producers is impeccable, mixing in old stalwarts who are at career highs (Distance's sound is as mean as its ever been, and Goth-Trad's lost in some LSD rabbithole) and producers like Roska and Addison Groove who provide strange, unconventional takes on the median dubstep tempo. It's the most exciting 30 minutes of relatively pure ""dubstep"" since Appleblim's career-defining <i>Dubstep Allstars Vol. 6, </i>taking that staggered ""dungeon sound"" and infusing it with all the psychological paranoia and jagged, jigsaw-puzzle rhythms that defined his own best work, both dubstep and otherwise.</p>
<p>So how do we get from dubstep back to whatever Distal's ""Venom"" is supposed to be? Ellis one-ups the ""Hessra"" play, dropping the loping limp of Illum Sphere's ""Promise a Secret""-- a tightknit blend of hyper-compressed string samples that's eventually gutted by Distal's more assertive track-- on top of Om Unit's jerky ""Pressure"". Which brings us right back to where we started, traversing the most current iterations of the bass music continuum as viewed through Pinch's dusty, obsidian lens.</p>
<p>What makes the halving between tempos less jarring is Pinch's distinct aesthetic: the music here is damaged, blackened, and always foreboding, no matter what tempo it's pounding at or what genre it might be interrogating. That unrelenting blackness can be suffocating, and it's definitely unfriendly, but it's never boring-- which is a lot more than you can say about most ""dubstep"" mixes these days. So while Pinch might not have moved on from dubstep completely, he's definitely moved <i>somewhere</i>, and it sounds like an exciting place to be.</p></div>"|16127.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16127-fabriclive61/|7.5|Andrew Ryce

High productivity is common among laptop-wielding bedroom auteurs, but Lacey's no data dumper. Each release exhibits unity and care-- its own twist on a rapidly developing sound. The first one I discovered, before anyone knew much about Arrange, was <i>Plantation</i>, which I <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15534-plantation/"">said</a> was ""thoroughly a breakup record."" But I was wrong.</p>
<p>Now that Lacey has done a little press-- such as <a href=""http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/countygrind/2011/06/qa_arrange_malcom_lacey.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this interview</a> with a South Florida weekly-- we know more. His first instrument was the piano; he's more inclined to slave over his ambient textures in private than to play shows in public; he likes <a href=""http://typerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Type Records</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius/"">Perfume Genius</a>. None of this was surprising. But one assertion caught me off guard: ""Most of my lyrical content stems itself from an abusive childhood and the relationship I share with my incarcerated father,"" with whom <i>Plantation</i> standout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12207-whend-you-find-me/"">""When'd You Find Me?""</a> was a ""one-way conversation.""</p>
<p>The revelation casts new light on Lacey's lyrics, which draw opposed qualities-- hostility and tenderness, discretion and confession, self-hatred and self-help-- into uneasy truces. (He'd have fit in well on <a href=""http://saddle-creek.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Saddle Creek</a> in the early 2000s.) On new EP <i>Five Years With the Sun</i>, Lacey is even more furtive than on <i>Plantation</i>, his halting voice washing in and out of audibility, and vanishing for long periods. In hushed tones, he dramatizes the process of a gentle person grappling with dark thoughts-- now scathing, now contrite, lashing out and lashing in. His reticence comes to seem like an impulse for self-erasure, which makes the moments when he overcomes it feel especially poignant.</p>
<p>Is this palpable struggle what distinguishes Arrange from a thousand similar peers? It certainly isn't the music's substance, a fairly standard amalgamation of synth-pop, shoegaze, ambient, chillwave, and hip-hop. Nor is it any iconoclastic style-- to the contrary, I prize its preternatural patience and humility. And Lacey is already developing a go-to track structure, which has a smoothly churning undercarriage of piano or guitar tones, ranks of juicy synthetic plucks pulsing above, and mechanical drums splashing the edges of the beats; all topped off with a synth lead that flaps like a tattered banner in a sluggish wind.</p>
<p>Maybe it's something even harder to quantify: that vigilant, moody, quietly rapturous sensibility. While the orders of the day are pleasantly zoned-out or ethereally spiritual, Lacey's music feels almost feverishly alert, with breath-catching pauses and mercurial embellishments calling for close attention to its dreamy flow. Below the <a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kompakt</a>-isms, one hears the dulcet, revolving intervals of the lullaby. This is music as a ward or charm, its hermetic regularity holding a safe space against chaos. (It was recorded, I'm told, in a walk-in closet.) It doesn't sound like a young man hunting for blog buzz. It sounds like a personal search for redemption, or at least some consolation, one moment at a time.</p>
<p>Careful sequencing makes <i>Five Years With the Sun</i> feel like an act of tentative revelation through gradual ascent. The immediate pop songs are divided by obscure but quirkily elegant set pieces: ""Gone With the Snow"", where bizarrely treated vocals ride over glassy swells; ""Airplane Notes"", a study in nocturnal counterpoint. The force gathered on the first half rises to a vertex on ""Cure"", a burly production where Lacey opens up his voice with unaccustomed extroversion. ""Mt. Rainer"" vividly evokes traveling up switchbacks, the winds and vistas bending around, leading us up to the bright, clear peak of closer <a href=""http://arrange.bandcamp.com/track/sun-showers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sun Showers""</a>, where all the album's fogs dispel.</p>
<p>""There's a glow/ and I can feel it,"" Lacey sings plainly, ""deep below the hollow point of me."" A couple of inaudibly murmured lines later, we hear, ""the way I felt when I first heard it say…"" But the thought goes unfinished. Instead, a long instrumental passage culminates in a weary guitar anthem, then peters out into running waters. He's not the type to make a sound just to fill space; he waits until he knows what he has to say. That's what keeps me hanging on every moment. Enticingly, the open-ended conclusion of <i>Five Years With the Sun </i>promises more striving, more growth, more suffering and deliverance to come.</p></div>"|16159.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16159-five-years-with-the-sun/|7.2|Brian Howe

Ah, but note the subtitle: ""<i>The Pinkerton Years.</i>"" It's a powerful but potentially dangerous sales pitch. <i>Alone III </i>comes sidelong with <i>The Pinkerton Diaries</i>, a $75 (and thus collectors-only) volume that compiles Cuomo's ""journals, emails, letters, photos, and school papers"" from the <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14817-pinkerton-deluxe-edition-death-to-false-metal/"" target=""_blank"">Pinkerton</a></i> era and offers ""an intimate look into the writing and recordings of Rivers Cuomo from 1994-1997."" Which threatens not only redundancy but a complete undermining of <i>Pinkerton</i>'s integrity<i>. </i>""I thought <i>Pinkerton was </i>Cuomo's diary,"" you might be thinking. ""He was holding back on us? <i>Editing</i>?"" Does this compromise the perceived purity of such a powerful record?</p>
<p>Then again, <i>Pinkerton </i>has always been accompanied by a healthy serving of half-truths, tall tales, and revisionist history. But you can see why so many want to give it a protected status: Cuomo was far more embarrassed by its <i>Billboard</i> failure than anything he actually said on <i>Pinkerton</i>, and his output since then has been the work of someone with severe commercial abandonment issues. But <i>Alone III </i>doesn't feel like a cash-in like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14817-pinkerton-deluxe-edition-death-to-false-metal/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pinkerton </i>reissue</a> or 2010's Memories Tour, in which the band (minus bassist Matt Sharp) played their first two albums in full. No, this is something else entirely. With its whiplash sequencing (26 tracks in far less than an hour), low production values, minute-long asides, and pause-record tape overdubs, <i>Alone III</i> seems to ask: What would've happened if Rivers Cuomo had wanted to be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3353-robert-pollard/"" target=""_blank"">Robert Pollard</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/586-lou-barlow/"" target=""_blank"">Lou Barlow</a> for the rest of the 90s?</p>
<p>So if you value these archaeological digs as an opportunity to construct an alternate band history, <i>Alone III </i>is easily Cuomo's most worthwhile project since<i>, </i>well, <i>Pinkerton. </i>But what's truly surprising is that it satisfies in actuality as much as it does in theory, and not just because it puts a bunch of <i>Pinkerton </i>songs in the mix. <i>Alone III </i>actually deconstructs that record by spreading out into three sections, providing anchors for Cuomo's mini-suite ambitions rather than the lead-up to <i>Pinkerton</i>'s autobiographical payoff (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mxEoA3G9Wg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Across the Sea""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkroIXktjgE&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Good Life""</a>). Fully formed but raw-as-hell versions of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCUD52feOmg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Getchoo""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phDuvBk_9ok"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tired of Sex""</a> mesh easily with Cuomo's off-the-cuff material and allow <i>Alone III </i>to exist in its own orbit as a no-fi, freewheeling, and ultimately <i>fun </i>record that either Geffen or Weezer wouldn't allow themselves to ever release in the midst of the record industry's then-booming economy.</p>
<p>Even with the impression that Cuomo is dipping into his private stock, a lot of this will be familiar to non-diehards, like the two-minute surge of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-U9RrSS4yg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Gave Your Love to Me Softly""</a> that leans to the latter side of ""pop-punk"" and could've replaced <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUm5-1x1LfA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Why Bother?""</a> on <i>Pinkerton</i> with a 180-degree attitude change. And it's tough to imagine Weezer ever pulling off something like ""Lisa"". Its blues-bend Kiss riffs would've been employed too smirkingly, its charming chorus harmonies polished to anonymity, and its lyric about a workplace crush (""I wish I didn't work for you/ All we ever seem to do is business/ Read and sign and fax this"") extended beyond its means into dad-humor.</p>
<p>So those are the reasons why <i>III </i>is the most like an actual Weezer album of any of the <i>Alone</i> records, and the least like a Cuomo yard sale. But the real pleasure is in how <i>Alone III </i>casts the creative up-ramp to <i>Pinkerton </i>as an inspired if not always productive time for Cuomo-- you can practically visualize his brain giddily whirring with a flood of new ideas and classicist ambitions. Sure, there are 50-second sketches that have limited replay value outside of <i>Alone III</i>, but they keep the end-to-end listen brisk and pleasurable. Elsewhere, some songs are so self-explanatory and complete that they don't need much elaboration (""I'm So Lonely on a Saturday Night""), others crash into a dead end (""Oh God, I'm Hungry"", ""The End of My String""), and of course, some are just flat out unlistenable (""What Is This I Find?"").</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/rivers-cuomo-theres-so-much-pain-my-voice"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In a <i>Spin</i> interview leading up to <i>Pinkerton</i>'s re-release</a>, Cuomo expressed why he enjoyed going back to these tapes even though he's far more excited by his new material, saying ""I was really touched by the emotion in my voice… there's so much sensitivity and pain."" <i>Alone III</i>'s last track would seem to reiterate that: On ""One Glorious Moment"", Cuomo gives a post-operation captain's log, confiding to a tape recorder, ""I actually peed for the first time on my own… it was a glorious moment. I'm going to try to set up some music to listen to, goodbye."" That candor can be seen as being every bit as self-obsessed and pandering as <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14652-hurley/"" target=""_blank"">Hurley</a> </i>or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14817-pinkerton-deluxe-edition-death-to-false-metal/"" target=""_blank"">Death to False Metal</a></i>, but that last line sticks out. <i>Alone III</i> is a bracing, imperfect reminder of a time when music was something Cuomo just couldn't live without.</p></div>"|16152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16152-alone-iii-the-pinkerton-years/|7.3|Ian Cohen

When the German outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3187-oval/"" target=""_blank"">Oval</a>-- early on reduced to founding member Markus Popp-- made its return in 2010 with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14592-o/"" target=""_blank"">O</a></i>, it was hard to decide how to react. Especially since <i>O</i> was one of its most difficult and fussy efforts yet, and largely divorced from Oval's previously established and instantly recognizable aesthetic as heard on landmarks like <i>94 Diskont</i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6066-ovalcommers/"" target=""_blank"">Ovalcommers</a></i>. With a palette based on the sound of live instruments, <i>O</i> lacked some of the algorithmic wizardry of Popp's best work and was a fatiguingly lengthy listen either way. You'd be forgiven for thinking that <i>OvalDNA</i>, coming just a year later and clocking in with another 25 tracks-- and this after the complementary 15-track 12"" <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14368-oh-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Oh</a></i>-- is something like overkill.</p>
<p>Here's the surprise: <i>OvalDNA</i> is actually a collection of bits and bytes from assorted Oval eras past. The even bigger surprise? While it indeed sounds like the old Oval we know and love, there's nothing even remotely scatterbrained or assorted about this one. Not only is <i>OvalDNA</i> remarkably consistent and thematically sound, it's so well-sequenced that its 25 tracks fly by in a glorious, easygoing blur, a far cry from that fatal fragmentation that ate away at <i>O</i>. Its variety renders these sounds in a fluid and volatile technicolor missing from even early records like <i>Systemisch</i>. In a way, it's the best of both Oval worlds.  Included in the package is a DVD with ten bonus tracks, a music video, a documentary, and 2000 AIFF files of sounds and elements from the entirety of Popp's musical output ""intended for music producers.""  Okay, so maybe it's a little overkill, but coming from an artist who made a public installation inviting people to render their own interpretations of his work (as part of 2000's <i>Ovalprocess</i>), it shouldn't really come as a surprise either.</p>
<p>Like so much of this music, sometimes it's hard to tell whether or not the decay and destruction that pries apart the layers is accidental or planned, but here the manipulation feels effortless, executed with a smart and steady hand. There are many varieties of Oval on offer, though it's most often a warm-hued, even honeyed sound palette rather than the acerbic distortion of, say, <i>Ovalcommers</i>. While some tracks like ""Savvy"" do focus on harsher, more challenging sounds, even these-- or the hushed, rushed thermal swooshing of ""70 Kino"" and its choked string section-- feel oddly accommodating. <i>OvalDNA</i> doesn't dip into the same well of asceticism as the conceptually driven sound-design experiments you'll find on labels like <a href=""http://milleplateaux1.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mille Plateaux</a> or <a href=""http://www.raster-noton.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Raster-Noton</a>; instead, each stutter and skip feels melodically driven, each sample caught and clipped mid-moment like a key to some larger world of musical delights that we're given glimpses of but are never actually led to-- dig the teases at jungle on ""Mare Fax""-- on account of the album's sprightly pace.</p>
<p>Even if it can be a tease, some moments on <i>OvalDNA</i> are downright welcoming: It's hard to think of anything from Oval since the legendary <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpWU_Nrwe10"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Do While""</a> as beautiful as ""Australasia"". One of the album's more compositionally complete tracks, it juggles jerkily plucked strings, organs that whir to life before being pulled apart into groaning rumbles, and drums that stutter across the stereo spectrum at random. That might sound like a mess, but the elements just <i>slightly</i> coalesce to form a stirring, heart-tugging refrain gently morphing over the track's three-and-a-half minutes, a chief example of the accidental alchemy of <i>OvalDNA. </i>""Octaeder 0.2"", which formed the centerpiece to Oval's live contribution to the Henri Pousseur tribute <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6523-4-parabolic-mixes-with-main-philip-jeck-and-oval/"" target=""_blank"">4 Parabolic Mixes</a></i>, proves the emotional potential of these flurries of compressed ones and zeroes, while the more recent Oval material is at least coincidentally referenced with a number of tracks that make live-instrument samples their focus (""Credit Line""), stumbling on an odd hybrid of acoustic and computerized sounds in the process, like twang rendered with right angles.</p>
<p>Approachability is one thing, and <i>OvalDNA</i> has it in spades, but there's also the issue of relevance: Can a veteran act in a largely outmoded genre still command attention with an outtakes collection? Certainly, any fan of Oval (particularly those lapsed after <i>O</i>) will find a lot to love in <i>OvalDNA</i>'s gentle reassurances, but even for a newcomer, these sounds are idiosyncratic and stimulating enough to get lost in. <i>OvalDNA</i> is curiously timeless, as if these tracks were encased in amber, still holding that intriguingly alien gleam and shine as back in Oval's halcyon days, even polished up a little nicer this time. It might not be something we knew we still needed, but at the least, <i>OvalDNA</i> is a solid addition to the canon of one of the most innovative electronic acts of the 1990s.</p></div>"|16138.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16138-ovaldna/|8.3|Andrew Ryce

In case you were wondering, yes, New York is still a brutal, bewildering, dizzying place to try and make it as a rapper, and yes, keeping up with rap nowadays is still basically a full-time job.</p>
<p>That said, I've had more fun listening to Vado (that's Violence and Drugs Only, if you're curious) in the past two years than I have almost anyone else. He's funnier than French Montana and a much better rapper than Murda. Most of the fun stems from the sheer, bellowing-gasbag sound of Vado's voice, which cuts through basically anything you put in front of it. He's a whoopee cushion of infectious ignorance, and he has a class clown's way with ensuring his remarks travel all the way to the front of the room. But he's also a crafty rapper, and his latest mixtape, <i>Slime Flu 2</i>, delivers exactly what the original <i>Slime Flu</i> did-- high-speed, tightly realized, pugilistic goon rap-- to nearly as entertaining results.</p>
<p>If it suffers at all, it's largely because it feels and sounds too rushed-out, perhaps in an attempt to re-spark Vado's fast-cooling buzz. He should have kept the album in production for a few more minutes-- even for a free rap mixtape, the mastering is atrocious. The beats knock, but even with headphones,  they seem to be bumping through a neighbor's wall, and Vado's voice often sounds distractingly disembodied in the mix. This is odd and regrettable, since the first <i>Slime Flu</i> banged loud and clear wherever you played it, but there is still lots to enjoy. Top honors goes to Vado's ""inspiration"" joint, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPAxFkGDaMA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I See You (Black People)""</a>, which surely deserves an award for mind-blowing use of a song-title parenthetical. The song, built on a sepia-tinted piano loop and hand percussion, all but dims the lights and burns the incense, but apart from a single Obama namedrop, Vado's not having it: ""Didn't notice, recession happened when?""</p>
<p>This irrepressible goofiness is the key to Vado's charm. Give him a beat, any beat, and he'll bludgeon his way through it like Yosemite Sam, shooting in all directions. On <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zud6gz9ixSQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Slime Anthem""</a>, he reinforces his loose Diplomats affiliation by putting together a blatant homage to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cb0h4Jlx70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dipset (Santana's Town)""</a>, and his eyeball-rattling shouting is a dead ringer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4044-juelz-santana/"" target=""_blank"">Juelz Santana</a>'s. But his crisp way with words also allows him to kick gnarled, writerly raps alongside a mumbling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3634-raekwon/"" target=""_blank"">Raekwon</a> on the very Raekwonishly titled <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxyNsEqHBzY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bed Piss""</a> without ever sounding young or out of his depth. He can kick funny, credible game to ladies when he feels like it without turning syrupy or abandoning his rap style, just like his mentor Cam'ron (who, by the way, Vado kept from the stage this time) on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpmW8SiF6TI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Louis V. Bag""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ4LwpyFY0g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All the Drama""</a>. There are a couple of fun surprises, too: freestyles over <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXBPtcd2eTU&amp;feature=fvst"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ms. Fat Booty""</a> (he calls it <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYdkoViO9B8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ms. Slime Booty""</a>, which he should have maybe rethought) and the plush beat from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9647-kingdom-come/"" target=""_blank"">Kingdom Come</a></i>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVUpq4ML5ic&amp;feature=fvst"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Prelude""</a>, one of that album's few salvageable numbers.</p>
<p>Absolutely none of this is earth-shaking, nor does it carry that burning sense of <i>now</i> that keeps the frenetic pulse of street-rap moving forward. But Vado will be okay; New York may devour its own, but if he can keep putting out solid projects like this one once or twice a year, he can count on a small, local-hero following. Maybe there's a Lloyd Banks-style <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTR7yvONCV8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Beamer, Benz or Bentley""</a> surprise hit for dude four or five years down the line. It would make me happy to see. Every city needs a solid B-team.</p></div>"|16146.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16146-vado-slime-flu-2/|7.2|Jayson Greene

But its legacy had a big bang. It came in the form of an unnamed <a href=""http://98bowery.com/conceptualartist/lives/bands-flyer.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">festival</a> at Manhattan's Artists Space, spanning five nights in May 1978. Brian Eno happened to attend, and what he saw and heard led him to produce <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2105-no-new-york/"">No New York</a></i>, a scene-defining sampler that remains the most well-known no wave record. Some claim it also helped kill the scene, but it's doubtful that any of the music would have such a strong ongoing influence without Eno's compilation.</p>
<p>Though <i>No New York</i> included some great work from its four participants-- the Contortions, Teenage Jesus &amp; the Jerks, Mars, and DNA-- no wave fanatics have longed for audio documentation of the Artists Space festival itself, and rumors have persisted that tapes exist. In 2008 two Teenage Jesus songs from the fest showed up on a <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12239-shut-up-and-bleed/"">new collection</a> of their work, but that's been it. Now Feeding Tube has worked with Mars bassist Mark Cunningham to offer the entirety of his band's two-set performance on a single LP.</p>
<p>It's fitting that Mars are the first Artists Space participants to get such a release, because the quartet's 1975 beginnings made them technically the first no wave band. But their elemental importance goes beyond mere chronology. Inside their brief lifespan lie the deconstructive, anti-careerist seeds that drove the movement. Cunningham saw their arc as ""a countdown from ten to one,"" and through their sliver of recorded output-- 11 songs totaling barely over a half-hour-- the tired rules of rock got pummeled into abstract art-noise.</p>
<p>The same goes for the two sets here, each of which takes up an album side and contains identical songs and running order. When the band revs up with ""3E"" and ""Helen Fordsdale"", their riffy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvet Underground</a> leanings are apparent beneath amp distortion and vocal squalls. But only a few minutes later, singer Sumner Crane babbles and growls unintelligibly, guitarist China Burg lights string fireworks, and every shard of sound melts like a pile of wicked witches. That path of destruction is even more intense in the darker, nastier-sounding second set. It culminates in a brutal take on ""Tunnel"", as Crane's insane howls make the studio version sound like a dance remix.</p>
<p>Oddly, for a band this wild and abstract, such divergence is rather rare here. Most songs are played live the way Mars played them in the studio, a testament to how controlled and honed their seemingly chaotic music actually was. Where you can hear a difference is in fidelity. <i>Live at Artists Space </i>is somewhat tinny and flat, in a way that could wear out uninitiated ears. Part of that can be chalked up to dated source material. But the second set was recorded on professional equipment by the band's label head, Charles Ball, leading <a href=""http://weaselwalter.blogspot.com/2011/12/guest-record-review-mars-live-at.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">some</a> to suggest reasonably that more mastering care (as well as more imagination in the cover design) could have improved this record significantly.</p>
<p>Still, Mars' performances during that now-legendary weekend are powerful enough to shine through technical limitations. Because their time was so short, the band spent each moment at a high pitch. All their spilling energy had real purpose-- to show how quickly and thoroughly rock could be demolished using the tools that built it. <i>Live at Artists Space </i>may hiss, but it also crackles with that enervated inspiration. If it's mostly for aficionados, that's ok-- anyone interested in Mars at all is likely a devotee.</p></div>"|16166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16166-live-at-artists-space/|6.8|Marc Masters

Not that a second volume would be unwelcome; it's that we're in the midst of a run in which most compilations (from the big houses, at least) are weighty, extra-long attempts to define a genre, rep a label, or map a career. They are, in other words, short historical arcs offered by a scene that is still learning how to manage its past. In this context, <i>All Stars</i> is a breath of fresh air, purporting to offer nothing more than a glimpse of the current house music talent operating in or originating from Amsterdam, <a href=""http://rushhourmusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rush Hour</a>'s home base since 1997.</p>
<p>The 12 exclusive tracks offered here are, as advertised, a set of raucous, 4/4 shakers born in the 1980s in Chicago but possessing updated wardrobes. Given the label it's hardly a surprise, but it bears mentioning that <i>All Stars</i> has absolutely nothing to do with the squeaky arena-fodder known as ""Dirty Dutch"" or Dutch House. <i>All Stars</i> might plausibly be presented as an alternative were it not for the fact that the very existence of labels like Rush Hour and their fanbases are testaments to the desire for substitutes. (If a massive Afrojack fan hears this comp and has her eureka moment, I'll swear off colored vinyl for a year.)</p>
<p>On the whole <i>All Stars</i> is dense and bold, casting off any minimalist impulses in favor of buzzy machinations that rely on manicured loops in lieu of samples. I hesitate to describe this as an ""Amsterdam sound,"" as it's more likely the result of a youth-oriented lineup. Dexter, Melon, and Newworldaquarium constitute the old guard here, the latter's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_0Y3ZECEvg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Liberty Hot""</a> being the comp's most sexual and incisive rhythm. But really the show is in the hands of contemporaries like Tom Trago, whose foggy, see-sawing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvg-SM8khpw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Once Upon a Time in Amsterdam""</a> stirs my urban Euro fetishism, and the perpetually on-the-verge Juju &amp; Jordash, whose brushed-steel drum programming is refreshingly aggressive. The standout newcomer is Maxi Mill, a producer confident enough to stop momentum mid-track to make way for a burr-laden bassline.</p>
<p>There are too many rote sawing strings and punchy synth pads, but Rush Hour proves that Amsterdam is big enough to supply the talent and small enough to prevent <i>All Stars</i> from seeming unwieldy or obvious. If there's an overarching goal here it appears to be to convince you that you could have a good time at an Amsterdam club on a Thursday without a touring DJ in town. Used-CD bins are stuffed with obscure and ultra-specific house compilations from the early 90s. <i>All Stars</i>' small-ball focus is a throwback in this way; five years from now it will likely offer little utility, though I wouldn't make the same bet about the artists contained herein.</p></div>"|16169.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16169-rush-hour-presents-amsterdam-all-stars/|6.4|Andrew Gaerig

A week after the show, <i>Nevermind</i> would crack the Top 40. A month later, it would be certified Gold. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Smells Like Teen Spirit""</a> was climbing to alarming heights on the <i>Billboard</i> chart.  There was an imposing phalanx of video cameras present at the venue, to capture the gig in its entirety. The band was, understandably, a little freaked.</p>
<p>There is plenty of live Nirvana already available to us: the half-hearted-feeling rush job that was <i>From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah</i> in 1996; the commercial release, last year, of the beloved bootleg <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13686-bleach-deluxe-edition-live-at-reading/"" target=""_blank"">Live at Reading</a></i>; the <i>Unplugged</i> record. But the joy of <i>Live at the Paramount</i> is hearing the charge of this moment: a great band newly famous, still reeling and flooded with nervy adrenaline. Every single song on this setlist has already been featured once, or more, on some other Nirvana live record. But it's still invaluable.</p>
<p>Kurt's voice sounds remarkably powerful here: He sang in a way that was obviously unsustainable, even with the aid of heavy cough syrup, and there's a thrill, although a slightly selfish one, of hearing his voice rip the air before he had begun to scream it down to the threads. His peculiar, yowling phrasing may have been a deliberate choice, or it might have been the only way he managed to wrangle those notes from a constricted voice box, but there is a terrible, riveting intensity to it: Words feel torn from him, bearing fishhooks on their way out. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvwqSMRtoSI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Aneurysm""</a>'s ""Love you so much/ It makes me sick"" becomes ""Laahve yeww sowl much et makes me SECK."" It physically hurts to hear, as it always has, but it gives you some of the most committed, clear performances of Nirvana's canonical songs as you're likely to get.</p>
<p>There is some time-capsule fun to have listening to <i>Paramount</i>-- one of the biggest cheers is for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa30bdEXNeM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""School""</a>! Krist Novoselic makes a wince-inducing ""Smile, you're on 'Candid Camera'"" joke! But the album's queerest, and most fascinating, punk-rock sociological moment comes from the protracted lead-up to ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", which was already the elephant in the room. You can practically see the feet-dragging and hand-twisting that leads up to it, like antsy kids being herded into Sunday service.</p>
<p>First, Novoselic makes some noncommittal crack about the absence of Halloween constumes in the crowd (""unless you're all supposed to be punk rockers."") Then they play ""Floyd the Barber"", one of the least melodic and sludgiest songs in the catalog. Afterward, a time-killing little tongue-in-cheek instrumental jam. Then, Novoselic's voice cuts back into the mic, as he hollers, curiously, ""White boy funk sucks!"" Only after all this fidgeting is finished do those chords fire up. In the moment you can hear roaring to life the enormous machine that would, less than a year later, take <i>Nevermind</i> to multi-platinum status. The version is anything but noncommittal-- Cobain leans into every ""a denial"" harder than the last.  It's exhilarating and poignant. You can hear they still unambiguously love this song, even if it was starting to make things complicated for them.</p></div>"|16162.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16162-nirvana-live-at-the-paramount/|8.8|Jayson Greene

It's a descriptor that itself holds a load of other nebulous, subjective ideas, such as ""success,"" ""relevance,"" and the notion of a ""primary band."" But with musicians-- especially nowadays-- being prone to enlist in three or four groups at a time, devoting a fairly even amount of attention to all of them, is there any way to logically keep track of which bands are bands and which bands are side-projects or supergroups?</p>
<p>Total Control are as close to a supergroup as a tandem of cult Australian punks can get. Each member is involved in another band, the most well-known of which being guitarist Mikey Young's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28433-eddy-current-suppression-ring/"" target=""_blank"">Eddy Current Suppression Ring</a>-- which, if you only have a passing knowledge of current garage-rock, can elicit the same sort of confused blank stare as if you told someone your band's most famous member also plays in the Growlers. Thankfully, when mild obscurity is on a group's side, they are allowed few expectations to conquer and the chance to legitimately surprise people. But even if you're intimately familiar with Eddy Current Suppression Ring, UV Race, Straightjacket Nation, and the Collapse, <i>Henge Beat</i> is startlingly good; good enough to surpass even the top-shelf efforts from the members' other bands.</p>
<p>As you might expect from a band named after <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHcgBz1GvIQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a six-minute Motels single</a>, Total Control possess a rich knowledge of a very specific point in music history. Though bearing no resemblance to the song in which they've derived their name, most of their key influences were very much active in 1979, the year the single was released. Opener ""See More Glass"" is indebted to Suicide's second self-titled album. Shades of late-period Roxy Music can be found in closer ""Love Performance"". Wire, the Buzzcocks, Joy Division, and Swell Maps all slow up in the strands of Total Control's DNA.</p>
<p>But if <i>Henge Beat</i> were simply a 36-minute post-punk genre exercise, it wouldn't be nearly as entertaining. The band explores a different realm of possibilities in every song, punctuating creeping lurches with ear-splitting explosions and delivering spacey instrumentals not incredibly far removed from elevator music right after. ""The Hammer"" is eerie, black-clad darkwave. ""Shame Thugs"" sounds like alternate title screen music for beloved Super Nintendo RPG <i>EarthBound</i>. ""No Bibs"" comes off like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SST_Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SST</a> hardcore thrown into vertigo. (If you have an older sibling that grew up in the 1980s and passed you all of their coolest punk records when they went off to college, give them a copy of <i>Henge Beat</i> and they may shed actual tears of joy.)</p>
<p>As if the ultra-cohesive fusion of punk music's fruitful first decade wasn't enough, Dan Stewart (Straightjacket Nation) makes for a compelling frontman, a lyricist weaned on Salinger and Philip K. Dick whose vocal range stays in the pocket but exhibits a great deal of versatility regardless. His taste in literature proves that he knows the value of a good narrator: The greedy factory owner in ""Retiree"" barks, ""keep them at work,"" in an icy, robotic tone while looking at a gold watch ticking down the days. ""Meds II"" captures the redundancy of self-medicated culture-- through methods both legal and otherwise-- with the lyric, ""Taking pills to remember to take pills to forget.""</p>
<p>""Love Performance"" can sound glittery and optimistic due to its blinking neon synths and ""these are not the last days"" refrain, but it's actually a rumination on our fantasies of being eulogized (""In the last days, they'll sing your praise""), finding Stewart pitching rocks at the celebratory stance of the supposedly righteous whenever they think the world's number is being called (think Y2k, the rapture, the end of the Mayan calendar). Album centerpiece ""Carpet Rash"" finds Stewart at his most detached vocally while crafting an array of evocative imagery (""Drinking detergent and licking the walls/ Eating your breakfast in shower stalls""), writing a song that fully embodies how desperate, unfulfilling, and hopeless sex can sometimes be.</p>
<p>Throughout the entirety of <i>Henge Beat</i>, there is a sharp fluidity in all of its elements, from the interplay of the band's members to its lyrical concepts. In spite of being primarily described as a composite of members from other groups, Total Control display the kind of unity that veteran bands take years to cultivate. They make you realize that a lot of the best ""supergroups"" are merely regular old groups with members noteworthy for being excellent at what they do.</p></div>"|16143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16143-henge-beat/|7.8|Martin Douglas

Unless you're a legit polymath, it's as easy to spread yourself thin as it is to create compelling work across several spectra. Polymath may still be in play for Sam Shepherd: In addition to his work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28145-floating-points/"" target=""_blank"">Floating Points</a>, he's a classically trained musician, (outré-)jazz enthusiast and bandleader, an in-demand DJ, and a PhD candidate in molecular genetics. He is the brainy, footloose heir to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>'s wild-eyed beatsmith throne (London seat). In addition to his range, it's tempting to let these activities tell us something else about Shepherd: They all point toward studious refinement. <i>Shadows</i>, a 2x12"" nearing 40 minutes in length, suggests that Shepherd continues to filter his approach to rhythm and melody.</p>
<p>To date Shepherd's varying output has bordered on the maximal. The <i>Vacuum</i> EP-- still one of the finest slabs of vinyl to emerge from a London scene that also gave birth to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28029-joy-orbison/"" target=""_blank"">Joy O</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14927-night-slugs-allstars-volume-1/"" target=""_blank"">Night Slugs</a>-- found him painting outside the lines of house and bass music, spreading squelchy melodies that owed more to hippie jazz than club music. Since then he's remained sneakily busy, releasing a handful of tracks that sound generally brighter and more musical than those of his peers. In contrast, when <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRR_DeoILzo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sais (Dub)""</a> dropped on Record Store Day last year, it sounded as if someone had jammed a mute into his trumpet: The track's smoky symphony of bass and beats barely hinted at his ever-present jazz melodies (an even more modest edit of ""Sais"" closes <i>Shadows</i>).</p>
<p>A less generous reader of <i>Shadows</i> might skip ""refinement"" altogether and arrive at ""retreat."" The record-- which represents the longest, most cohesive release Shepherd has offered-- sounds polite at low volumes (at most volumes, actually), and I wouldn't blame anyone for mistaking it for a headphone record. But <i>Shadows</i> benefits from volume; open air and clean walls amplify its details. Over the course of five long, progressive tracks, Shepherd offers a series of minor orchestrations, layering tasteful slabs of jazz (I'm assuming they're samples) over a dense crosshatch of bass and drum sequences. There are extended passages during which he offers little more than drum patterns at competing frequencies; ""Obfuse"" looms for more than three minutes before it hints at true melody.</p>
<p>Elsewhere Shepherd is more forward. ""ARP3"" piles tasteful electronic keyboard over a sinister bassline that alternates between five and seven notes of passive evil. Any (sonic) ties Shepherd still has to London's bass scene can be seen in moments like ""ARP3"" and the distended fog of ""Realise"", during which he hijacks deep house's stoned haze and poisons it, however slyly. That he can perform such misdeeds and still come across as elegant, musical, and inspired speaks to a talent that was never really in doubt.</p></div>"|16154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16154-shadows/|7.2|Andrew Gaerig

Do you have any idea how <i>hard</i> it is to play this stuff in a club without coming off like rank amateurs or soulless professionals? You have to be tighter-than-tight to replicate those metronomic rhythms, while also being loose enough to play through any in-the-moment human glitches. You can't wrong-foot dancers, but you also can't be so precision-tooled that you lose the sense of abandon that's essential to any good party. You're not competing with a drum machine, which is tough enough to do. You're competing with <a href=""http://www.nilerodgers.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nile Rodgers' Chic</a>, a much more forbidding proposition.</p>
<p>In the safety of a recording booth, a band like Escort is allowed to flub multiple takes, correct any mistakes, and experiment without worrying about bringing the party down from its boil. They can tinker with their lush arrangements until they fit with the jigsaw-precision that was required of disco bands in the genre's pre-computer heyday. <i>Escort</i> is the result of all that fieriness and fine-tuning, the band's debut album after a drawn-out series of singles, teasing fans for more than half a decade. On the evidence, Balis and Cho are two producers who've listened long and hard to the history of their favorite genre, and who care about getting both the little details and the overall Broadway-meets-boogie vibe just right. They manage to replicate every <i>Off the Wall</i> horn blast and Patrick Cowley synth bubble with loving music geek precision.</p>
<p>But <i>Escort</i> isn't <i>just</i> the pinnacle of 21st-century disco fetishism. (Though it would be a singular achievement even if it were.) It's a great pop album, even if it's working off 1979's pop template rather than 2011's. Balis and Cho aren't quite up to Chic's level, obviously, as songwriters or players. But they've set themselves a similar task, out to prove that refinement and abandon aren't mutually exclusive. Like disco the first time around, <i>Escort</i> aims directly for the brain's pleasure centers, particularly the one marked ""bubblefunk,"" but there's also an intensity and attention to sound design that comes from being both an in-the-moment live unit and studio rat tinkerers. All this astounding detail work is there to add extra thrills to songs that are instantly accessible, immediately charming. Rather than 12""-friendly extended disco remixes, these cuts are shaved down to the essentials. And the grooves would be strong enough with half the bells and whistles.</p>
<p>Escort just want you to have a damned good time, even if you don't know <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28975-walter-gibbons/"" target=""_blank"">Walter Gibbons</a> from KC and the Sunshine Band. And they're willing to risk all sorts of cheesiness to get you there. So it's no accident that ""A Sailboat in the Moonlight"" seamlessly switches halfway thorough, from hammy musical theater to lascivious funk. The ""mutant disco"" scene and the pre-crossover Loft underground cuts may be the pieces of the disco pie most palatable to indie-reared ears. But Escort remind revisionist critics that disco also had roots in supper-club schmaltz, showbizzy soul, and Las Vegas pomp. If there's a guiding spirit here, it's not benevolent weirdo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"" target=""_blank"">Arthur Russell</a> but master entertainer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11418-going-places-the-august-darnell-years-1976-1983/"" target=""_blank"">August Darnell</a> at his most eager to please. The rhythm track on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqRDct1IDI8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All Through the Night""</a> has the kind of crisp minimalism you find on the best DFA singles. But the rapid-fire R&amp;B sassiness of the vocal takes us straight to the roller rink on teen night. Sure, it wouldn't play at a roller rink <i>now</i>, competing with the brutalism of 2011's pop-dance producers, but Balis and Cho's hearts are in the right populist place.</p>
<p>Escort take obvious pains that this update on one of pop's most opulently orchestrated of genres can stand, sonically, alongside the classics. Those strings! Even if they had the money, modern major labels still wouldn't lavish <i>that</i> much attention on recording a string section. And if that old-school analog lushness is computer fakery, then I'm doubly impressed. But given Escort's rep for throwing down live, I doubt it. It's easy enough to press a button and unleash a sampled swirl of strings or a blast of brass. It's something else entirely to be orchestrating violinists and trumpet players through a seven-minute monster groove. That kind of commitment is one reason Escort have ascended to the top ranks of neo-disco acts, swinging their way through the demands of disco with the consummate skill of the kind of crack big bands that were everywhere in the late 1970s.</p></div>"|16165.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16165-escort/|7.7|Jess Harvell

But they don't need any of that to aspire to the standards set by the still-awesome <i>Murda Muzik</i>, their 1999 LP which, in retrospect, could be seen as a forerunner to DipSet's synthesis of deadpan, absurdist violence, and a general disregard for actual rhyming. They just need to be entertaining and not give a fuck, and I mean-- have you <i>seen</i> <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/prodigymobbdeep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prodigy's Twitter feed</a> since he got out of jail?</p>
<p>But while @PRODIGYMOBBDEEP is more than capable of reminding us <a href=""http://newsroom.mtv.com/2008/02/27/how-dare-you-question-my-trend-setting-look-at-what-i-bring-to-the-table/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">never to question his trendsetting nor what he brought to the table</a>, very little of that batshit sense of purpose or fun makes it to <i>Black Cocaine</i>. The trouble isn't that Havoc and Prodigy have run out of things to say, or that they don't really have much to rap about anymore-- they're real, you're shook, and Prodigy will almost certainly have sex with your woman if only to make your bitch ass realize your own capability for being shook. That shit obviously never goes out of style, but rather than the likely legitimate insanity Prodigy flexed on 2007's <i>Return of the Mac</i>, the two wring inspiration from that mode with the stubbornness of trying to get that last bit of toothpaste out the tube.</p>

II""</a>, the list goes on), Prodigy hardly comes up with one memorable rhyme during the entirety of <i>Black Cocaine</i>-- we get brief teases at Illuminati P conspiracy theorizing, but little anyone who's seen a one dollar bill couldn't come up with. Likewise, Havoc delivers bar after bar of near-mesmeric placeholders, but he does boast about having ""a ledger on my MacBook,"" so now you know Excel is the spreadsheet of choice for dunn accountants. Still, at least they're not fronting like club attendees or sex symbols anymore, and any remnant of G-Unit factory production is swapped out for wheelhouse Mobb with plenty of synthesized horns and ice-grilled hi-hats. But the title track and ""Conquer"" just remind me of any number of <i>Infamy</i> deep cuts whose titles escape me and whose quality doesn't inspire me to find out.</p>
<p>If nothing else, you can be happy that Alchemist is inevitably involved, and I seriously doubt anyone's still holding ""Takeover"" against them if Nas isn't. While it's a distinct pleasure to hear Queensbridge's finest reconcile their differences, it's a distinct disappointment all the same at the utter lack of spark present on ""Get It Forever"": <i>Nastradamus</i> is considered one of the least-inspired hip-hop records ever made, and even then, these guys could still come up with something as bracing and utterly badass as ""Family"". And you can also admire the stylistic window dressing as Hav and P try some kind of weird upper register flow on ""Dead Man Shoes"". But they never find their footing, while you can imagine Bounty Killa spending the pauses during his offbeat hook wondering whether Gwen Stefani still has his phone number.</p>
<p>And so <i>Black Cocaine</i> comes across as not particularly different than, say, recent records from Saigon or Uncle Murda or M.O.P., guys who <i>should </i>be able to use the cratered rap economy to their advantage and create the rawest, most uncompromising, and NY-centric hardcore hip-hop they so choose, but who ultimately sound confused as to how to navigate a land with no boundaries. (Just bearing witness to ""Hell On Earth 2k11"" featuring French Montana and Waka Flocka Flame is kinda mindblowing either way.) Truth is, Mobb Deep sound kinda unsure as to where they stand, too proud to truly change up their style and still too much of a name brand to have to.</p></div>"|16117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16117-black-cocaine-ep/|5.4|Ian Cohen

His career has stumbled in  so many directions that confusion is kind of unavoidable. He's gone from being a troubled, semi-alcoholic underground rapper, to a knit-cap, Soulquarian prince, to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a>'s older, less-cool cousin, to now, just a friendly-looking guy who occasionally appears  in Gap ads. At this point, it's anyone's guess who the ""Common"" on Common's  records might be. The confusion reached its low point on 2008's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12508-universal-mind-control/"" target=""_blank"">Universal Mind Control</a></i>, in which we were introduced the mortifying sight of strip-club Common. Now, <i>The Dreamer/The  Believer</i> finds him banging his chest, demanding to know when hip-hop got all soft and sweet, and  attempting to engage <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> in a war on wax.</p>
<p>It's a bewildering spectacle, but a painful midlife crisis can cut two  ways: In one corner, yes, we have the guy responsible for a song called  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C60CMneK-a0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Electric Wire Hustle Flower""</a> demanding machismo credentials from the  former star of <i>Degrassi: The Next Generation</i>. But in the other, we have the best,  hardest-hitting, and most consistent Common album since <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1566-be/"" target=""_blank"">Be</a></i>. In fact, <i>The Dreamer/The Believer </i>occasionally recalls the rough humanity and  humble thoughtfulness of his still-untouchable mid-90s classics <i>Resurrection</i> and <i>One Day It'll All Make  Sense</i>. It's hard to know where this guy still draws his  creative fire from, but there are points on this record where Common raps as if his gift for  slick embedded wordplay and tactile storytelling was just in a pocket he  hadn't looked in for 10 years.</p>
<p>Much of the album's fuel comes from soul-rap veteran No I.D., who handles the majority of the production. The Chicago producer has undergone a startling creative  renaissance in the last two years: Until about 2009 he seemed destined  to live out his life as local legend, the Godfather of  Chicago Rap and the Guy Who Taught Kanye West. Lately, though, he's become what DJ Premier <i>used</i> to be: the guy you hire when you want to cozy up to Unimpeachable Authenticity. Even better, his latest work hits harder and more viciously than anything he's done before. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16014-ghetto-dreams-ft-nas/"" target=""_blank"">""Ghetto Dreams""</a>, featuring a fully awake Nas, is the  gulliest track Common has rapped on since <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mnKNr2Tiq8&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Corner""</a>. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZkkFYfh8V0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Blue Sky""</a> chops  up ELO's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98P-gu_vMRc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mr. Blue Sky""</a> into a looping, affecting plea. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8efjQGCfClc&amp;ob=av2n"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Celebrate""</a> is the best G.O.O.D. Music BBQ-jam since Kanye's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejqm4dBHYRo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""See Me Now""</a>. And the  back-firing-Hooptee snare kick on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAo6s94X2sk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sweet""</a> almost lets you peek  through your fingers as Common rails against ""hoe-ass"" rappers and informs us that he is ""to hip-hop what Obama is to politics.""</p>
<p>Common raps so hard on <i>The Dreamer</i> that you can almost hear his neck veins  throb. And for every bit of overcompensation-- he actually  cracks a bottle over a dude's head in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnIwbK2smi0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Raw""</a>-- there's something vividly  rendered and honest. That kind of honesty used to be Common's  territory, but he surrendered it long ago to smarminess: by <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10483-finding-forever/"" target=""_blank"">Finding  Forever</a></i>, he only seemed capable of rapping in fortune cookies.  On ""Gold"", he paints fond memories of his early nights: ""Hats from  liquor stores, to avoid syphilis/ Frivolous spending/ Drunk nights  with storybook endings."" ""Lovin' I Lost"" is disarmingly humble and  open-hearted about heartbreak: ""I must confess, I miss the days of you  laying on my chest."" Of course, there's still nothing worse than a Latter-Day Common Simile, and goofy lyrics abound. But the reason <i>The Dreamer/The  Believer </i>sticks-- and it does-- isn't because Common reclaims some  musty real-dude credentials he never had: It's because something seems to have reminded him that he's not a persona, but a real, blood-pumping human.</p></div>"|16156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16156-common-the-dreamerthe-believer/|7.6|Jayson Greene

Their sound hasn't changed significantly in the interim: Dark, ambient drones tangle with scraps of post-punk and library music, while strains of dubstep and techno settle like pathogens in the bloodstream. If ""dark"" was the organizing principle of their last album, as Mike Powell said of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15012-tryptych/"" target=""_blank"">Tryptych</a></i>, then ""darker"" is their current M.O.-- murkier, more oppressive, and more intense.</p>
<p>Suffused in cavernous reverb and distortion, Demdike Stare's hammered pianos and grinding, stunted rhythms conjure a kind of post-apocalyptic hellscape. Samples of exotic drums and unfamiliar string instruments are pitched so low that the waveforms seem to fray about the edges. Whatever doesn't decompose is thrown into shuddering, mechanical motion; I'm left with the image of giant machines tilling toxic soil, spitting up shrapnel from battles long lost and forgotten.</p>
<p>Almost uniformly slow, sooty, and diffuse, the record can be disorienting; the more you listen, the more individual tracks blur together. Barring a few elegiac passages, there are few melodies to latch on to, and the record's structure feels almost labyrinthine. Tracks may meander through several distinct phases with little regard for a conventional narrative arc; some simply hover, digging in like a bad trip, until they break in a burst of chorus. Elements flit in and out of earshot according to inscrutable whim, and scattered lock grooves have the potential to fuck up your whole sense of time: I spent 10 minutes lost in a loop before I realized I needed to pick up the needle.</p>
<p>There are pieces of recognizable musical codes scattered throughout-- twanging strings lifted from dusty Ocora samplers, techno's steady kick drum, the uneasy rumble of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3079-nurse-with-wound/"" target=""_blank"">Nurse With Wound</a> and SPK. Ragged synthesizers strafe across the spectrum like strobe lights in a British field, ca. 1989. In its more harmonic passages, the record's trapped-in-a-submarine atmosphere sounds directly inspired by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5164-seefeel/"" target=""_blank"">Seefeel</a>'s great 1995 album <i>Succour</i>. The hand-soldered experiments of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop bubble up in squealing sine waves and erratic oscillations; those analog strokes are some of the freest sounds on the record, suggesting lines of flight up and away from a potter's field strewn with mouldering recordings of yore.</p>
<p>Two songs explicitly engage with current modes of club music: ""Mnemosyne"" follows <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8811-shackleton/"" target=""_blank"">Shackleton</a>'s experiments in fourth world dubstep, with ululations laid over square-wave bass blurts and cracking snares, while ""Ishmael's Intent"" taps into the ominous, ethno-techno vibe of William Bennett's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29847-cut-hands/"" target=""_blank"">Cut Hands</a> project.</p>
<p>There's a lot of this kind of thing around at the moment-- in addition to Cut Hands, this particular field of gloomy, ethno-infected, post-industrial techno includes Demdike Stare's label-mates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/"" target=""_blank"">Andy Stott</a>, G.H., Raime, and the rest of the Blackest Ever Black label, Ancient Methods, Ekoplekz, and the clockwork kalimba meltdowns of Harmonious Thelonious and the Durian Brothers-- and it's legitimate to ask what elevates <i>Elemental</i> above mere mannerism or fashion. (Now that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28150-tiesto/"" target=""_blank"">Tiësto</a>'s peddling triangle t-shirts, we can probably agree that the isosceles' hipster moment is over, but the current fascination with esoteric, sepulchral music and imagery shows little sign of abating.)</p>
<p>Beyond the pervasive sense of doom, which is only reinforced by titles like ""Mephisto's Lament"" and ""In the Wake of Chronos"", the whole album package feels like a tribute to limited-edition fetish products of 1980s industrial music. While a 2xCD reissue featuring an altered tracklisting is due later in the year, the album is currently out as a lavish, quadruple-gatefold, 4xLP set, with the individual discs colored four different shades of purple: chrysanthemum, violet, rose, and iris. (The first two pieces were included with the gatefold cover, now sold out; the second will be available for purchase separately. It's blatant collector bait, but it's hard to deny that it's a stunning piece of work.)</p>
<p>The music itself, though, is plenty compelling all on its own. More focused than <i>Tryptych</i>, <i>Elemental</i> hones in on its mood and conveys a genuine sense of mystery that goes way beyond mere affect. Part of it, I think, has to do with the fact that you never know quite <i>what</i> you're hearing. Is that a foghorn or a Moog? A chorus of reeds or a bees' nest? Where did those drums come from? Does it matter? The sound lingers in between the representational and the abstract, and that ambiguity-- that impurity-- only increases its expressive dimensions. At several points, Demdike Stare's album sounds uncannily like Chris Watson's recently released <i>El Tren Fantasma</i>, a sound portrait of a Mexican railway in its last month of operation. Blurring the lines between documentary, music, and noise, and between life and technology, Watson's chronicle turned the real phantasmal. Demdike Stare do the opposite, conjuring a vivid fantasy world out of audio salvage and crusty circuitry.</p></div>"|16163.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16163-elemental-parts-1-2/|7.9|Philip Sherburne

They laundry-list the records released that week in 1972, ranging from a posthumous Jimi Hendrix LP to John Fahey, Tim Buckley, Bonnie Raitt, Nazareth, Wet Willie, and Martin Mull. To which Bobby Charles comments in his gentle, stoned Cajun drawl: ""It's too bad, a lot of good ones just have to get lost. It's unexplainable, but they just do."" To which Hansen replies: ""Well... a lot of times they get picked up the second or third time around.""</p>
<p>Warm and crackling as a campfire, easeful and understated, all of it suffused with Charles' nuanced blend of humor and empathy, this 1972 eponymous album was one of the ""good ones"" that got lost. Think of this as the second or third time around for the album to finally find its people-- and there should be plenty of them. Considering that 4/5ths of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/614-the-band/"" target=""_blank"">the Band</a> served as Charles' back up group here (augmented by Dr. John and Neil Young pedal steel guitarist Ben E. Keith), this is-- simply put-- one of the most sublime Americana records ever cut.</p>
<p>Charles' story started two decades earlier, when he wrote and recorded R&amp;B standards like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bobby+charles+see+you+later+alligator&amp;oq=bobby+charles+see&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=c&amp;gs_upl=552l2682l0l4613l17l11l0l2l2l0l149l1054l2.7l9l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""See You Later, Alligator""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bobby+charles+walking+to+new+orleans&amp;oq=bobby+charles+wa&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=c&amp;gs_upl=7752l7904l0l8723l2l2l0l0l0l0l160l319l0.2l2l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Walking to New Orleans""</a>. The story goes that Chess Records signed the then-14-year-old sight unseen after he sang them ""Alligator"" over the phone. When he arrived in their Chicago offices, though, Leonard Chess flipped out: Not because Charles was underage, but because he was white. After touring through a pre-integration South, he wound up in Nashville by the late 1960s. A marijuana rap led him to head further north, where he ultimately fell in with the musical community centered around Woodstock, N.Y., recording at Dylan manager Albert Grossman's Bearsville Studios.</p>
<p>From the opening twang and snare snap of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bobby+charles+street+people&amp;oq=bobby+charles+stree&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=c&amp;gs_upl=16357l16900l0l17514l5l5l0l3l3l0l176l320l0.2l2l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Street People""</a>, it's clear Charles' songwriting acumen had grown beyond his early R&amp;B roots. Over the slinking beat, he details an itinerant life of what one would label a ""bum."" But rather than spin some tale of hard luck and woe, Charles makes drifting from town to town and panhandling for spare change sound idyllic. ""Wouldn't trade places with no one I know/ I'm happy with where I'm at,"" he drawls. A cowbell accents the punchline: ""Some people would rather work/ We need people like that.""</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there are organ-gurgling numbers about new love and community gossip, lilting ballads about watching butterflies, honking barroom numbers about growing old, and gentle, country-tinged numbers about spending all day in bed with your honey. And then there's the ode to Jesus to save him from his followers. All of it gets delivered with a sly grin and at a pace with which you might sip a beer on a back porch, cast a fishing line into a creek, or barbecue a rack of ribs: slow, unhurried, a sunny afternoon ahead of you.</p>
<p>Some 25 previously unreleased tracks augment the original 10-song album, ranging from the pleasant to revelatory. There are differently mixed singles, three songs released only on a Japanese box set, some half-baked songs, but also the sound of Charles' shuffling toward a follow-up album that he never quite got around to finishing. Or, as he put his M.O. on one chorus: ""(I'm) staying stoned and singing homemade songs."" There's the Band's telltale funk on ""Why Are People Like That?"", Dr. John's piano commingling with Garth Hudson's gospel organ swells on the elegant crest of ""You Came Along"". Fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"" target=""_blank"">Will Oldham</a>'s <i>Arise Therefore</i> will swoon for demos of Charles dueting with the Band's Rick Danko over a sputtering drum machine.</p>
<p>When this set was originally made available through <a href=""http://www.rhino.com/shop/product/bobby-charles-bobby-charles"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rhino Handmade</a> back in August (it's in stores now via distribution partner Light in the Attic), mid-album track ""He's Got All the Whiskey"" was already an album highlight. So it's uncanny hearing both it and ""Street People"" in a post-Occupy mindset. About as loud as ""Chappelle's Show""'s intro, Dixieland horns, Danko's bass, and a snare's pop skitter about as Charles gripes: ""He got all the money."" It, of course, follows that ""The Man"" also has all the ""whiskey/ power/ women,"" the biggest crime of it being that ""he won't give me none."" It's a simple protest from Bobby Charles-- good-natured at its heart-- and hopefully it won't get ignored this time around.</p></div>"|16118.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16118-bobby-charles/|8.6|Andy Beta

When I first heard the infectious, spring-loaded ""Go Away"", I naively typed ""Household Items"" into Google. What I found was, of course, not information about the record but instead some kind of timeless commentary on domestic boredom: top results included ""household items to masturbate with,"" ""household items to make a bong out of,"" and-- why not cut out the middleman-- ""household items that will get you high."" A few more precise keywords (""Brooklyn,"" ""Young Marble Giants-influenced,"" ""guitars that sound like they've been strung with rubber bands"") led me to the record on <a href=""http://household.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their Bandcamp</a>, but once I got listening I realized that Google, in its sly wisdom, might have had it right the first time. <i>Items</i> is an ode to domestic boredom, romantic dissatisfaction, and the emotional detachment that results from feeling imprisoned within routine.</p>
<p>The most immediately refreshing thing about Household is that-- in a moment when most melodic punk comes with an obligatorily caked-on layer of distortion-- <i>Items</i> sounds cleaner than a Stepford Wife's countertop. Jenna Weiss-Berman's spartan percussion, Isabel Freeman's bouncing basslines, and Talya Cooper's pristine riffs interlock with utility and precision. Like Austin duo <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/yellerfever"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yellow Fever</a> and San Francisco's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28983-grass-widow/"" target=""_blank"">Grass Widow</a>, Household specialize in minimalist, retro-tinged post-punk that's as indebted to indie pop as it is to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a>. But the wry attitude of Cooper and Weiss-Berman's vocals recall nobody so much as the patron saint of new wave sardonicism, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23499-the-waitresses/"" target=""_blank"">Waitresses</a> frontwoman Patty Donahue. Listen close and you'll swear you can <i>hear</i> their eyeballs rolling all through the minute-long sass-fest ""Never After"". ""No-o/ Don't call me/ I'll call you,"" Cooper promises. Yeah, right.</p>
<p>""I always write these 'not-angry-just-disappointed lyrics,'"" Cooper said <a href=""http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/09/household_go_away_mp3.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a recent interview</a>, and there's a fitting sense of restraint, repression, and even passive-aggressiveness that emerges from these tunes. ""Cold Hands"" paints a portrait of a love affair in shades of dull, passionless gray (""Your laundry is folded and your dinner is made/ Your window shows cars and people, they all look the same"") while the sarcastically titled ""Our Song"", laden with Cooper and Weiss-Berman's off-kilter harmonies, laments, ""This is how we spend our days/ Nothing ventured, nothing gained."" Because the record's so thematically dour, Household are at their best when they kick up the tempo. ""Go Away"" turns a song about an emotionally unavailable lover into a briefly cathartic pogo jam: Cooper and Weiss-Berman's disparate vocal melodies braid in and out before combining into a minimalist's take on the anthemic chorus. ""Defective!/ Defective!"" they shout, and it comes off like a death sentence for a relationship that sounds about as steamy as a broken microwave.</p>
<p><i>Items</i> doesn't show much range, but at a taut 18 minutes, it's over before its one note runs its course. Still, with all this talk of drudgery and weariness, you're right to ask: What keeps an album <i>about</i> boredom from being excruciatingly boring? In Household's case, it's their grasp on melody (the songs are catchy and simple without sounding too sing-songy) and their savvy terseness (another band might stretch a song like ""Never After"" past the minute mark, but it wouldn't have as much bite). The sole song to break the three-minute barrier is the finale, ""Cold Hands"", which also contains the only moment when that tightly contained passive aggression simmers to a boil. The track ends with Weiss-Berman raising her voice: As she repeats her initially mild-mannered refrain-- ""You've got the coldest hands anyway""-- it suddenly builds into a shout. It hints at a muted rage just below the surface, and makes us hope that Household's next release might find them kicking down doors.</p></div>"|16153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16153-household-items/|7.3|Lindsay Zoladz

But is he really <i>techno</i>? He made his initial fame off the back of a bunch of fabulous acid 12""s, but he's always had a darker, more experimental side, and since 2009's <i>Cool Wave</i> has been incorporating an introverted and dignified half-goth, half-baroque pop sensibility to his productions. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14447-scared/"" target=""_blank"">Scared</a></i> from 2010 was even less hospitable, all spooky atmospheres and post-punk vocals, and last year's follow-up, <i>Perfume</i>, brought back some of the techno-friendly snares and kicks but still centered around Auvinen's offbeat, sometimes off-key baritone. For the most part, it wasn't dance music. But last year also saw the release of the ""Nonneo"" 12"", one of the year's most cherished techno missives, a gently bubbling acid bath. As 2011 wrapped to a close, Auvinen released <i>another</i> album, this one completely free of charge: but which Tin Man would we get, the weirdo dance auteur of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90yYoREHY20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Constant Confusion""</a> fame or something closer to <i>Scared?</i></p>
<p>The answer is neither. Inspired by his adopted home of Vienna, <i>Vienna Blue </i>is a gentle chamber-pop record not like much else Auvinen has put to his name before. <i>Real</i> chamber stuff, with cellos and violins overshadowing most of the synthesized elements. Auvinen calls it a ""winter album,"" and the label fits: All cool hues of icy blue and white, <i>Vienna Blue</i> inhabits a chilly but cozy place that suits stereotypically romantic images of the Austrian capital draped in snow. It's not totally foreign; just as <i>Perfume</i> and <i>Scared </i>shyly hinted at techno elements and structures, the music on <i>Vienna Blue</i> shares that forward-thinking lateral movement, only this time expressed with the gentle strokes and plucks of strings, graceful rather than tracky.</p>
<p>What can make Tin Man's music a little divisive-- what makes his albums difficult where his singles can be relatively smooth sailing-- is his own voice. Like a slurred and slovenly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2643-the-magnetic-fields/"" target=""_blank"">Stephin Merritt</a>, he shares that singer's idiosyncratic sense of cultured class, but the cavernous space his vocals inhabit can be alienating and his melodies often feel makeshift or improvised. With the more tuneful accompaniment on <i>Vienna Blue</i>, however, his presence is less jarring: When his voice dips down to those dangerously low notes, it blends in with the bass instruments instead of billowing out into an uncomfortably empty echo chamber. ""Music on the Radio"" might be his best vocal track yet, in fact, with dramatic pianos and a laborious kick drum finding some happy medium between classically tinged instrumentation and techno. It's moments like this that raise <i>Vienna Blue</i> above side-project gimmickry: ""Ice Blue Eyes"" pulses faintly with a barely there beat, like it's impossible to tell what's ""real"" and what's artificial. Throw in Auvinen's groggy vocals, and you've got yourself a gorgeous lullaby of flickering, half-present sounds.</p>
<p><i>Vienna Blue </i>is split between longer, more structured vocal tracks and instrumental interludes, which range from string-led motifs (""Winterize"" is especially majestic) to near-ambient mood pieces (""Ok, Improvise""). This lazily lapping flow nicely cuts up the length of the rather slow-moving record, but can just as easily render it drifting and aimless. The real-life instruments lend it a natural quality like sonic wallpaper that subtly blooms and and swells, but <i>Vienna Blue </i>lacks even the sparse momentum of his previous albums. The pleasantly slow creep of it all is rudely interrupted by the vocal tracks, and those times when the vocals don't quite mesh with their surroundings (""Gratitude"") prove rather garish cracks in the record's otherwise uniformly glassy ice surface.</p>
<p>As a whole, <i>Vienna Blue</i> is always caught between classicist ideas of the stately and that deeply experimental techno bent, so it never quite coheres. One thing <i>Vienna Blue</i> does make clear is Auvinen's uncompromising vision of his own style, folding in all sorts of latent impulses and confident to the point of confrontational. He remains defiantly independent from scene or context: Just as unfairly limiting as it is to call this chamber pop, it's equally ignorant to call it techno. ""Rockers, ravers, you best beware. This generation don't care,"" he sang on <i>Perfume</i>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS5Qcfr2XN0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rockers Ravers""</a>, and <i>Vienna Blue</i> caps off Tin Man's most intriguing year yet, proving he <i>really</i> doesn't give a damn about genre. It might not be perfect, but ""chamber techno"" probably <i>shouldn</i>'<i>t </i>work as well as it does on the best moments here: Leave it to someone as effortlessly suave and fearless as Tin Man to try and pull it off.</p></div>"|16155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16155-vienna-blue/|6.7|Andrew Ryce

That they were great, and special, was clear to a lot of people following indie rock, but they didn't necessarily seem like the kind of group that would develop into something amounting to a ""legend."" For one thing, they were visible during the mid and late 1990s, doing exactly the same kinds of things other indie rock bands were doing. They were on Merge, putting out albums, EPs, and singles, touring the same venues as young bands like <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Modest Mouse</a> and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/1920-helium/"" target=""_blank"">Helium</a>. They weren't under-appreciated and were by no means obscure; and the fact that they were part of a ""scene"" that made for such great copy-- the <a href=""http://www.elephant6.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elephant 6 Recording Company</a>-- meant they got their share of attention in the indie music press.</p>
<p>But then they went away. Jeff Mangum, the project's creative force, stopped releasing new music and quit playing shows. Yet unlike the followers of many bands from that time who moved on, his fans didn't trickle away. Instead, in place of a working band with a growing catalog, Neutral Milk Hotel became an absent band with a growing cult. People were rediscovering this music, and the median age of the Neutral Milk Hotel obsessive has continued to hover in the early twenties. Since Mangum's return to performing, first as part of the <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/33719-jeff-mangum-surfaces-at-elephant-6-show-in-nyc/"" target=""_blank"">Elephant 6 reunion</a> in 2008 and then with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42913-jeff-mangum-adds-more-dates/"" target=""_blank"">slate of shows</a> last year, Neutral Milk Hotel started to seem like something that existed in the present tense again. Possibly serving as a sort of tribute to this moment, Mangum has released this limited vinyl-only box set, which collects almost all of the material released under the Neutral Milk Hotel name and adds 15 additional rare and unreleased tracks.</p>
<p>I've met people who adore <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5758-in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea/"" target=""_blank"">In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</a></i> and didn't know that Neutral Milk Hotel had ever released anything else, so it's tempting to view everything Mangum released with an eye to the part it played in the <i>Aeroplane</i> story. And while it's a settled matter that <i>Aereoplane</i> is the high-water mark for the band (as well as being one of the best indie rock records of the last two decades), I can tell you that at the time there were plenty of people who felt that its predecessor, 1996's <i>On Avery Island</i>, was nearly its equal. Certainly, <i>Avery</i> has a comparatively muffled sound and doesn't always seem to understand how to best showcase Mangum's gifts (his voice is often double-tracked and lower in the mix and hence less distinctive), but on a song-by-song basis it has almost as many great moments. The opening <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84f2wdl6f4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Song Against Sex""</a> is one of them, a fuzz rocker with a hypnotically catchy and repetitive melody and lyrics that hint at the awkwardness and alienation that draws people toward Mangum's work. NMH's world is a place where sex is fumbling, a reliably imperfect expression of an emotion that dreamers want to see perfected. And in ""Song Against Sex"", drugs and porn and staged representations of lust are so repellent that the narrator wants to leave the world altogether. It's the kind of sentiment that teenagers who feel assaulted by their surroundings will continue to discover, and its wide-eyed and wounded view of the world goes a long way toward explaining why they keep returning to this songwriter.</p>
<p>Despite its vague and decidedly lo-fi profile, <i>Avery</i> also has its share of experimentation, and it's well integrated into the songs themselves. The album was produced by Robert Schneider of Apples in Stereo, whose house-producer role in the E6 sphere you might compare to <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/konrad-plank-p114812/biography"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Conny Plank</a>'s in the German experimental rock underground. I believe that's Schneider's voice talking excitedly as ""Song Against Sex"" opens, encouraging Mangum and describing his performance as ""perfect,"" and Mangum has spoken repeatedly about how important his enthusiasm and belief was to the NMH project. The way Schneider and Mangum structured <i>Avery</i>, it feels like a suite, tunes bunched together with interludes and repeating motifs and details that fade away and then return a few songs later. The lurching <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYzMMErBbHk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Marching Theme""</a> may not have the memorable arrangement of the following record's instrumental <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdCILpteQk0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Fool""</a>, but the surging fuzz guitar and odd, snaking keyboard melody form a superb bridge between the acoustic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKxA3YdP8WA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Baby for Pree""</a> and the electric variation on the same gorgeous melody that follows, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksjL9nkLhkY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Where You'll Find Me Now""</a>. The simple horn and organ duet <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nct4Bs9e7eE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Avery Island/April 1st""</a> connects that to the comparatively fierce <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO-zSxWRSVI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gardenhead/Leave Me Alone""</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ooj6pEd6YM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Naomi""</a> is another key Mangum track, not least for its strangely wandering melody. The closing ""Pree-Sisters Swallowing a Donkey's Eye"", 13 minutes on CD but 10 minutes shorter on vinyl, is a throbbing drone piece that sometimes touches on noise music, putting it in league with similar experiments by NMH's sister band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3146-the-olivia-tremor-control/"" target=""_blank"">Olivia Tremor Control</a>.</p>
<p>If <i>Avery</i> could reasonably be compared to other music going on in the Elephant 6 sphere in the mid and late 1990s, <i>Aeroplane</i> is where Mangum created something with no easy reference points. Mixing Salvation Army band pomp, hushed folk, roaring power pop, and almost unbearably intense guitar and voice songs that are difficult to classify, <i>Aeroplane</i> still feels like one of a kind, 14 years and countless inspired bands later. It's never not been a part of the conversation in indie rock since it was reissued in 2005, and suffice to say that it has lost none of its power. It's always been mastered loud and with a mix that puts Mangum's voice right in your face, and the remaster here is just a hair softer and rounder but otherwise wisely does little to alter its forceful sonic character. <i>Aeroplane</i> is the sound of an artist fully in tune with his creativity putting himself out there with an almost painful sense of vulnerability, and the reverberations from that statement are still being felt after a decade and a half. I <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5758-in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea/"" target=""_blank"">wrote at length about the record</a> when it was reissued in 2005 and don't have much to add here, except that the packaging and sound of this reissue are first rate. As an addendum, the gorgeous picture disc/poster sleeve 7"" of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhhfJTgHx58"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Holland 1945""</a>, backed by a live version of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snXcZHUyR6M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Engine""</a>, first released in 1998, is nice to have in circulation.</p>
<p>Beyond the two proper albums, the box offers a mix of revelations and welcome artifacts. Early song <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVDED5JgE4w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Everything Is""</a> has been been released in various configurations over the years, as both a two-song 7"" and as <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5759-everything-is-ep/"" target=""_blank"">a proper EP</a>, and it's included here in expanded EP form as a 10"". Originally released in 1994, it finds Mangum in a much different place in terms of both songwriting and performance. This is where he felt most Elephant 6, enamored with the pop of the 1960s and doing his best to sing sweetly, in a higher and smoother register, to make his voice palatable. The title track and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J7cgJrDzIU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tuesday Moon""</a> (once identified on a comp as ""Love You on a Tuesday"") are basically solid, down-the-middle guitar pop songs recorded crudely but with a hint of the spark that would lead to so much more. ""Ruby Bulbs"", the first song Mangum ever officially released, is raw and noisy and shouty and reflects Mangum's interest in aggro punk, an influence that didn't otherwise surface on his records. All in all, the <i>Everything Is</i> EP feels gestational and enjoyable but ultimately unexceptional; had things ended here, Neutral Milk Hotel might be as well remembered as E6 compatriots the Gerbils.</p>
<p>The <i>Ferris Wheel on Fire</i> 10"" EP, on the other hand, is the real treasure of the set. Hearing Mangum in acoustic mode (there are seven demos here and a recording from an in-store), it's striking how much these recordings from 1992 to 1996 sound so much more like his later style compared to what was issued on <i>Everything Is</i>. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8fvolPEETk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Oh Sister""</a>, from 1995 perfectly captures that moment of the growing boldness of his songwriting; the strums and vocals seem very <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCxEWPLDg5c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Two Headed Boy""</a>, and it has some melodic and lyrical motifs from that song. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWNT11IqSXM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""My Dream Girl Don't Exist""</a>, possibly the most well-known unreleased Mangum song, feels like a dry run for <i>Aeroplane</i>, with strummed chords reminiscent of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4avoEbGjYu0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The King of Carrot Flowers""</a>, lyrics about a dead girl in the ground, and a closing ""now she knows she'll never be afraid"" that was later used on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-O0vHJzoFc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ghost""</a>. The studio version of ""Engine"" is quite close to the version released on the B-side of the ""Holland 1945"" single, and other songs (""A Baby for Pree/Glow Into You"", ""April 8th"") found their way to <i>On Avery Island</i>. Hearing acoustic songs and demos from the early days of Neutral Milk Hotel and marveling at how fully realized they sound, <i>Ferris Wheel on Fire </i>reminds me most of <i>Time of No Reply</i>, the posthumous collection of <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Drake</a> rarities and outtakes that evokes the sound of <i>Pink Moon</i> more than either of his two other properly released records. It's certainly a fans-only collection, but it also stands well on its own, with a unified sound and mood.</p>
<p>One 7"" included on the record serves more as an extension of <i>Ferris Wheel</i>, with versions of songs released elsewhere. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sody5nHbQk4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You've Passed""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksjL9nkLhkY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Where You'll Find Me Now""</a> both made it onto <i>Avery</i>. The first is not terribly different, it sounds like the basic arrangement and sound had been determined, but the fuzz guitar has more roar in the riff. The second is a welcome change-up: much slower, more downcast, less desperate, less naked. The other 7"" has two versions of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQSdpoI42hs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Little Birds""</a>-- one recorded at home, one with Robert Schneider-- which happens to be the one song here that was written after the release of <i>Aeroplane</i>. It's a harrowing composition that is dedicated to Matthew Shepard, who was murdered two months before the song was composed in December 1998, and its lyrics, ""Another boy in town at night he took him for his lover/ And deep in sin they held each other/ So I took a hammer and nearly beat his little brains in/ Knowing God in heaven could have, never could forgive him,"" seem to reference the incident.</p>
<p>It's clear in spending time with this set and listening to it in varying sequences that Mangum the songwriter liked to tinker. On this evidence he was not prolific, but he also didn't waste ideas. Parts of songs pop up in other tracks, variations get turned into extended sequences, songs are divided into parts. The seven-or-so-year songwriting arc represented here yielded only about two-dozen completely distinct songs, and a clutch more that are variations on some of those themes.</p>
<p>An overlooked element of Neutral Milk Hotel's enduring appeal is that Mangum stopped making new music at the precise moment that music was about to become ""an internet thing."" A year after <i>Aeroplane</i> came Napster, and pretty soon the way we hear and experience music would never be the same. But Neutral Milk Hotel remain, as if preserved in amber, in that moment when independent music was bought in stores and spread by word of mouth that came from actual mouths. A moment when people had to hold something physical in their hands to be able to experience the music, whether tape, vinyl, or CD. And it's fitting that this box set has been assembled with care and high-quality materials that seem bound to last well into the time when the next generation discovers this music. ""There are some lives you live and some you leave behind,"" Mangum sings in ""Gardenhead"", and it's such a perfect line for this guy. He left the music-making life behind for years, and now, maybe, he's inching back toward it. Even if he never gets there, whether by choice or because forces of whatever kind conspire against him, there's the music contained here, rich and beautiful enough to fill a career.</p></div>"|16160.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16160-box-set/|9.5|Mark Richardson

(It follows <i>Boss of All Bosses 1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>2.5</i>, and <i>2.8</i>.) Diehard Dipset fans might turn up a few tracks here where the light of Cam's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1791-purple-haze/"" target=""_blank"">Purple Haze</a></i>-era peak still flickers, but Vado, once New York's next great hope, appears so rarely that the collaborative billing feels a little misleading.</p>
<p><i>Boss of All Bosses 3</i> is symptomatic of the current era where only a handful of rappers can get albums in stores and on time. Rappers like Cam and Vado need to flood the market to keep their names on the blogs' front page, but they also have to hope that the inherent diminishing returns of a seemingly endless mixtape series don't permanently turn off listeners. Vado should be keeping up with guys like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"" target=""_blank"">French Montana</a> who have more or less assumed his buzz and replaced him in the food chain that decides which rappers might actually get to put out a real life album or take a little bit of radio airtime away from Young Money. Cam, on the other hand, is presumably looking to convince label execs that he's still a relevant artist worth an investment, a proposition that stands to lead, at best, to a internet rumors.</p>
<p>For listeners, a tape like this begs the question: When is enough <i>enough</i>? At this point, new Dipset just sounds like old Dipset, and old Dipset is way more kinetic. The production here recalls the blustery symphonies of their heyday, but Cam's disengaged flow, which once felt like the epitome of cockiness, no longer sounds hungry. He still cracks a few good lines and drops the occasional sideways reference, but the Cam of ""sake, Suzuki, Osaka Bay"" is far in the rearview.</p>
<p>A few tracks fare better than others: ""Keys in tha Damier"" isn't too far from the sample-driven bangers of Dipset yesteryear, and ""Talk My Nigga"" has the fiercest rapping on the tape despite both rappers jacking their cadence from Crazy Town's ""Butterfly"". But the appeal of these tracks isn't likely to resonate with non-diehards.</p>
<p>There's so much invigorating rap coming out of New York (and elsewhere) right now, but <i>Boss of All Bosses 3 </i>isn't exactly among the most inspiring. There's no harm in plucking out a few dope tracks for a playlist, but there's so much more heat, spirit, and conviction in the back catalog.

His short tenure in the Box Tops produced two million-selling hits, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQaUs5J2wdI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Letter""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=box+tops+cry+like+a+baby&amp;oq=box+tops+cr&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g1g-m1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=c&amp;gs_upl=115487l115678l0l116382l2l2l0l0l0l0l156l299l0.2l2l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cry Like a Baby""</a>, but the group's sound and direction were determined almost exclusively by producers Chips Moman and Dan Penn, who rarely diverged from the group's R&amp;B-laced rock'n'roll. They chose almost all of the Box Tops' songs, dictated how they should be sung, and relegated Chilton's own compositions to hastily recorded B-sides, denying the singer not only his creative freedom but potential royalties as well. Whether this was the heavy hand of a svengali or the harried influence of a producer-cum-babysitter is debatable, but after an aborted tour of Europe, the Box Tops fell apart.</p>
<p>Free from the demands of that hit group, Chilton holed up in Memphis' Ardent Studios with producer/founder John Fry and engineer Terry Manning to record a batch of his own songs. The sessions were casual and low-key, resulting in a full album of material that was never released. Instead, Chilton formed a new band, called <a href=""http://bigstarband.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Big Star</a>, which translated British power pop to American shores. But those 1970 sessions became lore among Big Star fans, passed around as rumors or bootlegs until 1996, when Ardent released them as <i>1970</i>. That collection has since gone out of print, and now Omnivore Records has reissued it with bonus tracks, following up last year's excellent <a href=""http://omnivorerecordings.com/artists/big-star/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">white-label edition</a> of Big Star's <i>Third</i>.</p>
<p>This music represents the midpoint between the Box Tops and Big Star almost too literally, as Chilton volleys between blues-rock rave-ups like ""All I Really Want Is Money"" and softly sung pop ballads like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liVMMBFMXj4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The EMI Song (Smile for Me)""</a>. The transitions can be jarring, especially as he switches between his low, gruff vocals and his mod-ish falsetto. It's hard to believe it's the same human being singing those songs. And yet, on some level, this collection may be one of the purest expressions of Chilton's personality-- not only his dreamy ruminations but also his coarse humor. According to the new liner notes by Bob Mehr, Chilton made fun of Moman and other producers for being out of touch with current sounds, specifically the British Invasion. This mocking spirit extends to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqbLDSNWGPA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All I Really Want Is Money""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJDsqz8XimQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Wish I Could Meet Elvis""</a>, which seem to take the piss out of the Box Tops.</p>
<p>There's a telling contradiction embedded in these half-assed numbers: Chilton obviously adores the rhythm and bluster of these songs, yet he has been conditioned to resent the style, to view R&amp;B as a hopelessly passé genre. His performances become caricatures of black blues vocals, or perhaps caricatures of white approximations of black blues vocals. It can be an uncomfortable listen, especially when he sings, ""that's all I cares about in de world,"" on ""All I Really Want Is Money"". Perhaps because we know about his troubles with the Box Tops, Chilton's perspective-- that of a white teenager whose voice had been conditioned to resemble that of a black man-- remains oddly compelling in its jumpy defiance, especially on the gloriously perverse covers of the Stones' ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" and the Archies' ""Sugar Sugar"" (which gets mashed up with James Brown's ""I Got the Feelin'"").</p>
<p>On the other hand, songs like ""If You Would Marry Me Babe"" and ""All We Ever Got From Them Was Pain"" sound like templates for some of Chilton's best-known Big Star numbers, contrasting his cynical streak with an earnestly romantic side. ""The EMI Song (Smile for Me)"" may be the sweetest and most delicate melody he ever wrote, and ""It Isn't Always That Easy"" is a ruminative acoustic demo that exposes the ravages of Chilton's short career to date. On <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XNWfexiM20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Happy Song""</a>, he tries on a nudie suit for size, and the country snare patter and steel guitar fit his vocals so perfectly it's not hard to imagine what other avenues he might have traveled in subsequent decades.</p>
<p><i>Free Again</i> doesn't simply predict his work with Big Star; in fact, these songs eerily prefigure much of his solo material, which deconstructed-- often messily or carelessly, but occasionally beautifully-- everything he once held dear. Even as a teenager, he had an inclination to undercut every expectation, even his own. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vHCno34XVY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Every Day as We Grow Closer""</a> may be a quiet song with a lovely melody and a huge impact, but he nearly ruins the effect by appending a short, tongue-in-cheek jam at the end. For many listeners, this aspect of <i>Free Again</i> may be off-putting, like hearing a comedian tell only inside jokes. This release, much like Rhino's <i>1970</i>, is certainly not intended as an introduction to Chilton's music. Instead, it's more like an endpoint for devoted fans looking to connect the dots. As such, it provides a fascinating coming-of-age story of an artist who came into his own playing styles he knew he loved and others he only thought he hated.</p></div>"|16137.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16137-free-again-the-1970-sessions/|7.8|Stephen M.

The Brooklyn band can be pretty hard to peg, but they maintain a very entertaining Twitter feed, make hip-hop beats on the side, and their debut, <i>Black Flute</i>, is being released on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a>'s <a href=""http://greedhead.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Greedhead</a> label. So, having our full attention and the weight of expectations, how do Keepaway choose to reintroduce themselves? Here's the first line on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12725-cake/"" target=""_blank"">""Cake""</a>: ""Everything/ Wa-oh-oh-oh-oh/ Tastes like lemons.""</p>
<p>Okay, so it's no surprise that these guys skew a little hackysack, but it's not so much <i>what </i>Nick Nauman says right there, but how it sticks out so blatantly. <i>Black Flute </i>executes a frankly baffling gameplan that forefronts Nauman's newly grating vocals, the timbre and content of which serve as the anchors in <i>Black Flute</i>'s thudding disappointment. They've done away with the wavy, reverb-soaked production that typified ""Yellow Wings"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14039-5-rings/"" target=""_blank"">""5 Rings""</a>, which at least superficially feels like a wise decision: After all, who <i>hasn</i>'<i>t </i>tired of that kind of thing over the past couple of years? Of course, that mindset overlooks the possibility that some acts are just better off with some sort of sonic obfuscation, and <i>Black Flute </i>wholly hitches itself to group-hug harmonies and lyrics that are intelligible but inscrutable conflations of philosophy, sex, and religion. It's occasionally welcoming, but mostly confusing in a manner akin to walking in on the culmination of a dorm-room bull session.</p>
<p>Credit to Keepaway for being a band that seems to have an investment in what they actually say, even if they do traffic in awkward carnality (so says ""Vital"": ""Every cat's gotta scratch, gotta run/ Can I make you find the milk on the tip of my tongue"") and vaguely stoned revelations as impenetrable as adobe slabs. ""Hologram"" tries to coalesce Garden of Eden imagery with sci-fi futurism, but mostly sounds like a Yeasayer demo, and even without the trippy studio effects, tracks like ""Royal Jelly"" tend to drift thanks to run-on fantasias like ""16 royal elephants/ I'm hardly running/ But I'm moving twice as fast as them/ Each one has a rider/ Dressed in royal armor."" I mean, make fun of Rusted Root all you want, but at least they yodeled what they meant.</p>
<p>There's a certain logic to it all, and some of <i>Black Flute </i>manages to lodge itself into your brain on sheer repetition, even if it doesn't always feel particularly welcome. There are hooks situated within this fruitopia of light-stepping reggae (""Cake"", ""Bomb Track""), Casio synth-pop (""Hologram""), and unmoored R&amp;B balladry (the closing ""Purple"") that aspire to the sonically dry but lyrically louche configuration of early Prince. But in light of the lush production they contributed to Das Racist (especially ""Amazing"" from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14662-sit-down-man/"" target=""_blank"">Sit Down, Man</a></i>), you question why they've grown so enamored with all these Tinker Toy drum patterns and a bass that occasionally sounds like it's not even plugged in. And so rather than stressing its lilting harmonies and sopping atmosphere, ""Vital"" doubles down on Nauman's near-falsetto, which has the shrieking edge of Avey Tare, but none of the catharsis.</p>
<p>Considering the promise Keepaway had initially shown, you want to give <i>Black Flute </i>the benefit of the doubt, digging past its surface miscues for deep-seated flaws that might not be their own fault-- is it the culmination of Animal Collective's opening the tent for Phishheads combined with the judgment-aversion fostered by the social networking presence of Brooklyn's increasingly chummy indie scene?  Or is it an LP-length extension of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg2C299Q3cA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Deep Ass Shit (You'll Get It When You're High)""</a>? Or maybe <i>Black Flute </i>just feels so suited for campus quads because it folds so quickly in the face of pragmatic scrutiny, its dime-thin arrangements and cashed-bowl musings equal parts self-denial and self-indulgence.</p></div>"|16125.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16125-black-flute/|4.7|Ian Cohen

Muggs invokes the concepts of ""uncanny valley"" and ""trompe l'oreille,"" related phrases describing the phenomenon of fabricated artifacts and intelligences mimicking ""real life"" to the point of being indistinguishable. ""The dividing line between the physical and digital worlds is fast fading away,"" Muggs writes in a prelude of praise for Anstam's <i>Dispel Dances</i>, ""in the process posing new questions about our relationship to what we’re hearing."" Most of Muggs' fascination with Anstam appropriately stems from a sense of wonder, or imagining the possibilities of a set of computers refined enough to make digital music sound as though it were recorded in a studio but play music beyond the capabilities of human hands. It's a post-milliennial update of Conlon Nancarrow's player-piano rolls, where the human becomes the controller, if not the hands-on creator.</p>
<p><i>Glimmer</i>, the new album by Polish producer <a href=""http://www.jacaszek.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michał Jacaszek</a>, takes a much different path to a very similar sort of intrigue. Jacaszek has long operated at artistic thresholds. His 2009 album, <i>Pentral</i>, for instance, seemed like an attempt to be as brutal and beautiful as possible. Without notice, he'd burst from near-silent calm into speaker-splitting tones. If that sounds off-putting, <i>Pentral</i> thankfully played more like an attempt to dismiss a binary than to bait and cruelly switch. For <i>Glimmer</i>, Jacaszek combines a real-time ensemble-- here, harpsichordist Małgosia Skotnicka, clarinetist Andrzej Wojciechowski, and himself on acoustic guitar and metallophone-- with his own web of electroacoustic effects.</p>
<p>Jacaszek possesses the soft programming touch of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"" target=""_blank"">Christian Fennesz</a>. Sensitive and slight, his electronics suggest a layer of lace sitting softly above patches of sculpted debris. As a composer with this small group, Jacaszek recalls recent romantics like Texas' excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5617-balmorhea/"" target=""_blank"">Balmorhea</a> and Sweden's delicate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4173-tape/"" target=""_blank"">Tape</a>; the music is often pretty but not cloyingly so, meaning that there's space for foreboding and worry between the oboe's lifts and the harpsichord's fanciest runs. Rather than simply process previously recorded sounds, he smartly trusses those qualities, shaping an album that feels like some science-fiction waking dream. In an atmosphere that's very pleasant but vaguely eerie, the humans and the robots interact, each occasionally slipping behind the cover of the other. Jacaszek's again craftily corroded another binary.</p>
<p><i>Glimmer</i>'s nine tracks work best as a whole, built with hard-won peaks and long-sloped valleys that disappear into the distance. As the album progresses, Jacaszek hints at previous themes and ideas, using a classical trope to earn a sense of cohesion. It works, too, making the 41 minutes between the repetition that opens ""Goldengrove"" and the granulated whirr that signals the exit of ""Windhover"" seem compulsory. But there are remix-ready instrumentals here, too, from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>-like stasis of the gorgeous ""Dare-Gale"" to the swollen majesty at the center of ""As Each Tucked String Tells"". Think of <i>Glimmer</i> as a little symphony, just with singles, and made by a musician who can't decide between the roles of producer or composer. Really, he shouldn't anytime soon.</p></div>"|16150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16150-glimmer/|7.7|Grayson Currin

But much of his work (created with assistance from longtime collaborator Nat Walker of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"" target=""_blank"">Chromatics</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27800-desire/"" target=""_blank"">Desire</a>) went unused in lieu of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/"" target=""_blank"">Cliff Martinez's score</a>. There's no point in pretending that the <i>Imaginary Film</i> of this collection's title isn't that movie. The cover depicts a steering wheel and dashboard. The intro track begins with vehicle sounds. And the lengthy 37-track score suits <i>Drive</i>'s distinctive blend of grit, glamour, and abject loneliness. Befitting its standalone release, though, this project <i>does</i> stand alone, and <i>Themes for an Imaginary Film</i> makes for an engrossing listen in a way that many film scores don't.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because we can't hear the score over <i>Drive</i> itself, but <i>Themes for an Imaginary Film </i>makes up for its lack of a visual counterpart by telling a story of its own. Evocative, stirring, yet restrained, Jewel's mixture of eerie near-silences, ominously bubbling synths, and tearjerking melodies (rendered by real-life viola and cello players) is a formidable combination.</p>
<p>For anyone expecting a quasi-album full of orchestral overtures or ambient mood pieces, <i>Themes for an Imaginary Film</i>'s opening run will set you right: ""City of Dreams"" and ""Over the Edge"" are driven by Jewel's usual assortment of grainy analog synths and brittle guitars, and there's even a slight beat underlaid, though it's more like a faint heartbeat than the disco-driven rhythms of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1728-glass-candy/"" target=""_blank"">Glass Candy</a> or Chromatics. But by the time we get to track six (""Outside Looking In""), the beats disappear and are replaced by moody, glacial waves of sound, reminding us that this is, in fact, a film soundtrack.</p>
<p>Appropriately, Jewel's sonics are adjusted for their new setting. Though he uses his trademark sounds well, the claustrophobic, sweaty-club vibe that defines Chromatics and Glass Candy is completely absent. Compositions like the fantastic ""Behind the Wheel"" are either left completely dry, with their synth elements at the fore sounding bigger and clearer (the harshly distorted ""Death Mask"" is almost wince-inducing), or awash with reverb, like the woozy ""The Maze"" or the lonely electric piano lament ""Hall of Mirrors"". The spare, disconsolate atmosphere perfectly complements the film it was meant for, but it also makes for an immersive listen, with an unusual amount of space allowed for within Jewel's music.</p>
<p>At two hours and 37 tracks long, <i>Themes for an Imaginary Film</i> is not exactly easy to digest in one sitting. But just as it bypasses many of the caveats associated with film scores, so it does with overlong albums:<i> Themes</i> works as well as mood music as it does close listening, and the way it swims between rhythm-driven beatscapes and ambient swells provides enough tension for it to unobtrusively grab your attention every once in a while. There's never too much drama, and there's never too much silence. The record is immaculately paced.</p>
<p>For you impatient listeners out there, a number of highlights are worth taking out of their original context. In addition to the aforementioned, ""Magic Gardens"" features an overwhelming synth line that sounds like the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z2DtNW79sQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Streets of Philadelphia""</a> refrain blotting out the sun, and with some fleshing out, the teasingly short ""Nightshift"" (appearing twice) could easily be a Chromatics stunner. The lack of any sort of human presence-- outside of the automated voice that begins the score and the ambulance sirens and police radio that appear chillingly halfway through-- is shattered with the album's closer ""Streets of Fire"". Performed almost entirely a cappella by Chromatics singer Ruth Radelet, the song is a stunningly naked, somber ending to the 2.5 hours that precede it. Combining plaintive lyrics with a nursery-rhyme melody, it trades the dangerous seductiveness or dirty street suavity of Jewel's other projects for pure sorrow.</p>
<p><i>Themes for an Imaginary Film </i>isn't a decadent disco soundtrack like Goblin might have made, nor a noodly synth odyssey à la John Carpenter or Vangelis. Rather, it's something completely Jewel's own, blending his distinctively fragile synthetic textures with a suitably cinematic realism that he's rarely let show. Whether you treat it as background music, incidental listening, or a two-hour magnum opus, <i>Themes for an Imaginary Film</i> is a well-rounded portrait of a key figure in the American electronic music landscape.</p></div>"|16148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16148-themes-for-an-imaginary-film/|8.1|Andrew Ryce

So it's something of a surprise that <i>Bestival 2011 </i>is their first official live record since the double-shot of 1993's <i>Paris </i>and <i>Show</i>, which capitalized on <i>Wish</i> boosting the band to its commercial zenith. The Cure have kept busier than a band of its status has needed to since then, releasing four studio records, a second greatest hits collection, and an intimidating, comprehensive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1692-join-the-dots-b-sides-and-rarities-1978-2001-the-fiction-years/"" target=""_blank"">B-sides collection</a>, while Robert Smith parlayed his godfather status into guest spots on Blink-182 <i>and </i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12025-not-in-love-remix-ft-robert-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Castles singles</a>. But these things are often as novel as their setlist, and <i>Bestival</i>'s intentions could not be clearer, accounting for the Cure's existence between 1993 and 2011 with a grand total of 10 minutes of music.</p>
<p>Then again, in a setting such as this one, fans who paid a couple days' salary for festival tickets like to have their preconceptions confirmed. Since <i>Paris</i> and <i>Show</i>, that's a one-hot-album-every-18-year average-- and I say that aware that a lot of people don't even have an abnormally generous relationship with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1691-bloodflowers/"" target=""_blank"">Bloodflowers</a></i> like I do. But even if the Cure's discography is riddled with redundancies, the question becomes: Who is <i>Bestival </i>even for? Particularly if completists almost certainly own <i>Show </i>and <i>Paris,</i> and newcomers to the band can (and often do) start with <i>Staring at the Sea</i>?</p>
<p>Without a visual accompaniment, <i>Bestival </i>is best viewed as a testament to the Cure's longevity and stylistic breadth. But while the collection speaks highly of the Cure's professionalism, it<i> </i>never catches spark, save for a performance of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+cure+the+caterpillar&amp;oq=the+cure+the+cat&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=c&amp;gs_upl=628l2274l0l4401l16l11l0l0l0l0l166l1327l2.9l11l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Caterpillar""</a>, reportedly their first since 1984.

<p>But man, if you <i>really</i> want revisionist history, get to the end of this thing. Now, especially as it comes at the tail end of a two-hour peformance, the spirited, charged-up instrumental passages of this track are inspiring. But then Smith gets to the chorus and yelps, ""I am the stranger... <i>KILLING</i><i> ANOTHER</i>."" I thought my promo copy had a typo, or it was a situation similar to when you could find copies of <i>In Utero </i>in retail stores with ""Waif Me"". <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+cure+killing+an+arab&amp;oq=the+cure+killin&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=c&amp;gs_upl=34750l35478l0l36765l6l6l0l3l3l0l177l259l1.1l2l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Killing an Arab""</a> was misinterpreted by the same people Smith lashed out against on <i>Cure</i>'s very embarrassing political rant <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+cure+us+or+them&amp;oq=the+cure+us+or+them&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g3&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=19562l20313l0l20480l10l9l0l7l7l1l152l253l0.2l2l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Us or Them""</a> as being racially insensitive post-9/11, but it's just profoundly depressing to hear the song rendered all but completely meaningless when the mass setting should make it all the more resonant.</p>
<p>Which is really the dynamic that's confusing about <i>Bestival</i>-- it's easy to enough to understand the thrill of hearing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+cure+friday+i%27m+in+love&amp;oq=the+cure+fr&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=c&amp;gs_upl=21350l21718l0l22273l2l2l0l0l0l0l194l352l0.2l2l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Friday I'm in Love""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+cure+just+like+heaven&amp;oq=the+cure+just+like+heaven&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=8381l11444l0l11636l16l14l0l10l10l0l195l556l1.3l4l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Just Like Heaven""</a> amidst tens of thousands, but at this point, the Cure feel like less of a band than a traveling museum or theme park celebrating their past with the occasional new exhibit or ride to stoke interest. In other words, a completely user-driven experience en masse: You want to remember them as minimalist, ghostly post-punkers? They're touring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11706-seventeen-seconds-faith-pornography/"" target=""_blank""><i>Seventeen Seconds</i> and <i>Faith</i></a> in the ""Don't Look Back"" format. If you prefer your mopes to be more drawn-out and reverberant, there's the <i>Trilogy</i> DVD where they play <i>Pornography</i>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14288-disintegration-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Disintegration</a></i>, and <i>Bloodflowers</i> in their exact order, exactly as they're played on record (its replay value is exactly what you'd expect). As for <i>Bestival</i>? It's what I suppose is a great reminder about the vastness of the Cure's actual catalog and their real-time vitality as a band as opposed to merely their influence, but even two hours of their best stuff in this format feels less rewarding than spending 20 minutes cobbling together your own Spotify playlist. After all, the corollary to the Cure-as-a-business is that the customer's always right.</p></div>"|16120.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16120-bestival-2011/|5.8|Ian Cohen

When asked who his favorite rap act of 2011 had been, he named Bay Area duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29865-main-attrakionz/"" target=""_blank"">Main Attrakionz</a>, whose prolific output and undaunted adoption of the burgeoning ""cloud rap"" sub-genre has earned them a growing profile and a diverse collection of fans. ""They talking street shit,"" Brown explained of Squadda B and MondreM.A.N., ""but they talking it over those trippy-ass, cloudy-ass beats."" The co-sign still felt a little surprising: On one hand, anyone who has heard <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15784-main-attrakionz-808s-dark-grapes-ii/"" target=""_blank"">808s &amp; Dark Grapes II</a>, </i>the group's most notable release to date, knows how easily pleasing their half-baked creations can be. But on the other, for a guy like Brown-- whose wildman persona is often one of his great draws on record-- putting on for two guys who are often criticized for both not having a ton of personality, and sometimes being unable to think outside of their own little box, seemed somewhat incongruent.</p>
<p>Take for instance last year's <a href=""http://greenovamusic.bandcamp.com/album/i-smoke-because-i-dont-care-about-death"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>I Smoke Because I Don't Care About Death</i></a>, the excellently titled but not totally memorable solo mixtape from Squadda B, which featured a smattering of awfully cloudy tracks that found a guy sounding so comfortable in his own lane, it seemed as if he'd never get over. Which is why <i>Back $ellin' Crack</i>, which squeaked in right before 2011's final bell rang, may provide some clues as to why we might be seeing more straightforward music coming from the Main Attrakionz camp in the new year. Just looking at that borderline-NSFW album cover above, it's clear that <i>Back $ellin' Crack</i> is not strictly another cloud-rap affair. Instead, Squadda has crafted a mixtape's mixtape, with strong, varied production styles that could complement any assortment of rappers. And while unsurprisingly lacking in content-rich lyricism, this center-of-left approach proves to be a step in the right direction, with Squadda's oddball tendencies and workmanlike demeanor still intact.</p>
<p>There is a lot of personality to be found on <i>Back $ellin' Crack</i>, but it's helpful that, working outside of his normal routine, Squadda never appears to feel the need to play keep-up or bend to the will of a beat. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1VZAYCSx0I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Down""</a>, which features barn-burning verses from MA affiliate Shady Blaze and Danny Brown himself, is probably most indicative of Squadda's focus here. Some rappers would feel hard-pressed to set off the double-time fireworks just to remain visible, but his ability to play the background and let others shine where applicable (one of the benefits of normally having to share the spotlight with another MC) is a real asset. Which isn't to say that he's using the rest of his time here most wisely: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0o7HXh4tK4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rapgame""</a>, which boasts some <i>Supreme Clientele</i>-grade silkiness, finds Squadda both reflective and funny (""Wonder if they think I'm lyin' about the shit I spit/ Can I at least get a chance to start lyin' about shit?""), while <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrX0sH4oylk&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Van Halen""</a> opens with some weirdly appealing, atonal singsong rap. But most fun of all might be <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z222egY1m64&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Greenova Way""</a>, with its Looney Tuned-up beat (courtesy of Squadda himself) allowing him to playfully jab at the pigeonholers: ""They call it cloud rap/ Wanna see me? Then look up!""</p>
<p>But not all of <i>Back $ellin' Crack</i> is nearly as effective. The second half of the tape, which heavily features MondreM.A.N., feels too safe compared to the material that preceded it. None of it really has anything to do with Mondre's presence, nor the way Squadda and he sound on these tracks together-- in fact, stuff like ""Conversations Pt. II"" makes for a solid entry in the Main Attrakionz catalog. But in context, it's a step backward, especially considering how much effort Squadda has put into taking the duo's established sound and repurposing it for audiences more drawn to conventional approaches. By the time <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czcAc8COMpc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cream Soda""</a> shows up-- which unfortunately finds Squadda rapping over Fleetwood Mac's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM7-PYtXtJM&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Landslide""</a> (what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Frank Ocean</a> hath wrought!)-- there's a distinct sense that <i>Back $ellin' Crack</i>'s ambition has dried up.</p>
<p>Stick around though, because there's still the two-part, seven-and-a-half-minute opus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnybcA9RhLA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hail Squadda""</a> to feast on. Combining the warped, crystalline lean-back synths of producer Marlee B's opening portion (complete with a creeped-out repurposing of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkJA6SYwa94"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hail Mary""</a> chorus) with Status Star's thunderous finale, Danny Brown's prediciton becomes even clearer: ""You could totally put that shit over a Lex Lugar beat and it'd be a fucking street song."" It's some seriously tough stuff, and even further proof that when the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.</p></div>"|16151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16151-squadda-b-back-ellin-crack/|7.0|Zach Kelly

Wu-Tang was the Witty and Unpredictable, Talented and Natural Gang. Thug Life became the Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everyone. But none is arguably more fitting than the <a href=""http://www.jet-life.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">J.E.T.S.</a>' motto: Just Enjoy This Shit.</p>
<p>At a time when rap's standard-bearers are often unnaturally saccharine or overbearingly Eeyorish, Spitta, Smoke DZA, Mikey Rocks, Fiend, Young Roddy, and Trademark da Skydiver are preternaturally indifferent to the perils of fame. <i>Jet World Order</i> is Alfred E. Neuman rap. What me worry? Just listen to the drawling hook of ""Exhale"": ""Never stressing over chicks or ends/ Light it up, inhale, exhale/ Blow it in the wind.""</p>
<p>No need to trip when you're chemically focused on weed, women, and the winner's circle. This album has less range than the menu at In-N-Out, but no one ever went there looking for tacos. Theoretically, such tired terrain should make a record more dull than watching Adult Swim sober. But credit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a> and company for emulating the weed they smoke: They know to make being bored seem fun.</p>
<p>A former member of the 40-man roster of No Limit and understudy at Cash Money, Curren$y has clearly absorbed the label-building strategies of his former patrons. Wisely, he's recruited a like-minded set that rarely diverges from his aesthetic, but maintains enough identity to stay alert. There's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29513-fiend/"" target=""_blank"">Fiend</a>, the No Limit soldier and Ruff Ryders refugee in the midst of a minor renaissance, who pops up on  ""Picture Perfect"" with a flow so smooth it should be permanently draped in a scarlet silk smoking jacket. DZA, the ""fat boy of the set"" brings a dilated Uptown cool, munching on crawfish, and bragging about how your girlfriend Tweets at him. Trademark and Roddy get the most green lights, and while both acquit themselves, neither is yet a threat to take pole position.</p>
<p>The compilation's purpose is self-evident: to leverage Curren$y's star and earn attention for his set. It's a role that rap crews have regularly employed since at least Marley Marl's <i>In Control, Volume 1</i>. Most of the time, it's a mixed bag, depending on the label, its roster, and how much weed was wasted that day in the lab. <i>Jet World Order</i> doesn't exactly break the mold. But what it lacks in cohesion, it covers in aimless cool. And with slow-roasted soul supplied by Monsta Beatz, Cookin' Soul, et al., the beats neatly align with the low-lidded laissez faire of the rappers.</p>
<p><i>Jet World Order</i> is the bizarro stoner twin of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15472-mmg-presents-self-made-vol-1/"" target=""_blank"">Self Made</a></i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>' Maybach Music comp from last year. Rozay, Pill, Meek Mill, and Wale are the connoisseurs who want to get high from a $500 volcano, order useless gadgets from Brookstone, and eat expensive room service off arthropod platters. The Jets twist spliffs and make their women bring them take out.</p>
<p>For all their occasional avarice, they're weirdly sensible. On ""Exhale"", Curren$y brags about still watching DVDs on the Playstation and spotting good commercial real estate deals. He manages to offer frugal relatibility and an aspiration ideal. Well-played. Rap is predicated on the idea of who would you want to get high with. And right now, the Jets' run that lane.</p>
<p>Rating an album like this feels like flipping through an issue of <i>High Times</i>, where obsessives blather in microscopic detail about the fluorescence and genetics of a new strain of sativa. Sure there's a couple of mediocre beats and a few too many boilerplate verses about getting blunted, but really, the only question that matters is whether you want to get high to this. You probably should just enjoy this shit.</p></div>"|16144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16144-jets-jet-world-order/|6.7|Jeff Weiss

The sprawling set from the shapeshifting band is bristling with basement-show energy one minute, stacking haunting Zombies-style harmonies the next. The pixelated, post-everything whoosh of their earlier, more forceful records is still very much in evidence on <i>Spills Out</i>, but it's as though their turn-on-a-dime cubism's been given the SpinArt treatment, globs of melody pooling at its edges. This unlikely meetup-- of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2461-les-savy-fav/"" target=""_blank"">Les Savy Fav</a>'s hard-driving antsiness, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3146-the-olivia-tremor-control/"" target=""_blank"">the Olivia Tremor Control</a>'s echoing psych-pop, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5789-abe-vigoda/"" target=""_blank"">Abe Vigoda</a>'s clangy hot-weather punk, and any three or four second-tier SST bands of your choosing-- sometimes smacks of eclectic overextension, but for the most part, <i>Spills Out</i> manages to revel in its own clutter.</p>
<p><i>Spills Out</i>'s first five numbers are all about propulsion, zig-zagging melodies and breathless vocals underpinned by insistent, edge-of-calamity drumbeats. This, in large part, is the art-punking Pterodactyl of old, never ones to shy away from melody, provided they can make it move. At times, the vigorous rhythms threaten to get the best of the trickily constructed tunes they're mobilizing, but at this pace, they leave precious little time to notice. The woozy lurch of ""Allergy Shots"" is quite a toneshift, its duskily triumphant melody marching its way directly into your pituitary region. Though 2010's <i>Arnold's Park</i> saw Pterodactyl playing around with psychedelia-- the acoustic flitters of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/191-sung-tongs/"" target=""_blank"">Sung Tongs</a></i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>, among other things-- here, <i>Spills Out</i> burrows its way into the rabbit hole on something of a mid-album mini-suite of thick, woozy psych.</p>
<p>Rife with spectral sound effects and blurry, tape-stressing maximalism, many of these songs could've fallen off the back end of last year's stellar <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16047-otc/"" target=""_blank"">Olivia Tremor Control reissues</a>. Like the Olivias, Pterodactyl wrest cohesion from calamity by soldiering surefootedly through all these far-flung juxtapositions, presenting these disparate styles as though they're supposed to go together. But even on the sprightlier numbers, Pterodactyl's formidable instrumental prowess sometimes blots out the songs themselves; with tempos slowed and melodies pushed to the forefront rather than rattling around the edges, they're downplaying their strengths in favor of an experiment that proves only somewhat successful.</p>
<p>When, as on ""The Break"", they match the two sides together-- its drums rollicking, its harmonies circuitous-- Pterodactyl's messy vision for <i>Spills Out</i> is given its clearest expression. For the most part, the record's final third does a nice job blending the two, squeezing little bits of baroque-bent vocalism or sci-fi sound collage in between the pummels. Their knack for jittery melody's always fared best when matched to forward motion, and though much of <i>Spills Out</i> seems to zip by in a blur, it's assembled with enough care to never quite spin out from its center. It can be more than a little dizzying, with all that stuff whizzing by, to settle on any particular chorus or guitar riff for too long. But throwing yourself in <i>Spills Out</i>'s path means letting it reconfigure your circuits, and it's hard to come out the other side not feeling pretty good about getting frazzled.</p></div>"|16149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16149-pterodactyl-spills-out/|6.6|Paul Thompson

Undoubtedly his boldest collection of tunes since the minimalistic, spacey <i>Klavierwerke</i> EP, the release features Blake at his most restlessly playful, exploring new sounds and styles while also expanding on his already varied body of work. Newcomers brought in by the full-length will undoubtedly find the tracks intriguing; for the rest of us, it's a reassurance that he still possesses his unique, inventive approach to sound.</p>
<p>Even though <i>Love What Happened Here</i> is a ""new"" release, its side-long <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12865-love-what-happened-here/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>'s been floating around the internet since the beginning of 2011, surfacing a few weeks before <i>James Blake</i> saw proper release. Like many others, I first heard it in radio rip form following its premiere on former BBC Radio 1 DJ Benji B's program. The novelty of listening to the tune was enhanced by Benji's breathless recounting of when he first heard the song during one of Blake's DJ sets. His excitement was, and is, understandable: ""Love What Happened Here"" seems to take pleasure in announcing its own presence, as zesty organ stabs unfurl the red carpet down which the track's other elements-- a sharp click-clacking beat, disparate vocal samples, warm pinging tones-- saunter with ease.</p>
<p>Revisiting the rip, I wish Benji had quieted down during my favorite part when, at the 49-second mark, James lets loose a tickly, conversational melodic run of tones that sound improvisational-- as if he's caught in a state of pure ecstasy for a second or two before slowly unfolding into the song's light, funky groove. Blake's best work has always been detail-oriented, providing the ability to take pleasure in the smallest things that are or aren't there. Like his ""second version"" of <i>The Bells Sketch</i>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42509-listen-new-music-from-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">""Give a Man a Rod""</a> that appeared on Hessle's 2011 compilation <i>116 and Rising</i>, ""Love What Happened Here"" is about those small things, stringing them together into a coherent whole that, if put in a particle generator and separated molecule by molecule, would still yield minor revelations.</p>
<p>If ""Love What Happened Here"" represents James Blake at his most purely entertaining, then the EP's two B-sides find him at his most engagingly experimental. Like many of his contemporaries in the UK bass scene, ""At Birth"" is Blake's take on house music proper-- only, this is house music done <i>his</i> way, a 4/4 beat speckled with blurry tones and strangled voices, including his own. After hearing him do the straight-and-narrow thing with his distinctive voice for the last 12 months, it's certainly a treat to find him stretching the limits of his own vocal manipulation, especially when it's used in such a haunting fashion.</p>
<p><i>Love What Happened Here</i>'s closing track, ""Curbside"", is an entirely different beast and quite possibly the most surprising piece of music we heard from him all last year. Employed in able fashion at the closing minutes of Pearson Sound's <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/pearsonsound/pearson-sound-bbc-essential"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fantastic BBC Essential Mix</a> back in November, ""Curbside"" is a seriously stoned slice of beat-tape paranoia, a locked groove trapped beneath tumbling drums, suffocated voices, and pure aural steam. Structurally, it most closely recalls the broken-weathervane hip-hop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4365-donuts/"" target=""_blank"">J Dilla's <i>Donuts</i></a> cut <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=j+dilla+the+twister+huh+what&amp;oq=j+dilla+the+twister+huh+what&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=38l4614l0l4741l35l30l4l18l21l0l223l1072l2.5.1l8l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Twister (Huh, What)""</a>, and I've heard other colleagues throw out comparisons to the Bomb Squad's confrontational production and the primordial stew of Los Angeles' Low End Theory collective. None of those comparisons are wrong, but they're not exactly right: Both as a standalone single and a piece of James Blake's catalog, ""Curbside"" is entirely, idiosyncratically unclassifiable.</p>
<p>Since its title track floated around for almost a year before its proper release, there's been speculation that <i>Love What Happened Here</i> is a clearing-house release-- that the diminishing returns found within <i>Enough Thunder</i> could very well be more representative of where he's heading as an artist. As an optimist, I'm willing to take such speculation as just that, especially since interspersed releases like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43060-listen-james-blakes-new-single/"" target=""_blank"">""Pan"" b/w ""Order""</a> single have suggested that Blake's more about following his fickle muse than adhering to some sort of pre-set career path. Either way, given his still impressively prolific nature, there's a good chance we'll know his next move sooner than later. No matter what direction he's facing, though, James Blake continues to <i>move</i> as an artist, and the thrill of witnessing those movements hasn't dulled.</p></div>"|16139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16139-love-what-happened-here-ep/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

Because <i>Bad Santa</i> would've been too obvious a title for this raunchy yet immensely likable anti-socialite? Or maybe eXquire likes a non-sequitur blowjob joke far more than the next guy and also needs to figure out a way to create timeliness for this thing, seeing as it has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Christmas. Either way, it's a fitting way for eXquire to end the year-- after all, he finished 2011 with a much bigger profile than he began it with, and if this is your first exposure to the guy's work, he got there making about as many artistic concessions as you'd expect from a guy with the word ""Muthafuckin'"" in his name.</p>
<p>It's a worthy cause for celebration. eXquire still maintains a huge chip on his shoulder and a related lack of patience for rappers ""doing their best Yeezy rendition"" and supplicating at the behest of internet tastemakers-- a line like ""Books by Marcus Garvey/ Skin swarthy/ Snuff the glitter off your Ed Hardy/ Honey BBQ strips from Hardee's and two 40s/ Bet I finish them shits before I get to my apartment"" from ""The Gold Watch"" serves as a tidy syllabus for eXquire's worldview, equally inspired by time-honored alcohol abuse, budgetary restrictions, and a general disdain for others. But <i>Merry eXmas</i> isn't stoked by the same struggle and desperation of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15864-lost-in-translation/"" target=""_blank"">Lost in Translation</a></i>, and the relatively lighthearted vibe is pretty much necessary since it asks a lot of the listener: It's essentially an outtakes collection from a mixtape, albeit one that, for all intents and purposes, felt like a label-funded debut. Nonetheless, eXquire remains remarkably sharp, taking more chances indulging in pure technical showmanship, celebrating freedom from traditional song structure in the form of 90-second trials on ""What's Beef"" (""Biggie Tribute"") and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a>'s ""Peso"" (""R.I.P. Payso"", credited to ""one of them A$AP niggaz I forgot""), while a ""backwards"" verse on ""Two 22's b/w Twenty Two 2's"", double-time flows, and fake patois all fold into eXquire's haughty, smirking, knucklehead voice that finds the missing link between G-Unit and Def Jux.</p>
<p>If these really are the leftovers from <i>Translation</i>, it explains why nothing quite leaps out at you like ""Huzzah"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12460-huzzah-remix-ft-despot-das-racist-danny-brown-and-el-p/"" target=""_blank"">its remix</a>-- it does reappear in name only as a glassy-eyed reinterpretation that does away with the hook entirely, but eXquire and company make <i>Merry eXmas</i> too much of a blast to really concern oneself with the stakes involved. ""Two 22's b/w Twenty Two 2's"" might've gotten there had it not been padded out to six-and-a-half minutes by a ""Pretty Boy Swag"" parody and audio vérité from a roundtable discussion of cunnilingus. Those things <i>do</i> have their place on mixtapes, but the decision to jam them right into the most obvious banger is an encapsulation of <i>Merry eXmas</i>' pleasures and faults.</p>
<p>There are far more of the former than the latter, though. As if you had to ask, ""Killah Tofu"" indeed samples the Beets (""Doug"" version) and spends the rest of its run time forgetting it did-- pretty much anyone who gets on a track with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a> these days holds on for dear life, but eXquire plays a worthy foil by sounding like the gulliest dude to ever quote Harvey Danger. With beats from the Legendary Mr. Len and El-P, this is still very much in the Def Jux wheelhouse, familiar enough with funk and boom-bap to know how it can be defiled for their own purposes, but also a reminder of a time when ""underground"" and ""backpack"" hip-hop didn't necessarily represent a limp, aggression-free version of it.</p>
<p>It's what often has him viewed against his will as a torchbearer for New York-centricity, but he treats it like an actual physical place rather than some sort of mythic construct of hip-hop purity-- he announces ""Stella Artois and sour cream Utz"" as pillars of his diet and by the end, he's probably namedropped 95% of his local bodega's inventory. He's certainly pliable as a voice and a personality, but the lesser experiments start piling up toward the backend-- lurching coke-rap that channels Jeezy circa 2005 (""Nightmare on Fed Street""), ""Drunken Freestyle"" pretty much living up to its name, and the high-NRG booty-bass tribute (""Power U Pt. 2"") that takes a big rip of Boris S.'s ""Don't You Wanna Pussy Ride"" and is the filthiest thing eXquire has put to tape (which is saying something).</p>
<p>Yet <i>Merry eXmas </i>can be considered a continuation of <i>Translation </i>in how ""Power U Pt. 2"" completely makes sense in relation to something like the track ""S.C.U.M."" Few artists in any genre, let alone hip-hop, are making rawer and realer breakup songs than eXquire, and ""S.C.U.M."" is his most despondent yet, never asking for sympathy or justification in his actions (""I was numb to the experience/ Jerked my head back every time she tried to give me kisses"").  Sure, on the very next track he's bragging about his ""lesbian broad who only fucks me"" and stewing over an impromptu orgy spoiled by a pal's wedding ring and a Charles Oakley Topps trading card (it makes sense in context, trust), but it doesn't contradict eXquire so much as humanize him as someone trying to reconcile the instinct to be the better man while making and being a fan of morally reprehensible hip-hop. And really, that's indicative of how eXquire's magnetism as an MC is much like Danny Brown's, even though as rappers, their styles are wholly complementary rather than similar outside of a tremendous appetite for women and drugs. You leave their music feeling that there really isn't much of a separation between what they're saying and what they're living.</p></div>"|16141.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16141-merry-exmas-suck-my-dick/|7.2|Ian Cohen

As far as the former goes: Yes, this thing exists. <a href=""http://www.guccimaneonline.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gucci Mane</a>, once one of the most prolific and popular rappers in the South, has done a full album with <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/VNastyWGM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">V-Nasty</a>, the Kreayshawn sidekick who's famous only for being a white person that has vigorously defended her usage of, and her further right to use, the n-word. As for the latter, <i>BAYTL</i> is a surprisingly competent and sometimes fun low-stakes rap album, far from the disaster it could've been.</p>
<p>Though there are many ways in which the album might have gone off the rails, it's fairly easy to pinpoint why it often succeeds. One major reason is that Gucci and V-Nasty smartly decided to let underground big shot <a href=""http://zaytovenbeats.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zaytoven</a>-- long one of Gucci's favorite and most fruitful collaborators-- handle the lion's share of the production. His beats are workshops in space and melody, stretching keyboard notes (that mimic organs) like they're taffy until the rappers have a melodic, yet unobtrusive, canvas to paint on. In Gucci's heyday the two were a constant source of gold, with Zay's production pairing harmoniously with Gucci's playful, inventive flows. On <i>BAYTL</i>, Zay is probably asked to carry too much of the load, and his effectiveness becomes dulled over the course of the album. But allowing him to produce nearly the entire record brings professionalism, cohesion, and coherence to a project that threatened to have none of the above.</p>
<p>V-Nasty, for her part, also acquits herself better than you would think. Her voice is atonal in a way that's more off-putting than interesting, and her flow can get clumsy and cluttered at times, but she's more or less up to the task of writing half of a decent album, which is more than you could say for some rappers famous for being actual rappers. She gets by well enough on swagger and brashness, and without the baggage her contributions would scan as acceptingly perfunctory. It would be hard to argue that the world needs V-Nasty's rapping-- and it doesn't, obviously-- but she'll get clowned for being a try-hard white girl when in reality there were at least four worse rappers in XXL's <a href=""http://www.xxlmag.com/2011-freshman-class/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""2011 Freshman Class.""</a></p>
<p>In a cruel and sad twist of irony, easily the best verse on the album belongs to Slim Dunkin, who shines on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH8wYd6Y6dw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Push Ups""</a>. Dunkin was murdered in Atlanta last month as he prepared for the filming of the video for that song. If there's anything truly exciting to be pulled from <i>BAYTL</i>, it's Slim's marked improvement as a writer, something that makes his premature death even sadder.</p>
<p>As for Gucci himself, he sounds sober and engaged, which is a step up from where he was for most of last year. He's on autopilot here, but he works so well with Zaytoven that the only drawback is that it allows you to dream of how good a full collaborative album between the two would've been three years ago. Gucci's major issue now-- even more than his lost affinity for cinematic imagery-- is that humor and creativity have been all but sapped from his writing, leaving us an MC whose aggressive braggadocio comes off as unnecessarily defensive. When, late on the album, Gucci raps, ""I'm not romantic, but I cook my dope candlelit,"" it's as stunning as if you ran into a good friend you thought you'd never see again. But, just as quickly, that Gucci disappears.</p>
<p><i>BAYTL</i> is a record that, contrary to the hopes of some and the fears of others, isn't a huge failure or massive embarrassment. The talent of all involved-- fading in some, and bubbling in others-- ends up taking control of the sideshow. But with that said, the album, more than anything, is a bizarre and unique artifact of rap music in 2011. It's a record that marks the time when the ""Gucci Gucci"" rapper's homegirl became notorious enough to do an album with Gucci Mane, and when Gucci Mane had fallen far enough to decide to go along with it.</p></div>"|16133.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16133-baytl/|4.9|Jordan Sargent

Over the past decade she's tried a few different nooks and crannies: After releasing her debut on her own Kiam Records in 2002 and a second album on Red Panda in 2005, she joined the ranks of Matador Records, who put out her next two LPs. She recorded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9347-over-the-mountain-across-the-valley-and-back-to-the-stars/"" target=""_blank"">the first</a> for the new label in the wake of her sister's death from brain cancer; she'd lost another sister to a car accident years before. That record was warm enough, and cool enough, to nearly obscure the heartbreak writhing just under the surface, but there was a certain darkness to the tracks, a foundational uneasiness, that lingered well into even the ostensibly cheerier <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12182-here-with-me/"" target=""_blank"">Here With Me</a></i>. O'Connor was dropped by Matador within the year of that third collection; her new record <i>I Want What You Want</i> comes on the heels of three years spent working odd jobs and piecing together a life bungled up by recording and touring (and, well, life) and finds her self-releasing through Kiam once more.</p>
<p>The new songs aren't likable so much as largely undislikeable; they seem so unconcerned with anything other than their own gentle resolution that it's hard to fault them for any shortcomings. O'Connor leads each one with her acoustic guitar and her voice, ever steady and sure, and all the other parts are there, solid and familiar-- drums, bass, all marbled with electric guitar. The songs are what they are; they are what they want to be. Each gets its own small, shimmering moment-- an uptick of inflection at the end of a line, a tiny twist of backing harmonies, a particularly satisfying tambourine shake-- which all feel so good and so right that it's tempting to misread her ongoing studies in musical economy and subtlety as lack of ambition and self-satisfaction, just to shame her into something grander.</p>
<p>The circumstances of the lyrics are mostly nonspecific relationship tangles, the stuff a singer less acutely familiar with soul-shaking personal tragedy might thrill in stewing in for 40-plus minutes. But O'Connor's songs are not vehicles of catharsis and exorcism so much as of acceptance, of moving on from events already past-- though perhaps not so far gone that a gentle reminder of how to proceed isn't warranted. ""If you make up your mind, you can change your life/ Change your life, change your life,"" she intones, and it's not the first or last time on the record she's singing to a ""you"" that might just actually be herself. (The same subject/object conflation may be read into the album's title.)</p>
<p>All the talk of change comes on one of the album's two tracks that forgo the six-string. The other renders the omission more pointed, with O'Connor's opening line-- ""You sold your guitar""-- announcing itself steps ahead of a thunked-out electric piano line, recorded so closely, so nakedly, that the slight stickiness of her fingertips against the keys is nearly audible; a wooden bench creaks as she shifts her weight. It's a story-- maybe her own, again, told back to herself--of a singer, a musician, selling an axe, taking a walk, wandering, caught between wondering what's just happened and what's coming next. O'Connor sings of ""the means and the ends/ Neither of which you can defend,"" letting her keys fall silent for a moment at the end of the phrase, leaving room for a tremulous organ to sidle in, bleat shakily, and shuffle away. The song ends soon after, not where it seems like it should but just about where it started: ""You sold your guitar/ And walked down the street/ Got on the bus/ And went home to sleep/ And never felt bad/ About being free.""</p></div>"|16129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16129-i-want-what-you-want/|7.3|Rachael Maddux

But the album's stark, slow tones are a sonic reduction compared to his work with John Olson in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29975-stare-case/"">Stare Case</a>, a project that itself trims back the noise the pair make as a part of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4619-wolf-eyes/"">Wolf Eyes</a>. Young's path hasn't been completely linear-- Wolf Eyes often sound stark, too, and <i>Regression</i> included a few noisy moments.But his sequel to <i>Regression</i>, <i>Stay Asleep</i>, might be his most minimal work ever.</p>
<p>Each of the album's five songs is built from two basic elements-- a loop of low notes and a metronomic beat. Synths and other electronics add small accents, but often the bass and rhythm march forward unadorned. With this small arsenal of sounds, Young makes music that gets tenser without actually changing much. It's tough to put a finger on how his repetitive notes can feel like a stair-climb instead of a still-life. Every track is pretty clean-- there are no hazy sonics or cloaking distortion. Yet when I listen, I'm less aware of what's happening musically than the mood the music creates.</p>
<p>That mood is almost always eerie and dark. Young's sparse approach gives <i>Stay Asleep</i> tons of negative sonic space, making it as creepy as an unlit basement. The horror-movie feel is similar to that of Prurient's last record, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15651-bermuda-drain/"">Bermuda Drain</a></i>. But where Dominick Fernow openly mimics the tropes of 1970s slasher soundtracks, Young's songs are more like analogues to onscreen suspense. In his tick-tock tones, time seems to creep unstoppably toward potential doom.</p>
<p>For Young, though, <i>Stay Asleep</i> isn't so much a countdown to danger as a guard against it, ""a hex sign... that can protect against the 'evil eye.'"" As he <a href=""http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/nate-young"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained</a> to Tiny Mix Tapes, ""I like the idea of distracting negative energy with art and holding it at bay."" Closer ""Collapse"" succeeds at that goal, with piano chords that suggest rising optimism in the face of gloom. But it's also the album's weirdest track, with Olson's horns and (ex-Wolf Eye) Aaron Dilloway's tape effects adding a warpy insanity. Ending with such a surreal tone suggests that the title <i>Stay Asleep</i> is an actual command. Maybe this isn't a horror movie but simply a dream, and the only real danger is waking up from its entrancing sounds.</p></div>"|16123.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16123-stay-asleep-regression-vol-2/|7.5|Marc Masters

But, seven years after the band's 2004 bow-out and a decade and a half on from the peak of their powers, it's the Guided by Voices of the mid-1990s from which their legend truly springs-- all those long, beery Dayton nights with little more than a four-track, a couple 30-racks, and an endless supply of inebriant inspiration. Those few years saw those five knockaround guys wrenching every good idea they'd ever had into some of indie rock's most enduring music: <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3602-propeller/"" target=""_blank"">Propeller</a></i>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3600-bee-thousand-the-directors-cut/"" target=""_blank"">Bee Thousand</a></i>, <i>Alien Lanes</i>, <i>Under the Bushes Under the Stars</i>, and countless singles, EPs and one-offs. That Guided by Voices? They're back.</p>
<p>When frontman Bob Pollard retired the Guided by Voices name in 2004, any and all cries of ""why?"" were cut with a strong undercurrent of ""what's it matter?"" At that point, roughly a dozen dudes had passed through the band's ranks, with the Fading Captain himself serving as its only constant. Pollard, in a rare display of predictability, went on to make a mess of solo records with a gang of late-era GBVers; the rock-solid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19310-boston-spaceships/"" target=""_blank"">Boston Spaceships</a>, with whom he produced his best hiatus music, found pre-breakup bassist Chris Slusarenko in the passenger seat. But when this so-called classic era band of Pollard, Tobin Sprout, Greg Demos, Mitch Mitchell, and Kevin Fennell splintered sometime around 1996, Guided by Voices changed irrevocably: Pollard's songs grew knottier, flashier, and more professional, with would-be rock star Pollard making what sometimes felt like a last-ditch effort to make music that would place him in the arenas and over the airwaves that his old band had been too rough around the edges to attract. A reunion of that late-era Guided by Voices would've been nice, but it wouldn't have meant much. And, while watching the classic band run through ""14 Cheerleader Coldfront"" to a sea of upraised fists was a thrill, it's <i>that</i> GBV-- with their scrappy, song-a-minute, attention deficient charm intact-- you'd hoped for another album from.</p>
<p>That album, <i>Let's Go Eat the Factory</i>, couldn't have come from any other Guided by Voices. Spotty, strange, all short songs and shitty sound, it's got the collagist careen of <i>Bee Thousand</i> and <i>Propeller</i> and the tumbling tunecraft of <i>Alien Lanes</i> and <i>Under the Bushes Under the Stars</i>. Recorded at the homes of Tobin Sprout, Greg Demos, and Mitch Mitchell, there's an off-the-cuff, fuck-around charm to many of its best moments that's very much in keeping with those classic-era records. The songs Pollard brings to <i>Factory</i> hew closer toward his leaner, odder, mid-90s songwriting than just about anything he's done since, and Tobin Sprout has clearly been saving some of his best material. Demos, Mitchell, and Fennell are, as ever, playing with more spirit than proficiency, which, like so much about <i>Factory</i>, is as it should be. <i>Factory</i>, with its one-and-done hooks and jumpy construction, just feels like a Guided by Voices record. For the diehards, little else could matter more.</p>
<p>Of the now five GBV LPs from this classic-era band, though, <i>Factory</i> comes up shortest in the song department. Over the years, Pollard's worked most of the lousy melodies out of his system, and though his contributions here vary wildly in tone and texture, he's gotten pretty consistent when it comes to tunefulness. Constancy proves a bit of a hobgoblin here; the more straightaway power-poppers like muscular lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44404-listen-guided-by-voices-return-with-the-unsinkable-fats-domino/"" target=""_blank"">""The Unsinkable Fats Domino""</a> zip by quickly and not unpleasantly, but they feel just a little overcooked, never quite hanging around in one's head the way some of his stranger contributions do. Throughout <i>Factory</i>, though, he seems more comfortable with his refound surroundings than genuinely inspired by them, and his contributions here, while uniformly solid, display only flashes of the one-man hit-parading of his glory days. Peppy lead single ""The Unsinkable Fats Domino"" hearkens back beautifully to the shoot-from-the-hip power-popping of old, while soused singalong ""My Europa"" and stacked-to-the-sky rockers ""Imperial Racehorsing"" and ""We Won't Apologize for the Human Race"" bring the trickiness of his later-era compositions down to the basement-level.</p>
<p>But for every sign of life, there's some shrugworthy stuff like the stormy, stuttering ""Either Nelson"" or the pretty but slight ""Chocolate Boy"" to match. And, where the classic-era GBV would stitch together bits of different songs to create a 90-second patchwork of pure pop, those seams are better concealed here, to their detriment. The farty flute kickoff to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44472-listen-another-new-guided-by-voices-track-doughnut-for-a-snowman/"" target=""_blank"">""Doughnut for a Snowman""</a> nods to those sputtering constructions of old, but it feels a bit perfunctory, a sound effect where a fleck of dumbass brilliance like <i>Alien Lanes</i>' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=guided+by+voices+hit&amp;oq=guided+by+voices+hit&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=216l2843l0l3091l20l17l0l9l9l0l219l1132l1.6.1l8l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hit""</a> might've otherwise gone. One gets the sense Bob hadn't been shoring away the best stuff like his old pal Toby, and while he's fully engaged with the proceedings in a way he sometimes hasn't been on his hiatus-era solo records, he doesn't come away from <i>Factory</i> with a single tune that can hang with the dozens of enduring toss-offs that populate the beloved mid-90s records.</p>
<p>While Bob seems to be re-acclimating himself, <i>Factory</i> finds Tobin Sprout more ready to get back into it. Much has been made of how little Pollard's voice has changed over the years, but then again, he's been practicing. Sprout-- whose sweeter-than-honey pipes and breezy songwriting proved Pollard's best-ever foil. The collection finds him sounding younger than ever, his voice cutting through the din of his six striking contributions. ""God Loves Us""-- by some distance, the set's best-- finds him flipping a Ben Franklin quote over an effortless guitar chug that proves the album's one true glass-raiser; he seems positively energized by the proceedings, turning in fat-free power-poppers and late-Lennon pin-drop balladry and, in the case of the bifurcated ""Spiderfighter"", both in the same song. Pollard, to his credit, never seems to treat <i>Factory</i> like a solo LP with a few old friends in tow, but Sprout saw an opportunity and seized it, quietly stepping out of the shadows and stealing the show. Mitchell, Demos, and Fennell's contributions amount more to vibe than dazzle here; then as now, they'd never dream of stepping out in front of the song, and while Mitchell does get some shine on the Beefhearty ""The Big Hat and Toy Show""-- his guitar snarling around a loopy Pollard vocal-- they mostly just seem happy to be there, glad to rediscover the collaborative chemistry that comes from playing with the same old guys for years.</p>
<p>A month or so back, a rumor spread that GBV had once again called it quits. The truth of the matter was actually quite a bit more promising-- they'd cancelled all upcoming tour dates, presumably to work on new recordings-- but going by the breathless reaction to the initial news on Twitter, you'd have thought it was 2004 all over again. If nothing else, all the ""what's it really matter who Pollard's playing with?"" talk finds its definitive answer in the frustratingly satisfying <i>Factory</i>, a record that, if not quite up to snuff with what came before it on a song-by-song basis, still gets along on the enduring brotherhood of its boozy creators. ""It's all taking shape in the room,"" Pollard sings on <i>Factory</i>'s penultimate song, and for a guy who's made his fair share of records through the mail, that's the kind of statement of purpose you want him to be shouting. They may never hit upon a run as good as they did 15 years back-- few bands have-- but <i>Factory</i>'s a better, weirder shot at it than anybody could've possibly expected. ""We are not the way we used to be,"" Sprout once sang. For now-- and with more on the way-- <i>Factory</i>'s close enough for comfort.</p></div>"|16131.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16131-lets-go-eat-the-factory/|6.9|Paul Thompson

They talk about some crazy shit and as a female, you're slapping a lot of other females in the face.' I'm like, 'That's what I do. I slap bitches, Dad.'"" That's Sydney Bennett <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljE83rUouUI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talking from the backseat</a> of a van during an MTV interview. Bennett, whose stage name is Syd tha Kyd, comes up often from Odd Future defenders. As the only female member of the otherwise testosterone-fueled OFWGKTA and one of the few openly gay figures in the hip-hop community, she's often cited as proof that the collective can't possibly be as hateful in practice as all that anti-gay, anti-female lyrical violence portends.</p>
<p>Syd maintains a low-profile but powerful role within the collective, producing beats and offering up her parents' home for the boys to record in. Though she stands tranquilly behind the decks during the group's live gigs, her presence is commanding-- try watching her as she menacingly nods along to the beat and slowly raises her middle finger over her head without getting chills. But as a side act dubbed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29960-the-internet/"" target=""_blank"">the Internet</a>, alongside Odd Future member Matt Martians, that take-no-prisoners, ""I slap bitches, Dad"" confidence is absent. On one hand, that's the logical result of a bona fide badass showing her soft side, dipping her toes into sounds gentler than anything else in the Odd Future catalog. But <i>Purple Naked Ladies</i> is frustratingly flat regardless of Syd and her cohort's reputations-- it comes off as a demo reel of an act that's still fiddling with what sounds right and what doesn't.</p>
<p>Think ""Odd Future R&amp;B side project"" and you're bound to imagine the velvety slink of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Ocean</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12230-novacane/"" target=""_blank"">""Novacane""</a>. But <i>Purple Naked Ladies</i> leans more heavily toward neo-soul, experimental jazz, and funk than anything else. At its brief best-- during its final three songs-- the album recalls <i>Baduizm</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"" target=""_blank"">Erykah</a>, soulful and patient and poetically narrative-driven. ""Fastlane"", for example, pairs a steady boom-bap backdrop with Syd's featherlight singing voice as she creates a four-minute metaphor out of love and car traffic.</p>
<p>The album's backend is a welcome respite from the awkward instrumental clutter that bogs down too much of the record. Too much here demands fast-forwarding, from the hollow instrumental opener ""Violent Nude Women"" to ""C*nt"", which strikes an ear-perkingly rich note for all of a few seconds before dissolving into an overcrowded mess. Lacking in songwriting muscle, many of these songs sound simultaneously thin and cluttered. As debuts go, it's primarily a failure of editing-- an EP of tightened versions of the record's best cuts would have packed a stronger first punch.</p>
<p><i>Purple Naked Ladies</i> isn't going to do much for you if you closely follow the genres it dabbles in. Like many spinoffs from the Odd Future machine, it's a small piece of a larger puzzle, useful for obsessives concerned with keeping their catalogs up to date. In that sense, it's also a reminder that Odd Future is about strength in numbers, functioning best as a gaggle of goony characters instead of individual breakout stars in the making (excepting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"" target=""_blank"">Tyler</a>, of course). That's okay for now-- those boys would be hard-pressed to fill Syd's spot if she took off on her own.</p></div>"|16145.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16145-purple-naked-ladies/|6.0|Carrie Battan

Techno <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTxxRfO06vU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">and</a></i> tech-house? Electro <i>and</i> Italo? Wasn't that, like, the second thought people had after they realized they could mix records? (Somewhere in New York, Nicky Siano is sitting in a rent-controlled apartment spinning Led Zeppelin into Bobby Womack, laughing his ass off.) This dynamic matters, as France's <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/brodinskimusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brodinski</a> is one of a wave of European artists who have come to prominence as much for their mixing skills as for their productions (see also: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/djjackmaster"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jackmaster</a>). <i>Fabriclive 60</i> is Brodinski's second commercial mix in addition to a handful of downloads, and while it's correct to say that he deploys an array of genres during his 75 minutes on the decks, it's more constructive to think of <i>FL60</i> as a collection of whinnying, vocally oriented dance tracks that Brodinski meticulously bends to his will.</p>
<p>Brodinski has a way with these tracks that forces you to forget or disregard genre distinctions. During a potent three-song stretch, he moves from house (Renaissance Man's ""Stalker Humanoid"") to UK funky (T. Williams' ""Heartbeat [Paul Woolford Remix]"") to footwork (John Roman's ""Petrified""), a game of genre-hopscotch capable of making your head spin. The result, though, isn't discombobulated or showy. ""Petrified"" isn't a DJ curveball or change of pace: It's a siren, because the mix required a siren. An old athletic scouting maxim: Don't tell me what a player can't do; tell me what he can. So it goes with Brodinski, who doesn't look at a track's particular rhythmic and tonal variances as obstacles; he uses a deft hand to tease out what they do have in common.</p>
<p><i>FL60</i> is as fun and freewheeling a mix as you'd expect from someone who recently named his label <a href=""http://bromancerecords.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bromance Records</a>. For dance music fans mostly focused on Berlin and London, <i>FL60</i> is a treat. Brodinski drags along relative unknowns and newcomers like Gesaffelstein, TWR72, and Renaissance Man. Switch and Andrea Martin's incredible, inflammatory ballad <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bucpv_22VA0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Still Love You""</a> deserves every bit of additional exposure it gets. Brodinski's own remix (as Gucci Vump) of Woodkid's ""Iron"" is a stormy, brass-stained anthem. When Brodinski isn't painting in big, bold strokes like this, he strings you along with righteous, uptempo thumpers from the likes of Instra:mental and Samuel L. Session.</p>
<p><i>Fabriclive 60</i> features no agenda save perhaps making you and Brodinski grin. It's not a genre exploration (dBridge and Instra:mental's <i>Fabriclive 50</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15229-fabriclive-56/"" target=""_blank"">Pearson Sound</a>) or an artist showcase (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12824-fabric-45/"" target=""_blank"">Omar S</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10688-fabric-36/"" target=""_blank"">Ricardo Villalobos</a>). It's not even really a ""party"" mix, though you could use it as such. Brodinski isn't as varied and creative a mixer as Jackmaster, but he has an ear for vocal melodies and a healthy lack of tunnelvision when it comes to genres. It's enough to make <i>FL60</i> one of the series' more surprising, flatly enjoyable offerings.</p></div>"|16132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16132-fabriclive-60/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

The first song on the album, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L-tqmqsAJE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Playground Hustle""</a>, could be described as ""M.I.A. and Kala Down by the Schoolyard."" <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/articles/7153-roskilde-marc-hogan/"" target=""_blank"">At Roskilde</a> that year, I saw them <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+D%C3%B8+crazy&amp;oq=the+D%C3%B8+crazy&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=16799l17527l0l17669l5l5l0l4l4l0l62l62l1l1l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a> Cee Lo Green's then-ubiquitous hit with Gnarls Barkley, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd2B6SjMh_w&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Crazy""</a>.</p>
<p>The Dø's sophomore album-- finally available worldwide after being released in some parts of Europe this past March-- keeps up the genre-hopscotching whimsicality of the debut while also urging us to approach music more innocently. The subtle difference is apparent from the best song on <i>Both Ways Open Jaws</i>, video selection <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUvUX8RkIfA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Too Insistent""</a>: Where ""At Last!"" holds back from excessively gloating about love, this song rejects our advances altogether; rather than smolder with melancholy, it perches Merilahti's elfin coo atop the kind of meticulously off-kilter, orchestral, and kids-choir uplift that makes Sufjan Stevens' ""Chicago"" or Jónsi's ""Go Do"" such hits with movie licensing dudes. The narrator compares herself to ""a tiny toe,"" and questions ""people who act like they think they have seen it all/ They're so indifferent."" She's right and she's wrong; it's often easier to dismiss someone else's personal preference by labeling them as too-cool-for-school hipsters than it is to engage with the possibility they're right.</p>
<p>More often than not, the contradictions between the band's knowing appropriations and its calls against jaded cynicism resolve themselves in the album's intricately rewarding attention to rich and unexpected sonic details. As <i>Both Ways Open Jaws</i> traipses from the Tom Waits-via-Lykke Li boho-hobo hoedown of ""Gonna Be Sick!"" to charming electro-folk waltz ""The Calendar"", it makes plenty of detours for unlikely avant-pop percussion and warped vocal effects. There's even another kiddie-M.I.A. song, the tribal chirp of ""Slippery Slope"". On lilting, piano-cracked opener ""Dust It Off"", Merilahti claims, ""Nothing has been before."" Between the elegiac folkie guitars and electronic squelches of ""The Wicked &amp; the Blind"", she adds, ""Forget your knowledge/ Forget the past/ You were somehow born today."" But it isn't that easy, is it? While this time around the Dø <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylOwLOKTTbI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">have covered</a> another ubiquitous-in-2008 pop song-- Kings of Leon's breakthrough <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF0HhrwIwp0&amp;ob=av2n"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sex on Fire""</a> in a recent BBC session-- it might be hard to hear the similarities in terms of head-slapping lowest-common-denominator commercial potential. Then again: <i>Both Ways Open Jaws</i> has teeth like a shark.</p></div>"|16128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16128-the-d-both-ways-open-jaws/|7.5|Marc Hogan

In the years since, as vocal house has made a comeback in more full-throated, traditionalist terms, Ripatti's kept Luomo shifting, his productions growing increasingly crisp and functional, gradually sweating off the liquid murk of his early releases to emerge as cold and bright tech-house.</p>
<p>While Luomo's evolved, Ripatti's other best known alias, <a href=""http://www.vladislavdelay.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vladislav Delay</a>, has remained devoted to a singular vision of ambient techno and cold digital dub. With few digressions-- such as last year's exploration of acoustic space and live instrumentation with the <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/29726-vladislav-delay-quartet/"" target=""_blank"">Vladislav Delay Quartet</a>-- Vladislav Delay's releases have progressed as a series of subtle tweaks and refinements. Ripatti's as studious and attentive a sound designer as he is a reinventer of genres, and though he saves his game-changing leaps forward for Luomo, his variations on Vladislav Delay's themes are immaculately produced and almost as engrossing.</p>
<p>If there isn't already, there should be a rule that Vladislav Delay only put out albums in the wintertime. Whether it's the influence of Ripatti's northern longitude or merely a reflection of some internal aesthetic, Vladislav Delay's records give off a distinctly frozen feel. Synths hum and hiss white noise like cold wind, drums clatter like ice or crunch like snow underfoot, rhythms break apart from themselves like ice floes. Beyond the individually chilly elements, there's the overall sense of low light and hibernatory slowness: The tracks play out like a still landscape troubled by only the occasional moving figure. If that makes <i>Vantaa</i> sound more like background than foreground, fair enough. <span> </span>Yet rather than being dull or inhospitable, it makes for a consistently habitable environment.</p>
<p>Some pieces gradually come together-- ""Narri"" coalesces into a little melody, as does ""Levite"", the latter teasing a skipping beat out of its soft swaying keys and evaporative sounds. Others, like the title track, seem to be carefully breaking apart as they unfold. ""Lauma"" might be the most unexpected track, and also the album's late climax, an initial echo turning into a rapid fan-buzzing vibration and then a pneumatic double-time drum figure not so far removed from gabber.</p>
<p><span>While any given moment of the album offers a satisfying sonic foothold, you truly get a sense of Ripatti's skill and vision over the entire course of the record: Hearing any 10 seconds, you might think the stuff static, but <i>Vantaa's</i> glacial movements carve unpredictable channels. In a way, this music is as simultaneously functional and pleasurable as Luomo's more active house tracks, only it's for an opposite function-- and a more sedate set of pleasure centers.</span></p></div>"|16126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16126-vladislav-delay-vantaa/|6.8|Eric Grandy

It was a surprisingly self-effacing line for a singer whose mystique is a central part of his appeal. And he's not wrong. By now, we know most of Tesfaye's tricks: his choir-worthy voice, his debauched lyrics, and the rich tapestry of synths and samples that backs it all up. His third full-length in nine months, <i>Echoes of Silence</i>, is more self-referential than ever, repeating lines and themes from previous records, including XO cognac (or ecstasy and oxycontin, if you prefer), questionably consensual sex, and self-destructive behavior. It was novel on his debut <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15264-house-of-balloons/"" target=""_blank"">House of Balloons</a></i>, but does it still work three albums in?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out Tesfaye isn't out of surprises: As his fans now know, opening track ""D.D."" stands for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUi_S6YWjZw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dirty Diana""</a>, and Tesfaye channels the King of Pop with an eerily accurate vocal facsimile. It's an audacious intro even for an artist whose output has already stretched lyrical and musical themes to depraved extremes. The ease with which Tesfaye can shock and awe listeners at this point feels like something of a victory lap.</p>
<p>Where <i>House of Balloons</i> was a debut tour-de-force, and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15754-thursday/"" target=""_blank"">Thursday</a></i> an arduous journey into the internal turmoil of a self-loathing narcissist, <i>Echoes of Silence</i> exudes a brazen, animalistic confidence: The production is impeccable but never showy. The songwriting is tighter and more streamlined. The slinky, spectral <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12913-montreal/"" target=""_blank"">""Montreal""</a> is the closest thing to a pure pop song Tesfaye has written since <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12131-what-you-need/"" target=""_blank"">""What You Need""</a>. And his conversational intonation emphasizes the lingering threat that underlies every lyric.</p>
<p>In lyrical terms, <i>Echoes of Silence</i> is Tesfaye's strongest work. With a clearer and less obtuse narrative arc than <i>Thursday</i>, the album finds his snaky, manipulative persona at its most blatantly corrosive. Album centerpiece ""XO / The Host"" is a stomach-turning tale of corruption and coercion, featuring one of the record's most uncomfortable moments: After Tesfaye sings of reducing some nameless girl to destitution, the beat goes quiet as he self-satisfyingly mocks, ""And if they won't let you in/ You know where to find me... 'cause all we ever do is love."" It's transparently deceptive, and it slips into <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12569-initiation/"" target=""_blank"">""Initiation""</a>, a cringe-inducingly detailed tale of drug-fueled kidnapping and gang-rape told through the part-grunted, part-rapped exhortations of an inhuman goblin.</p>
<p>With drums that stutter and slice more like Trent Reznor than Tricky, ""Initiation"" handily defines what separates the Weeknd from other R&amp;B acts, folding in the post-punk influences, the industrial touches, and that oddly alluring menace into four minutes of captivating hell. While Tesfaye's voice remains the star attration, Illangelo's production is at a high point on <i>Echoes</i>: From the decadent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=siouxsie+and+the+banshees+hong+kong+garden&amp;oq=siouxs&amp;aq=4&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=c&amp;gs_upl=736l736l0l5512l1l1l0l0l0l0l1337l1337l7-1l1l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hong Kong Garden""</a> orientalisms on ""Outside"" to the heart-rending vocal looping on ""The Host"" to the sleepy-eyed, morning-after bluntness of ""Same Old Song"", each lecherous tale is lifted by the attentive and elegant production. Those tiny strokes of detail-oriented genius pull <i>Echoes of Silence</i> from ""yet another Weeknd mixtape"" to its own lithe, cocksure plateau, the same way that the meandering production on <i>Thursday</i> emphasized the numbingly sublime feeling of loss and confusion.</p>
<p>A lot has been said of how Tesfaye has run amok with the introspective R&amp;B of artists like Drake and Trey Songz, but the particulars of self-abuse and excess haven't been profiled so intimately or persuasively by any act of comparable size or influence. Of course, all Weeknds must end: producer <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> guest produces ""The Fall"", and his mournful melodies and distorted synths climax in a locust cloud of buzzing and whirring, suddenly rendering Tesfaye's self-reassurances shaky and hollow. The album's eponymous closing track is stark naked, a hospital-bed lament so unflinchingly bright it recalls the Knife's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+knife+still+light&amp;oq=the+knife+still&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g2&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=c&amp;gs_upl=69l1508l0l2695l15l10l0l2l2l0l172l753l2.5l7l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Still Light""</a> in its mournful fatalism. Tesfaye sounds near tears, and as <i>Echoes</i> peters out with his whimpering, ""Don't you leave me all behind/ Don't you leave my little life,"" it's difficult to tell whether he's quoting a nameless victim or gasping the words himself.</p>
<p>Those four minutes of unguarded sparsity -- Tesfaye's quivering falsetto and a funereal piano-- unwind 2011's most exciting, conflicting, and self-mythologizing musical universe. On closer ""Echoes of Silence"", is Tesfaye's protagonist finally unraveling or merely beginning anew? That his loosely narrative album trilogy seems like it could begin and end at any one of its entry points seems to hint at the latter. It's a chillingly cyclical picture of decay and self-immolation marking the Weeknd's greatest triumph: an emotional thread so confusing we can love, hate, fear, and be revolted all at once.</p>
<p>Tesfaye's recycling of previous lyrics, melodies, and ideas on <i>Echoes of Silence</i> is bound to give fresh ammo to fairweather fans eager to hurl accusations of diminishing returns and unimaginative retreads at the rising Toronto star. But the repetition is akin to devices used by artists as separate as <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Terius Nash</a> and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Bejar</a>, a self-contained world of idiosyncratic artistry that the Weeknd's trilogy ambitiously embraces, rising above the catcalls of inauthenticity and ""PBR&amp;B"" lashed at it from the very beginning to somewhere else completely its own.</p>
<p>""I used to do this for the thrill,"" Tesfaye laments on penultimate <i>Echoes</i> track ""Next"", and even as his world disintegrates into the desolate closer, it's hard to think of anything more morbidly <i>thrilling</i> in 2011 than listening to the Weeknd methodically destroy himself. <i>Echoes </i>may lack the surprise-and-delight factor of <i>House of Balloons</i>, but it's a strong finish to Tesfaye's first trilogy, providing just enough closure to satisfy, and just enough mystery left to entice us back for the next round.</p></div>"|16134.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16134-echoes-of-silence/|8.1|Andrew Ryce

He grew famous  peddling an overblown, over-simplified cartoon of machismo and violence,  pumped full of dubious sociopolitical implications and adrenaline. His <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8916-lets-get-it-thug-motivation-101/"" target=""_blank"">first</a> <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9711-the-inspiration/"" target=""_blank"">three</a> <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12159-the-recession/"" target=""_blank"">albums</a> were some of the last decade's finest action  flicks. The widescreen production, from Shawty Redd, DJ Toomp, and others, furnished the exploding tanks while Jeezy  supplied the boiled-down, bumper-sticker dialogue: ""I remember nights/ I  didn't remember nights."" ""Who, me?/ I emerge from the crack smoke."" He  was Stallone in <i>Cobra</i>; he was Schwarzenegger in <i>Commando</i>.</p>
<p>But  every decade has its own action heroes. Nowadays, Jeezy is just  another down-on-his luck gangsta rapper being jerked around by his  record company. Rick Ross is the overfed rap kingpin of the moment; the  simmering feud between them has nothing to do with street credentials  and everything to do with the fact that in a rap moment mired in  varsity-lettered, middle-class nice guys, there's room for only one  Rambo. <i>Thug Motivation 103: Hustlerz Ambition</i>, which has finally wheezed  its way across the finish line, is a telling moment: It's  a solid effort, but it's also the first time that supply for the Snowman's  product has begun to outstrip demand.</p>
<p>Nothing  much is visibly wrong with <i>Thug Motivation 103</i>. In  fact, a lot of it is pretty great: ""Trapped"" opens with a verse from  boho neo-soul queen Jill Scott that induces misplaced nostalgia shivers  for classic Lauryn Hill. Jeezy sells the hoary details of the song's  poverty lament-- no cable in the house, old milk in the empty fridge--  with gut-twisting force. On ""Way Too Gone"", rising Atlanta producer  Mike WiLL Made It (Meek Millz's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml3N_GVL-mY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tupac Back""</a>, Gucci Mane's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gucci+mane+east+atlanta+6&amp;oq=gucci+mane+east+atlanta+6&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g7&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=161180l166201l0l166479l25l23l0l8l8l2l250l2703l0.10.5l15l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""East Atlanta  6""</a>) provides a head-spinning cross-breed of trap-rap and cloud rap. The Fabolous and  Jadakiss-assisted ""OJ"" provides the extravagant ignorance. All of it  is satisfyingly huge- and evil-sounding.</p>
<p>And yet <i>Thug Motivation</i> somehow feels both airless  and over-inflated, the sound of an artist trying to revisit something  gone. In the long gap between this record and 2008's <i>The Recession</i>, Jeezy has done almost nothing to tweak his formula-- a  brief guest appearance by of-the-moment ATL star <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a> aside, there's  not much here to suggest Jeezy has been keeping tabs on Southern rap's  furiously molting trends, which means even the exciting moments have a certain ""I am  big; it's the pictures that got small"" feel.</p>
<p>You  can hear the lack of organic excitement most clearly on the album's curiously flat Huge  High-Profile Hard-Sell collaboration: <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12797-i-do-ft-jay-z-and-andre-3000/"" target=""_blank"">""I Do""</a>, featuring Jay-Z and André 3000. Jay-Z hasn't appeared on a Jeezy record since <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=young+jeezy+go+crazy+remix&amp;oq=young+jeezy+go+crazy+remix&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g2&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=150l6666l0l7073l30l25l1l9l9l1l285l2335l0.5.7l12l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the remix to ""Go Crazy""</a>, and André 3000 guest verses pop up about as frequently as the  Northern Lights; the result, however, is shockingly unexciting for the pooled talents involved. For one, the song openly mimics the formula of ""International  Player's Anthem""-- ecstatic soul loop, rapturous André verse about marital love-- and baldly copying one of the best rap songs of the  last decade is just a bad idea. When it leaked, it was greeted mostly with  shrugs and yawns and disappeared into the same, sealed-off rap-buzz purgatory  that has settled around other former gangsta-rap heavyweights like 50 Cent.  Despite all indicators, and without a chart or street single, <i>Thug Motivation 103</i> sold respectably, and probably  beat his label's projections: 233,000, just behind Michael Buble's  Christmas album and Adele. The Snowman will live to wheeze another day.  But his aura of invincibility has been punctured.</p></div>"|16140.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16140-thug-motivation-103-hustlerz-ambition/|6.7|Jayson Greene

<p>The latest tease is a collaborative reissue between Southern Lord and Ideologic Organ. More than a decade after the release of Sunn O)))'s proper debut, <i>ØØ VOID</i>, Southern Lord offers it again, packaged with a bonus disc of remixes of the material by British experimental masters Nurse With Wound. That same material is available via O'Malley's new imprint as the 2xLP set <i>The Iron Soul of Nothing</i>. If those minutiae seem overwhelming, just trust this conclusion: Sunn O)))'s essential ambitions of grand presentation and aggressive collaboration were intact at the start.</p>
<p>Just after completing <i>Monoliths &amp; Dimensions</i>, O'Malley <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7678-sunn-o/"">described collaboration</a> to me in terms of the Buddhist concept of the beginner's mind, or of allowing oneself to proceed through tasks without expectations and preconceptions. ""It comes back to working on the sound itself as its own thing rather than having special guests,"" he said. It may be difficult to hear that sense of inclusion and openness on <i>ØØ VOID</i>, which from the first bass moan of ""Richard"" to the last guitar decay of ""Ra at Dusk"" sounds mostly like unwavering and unapologetic drone metal. On subsequent albums, Sunn O))) incorporated noise lords like Merzbow and John Wiese, a women's choir, Hungarian maniac and Mayhem member Attila Csihar, and an army of others. As O'Malley's quote suggests, they all played an essential role in shaping the band's sound at that moment.</p>
<p>But here Anderson, O'Malley, and longtime partner G. Stuart Dahlquist-- respectively credited as the Duke, MK Ultra Blizzard, and G:Subharmonia-- trudge through riffs in synchronous, suspended time, making up for a lack of surprises with a wealth of tone. They'd recorded their only previous release, <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7580-the-grimmrobe-demos/"" target=""_blank"">The GrimmRobe Demos</a></i>, in a small Los Angeles studio, but <i>ØØ VOID</i> was captured in Hollywood's Grandmaster, a high-fidelity location where Stevie Wonder, Neil Young, No Doubt, and Tool have all made records. Sunn O))) have always had a reputation for exacting technical standards and for pushing the limits of their force and fidelity (""Maximum Volume Yields Maximum Results,"" their credo goes), and <i>ØØ VOID</i> offers the first perfect sign of that. These recordings are monolithic, dense, and relentless, even if the compositions themselves sound much as you might expect.</p>
<p class=""p1"">There are some allusions to extracurricular influences here, like the ghastly vocals of Scream's Pete Stahl, which circle like ghosts inside the electric tide of ""NN O)))"".  A delicate pluck opens ""Rabbit's Revenge"", and long, thin tones sometimes rise to gird a riff's lumbering end. Speaking of subtle additions, the 14-minute crawl is a cover of an early version of the <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"" target=""_blank"">Melvins</a> song that some have suggested (and others have contested) became 1992's ""Hung Bunny""; listen closely past the five-minute mark, and you'll notice that Sunn O))) seem to have momentarily drafted a drummer and a screamer. It's actually a bootleg of Melvins playing the song, the sample spliced beneath the drone as both acknowledgement and texture. Years later, Sunn O)))'s evolution would come to depend on such outside sounds.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But the Nurse With Wound renderings of the material-- lifted from a transfer of the complete sessions by studio wizard Mell Dettmer in 2007-- offer a prophetically revisionist take on Sunn O)))'s eventual incorporation of mostly everything. The icy ""Dysnystaxis (A Chance Meeting With Somnus)"" punctuates a glowing stasis with short bass throbs and softer sounds that suggest Jon Hassell's recent nuevo-ambient riches playing in the next room, not unlike moments of <i>Monoliths &amp; Dimensions</i>. Both ""Ra at Dawn Part One (Rapture, at Last)"" and ""Ra at Dawn Part Two (Numbered by Her Light)"" quell Sunn O)))'s beastly roar into a sort of barely there industrial static, the signal's strength oscillating like the processes of an assembly line. The most typically Nurse With Wound pieces here, these remixes show that aggression alone isn't enough to make something sound sinister; these hums move as though they're alive, each ghastly manipulation haunting the space as if for the first time.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But these three pieces are mere curios compared to ""Ash on the Trees (The Sudden Ebb of a Diatribe)"", the real reason this set of reissues is worth the investment. Steven Stapleton and Colin Potter pull Stahl's vocals from beneath the mire, pitting his sneered apocalyptic visions against crests and collapses of mutated noise.

Egon's label has released everything from library music to Brazilian psychedelia, as well as their staple funk and soul-oriented work. Dimlite's prior album, the 2010 release <i>Prismic Tops</i>, worked off the hip-hop template he generally beds his sound in, then guzzled a rich bounty of conflicting styles, all cut together without too many joints showing. <i>Grimm Reality</i> behaves in much the same way, except fuller, faster, brighter, and with even more colors ladled into the mix. It's the best kind of grab-bag pop, where each idea is never labored over long enough for it to get old, retaining the same kind of ADD-infused freshness riddled through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25477-the-avalanches/"">the Avalanches</a>' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/385-since-i-left-you/"">Since I Left You</a></i> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"">Beastie Boys</a>' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12671-pauls-boutique/"">Paul's Boutique</a></i>.</p>
<p>Like those records, <i>Grimm Reality</i> is fired up by a constant desire to disarrange, to put everything together then gleefully throw it all up in the air and watch where the pieces land. But that impulse is mollified by a degree of control. Dimlite may take great joy in jerking his audience from Krautrock to funk to candy-coated pop tones, but he's got a way of getting from A-Z that makes it more palatable than jarring. His whimsical approach is mirrored in train-of-thought song titles like ""Blur, Blur, Blur, Blur"", ""Through the Grimms/Stars Down"", and ""One of Uh Infinity's Countless Uh Tiny Cycles"". Anyone thumbing through sleeves in a record store may mistake <i>Grimm Reality</i> for a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"">Liars</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement</a> side project after a cursory glance at the song titles, and the music often bears many allusions to rock. ""Pour Some Blood, We Got This"" even sounds like one of the pitched-down vocal experiments <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"">Beck</a> was fostering back on <i><a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Beck/Stereopathetic+Soulmanure"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stereopathetic Soulmanure</a></i>.</p>
<p>The use-once-and-destroy approach means we never get back to such terrain, but the strength of Dimlite's ideas make the constant forward thrust worthwhile. When he digs into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>-like bass repetition on ""Blur, Blur, Blur, Blur"" or the fresh-faced, new-age drift of ""Yes, Welcome"", it may feel like he's reaching down into areas he could gouge out a little more. But there's always another twist worth navigating, whether it's through the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">Beach Boys</a>-like harmonies of ""XY"" or the mutant funk of the closing ""Heroine Roof"". This is multitask composition, where it feels like Dimlite has a thousand different ideas stacked up in his sampler, all begging for attention at the same time. Sometimes his attempt to sate those voices falls flat-- the meandering post-rock feel of ""Healing a Random Tyrant"" lacks the clarity on display elsewhere-- but he's quickly back on his feet with the deliriously spasmodic funk-pop of ""Than Them"".</p>
<p><i>Grimm Reality</i> is an album that ebbs and flows, occasionally slipping into turgid cul-de-sacs (particularly on the malformed bass grind of ""Fridge Note""), but rarely failing to move relentlessly ahead of itself to make up for lost ground. When Dimlite is at his most successful, he's drawing on strands from everything around him at dizzying speed. ""One of Uh Infinity's Countless Uh Tiny Cycles"" is the best example of that, with wild psychedelic organ, motorik drum patterns, synth drones, and a great globule of distorted bass all churned together, somehow making sense in a space where none should be found at all. That track ends in a brief flurry of strings, completely incongruous to the feel of the rest of the track, but perfect as a way to shut it all down. Those kind of spaces are where Dimlite pulls all his strength, in the half-light between sense and nonsense.</p></div>"|16124.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16124-grimm-reality/|6.7|Nick Neyland

For his first proper solo release (after a handful of low-run cassettes and CD-Rs), Emeralds member <a href=""http://www.kranky.net/artists/stevehauschildt.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Hauschildt</a> took a step in the opposite direction. As he told the website <a href=""http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/features/interview-steve-hauschildt.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stool Pigeon</a>, <i>Tragedy &amp; Geometry</i> ""came from just wanting to spend time with one instrument and really exploring all the possibilities of sound you can get from that.""</p>
<p>The instrument in question is synthesizer, and the music Hauschildt makes with it is like Emeralds in miniature. He focuses on small, basic patterns that produce two kinds of songs-- slow, drifting drones and pulsing, minimalist loops. The effect can be as big and spacious as anything his group does, but Hauschildt always starts from a base of simplicity. Each track is an exercise in turning tiny sounds and gradual shifts into something large.</p>
<p>The lack of obvious variety could make <i>Tragedy &amp; Geometry</i> sound generic, but Hauschildt's devout tack actually gives the album a distinct personality. Choose any single track, and reference points quickly come to mind-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Tangerine Dream</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Reich</a>, and various half-remembered foreign film scores and PBS-doc soundtracks. But listen in sequence, and Hauschildt's consistent way with this kind of sound becomes clear, in a starry-eyed mix of small swells and planetarium-friendly wonder. At times the music can get sentimental and even sappy, but it's never heavy-handed. In Hauschildt's songs, emotion feels closer to a happy accident than an overarching intention.</p>
<p>This comes across strongest in <i>Tragedy &amp; Geometry</i>'s best cut, ""Music for a Moiré Pattern"". At 11 minutes, it's by far the album's longest piece, but it's no grand epic. Though its sparkly loops crest into some moving crescendos, its core is simple repetition and the fascinating patterns it creates. Throughout, Hauschildt deftly treads the fine line between guiding his instrument and letting its cyclical mechanisms do the work. You get the sense that he's basically happy to get out of his own way-- a common goal with anything this mantra-like-- and is as awed by the hypnotic aspects of overlapping synths as the emotional ones. Maybe that's the key to <i>Tragedy &amp; Geometry</i>'s sneaky power-- by letting his synths tell tales instead of forcing them to, Hauschildt finds stories bigger than his own.</p></div>"|16119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16119-tragedy-geometry/|7.4|Marc Masters

Instead, in true record-industry fashion, <i>Lioness</i> is a collection of odds-and-sods cobbled together over the course of nine years of recordings to create something that kinda-sorta feels like an album. Executive produced by longtime partner Salaam Remi, who helmed her 2003 debut album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10900-frank/"" target=""_blank"">Frank</a></i>, <i>Lioness</i> carries little of the subversive swagger or playful arrogance of the Mark Ronson-dominated <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10032-back-to-black/"" target=""_blank"">Back to Black</a></i>. Whether it's merely all the material that was left, or an effort to salvage her image after years of tabloid drama and self-abuse, <i>Lioness</i> presents a picture of a talented singer at her most restrained and polite. And let's be honest: Polite is the last thing we expect (or want) from Amy Winehouse.</p>
<p>That's not to say the results aren't satisfying: No matter what she's singing, it remains thrilling to hear <i>that voice</i> come to life again. On <i>Lioness</i>, for better or for worse, she takes on the role of standards singer: It feels like a hearkening back to her jazzy <i>Frank</i> days, the result of having Remi at the head of the project rather than Ronson. When it works, it <i>really</i> works: Opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44686-watch-the-video-for-amy-winehouses-cover-of-our-day-will-come/"" target=""_blank"">""Our Day Will Come""</a> is a gorgeous blend of triumph and autumnal wistfulness, a savvy intro to a record that's bound to evoke emotions just as nuanced and conflicted in its listeners. However, on tracks like ""The Girl From Ipanema"" or first single and Tony Bennett duet ""Body and Soul"", she sounds like a lounge singer, that unmistakable wit and smarmy charm only a faint glint in otherwise serviceable performances.</p>
<p>Considering that Mark Ronson-- producer of her signature tracks like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUmZp8pR1uc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rehab""</a>-- is probably more responsible for her fame than anyone else, it's surprising to see his involvement reduced to such a minuscule level. As ever, his contributions are the highlight: A new version of the Zutons' ""Valerie"" turns what was a tongue-in-cheek cover into one of her most infectious vocal performances. Meanwhile, his melodramatic rendering of Carole King's ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" toes the line between elegant and overblown, but better yet it's a shroud of pomp surrounding one of Winehouse's most delicately powerful vocals. When she breaks out into her best falsetto on the track's bridge, it's one of the few moments on<i> Lioness</i> that feels truly, heartbreakingly poignant, enough to cut through its stodgy accompaniment.</p>
<p>Winehouse's best material never came from covers or standards, however, but her personality: her bitter sarcasm, her flagrant profanity, and her dominant-but-demure air of not-giving-a-fuck. Even though half of <i>Lioness</i> is by her own pen, it's a different view of Winehouse's songwriting persona: The gorgeous ballad <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44735-hear-another-unreleased-cut-from-the-upcoming-amy-winehouse-release/"" target=""_blank"">""Half Time""</a> is endearing but lacks the sardonic bite of her other slower material like ""Wake Up Alone"" (which itself is included in an alternate Remi-produced version here), and it's easy to imagine the fake-cutesy ""Best Friends, Right?"" being more effective given an arrangement that wasn't so transparently cutesy. <i>Back to Black </i>highlight <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojdbDYahiCQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tears Dry on Their Own""</a> is present in its ""original version,"" an almost unrecognizably elegiac arrangement that on the other hand not only emphasizes the strength of Winehouse's own songwriting but its diversity as well.</p>
<p>Chalk it up to fine-tuned and image-conscious execution, but there's little on <i>Lioness: Hidden Treasures</i> that sounds throwaway, or like it should have never been released; but there's equally little that sounds absolutely essential. Released before the album, the Nas collaboration <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44512-listen-to-two-unreleased-amy-winehouse-tracks-including-a-nas-duet/"" target=""_blank"">""Like Smoke""</a> seems like an attempt at a new Winehouse jam, a pertinent reminder of her slightly more adult-contemporary-challenging ""urban"" side, the part of her that made her more than just a Grammy-adorned, technically proficient singer. Here the track sounds like a guide vocal, unsure and smothered in reverb, with Nas filling in an excess of white space rather than just guesting. On the otherwise funny, doo-wop-styled ""Between the Cheats"", her detached drawl enters full-on mumble territory, Winehouse sounding like she either can't remember or can't enunciate the words. The chorus of backing vocals feels mocking as a result, but it's a necessary moment of discomfort on a record that sometimes feels like it's desperately trying to sanitize a wild spirit after years of chaos.</p>
<p>If that all sounds a little negative, it's because <i>Lioness</i> is still weighed down with the baggage that goes along with any posthumous compilation-- but as these things go, it's a pretty strong disc. It flows well, and if Winehouse didn't sound so oddly neutered on so much of it, <i>Lioness</i> could easily be another solid entry in her catalog. As it stands, though, it sounds like the anachronistic time-travel job it is, going backward through the career of an artist who had a very distinct developmental arc. At least in one regard, Island and Salaam Remi have done the ""honorable"" thing: There's no pretense of artistic intention here, and no exploitative stabs at an artist in the most vulnerable moments of her short life. But in their mission to present Winehouse as a singer first and foremost, whiting out her personal problems and demons-- the very things that made <i>Back to Black</i> such a transcendent album in the first place-- they reduce her to her pre-<i>Black</i> standard of budding talent. Instead of adding anything concrete to her legacy, <i>Lioness</i> only reaffirms what we already knew about her, and hopefully why she deserves to be remembered as an artist rather than a media circus.</p></div>"|16112.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16112-lioness-hidden-treasures/|6.3|Andrew Ryce

They were enormously influential on certain kinds of forward-thinking rock artists (their fingerprints are all over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"" target=""_blank"">the Flaming Lips</a>, not to mention more more recent underground acts like Woods and Implodes); their records have never been out of print for long. But they've got a big, disorderly discography, and they don't really have any signature songs (the Can tracks that pass for pop-- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1WOKKEH4cw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Spoon""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7Ua3W9GkM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Want More""</a>, and not many others-- are alarmingly unlike the rest of their work). They're also tougher to ""get"" than a lot of their contemporaries: They specialized in long, jam-heavy rock grooves, and they had (two different) aggressively difficult vocalists, as well as a guitarist (the late Michael Karoli) who liked to noodle way up in the treble range. So where do you start?</p>
<p>You couldn't do much better than beginning with 1971's <i>Tago Mago</i>, freshly reissued in a ""40th Anniversary Edition"" (whose main difference from previous editions is the addition of a live disc from the following year). It's a colossus of an album, the product of a band that was thinking huge, pushing itself to its limits, and devoted to breaking open its own understanding of what rock music could be. The core of Can was four German musicians from wildly different backgrounds-- when they initially came together in 1968, two of them had studied with composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9074-karlheinz-stockhausen/"" target=""_blank"">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>, one had played jazz, and one was a teenage guitar whiz. They recorded soundtrack music and a few straightforward rock songs early on, but what they were really interested in doing was going beyond kinds of music for which they had language.</p>
<p>For some musicians of that time, that meant replacing (or augmenting) composition with improvisation: letting the unconscious mind take over in the instant, and recording the results. Can's insight was that jamming <i>alone</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> wasn't going to do the trick. One of their solutions to that problem was that, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"" target=""_blank"">Miles Davis</a>' electric group at the time, they were not a jam band but a jam-and-edit band. Their working method involved collectively improvising on little riffs and grooves at enormous length, but that's not quite what you hear on <i>Tago Mago</i>. Bassist Holger Czukay chopped up, layered and extensively reorganized pieces of their recordings (including recordings they made when they didn't think the tape was rolling), imposing afterthought on instinct to create something as densely packed as composition but distinctly different.</span></p>
<p>Their other solution was smashing the crutch of language. After Can's original singer Malcolm Mooney had left the band in 1970, they'd encountered a Japanese street artist named Damo Suzuki ""singing or 'praying' in the streets of Munich"" (as Czukay put it) and immediately installed him as their new frontman. Suzuki is ostensibly vocalizing in English-- the lingua franca of rock-- but English that's either seriously mangled or almost totally faked.</p>
<p><i>Tago Mago</i> is seven songs in 73 minutes; the first half is big-beat floor-fillers, the second half yanks the floor away. For those first four songs, drummer Jaki Liebezeit is the star of the band, setting up rhythmic patterns of his own devising (isolate his part of almost any Can song, and you'd immediately know what you were listening to) and repeating them like mantras. His drumming is actually the lead instrument on ""Mushroom"", which could very easily pass for a post-punk classic from 10 years later; everything else just adds a little tone color. (The song might be about a psychedelic mushroom, or a mushroom cloud, or maybe just the kind that comes in a can.) And his deliberate, crisply articulated marching-band-of-the-unconscious beat is the spine of the overwhelming <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dZbAFmnRVA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Halleluwah""</a>, possibly the only 18-minute song that would be too short at twice its length.</p>
<p>Then the trip turns sour and trembly. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vayV9M7ctU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Aumgn""</a> is almost as long as ""Halleluwah"" but clammy, deliberately disjointed, and nearly rhythmless; its central sound is keyboardist Irmin Schmidt's repeatedly intoning elongated, mangled variations on the meditative ""om."" Both ""Aumgn"" and its follow-up <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OtjIf9Irjo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Peking O""</a> mess with their listeners' perception of time-- everything in them happens much more quickly or slowly than it's supposed to, and as soon as any pattern of sound has stuck around long enough to grab onto, it shudders and evaporates. By the time the dreamy, softly throbbing one-chord piece <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac2KkpF1n3Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bring Me Coffee or Tea""</a> arrives to conclude the album, it's almost hard to trust it not to be a mirage.</p>
<p>The bonus for the new edition (aside from a reproduction of the original sleeve, with four variations on a semi-abstract image concerning the mouth and the mind) is a three-song 1972 live recording: something identified as ""Mushroom"" that shares nothing but a couple of lines with the <i>Tago Mago</i> version, a ""Halleluwah"" that fades out after nine minutes without generating the studio recording's heat, and a half-hour workout on the band's three-minute German hit ""Spoon"". It's okay-- they were a solid jam band, and Liebezeit could pull off those remarkable rhythms on stage, too-- but it's mostly interesting for its perspective on how much less a band Can might have been without Czukay's keen razor blade slashing away their excesses and preserving their flashes of revelation.</p></div>"|16075.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16075-tago-mago-40th-anniversary-edition/|10.0|Douglas Wolk

He makes synthesizers feel like natural elements, mingled with running waters, murmuring voices, and sighing winds. Jaar called his breakthrough record <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15122-space-is-only-noise/"">Space Is Only Noise</a></i>, expanded on a key track to ""Space Is Only Noise if You Can See"". Titles are often red herrings, but this is the rare case where we might pause and come to understand something essential about Jaar's perspective. No one has found a good box for him yet, likely because he doesn't make a <i>kind </i>of music, but a <i>way </i>of music. (In purely diagnostic terms, our own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12705-dont-break-my-love/"">Mike Powell's ""downtempo minimalism""</a> is the best shorthand I've read, though it wisely doesn't even venture to address the music's sense.) Jaar's <a href=""http://yourstru.ly/2011/11/20/stream-nicolas-jaar-darkside-ep/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">new EP as Darkside</a>, a collaboration with guitarist and bassist <a href=""http://harringtone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dave Harrington</a>, clarifies things further, but we've got to unpack a little before we come to it.</p>
<p>Listen again: Space is only noise if you can see. The nouns and verbs are flashier, but the devil's in the adverbs and conjunctions. I kind of hate that rogue ""only,"" that innocent-faced little ""if."" Does it mean that if you can see, you discover space is merely noise? Or that space becomes noise only upon being seen? And what the hell would either of <i>those </i>things mean? Jaar doesn't make it that easy for us. His assertive yet ambiguous phrasing has no solvable outcome, so it sticks in your mind-- or rather, your mind sticks up against it. And this may be the key to how Jaar's music works too. He applies a chilly, commanding logic to disassociated quantities until they fall into a restive equilibrium. He creates biospheres and then adds one extra, destabilizing element, or leaves out something crucial. His songs pose enigmatic questions disguised as bold assertions. Meaning leaks out of the substance to pool in the cracks, and things that shouldn't relate, do.</p>
<p>That Jaar is more about means than ends explains why he's able to transition so seamlessly from dreamy electronic music inflected with impressionist piano, gently digitized French singing, lobby-jazz, and cave sounds to the terse, rugged dub-funk of Darkside, all while still sounding totally Jaar: nocturnal, cerebral, sensuous, paradoxical, and intuitive. (And sounding totally Jaar is a remarkable thing for a young producer with one major album under his belt to be able to do in any case.) The tight, three-song EP, released on Jaar's own <a href=""http://clownandsunset.spinshop.com/Home/details/111962"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clown and Sunset label</a>, is at once sexy and frigid, cavernous and cramped. Much closer to idiomatic pop than <i>Space</i>, with Harrington's falsetto clenching Jaar's own loose, Matthew Dear-like croak, the EP brings Jaar's highly personalized values to the quality of time, rather than space: because what is funk, if not the creative, slantwise division of metrical time? As Harrington holds down long, deep, calmly needling grooves, Jaar colors the atmosphere around them to give them different senses of brave momentum or back-winding reticence, earthbound heft or atmospheric suspension. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12788-a1/"">""A1""</a>, he sets glimmering whorls below the loping guitar and a cushion of static above, holding them in check until the very end, when they burst forth in a high-desert mirage that carries over into the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"" target=""_blank"">Morricone</a>-tipping ""A2"". It's icy-hot stuff. The importance of Harrington's ace fretwork can't be overstated, but the frosty austerity could only be a product of the curious mind of Jaar.</p></div>"|16116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16116-darkside-ep/|8.0|Brian Howe

Their demented 2009 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13280-the-strange-boys-and-girls-club/"" target=""_blank"">The Strange Boys and Girls Club</a></i>, combined punk and country and even doo-wop into a bold and bird-flipping sound that proved fast wasn't the only way to convey agitated. On last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14005-be-brave/"" target=""_blank"">Be Brave</a></i>, they tidied up their sound and refined their songwriting, but lost so much of what made them strange in the first place. And now <i>Live Music</i> takes them further in that direction, adding piano to their guitar-drums-bass-and-sometimes-harmonica lineup. The problem with this trajectory: Every album so far sounds like a transition, pointing to big things but never quite producing them.</p>
<p>The title of the Strange Boys' new album is surely intended to be ironic: <i>Live Music </i>attempts to separate the instruments and create some depth in the production, but it may be the least live they've sounded. Gone is the lo-fi spontaneity and fuck-it-all atmosphere; instead, we get a newfound professionalism that translates to midtempo plods and something like self-reflection. The album is restrained, surprisingly low-key, and-- at its lowest points-- polite. The songs ask for but never demand your attention, then respond with a sociable thank you and good day.</p>
<p>Even so, the Strange Boys' garage remains enormous, with plenty of room to stack boxes of honky-tonk, rockabilly, R&amp;B, and classic rock. That inclusive approach has always been their greatest asset and most distinguishing trait, although for the most part <i>Live Music</i> compacts these competing urges into a very generalized Americana that never takes advantage of their Texas roots. They're not synthesizing disparate styles in the great tradition of Austin, but skimming the surfaces of ideas they once explored more deeply. In this setting, Ryan Sambol's voice, which has been compared to Dylan and any number of <i>Nuggets </i>frontmen, sounds more like Tom Petty, but without the classic rocker's signature deadpan.</p>
<p>When the tempos pick up, so does the album. ""Omnia Boa"" adapts a train-song chug-a-lug for a subtly menacing groove, and ""Punk's Pajamas"" is a jumble of guitars laced together with a gangly harmonica theme. ""You can study the past or dig the future,"" Sambol sings on the latter, ""but the present will never leave you."" It's a sharp insight that hints at the Strange Boys' goals: to incorporate rock history into a sound that isn't defined by nostalgia or innovation for the sake of innovation. They're trying to find a way to live in the moment, which is certainly commendable.

Or as OF member Mike G rhapsodizes on his new EP <a href=""http://oddfuture.tumblr.com/post/13338691918/the-award-tour-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Award Tour</i></a>, ""Went from <i>Call of Duty</i> missions to the center of attention."" It's been a whirlwind year for the collective in general, but between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43120-more-iwatch-the-thronei-details-emerge/"" target=""_blank"">anchoring tracks for Jay and Kanye</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43660-tyler-the-creator-wins-two-vmas/"" target=""_blank"">winning VMAs</a>, it's easy to forget that Odd Future are largely made up of background figures, all with such varied rhyme and production styles that it can be hard to stand out from the pack. Mike G can probably relate-- his nocturnal flow and a preference for mood-driven beats has left him on the outside of most OF conversations. But still, G managed to find an audience with 2009's <a href=""http://oddfuture.tumblr.com/post/518876817/mike-g-ali"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ali</i></a>, a mixtape that former Pitchfork staffer Tom Breihan called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7940-odd-future-mixtapes/"" target=""_blank"">""something of a lost classic within the Odd Future catalog.""</a></p>
<p><i>The Award Tour</i> is the midpoint between <i>Ali </i>and G's proper debut, <i>Gold</i>, rumored to be out sometime next year. And while it doesn't diverge too much from his previous solo effort, it's clear that he's trying to make a name for himself outside of Odd Future: Save from keeping the production in-house (Syd the Kid, Hodgy Beats, and Left Brain contribute music) and the occasional reminiscence (see <a href=""http://onethirtybpm.com/media/mp3-mike-g-chevron/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chevron""</a>) or shout out, <i>The Award Tour</i> is one of the rare OF releases that feels purposefully removed from the collective. It's a smart move for someone who has struggled to distinguish himself outside of this growing pop-culture juggernaut, and with his sandy-eyed demeanor, it's a crucial counter-balance to the crew's super-aggro approach.</p>
<p>The only problem is Mike G himself. Spin <i>The Award Tour</i> half a dozen times, and it's clear why the guy's so often been relegated to the background. As the cousin of West Coast legend <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_G"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warren G</a>, it's not hard to imagine Mike's ultra laid-back style being something of a genetic trait, but even two years after <i>Ali</i>, he still sounds like a rapper not only still trying to find his voice, but struggling with the basic mechanics. Maybe it's okay to give Mike G a pass because of the inherent charm associated with his zonked-out delivery, or because his raps oddly memorialize the halcyon days of early Odd Future, but his flow remains so stilted that he often isn't even afforded the luxury of simply blending in.</p>
<p>Either jamming too many words into a measure, or too few, he sounds in need of a metronome, his flat and direct observations sounding like unstable free-association raps, when they most clearly weren't intended to be. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9pPEXOZIs4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chanel""</a> (which finds G in lothario mode) features some chintzed-out Euro-club signifiers which complement his drawl nicely, but watch him peacock by spitting in double-time and getting completely stranded trying to find a way back to his normal operational mode. Most of the time, he simply sounds lifeless and a little unfocused, which is especially hard to take when the content of his rhymes remain so plain and thin. Meanwhile, it leaves his production team to look more like enablers than anything else, offering what sounds like compartmentalized, simplistic, hand-me-down beats that G constantly finds himself inexplicably swallowed by.</p>
<p>But <i>The Award Tour</i>'s biggest problem? Showcasing buddy <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHSDrIzOS9w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vince Staples</a> for half the EP's 26 minutes. He appears on five of the seven tracks, including the Mike G-less <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyBQkg4xuCA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Michael Douglas""</a> with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WJFjXtHcy4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gucci Gucci""</a> co-writer Speak!, and where G comes off D.O.A., Staples is waiting to step in with personality and rhymes that practically crackle with life in comparison. Maybe he's a bit hung up on the played-out sort of violent juvenilia that first grabbed headlines for OF, but there's something about his verses on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsczP2ajdw4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Vicks""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFivJY7ZNVQ&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Award Tour""</a> (both detail school shootings, suicide fantasies, and Staples' conflicted feelings about religion) that are compellingly reminiscent of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcJiu4jXfTk&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Perkins' chat with himself</a> at the end of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054215/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Psycho</i></a>. The demon-exorcising feels authentic and dynamic, and downright scene-stealing when propped up against our host.</p>
<p>Maybe Mike G just isn't a show-and-prove kind of rapper, and maybe he doesn't need to be. But you've got to offer your listeners something to sink their teeth into if you're going to follow, ""More complex than architects with any amount of layers,"" with, ""Life's a videogame, I'm controlled by the best player,"" and expect to get away with it. <i>Gold</i> might find G in a more ambitious headspace artistically-- while it sure isn't an engaging listen, there's nothing on <i>The Award Tour</i> that suggests he can't come into his own-- but this EP also seems doomed to be lost in the greater Odd Future catalog. Except this time, no one's going to mistake it for a classic.</p></div>"|16110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16110-mike-g-the-award-tour-ep/|5.5|Zach Kelly

Right next to these acts on 4AD, meanwhile, was something even more cryptic, a band that never toured, that never really was a band at all: <a href=""http://4ad.com/artists/thismortalcoil"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">This Mortal Coil</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This Mortal Coil, the subject of a new comprehensive box set, was in the public eye an encapsulation of 4AD's sound and style spread out over three albums and associated singles and one-offs. And though founder Ivo Watts-Russell didn't want This Mortal Coil to be seen as a label vanity project, there was nothing more classically ""4AD"" from a listener's point of view. Despite the presence of so many performers not signed to the label and the fact that nothing else on 4AD actually <i>sounded</i> like This Mortal Coil, nothing else spoke more to the idea of what the label seemed to be.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The band's identity came not from a specific individual person or group of people but from a sprawling series of studio efforts, packaged in moody cover designs courtesy of photographer Nigel Grierson and designer Vaughn Oliver and always featuring model Pallas Citroen, a kind of monolithic, black-and-white take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"" target=""_blank"">Roxy Music</a>'s own remarkable run of covers over an earlier decade. Producer/engineer John Fryer, Watts-Russell's key collaborator across the releases, helped maintain a mood of poised, shadowy romanticism, part dark ambient grind and part late-night string-laden recital. This approach to production was combined with Watts-Russell's desire to celebrate obscure songs both old and more recent and transform them into something new and stunning. The project offered a mix of familiar and unknown voices and songs, performers sometimes appearing only for a single song, even simply an instrumental (such as Dead Can Dance associate Peter Ulrich, taking a bow on <i>Filigree &amp; Shadow</i> with the percussion piece <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jy4CtVWbkg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""At First, and Then""</a>, never to reappear).</p>
<p>The first album, 1984's <i>It'll End in Tears,</i> can't escape being dominated by the group's most famous track-- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mUmdR69nbM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Song to the Siren""</a>, a song by Tim Buckley recorded for his album <i>Starsailor and </i>recast by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"" target=""_blank"">Cocteau Twins</a>' Elizabeth Fraser and Robin Guthrie into a gripping vocal-and-guitar-only performance that has since completely overshadowed the original. First recorded as a B-side for TMC's debut single from 1983, ""Song to the Siren""'s success prompted Watts-Russell to continue with a full-length. It's to his credit that his stated ambition to not simply have a 4AD house band actually came true. The voice of <i>Tears </i>is, if anyone, Cindytalk's Gordon Sharp, ranging from operatic bravura on the opening cover of Big Star's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYon5LMyU7M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Kanga Roo""</a> to the closing tenderness of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNDEh442858"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Single Wish""</a>. But even that's too simplistic a summary on an album ranging, seemingly haphazardly, from the murky atmospherics of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCuxZm9Mm4k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fyt""</a> to the blunt, mechanistic rockout making up their version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a> member Colin Newman's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFqfD0tU7ZY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Not Me""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Filigree &amp; Shadow </i>from 1986 comes across as a more unified effort in comparison, released as a double album and with each of its four sides planned as a self-contained unit, songs flowing one into the other. If nothing towers above the rest like ""Song to the Siren"" did, the tradeoff lies in the record's feeling of dramatic concentration. Something like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL3Q-5MjaIw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Want to Live""</a>, a song taken from an obscure 1972 album on Elektra by Gary Ogan and Bill Lamb and given a remarkable reworking by sister singers Deirdre and Louise Rutkowski, can coexist with ominous near-industrial level pieces like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx3lM5zTwLQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Heart of Glass""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x1G_9Fjx6s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Horizon Bleeds and Sucks Its Thumb""</a>. Yet it all works in the end, from fragile strings on another Newman cover, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAExoKUICT8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Alone""</a>, to the dark funk guitar on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"" target=""_blank"">Talking Heads</a>' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWJozNRVHw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Drugs""</a>, and no one song moment can fully convey the record's range.</p>
<p><i>Blood</i>, another double-album release rom 1991, feels in retrospect like the ending of multiple eras, with 4AD about to open L.A. offices and a new decade about to embrace homegrown noise. But in some ways this felt like the most American record they'd done yet, given cover choices like Spirit, the Byrds, and Emmylou Harris via Rodney Crowell (not to mention a return of sorts to Big Star via Chris Bell's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwbtWTqbsbE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Am the Cosmos""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsm3NYBhvSY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You and Your Sister""</a>, the latter featuring a duet between Kim Deal and Tanya Donelly). Listening to it again in a time when styles are so easily appropriated, it's actually shocking to hear a band approach those sources so intent on reinterpreting them in their own image. From the opening original <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPot3YW9Ds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Lacemaker""</a>, all strings, echoes, and tones, to the slow stomp and grind of ""Ruddy and Wretched"" and a delicate version of Mary Margaret O'Hara's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY454lp2FHU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Help Me Lift You Up""</a>-- and even the almost light breakbeats of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuSZPPrFeGM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Loose Joints""</a>--  it's another catch-all that holds together.</p>
<p>This collection is the second time that the three albums have been presented in a box set-- the first time, in 1993, included a fourth disc that featured the original versions of the many songs that TMC covered. Besides updated remastering and a new overall presentation, there's a new fourth disc here, <i>Dust and Guitars</i>, consisting of those previously mentioned non-album releases, including the ""16 Days/Gathering Dust"" medley from their first single, two unreleased songs from a planned 1992 Rough Trade single, and various single remixes. When those original songs TMC reworked can now be easily put together on a playlist via YouTube or Spotify, the actual physical sight of this comprehensive set helps reinforce what made this project special. It feels like one last nod toward the idea of 4AD-as-artistic-construction, a final opportunity for something a little more permanent.</p></div>"|16115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16115-this-mortal-coil/|9.0|Ned Raggett

And though founder Ivo Watts-Russell didn't want This Mortal Coil to be seen as a label vanity project, there was nothing more classically ""4AD"" from a listener's point of view. Despite the presence of so many performers not signed to the label and the fact that nothing else on 4AD actually <i>sounded</i> like This Mortal Coil, nothing else spoke more to the idea of what the label seemed to be.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The band's identity came not from a specific individual person or group of people but from a sprawling series of studio efforts, packaged in moody cover designs courtesy of photographer Nigel Grierson and designer Vaughn Oliver and always featuring model Pallas Citroen, a kind of monolithic, black-and-white take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"" target=""_blank"">Roxy Music</a>'s own remarkable run of covers over an earlier decade. Producer/engineer John Fryer, Watts-Russell's key collaborator across the releases, helped maintain a mood of poised, shadowy romanticism, part dark ambient grind and part late-night string-laden recital. This approach to production was combined with Watts-Russell's desire to celebrate obscure songs both old and more recent and transform them into something new and stunning. The project offered a mix of familiar and unknown voices and songs, performers sometimes appearing only for a single song, even simply an instrumental (such as Dead Can Dance associate Peter Ulrich, taking a bow on <i>Filigree &amp; Shadow</i> with the percussion piece <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jy4CtVWbkg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""At First, and Then""</a>, never to reappear).</p>
<p>The first album, 1984's <i>It'll End in Tears,</i> can't escape being dominated by the group's most famous track-- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mUmdR69nbM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Song to the Siren""</a>, a song by Tim Buckley recorded for his album <i>Starsailor and </i>recast by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"" target=""_blank"">Cocteau Twins</a>' Elizabeth Fraser and Robin Guthrie into a gripping vocal-and-guitar-only performance that has since completely overshadowed the original. First recorded as a B-side for TMC's debut single from 1983, ""Song to the Siren""'s success prompted Watts-Russell to continue with a full-length. It's to his credit that his stated ambition to not simply have a 4AD house band actually came true. The voice of <i>Tears </i>is, if anyone, Cindytalk's Gordon Sharp, ranging from operatic bravura on the opening cover of Big Star's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYon5LMyU7M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Kanga Roo""</a> to the closing tenderness of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNDEh442858"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Single Wish""</a>. But even that's too simplistic a summary on an album ranging, seemingly haphazardly, from the murky atmospherics of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCuxZm9Mm4k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fyt""</a> to the blunt, mechanistic rockout making up their version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a> member Colin Newman's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFqfD0tU7ZY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Not Me""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Filigree &amp; Shadow </i>from 1986 comes across as a more unified effort in comparison, released as a double album and with each of its four sides planned as a self-contained unit, songs flowing one into the other. If nothing towers above the rest like ""Song to the Siren"" did, the tradeoff lies in the record's feeling of dramatic concentration. Something like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL3Q-5MjaIw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Want to Live""</a>, a song taken from an obscure 1972 album on Elektra by Gary Ogan and Bill Lamb and given a remarkable reworking by sister singers Deirdre and Louise Rutkowski, can coexist with ominous near-industrial level pieces like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx3lM5zTwLQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Heart of Glass""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x1G_9Fjx6s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Horizon Bleeds and Sucks Its Thumb""</a>. Yet it all works in the end, from fragile strings on another Newman cover, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAExoKUICT8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Alone""</a>, to the dark funk guitar on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"" target=""_blank"">Talking Heads</a>' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWJozNRVHw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Drugs""</a>, and no one song moment can fully convey the record's range.</p>
<p><i>Blood</i>, another double-album release rom 1991, feels in retrospect like the ending of multiple eras, with 4AD about to open L.A. offices and a new decade about to embrace homegrown noise. But in some ways this felt like the most American record they'd done yet, given cover choices like Spirit, the Byrds, and Emmylou Harris via Rodney Crowell (not to mention a return of sorts to Big Star via Chris Bell's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwbtWTqbsbE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Am the Cosmos""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsm3NYBhvSY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You and Your Sister""</a>, the latter featuring a duet between Kim Deal and Tanya Donelly). Listening to it again in a time when styles are so easily appropriated, it's actually shocking to hear a band approach those sources so intent on reinterpreting them in their own image. From the opening original <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQPot3YW9Ds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Lacemaker""</a>, all strings, echoes, and tones, to the slow stomp and grind of ""Ruddy and Wretched"" and a delicate version of Mary Margaret O'Hara's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY454lp2FHU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Help Me Lift You Up""</a>-- and even the almost light breakbeats of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuSZPPrFeGM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Loose Joints""</a>--  it's another catch-all that holds together.</p>
<p>This collection is the second time that the three albums have been presented in a box set-- the first time, in 1993, included a fourth disc that featured the original versions of the many songs that TMC covered. Besides updated remastering and a new overall presentation, there's a new fourth disc here, <i>Dust and Guitars</i>, consisting of those previously mentioned non-album releases, including the ""16 Days/Gathering Dust"" medley from their first single, two unreleased songs from a planned 1992 Rough Trade single, and various single remixes. When those original songs TMC reworked can now be easily put together on a playlist via YouTube or Spotify, the actual physical sight of this comprehensive set helps reinforce what made this project special. It feels like one last nod toward the idea of 4AD-as-artistic-construction, a final opportunity for something a little more permanent.</p></div>"|16115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16115-this-mortal-coil/|8.7|Ned Raggett

But somehow, 25-year old Bristol-bred Emika pulls off ""Common Exchange"" with flying Grisaille colors. Chalk its success up to the electronic composer/sound designer's belief that life and dance music alike are fatally boring when you stick to the blueprint.</p>
<p>Emika's self-titled debut is one of those rip-it-up-and-start-again records. That's not to say that she isn't descended from a tradition of pitch-black and borderless artists, but rather that her influences are varied enough to strand you on Spotify for several hours. There are the obvious trip-hop antecedents: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"" target=""_blank"">Portishead</a>, the artists on Ninja Tune (Emika's label, where she once interned); there's the THC residue of the dubstep pioneers with whom she's collaborated: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5922-pinch/"" target=""_blank"">Pinch</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22892-mala/"" target=""_blank"">Mala</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14226-digital-mystikz/"" target=""_blank"">Digital Mystikz</a>. Then there are the Bauhaus grooves absorbed during innumerable nights at German techno tabernacle Berghain, where she developed a close working relationship with club resident Marcel Dettmann.</p>
<p>If the above paragraph sounds like gibberish, let me re-translate: To the European underground, Emika is a golden child in somber pose. Even the eternally sober Thom Yorke recently endorsed Emika on the BBC and said, ""I hope she gets really famous."" She's not there yet, but it's not inconceivable. After all, few artists emerge as fully formed and self-sufficient. She writes, she produces, sings, plays piano, digital sequencers, and synthesizers. Her old day job was fittingly in sound design for the music software firm Native Instruments. The professional inclination is revealed amidst the poison fog of <i>Emika</i>, a record that's both experimental and precise, well caffeinated and focused, yet always deliberate in its approach.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, dubstep has slowly seeped into the bloodstream of mainstream pop. Everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6916-britney-spears/"" target=""_blank"">Britney</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"" target=""_blank"">Rihanna</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2327-korn/"" target=""_blank"">Korn</a> and (maybe) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye</a> have incorporated flourishes or wholesale ideas.<span> </span>In England, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29414-katy-b/"" target=""_blank"">Katy B</a> is a star, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14235-skream/"" target=""_blank"">Skream</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28028-benga/"" target=""_blank"">Benga</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22494-joker/"" target=""_blank"">Joker</a> have made moves toward the masses with varying success. But the pop realm and the dingy warehouse grime of early dubstep have largely been mutually incompatible. At best, they swap melody for rawness. At worst, they boast the street grit of a Flo Rida and David Guetta MDMA orgy.</p>
<p>Setting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"" target=""_blank"">the xx</a> aside, Emika comes as close as anyone to bridging the minimalist menace of the 2005-08 run on the Punch Drunk and Tectonic labels to breathy accessible vocals and classical piano.<span> </span>There's enough violence and double-crossing here to fill up a Rihanna record.<span> </span>Single ""Double Edge"" finds Emika moaning damaged syllables of emotional betrayal. ""Professional Loving"" finds her mulling the hollow, workaday love she experienced at her old office in Berlin. ""The Long Goodbye"" finds Emika emulating Beth Gibbons, wraith-like and ethereal, eulogizing friendships that never were.</p>
<p>But at its core, this is about the beats, as silvery and scalloped as a Frank Gehry facade. It's a slippery record, careful to never show Emika's face too clearly. She picks her spots smartly, aware that the mechanized doom rattles, cavernous silences, and multi-mirrored infinity of the production is powerful enough. This is the product of a dynamic and assured vision, one that retains an alluring sense of mystery. No matter how far Emika dances into the light, she never quite eludes the shadows.</p></div>"|16114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16114-emika-emika/|7.4|Jeff Weiss

The performance was an arresting, and very literal, visual representation of the song's claim of there being ""a million of us just like me."" Pittsburgh rapper <a href=""http://www.macmillerofficial.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mac Miller</a> is having his ""'The Real Slim Shady' at the VMAS"" moment right now, even if he'll never actually perform there. There are hundreds of thousands of listeners trailing him intensely-- <i>Blue Slide Park</i> sold just about 145,000 copes in its first week in stores, making it the first independently distributed debut album to go No. 1 in 16 years. And the reason Miller's mass of fans follow him is not because of his music, at least not completely. It's because he looks just like them, because they can see themselves up on the stage behind him, if not next to him.</p>
<p>It's a presumptive conclusion, but it's hard to find much, if anything, in Miller's music that suggests otherwise. He is an outsider, but he brings no outsider's perspective to his music. Forget Eminem, Miller's point of view is less unique than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27731-asher-roth/"" target=""_blank"">Asher Roth</a>'s or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30074-childish-gambino/"" target=""_blank"">Childish Gambino</a>'s. He lusts after fame, money, and women, and he smokes weed and parties. Obviously, there's nothing wrong with that; it is rap music, of course. But it does raise the question of why Miller is so popular, because despite his claim of being a cross between John Lennon and UGK, he's mostly just a crushingly bland, more intolerable version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"" target=""_blank"">Wiz Khalifa</a> without the chops, desire, or pocketbook for enjoyable singles. Unless you buy into Miller's persona-- and why would you?-- <i>Blue Slide Park</i> offers you nothing that you can't find done more much artfully by, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a>.</p>
<p>This is, in a way, rap music's fault. Mac Miller has been called ""frat rap,"" and while there's a slight truth to that, the term leaves unacknowledged the fact that frat guys used to engage with the rap world writ large. That interaction may have involved an unhealthy appreciation for Jurassic 5, but it also involved rocking YoungbloodZ and Ying Yang Twins songs at parties. The pop world has left rap behind, save four or five rappers, and it's opened a door for someone like Mac Miller to seize the college-aged, white-male fanbase. If that fanbase is interacting less with rap music, then maybe they've rallied around Miller because he also barely engages with the wider rap world. Consider the fact that <i>Blue Slide Park </i>has not one feature-- not a guest verse or chorus. For a contemporary rap album, let alone a No. 1 rap album, that is basically unheard-of. Before you consider that to be a noble pursuit, the album could've used somebody, <i>anybody</i>, to break up the monotony of Miller on the mic.</p>
<p>Miller's world is a hermetic one, and unless it's one you inhabit, the album holds no appeal. It's a normal rap album, sure, but as listeners we should strive for more than a no-stakes work by a guy wearing the same streetwear brands and snapbacks as everyone else, who has merely found a niche and exploited it. Miller's hustle can't be knocked, and it shouldn't be, but his art is 144,487 times less remarkable than his first week sales numbers would have you believe. His success is not a mirage, no. But it is a projection.</p></div>"|16113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16113-blue-side-park/|1.0|Jordan Sargent

It's one of the world's least developed countries, a place people leave so they can support their families back home with the living they make abroad. Its president has his own private plane, but less than 30% of its people can read and write, though a two-decade-long campaign has improved the literacy rate from about 13% 20 years ago. But if there's anything searching for music from around the world will teach you, it's that people find a way.</p>
<p>Back in the 1970s, Burkina Faso was still called Upper Volta. The name was a leftover from the country's colonial era, when the French ruled it as part of their West African empire. The decade was a time of relative political stability-- the country was ruled by a series of military and civil-military governments, but they were all led by the same man: Lt. Col. Sangoul<span>é</span> Lamizana. In the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, a cosmopolitan nightlife had been brewing since the early post-war years, and largely through patronage and foreign connections, a few bands had scraped together the necessary equipment to play a modern repertoire of calypsos, rumbas, highlife tunes, waltzes, and foxtrots. The country's fledgling music industry crystallized in 1974 around two Ouaga-based labels: Volta Discobel and CVD (Club Volta<span>ï</span>que du Disque).</p>
<p>It's this second label that features most prominently on <i>Bambara Mystic Soul</i>, Analog Africa's first foray into cataloging the little-known music of this landlocked country. Analog Africa founder Samy Ben Redjeb began this project back in 2006 after coming across a few Burkinab<span>é</span> records in Niamey, Niger. He visited Ouagadougou and quickly got in contact with Moussa Ouedraogo, the manager of CVD and brother of the company's founder, Adama Ouedraogo. In addition to extensive interviews conducted with some of the musicians featured on the compilation, the liner notes feature Redjeb's account of his crash-course in musique Volta<span>ï</span>que, as well as a humorously harrowing account of an argument between the Ouedraogo brothers and Amadou Ballak<span>é</span> over how to split royalties from a prospective Analog Africa release.</p>
<p>Ballak<span>é is the star of the show here-- six of the disc's 16 tracks feature his booming, nimble vocals-- so the fact that he and the brothers hammered out a deal was essential to getting the compilation together. Ballaké, born Amadou Traoré (his stage name comes from a hit song he wrote called ""Ballaké""), had played in big groups in Mali and Guinea before returning to Ouagadougou, where he became the music scene's most prominent fixture. In his hometown, the recording conditions were a lot rougher than the ones he'd experienced outside the country-- many recordings were made at the national theater and other venues with a two-track Nagra recorder borrowed from the national radio station-- but the rawness and immediacy suits him well. Whether he's being backed by filthy ""Sex Machine"" guitars on ""Oye Ka Bara Kignan"" or singing sweetly over a hypnotic, air-filled Mandé jazz arrangement, his facility with rhythm is astonishing.</span></p>
<p>Ballak<span>é’s international profile makes him an outlier on this compilation-- most of the other artists here have rarely been heard outside their homeland. There's not a single track that disappoints, though. Recording time was a very scarce resource in 1970s Burkina Faso, so bands came with their very best when they got the opportunity, and they were well-honed units from night after night of relentless gigging. Mamo Lagbema's ""Zambo-Zambo"" is a tightly performed, intensely funky workout with a slippery rhythm, deft horn arrangement and compex, interlocking guitar and bass parts, and the recording has amazing depth. It's hard to believe it was recorded live to two tracks. Clearly, experience with this rudimentary recording set-up paid off.</span></p>
<p>This is the sort of release where a review could very easily devolve into a simple accounting of the awesome things each track does-- the way the unique piano part on Tidiani Coulibaly's ""Sie Koumgolo"" bridges a gap between Cuban music and hard funk, for instance-- but that would make for some long reading. Instead, let me say that if you have any interest in West African funk forms at all, this is essential listening. It's also essential reading. The interviews and travelogue are excellent, but just as valuable is the history of modern Burkinabé music contributed by Craig Taylor, owner of the excellent but under-distributed Savannahphone label, the only other Western label to release a compilation of Burkinabé dance bands.</p>
<p>A compilation like this may not really shed a whole lot of light on the country the music comes from as a whole-- these musicians were urbanites, guys who used their talent to forge atypical, middle-class identities. The records they cut couldn't be played in a lot of the villages dotted through the countryside. But the music they made was real. It forged a cultural connection to the wider world from a somewhat isolated society, a country off the most frequently beaten paths. The party came to a crashing end in the 1980s, when a series of coups and short-lived governments put a squeeze on the nightlife in the cities. These recordings from the 1970s survived, though, and now we have them to hear again.</p></div>"|16109.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16109-bambara-mystic-soul-the-raw-sound-of-burkina-faso-1974-1979/|8.5|Joe Tangari

Home to artists like Nathan Fake, Luke Abbott, and, of course Holden himself, it has a habit of drenching techno in longing nostalgia and stasis, music caught in some dimensional rift between dance and pop. It seems a likely home for Swiss artist <a href=""http://www.kate-wax.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kate Wax</a> then, who made her name six years ago on bizarre spoken-word electronica on Mental Groove, but whose sound has slowly gelled into something more palatable, and certainly more traditionally pop. On her first album for Border Community and second overall, Aisha Devi Enz buries herself in a dark, claustrophobic world blanketed with careful textures both prickly and enticing, and tries to tunnel her way back using mostly her elastic but childlike voice.</p>
<p>With <i>Dust Collision,</i> Enz refigures herself as an alien vixen à la Karin Dreijier, her intensely smoky sensuality problematized by intense vocal processing and pitch manipulation. Vocals are <i>Collision</i>'s key feature, its only constant and the element that haunts its darkest corners. ""I Knit You""-- all chugging but suppressed arpeggios and layer after layer of tweaked vocal gasping-- makes an attractive, suitably weird opener, with lyrics about ""heathen scars"" and carving names into kitchen walls. The menacing verses are underlaid by a catchy falsetto chorus. Even when her vocals are the primary focus, they're still occluded, weaving in and out of each other and interrogating several different moods and states at once. By keeping her untouched cadence in tow (""Human Twin""), the manipulation only serves to emphasize her quavering vulnerability. It's gasping innocence versus jaded hostility, and this sort of dynamic push-and-pull, defines <i>Dust Collision</i>, an album that feels permanently at odds with itself and never quite comfortable in its own skin.</p>
<p>Part of that contrast manifests itself in an ongoing duel between the organic and the artificial, an unstable gradient that constantly tugs the album in opposite directions. Moving past the rubbery ""Dancing on Your Scalp"", <i>Collision</i> enters a phase of unnervingly stark sparsity. ""Human Twin"" and ""Archetype"" are driven mostly by piano, relatively simple singer-songwriter material quietly vandalized by synths, metronomic drums, or fits of distortion. It all leads toward the fantastic ""Maze Rider (Live From the Cave)"", an embellished live recording complete with sumptuous reverb, microphone feedback, and Enz's most riveting vocal melody. It feels uncharacteristically natural-- bar the ever-present vocal processing-- and it stands boldly naked at the center of the album, all strong, pure melody with little else to back it up. It's almost enough to make us question whether the heavy-handed effects are necessary in the first place.</p>
<p>But when the electronics do return, they're on the fritz-- ""Echoes and the Light"" sounds like it's shorting out with each brutal chord stab-- until the record strips itself down again and crawls back into its pseudo-acoustic cubbyhole, more fragile than ever. (Enz's personality begins to splinter across anxious soliloquies as she cries lyrics like ""mad thinker get out of my head."")  The closer ""Les Djinns"" is where the album's ever-edging tension finally gives way, and the uplifting but gentle melody explodes into bursts of harsh static and guitar moans before just fizzling out. It's just the kind of incongruous and torturously quick ending you'd expect from an album that feels like an hour of emotional infighting. (It's the burn-out of that album, one that exhausts itself trying to express emotions with such an odd and unintuitive palette.)</p>
<p>Just as it exhausts itself, <i>Dust Collision</i> can have a similar effect on its listeners. Breathing indulgently in and out without regard for how much space it takes up, <i>Collision </i>takes its sweet time to get its fraught message across, ever a rarity in an age of instant gratification. While her sound isn't quite fully developed yet-- the second half owes a lot to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4590-silent-shout/"" target=""_blank"">Silent Shout</a></i>-- she's impressively ambitious, toeing the line between two stratified worlds and refusing to give into the confines of either. She can pull off accessibly bare songwriting as well as textural tone-poems, finding formidable power in her singing both when it's untouched and heavily damaged. Damage courses throughout <i>Dust Collision</i>, and it's not the easiest listen, but like most difficult albums, it's eventually rewarding, and her vortex of haywire synths, quaking guitar, and unsettling helium squawks is powerfully magnetic.</p></div>"|16037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16037-kate-wax-dust-collision/|7.3|Andrew Ryce

So wrote Claude Bessy in the liner notes to <i>Throbbing Gristle's Greatest Hits</i>, one of the five classic <a href=""http://www.throbbing-gristle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Throbbing Gristle</a> albums Industrial Records have just reissued, and which now sit upon my desk, uncanny and accusatory, over 30 years after that pre-emptive fit of snark. Throbbing Gristle were never meant to be reliable, but here they come again, ready to be harvested by the very culture industry they alternately solicited and spat upon so long ago.</p>
<p>Permit me to adjust my obscene hairdo and offer those of you not already in the know some history: In their first incarnation as the Death Factory, they were the house band for Coum Transmissions, an abject performance-art troupe whose presentation of used tampons, anal syringes, and pornography featuring band member Cosey Fanny Tutti in the ICA gallery for their ""Prostitution"" show in 1976 earned them tabloid infamy and denunciations in Parliament as ""wreckers of civilization."" So far, so punk. But the music of the Death Factory, soon re-named Throbbing Gristle after a Yorkshire slang term for an erection, was a horse of a different color: ""industrial music for industrial people,"" a dystopian, negative form of what the band itself called ""post-psychedelic trash.""</p>
<p>While the rest of the Class of '77 pogoed steadily, Throbbing Gristle blew hot and cold, a passive-aggressive tug of war between the sharp and the slimy: The formal elegance of Chris Carter's synthesizers are scrawled upon by Genesis P-Orridge's bass riffs and Cosey Fanni Tutti's fuzz guitar freakouts, spiced with violin and dubby honks of cornet. This already pungent stew is spiked with taped material selected by Peter ""Sleazy"" Christopherson-- excerpts of everyday intimacy and true crime verité-- and the arsenic tang of Genesis' vocals, either sung in a soft sort of sprechstimme or howled into effects. On their debut, <i>The Second Annual Report</i>, the music alternately chugged along like a squelchy, crude cop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>, or stretched out into malingering new age, like a syphilitic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Tangerine Dream</a>. But they got both more virulent and more ambitious with time, upping the hostility and dread on <i>D.O.A</i>, taking a kitsch detour toward mutant disco on <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>, auto-cannibalizing their catalog in the live-in-the-studio ritual recording of <i>Heathen Earth</i>, and reasserting a strangely forceful collection of avant garde anti-pop for a <i>Greatest Hits</i> package revealingly subtitled <i>Entertainment Through Pain</i>, which collates their singles output as a quiver of tense stabs at accessibility.</p>
<p>In time for Christmas, a revived Industrial Records has just re-released all five of these classic albums, lovingly repackaged in deluxe gatefolded 2xCD editions. In each case, the original album is (wisely) preserved intact on one CD, while a second CD collects period singles, live performances, and a smattering of alternate mixes and unreleased material. Artwork is supplemented with alternate takes from photo-sessions, and it's a jarring experience for collector scum like myself to see and hear these goofy blooper reels and deleted scenes, in which the avatars of colder-than-thou aesthetics stand on one foot or giggle. Savvily recognizing the waning moment of the CD as such, there are vinyl editions of the albums too, which faithfully reprint the original artwork at full size and format. While so far I've only checked out the vinyl for <i>20 Jazz</i>, it looks drool-worthy and sounds far stronger than any other pressing that this fussy midget has encountered.</p>
<p>Given that these albums have stayed continuously in print for years through arrangements with Fetish Records, and later Mute, one must ask: Why bother paying attention to these reissues? In a triumphant vindication of sound over image, the real motivation for this re-presentation of a back catalog is that all five of these five albums have been remastered by Chris Carter himself, a labor of obsessive-compulsive love whose consequences I intend to unpack, album-by-album, below. On the face of it, the idea of an ""audiophile TG"" makes for a jarring proposition: The band always seemed weirdly proud of the dismal fidelity of its early recordings, and its stated objective was to be repellent and un-assimilable. As an early Coum Transmisions slogan put it, ""We Guarantee Disappointment."" However off-message, the immersive experience of these new versions redeems what might sound gratuitous, or merely greedy, about this gambit. It's the audio equivalent of a ""director's cut"" edition of a beloved series of seedy cult movies, something to file between your Kenneth Anger boxset and a Hermann Nitsch coffee-table tome.</p>
<p>Assessed as an archival work of restoration, it's a bullseye. I've been listening to these records for 25 years, and for me, this feels like the cleaning of the Sistine Chapel, if the Sistine Chapel were painted by Hieronymous Bosch instead of Michelangelo. Simply put, the heat and noise and grit and dirt and gristle is still there, but Chris Carter has finally put meat on the bones. There's simply more vitality and physicality to the music, and yet it still sounds ""very TG"": The harsh, brittle, and scalpel-sharp high end is preserved, but the kick drums are heavier, the riffs hit harder, and the field recordings now produce a tactile IMAX-theater immersion effect. But going beyond these side effects of possibly overheated fanboy devotion, the re-introduction of Throbbing Gristle into the cultural bloodstream also offers up a temperature-taking opportunity to assess both the entire arc of their career and the harder question of whom it might speak to today.</p>
<p><i><b>SECOND ANNUAL REPORT</b></i></p>
<p>Recorded in their rehearsal space and at various grubby gigs onto a Sony cassette recorder in a defiantly lo-fi manner in 1977, <i>Second Annual Report</i> makes an oddly recalcitrant candidate for a remastering job. Music this deliberately weedy was never going to please audiophiles, and the wags at Industrial Records know that even today this record is a tough sell. For sheer sangfroid, it's hard to beat a press sheet that boasts, ""Contains three different versions of 'Slug Bait', a song about eating a baby."" Talking about killing people isn't necessarily interesting (hello, Foster the People), but when I hear Genesis P-Orridge describe a businesslike psychopath butchering a family (""I cut his balls off with my knife (KNIFE); I make him eat them right there in front of his pregnant wife (WIFE)""), I still blink and twitch a little. The creeping dread <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojO3XvBIT0Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Slug Bait""</a> achieves lies not in the lyrical body count but in the hiccupping repetition of trigger words as Gen's vocal longjumps from a casual speaking voice to a garbled shriek, and in the deliberate misfit between the vocal's desperation and the detuned pastoral synths smeared underneath.</p>
<p>It's hard to say whether this was a raising or a lowering of the bar, but the bunker mentality of ""Industrial"" subculture as a power-obsessed stance of aesthetic nihilism wedded to nasty, lo-fi noise was born on this record, leaving a bloody trail for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4619-wolf-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Eyes</a>, Brainbombs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"" target=""_blank"">Prurient</a>, and others to follow into the present moment. As if that were not prescient enough, <i>Second Annual Report</i> counterbalances the bloodthirsty yang of its first eight songs with the yin of its long, brooding final track, the gauzy, scuttling, 20-minute soundtrack to the Coum Transmissions film ""After Cease to Exist"". Which is to say that, in 1977, TG already forecasted the ongoing migration of noise dudes toward new age (take a bow, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"" target=""_blank"">James Ferraro</a>), a sea-change which has been recursively washing over the underground for the past several years.</p>
<p><i><b>D.O.A.: THE THIRD AND FINAL REPORT OF THROBBING GRISTLE</b></i></p>
<p>Widely regarded as the band's finest hour, 1978's <i>D.O.A.</i> effortlessly surpasses <i>Second Annual Report</i> both in its ballsy, forceful execution and its passionate range. If TG are Fleetwood Mac, then <i>D.O.A</i> is their <i>Rumors</i>: the sound of a band alchemically transforming romantic upheaval into their sharpest statement. In a proggy gambit worthy of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, <i>D.O.A.</i> explodes the idea of a unified album into a suite of collective songs punctured by four solo pieces from each band member. Sleazy's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84N9qEQ-QB4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Valley of the Shadow of Death""</a> is a fetishistic fly-on-the-wall compilation of working-class men and boys talking shit, a sonic file folder of vanished moments that are naggingly unclear (Chit chat? Hustling?). Gen's melancholic pleading on his solo effort <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ-bu4dHV6k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Weeping""</a> couldn't be further from the tranquility of Cosey's idyllic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xd9QsBxzOw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hometime""</a>, and this polar juxtaposition flags the album's messy personal backstory (the album was recorded after Gen and Cosey's ongoing romance imploded, and Chris and Cosey's lifelong partnership began). But the standout solo track is surely Chris Carter's celestial arpeggio staircase <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYDtObWGEGk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""AB/7A""</a>, a clear influence upon the now-much-imitated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a> aesthetic of heart-tugging synth mandalas.</p>
<p>Counterbalancing these solitary excursions, the group efforts on this album are exhilaratingly bleak: From the chemtrails of distortion on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8riZnope7Ak"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hit By a Rock""</a> to the amplified sound of early computer code stored on cassette on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIPPcPzbOcI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I.B.M.""</a> to the final raveup of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfatCsJqa6Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Blood on the Floor""</a>, it's never less than car-crash fascinating. At the center of the record is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPrTUC7BDn4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hamburger Lady""</a>, a nightmarish vision of a burn victim's excruciatingly prolonged survival in the administered world of a high-tech hospital. It's probably Throbbing Gristle's greatest song, and it sounds tougher and more menacing than ever. The re-mastering has put a bass-jeep-worthy oomph into the low end of the kick drum, thickened the seasick, doomy bass dirge that, yes, throbs at its heart, and sharpened the edge of the scything central riff, a party horn run through a custom-built effects unit called the Gristleizer. Witch-house wishes it were this creepy, but even upside-down crosses won't save you from the horror of everyday life. A nauseating masterpiece, and an essential recording.</p>
<p><i><b>20 JAZZ FUNK GREATS</b></i></p>
<p>You could write an entire book about the sly wit and polymorphous slipperiness of <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>, whose kitsch seaside holiday photo on notorious suicide spot Beachy Head tips off the viewer to the deliberately fishy insincerity of its sonic contents. In a smash and grab that testifies to both increased musical ambition and a relentless urge to wrongfoot audience expectations, <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i> finds the band waking up from <i>D.O.A</i>'s dark night of the soul and feeling curiously frisky. Snacking on not only the titular funk and jazz, the band also takes touristic zig zags through exotica, rock, and disco. Like the alien mimic in John Carpenter's sci-fi horror film ""The Thing"", each song seems almost persuasive as a stab at these genres, but crucially twists itself out of alignment in a perverse reveal.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqnVneEBpgQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hot on the Heels of Love""</a> is a delirious slice of Moroder-esque boudoir-disco complete with breathy vocals from Cosey and, thanks to the remastering, a floor-filling low-end thump. The blueprint for 100% Silk's hipster-house shenanigans arguably starts here, with people who have no business taking over the dancefloor doing it anyway, with surprisingly solid results. An even stronger case for the critical re-thinking that mastering can achieve, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u0WBQhVAgA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Convincing People""</a>, which has previously struck me as a less-than-successful stab at a cynically collapsed political anthem, now sounds suitably fist-pumping. But the standout moment here is still <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCfqt74Jru8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Persuasion""</a>. Handcuffed to a plodding, two-note bass figure, Gen croons a narrative of pornographic photography sessions, which is punctured by squealing shards of Cosey's guitar and deeply unnerving tapes of unidentifiable people in compromising situations that seem to mingle distress, ecstasy, and pain. Tilting a repellent and yet seductive purr against found audio fragments, it's as if the crew of ""To Catch a Predator"" arrived too late to stop the Drake of ""Marvins Room"" from making a snuff film: once encountered, you can't hit undo.</p>
<p>But as much as TG tried to deliberately ""guarantee disappointment"" and mutate away from any signature, certain gestures had started to recur: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BXb6XoPkkA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Six Six Sixties""</a> ends this album in the riff rock grind-mode just as ""Blood on the Floor"" ended <i>D.O.A.</i> Patterns had begun to emerge, and the cumulative pressure of their own survival now forces the band members to work harder to surprise themselves. It's in the pathos of their promiscuous liasons with the forbidden territory of various forms of ""real music"" that this album generates a weirdly gripping power of its own. I am biased and perhaps lonely here, but this fussy midget regards it as their peak.</p>
<p><i><b>HEATHEN EARTH</b></i></p>
<p>A live-in-the-studio séance recorded in one take in front of a posse of friends and associates, I've always regarded <i>Heathen Earth</i> as the dog in the manger, sounding slightly stiff relative to the unhinged and abrasive live sound captured on the <i>TG24</i> boxset, which archives their scalding live gigs before frequently hostile crowds with less fidelity but more heart. The opening salvos of this concert draw upon songs and rhythmic tapes already deployed on <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>, and they sound tentative, fragmentary, slightly inhibited. But things begin to erupt when the whistling-led mirage of ""The World Is a War Film"" dissolves into a ripping version of ""Something Came Over Me"", turning that single into a propulsive, masturbatory launchpad for a swirling noise-dub overload which Carter's remastering has pumped into startling new prominence. Gen holds back from taking much of a vocal frontman position, and the result is a greater awareness of TG's ear for texture. It would take a spicerack of adjectives to do justice to the gnarled, twisted, flanged, and serrated soundworld conjured by the band's unique gear and more-is-more approach to processing. But it's a testimony to their precision that, for all their influence, nobody quite sounds like them when they are truly on blast, as they are here. Things come to a suitably frenzied peak in the stomping, cornet-led ""Don't Do as You're Told, Do as You Think"", in which Cosey's horn-through delay finally makes good on the clammy flirtations with jazz from <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>. Having promised a séance on a rainy afternoon, a relaxation technique cassette concludes the jam.</p>
<p><i><b>GREATEST HITS</b></i></p>
<p>Though they are taking the piss in passing themselves off as band who had ""hits,"" this compilation from 1980 of 7"" singles and assertive album tracks in fact does the trick nicely: It makes a first-rate introduction to the band and offers a less torturous entryway to their prickly, poisonous oeuvre than any particular album. The swells of ""Hamburger Lady"" start us off feeling nausea, and this bumpy ride builds in force from there. You can sense in this victory lap a kind of précis of their career arc that testifies to the strange tractor-beam effect of pop values on an experimental band. The single element from <i>Second Annual Report</i> is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9S5Y8nzz40"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tiab Guls""</a>, a backward version of ""Slug Bait"" that effectively censors the bloody lyrics by upstaging them into a blur. The perkiest and most uptempo high points of <i>D.O.A.</i> and <i>20 Jazz</i> dominate, and the cover, a pastiche of Arthur Lyman and Martin Denny exotica sleeves, tips its hats to the cover of <i>20 Jazz</i> as well. But the real peaks are the spiky singles <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_mKDKKySls"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""United""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgy64431FgA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Adrenalin""</a>, fantastically complete exercises in minimalistic synth-pop songwriting that imply an alternative universe in which Throbbing Gristle were just a fuzzier, more dyspeptic cousin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24311-john-foxx/"" target=""_blank"">John Foxx</a>.</p>
<p>I wish there were a hidden TG album with 20 more songs like these, and it just so happens that the bonus tracks on this CD are the most intriguing and fully formed, including alternative mixes of ""AB/7A"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf9KX6BI408"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Old Man Smiled""</a>. It is this full-speed-ahead electronic pop aspect of TG's lineage that aligns these pioneers of industrial music with the minimal synth, cold wave, and proto-techno revivalists of today. TG were crucial early pioneers of an aesthetic that now cuts a broad swathe across the audio landscape, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29479-martial-canterel/"" target=""_blank"">Martial Canterel</a>, the <a href=""http://wierdrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wierd Records</a> posse, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave/"" target=""_blank"">Cold Cave</a>, through to, arguably, lots of recent pop and R&amp;B production, where icy synths and stark drum patterns undergird alienated vocals ad infinitum.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's an unintended irony that a band so hostile to the very idea of ""music"" as such should have created recordings that have become enshrined into canonical constellations, but TG's influence has spiraled outwards as a direct result of their very unreliability and deviance. Thanks to the weird range and high quality of their catalog, separate strands of Throbbing Gristle's DNA are now entwined within the histories of electronic music, techno, dance music, goth aesthetics, occult subcultures, the avant edge of indie rock, and the entirety of the noise underground. It's a capitalist fairtytale born of hipster hindsight: The people who tried as hard as possible to make their audiences uncomfortable turned out to have a little bit of something for everyone.</p>
<p>In the wake of Sleazy's startling death in 2010, a kind of melancholic asymmetry has settled into place: the archive as mausoleum. The band can no longer re-unite and tour, though rumors and speculation continue to circulate about the ultimate fate of the extended recording sessions that the band tracked in London at the ICA for an extended deconstructive cover of the entirety of Nico's <i>Desertshore</i> album. In the wake of the decline of the CD and the seemingly inevitable slide downward in fidelity as the new brigade of information hunter-gatherers settle for the lossy, filed-shared free-for-all of torrents over the material culture of collectables, it's a perhaps deliberately out-of-step gesture to decide at precisely this point to remaster, repackage, and represent these Mosaic tablets of noise into upscale commodities memorializing a vanished moment of rebellion. So much for laughing in the face of historians, collectors, and revivalists.</p>
<p>Having the last laugh while seemingly anticipating this bittersweet outcome, Throbbing Gristle still don't add up: These albums are perversely inconclusive, by turns drably ugly and beautifully vital. However much Chris Carter has clarified their sound and stabilized their canon, the work itself remains as profoundly self-differential as ever. To cite a phrase the band used for its LP of the cut-ups of their icon and friend William S. Burroughs, there is ""Nothing here now but the recordings."" But those recordings have a funny way of coming to life. In 1981 in the <i>NME</i>, Paul Morley prophesized that ""one day TG's music will sound rich and sweet."" Thanks to Chris Carter's remastering and the necromancy of Industrial Records, that day has arrived.</p></div>"|16108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16108-throbbing-gristle/|8.6|Drew Daniel

So wrote Claude Bessy in the liner notes to <i>Throbbing Gristle's Greatest Hits</i>, one of the five classic <a href=""http://www.throbbing-gristle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Throbbing Gristle</a> albums Industrial Records have just reissued, and which now sit upon my desk, uncanny and accusatory, over 30 years after that pre-emptive fit of snark. Throbbing Gristle were never meant to be reliable, but here they come again, ready to be harvested by the very culture industry they alternately solicited and spat upon so long ago.</p>
<p>Permit me to adjust my obscene hairdo and offer those of you not already in the know some history: In their first incarnation as the Death Factory, they were the house band for Coum Transmissions, an abject performance-art troupe whose presentation of used tampons, anal syringes, and pornography featuring band member Cosey Fanny Tutti in the ICA gallery for their ""Prostitution"" show in 1976 earned them tabloid infamy and denunciations in Parliament as ""wreckers of civilization."" So far, so punk. But the music of the Death Factory, soon re-named Throbbing Gristle after a Yorkshire slang term for an erection, was a horse of a different color: ""industrial music for industrial people,"" a dystopian, negative form of what the band itself called ""post-psychedelic trash.""</p>
<p>While the rest of the Class of '77 pogoed steadily, Throbbing Gristle blew hot and cold, a passive-aggressive tug of war between the sharp and the slimy: The formal elegance of Chris Carter's synthesizers are scrawled upon by Genesis P-Orridge's bass riffs and Cosey Fanni Tutti's fuzz guitar freakouts, spiced with violin and dubby honks of cornet. This already pungent stew is spiked with taped material selected by Peter ""Sleazy"" Christopherson-- excerpts of everyday intimacy and true crime verité-- and the arsenic tang of Genesis' vocals, either sung in a soft sort of sprechstimme or howled into effects. On their debut, <i>The Second Annual Report</i>, the music alternately chugged along like a squelchy, crude cop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>, or stretched out into malingering new age, like a syphilitic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Tangerine Dream</a>. But they got both more virulent and more ambitious with time, upping the hostility and dread on <i>D.O.A</i>, taking a kitsch detour toward mutant disco on <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>, auto-cannibalizing their catalog in the live-in-the-studio ritual recording of <i>Heathen Earth</i>, and reasserting a strangely forceful collection of avant garde anti-pop for a <i>Greatest Hits</i> package revealingly subtitled <i>Entertainment Through Pain</i>, which collates their singles output as a quiver of tense stabs at accessibility.</p>
<p>In time for Christmas, a revived Industrial Records has just re-released all five of these classic albums, lovingly repackaged in deluxe gatefolded 2xCD editions. In each case, the original album is (wisely) preserved intact on one CD, while a second CD collects period singles, live performances, and a smattering of alternate mixes and unreleased material. Artwork is supplemented with alternate takes from photo-sessions, and it's a jarring experience for collector scum like myself to see and hear these goofy blooper reels and deleted scenes, in which the avatars of colder-than-thou aesthetics stand on one foot or giggle. Savvily recognizing the waning moment of the CD as such, there are vinyl editions of the albums too, which faithfully reprint the original artwork at full size and format. While so far I've only checked out the vinyl for <i>20 Jazz</i>, it looks drool-worthy and sounds far stronger than any other pressing that this fussy midget has encountered.</p>
<p>Given that these albums have stayed continuously in print for years through arrangements with Fetish Records, and later Mute, one must ask: Why bother paying attention to these reissues? In a triumphant vindication of sound over image, the real motivation for this re-presentation of a back catalog is that all five of these five albums have been remastered by Chris Carter himself, a labor of obsessive-compulsive love whose consequences I intend to unpack, album-by-album, below. On the face of it, the idea of an ""audiophile TG"" makes for a jarring proposition: The band always seemed weirdly proud of the dismal fidelity of its early recordings, and its stated objective was to be repellent and un-assimilable. As an early Coum Transmisions slogan put it, ""We Guarantee Disappointment."" However off-message, the immersive experience of these new versions redeems what might sound gratuitous, or merely greedy, about this gambit. It's the audio equivalent of a ""director's cut"" edition of a beloved series of seedy cult movies, something to file between your Kenneth Anger boxset and a Hermann Nitsch coffee-table tome.</p>
<p>Assessed as an archival work of restoration, it's a bullseye. I've been listening to these records for 25 years, and for me, this feels like the cleaning of the Sistine Chapel, if the Sistine Chapel were painted by Hieronymous Bosch instead of Michelangelo. Simply put, the heat and noise and grit and dirt and gristle is still there, but Chris Carter has finally put meat on the bones. There's simply more vitality and physicality to the music, and yet it still sounds ""very TG"": The harsh, brittle, and scalpel-sharp high end is preserved, but the kick drums are heavier, the riffs hit harder, and the field recordings now produce a tactile IMAX-theater immersion effect. But going beyond these side effects of possibly overheated fanboy devotion, the re-introduction of Throbbing Gristle into the cultural bloodstream also offers up a temperature-taking opportunity to assess both the entire arc of their career and the harder question of whom it might speak to today.</p>
<p><i><b>SECOND ANNUAL REPORT</b></i></p>
<p>Recorded in their rehearsal space and at various grubby gigs onto a Sony cassette recorder in a defiantly lo-fi manner in 1977, <i>Second Annual Report</i> makes an oddly recalcitrant candidate for a remastering job. Music this deliberately weedy was never going to please audiophiles, and the wags at Industrial Records know that even today this record is a tough sell. For sheer sangfroid, it's hard to beat a press sheet that boasts, ""Contains three different versions of 'Slug Bait', a song about eating a baby."" Talking about killing people isn't necessarily interesting (hello, Foster the People), but when I hear Genesis P-Orridge describe a businesslike psychopath butchering a family (""I cut his balls off with my knife (KNIFE); I make him eat them right there in front of his pregnant wife (WIFE)""), I still blink and twitch a little. The creeping dread <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojO3XvBIT0Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Slug Bait""</a> achieves lies not in the lyrical body count but in the hiccupping repetition of trigger words as Gen's vocal longjumps from a casual speaking voice to a garbled shriek, and in the deliberate misfit between the vocal's desperation and the detuned pastoral synths smeared underneath.</p>
<p>It's hard to say whether this was a raising or a lowering of the bar, but the bunker mentality of ""Industrial"" subculture as a power-obsessed stance of aesthetic nihilism wedded to nasty, lo-fi noise was born on this record, leaving a bloody trail for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4619-wolf-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Eyes</a>, Brainbombs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"" target=""_blank"">Prurient</a>, and others to follow into the present moment. As if that were not prescient enough, <i>Second Annual Report</i> counterbalances the bloodthirsty yang of its first eight songs with the yin of its long, brooding final track, the gauzy, scuttling, 20-minute soundtrack to the Coum Transmissions film ""After Cease to Exist"". Which is to say that, in 1977, TG already forecasted the ongoing migration of noise dudes toward new age (take a bow, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"" target=""_blank"">James Ferraro</a>), a sea-change which has been recursively washing over the underground for the past several years.</p>
<p><i><b>D.O.A.: THE THIRD AND FINAL REPORT OF THROBBING GRISTLE</b></i></p>
<p>Widely regarded as the band's finest hour, 1978's <i>D.O.A.</i> effortlessly surpasses <i>Second Annual Report</i> both in its ballsy, forceful execution and its passionate range. If TG are Fleetwood Mac, then <i>D.O.A</i> is their <i>Rumors</i>: the sound of a band alchemically transforming romantic upheaval into their sharpest statement. In a proggy gambit worthy of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, <i>D.O.A.</i> explodes the idea of a unified album into a suite of collective songs punctured by four solo pieces from each band member. Sleazy's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84N9qEQ-QB4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Valley of the Shadow of Death""</a> is a fetishistic fly-on-the-wall compilation of working-class men and boys talking shit, a sonic file folder of vanished moments that are naggingly unclear (Chit chat? Hustling?). Gen's melancholic pleading on his solo effort <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ-bu4dHV6k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Weeping""</a> couldn't be further from the tranquility of Cosey's idyllic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xd9QsBxzOw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hometime""</a>, and this polar juxtaposition flags the album's messy personal backstory (the album was recorded after Gen and Cosey's ongoing romance imploded, and Chris and Cosey's lifelong partnership began). But the standout solo track is surely Chris Carter's celestial arpeggio staircase <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYDtObWGEGk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""AB/7A""</a>, a clear influence upon the now-much-imitated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a> aesthetic of heart-tugging synth mandalas.</p>
<p>Counterbalancing these solitary excursions, the group efforts on this album are exhilaratingly bleak: From the chemtrails of distortion on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8riZnope7Ak"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hit By a Rock""</a> to the amplified sound of early computer code stored on cassette on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIPPcPzbOcI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I.B.M.""</a> to the final raveup of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfatCsJqa6Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Blood on the Floor""</a>, it's never less than car-crash fascinating. At the center of the record is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPrTUC7BDn4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hamburger Lady""</a>, a nightmarish vision of a burn victim's excruciatingly prolonged survival in the administered world of a high-tech hospital. It's probably Throbbing Gristle's greatest song, and it sounds tougher and more menacing than ever. The re-mastering has put a bass-jeep-worthy oomph into the low end of the kick drum, thickened the seasick, doomy bass dirge that, yes, throbs at its heart, and sharpened the edge of the scything central riff, a party horn run through a custom-built effects unit called the Gristleizer. Witch-house wishes it were this creepy, but even upside-down crosses won't save you from the horror of everyday life. A nauseating masterpiece, and an essential recording.</p>

So wrote Claude Bessy in the liner notes to <i>Throbbing Gristle's Greatest Hits</i>, one of the five classic <a href=""http://www.throbbing-gristle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Throbbing Gristle</a> albums Industrial Records have just reissued, and which now sit upon my desk, uncanny and accusatory, over 30 years after that pre-emptive fit of snark. Throbbing Gristle were never meant to be reliable, but here they come again, ready to be harvested by the very culture industry they alternately solicited and spat upon so long ago.</p>
<p>Permit me to adjust my obscene hairdo and offer those of you not already in the know some history: In their first incarnation as the Death Factory, they were the house band for Coum Transmissions, an abject performance-art troupe whose presentation of used tampons, anal syringes, and pornography featuring band member Cosey Fanny Tutti in the ICA gallery for their ""Prostitution"" show in 1976 earned them tabloid infamy and denunciations in Parliament as ""wreckers of civilization."" So far, so punk. But the music of the Death Factory, soon re-named Throbbing Gristle after a Yorkshire slang term for an erection, was a horse of a different color: ""industrial music for industrial people,"" a dystopian, negative form of what the band itself called ""post-psychedelic trash.""</p>
<p>While the rest of the Class of '77 pogoed steadily, Throbbing Gristle blew hot and cold, a passive-aggressive tug of war between the sharp and the slimy: The formal elegance of Chris Carter's synthesizers are scrawled upon by Genesis P-Orridge's bass riffs and Cosey Fanni Tutti's fuzz guitar freakouts, spiced with violin and dubby honks of cornet. This already pungent stew is spiked with taped material selected by Peter ""Sleazy"" Christopherson-- excerpts of everyday intimacy and true crime verité-- and the arsenic tang of Genesis' vocals, either sung in a soft sort of sprechstimme or howled into effects. On their debut, <i>The Second Annual Report</i>, the music alternately chugged along like a squelchy, crude cop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>, or stretched out into malingering new age, like a syphilitic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Tangerine Dream</a>. But they got both more virulent and more ambitious with time, upping the hostility and dread on <i>D.O.A</i>, taking a kitsch detour toward mutant disco on <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>, auto-cannibalizing their catalog in the live-in-the-studio ritual recording of <i>Heathen Earth</i>, and reasserting a strangely forceful collection of avant garde anti-pop for a <i>Greatest Hits</i> package revealingly subtitled <i>Entertainment Through Pain</i>, which collates their singles output as a quiver of tense stabs at accessibility.</p>
<p>In time for Christmas, a revived Industrial Records has just re-released all five of these classic albums, lovingly repackaged in deluxe gatefolded 2xCD editions. In each case, the original album is (wisely) preserved intact on one CD, while a second CD collects period singles, live performances, and a smattering of alternate mixes and unreleased material. Artwork is supplemented with alternate takes from photo-sessions, and it's a jarring experience for collector scum like myself to see and hear these goofy blooper reels and deleted scenes, in which the avatars of colder-than-thou aesthetics stand on one foot or giggle. Savvily recognizing the waning moment of the CD as such, there are vinyl editions of the albums too, which faithfully reprint the original artwork at full size and format. While so far I've only checked out the vinyl for <i>20 Jazz</i>, it looks drool-worthy and sounds far stronger than any other pressing that this fussy midget has encountered.</p>
<p>Given that these albums have stayed continuously in print for years through arrangements with Fetish Records, and later Mute, one must ask: Why bother paying attention to these reissues? In a triumphant vindication of sound over image, the real motivation for this re-presentation of a back catalog is that all five of these five albums have been remastered by Chris Carter himself, a labor of obsessive-compulsive love whose consequences I intend to unpack, album-by-album, below. On the face of it, the idea of an ""audiophile TG"" makes for a jarring proposition: The band always seemed weirdly proud of the dismal fidelity of its early recordings, and its stated objective was to be repellent and un-assimilable. As an early Coum Transmisions slogan put it, ""We Guarantee Disappointment."" However off-message, the immersive experience of these new versions redeems what might sound gratuitous, or merely greedy, about this gambit. It's the audio equivalent of a ""director's cut"" edition of a beloved series of seedy cult movies, something to file between your Kenneth Anger boxset and a Hermann Nitsch coffee-table tome.</p>
<p>Assessed as an archival work of restoration, it's a bullseye. I've been listening to these records for 25 years, and for me, this feels like the cleaning of the Sistine Chapel, if the Sistine Chapel were painted by Hieronymous Bosch instead of Michelangelo. Simply put, the heat and noise and grit and dirt and gristle is still there, but Chris Carter has finally put meat on the bones. There's simply more vitality and physicality to the music, and yet it still sounds ""very TG"": The harsh, brittle, and scalpel-sharp high end is preserved, but the kick drums are heavier, the riffs hit harder, and the field recordings now produce a tactile IMAX-theater immersion effect. But going beyond these side effects of possibly overheated fanboy devotion, the re-introduction of Throbbing Gristle into the cultural bloodstream also offers up a temperature-taking opportunity to assess both the entire arc of their career and the harder question of whom it might speak to today.</p>
<p><i><b>SECOND ANNUAL REPORT</b></i></p>
<p>Recorded in their rehearsal space and at various grubby gigs onto a Sony cassette recorder in a defiantly lo-fi manner in 1977, <i>Second Annual Report</i> makes an oddly recalcitrant candidate for a remastering job. Music this deliberately weedy was never going to please audiophiles, and the wags at Industrial Records know that even today this record is a tough sell. For sheer sangfroid, it's hard to beat a press sheet that boasts, ""Contains three different versions of 'Slug Bait', a song about eating a baby."" Talking about killing people isn't necessarily interesting (hello, Foster the People), but when I hear Genesis P-Orridge describe a businesslike psychopath butchering a family (""I cut his balls off with my knife (KNIFE); I make him eat them right there in front of his pregnant wife (WIFE)""), I still blink and twitch a little. The creeping dread <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojO3XvBIT0Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Slug Bait""</a> achieves lies not in the lyrical body count but in the hiccupping repetition of trigger words as Gen's vocal longjumps from a casual speaking voice to a garbled shriek, and in the deliberate misfit between the vocal's desperation and the detuned pastoral synths smeared underneath.</p>
<p>It's hard to say whether this was a raising or a lowering of the bar, but the bunker mentality of ""Industrial"" subculture as a power-obsessed stance of aesthetic nihilism wedded to nasty, lo-fi noise was born on this record, leaving a bloody trail for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4619-wolf-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Eyes</a>, Brainbombs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"" target=""_blank"">Prurient</a>, and others to follow into the present moment. As if that were not prescient enough, <i>Second Annual Report</i> counterbalances the bloodthirsty yang of its first eight songs with the yin of its long, brooding final track, the gauzy, scuttling, 20-minute soundtrack to the Coum Transmissions film ""After Cease to Exist"". Which is to say that, in 1977, TG already forecasted the ongoing migration of noise dudes toward new age (take a bow, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"" target=""_blank"">James Ferraro</a>), a sea-change which has been recursively washing over the underground for the past several years.</p>
<p><i><b>D.O.A.: THE THIRD AND FINAL REPORT OF THROBBING GRISTLE</b></i></p>
<p>Widely regarded as the band's finest hour, 1978's <i>D.O.A.</i> effortlessly surpasses <i>Second Annual Report</i> both in its ballsy, forceful execution and its passionate range. If TG are Fleetwood Mac, then <i>D.O.A</i> is their <i>Rumors</i>: the sound of a band alchemically transforming romantic upheaval into their sharpest statement. In a proggy gambit worthy of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, <i>D.O.A.</i> explodes the idea of a unified album into a suite of collective songs punctured by four solo pieces from each band member. Sleazy's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84N9qEQ-QB4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Valley of the Shadow of Death""</a> is a fetishistic fly-on-the-wall compilation of working-class men and boys talking shit, a sonic file folder of vanished moments that are naggingly unclear (Chit chat? Hustling?). Gen's melancholic pleading on his solo effort <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ-bu4dHV6k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Weeping""</a> couldn't be further from the tranquility of Cosey's idyllic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xd9QsBxzOw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hometime""</a>, and this polar juxtaposition flags the album's messy personal backstory (the album was recorded after Gen and Cosey's ongoing romance imploded, and Chris and Cosey's lifelong partnership began). But the standout solo track is surely Chris Carter's celestial arpeggio staircase <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYDtObWGEGk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""AB/7A""</a>, a clear influence upon the now-much-imitated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a> aesthetic of heart-tugging synth mandalas.</p>
<p>Counterbalancing these solitary excursions, the group efforts on this album are exhilaratingly bleak: From the chemtrails of distortion on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8riZnope7Ak"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hit By a Rock""</a> to the amplified sound of early computer code stored on cassette on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIPPcPzbOcI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I.B.M.""</a> to the final raveup of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfatCsJqa6Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Blood on the Floor""</a>, it's never less than car-crash fascinating. At the center of the record is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPrTUC7BDn4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hamburger Lady""</a>, a nightmarish vision of a burn victim's excruciatingly prolonged survival in the administered world of a high-tech hospital. It's probably Throbbing Gristle's greatest song, and it sounds tougher and more menacing than ever. The re-mastering has put a bass-jeep-worthy oomph into the low end of the kick drum, thickened the seasick, doomy bass dirge that, yes, throbs at its heart, and sharpened the edge of the scything central riff, a party horn run through a custom-built effects unit called the Gristleizer. Witch-house wishes it were this creepy, but even upside-down crosses won't save you from the horror of everyday life. A nauseating masterpiece, and an essential recording.</p>
<p><i><b>20 JAZZ FUNK GREATS</b></i></p>
<p>You could write an entire book about the sly wit and polymorphous slipperiness of <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>, whose kitsch seaside holiday photo on notorious suicide spot Beachy Head tips off the viewer to the deliberately fishy insincerity of its sonic contents. In a smash and grab that testifies to both increased musical ambition and a relentless urge to wrongfoot audience expectations, <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i> finds the band waking up from <i>D.O.A</i>'s dark night of the soul and feeling curiously frisky. Snacking on not only the titular funk and jazz, the band also takes touristic zig zags through exotica, rock, and disco. Like the alien mimic in John Carpenter's sci-fi horror film ""The Thing"", each song seems almost persuasive as a stab at these genres, but crucially twists itself out of alignment in a perverse reveal.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqnVneEBpgQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hot on the Heels of Love""</a> is a delirious slice of Moroder-esque boudoir-disco complete with breathy vocals from Cosey and, thanks to the remastering, a floor-filling low-end thump. The blueprint for 100% Silk's hipster-house shenanigans arguably starts here, with people who have no business taking over the dancefloor doing it anyway, with surprisingly solid results. An even stronger case for the critical re-thinking that mastering can achieve, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u0WBQhVAgA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Convincing People""</a>, which has previously struck me as a less-than-successful stab at a cynically collapsed political anthem, now sounds suitably fist-pumping. But the standout moment here is still <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCfqt74Jru8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Persuasion""</a>. Handcuffed to a plodding, two-note bass figure, Gen croons a narrative of pornographic photography sessions, which is punctured by squealing shards of Cosey's guitar and deeply unnerving tapes of unidentifiable people in compromising situations that seem to mingle distress, ecstasy, and pain. Tilting a repellent and yet seductive purr against found audio fragments, it's as if the crew of ""To Catch a Predator"" arrived too late to stop the Drake of ""Marvins Room"" from making a snuff film: once encountered, you can't hit undo.</p>
<p>But as much as TG tried to deliberately ""guarantee disappointment"" and mutate away from any signature, certain gestures had started to recur: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BXb6XoPkkA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Six Six Sixties""</a> ends this album in the riff rock grind-mode just as ""Blood on the Floor"" ended <i>D.O.A.</i> Patterns had begun to emerge, and the cumulative pressure of their own survival now forces the band members to work harder to surprise themselves. It's in the pathos of their promiscuous liasons with the forbidden territory of various forms of ""real music"" that this album generates a weirdly gripping power of its own. I am biased and perhaps lonely here, but this fussy midget regards it as their peak.</p>
<p><i><b>HEATHEN EARTH</b></i></p>
<p>A live-in-the-studio séance recorded in one take in front of a posse of friends and associates, I've always regarded <i>Heathen Earth</i> as the dog in the manger, sounding slightly stiff relative to the unhinged and abrasive live sound captured on the <i>TG24</i> boxset, which archives their scalding live gigs before frequently hostile crowds with less fidelity but more heart. The opening salvos of this concert draw upon songs and rhythmic tapes already deployed on <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>, and they sound tentative, fragmentary, slightly inhibited. But things begin to erupt when the whistling-led mirage of ""The World Is a War Film"" dissolves into a ripping version of ""Something Came Over Me"", turning that single into a propulsive, masturbatory launchpad for a swirling noise-dub overload which Carter's remastering has pumped into startling new prominence. Gen holds back from taking much of a vocal frontman position, and the result is a greater awareness of TG's ear for texture. It would take a spicerack of adjectives to do justice to the gnarled, twisted, flanged, and serrated soundworld conjured by the band's unique gear and more-is-more approach to processing. But it's a testimony to their precision that, for all their influence, nobody quite sounds like them when they are truly on blast, as they are here. Things come to a suitably frenzied peak in the stomping, cornet-led ""Don't Do as You're Told, Do as You Think"", in which Cosey's horn-through delay finally makes good on the clammy flirtations with jazz from <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>. Having promised a séance on a rainy afternoon, a relaxation technique cassette concludes the jam.</p>
<p><i><b>GREATEST HITS</b></i></p>
<p>Though they are taking the piss in passing themselves off as band who had ""hits,"" this compilation from 1980 of 7"" singles and assertive album tracks in fact does the trick nicely: It makes a first-rate introduction to the band and offers a less torturous entryway to their prickly, poisonous oeuvre than any particular album. The swells of ""Hamburger Lady"" start us off feeling nausea, and this bumpy ride builds in force from there. You can sense in this victory lap a kind of précis of their career arc that testifies to the strange tractor-beam effect of pop values on an experimental band. The single element from <i>Second Annual Report</i> is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9S5Y8nzz40"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tiab Guls""</a>, a backward version of ""Slug Bait"" that effectively censors the bloody lyrics by upstaging them into a blur. The perkiest and most uptempo high points of <i>D.O.A.</i> and <i>20 Jazz</i> dominate, and the cover, a pastiche of Arthur Lyman and Martin Denny exotica sleeves, tips its hats to the cover of <i>20 Jazz</i> as well. But the real peaks are the spiky singles <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_mKDKKySls"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""United""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgy64431FgA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Adrenalin""</a>, fantastically complete exercises in minimalistic synth-pop songwriting that imply an alternative universe in which Throbbing Gristle were just a fuzzier, more dyspeptic cousin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24311-john-foxx/"" target=""_blank"">John Foxx</a>.</p>
<p>I wish there were a hidden TG album with 20 more songs like these, and it just so happens that the bonus tracks on this CD are the most intriguing and fully formed, including alternative mixes of ""AB/7A"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf9KX6BI408"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Old Man Smiled""</a>. It is this full-speed-ahead electronic pop aspect of TG's lineage that aligns these pioneers of industrial music with the minimal synth, cold wave, and proto-techno revivalists of today. TG were crucial early pioneers of an aesthetic that now cuts a broad swathe across the audio landscape, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29479-martial-canterel/"" target=""_blank"">Martial Canterel</a>, the <a href=""http://wierdrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wierd Records</a> posse, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave/"" target=""_blank"">Cold Cave</a>, through to, arguably, lots of recent pop and R&amp;B production, where icy synths and stark drum patterns undergird alienated vocals ad infinitum.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's an unintended irony that a band so hostile to the very idea of ""music"" as such should have created recordings that have become enshrined into canonical constellations, but TG's influence has spiraled outwards as a direct result of their very unreliability and deviance. Thanks to the weird range and high quality of their catalog, separate strands of Throbbing Gristle's DNA are now entwined within the histories of electronic music, techno, dance music, goth aesthetics, occult subcultures, the avant edge of indie rock, and the entirety of the noise underground. It's a capitalist fairtytale born of hipster hindsight: The people who tried as hard as possible to make their audiences uncomfortable turned out to have a little bit of something for everyone.</p>
<p>In the wake of Sleazy's startling death in 2010, a kind of melancholic asymmetry has settled into place: the archive as mausoleum. The band can no longer re-unite and tour, though rumors and speculation continue to circulate about the ultimate fate of the extended recording sessions that the band tracked in London at the ICA for an extended deconstructive cover of the entirety of Nico's <i>Desertshore</i> album. In the wake of the decline of the CD and the seemingly inevitable slide downward in fidelity as the new brigade of information hunter-gatherers settle for the lossy, filed-shared free-for-all of torrents over the material culture of collectables, it's a perhaps deliberately out-of-step gesture to decide at precisely this point to remaster, repackage, and represent these Mosaic tablets of noise into upscale commodities memorializing a vanished moment of rebellion. So much for laughing in the face of historians, collectors, and revivalists.</p>
<p>Having the last laugh while seemingly anticipating this bittersweet outcome, Throbbing Gristle still don't add up: These albums are perversely inconclusive, by turns drably ugly and beautifully vital.

There's simply more vitality and physicality to the music, and yet it still sounds ""very TG"": The harsh, brittle, and scalpel-sharp high end is preserved, but the kick drums are heavier, the riffs hit harder, and the field recordings now produce a tactile IMAX-theater immersion effect. But going beyond these side effects of possibly overheated fanboy devotion, the re-introduction of Throbbing Gristle into the cultural bloodstream also offers up a temperature-taking opportunity to assess both the entire arc of their career and the harder question of whom it might speak to today.</p>
<p><i><b>SECOND ANNUAL REPORT</b></i></p>
<p>Recorded in their rehearsal space and at various grubby gigs onto a Sony cassette recorder in a defiantly lo-fi manner in 1977, <i>Second Annual Report</i> makes an oddly recalcitrant candidate for a remastering job. Music this deliberately weedy was never going to please audiophiles, and the wags at Industrial Records know that even today this record is a tough sell. For sheer sangfroid, it's hard to beat a press sheet that boasts, ""Contains three different versions of 'Slug Bait', a song about eating a baby."" Talking about killing people isn't necessarily interesting (hello, Foster the People), but when I hear Genesis P-Orridge describe a businesslike psychopath butchering a family (""I cut his balls off with my knife (KNIFE); I make him eat them right there in front of his pregnant wife (WIFE)""), I still blink and twitch a little. The creeping dread <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojO3XvBIT0Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Slug Bait""</a> achieves lies not in the lyrical body count but in the hiccupping repetition of trigger words as Gen's vocal longjumps from a casual speaking voice to a garbled shriek, and in the deliberate misfit between the vocal's desperation and the detuned pastoral synths smeared underneath.</p>
<p>It's hard to say whether this was a raising or a lowering of the bar, but the bunker mentality of ""Industrial"" subculture as a power-obsessed stance of aesthetic nihilism wedded to nasty, lo-fi noise was born on this record, leaving a bloody trail for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4619-wolf-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Eyes</a>, Brainbombs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"" target=""_blank"">Prurient</a>, and others to follow into the present moment. As if that were not prescient enough, <i>Second Annual Report</i> counterbalances the bloodthirsty yang of its first eight songs with the yin of its long, brooding final track, the gauzy, scuttling, 20-minute soundtrack to the Coum Transmissions film ""After Cease to Exist"". Which is to say that, in 1977, TG already forecasted the ongoing migration of noise dudes toward new age (take a bow, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"" target=""_blank"">James Ferraro</a>), a sea-change which has been recursively washing over the underground for the past several years.</p>
<p><i><b>D.O.A.: THE THIRD AND FINAL REPORT OF THROBBING GRISTLE</b></i></p>
<p>Widely regarded as the band's finest hour, 1978's <i>D.O.A.</i> effortlessly surpasses <i>Second Annual Report</i> both in its ballsy, forceful execution and its passionate range. If TG are Fleetwood Mac, then <i>D.O.A</i> is their <i>Rumors</i>: the sound of a band alchemically transforming romantic upheaval into their sharpest statement. In a proggy gambit worthy of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, <i>D.O.A.</i> explodes the idea of a unified album into a suite of collective songs punctured by four solo pieces from each band member. Sleazy's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84N9qEQ-QB4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Valley of the Shadow of Death""</a> is a fetishistic fly-on-the-wall compilation of working-class men and boys talking shit, a sonic file folder of vanished moments that are naggingly unclear (Chit chat? Hustling?). Gen's melancholic pleading on his solo effort <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ-bu4dHV6k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Weeping""</a> couldn't be further from the tranquility of Cosey's idyllic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xd9QsBxzOw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hometime""</a>, and this polar juxtaposition flags the album's messy personal backstory (the album was recorded after Gen and Cosey's ongoing romance imploded, and Chris and Cosey's lifelong partnership began). But the standout solo track is surely Chris Carter's celestial arpeggio staircase <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYDtObWGEGk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""AB/7A""</a>, a clear influence upon the now-much-imitated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a> aesthetic of heart-tugging synth mandalas.</p>
<p>Counterbalancing these solitary excursions, the group efforts on this album are exhilaratingly bleak: From the chemtrails of distortion on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8riZnope7Ak"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hit By a Rock""</a> to the amplified sound of early computer code stored on cassette on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIPPcPzbOcI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I.B.M.""</a> to the final raveup of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfatCsJqa6Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Blood on the Floor""</a>, it's never less than car-crash fascinating. At the center of the record is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPrTUC7BDn4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hamburger Lady""</a>, a nightmarish vision of a burn victim's excruciatingly prolonged survival in the administered world of a high-tech hospital. It's probably Throbbing Gristle's greatest song, and it sounds tougher and more menacing than ever. The re-mastering has put a bass-jeep-worthy oomph into the low end of the kick drum, thickened the seasick, doomy bass dirge that, yes, throbs at its heart, and sharpened the edge of the scything central riff, a party horn run through a custom-built effects unit called the Gristleizer. Witch-house wishes it were this creepy, but even upside-down crosses won't save you from the horror of everyday life. A nauseating masterpiece, and an essential recording.</p>
<p><i><b>20 JAZZ FUNK GREATS</b></i></p>
<p>You could write an entire book about the sly wit and polymorphous slipperiness of <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>, whose kitsch seaside holiday photo on notorious suicide spot Beachy Head tips off the viewer to the deliberately fishy insincerity of its sonic contents. In a smash and grab that testifies to both increased musical ambition and a relentless urge to wrongfoot audience expectations, <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i> finds the band waking up from <i>D.O.A</i>'s dark night of the soul and feeling curiously frisky. Snacking on not only the titular funk and jazz, the band also takes touristic zig zags through exotica, rock, and disco. Like the alien mimic in John Carpenter's sci-fi horror film ""The Thing"", each song seems almost persuasive as a stab at these genres, but crucially twists itself out of alignment in a perverse reveal.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqnVneEBpgQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hot on the Heels of Love""</a> is a delirious slice of Moroder-esque boudoir-disco complete with breathy vocals from Cosey and, thanks to the remastering, a floor-filling low-end thump. The blueprint for 100% Silk's hipster-house shenanigans arguably starts here, with people who have no business taking over the dancefloor doing it anyway, with surprisingly solid results. An even stronger case for the critical re-thinking that mastering can achieve, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u0WBQhVAgA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Convincing People""</a>, which has previously struck me as a less-than-successful stab at a cynically collapsed political anthem, now sounds suitably fist-pumping. But the standout moment here is still <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCfqt74Jru8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Persuasion""</a>. Handcuffed to a plodding, two-note bass figure, Gen croons a narrative of pornographic photography sessions, which is punctured by squealing shards of Cosey's guitar and deeply unnerving tapes of unidentifiable people in compromising situations that seem to mingle distress, ecstasy, and pain. Tilting a repellent and yet seductive purr against found audio fragments, it's as if the crew of ""To Catch a Predator"" arrived too late to stop the Drake of ""Marvins Room"" from making a snuff film: once encountered, you can't hit undo.</p>
<p>But as much as TG tried to deliberately ""guarantee disappointment"" and mutate away from any signature, certain gestures had started to recur: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BXb6XoPkkA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Six Six Sixties""</a> ends this album in the riff rock grind-mode just as ""Blood on the Floor"" ended <i>D.O.A.</i> Patterns had begun to emerge, and the cumulative pressure of their own survival now forces the band members to work harder to surprise themselves. It's in the pathos of their promiscuous liasons with the forbidden territory of various forms of ""real music"" that this album generates a weirdly gripping power of its own. I am biased and perhaps lonely here, but this fussy midget regards it as their peak.</p>
<p><i><b>HEATHEN EARTH</b></i></p>
<p>A live-in-the-studio séance recorded in one take in front of a posse of friends and associates, I've always regarded <i>Heathen Earth</i> as the dog in the manger, sounding slightly stiff relative to the unhinged and abrasive live sound captured on the <i>TG24</i> boxset, which archives their scalding live gigs before frequently hostile crowds with less fidelity but more heart. The opening salvos of this concert draw upon songs and rhythmic tapes already deployed on <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>, and they sound tentative, fragmentary, slightly inhibited. But things begin to erupt when the whistling-led mirage of ""The World Is a War Film"" dissolves into a ripping version of ""Something Came Over Me"", turning that single into a propulsive, masturbatory launchpad for a swirling noise-dub overload which Carter's remastering has pumped into startling new prominence. Gen holds back from taking much of a vocal frontman position, and the result is a greater awareness of TG's ear for texture. It would take a spicerack of adjectives to do justice to the gnarled, twisted, flanged, and serrated soundworld conjured by the band's unique gear and more-is-more approach to processing. But it's a testimony to their precision that, for all their influence, nobody quite sounds like them when they are truly on blast, as they are here. Things come to a suitably frenzied peak in the stomping, cornet-led ""Don't Do as You're Told, Do as You Think"", in which Cosey's horn-through delay finally makes good on the clammy flirtations with jazz from <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>. Having promised a séance on a rainy afternoon, a relaxation technique cassette concludes the jam.</p>
<p><i><b>GREATEST HITS</b></i></p>
<p>Though they are taking the piss in passing themselves off as band who had ""hits,"" this compilation from 1980 of 7"" singles and assertive album tracks in fact does the trick nicely: It makes a first-rate introduction to the band and offers a less torturous entryway to their prickly, poisonous oeuvre than any particular album. The swells of ""Hamburger Lady"" start us off feeling nausea, and this bumpy ride builds in force from there. You can sense in this victory lap a kind of précis of their career arc that testifies to the strange tractor-beam effect of pop values on an experimental band. The single element from <i>Second Annual Report</i> is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9S5Y8nzz40"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tiab Guls""</a>, a backward version of ""Slug Bait"" that effectively censors the bloody lyrics by upstaging them into a blur. The perkiest and most uptempo high points of <i>D.O.A.</i> and <i>20 Jazz</i> dominate, and the cover, a pastiche of Arthur Lyman and Martin Denny exotica sleeves, tips its hats to the cover of <i>20 Jazz</i> as well. But the real peaks are the spiky singles <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_mKDKKySls"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""United""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgy64431FgA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Adrenalin""</a>, fantastically complete exercises in minimalistic synth-pop songwriting that imply an alternative universe in which Throbbing Gristle were just a fuzzier, more dyspeptic cousin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24311-john-foxx/"" target=""_blank"">John Foxx</a>.</p>
<p>I wish there were a hidden TG album with 20 more songs like these, and it just so happens that the bonus tracks on this CD are the most intriguing and fully formed, including alternative mixes of ""AB/7A"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf9KX6BI408"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Old Man Smiled""</a>. It is this full-speed-ahead electronic pop aspect of TG's lineage that aligns these pioneers of industrial music with the minimal synth, cold wave, and proto-techno revivalists of today. TG were crucial early pioneers of an aesthetic that now cuts a broad swathe across the audio landscape, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29479-martial-canterel/"" target=""_blank"">Martial Canterel</a>, the <a href=""http://wierdrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wierd Records</a> posse, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave/"" target=""_blank"">Cold Cave</a>, through to, arguably, lots of recent pop and R&amp;B production, where icy synths and stark drum patterns undergird alienated vocals ad infinitum.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's an unintended irony that a band so hostile to the very idea of ""music"" as such should have created recordings that have become enshrined into canonical constellations, but TG's influence has spiraled outwards as a direct result of their very unreliability and deviance. Thanks to the weird range and high quality of their catalog, separate strands of Throbbing Gristle's DNA are now entwined within the histories of electronic music, techno, dance music, goth aesthetics, occult subcultures, the avant edge of indie rock, and the entirety of the noise underground. It's a capitalist fairtytale born of hipster hindsight: The people who tried as hard as possible to make their audiences uncomfortable turned out to have a little bit of something for everyone.</p>
<p>In the wake of Sleazy's startling death in 2010, a kind of melancholic asymmetry has settled into place: the archive as mausoleum. The band can no longer re-unite and tour, though rumors and speculation continue to circulate about the ultimate fate of the extended recording sessions that the band tracked in London at the ICA for an extended deconstructive cover of the entirety of Nico's <i>Desertshore</i> album. In the wake of the decline of the CD and the seemingly inevitable slide downward in fidelity as the new brigade of information hunter-gatherers settle for the lossy, filed-shared free-for-all of torrents over the material culture of collectables, it's a perhaps deliberately out-of-step gesture to decide at precisely this point to remaster, repackage, and represent these Mosaic tablets of noise into upscale commodities memorializing a vanished moment of rebellion. So much for laughing in the face of historians, collectors, and revivalists.</p>
<p>Having the last laugh while seemingly anticipating this bittersweet outcome, Throbbing Gristle still don't add up: These albums are perversely inconclusive, by turns drably ugly and beautifully vital. However much Chris Carter has clarified their sound and stabilized their canon, the work itself remains as profoundly self-differential as ever. To cite a phrase the band used for its LP of the cut-ups of their icon and friend William S. Burroughs, there is ""Nothing here now but the recordings."" But those recordings have a funny way of coming to life. In 1981 in the <i>NME</i>, Paul Morley prophesized that ""one day TG's music will sound rich and sweet."" Thanks to Chris Carter's remastering and the necromancy of Industrial Records, that day has arrived.</p></div>"|16108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16108-throbbing-gristle/|8.0|Drew Daniel

So wrote Claude Bessy in the liner notes to <i>Throbbing Gristle's Greatest Hits</i>, one of the five classic <a href=""http://www.throbbing-gristle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Throbbing Gristle</a> albums Industrial Records have just reissued, and which now sit upon my desk, uncanny and accusatory, over 30 years after that pre-emptive fit of snark. Throbbing Gristle were never meant to be reliable, but here they come again, ready to be harvested by the very culture industry they alternately solicited and spat upon so long ago.</p>
<p>Permit me to adjust my obscene hairdo and offer those of you not already in the know some history: In their first incarnation as the Death Factory, they were the house band for Coum Transmissions, an abject performance-art troupe whose presentation of used tampons, anal syringes, and pornography featuring band member Cosey Fanny Tutti in the ICA gallery for their ""Prostitution"" show in 1976 earned them tabloid infamy and denunciations in Parliament as ""wreckers of civilization."" So far, so punk. But the music of the Death Factory, soon re-named Throbbing Gristle after a Yorkshire slang term for an erection, was a horse of a different color: ""industrial music for industrial people,"" a dystopian, negative form of what the band itself called ""post-psychedelic trash.""</p>
<p>While the rest of the Class of '77 pogoed steadily, Throbbing Gristle blew hot and cold, a passive-aggressive tug of war between the sharp and the slimy: The formal elegance of Chris Carter's synthesizers are scrawled upon by Genesis P-Orridge's bass riffs and Cosey Fanni Tutti's fuzz guitar freakouts, spiced with violin and dubby honks of cornet. This already pungent stew is spiked with taped material selected by Peter ""Sleazy"" Christopherson-- excerpts of everyday intimacy and true crime verité-- and the arsenic tang of Genesis' vocals, either sung in a soft sort of sprechstimme or howled into effects. On their debut, <i>The Second Annual Report</i>, the music alternately chugged along like a squelchy, crude cop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>, or stretched out into malingering new age, like a syphilitic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Tangerine Dream</a>. But they got both more virulent and more ambitious with time, upping the hostility and dread on <i>D.O.A</i>, taking a kitsch detour toward mutant disco on <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>, auto-cannibalizing their catalog in the live-in-the-studio ritual recording of <i>Heathen Earth</i>, and reasserting a strangely forceful collection of avant garde anti-pop for a <i>Greatest Hits</i> package revealingly subtitled <i>Entertainment Through Pain</i>, which collates their singles output as a quiver of tense stabs at accessibility.</p>
<p>In time for Christmas, a revived Industrial Records has just re-released all five of these classic albums, lovingly repackaged in deluxe gatefolded 2xCD editions. In each case, the original album is (wisely) preserved intact on one CD, while a second CD collects period singles, live performances, and a smattering of alternate mixes and unreleased material. Artwork is supplemented with alternate takes from photo-sessions, and it's a jarring experience for collector scum like myself to see and hear these goofy blooper reels and deleted scenes, in which the avatars of colder-than-thou aesthetics stand on one foot or giggle. Savvily recognizing the waning moment of the CD as such, there are vinyl editions of the albums too, which faithfully reprint the original artwork at full size and format. While so far I've only checked out the vinyl for <i>20 Jazz</i>, it looks drool-worthy and sounds far stronger than any other pressing that this fussy midget has encountered.</p>
<p>Given that these albums have stayed continuously in print for years through arrangements with Fetish Records, and later Mute, one must ask: Why bother paying attention to these reissues? In a triumphant vindication of sound over image, the real motivation for this re-presentation of a back catalog is that all five of these five albums have been remastered by Chris Carter himself, a labor of obsessive-compulsive love whose consequences I intend to unpack, album-by-album, below. On the face of it, the idea of an ""audiophile TG"" makes for a jarring proposition: The band always seemed weirdly proud of the dismal fidelity of its early recordings, and its stated objective was to be repellent and un-assimilable. As an early Coum Transmisions slogan put it, ""We Guarantee Disappointment."" However off-message, the immersive experience of these new versions redeems what might sound gratuitous, or merely greedy, about this gambit. It's the audio equivalent of a ""director's cut"" edition of a beloved series of seedy cult movies, something to file between your Kenneth Anger boxset and a Hermann Nitsch coffee-table tome.</p>
<p>Assessed as an archival work of restoration, it's a bullseye. I've been listening to these records for 25 years, and for me, this feels like the cleaning of the Sistine Chapel, if the Sistine Chapel were painted by Hieronymous Bosch instead of Michelangelo. Simply put, the heat and noise and grit and dirt and gristle is still there, but Chris Carter has finally put meat on the bones. There's simply more vitality and physicality to the music, and yet it still sounds ""very TG"": The harsh, brittle, and scalpel-sharp high end is preserved, but the kick drums are heavier, the riffs hit harder, and the field recordings now produce a tactile IMAX-theater immersion effect. But going beyond these side effects of possibly overheated fanboy devotion, the re-introduction of Throbbing Gristle into the cultural bloodstream also offers up a temperature-taking opportunity to assess both the entire arc of their career and the harder question of whom it might speak to today.</p>

Tilting a repellent and yet seductive purr against found audio fragments, it's as if the crew of ""To Catch a Predator"" arrived too late to stop the Drake of ""Marvins Room"" from making a snuff film: once encountered, you can't hit undo.</p>
<p>But as much as TG tried to deliberately ""guarantee disappointment"" and mutate away from any signature, certain gestures had started to recur: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BXb6XoPkkA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Six Six Sixties""</a> ends this album in the riff rock grind-mode just as ""Blood on the Floor"" ended <i>D.O.A.</i> Patterns had begun to emerge, and the cumulative pressure of their own survival now forces the band members to work harder to surprise themselves. It's in the pathos of their promiscuous liasons with the forbidden territory of various forms of ""real music"" that this album generates a weirdly gripping power of its own. I am biased and perhaps lonely here, but this fussy midget regards it as their peak.</p>
<p><i><b>HEATHEN EARTH</b></i></p>
<p>A live-in-the-studio séance recorded in one take in front of a posse of friends and associates, I've always regarded <i>Heathen Earth</i> as the dog in the manger, sounding slightly stiff relative to the unhinged and abrasive live sound captured on the <i>TG24</i> boxset, which archives their scalding live gigs before frequently hostile crowds with less fidelity but more heart. The opening salvos of this concert draw upon songs and rhythmic tapes already deployed on <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>, and they sound tentative, fragmentary, slightly inhibited. But things begin to erupt when the whistling-led mirage of ""The World Is a War Film"" dissolves into a ripping version of ""Something Came Over Me"", turning that single into a propulsive, masturbatory launchpad for a swirling noise-dub overload which Carter's remastering has pumped into startling new prominence. Gen holds back from taking much of a vocal frontman position, and the result is a greater awareness of TG's ear for texture. It would take a spicerack of adjectives to do justice to the gnarled, twisted, flanged, and serrated soundworld conjured by the band's unique gear and more-is-more approach to processing. But it's a testimony to their precision that, for all their influence, nobody quite sounds like them when they are truly on blast, as they are here. Things come to a suitably frenzied peak in the stomping, cornet-led ""Don't Do as You're Told, Do as You Think"", in which Cosey's horn-through delay finally makes good on the clammy flirtations with jazz from <i>20 Jazz Funk Greats</i>. Having promised a séance on a rainy afternoon, a relaxation technique cassette concludes the jam.</p>
<p><i><b>GREATEST HITS</b></i></p>
<p>Though they are taking the piss in passing themselves off as band who had ""hits,"" this compilation from 1980 of 7"" singles and assertive album tracks in fact does the trick nicely: It makes a first-rate introduction to the band and offers a less torturous entryway to their prickly, poisonous oeuvre than any particular album. The swells of ""Hamburger Lady"" start us off feeling nausea, and this bumpy ride builds in force from there. You can sense in this victory lap a kind of précis of their career arc that testifies to the strange tractor-beam effect of pop values on an experimental band. The single element from <i>Second Annual Report</i> is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9S5Y8nzz40"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tiab Guls""</a>, a backward version of ""Slug Bait"" that effectively censors the bloody lyrics by upstaging them into a blur. The perkiest and most uptempo high points of <i>D.O.A.</i> and <i>20 Jazz</i> dominate, and the cover, a pastiche of Arthur Lyman and Martin Denny exotica sleeves, tips its hats to the cover of <i>20 Jazz</i> as well. But the real peaks are the spiky singles <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_mKDKKySls"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""United""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgy64431FgA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Adrenalin""</a>, fantastically complete exercises in minimalistic synth-pop songwriting that imply an alternative universe in which Throbbing Gristle were just a fuzzier, more dyspeptic cousin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24311-john-foxx/"" target=""_blank"">John Foxx</a>.</p>
<p>I wish there were a hidden TG album with 20 more songs like these, and it just so happens that the bonus tracks on this CD are the most intriguing and fully formed, including alternative mixes of ""AB/7A"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf9KX6BI408"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Old Man Smiled""</a>. It is this full-speed-ahead electronic pop aspect of TG's lineage that aligns these pioneers of industrial music with the minimal synth, cold wave, and proto-techno revivalists of today. TG were crucial early pioneers of an aesthetic that now cuts a broad swathe across the audio landscape, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29479-martial-canterel/"" target=""_blank"">Martial Canterel</a>, the <a href=""http://wierdrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wierd Records</a> posse, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave/"" target=""_blank"">Cold Cave</a>, through to, arguably, lots of recent pop and R&amp;B production, where icy synths and stark drum patterns undergird alienated vocals ad infinitum.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's an unintended irony that a band so hostile to the very idea of ""music"" as such should have created recordings that have become enshrined into canonical constellations, but TG's influence has spiraled outwards as a direct result of their very unreliability and deviance. Thanks to the weird range and high quality of their catalog, separate strands of Throbbing Gristle's DNA are now entwined within the histories of electronic music, techno, dance music, goth aesthetics, occult subcultures, the avant edge of indie rock, and the entirety of the noise underground. It's a capitalist fairtytale born of hipster hindsight: The people who tried as hard as possible to make their audiences uncomfortable turned out to have a little bit of something for everyone.</p>
<p>In the wake of Sleazy's startling death in 2010, a kind of melancholic asymmetry has settled into place: the archive as mausoleum. The band can no longer re-unite and tour, though rumors and speculation continue to circulate about the ultimate fate of the extended recording sessions that the band tracked in London at the ICA for an extended deconstructive cover of the entirety of Nico's <i>Desertshore</i> album. In the wake of the decline of the CD and the seemingly inevitable slide downward in fidelity as the new brigade of information hunter-gatherers settle for the lossy, filed-shared free-for-all of torrents over the material culture of collectables, it's a perhaps deliberately out-of-step gesture to decide at precisely this point to remaster, repackage, and represent these Mosaic tablets of noise into upscale commodities memorializing a vanished moment of rebellion. So much for laughing in the face of historians, collectors, and revivalists.</p>
<p>Having the last laugh while seemingly anticipating this bittersweet outcome, Throbbing Gristle still don't add up: These albums are perversely inconclusive, by turns drably ugly and beautifully vital. However much Chris Carter has clarified their sound and stabilized their canon, the work itself remains as profoundly self-differential as ever. To cite a phrase the band used for its LP of the cut-ups of their icon and friend William S. Burroughs, there is ""Nothing here now but the recordings."" But those recordings have a funny way of coming to life. In 1981 in the <i>NME</i>, Paul Morley prophesized that ""one day TG's music will sound rich and sweet."" Thanks to Chris Carter's remastering and the necromancy of Industrial Records, that day has arrived.</p></div>"|16108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16108-throbbing-gristle/|9.0|Drew Daniel

She's been acting since she was 13, and the first glimmers of her parallel musical career date to the same year, when she dueted with her father, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4810-serge-gainsbourg/"" target=""_blank"">Serge Gainsbourg</a>, on a song called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE06lqT0Y2g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lemon Incest""</a>. He produced her first album two years later, in 1986, but she left music alone for more than a decade after that, and didn't pick up her solo career again until 2006. I don't know the reasons for the long pause, but I do think that waiting so long to restart her singing career allowed her to create distance between her own identity as a performer and an identity guided by her father. In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/35-air/"" target=""_blank"">Air</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4769-jarvis-cocker/"" target=""_blank"">Jarvis Cocker</a>, and more recently, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a>, she found collaborators who could pitch material perfectly for her-- she doesn't project a huge personality on her records, but she sounds at home in the paleofuturistic musical worlds of her albums, calmly detailing airplane crashes, medical procedures, and a long catalog of ruminations on mortality.</p>
<p>Gainsbourg had her third child earlier this year, which makes the time ripe for a gap-filling release of some sort, and <i>Stage Whisper</i> fills that bill, splitting itself between live recordings of songs from her two most recent LPs,<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13878-irm/"" target=""_blank"">IRM</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9407-555/"" target=""_blank"">5:55</a></i>, and unreleased studio tracks. Both sections of the record pick up the thread Gainsbourg began unraveling with Beck on <i>IRM</i>. The songs from that album are put forth in all their buzzy glory, with the emphasis on the most kinetic tracks: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11562-irm/"" target=""_blank"">""IRM""</a>, ""Trick Pony"", and ""Voyage"" are all among the highlights.</p>
<p>The relatively smooth edges of the <i>5:55</i> material are hammered a little rougher by her touring band. The Cocker-penned ""Set Yourself on Fire"" sounds great with a generous helping of fuzz guitar muddying the hook. Gainsbourg's ability to blend into her audio environments is usually an asset on her albums, but on the live recordings it means she doesn't really command the spotlight-- the performance is fine, but there aren't any revelations in her on-stage readings of the material. As if to emphasize the point, the worst thing here is easily the sleepy cover of Dylan's ""Just Like a Woman"", which seems to rest entirely on the premise of a gender switch by the singer, a switch that's not compelling on its own. The new energy heard in some of these songs comes from the revamped arrangements, and listening to the live songs is essentially the same as listening to studio recordings-- the presence of an audience doesn't seem to change her performance dynamic.</p>
<p>The new studio material mostly builds directly on <i>IRM</i>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16279-terrible-angels/"" target=""_blank"">""Terrible Angels""</a>, produced by Beck, is a buzzing, fizzy concoction not far outside the realm of what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"" target=""_blank"">Broadcast</a> were doing prior to the death of Trish Keenan, though it's not as unstable. It has that same effect of sounding like the past and the future at once, though. Gainsbourg has the perfect cold, even vocal tone for electro-pop, and a few of these songs go there. ""All the Rain"" is a nice cousin to ""Trick Pony"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12821-paradisco/"" target=""_blank"">""Paradisco""</a> makes good use of her soft voice against a hard beat. On the whole, <i>Stage Whisper</i> is enjoyable, but the live portion is dispensible, and the new studio tracks, which will likely please anyone taken with <i>IRM</i>, are the real draw.</p></div>"|16094.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16094-stage-whisper/|6.8|Joe Tangari

But over the past two years, the English label has placed just as much stock into warmed-over and vaguely nostalgic sounds, riffing off of chillwave and hypnagogic pop but dressing it all up in beat-oriented structures compatible with the UK bass dialogue that Planet Mu otherwise engages with. Artists like Boxcutter, Solar Bears, Oriol, Tropics, and even FaltyDL have all swum down this lukewarm stream of lazy watercolor, and the label ends one of its best years ever with its first release by Greek duo <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/keepshellyinathens"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Keep Shelly in Athens</a>.</p>
<p>Making their first appearance on Mu with a remix of fellow dream-popper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28970-tropics/"" target=""_blank"">Tropics</a>, the lead track off of their first solo EP is also a remix. If this move seems a little disingenuous at first-- is their own material just not up to snuff?-- it's easy to understand why once you actually play the thing. Solar Bears' original <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTB8W3xA2Ww"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cub""</a> was one of their album's more wandering pieces, three minutes of spidery guitar and mellotron, vaguely medieval in its execution. But <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15459-cub-keep-shelly-in-athens-remix/"" target=""_blank"">in Keep Shelly in Athens' hands</a>, it's an achingly poignant quiet-stormer. Unravelling and pitch-bending that guitar riff to queasy extremes, the duo pushes a staggered beat underneath it, along with its usual assortment of wafting vocal samples. Once the drop hits, it pushes forward with a surprising momentum: Spiraling down a vortex of intense color, ""Cub"" is a misty rush of twinkling synths and adult-contemporary vocals molded into wordless but heart-tugging shapes.</p>
<p>It's a hell of an introduction, and it sets up the band for high expectations on their original material. They deliver as well as anyone could expect such a young band to: ""The Chains"" throws a foundation of rolling basslines and taut percussive loops underneath frontwoman Sarah P's soft vocals, and suddenly bursts into a clangorous, banging echo chamber where drums ominously beat in a pseudo-dubstep pattern. It's a tantalizing 20 seconds that never gets less startling or less powerful, and the duo throws those lurching beats all over ""Struggle With Yourself"", where Sarah P's vocals merge with the humid and cloudy backdrop, and the drums glitch, catch, and screech rudely underneath. The surprisingly nasty underbelly keeps the otherwise lightweight songs from floating away completely, and offers a tangible undercurrent separating them from a legion of anodyne dream-pop acts all singing the same pleasantly slurred tune.</p>
<p>The EP's only uncertain moment comes with its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12790-campus-martius/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>, which pairs an awfully saccharine piano motif over erratically sliced percussion, a tension between the beautiful and the berserk that recalls Kuedo's majestic <i>Severant</i> only without the careful balance of melodrama and grit. But even here, vocals gently ride the beat with a supple propulsion that, just like on their remix of ""Cub"", proves addictive and persuasive without predictability. They're still dealing with the unassembled spare parts of what sounds like could be a tight, confident outfit, but the configurations they try on here are promising and at the least intriguing. They might not have answered the question of what exactly separates them from the bleary-eyed masses, but considering the caliber of the artists they're now mingling with on Planet Mu, the possibility for nurturing artistic growth seems high. One's thing for sure: They do one hell of a remix.</p></div>"|16099.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16099-campus-martius/|6.9|Andrew Ryce

A trio, rounded out by drummer Jeremy Villalobos and, later, Roy Tatum, Wives emphasized passion over precision. The band took its basic inspiration from 1980s hardcore bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30017-void/"" target=""_blank"">Void</a>, but amped up the freak-out factor with explosive bursts of noise and out-crowd abstraction. Formed in 2001, they delivered a handful of 7"" singles and the <i>Erect the Youth Problem</i> LP before Spunt and Randall laid the name to rest. You can still catch a clip of their final gig, performed as a duo, on the 2006 documentary <i><a href=""http://40bands80minutes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">40 Bands/80 Minutes</a></i>.</p>
<p>Released to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Spunt's label, PPM, <i>The Roy Tapes</i> are Wives' last gasp, seven songs recorded immediately prior to the band's first and final European tour, then shelved for nearly seven years. As lost albums go, it's not quite <i>Smile</i> or <i>Black Album</i>-grade myth-fodder. It's a slight, unlabored collection of tunes-- 10 minutes of shrill feedback and growl, preserving the last handful of tunes the band wrote, plus one Negative Approach cover (""Can't Tell No One""). If you caught them in 2005, it will set off an immediate, tender pang of nostalgia.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But there's historical value, too-- if only because you can hear the early percolation of the ideas that would drive No Age. On <i>The Roy Tapes</i>, Spunt and Randall's songwriting takes a step back from the abstract and brainy turf that Wives staked out on their debut. The songs are clumsier in execution, but more hummable. Instead of a tool to voice agression and anger, noise becomes a more melodic and textural element, playful instead of pumelling. On ""If You Went Any Lower You'd Hit China"", the trio rides a simple singsong guitar hook through a wave of electronic squealing, tumbling into a primitive rave up.</p>
<p><i>The Roy Tapes</i> isn't Wives' finest hour-- <i>Erect the Youth Problem</i> is a more fully realized effort and, if you keep an eye out, it's not that hard to find it in the cut-out bin-- but it's an admirable testament to Spunt and Randall's stick-to-it-iveness at a time when their band was very much in flux. In No Age, Randall and Spunt would hit on a brand of positive punk that was explosive and emotionally direct, but never tear-streaked or tedious. If nothing else, Wives were the first step toward bigger things.</p></div>"|16101.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16101-wives-the-roy-tapes/|6.7|Aaron Leitko

The ""office"" in that scenario was the Corduroy Records vinyl pressing plant in Australia. The story's captured on their first song, 2003's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhPBCbxW1kY&amp;noredirect=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""So Many Things""</a>, a track with ragged, propulsive energy; a juvenile sense of humor; sloppy vocals; and a loud, meandering organ. It sounds like the sort of in-the-moment jam that could pop up at any work party-- people have clearly been drinking; the lyrics are frontman Brendan Suppression's bitter rambling about a woman: ""I think about you here and there/ Only because you're a dickhead"" and ""I don't need your boobies/ I don't need your cute little bum."" It's a rough artifact of their first foray in making music. It's also the opening track on the band's new Goner-imprinted singles compilation, which naturally teases out ECSR's chronological trajectory through B-sides and singles.</p>
<p>Since <i>So Many Things</i> shows the group from its inception to the present, it's safe to assume it illustrates some sort of growth. A quick comparison between tracks one and 22 suggest that's probably the case: 2010's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdWixkUlWv8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rush to Relax""</a> has markedly better production and displays a bit more patience and maturity in the band. And, throughout the collection, you can hear a more well-defined guitar sound from Eddy Current and more assertive vocals from Suppression. But they never stop having fun-- their sloppy cover of the Go-Go's ""We Got the Beat"" from a 2011 Record Store Day split 7"" on Trouble in Mind proves that. The band sounds reckless in their approach, singing completely off beat (pun probably intended), like they're having just as much fun as they were at the 2003 Corduroy Christmas party. That's probably the best thing about <i>So Many Things</i>-- it's a document of four dudes having a good time over the course of about six years.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not all drunken staggering through silly jams-- there's plenty of ripping punk and reasonably weighty stuff here. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs9tm5esFY8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Let Me Be Honest With You""</a>, from their 2008 LP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13667-eddy-current-suppression-ring-primary-colours/"" target=""_blank"">Primary Colours</a></i>, has a two-guitar barrage, undercut by Suppression's monotonous vocals. In several songs-- especially ""Honest"" and ""It Ain't Cheap""-- his voice sounds a lot like Iggy Pop's on early Stooges records. They've got a cover of ""T.A.L.O.I.G.A."" by Australian punks the Chosen Few, which has Current attacking a dissonant, screaming guitar solo. Then there's ""Iraq (It's on the Map)"", driven by a militaristic snare and that states, matter-of-factly, ""people are dying from west to east."" Their bass gets guttural and their guitars get frantic on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXJzPQsuljg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Demon's Demands""</a>.</p>
<p>They do menace well, something that probably comes from the band's obsession with punk. (Also, drummer Danny Current used to be in a grindcore band called Demonother.) But even when they crank up the distortion, they don't stray too far from their biggest strength-- these guys really are a lot of fun. ""Hey Mum"" is especially awesome-- a two-minute, jumpy, hokey Hallmark card to a mother. The best part about it? It's still a damn fine punk song. Their growth is most apparent, though, in their musicianship. Even on the shortest song of the bunch, ""Through the Trees"", there's subtle, intricate guitar work from Current that weaves between a harmony line and staying in unison with Suppression's vocals. Sure, Eddy Current Suppression Ring are still the goofy drunks from the record plant, but as musicians, they're capable of elegant, well done rock'n'roll.</p></div>"|16106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16106-eddy-current-suppression-ring-so-many-things/|7.4|Evan Minsker

That he's a criminal who got caught up in the familiar street-hustle trappings that the modern media's documented countless times is a pivotal detail-- it's hit at an angle that seems to emphasize the futile inevitability of it all. His life could be any number of misdirected narratives that ends with a toe tag, and what details listeners learn about him are hazy, buried under archetypal turns of fate and decisive struggles. That this protagonist is a fictionalized composite of a handful of real people, filtered through a matter-of-fact narrative that splits character ambivalence with journalistic impartiality, only makes his lack of direction and the failure of any real closure stand out even more. ""Lotta niggas go to prison,"" Dice Raw states on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44573-video-the-roots-tip-the-scale/"" target=""_blank"">""Tip the Scale""</a>, ""how many come out Malcolm X?""</p>
<p>So <a href=""http://theroots.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Roots</a>' latest album isn't a sprawling, rise-and-fall crime story, not a condemnation or a veneration of a man living outside the law, not a bullet-riddled <i>grand guignol</i> heavy on explicit details of soldiers getting cut down. It's a character study of a man whose existential crisis ends only with his death-- a death gone largely unspecified, the glamor and tragedy washed over with a doomed resignation. That's a hard thing to pull off, even for a band as given to deep-thinking concepts as the Roots are. And when your main lyrical catalyst is Black Thought-- a man more given to allusions than direct statements-- it's likely that it'll take a while for the full scope of <i>Undun</i> to really sink in.</p>
<p>If and when it does, it might strike listeners as a bit skeletal: omit the mood-setting instrumental bookends, including a brief, four-part orchestral suite that builds off Sufjan Stevens' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUlIvXCj7tA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Redford (For Yia-Yia and Pappou)""</a>, and you've got maybe a half hour's worth of material. By ?uestlove's accounts, writing Redford's story introduced the headaches and challenges that come with scriptwriting into their songwriting, and what's left on <i>Undun</i> is the end result of frequent revisions and rewrites that attempt to reconcile character, theme, and continuity. If it comes at the expense of nuance, it's not always obvious: There's an easy-to-trace narrative line from Redford's acceptance of his fate (""Sleep"") to his acknowledgement of how close it's approaching (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12619-make-my-ft-big-krit/"" target=""_blank"">""Make My""</a>), back through declarations of aggravated toughness (""One Time""), and celebratory fatalism (""Kool On""), along ups and downs that juxtapose motivation (""Stomp"") and helplessness (""Lighthouse""). When the vocal portion of the album ends with two of the bleakest sets of verses in the Roots discography, peaking with the estrangement of ""I Remember"" and the desperation of ""Tip the Scale"", <i>Undun</i> reveals itself as a story where a man's actual death isn't quite as tragic as the circumstances that pushed him to it.</p>
<p>The catch is that the inevitable familiarity of this storyline, even in the service of a deep emotional study, is almost an end in itself-- a cycle seen far too often, played out in terms anyone who's ever been or known someone with their back against the wall can understand. And if <i>Undun</i> succeeds at putting one man's criminal-world struggle with free will and fate in empathetic terms, it does so at the expense of any unique details or unusual traits that would set him apart-- Redford is humanized, but he's not entirely individualized. If you've bought an Apple device in the last couple of years, you can download a free app that includes some world-building video clips and photos that give him more of a full-life context. If you're still relying on a Blackberry and a clickwheel iPod, you're left with the voices of Black Thought, Dice Raw, and the now-more-googleable Greg Porn to fill in most of the blanks. They're admirable technicians and can be charismatic on their own terms, but voicing raw emotion isn't a major strength for any of them.</p>
<p>What you do get is a heightened sense of perplexed frustration, and there are times when Black Thought actually hits another level in his lyrics to meet it. A resilient, on-the-grind turn of phrase like ""I'm never sleeping like I'm on methamphtamines/ Move like my enemy 10 steps ahead of me"" (""Kool On"") is delivered with the same emphasis as a bitter, regretful line like ""I'll leave the memories here, I won't need them/ If I stop thinking and lie, now that's freedom"" (""Lighthouse""). But if that's one of the reasons <i>Undun</i> feels almost relentless in its singleminded dejection, it's also proof that, if Black Thought can't always push through a sentiment with his voice, he can at least deliver the fuck out of an idea.</p>
<p>The other MCs in the Roots' core provide some welcome shifts in tone: Greg Porn's nasal drone often slips into bluntly nihilistic imagery (""Put the knife in ya back cut down to the red meat/ Daddy should've let me be a stain on the bed sheets""), and Dice Raw's rapper/singer double-threat role continues to provide a heart of much-needed pathos. His closing line on ""One Time"" might be the most pitch-perfect moment of film noir cynicism on the album: ""To make it to the bottom, such a high climb."" When Phonte and Big K.R.I.T. deliver guest verses that still feel like relative afterthoughts, it's a bit disappointing, but they come strong enough to keep the album's fated, introspective mood consistent.</p>
<p>There's one other aspect to <i>Undun</i> that gives it a sense of ambivalence, even if it's a minor and comparative one: The music itself feels less immediate. After <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14386-how-i-got-over/"" target=""_blank"">How I Got Over</a></i> channeled frustrated, brooding soul toward a gradual expansion into triumphant liveliness, the limited palette of down-to-mid-tempo dirges here feels almost stiflingly gloomy. Which means it works-- if this album is a cinematic experience, the score here fills in the cues for moods that the MCs mostly just suggest. The drums-and-keys structure feels more delicate and less urgent than the Roots' best meditative moments, and what few tracks there are with some kick to them-- the burbly guitar-driven ""Kool On"", the worried funk of ""Lighthouse""-- have more of a pull in their chorus than anything in the instrumentation does. Yet the cumulative effect of all that mournful weight is effective enough in the story's service. And in the run-up to ""Tip the Scale"", a string-accented elegy loosely reminiscent of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJCHeEQV454"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Got Me""</a>, the idea comes across that any glimmer of optimism in this album would be beside the point. This isn't the Roots' most accessible album, and it's definitely their most downbeat, but it comes from a place that isn't always easy to dwell.</p></div>"|16102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16102-the-roots-undun/|7.3|Nate Patrin

While any collaboration between electronic producer <a href=""http://www.fennesz.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Christian Fennesz</a> and composer <a href=""http://www.sitesakamoto.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a> has always veered safely into minimal territory, this is easily their most ascetic thing yet; across two discs and two hours, it maintains an almost religious focus on the subtle, slyly shifting interplay between Sakamoto's wandering piano melodies and Fennesz's woolly atmospherics, never peaking or troughing in any dramatic or otherwise notable fashion, and in fact never moving too far from the style and sensibility that it establishes in its very first minutes. Whether you consider this discipline or laziness might depend entirely on how long you listen for, and how.</p>
<p>As with all of their collaborations-- as well as a lot of their individual efforts-- the emphasis here is on subtle shifts and interplays, and the rewards therein. <i>Flumina</i> spends the vast majority of its two hours vacillating between holy moments of harmony and others that are subsumed by an undercurrent of atonality and portent. If I were to try to illustrate the pattern by which Sakamoto's cascading piano notes and Fennesz's pulsing and gauzy guitar lines swarmed around each other, I'd guess I'd draw three parts responsiveness for every two parts of randomness. It's a thing that always threatens to unravel but never does.</p>
<p>There's a thrill to that, but there's also an inherent formula, and if these tracks feel more like formal exercises than structured compositions, it's because, well, they kind of are. <i>Flumina</i> is actually a concept record that Sakamoto hatched before going on tour earlier this year, and the concept itself is every bit as elegant as you'd expect from someone of his restraint. Beginning in March, he opened each live show by playing a new composition in a different key. By the end of April, he'd accumulated 24 recordings, each in a different key, thereby covering every tonal variant in modern Western music.</p>
<p>According to Sakamoto, these tracks were composed from afar with a Fennesz collaboration in mind. That's a lovely thought, and the fact that the record was released so soon after speaks to their mutual admiration. And yet, if one can complain about anything on an album as diffuse as this, it's that Fennesz isn't foregrounded often enough. While something like 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10236-cendre/"" target=""_blank"">Cendre</a></i> benefited greatly from an occasional splash of his cotton-wool electronics, there are very few moments like that here, and frankly, it needs more. Those who listen to <i>Flumina</i> actively for its full two hours might also miss that extra element. If you listen to <i>Flumina</i> like I do, though, passively or in short bursts, you're ultimately left with variations on the same thought: This is still an inspired combination.</p></div>"|16107.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16107-flumina/|7.0|Mark Pytlik

Researching the rich history of American folk music for material she could interpret, Veirs cast a wide net to include not only tunes written expressly for kids, but any other compositions she felt could reasonably slot alongside the likes of ""Little Lap Dog Lullaby"" and ""King Kong Kitchie Kitchie Ki-Me-O"". Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the way our 21st-century ears tend to hear anything written 50 or 100 or more years ago as comparatively quaint, songs as thematically disparate as the Civil War-era ""Soldier's Joy"" (here a duet with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1043-the-decemberists/"" target=""_blank"">the Decemberists</a>' Colin Meloy) and a calypso tune popularized by Harry Belafonte, ""Jamaica Farewell"", don't feel so out of place on a record aimed at little ones.</p>
<p>Then again, another thing many of these songs have in common is being really strange, and occasionally even quite dark. Listening to some of Veirs' cover choices makes you think of Greil Marcus' famous description of the folk material Bob Dylan and the Band mined in the late 1960s as capturing the ""old, weird America."" There's Woody Guthrie's ""Why Oh Why"", featuring such bizarre existential quandries as ""Why can't a bird eat an elephant?"" and ""Why ain't my grandpa my grandma?"" There's plenty more that's just flat-out macabre, like the title character of ""The Fox"" informing a pen of doomed ducks and geese that ""a couple of you gonna grease my chin."" Sure enough he keeps his promise, his whole family feasts on the fowl, and the song ends by gleefully pointing out that ""the little ones chewed on the bones."" Then there's ""All the Pretty Little Horses"" (also covered in recent years by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/650-calexico/"" target=""_blank"">Calexico</a> and, earlier, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/906-current-93/"" target=""_blank"">Current 93</a> with Nick Cave), a superficially gentle (hear the percussive elements kindly mimicing jangling spurs) but deeply haunting African-American lullaby dating back to the days of slavery; many versions have neutered the song by altering its most harrowing lines, but Veirs retains them: ""Way down yonder, down in the medder/ There's a poor little lambie/ Bees and the butterflies pecking at its eye/ Poor little thing cried 'Mammy.'""</p>
<p>The title track, a Karl Blau song, is also underlined by a grown-up recognition of disappointment and loss. The music may be jaunty, riding playful trumpets and sparkly keys, but the words and Veirs' fragile voice point to a more sobering reality. ""She'll sting me as she longs to be free,"" Veirs sings of the titular insect. <i>Tumble Bee</i> is a welcome addition to contemporary children's music, not only because it's sufficiently involving to appeal to adults, but also because it further demonstrates that songs for kids don't have to be cloying or sanitized.</p></div>"|16105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16105-tumble-bee/|7.5|Joshua Love

To my mind, that's no bad thing, but if you're one of those dance fans who thinks the music constantly needs to be mutating into new forms, you may not be quite as excited by this news. Like so many French producers who came up in the wake of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>'s <i>Homework</i>, Falke seems to think house music was perfected around the turn of the millennium, when the twin sounds of Thomas Bangalter's Roulé imprint and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo's Crydamoure label-ruled Parisian clubs.</p>
<p>There's not a single <i>sound</i> on <i>Part IV</i>, Falke's first solo album, that you also couldn't find on a French dance single from the late 1990s. If you were around at the time, or you've caught up on the pre-millennial Gallic glory days in the wake of DP's pyramid-rocking global success, the sense of déjà vu, of listening to an everything-in-its-right-place collection of familiar and still pungent tricks, will be time-warp disarming. The wildly woozy disco cut-ups of ""Last Wave"" and ""Look Into Your Eyes"", which spend seven or eight minutes chopping and filtering the same bits of insistent boogie bass and mantra-like soul samples, are straight out of Roulé's playbook. The massive synths all over the record, compressed to an overwhelming mid-range buzz, still split the difference between 1980s soft-pop and just-shy-of-dissonant tech-house, just like you'd find on a classic Crydamoure label cut. Even the harsh stuff, say the thuggish electro-goes-metal riff that drags ""Bare Knuckle"" through its paces, which you might think owes something to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2223-justice/"" target=""_blank"">Justice</a> and the Ed Banger crew's assaults on good taste from a few years back, still has its roots in Daft Punk at their most ear-scouring and inhuman.</p>
<p>Of course Falke's not the only current producer to be acting as if everything from minimal to dubstep never happened. The skyscraper-sized riffs, endlessly bumping beats (pitched between deep-house smoothness and stadium-sized techno ruthlessness), and extremist pop gloss of circa 1999 French dance are still everywhere these days, including your local <i>Billboard</i>-friendly pop station. Everything on <i>Part IV</i> is unabashedly huge and peak-time (or drive-time) ready. Slap a pop star on a couple of these tracks, and Falke could be competing with mercenary goons like David Guetta. The difference between Falke and the current crop of club-turned-radio kings, however, is that under the Ibiza-ready wall-of-sound there's an audible love for old-school disco, another thing that marks him out as a French heir to a very French tradition. The fluidity of the basslines all across <i>Part IV</i> nods to both Falke's origins as a bassist and the funkiness of the live band disco days, fluidity and funkiness being two qualities decidedly missing from the robotic ruthlessness of Guetta-style pop-house.</p>
<p>The question, of course, is do you <i>need</i> this album if you're already steeped in the classics? It'd be a fib to say that Falke does anything particularly unexpected or inventive with this material. He just knows what he likes, and he's got a very strong, slick grasp on how to assemble the ""perfect"" (if sometimes slightly generic) French house tune, to give you a powerful hit of an old drug.  The styles plundered on <i>Part IV</i> comprise a long-proven formula for getting the adrenaline pumping, not something to sneer at when talking dance music. Falke's spent 10 years tweaking these templates until everything is maximally effective, and even if he's no innovator, at least we get to luxuriate in the rush.</p></div>"|16100.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16100-part-iv/|6.5|Jess Harvell

A decidedly more personal than commercial album-- with a few songs in German and one sung by her son-- <i>Desertshore</i> was not a hit, at least not on par with her debut or her albums with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a>, but it continues to attract as many listeners as it repels. Similarly, Desertshore the band represents guitarist Phil Carney's first step away from sideman status, after a stint in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3539-red-house-painters/"" target=""_blank"">Red House Painters</a> and a few appearances on albums and tours by former Painters frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2331-mark-kozelek/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Kozelek</a>. Carney favors patient, shimmery repetitions of notes that establish tone instead of melody, and the group, which also includes pianist Chris Connolly and a rotation of percussionists, trades in glacial instrumentals that echo the sepiatone reminiscences of the best Painters tracks.</p>
<p>Desertshore, however, do not represent a conscious attempt by Carney to escape that band's orbit; it's less a solo or even a duo project than it is a collaborative entity. Kozelek signed the band to his own Caldo Verde label and contributed to their 2010 debut, <i>Drifting Your Majesty.</i> Now, almost inevitably, Kozelek has more or less joined the group: On their follow-up, <i>Drawing of Threes</i>, he plays barely noticeable basslines and adds lyrics and vocals to six of these 10 songs. It may be as close to a Red House Painters reunion as we will get-- at least until Kozelek reconvenes the original <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Kil Moon</a> line-up.</p>
<p>As a result of Kozelek's participation,<i> <span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">Drawing of Threes</span></i><span style=""font-family: Georgia;""> will sound deeply familiar to anyone who's heard any of the bands mentioned so far. His voice remains distinctively hollow-eyed, his vocal melodies sound as eloquently understated as ever, and the guitars ring in a darkly ruminative mood that sets Desertshore in the same 3 a.m. universe as <i><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/reviews/albums/6713-old-ramon/"">Old Ramon</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/reviews/albums/6713-old-ramon/"">Ghosts of Great Highway</a></i>. In other words, Kozelek dominates this album. Of the four instrumental tracks, only one-- the standout ""Matchlight Arcana""-- exceeds the two-minute mark, while the others sound like soundtrack interstitials consigned to the album's second half. It's an odd dynamic: the guest plays the lead, the name band becomes the support. Whether that speaks to Desertshore's modesty or timidity is never quite clear.</span></p>
<p>Still, it's obvious why the musicians gravitate toward one another, not only here but on previous tours and Kozelek solo records: Their particular instruments suit each other evocatively, each bringing out something intriguing and perhaps unnoticed in the other. In that regard, <i>Drawing</i> is best when it casts the familiar elements in a new light. ""Vernon Forrest"" sets Kozelek's vocals against Connolly's sunlight-on-water piano ripples, like a demo for the vox-and-keys album you know Kozelek has in him. ""Randy Quaid"" is a laundry list of half-remembered summertime totems that includes ""Immigrant Song"" and the troubled <i>Vacation</i> actor and manages to rhyme ""Spalding Gray"" with ""the Brothers Quay."" It's an especially playful song for a notoriously depressive singer-songwriter, and Carney's chiming guitar evokes a specific perspective rather than a general sense of nostalgia. Crucially, it sounds more like the memory of summer than summer itself, which lends the song a bittersweet tone. Because <i>Drawing</i> sustains a similar mood across 10 tracks, the album sounds cohesive, if not exactly revelatory. For Kozelek, this is a not unpleasantly minor effort that allows him to stretch out a bit, but it only hints at what all Carney and Connolly can do together.</p></div>"|16095.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16095-drawing-of-threes/|6.9|Stephen M.

The Flaming Lips have already done their Christmas movie soundtrack (and, yes, even have a song about Christmas at the zoo), and this is a Cameron Crowe film we're talking about, one that's being touted as ""from the director of <i>Jerry Maguire</i>,<i>""</i> as opposed to, say, ""from the director of <i>Almost Famous.</i>"" So <a href=""http://jonsi.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jónsi</a> it is, and you can't argue with the decision. As frontman of <a href=""http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sigur Rós</a>, his vocals embody wide-eyed wonder without devolving into unbearable twee overload. So <i>We Bought a Zoo </i>naturally manifests as a work of mutual admiration and mutual benefit and everyone comes out of it feeling better about themselves. Which is to say that above all else, the level of risk and likelihood to satisfy is on par with that of, say, a Cameron Crowe movie being released for the holidays.</p>
<p>What Crowe gets out of this relationship is obvious. But if Jónsi actually ever needed an audio résumé to snag more jobs like this one, he could just slap down a USB of <i>We Bought a Zoo </i>and have it speak for his emergence as a unique, bankable commodity post-<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7151-agaetis-byrjun/"" target=""_blank"">Ágætis Byrjun</a></i>. This is partially by design: one Sigur Rós song is included, but it's an epochal one. Much like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L64BcCRDAE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Svefn-g-englar""</a> (a major player on the soundtrack to Crowe's <i>Vanilla Sky</i>), ""Hoppípolla"" has become shorthand for a specific era of Sigur Rós, indicative of their brassier, bolder, and more concise songwriting that came after <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7152-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank"">( )</a> </i>stretched their most inscrutable tendencies to infinity.</p>
<p><i>We Bought a Zoo </i>gets its spark from key tracks off Jónsi's 2010 solo album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14098-go/"" target=""_blank"">Go</a></i>. Yes, it's hard to separate Jónsi from his day gig, but if <i>We Bought a Zoo </i>gets people to think of <i>Go </i>as far more than something other than a Sigur Rós spinoff, well, hopefully it'll inspire Jónsi to give us more of the same. Despite the greater prevalence of synthetic strings and dance beats, there's something more primal about these songs than those of latter day Sigur Rós. ""Go Do"" speaks to a universal ideal of action and while time will reveal how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11684-boy-lilikoi/"" target=""_blank"">""Boy Lilikoi""</a> fits into this particular movie, the childish primitivism would've worked just fine within <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13550-where-the-wild-things-are-ost/"" target=""_blank"">Where the Wild Things Are</a> </i>(though perhaps with Disney animation rather than brooding browns and grays).</p>
<p>So what's the draw for those of us who already share Crowe's ardent Jónsi fanhood? That's where a shade over a half hour of new music he composed for the film comes in, with tasteful brass and string arrangements courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6442-nico-muhly/"" target=""_blank"">Nico Muhly</a>. It's heartening to hear about the film's working title and climactic scene being inspired by 2007 live documentary <i>Heima</i> and the director encouraging Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson to listen to certain Sigur Rós songs to get their energy correct for certain scenes (I expect plenty of beatific, skyward gazing). And certainly, it's exciting to imagine Jónsi coming from Iceland to hunker down with what Crowe calls a ""a toy sample keyboard and a head full of ideas."" But let's not forget that while Crowe brought Jónsi in for his uniquely whimsical and weighty approach, it's still whimsy-for-hire.  So those trebly piano twinkles, elegiac tempos, octave-shifted vocals that hover and haunt like friendly ghosts? They're all here, treated with a bit of textural abrasion and arranged into small, three-minute packages with utilitarian titles like ""Sun"", ""Brambles"", and ""Humming"". Even one of two vocal tracks Jónsi composed specifically for the film hints a little to the melody from ""White Christmas"". Dude's a good company man.</p>
<p>Of course, it's all lovely and certainly more immediately engaging and compact than Jónsi's mostly-instrumental <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27816-riceboy-sleeps/"" target=""_blank"">Riceboy Sleeps</a></i> multimedia project from 2009. But it also has something going for it more important than gorgeous ambience: the Jónsi seal of quality. Does his work as an arranger and curator rank in the same percentile as his work as a vocalist? Not really, and even if starlit passages like ""Sinking Friendships"" or the luxuriant title track put in fine work with moving images, they aren't likely to dislodge anything from the upper echelon of his past work. But hopefully, offering the bold and evolving gestures of Jónsi's past decade in a relatively safe and compact design allows the possibility that a moviegoer might come out of the theater curious enough to parlay $10 into a meaningful relationship with Jónsi's music. And if that's the case, I think a lot of us are jealous of those who get to experience Sigur Rós for the first time in 2011.</p></div>"|16104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16104-we-bought-a-zoo/|7.0|Ian Cohen

Perhaps it's because Montreal is the North American metropolis with the most pronounced European influence, but even local bands of metal (Voivod), Britpop (the Dears), electro-punk (Les Georges Leningrad), and populist-indie (Arcade Fire) origin have embraced the genre's narrative qualities, intricate musicality, and theatricality. Montreal's <a href=""http://www.ytstlabs.com/blog/#top"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yamantaka//Sonic Titan</a> are the latest torch-bearers for the city's prog-and-proud tradition. But where the most renowned prog-rock bands have introduced thematic frameworks into their music very gradually over the course several years-- remember, even Rush started out writing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcfnGaX-BdQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">three-minute pop crotch-rockers about wanting to get laid</a>-- the conceptual scope and song-cycle composition heard on <i>YT//ST</i> is the result of refinement and focus.</p>
<p>To say the duo of Ruby Kato Attwood and Alaska B have lofty ambitions would be an understatement. Being of Anglo-Asian descent-- the former is Japanese-Scottish, the latter Chinese-Irish-- the two formed Yamantaka//Sonic Titan to address the duality of their cultural identities, as reflected in their band's double name, not to mention the tendency to appear in public <a href=""http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsb3ybFLM11qmiglmo1_400.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sporting kabuki face paint and bikinis</a>. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIB95Ly966A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Early shows</a> were reportedly defined by decorative stage sets, performance art, homemade instruments made of trash and noisy experimentation, as the duo worked toward the goal of making its debut album a full-blown ""noh-wave"" rock opera, titled <i>Star</i>. Now that YT//ST have solidified into an eight-piece rock-band formation, they've issued this album as a 30-minute preview of that larger, still-in-progress work. But the record feels wholly substantial and satisfying in its own right, and even those with no prior knowledge of YT//ST's history and elaborate intentions can just enjoy it for what it is: volcanic prog-rock colored with equal parts post-punk urgency, stoner-metal heft, and psychedelic pop whimsy.</p>
<p>Thanks to smart, brisk sequencing, the seven disparate songs presented here hang together as a seamless piece, even if the thematic devices linking them aren't so easy to discern: The tribal-ceremonial scene setter ""Queens"" offers references to ravens, snakes, hounds, and Alejandro Jodorowsky's surrealist-horror classic <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_k8oaeHsnc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Holy Mountain</a></i>, but it proves to be the only lyrically legible song on the album, as Ruby and Alaska become increasingly reliant on words of indeterminate language and ghostly harmonies. However, inscrutably titled songs like the funhouse-mirrored acid-pop of ""Reverse Crystal//Murder of a Spider"" and the space-age stomper ""Hoshi Neko"" nonetheless display an insidiously melodic quality that suggests <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"" target=""_blank"">Stereolab</a> on steroids. And where these songs foreground YT//ST's eccentric side, the nightmarish, seven-minute colossus ""A Star Over Pureland"" showcases their command of brute physicality, pitting the ladies' echo-drenched shrieks against a relentless, jackhammered fuzz-metal assault, like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swG6Rry9Tss"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Fly</i>-era Yoko Ono</a> waging war with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/"" target=""_blank"">Lightning Bolt</a>. Yamantaka//Sonic Titan may still aspire to the sort of conceptual grandeur that requires an Olympic Stadium to contain it, but right now, what they're really good at is putting the ""raw"" in prog.</p></div>"|16097.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16097-yamantakasonic-titan/|8.2|Stuart Berman

So has been the short, frustrating story of Chicago MC <a href=""http://kidsistermusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kid Sister</a>, whose potential as a bona fide party-rocker on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-Ztb43Qu6Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pro Nails""</a> gave way to 2009's oft-delayed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13684-ultraviolet/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ultraviolet</i></a>, a record of party-pop pablum crammed into a thin, day-glo colored shell. <i>Ultraviolet</i> clearly encouraged Kid Sister to reevaluate her career, as she remained somewhat quiet until last January, when she offered up the vaguely <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Diplo</a>-vian, world-party vibing <a href=""http://www.foolsgoldrecs.com/kidsister/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Kiss Kiss Kiss</i></a> freebie mixtape. Now there's <i>Kiss &amp; Tell</i>, a four-track EP that aims to reestablish Kid Sister as the brash, brazen rap star she hinted at becoming out of the gate.</p>
<p>So it's kind of a shame that, at a time when the demand for brash, brazen female voices in hip-hop seems to be at an encouraging high, Kid Sister has delivered another stop-gap that highlights her inability recapture or recontextualize her style or persona as a mic-rocking diva worthy of your undivided attention. Instead, <i>Kiss &amp; Tell</i> is yet another entry in a long line of teases that seems to be an exercise in obligation rather than anticipation, with generic rhymes, little hook appeal and only four new verses to its credit. Most of it fails to really offer fans anything new-- actually, if it weren't for the fact that you could stream the entire thing for free, it's unclear as to why anyone would bother giving it a go. Clocking in at just under 11 minutes, <i>Kiss &amp; Tell</i> features two new tracks, a polished version of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px6PoAaNNlk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Click Clack (Show It Off)""</a> from <i>Kiss Kiss Kiss</i> (simplified here as ""Cliq Claq""), plus a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wccdNFFfof8&amp;feature=player_embedded#!"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix</a> of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YV9U1xpaN0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gucci Rag Top""</a> from the same tape.</p>
<p>The good news here is that, in an attempt to supplement her personality and remain current, she locks down two fun features, with <a href=""http://www.foolsgoldrecs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fool's Gold</a> labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a> and lobotomized pop-rap experiment <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOfClVBdXUI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MTV Riff Raff</a>, respectively. ""Gucci Rag Top"" already had a kind of trap-approved Salt-N-Pepa playfulness to it when Gucci Mane was on it, but he's easily bested here, with Brown wedging in yet another great verse in a year he's already packed with gems (not to mention, the video has now blessed us with <a href=""http://rapindustryfanfiction.com/post/13187646684"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a>). And on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOZMWC87oig"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hide &amp; Seek""</a> (which features some clean production from Sinden), everyone's favorite former <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/shows/g_to_gents/season_2/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10701"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""From G's to Gents""</a> contestant gets to threaten to ""pull up on you jokes in my yacht-style boat.""</p>
<p>Still, Kid Sister never seems to get with the program. The cartoonish fun of ""Hide &amp; Seek"" seems lost on her, and new track ""Mickey"" irritates without the benefit of offering an accompanying YouTube dance craze. But this is all coming from an EP that has done the absolute minimum to keep its name in what I expect to be tightening, specific circles. Obviously <i>Kiss &amp; Tell</i> is priming us for a sophomore full-length (the Neptunes are <a href=""http://www.astheworldspins.com/?p=1796"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rumored</a> to be in the fold), but it's hard to tell what it says about the direction she's headed in. Judging from the amount of effort that went into this, we may never get the chance to find out.</p></div>"|16096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16096-kid-sister-kiss-tell-ep/|5.2|Zach Kelly

In a cultural moment when the past is instantly accessible-- not to mention one in which we're used to constant reference and appropriation-- it makes sense that we start conflating ""who we are"" with ""what we're into."" Instead of creating, the artist collects. As viewers-- or listeners, or whatever-- we learn to read between the lines and explore juxtapositions. Is it possible, for example, for me to express something about myself that can't be best expressed by saying, ""I'm pretty into Hawaiian slack-key guitar music and body horror movies?"" Liking things-- something we all do by reflex-- becomes a creative gesture if you do it thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Listening to <a href=""http://alteredzones.com/posts/2130/stream-co-las-daydream-repeater/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Daydream Repeater</i></a>, Ecstatic Sunshine member Matthew Papich's first full-length album as <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/co_la"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Co La</a>, I revisited an experience I haven't had since college: Walking down the street, seeing someone wearing the t-shirt of a band I like, and thinking, cool. It's comforting to know other people like the same things we do-- in this case, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyeG5Vp5j00"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">skinhead reggae from the mid-1960s</a>, <a href=""http://www.baka.co.uk/baka/mp3_yelli.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">field recordings from the Cameroonian rainforest</a>, cricket noises, music in major keys. It's an incredibly lightweight album-- thin-sounding, super-repetitive, bright to the point of translucence.  (Though <i>Daydream Repeater </i>doesn't sound stylistically like Ecstatic Sunshine, people familiar with them might recognize the directive: feel good all the time, over and over again). Papich is no archeologist, nor do I think he's trying to show off his knowledge of obscure sounds-- most of the time, he doesn't even bother disguising his samples.</p>
<p>Whether you attribute this to laziness or naive grace probably depends on frame of mind. By techno or hip-hop standards, <i>Daydream Repeater</i> would be artless, but my sense is that the music on it is closer to something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4832-girl-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Girl Talk</a> for audiences who don't like getting the shit beaten out of them-- music that wants you to say, ""Hey, I recognize that,"" music that makes you feel included rather than excluded.</p>
<p>When interviewed for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8711-co-la/"">a ""Rising"" column a few weeks ago</a>, Papich namechecked <a href=""http://www.ubu.com/sound/satie.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Erik Satie</a>, a turn-of-the-century French composer who coined the term <i>musique d'ameublement</i>, or ""furniture music""-- basically, the foundation for what we now call ""ambient."" Clearly Papich wants to be part of that conversation, or he wouldn't have made the reference. Whether he adds much to it or not, I don't know. The irony of Satie's music is that, at the time, it was considered radical and antagonistic. Papich has 100 years of art to validate music as brainless and determinedly relaxing as his own.</p>
<p>I've listened to <i>Daydream Repeater</i> a lot lately, but at moments when I otherwise don't want to be listening to music. To my mind, it sounds less like ambience and more like exotica. Its imaginary world is the yacht deck without seasickness or boredom, jungles without the fist-sized bugs. It's music for imagining you're in a perfect somewhere else. Five songs are named after places: ""Egyptian Peaches"", ""Belgian Pillow"", ""My Jamaican"", ""Siamese in Greece"", ""Burning One in Stockholm.""</p>
<p>That's where the Tumblr thing comes in. <i>Daydream Repeater</i> plays more like a mixtape than an album-- a document of where someone's been and what they've liked. Aside from one surprising flip of ""Be My Baby"", Papich doesn't seem as interested in transforming his source material as much as just presenting it. Here's a reggae song I like, he says, and then plays it with some echo. A couple of minutes later, something else. In the cracks between, some aesthetic takes shape.  Some of my colleagues here seem outright frustrated by how little Papich seems to interact with his material. For a record so airy and noncommittal, I feel semi-conflicted about it. He doesn't really seem bent on invention. But I like listening to <i>Daydream Repeater</i>. I'd repost it.</p></div>"|16080.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16080-co-la-weekend-repeater/|6.2|Mike Powell

They've been touring the basement show circuit and putting out occasional, limited-run releases since 2009, although I hadn't heard of them until this year's SXSW festival, when my band shared a makeshift wooden stage with them, at an unofficial backyard showcase in South Austin, hosted by WNYU. The odor of smoke, brisket, and crawfish stew seemed the perfect accompaniment to their twangy, somewhat ramshackle blend of 1960s psychedelia, mantric blues, and folk, and I remember realizing that they were the first band I had heard all week whose vocal parts included classic, three-part harmonies-- and whose use of a Farfisa was less retro-futuristic than straight-up retro.</p>
<p>Quilt sounded kind of like a flashback to a time, not so long ago, when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3980-sunburned-hand-of-the-man/"" target=""_blank"">Sunburned Hand of the Man</a> made the cover of <i>The Wire</i> under the banner of ""New Weird America,"" and artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"" target=""_blank"">Devendra Banhart</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3807-six-organs-of-admittance/"" target=""_blank"">Six Organs of Admittance</a> prompted indie music fans to snap up reissues of outsider folk records by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/575-vashti-bunyan/"" target=""_blank"">Vashti Bunyan</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5849-jandek/"" target=""_blank"">Jandek</a>, and Alexander ""Skip"" Spence. The members of Quilt are probably old enough to remember and have been impacted by a time-- roughly around the mid-aughts-- when the global economy was still in a boom phase rather than a bust, and much of the independent music community seemed bent on expressing its independent-mindedness through an ethos of retreat: out of the city and into the woods, back through the years to the screaming guitar solos and of the hippy generation and the vulnerable rawness of Anglo-American folk singing, inward to the depths of the psyche and the eccentricites of character. The thing that struck me most about Quilt, at the time, was not that they seemed to be backtracking to a revivalist movement in recent memory that was not exactly their generation's own; it was that the particular reference points they were drawing on simply weren't ones I had heard in a while.</p>
<p>Like their namesake, Quilt's music feels handmade and stitched-together, as though its creators were sifting through a collection of musical hand-me-downs and collating the bits that spoke to them into something new. This patchwork quality extends not only to their juxtaposition, say, of Neil Young bass-bounce and the kind of half-spoken poetic narration you might hear on one of the Incredible String Band's early records, but to their melodic sensibility at large, which favors tightly interlocking arrangements of simple motifs. The band's writing process, so they say, consists in endlessly improvising on a collection of predetermined chord progressions, and the resulting intricacy comes particularly to the fore on their self-titled debut for Mexican Summer, which they recorded with the help of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/187-apollo-sunshine/"" target=""_blank"">Apollo Sunshine</a>'s Jesse Gallagher in the summers of 2010 and 2011. Percussion work was split between founding drummer Taylor Mcvay and John Andrews, who has since replaced her.</p>
<p><i>Quilt</i> unfolds in a series of vividly colored scenes, ranging from the hushed suspense of opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12667-young-gold/"" target=""_blank"">""Young Gold""</a> to bouncy, open road cruisers like ""Cowboys in the Void"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12518-penobska-oakwalk/"" target=""_blank"">""Penobska Oakwalk""</a>, and the lovesick sweetness of ""Utopian Canyon"", which casts Fox Rochinski's crystalline soprano front and center. Shifts in tempo and key occur frequently within a single song, with Butler and Fox Rochinski trading off the narration as vocal harmonies move like tectonic plates around the central melodic line. On standout ""Cowboys in the Void"", a snaky guitar duel enhances our impression of theatrical tension until an unexpected vocal yelp comes along and dispels it, capturing all the terror and exhilaration of jumping into the titular unknown.</p>
<p>Again, there's the creeping sensation that we have heard a lot these melodies and transitions and echoing guitar notes before. Either they replicate specific moments in the history of 20th-century American music that we cannot concretely pin down, or they are designed to reflect a set of unwritten expectations and parameters-- the kind of collective sensibility that allows us to predict how the slightly detuned, chromatic banjo pattern on closer ""Gome Home"" might resolve itself at the end of the phrase, for example, or identify this music as ""Americana,"" or distinctly ""American,"" even if we are unable to say what those words really mean.</p>
<p>In its less captivating passages, which are few, <i>Quilt </i>will sound like a pitch-perfect rendition of some 1969 acid-folk reissue that was never quite as memorable as you hoped. At its most exhilarating, the record may recall a time when you blasted a song like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0UcQDUR-fU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""California Dreamin'""</a>, and thought about how doubly thrilling it must have been when your parents first experienced it, and it <i>actually</i> sounded unlike anything they had ever heard. The members of Quilt couldn't possibly have predicted the impact of the call for change that would originate from their own generation just a few months after they completed the record, but they do seem strangely prescient on ""Children of Light"", when they sing, ""We're going off to war/ Not like the one before."" As for imagining what a politically engaged music of the y-generation might sound like, and how it might differ from that of the baby boomers, Butler offers up some curious food for thought on ""Penobska Oakwalk"": ""Why would we try, why should we try to make anew/ When we could be intoxicated by this ordinary turn again?""</p></div>"|16089.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16089-quilt/|7.2|Emilie Friedlander

Eventual result: deserved ignominy (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4484-the-vines/"" target=""_blank"">the Vines</a>), undeserved ignominy (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1957-the-hives/"" target=""_blank"">the Hives</a>), bewildered near-implosion (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">the Strokes</a>), and bewildering total implosion (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"" target=""_blank"">the White Stripes</a>). The years have not been kind.</p>
<p>You didn't figure the Keys as sole survivors and mainstream lifers when <i>The Big Come Up</i> emerged in 2002 and offered a walking rockist orgasm: two gawky white dudes from Akron, Ohio, drums and surly guitar and burning-oatmeal-mouthed yawps of not terribly articulate romantic frustration, all powering cartoonishly virile garage-blues jams of prison-phone-call fidelity and sentiment. Ridiculous and kind of awesome. (This assumes racially uneasy cultural appropriation is no longer an issue for you, but if so, feel free to evoke the Blueshammer scene in the <i>Ghost World</i> movie and the hell with it.)</p>
<p>And so. They named their second album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/766-thickfreakness/"" target=""_blank"">Thickfreakness</a></i>; they recorded their third album in an abandoned tire factory and named it <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/767-rubber-factory/"" target=""_blank"">Rubber Factory</a></i>. For a while there, they always did confoundingly well in critics' polls, as though they were every single rock scribe's seventh-favorite band. They evolved incredibly slowly-- you can enjoy their early work tremendously and never retain five consecutive seconds of it beyond their cover of ""Have Love Will Travel"". <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1186-danger-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Danger Mouse</a> got involved as a producer, to the immediately evident benefit of no one. Coupla daffy side projects in there somewhere. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28271-blakroc/"" target=""_blank"">BlakRoc</a>!) Ah yes, and they got their music in <i>a shitload of ads</i>, from Victoria's Secret to Zales to American Express to Subaru, like just <i>so much capitalism</i>, to the extent that they <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41183-watch-members-of-vampire-weekend-and-the-black-keys-goof-off-on-the-colbert-report/"" target=""_blank"">went on <i>The Colbert Report</i> with Vampire Weekend</a> and clowned themselves about it.</p>
<p>By which time they'd broken through. Last year's <i>Brothers</i>, their sixth album, had wit and pop charm and a minor hit in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/835-tighten-up/"" target=""_blank"">""Tighten Up""</a> (and unremitting bloat, but ah), and thus came the <i>Spin</i> cover, the <i>Saturday Night Live</i> appearances, the Grammys. And now we greet <i>El Camino</i>, their best and (not coincidentally) goofiest album, a veritable frat-worthy ""Pimp 'n' Ho"" party in which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"" target=""_blank"">T. Rex</a> has somehow been tricked into serving as house band. The riffs are glam-nasty, the lyrics sublimely knuckleheaded, the basslines nimble and bombastic, the mood frivolous and fun and unabashedly corny. It's way shorter than <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14222-brothers/"" target=""_blank"">Brothers</a></i>, too. Sweet cars, witchy women, ""Gold on the Ceiling."" A bizarre attempt to philosophically combine the videos for ""Sabotage"" and ""Legs"". The fine line between a tricked-out GTO and ""GTFO.""</p>
<p>Danger Mouse figured it out, for one thing. He unnecessarily arted up 2008's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11358-attack-release/"" target=""_blank"">Attack &amp; Release</a></i> (plus the hit off <i>Brothers</i>), and his angelic-choir/space-glockenspiel Super Mario Galaxy fantasias still distract-- everything's a goddamn spaghetti western with this guy. But <i>Camino</i>'s sonic frills are mercifully few, content to stick your head right in Patrick Carney's bass drum as he stomps through the caveman jam ""Hell of a Season"" with virtuosic anti-virtuosity, or revel in the machine-gun surge of Dan Auerbach's gong-banging guitar on surging opener ""Lonely Boy"". It's a shame <i>Rock Band </i>is no longer a thing. ""Gold on the Ceiling"" is just<i> filthy</i>, like George Thorogood scoring porn, all raunchy organ and licentious handclaps and chorus help from ladies attempting to sound like the sorts of ladies Steely Dan loved to write songs about. ""I wanna buy some time/ But don't have a dime,"" goes the raucous one called ""Money Maker"". Better cash some Subaru checks.</p>
<p>The lyrics! The lyrics are hilarious. Great advice, via <i>Brothers</i>: ""Well, you can watch her strut/ But keep your mouth shut."" God bless Auerbach for ignoring it, and, amid the keening/crunching stomp of ""Run Right Back"", dropping some serious knowledge:  ""Well she's a special thing/ She doesn't read too much, oh/ But there's no doubt/ She's written about."" Which is really just a prelude to the miraculous five-word sequence that is ""Finest exterior/ She's so superior,"" which, Jesus. Show me the CARFAX, Romeo. Your emotional climax is ""Little Black Submarines"", which starts acoustic and pathos-ridden: ""A broken heart is blind,"" goes the biologically suspect refrain. But then, <i>hosanna, </i>the distortion kicks in, the riff from ""Mary Jane's Last Dance"" is lifted wholesale, and suddenly we are <i>rocking</i>, Carney and Auerbach in call-and-response/attack-and-release napalm mode, back in the rubber factory in spirit if not tax bracket.</p>
<p>Yes, well. Consider <i>El Camino</i> the aural equivalent of one of those Chrysler ""Imported from Detroit"" ads where a $47,000 car slowly rolls through one of the most devastated cities in America, a sign for 8 Mile Road glimpsed through tinted windows: the finest in luxury grit. Seedy, escapist camp, crass but expert, so expert. That they're the true victors of the 2000s garage explosion is no shock at all. Rock came back. Commerce never left.</p></div>"|16098.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16098-el-camino/|7.4|Rob Harvilla

The album maintains some of the overweening humor of <a href=""http://www.iamdonald.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Donald Glover</a>'s sitcom ""Community"", but Glover's exaggerated, cartoonish flow and overblown pop-rap production are enough to make <i>Camp</i> one of the most uniquely unlikable rap records of this year (and most others). What's worse is how he uses heavy topics like race, masculinity, relationships, street cred, and ""real hip-hop"" as props to construct a false outsider persona. On record, he paints himself as a misunderstood victim of cultural preconceptions who is <i>obviously</i> smarter and funnier than his primetime material suggests. Unfortunately, it's a position that holds up to absolutely no scrutiny whatsoever.</p>
<p>Glover's not doing himself any favors with a rap handle taken from the <a href=""http://www.recordstore.com/wuname/wuname.pl"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wu-Tang Name Generator</a>, but that'd be easy to overlook if <i>Camp</i> functioned as anything more than a series of similar one-note gags. On a song-by-song basis, he scripts a slightly off-brand, fictional version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a> being played for laughs. We could talk about Glover's bloodlines all day, but Childish Gambino's paternity test traces straight back to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kyWDhB_QeI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All Falls Down""</a>. ""You See Me"" reimagines ""Niggas in Paris"" as a meme cemetery, with Glover painfully leaning into herniated punchlines like, ""She's an overachiever/ All she does is <i>suck seed</i>."" (Or maybe ""Asian girls everywhere... UCLA!"" will eventually end up on a T-shirt.) The bottle-service electro of ""Heartbeat"" could have been the 10th-funniest song on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/"" target=""_blank"">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a></i>-- somewhere between <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy6W7eYlW1Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Coldest Winter""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZwMX6T5Jhk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Love Lockdown""</a>-- and <i>it's</i> actually trying for laughs. A few of <i>Camp</i>'s tracks focus on more inspirational topics than ""making up for the fucks I missed in high school,"" but they usually emulate <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jesus Walks""</a>, or when trying to be slightly more humble,<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVtpXvzzXiA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Get By""</a>. And any shred of relatability Glover establishes by reminiscing about sinkbaths with his cousin, or trying to fit into the white school his parents busted their asses to send him to, are cancelled out by R&amp;B hooks so garish and impersonal they make <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1657-lupe-fiasco/"" target=""_blank"">Lupe Fiasco</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15208-lasers/"" target=""_blank"">Lasers</a></i> sound dignified.</p>
<p>Supporters may rush to praise Glover as a ""multi-talent"" due to <i>Camp's</i> self-production, but his cratedigging begins with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8767-the-college-dropout/"" target=""_blank"">The College Dropout</a></i> and ends with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/"" target=""_blank"">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a></i>, all of it <a href=""http://blingee.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blingee</a>'d up with assistance from ""Community"" composer Ludwig Goransson. Yes, that's a lot of Yeezy talk, but the most insidious aspect of <i>Camp</i> is how Glover operates from a <i>pre-</i>Kanye inferiority complex where he senses that any dismissal of his music stems from gangsta rap still being the predominant aesthetic version of hip-hop (never mind that the most commercially relevant guy who can be feasibly be called ""gangsta rap"" right now is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>, and even he's widely beloved on account of being an acknowledged pathological liar). This much is obvious from the tone-deaf ""All of the Shine,"" and especially ""Backpackers"", a preemptive strike at his always-male, usually educated haters. Note how its title co-opts the one epithet more outdated than ""hipster"" in rap music circa 2011.</p>
<p>Glover isn't strictly a comedy rapper, but he flows like a comic actor: When he's trying to be playful, his voice hitches in a pubescent squeak, and when he ""goes in,"" he's still delivering one room-clearing punchline after another with the earnestness of the most confused Rhymesayers guy ever. At the very least, <i>Camp</i> can serve as hashtag rap's tombstone, and I'll just present some choice quotes without comment so you can decide for yourself: ""I made the beat and murdered it, Casey Anthony,"" ""You can kiss my ass, Human Centipede,"" ""I got a girl on my arm, dude show respect/ Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech.""</p>
<p>Every attempt Glover makes to present himself as an inside operative confounding stereotypes about mainstream rap rings totally false. In ""Fire Fly"", he brags about the ease of scoring college gigs and college girls (while rhyming ""LSU"" with ""molest you"") and then complains: ""No live shows because I can't find sponsors/ For the only black guy at a Sufjan concert."" Bullshit. OK, look: I realize that there's a chance some kid will hear that line and feel validated, and you know, the last thing we need is an armchair cracker like myself relating contrary anecdotal evidence about the demographics at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"" target=""_blank"">Sufjan Stevens</a>' last concert. So let's just look at the facts: Jay-Z and Beyoncé <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/36372-jay-z-reps-for-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">could be seen at Grizzly Bear shows</a> in 2009, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Justin Vernon</a> has a free pass to jump on any track he chooses, and producers spent the year sampling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15264-house-of-balloons/"" target=""_blank"">Beach House</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44594-rihanna-samples-the-xx-on-new-album/"" target=""_blank"">the xx</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12493-gettin-it-ft-stalley-and-joi-tiffany/"" target=""_blank"">Tame Impala</a>. How does Glover explain Drake? Is he ""crazy or hood,"" or just a half-Jewish, former child actor from Toronto who's already sold 600,000 copies of <i>Take Care </i>while signed to Lil Wayne's record label? I mean, sub-major hip-hop isn't a post-cred, post-racial utopia by any means, but I can't think of another time when there were more options for listeners of just about any race or background seeking to identify with rappers on a non-allegorical level. I just have to assume Glover has completely ignored the success of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"" target=""_blank"">Lil B</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29865-main-attrakionz/"" target=""_blank"">Main Attrakionz</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29238-odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a>, and especially <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a> when he meekly moans, ""Is there room in the game for a lame that rhymes/ And wears short shorts and tells jokes sometimes?"" It's the perfect summation of <i>Camp</i>: preposterously self-obsessed, but not the least bit self-aware. Tell me that ain't insecure.</p></div>"|16074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16074-camp/|1.6|Ian Cohen

I mean, <i>come on</i>. It felt so on-the-nose it hardly needed to exist, like an abandoned Adult Swim pilot in rapper form. Hadn't we all proved to each other that we loved Ghostface enough already? Did we all need to come in for that group hug again? There's a lot of love in that corner, but hoo boy, was it ever growing musty.</p>
<p>But Bronson, as he tends to do, dismantled my defenses. He's that kind of guy; watching YouTube clips of him, say, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnyyficfliM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">searing a slab of ahi tuna</span></a> in an oversized orange Polo shirt is to be mowed over by an irresistible charm offensive. It helps that he's an undeniably talented rapper. He might be sampling Ghostface's voice, but lately Ghostface has been <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14942-apollo-kids/""><span class=""s1"">using it </span></a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13537-ghostdini-the-wizard-of-poetry-in-emerald-city/""><span class=""s1"">wrong</span></a>, and to hear someone pick up Ghost's manic energy where he left it (arguably, somewhere around <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3637-fishscale/"" target=""_blank"">Fishscale</a></i>) is like watching an eager creative team breathe new life into a beloved but weary old franchise.</p>
<p><i>Well-Done</i>, Bronson's followup to his breakthrough, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15497-dr-lecter/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Lecter</a></i>, pairs him with producer <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/statikselektah/music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Statik Selektah</a>, who is something of a spiritual brother-in-arms: Together, they could probably stage a Civil-War-style reenactment of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2klRHBvxo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ice Cream""</a> video. Selektah gives Bronson 15 functionally bumping, minimally tweaked DJ Premier/Pete Rock updates: horn stabs, clipped drums, scratched vocal samples, lots of empty space to fill. Bronson barrels his big-shouldered way through it all, and, like <i>Dr. Lecter</i>, the end result is about as reliably pleasurable as a good slice.</p>
<p>Bronson's biggest strengths are a goofy sense of humor and a refreshing lack of self-regard: At its best, <i>Well-Done</i> is like spending 45 minutes with the affable, roly-poly guy who cracked you up at your high school lunch table. ""See my silhouette, right behind me bitches pirouette/ That's a dance move, it's origin is French,"" he informs us on ""White Silk"". He cracks winningly on his weight: ""Underneath a lot of blubber, lot of six pack."" (""Cocoa Butter""). Say what you will about his originality, but he's unquestionably an innovator in the field of nonsensical Obama namedrops: ""Obama copped me the sandwich!"" he bellows at one point, ""Obama EBT, I'm a G"" at another.</p>
<p>And his gusto with food metaphors rivals Ghost at his <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf_BsCiJ6Sc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""my stomach growlin!""</a> best: his lungs, when he smokes weed, are ""smoky like the pork shoulder."" Instead of crushing up flakes of blow, he raps about ""crushing fennel pollen,"" and his blunt-force conviction renders it as magnetically cool-sounding an activity as coke-kingpin razor-shaving for precisely that millisecond. None of this enacts some magical crowbar separation between him and Ghostface, of course, a separation he's starting to show signs of desiring: He has protested weakly in interviews that his style is actually a cross between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/937-camron/"" target=""_blank"">Cam'ron</a> and Kool G Rap, which is kind of like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4093-shyne/"" target=""_blank"">Shyne</a> insisting he never really listened to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"" target=""_blank"">Biggie</a>. But Bronson shouldn't sweat the comparisons, or worse, try to fend them off: Fondly reminding people of one of the greatest rappers ever is hardly a curse.</p></div>"|16084.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16084-action-bronsonstatik-selektah-well-done/|7.1|Jayson Greene

When most of their peers were products of the widely beloved <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C86_(album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">C86 tape</a> in 2008, the Brooklyn quintet was namedropping <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/artists/774-the-clean/"" target=""_blank"">the Clean</a> cofounder David Kilgour's the Great Unwashed. The components that make their sound are fastidiously plucked from early-1980s Manchester (Joy Divison) and New Zealand (the Clean, the Chills), late-1960s New York (the Velvet Underground), and-- in cases including but not limited to singer Brad Hargett's hair-- early Bob Dylan. But influence doesn't mean anything if it's not siphoned into something worthwhile, and Crystal Stilts do much more than sit on their first-edition copies of Flying Nun vinyl and collect cool points.</p>
<p>Their debut album <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12381-alight-of-night/"">Alight of Night</a></i> found them firing off shimmering guitar lines and then simmering into a thick haze, alternating between sunny afternoon clang and after-hours sulk. Using his voice as another instrument instead of a vehicle for dynamic singing or pseudo-profound lyrical messages, Hargett's deep baritone blends low into the mix, the use of reverb rivaling that of an epic fantasy movie narrator.<i> </i>The album was used as the foundation for this year's <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15304-in-love-with-oblivion/"">In Love With Oblivion</a></i>, though that newer collection was a fuller-sounding affair, more urgent in places (""Shake the Shackles""), more daring in others (""Alien Rivers""), and filled with pop tunes brimming with life from corner to corner. Crystal Stilts are a band that doesn't have much use for empty space-- most of the silence gets chased away by the blasts of trebly volume.</p>
<p><i>Radiant Door</i> is not a radical departure from that default sound; its Kilgour Brothers-indebted style makes it safe to assume kiwi is still the most important item on their tour rider. But not all groups have to rely on the benefit of reinvention. The non-vocalists of Crystal Stilts are incredibly good at adding a Technicolor flair, crafting arrangements so colorful that they often veer into kaleidoscopic territory. Two of the five songs on the EP feature the quintet nakedly putting its record collection at the forefront of its consciousness, this time in the form of recorded covers. The band's take on Blue Orchids' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0UV_elUlas"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Low Profile""</a> is a key example of this; it's faithful enough to the original to be recognizable, but the Stilts' heavy lifting-- as it mostly always does-- comes from keyboardist Kyle Forester and guitarist/co-songwriter JB Townsend, the former turning in a simple-but-catchy three-note riff, the latter sounding like he's been planting <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joshua_Tree"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joshua Trees</a> around Brooklyn.</p>
<p>The EP's other cover, Lee Hazlewood's ""Still as the Night"", finds the band in spaghetti-western outlaw mode, exploring a style they've heretofore never tried. The song is spare in a way that's uncommon to the band. It doesn't quite work with a singer like Hargett, whose booming voice (that sometimes wavers in and out of key) is far more suited to weathering the band's stormier moments than trying to fill in gaps. Though ""Still as the Night"" is a good song that falls just short of being great, it doesn't stall the band-- they've always been adept at playing to their strengths, and the rest of the EP's 21 minutes are full of gleaming keyboard lines and jangly guitars casting sun on everything in sight. For a band that has proven it can do darkness just as well, <i>Radiant Door</i> is exactly as its title suggests-- the brighter side of one of America's best psych-pop bands.</p></div>"|16078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16078-radiant-door-ep/|7.4|Martin Douglas

The quietly ubiquitous sextet has spent its three-year existence amassing cross-genre collaborations like so many passport stamps: you've heard them, wittingly or not, playing with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"" target=""_blank"">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Arcade Fire</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Vampire Weekend</a>-- you get the idea. But they also perform as a more traditional contemporary-classical ensemble, and on <i>Beautiful Mechanical</i>, their first proper full-length, they mix up the two worlds, slotting compositions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"" target=""_blank"">St. Vincent</a>'s Annie Clark and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5641-son-lux/"" target=""_blank"">Son Lux</a> alongside new works from young composer colleagues. The album's existence is a feat of networking savvy and determination-- it was funded via Kickstarter page-- but the music itself is sadly hit-or-miss, underlining a melancholy truth about bridging genre divides: It results in empty press-release fodder as often as it produces luminous, surprising new music.</p>
<p>Son Lux's titular work, ""Beautiful Mechanical"", lands somewhere blankly in the middle. Son Lux is no dabbler: He studied composition at Indiana University. But his work  is somehow both antic and utterly frozen-- its gestures twitter away in  different corners of the compositional space without engaging thematically. The work, which does some sly things with missing beats and rhythmic emphases, is technically assured, but it feels like the sort of forgettable, frictionless, minimalist sketch you can currently hear too many of at downtown-NYC new-music concerts.</p>
<p>Annie  Clark fares significantly better. In fact, her piece, ""Proven  Badlands"", might be the most beguiling and multi-layered composition on the album. On the basis of it alone, Clark could easily slip outside of her indie rock clubhouse entirely for an album's worth of  chamber-music miniatures. ""Badlands"" begins with a swan-necked  glide of a bassoon line, a thrice-digested memory of Gershwin's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U40xBSz6Dc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rhapsody in Blue""</a>. Cello and flute hop lightly into the frame. Then,  the instruments clear out a space for an unexpected finger-picked acoustic  guitar. Interesting things keep happening: A muted trumpet calls out a  yearning tritone, the sharp, ear-troubling interval found at  the heart of <i>West Side Story</i>. Bugling horns erupt into a locked-in  pattern, an arch almost-quote from some lost big-band record. The work is a lively jumble of jazzy-French flavors, strongly suggesting that  Clark's education in the classical canon made a little extra time for  Debussy, Milhaud, and other jazz-age cosmopolitans.</p>
<p>Shara  Worden of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4828-my-brightest-diamond/"" target=""_blank"">My Brightest Diamond</a> also shows up to hand yMusic two sketches-- one  vaguely Eastern, one vaguely African. Both are spry bundles of tiny  noises. Worden's rich singing voice, which lit last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14934-penelope/"" target=""_blank"">Penelope</a></i>, isn't here, but her pieces are imbued with the same lamplight glow. They are minor, but lively. Sarah Kirkland Snider, the composer of<i> Penelope</i>, revisits its agitated sound world with ""Daughter of the  Waves"", a nine-minute swirl of muted anxiety. Judd Greenstein's ""Clearing, Dawn, Dance"" starts with a loping figure in the woodwinds and  sends it rippling expertly outward through the ensemble, like small bobbing  boats in a wake-- tracking its movement and hearing how Greenstein obscures it proves absorbing listening all on its own.</p>
<p>yMusic are part of a resourceful, engaged cluster of young classical musicians who are furiously networking a full-blown scene into existence. Collectively, they represent the movement's best qualities: broad-minded, ambitious, eagerly collaborative. However, <i>Beautiful Mechanical</i> also hints at some of the still-growing scene's nagging limitations: As exciting as all this activity is to behold, the marketing heat it generates carries over into its music only about half of the time. There are delightful moments scattered throughout, but the overall  impression is of a  small box of baubles, modest and lovely but inessential.</p></div>"|16066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16066-ymusic-beautiful-mechanical/|6.7|Jayson Greene

It's ""Throw It Up"", one of the album's highlights. After the song ends, there's a skit where Yelawolf and his boss, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"" target=""_blank"">Eminem</a>, discuss the course of the album. Eminem tells Yelawolf that the album needs songs for women, love songs specifically. Yela, for his part, feigns protest. It's presented as a conversation that any label head might have with an artist, but including it on the album is a bizarre and remarkably cynical move. It's unclear whether it's presented as a warning, an apology, a cop-out, or all three, but it more importantly marks exactly where a potentially great album starts to go off the rails.</p>
<p>The idea of ""crossing over"" is something almost every rapper at a major label has to deal with. Making songs about, and for, women-- be it about love or dancing--  to gain popularity is a move about as old as the genre itself. For some rappers, it's a seamless transition. For others, it's not. It can be frustrating and dispiriting to watch the formula applied to a career that has yet to take shape, though it's a process everyone more or less knows is coming. It's also a route that can be rejected (a recent obvious example being <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29238-odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a>) or navigated deftly (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skhxizRYxps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""No Hands""</a> didn't lose <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"" target=""_blank"">Waka Flocka</a> any cred). Or, I guess, one can take the path Yelawolf chose, to lamely act as if you're a prisoner of a system that you chose to enter and make half-assed songs as if sentenced by law.</p>
<p>And with that rehearsed conversation with Eminem about making love songs for women, Yelawolf is trying to absolve himself from the responsibility of about one-third of <i>Radioactive </i>being decidedly half-assed. The middle of the album (featuring hooks from the likes of Priscilla Renea and Fefe Dobson) is far and away the worst music of Yelawolf's career, and he knows it. His rapping is passable, but the beats are leaden and uninspired and the hooks are about as canned as possible. It's hard to imagine what the market for those songs is, really-- I can't imagine that Yelawolf's female fans want to hear him rap about conventional romance, or want to hear a potentially good song about blue-collar American life drowned in a syrupy chorus.</p>
<p>The worst part isn't the songs themselves, but that the album didn't have to go this route. Outside the sagging middle section, the subject matter and production will be nothing new to those familiar  with Yela's music; his voice and perspective remain sharp and unique, and he certainly hasn't lost any of his technical skill. The guests  (Mystikal, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5605-killer-mike/"" target=""_blank"">Killer Mike</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4388-three-6-mafia/"" target=""_blank"">Three 6 Mafia</a> secret weapon Gangsta Boo) are  also otherwise the type of people that should be on a Yelawolf album,  rappers from whom he pulls his vocal style or sharp wit, or to whom his  fans likely also listen. (There is a frame of a great album here, and  in the age of selective iTunes playlisting, maybe the regrettable  portion of the album is merely just forgettable.) This isn't Yelawolf's first foray into trying to make pop songs or songs for women, but it's by far his worst. His previous albums-- last year's <i>Trunk Muzik </i>and its repackaged follow-up <i>Trunk Muizk: 0-60--</i> showcased an ability and an affinity for pop songwriting that could've been fostered and encouraged here instead of being shelved for industry cast-offs.</p>
<p>And then there is ""Let's Roll"", the song with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2283-kid-rock/"" target=""_blank"">Kid Rock</a> that unexpectedly shows exactly how the formula can go right. Whether it equals pop success remains to be seen, but it's a collaboration that plays to both artists' strengths. As country boys at heart with an interest in both rap and rock, Yela and Kid Rock are arguably closer kindred spirits than Yela and Eminem, despite the tongue-twisting rapping. ""Let's Roll"" asks Rock to sing a conventional rap hook over a conventional rap beat, but the crux is in the grittiness and twang that Rock brings to the track, which dovetails perfectly with Yela's imagery of life as a rebel in Alabama. It's an inspired pairing, one that amounts to one of the best songs of Yelawolf's career, and it holds a mirror up to the four or five insipid crossover attempts that come later.</p></div>"|16092.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16092-radioactive/|6.5|Jordan Sargent

Smith's unwavering attitude casts over the faithful. There's no other sound like Smith's spittle-flecked snarl, and no other lyrical sensibility like his; he's never allowed the Fall to rest on its history, or its listeners to get too comfortable.</p>
<p>But that's not the same thing as saying that the Fall are incapable of <i>making</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> a bad record, and although a lot of their discography is difficult but rewarding, their 15,000th album </span><i>Ersatz G.B.</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s abrasiveness, inscrutability, and tedium are increasingly tough to take with repeated close listening. So it raises a couple of questions, such as: What would a total failure of a Fall album sound like, and how would that be different from this one? And what does it mean when it's impossible to tell a band's new record from a weak parody of what they've been up to for the past few years?</span></p>
<p>One way that the Fall <i>could</i> go wrong, for instance, if that were possible, would be for their music to fall off. Despite Smith's insistence that he's the only important member, he used to have bandmates who were distinctive musicians-- Brix, Steve Hanley, Marc Riley, the Mouse on Mars guys. These days, he has to work with musicians who will put up with what being in the Fall in the 21st century entails. The lineup on <i>Ersatz G.B.</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, as it happens, is the same as on the last couple of albums, but it could be yet another anonymous pickup crew-- and if you removed Smith's vocals from it, it would be a nearly irredeemable, almost totally generic hard rock record. The riff of ""Greenway"" is, in fact, copped from Greek comedy-metal band Anorimoi's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMKjU9HHtZs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gameboy""</a>, except that the current edition of the Fall doesn't have anything like Anorimoi's precision and bite.</span></p>
<p>And Smith? How could a record with him on it ever go entirely awry? Well, he's still Mark E. Smith-- there are always developments to follow. He's got a new voice he uses on a few songs, a death-rattle gargle-growl; as usual, there are a couple of WTF lyrical moments, especially ""Nate Will Not Return"", in which Smith sees how many rhymes he can force with the name of the <i>Gossip Girl</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> character. And there are still a few drops to be milked out of Smith's favorite tricks: mocking middlebrow culture, dragging ""un-songlike"" diction and fun-to-pronounce proper nouns into song lyrics, fracturing the meaning of a sentence mid-phrase. (One line in ""Mask Search"", possibly the best-enunciated on the album, does all of those things: ""I'm so sick of Snow Patrol/ And where to find Esso lubricant/ And mobile number."")</span></p>
<p>At this point, though, the band's music is so <i>pro forma</i> that most of his lyrics could be applied to any track here with no significant difference. ""I've Seen Them Come"" is an idea for an intriguing 20-second passage of a song, stretched out to an unbearable six minutes. ""Age of Chang"" features a tinny condenser-mic recording accompanied by the properly recorded band, which would be a clever idea if Smith hadn't already recorded <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAWHUa9AM1s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Paintwork""</a> more than 25 years ago. When ""Happi Song"" turns up halfway through, it's a relief to <i>not</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> hear Smith out front for a few minutes-- it's a sweet, simple tune written by keyboardist Eleni Poulou, and sung by her in a fragile, thickly accented voice (with Smith occasionally making unpleasant noises in the background).</span></p>
<p>If you believe the Fall are incapable of badness by virtue of their singularity, then here you go; Smith's Mancunian sneer will always raise a Pavlovian response for those of us who are used to its signaling genius. But hold this shabby, grueling album up next to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2979-hex-enduction-hour/"" target=""_blank"">Hex Enduction Hour</a></i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> or </span><i>Bend Sinister</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> or </span><i>The Marshall Suite</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> or any number of the great, challenging records the Fall made when they were challenging themselves, too, and it falls apart.</span></p></div>"|16081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16081-the-fall-ersatz-gb/|2.2|Douglas Wolk

It's really just another term for ""recipe"" or ""rules,"" and rules are what make particular types of music work the way they do. The blues is a formula. The sonata's a formula. And in house and techno, the four-to-the-floor kick is a formula, the one that makes it all click together like Legos. There are many such formulae in dance music; we could also just call them conventions. A lot of these conventions have to do with accommodating DJs, like 16-bar intros with little more than a steady kick and a hint of the tune to come, to facilitate mixing into the track that's finishing, or 16-bar outros that have been similarly thinned out to pave the way for the <i>next</i> succession of stepping stones.</p>
<p>Some formulae are less about the DJ than the listener, less functional than musically intuitive-- like a drum fill across the last few beats of the fourth bar, to send us hurtling into the next phrase, or a filter sweep at the end of a long breakdown, to build tension before the music returns at full power. These things can easily degenerate into cliché, as evidenced by the current crop of maximum-strength electro-house being flogged across stadium raves and super clubs, in which every functional trope is super-sized to the verge of self-parody. But in the hands of a producer like <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/rekid"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Radio Slave</a>, the formula becomes the material itself. The form becomes the content.</p>
<p>This is one of the main things you'll take away from <i>Works: Selected Remixes 2006-2010</i>, a collection of the Berlin-based producer Matt Edwards' remix work for artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4423-unkle/"" target=""_blank"">UNKLE</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4955-trentemller/"" target=""_blank"">Trentemøller</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19509-minilogue/"" target=""_blank"">Minilogue</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10842-roman-flugel/"" target=""_blank"">Roman Flügel</a>'s Soylent Green. It's an impressive-- some might say daunting-- collection. There are only 22 tracks, but with the average length of around 10 minutes, they take up three CDs and nearly four hours' listening time. As compilations go, the list of artists remixed suggests a wide stretch of stylistic ground: Edwards tackles not just the work of like-minded dance artists like Len Faki, Mr. G, and Peace Division but also winsome indie pop from Mlle Caro &amp; Franck Garcia and an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"" target=""_blank"">Arthur Russell</a> cover by alt-R&amp;B types Yam Who?. (Even the Cult's Ian Astbury wails his way into the mix, via UNKLE's ""Burn My Shadow"".)</p>
<p>But as disparate as the source material can be, a remarkable uniformity prevails across the remixes. As Radio Slave, Edwards essentially does one groove. (He explores other styles under aliases like Rekid, Cabin Fever, and the Machine, and in the duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5763-quiet-village/"" target=""_blank"">Quiet Village</a>.) It's a rolling, gliding, tech-house cadence built upon sturdy kick drums and immaculately carved hi-hats, so cleanly cut they might be a jeweler's work. It's the archetypal house groove, with shakers and hi-hats on the upbeats and claps on the 2 and 4; every new track feels like a variation upon the last. It's a formula, but Edwards is a master of tweaking the internal proportions, sliding elements forward or backward against the beat to give it a sense of swing. He threads ostinato tones through the upper register like a guy wire, a taut line arrowing off toward the horizon and from which every other element hangs. He favors dry claps and snares to accentuate the cavernous empty space between the beats, and the bass is more felt than heard: rarely could it be called a ""line,"" just the moody cushion on which everything nervously rests.</p>
<p>He deploys syncopated toms or chord stabs, often buried subliminally deep in the mix, to add even more tension. And he knows how to draw out a phrase for 16 or 32 bars, sketching broad arcs over rhythms that seem never to change, as though teasing the course of time itself. Virtually every track here, at once languid and tightly wound, is a master class in what makes this particular kind of groove tick. Across the 22 tracks, these tropes reappear so often that it's hard to tell whether they're tactics or tics. So I tried a little experiment.</p>
<p>I was inspired by something I found on SoundCloud the other day. Created by a Britsh artist named Paul Chivers (aka ramjac), it's called <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/ramjac/beatlescompletebkwds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All Together Now: Everything the Beatles Ever Did""</a>, and that's exactly what it is: ""Every Beatles tune, played together, sequenced in order of lengths, with the longest starting first and all 226 tunes ending together,"" as Chivers explains in his description. It begins with the familiar loops of ""Revolution 9"" and culminates in a maelstrom that might send <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2744-merzbow/"" target=""_blank"">Merzbow</a> running for cover. It's a neat conceptual joke, but it also says something about the proportions of the Beatles' own chosen forms, and the way they grew out of them.</p>
<p>I wanted to see how well Radio Slave's remixes conform to an ideal type, so I dragged all seven tracks from the first CD of <i>Works</i> into Ableton Live, a music-production and sequencing application. I changed the tempos of the individual tracks slightly so that the beats were lined up, all of them beginning together, and I hit ""Play."" The result sounded remarkably like one single track-- or, at most, a mixed passage in a DJ set, where both tracks are at full volume.</p>
<p>There are key clashes galore, but that's not the point-- what's striking is how perfectly all the rhythmic elements line up. And, beyond that, how closely the tracks mirror each other in structure, swelling and fading in lockstep. Voices from disparate songs-- Ian Astbury, Mlle Caro, the singer from Trentemøller's ""Moan""-- are teased in at roughly the same points in the composite track, a pile of codas upon codas. The fadeout is a uniform decrescendo. The shape of Edwards' ideal form burns like a filament in a dimly lit room. The results reminded me of <a href=""http://azurebumble.wordpress.com/2011/02/23/idris-khan-bernd-and-hilla-becher-works-photography/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Idris Khan's superimposed collages of the work of Bernd and Hilla Becher</a>, photographers obsessed with documenting archetypal architectural forms. All of that, and still: If you were at a club and heard this coming from the speakers, you'd probably think, ""Hm, a little busy, but it works.""</p>
<p>All of this isn't to reduce Radio Slave's remix work to a caricature-- quite the opposite. (Not everything on the compilation follows the pattern: ""Go Bang"", the Arthur Russell rework, is a glorious mess of unhinged disco, and Edwards' remix of Nelski's ""Body Pop"" pairs Latin pianos with dub chords to collapse New York's Body and Soul into Berlin's Panorama Bar-- a superimposition of a very different sort.) In fact, the experiment actually increased my appreciation for Edwards' craft. It's not easy to be this consistent without bogging down in old habits. No matter how formally similar each track may be, the best of them-- like his remixes of Soylent Green's ""La Forza Del Destino"", Matt O'Brien's ""Serotone"", and Mr. G's ""Sometimes I Cry""-- jump out of the speakers with rare intensity. You may not always be able to ID them, but if you've heard them on a dance floor, you know them in your bones.</p></div>"|16087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16087-works-selected-remixes-2006-2010/|6.9|Philip Sherburne

After all, this is a group that took five years to release its debut full-length album (<i><a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Bats/_/Daddy's+Highway"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daddy's Highway</a></i>) and is only now issuing its eighth record, <i>Free All the Monsters</i>. The long gaps in the Bats' catalog can partly be attributed to singer/guitarist Robert Scott's presence as bassist in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean/"">the Clean</a> and his intermittent work as a solo artist, including his excellent 2010 album, <i><a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Scott/Ends+Run+Together"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ends Run Together</a></i>. Remarkably, despite long periods of inactivity, the band's original lineup of Scott plus singer/guitarist Kaye Woodward, bassist Paul Kean, and drummer Malcolm Grant remains intact. So too does that dreamy, disconsolate feeling that settles in whenever the Bats' best music takes hold and nimbly seeps under your skin.</p>
<p>This relatively swift follow-up to 2008's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13122-the-guilty-office/"">The Guilty Office</a></i> reunites the group with <a href=""http://www.flyingnun.co.nz/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flying Nun</a> for the first time in over a decade, during a time when the legendary Christchurch label is celebrating its own 30th year in the business. It may be a stretch to imagine that realigning of forces caused the Bats to up their game, but this feels like their best record in years, possibly ever. <i>Free All the Monsters </i>simply consists of a set of plaintive songs that draw on all the stylistic cues this band has worked hard to establish in the past (a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"">Byrds</a>-ian jangle, a touch of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Velvets</a>-style dissonance) and tightens everything up a touch. Parallel feelings of warmth and longing criss-cross through much of the material, with songs like ""Long Halls"" and ""On the Bank"" bedded down in Kean's warmly looping basslines, while the vocals cut through the glow with a whole heap of self scrutiny.</p>
<p>Most bands that put in the kind of time the Bats have accrued, either in their natural lives or through reunions, are trading off past glories by the time they hit this awkward middle-age stage. The language of rock simply doesn't lend itself well to concerns that arise once temples start thinning and paunches start widening-- with a few notable exceptions. Scott, it seems, is one of those irregular musicians, someone who has grappled with the aging process and managed to filter his thoughts and feelings on it into compelling material. It helps that he's able to fasten his wistful mindset to a broad base of musical ideas, whether it's in the lilting pop of his co-vocal duties with Woodward on ""Free All the Monsters"" and ""Fingers of Dawn"" or through the meditative exhaust-fume growl of ""In the Subway"". On the beautifully barren instrumental ""Canopy"" there's no need for words, with the Bats overlapping, keening guitar lines that perfectly sink into the pensive undercurrent of the rest of the album.</p>
<p>The nostalgic ""Spacejunk"" works as a précis of the unusual place the Bats find themselves in, with Scott hinting at his malaise (""direction is hard to find"") and indicating how he gets over it (""time is the healer""). That notion of using time to overcome, to iron out kinks, not to rush into resolution or hasty decision-making is why this group has an album on their hands that effortlessly builds on everything that came before. It's an old-fashioned approach in the internet age, but it's better to think of the Bats as a band that's completely out of time, operating in a space (and at a pace) of its own volition. On <i>Free All the Monsters</i>, that place is full of familiar concerns-- woebegone angst, rumination on a life that could have turned out differently, the brutally quick passage of time. It's a bittersweet corner of the world that the Bats have patiently chipped away at over their long history, but on this record it feels like they're gaining a head of steam instead of resting on any laurels.</p></div>"|16093.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16093-free-all-the-monsters/|7.5|Nick Neyland

While the record wasn't reissued, exactly, <i>Big Bells</i>' unveiling was gradual-- which feels like a particularly appropriate beginning for Roberts, a deliberate and unhurried folk singer from Nashville.</p>
<p>On first listen, <i>Big Bells and Dime Songs</i> can seem slight-- Roberts' guitar and vocals aren't augmented by much, save the occasional snare, some bass, or a snippet of electric organ or piano-- but their sparseness only amplifies the record's pervasive, echoing sadness. <i>Big Bells</i> is preoccupied with failures, emotional or otherwise: These are faithless laments, dirges for the nights when your glass is empty and no one's coming over.</p>
<p>Roberts' vocals (which contain all the cackle of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"" target=""_blank"">J Mascis</a> and all the plaintiveness of Townes Van Zandt) are tender and bruised, and their smallness can be legitimately heartbreaking-- like on opener ""Somewhere to Run"", where Roberts blithely offers himself as a kind of last-call solace (""I'll be a hand to hold/ If I'm just a drunk who can't be true,"" he half-sings). Although folk music is frequently defined by its focus on narrative, Roberts' lyrics can be purposefully ambiguous, if not fully absurd (""I'm on a boat/ And if I only float,"" he announces in ""Unspotted Clothes""). Still, his oddball storytelling is unusually well-matched by his slow, methodical strums, and these songs move with purpose. The message is buried somewhere in all that empty space.</p>
<p>""Unspotted Clothes"" is the record's most unforgettable track, and also its most intricately arranged. <span> </span>Roberts gives each syllable its own tragic weight, while a bit of drum and piano complement his guitar; the results are wistful, mysterious. The lingering ""Epcot Women"" showcases Roberts' penchant for fingerpicking, with the crags of his voice providing a compelling counterpoint to the cleanness of his playing. There's only one misstep: ""Just Do It Blues"" contains a puzzling evocation (""Heavens to Betsy/ Nigger knocking at the door""), and if there's descriptive justification for the usage, it's not entirely self-evident here.</p>
<p>If pressed, Roberts might flash a few Americana bona-fides-- he was born in Nashville, but ran away from home to explore the U.S. via train, settling, for a while, in Brooklyn-- but unlike the bulk of the contemporary Americana canon, <i>Big Bells</i> is largely placeless. These songs are fiercely internal, which also makes them remarkably hard to shake-- here, Roberts is singing about the no-place of everyplace, the desolation we all know.</p></div>"|16090.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16090-big-bells-and-dime-songs/|7.5|Amanda Petrusich

With its classic-sounding jungle breaks and ragga vocal samples, opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12654-labyrinth/"" target=""_blank"">""Labyrinth""</a> immediately recalls Zomby's vaguely conceptual throwback debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12543-where-were-u-in-92/"" target=""_blank"">Where Were U in '92?</a>,</i> though drenched in noir melancholy. The breaks stutter and sputter, the perfunctory chord progression is oddly defeatist, and the characteristic airhorns are mockingly empty and peripheral: Breakbeat 'ardkore never sounded this tormented.</p>
<p>That's not to say <i>Nothing</i> isn't ever upbeat or danceable-- it's tinged with <i>Dedication</i>'s air of quiet, nocturnal introspection but not shackled by its thematic bent or album-oriented sequencing. Thus we get seven shades of Zomby, and even if they're basically different shades of gray, it's exciting to hear him branch out. He tries something new on the unusually dissolute ""Trapdoor"", where grainy synths billow over scattershot percussion that has more to do with footwork than Zomby's usual hardcore continuum. ""Digital Fractal"" and ""Equinox"" take the pseudo-garage bounce of older tracks like ""Tarantula"" and turn it somber in two different ways: ""Fractal"" plays with dulcet, mournful tones and shrouds its cycling arpeggios in reverb so they sound like they're off in the distance, lost in a fog, while the shimmering ""Equinox"" sucks that echo chamber dry, all crisply slicing snares and tactile hand percussion. It's a brilliant realism often missing from an artist whose work is expressed through glassy, artificial textures or borrowed tropes from extinct genres.</p>
<p>Those extinct genres make a determined comeback on <i>Nothing</i>, however, and Zomby's take on them is stronger than ever. ""Sens"" toys gently with its breaks, carefully placing them in the white space of a melody caught between jerky and jilted, and ""Ecstasy Versions"" transitions from a hesitant breakbeat crawler into full-on jungle. Even here, again Zomby's morose melodicism takes center stage, a track more about its sadly cooing vocals-- a common sample source sullied and sullen-- and bleepy melody than the flashy, distracting breaks that should be the center of attention. It's like he's proving once and for all that <i>Where Were U in '92?</i> wasn't just a transparent exercise, blending his hardcore copycat tracks with his more personal, idiosyncratic tendencies.</p>
<p>The <i>Nothing</i> EP was originally included as an appendage to the Japanese edition of <i>Dedication</i>, so it seems almost certain that these were leftovers from the album. But it says a lot about the strength of these tracks-- and Zomby's preternatural propensity for prolific greatness-- that the seven odds and sods on <i>Nothing</i> make for such a strong whole. It's not quite the sound of Zomby having fun-- this music is still too dark for that-- but it's Zomby being his usual tangential self again, after bearing the constraints of a second cohesive album. He <a href=""https://scribe.twitter.com/#!/ZombyMusic/status/139655052032884736"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently tweeted</a>: ""jungle is going to come back hard, mark my words, it might be five years from now but we will witness a new great age of jungle in England."" This sounds like the excitable mouthing-off of a delusional purist, but really, with visionary artists like Zomby behind a potential new wave of the stuff, it's hard not to wonder if he could be right.</p></div>"|16086.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16086-nothing/|7.5|Andrew Ryce

And yet, his talent lies not only in his unwavering ability to deconstruct the male ego, but also translating all that psychological tumult and turmoil into rapturous, crowd-pleasing live entertainment.   Debuting in 2000 with an album produced by UK downtempo dons Fila Brazillia, <a href=""http://www.thetwilightsingers.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Twilight Singers</a> were initially conceived as a low-key counterpoint to Dulli's more frenetic previous band, the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C26BI1kJdkk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Afghan Whigs</a>. But over the past decade, thanks to an ever-expanding and rotating cast of collaborators, Dulli has effectively built up the Twilight Singers into a more elaborate rendering of the Afghan Whigs' rock-noir vision, enhancing the cinematic quality of the Whigs' mid-1990s catalog and honoring their reputation for breathless, soul-revue style performances that go on for hours. By feeding Dulli's unsavory songbook through all manner of medleys, impromptu covers, and crowd-participation gambits, the Twilight Singers have essentially become the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">Bad Seeds</a> by way of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a>-- emotional devastation you can dance to.</p>
<p>All of which makes the Twilight Singers' first live album less of a stop-gap cash-grab than a long-overdue inevitability. And like the canonical, career-making concert documents of the 1970s, <i>Live in New York</i>-- recorded last May at Webster Hall, on a Friday the 13th-- works both as a super-fan keepsake and a gateway for newcomers into Dulli's dense discography. The carefully plotted presentation and weighty nature of Twilight Singers albums-- not to mention Dulli's unvarnished, raw rasp of a voice-- can make them a foreboding proposition for some, but <i>Live in New York </i>eases the entry process with a representative sampling of high points from the band's five albums (albeit, unsurprisingly, with a particular emphasis on this year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15121-dynamite-steps/"" target=""_blank"">Dynamite Steps</a></i>) while giving shine to a quality not often heard on the band's recordings-- Dulli's gregarious personality, which sees him eagerly playing the master of ceremonies to his own breakdown.</p>
<p>Though <i>Live in New York</i> spreads 21 songs over two CDs (the digital version features only 19), it shows that Dulli essentially works in three modes: swaggering, nocturnal rockers; desolate break-of-dawn ballads; and gradually intensifying epics that bridge the gap between the two. His gift as a performer thus lies in knowing when to deploy each. Unlike most live albums, <i>Live in New York</i>'s CD version presents a complete, unedited concert, but one with perfectly paced ebbs and flows, as songs are radically rearranged and/or grouped together into seamless mini-suites. Dulli is especially aware of how his various songs can complement or even bolster one another through association-- early on, the tension established by <i>Dynamite Steps</i>' slow-boiling ""Blackbird and the Fox"" explodes into a ferocious ""I'm Ready"" (off 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9007-powder-burns/"" target=""_blank"">Powder Burns</a></i>) as if they were two parts of the same song, while the set hits a fever pitch two-thirds in with raging revamps of ""Love"" and ""Annie Mae"" (from 2000's <i>Twilight as Played by the Twilight Singers</i>) that highlight the crucial role of Rick Nelson's piano-pounding and Greg Wieczorek's crashing drums to the band's widescreen sound.</p>
<p>Naturally, this mixtape approach to his own discography extends to Dulli's incorporating quotes from other artists' work. Dulli's no stranger to recontextualizing innocent pop songs for more devious ends-- ""Forty Dollars"" shrewdly swipes lines from the Beatles' ""She Loves You"" and ""All You Need Is Love"" to depict a transaction with a prostitute-- but in concert, this instinct goes into overdrive, whether it's using Carl Carlton's 1970s soul classic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uozA4PQwYl0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Everlasting Love""</a> as the closing refrain on ""Esta Noche"" or dropping <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWgvGjAhvIw&amp;ob=av3e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hey Ya!""</a>-inspired ""I'm just being honest"" ad libs in ""Forty Dollars"" (not to mention a snippet of the Whigs' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF93OC0lvJE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rebirth of the Cool""</a> on ""Never Seen No Devil""). Partway through <i>Live In New York</i>, Dulli even interrupts one cover song (Martina Topley-Bird's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50c-KsLhEjI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Too Tough to Die""</a>, which is available only on the CD version) to start another, as he slinks into the audience to lead a mass, off-mic sing-along of Tom Petty's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8o_GEfCptE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Breakdown""</a>. Compared to Dulli's other acts of reappropriation, the Petty theft initially seems less purposeful, and more like frivolous, crowd-baiting shtick. But, in hearing how quickly the audience picks up on Dulli's lead, it ultimately provides a perfect snapshot of how, at a Twilight Singers show, one man's anguish can so easily be elevated into communal, celebratory catharsis.</p></div>"|16083.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16083-the-twilight-singers/|8.0|Stuart Berman

Switch: It sounds more appropriate for the <i>holiday season</i>, as opposed to the winter. Though there's incontrovertible proof that Wolf is long past trying to recreate the shadowy allure of his first two LPs, I gotta admit to hoping he'd bundle up in black again to at least reconcile his pop impulses with the gothic, brooding exaggerations of his youth. For the most part, <i>Brumalia</i>-- which translates to ""festival of the shortest day""-- does let some blustery weather in, but sonically, it's on par with <i>Lupercalia </i>and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13067-the-bachelor/"" target=""_blank"">The Bachelor</a>, </i>so it's not barren trees and howling winds so much as ostentatious Christmas light fixtures in the pure, driven snow.</p>
<p>Whereas <i>Lupercalia</i> was inspired by the giddiness of a real-life romantic partnership, Wolf sidesteps straight biography to reacquaint himself with instruments, samples, and memories he literally found lying around: A long-dormant theremin seeps through the stately pulse of ""Bitten"", the percussion underpinning ""Nemoralia"" is cobbled together from news footage of London's summer riots, the words of ""Jerusalem"" were adapted from William Blake, while the confessional lyrics of ""Trust"" are straight from Wolf's diary. Though they're as lavishly produced as his proper records, the little sonic footnotes and specificity give <i>Brumalia </i>a demo-level, real-time immediacy that rarely comes through despite his gregarious persona.</p>
<p>Problem is that it begs the question of how exactly to evaluate the positive effects of Wolf's over-sharing: Does prior knowledge of <i>Brumalia</i>'s themes and history somehow lessen the value of its contents without it? Perhaps, since rather than using its brevity as a means of cohesion, <i>Brumalia </i>finds Wolf with a batch of songs unsure of what impression it wants to leave-- other than being a sonic appendage to <i>Lupercalia</i>, itself an uneven record. That said, ""Together"" is helped by its new context-- previously, its plainspoken hook (""And I can do this alone/ But we can do this so much better... together"") felt like just another example of Wolf laying it on too thick, but amidst<i> Brumalia</i>'s facially darker lyrical content, its contentment at least <i>feels </i>a bit more earned and its opulent disco pulse more striking. Meanwhile, a see-sawing violin riff and an empathetic appraisal of addiction make ""Bitten"" as instantly ingratiating as recent Wolf singles such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12095-the-city/"" target=""_blank"">""The City""</a> or ""Accident &amp; Emergency"" without the unctuous salesmanship.</p>
<p>But like <i>Lupercalia</i>, an auspicious and cohesive start gives way to Wolf sitting uneasily between the poles of his nocturnal mood-setting and major-key wooing. ""Pelicans"" is novel enough as Wolf's first iPad composition as well as a song with an overtly American geography, but without the occasional landmark, it's as turgid as the Florida swamps serving as its inspiration. Meanwhile, centerpiece ""This Time of Year"" goes further into Kevin Rowland fixation, but by trying to double as a Christmas card and an anti-war protest, Wolf's pen strains way too hard to purple up lyrics like ""How many crosses more must we stigmata our soil with/ Until we reveal the blood on our hands?""</p>
<p>And yet, Wolf still remains at least theoretically fascinating <i>because </i>he tries too hard, his artistic stumbles more often revealing a misdirection of ambition and talent than limitations. But is it just a matter of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8774-wind-in-the-wires/"" target=""_blank"">Wind in the Wires</a> </i>diehards not getting what <i>they</i> want? It's not that simple: Like <i>Lupercalia</i>,<i> Brumalia</i> uses Wolf's own experience to craft something that's more sonically and thematically universal. And yet, these supposed tensions don't end up feeling particularly <i>tense</i> or rife with possibility like Wolf's best work. As such, <i>Brumalia </i>ends up being as frustrating as his previous albums because Wolf appears capable of giving us anything to the point where comfort is not enough.</p></div>"|16091.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16091-brumalia-ep/|5.9|Ian Cohen

Given the facts that generally circulate about Minerva, aka Maria Juur-- she studied cultural theory, she is interested in deconstructing ideas about female sexuality, <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2011/11/11/what-were-reading-maria-minerva/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she reads books</a>-- it's easy to imagine that the fourth track on her new </span><i>Sacred &amp; Profane Love</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> EP, ""Another Time and Place"", takes its name from a semi-obscure philosophical tract, à la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5687-john-maus/"" target=""_blank"">John Maus</a>' </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15596-we-must-become-the-pitiless-censors-of-ourselves/"" target=""_blank"">We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves</a></i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. Actually, it's Britney Spears. Over the track's pulsating, murky beat, Maria lifts a question Spears posed in 2001's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzybwwf2HoQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'm a Slave 4 U""</a>: ""Baby, don't you wanna dance up on me/ Until another time and place?"" </span><i>Sacred &amp; Profane Love</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is Minerva's most immediate release yet, but it picks up on her other records' ideas: Her music is a place where academia and pop culture, tastefulness and excess, dominance and submission, and yes, </span>Hélène Cixous<span style=""font-style: normal;""> and Britney Spears, all commingle in a hazy, libidinous swirl.</span></p>
<p>The EP's centerpiece is the terrific <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12622-gloria/"" target=""_blank"">""Gloria""</a>, a hypnagogic earworm about corporeal and spiritual bliss: ""Darling, when you touch me/ I feel like I've been touched by the hands of God."" Lest the title deceive you, know that we're a long way from Patti Smith's gravely barroom stomp: This ""Gloria"" swoons and ripples like a reflection in water. Another clear highlight is ""Turn Me On (Working on Full Powwa)"", which features a playful, muffled vocal and a driving beat. The bookends ""A Love So Strong"" and the closing reprise ""Luv So Strong"" aren't quite as compelling but they add a cohesion to the EP's atmosphere, making <i>Sacred &amp; Profane</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> feel like an ecstatic, 30-minute journey to another time and place-- one that makes even familiar pop lyrics distend like musings on power relations and time travel.</span></p>
<p>Minerva's music remains rough around the edges, and some listeners might wish she'd appropriate the clarity of the more mainstream pop that inspires her-- but that's clearly not her aim. ""I'm exploring the idea of the 'female loser,'"" <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/arts/music/female-artists-with-a-penchant-for-synth-sounds.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Minerva has said</a> about her conceptual approach. You get the feeling you've heard Taylor Swift or the dude behind <a href=""http://www.lg15.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LonelyGirl15</a> say the exact same thing, but what's so refreshing about Minerva's sound-- along with that of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29681-us-girls/"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Girls</a>, who are also using DIY dance music to make comments about femininity and alienation in the digital age-- is that it bespeaks a sense of isolation and anxiety that feels refreshingly, and even unsettlingly, authentic. Still, even though it's true to her aesthetic, <i>Sacred &amp; Profane Love</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> certainly feels like a progression. It's the first of her releases on which the impulse to think or feel takes a backseat-- more than anything this is a record that wants to see you move.</span></p></div>"|16079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16079-maria-minerva-sacred-profane-love-ep/|7.1|Lindsay Zoladz

At their absolute worst, these self-published albums are tin-eared things (and invariably tied to local parishes). A select few-- like the kind of Midwest soul and funk oddities that the mindful reissue Numero label constantly unearths-- are redeemable listens. Yet only a few private-press records ever offer portals into alternate realities.</p>
<p>That west coast Yoga Records imprint mostly dabbles in the latter, be it <i>Traveler's Advisory</i>, the beguiling hammer dulcimer-drum machine album from Matthew Young or Ted Lucas' lonesome and stoned folk album. So it's no question that the peculiar strain of heavy metal that Duane Warr recorded to a Tascam eight-track in 1984 while living inside his trailer in Columbia, South Carolina, is a portal to another realm. Dwarr, the one-man band of Warr's, goes to a dark alley in the psyche that few ever feel the need to wander, much less record and overdub-- crafting hand-drawn album art as well as homemade videos for certain songs (not to mention pressing up and distributing, only to be unable to sell them). Warr home-recorded and self-released both 1984's oddly-titled debut <i>Starting Over</i> and 1986's <i>Animals</i>, before a divorce and spiritually harrowing time led to a breakdown and to Warr's becoming a born-again Christian.</p>
<p>With a continued fascination with Norwegian black metal, it makes sense that a rarity such as Dwarr should blip back for recent metal converts. Last year, Yoga (in conjunction with Drag City) re-released <i>Animals</i>, which, despite having a cannibal-populated landscape for a cover, sank without much fanfare. Now follows <i>Starting Over</i>, which is, alas, the weaker of the two albums. Dwarr's records are harrowing experiences, both in their tone and listenability, but despite a visual and aural aspect that seems to forecast doom and black metal, Dwarr never feels quite that dark and depraved. Despite what it predicts for the future of metal, it's genealogy still consists of Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, <i>Tarkus</i>, and Black Sabbath.</p>
<p>From the looks of <i>Starting Over</i>-- whose cover art exists somewhere between <i>Planet of the Apes</i>' Statue of Liberty, <i>The Shining</i>'s flood of blood, and whatever that hesher in your high school art class used to always draw on looseleaf-- this should be an evil, teenage suicide-enabling shredder record of the highest echelon. Only, in the greater scheme of things, Dwarr's music isn't like that. While electric guitar shredding is the focus, this isn't satanic, apocalyptic doom heavy metal-- in its weird warped way, it's Christian folk.</p>
<p>The greatest example of Dwarr and his particular kind of genius can be found in <a href=""http://youtu.be/-79yPTbH3lE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the video he shot and edited himself</a> for ""Screams of Terror"", the second song on <i>Starting Over</i>. It conveys his gifts more than making the music can. What else can be genuinely campy and haunting, then campy again, but then bone-chilling by video's end? ""You know you're going straight to hell/ And if you don't straighten your life/ You'll have an endless plight,"" Warr intones on the lugubrious, doorbell-chimed tune, delivering his lyrics in that portentous Roger Waters whisper. Its early lines invoke that dread children feel in the dark, but Warr's lyrics ultimately veer towards a pat Christian morality, despite the monsters and skull paint. Even if at this phase of his life he's only into the damnation and sulfur parts of <i>the Bible</i>, returning to his religion seems inevitable in hindsight.</p>
<p>He cites the Book of Job directly on the brooding ""Job's Revenge"", though ""brooding"" isn't much of a descriptor when it could describe every aspect of the music. Here he reads from Job 5:2-9 during breaks from a 12-bar blues melody with a rote guitar solo on top. Too often, Warr delivers his lines and plays his parts without much variance. The best moments of the album come when Warr is at his most overt in his worship of Black Sabbath (rather than trying to conjure the ghost of Randy Rhoads via his Eddie Van Halen splatter guitar), as he does on ""Cannabinol: the Elation"". Only on furious closer ""I've Been Thinking"", where Warr's guitar cops the ""Sweet Leaf"" power chords and Ozzy's strangulated voice can one imagine a world where a heavy metal god isn't turned into a reality show punchline.</p></div>"|16088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16088-starting-over/|5.9|Andy Beta

Only by the terms of your original premise, mind you, which promised to be the sort of multimedia, multi-platform, multi-everything project that seemed like a real good idea circa Y2K. The novelty of the core Gorillaz gimmick-- an edgy, anime <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banana_Splits"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Banana Splits</a> that gave interviews in character and played high-tech projection live shows in place of their creators, Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett-- wore off sometime around the group's third video. But in a surprise upset, Gorillaz have evolved into something more than a cartoon prank or a circus-of-stars side-project, instead becoming the most effective achievement of Albarn's post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"" target=""_blank"">Blur</a> career.</p>
<p>Though a singles collection in 2011 is as anachronistic as the DVD-ROMs in the early Gorillaz back catalog, this one makes an excellent case for the substance behind the expired high concept of the <span> </span>""virtual band."" The decade covered here marked a mercurial time for Albarn, who celebrated the hiatus of Blur by eagerly shooting off in a dozen different directions. It was almost as though he set out to tick off every clichéd solo career path simultaneously: jamming melodica with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12435-welcome-to-mali/"" target=""_blank"">musicians in Mali</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43850-damon-albarns-congo-lp-revealed/"" target=""_blank"">the Congo</a>, creating a remixer persona, putting together his fantasy-dub supergroup <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27585-the-good-the-bad-the-queen/"" target=""_blank"">the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen</a>, and exploring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42905-watch-damon-albarn-perform-apple-carts-a-song-from-his-new-opera-idoctor-deei/"" target=""_blank"">opera</a> and film scoring.</p>
<p>Gorillaz is far and away the most successful of these projects at the cash register, selling millions of records worldwide, headlining Glastonbury and Coachella, and holographically sharing a Grammys stage with Madonna. The group's artistic success has also kept pace with its commercial success, giving Albarn a way to combine most of his musical distractions into an oddly cohesive whole.<span> </span>In retrospect, the key to the project may have been enabling Albarn to abandon the frontman role and become the man behind the curtain, both figuratively and (up until recent live shows) literally. If you don't think that hiding place isn't therapeutic for Albarn, consider that <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/828-think-tank/"" target=""_blank"">Think Tank</a></i>, the 2003 Blur album that essentially became an Albarn solo joint, also attempted to blend all of these interests, to less satisfying results.</p>
<p>Taking the greatest-hits route through Gorillaz's career, it's impressive how few of the tracks sound dated. Genre-free zones were all the rage in 2001, with many groups aiming for futuristic blends of hip-hop, electronic, pop, and rock that sounded past their sell-by within a year. But apart from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2272-deltron-3030/"" target=""_blank"">Deltron 3030</a> sequel of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRlmM88zzbY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rock the House""</a> and the tacky remixes filling out this collection's runtime, even the earliest Gorillaz singles have avoided the erosion to retro.</p>
<p>Credit an inspirational assist to Hewlett: His music-cliché characters may not have been able to sustain a satire or a storyline, but his trademark post-apocalyptic techno-dread was a suitable environmental muse for the urban <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"" target=""_blank"">Morricone</a> that became the Gorillaz formula. And a surprisingly flexible formula it turned out to be, able to assimilate guest appearances as varied as the artisan-rap of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1028-de-la-soul/"" target=""_blank"">De La Soul</a>, the garble of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7521-shaun-ryder/"" target=""_blank"">Shaun Ryder</a>, and the elder croon of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10286-bobby-womack/"" target=""_blank"">Bobby Womack</a>.

<p>Lil B is in open-hearted truth-teller mode on <i>Velli</i>: there are no gangsta-rap or pimp-rap exercises.

<p><i>Silent President</i> is less rewarding and more scattershot  than <i>BasedGod Velli</i>. The beat selection and production are lower in quality, and B's real-time fumbling for words occasionally grows outright distracting.

<p>But whatever you think of <i>King Night, </i>the album is still the definitive version of the often imitated sound that Salem brought on the scene. The proper full-length follow-up to <i>King Night</i> is due some time in 2012, and there have been rumors that Salem are pursuing a different direction for the record; the band's latest EP, <i>I'm Still in the Night</i>, carries no indication that they're trying to branch out.</p>
<p>True to its title, the four-track EP mostly feels like a collection of songs that didn't make the LP's cut. <i>I'm Still in the Night</i> is more polished in terms of production, from the clipped howls that open the EP to the acid-rain synths of ""Baby Ratta"", and it includes a seven-minute cover of electronic pop collective <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dBu5X3TvNw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alice DeeJay's immortal 1998 trance anthem ""Better Off Alone""</a>. The cover doesn't come close to matching the original (what does?), but there's something perversely appealing about Salem draping a simplistic ""why won't you give your love to me"" anthem in their own dingy, smirking, loner outlook. Mercifully, Salem forgo Jack Donoghue's mush-mouthed rapping until <i>I'm Still in the Night</i>'s closing track, ""Krawl"", which finds him rambling about Slurpees, global warming, and how ""your bitch, she could suck a dick for me."" True to form, it's repugnant on any number of levels.</p>
<p>So, loud synths, eye-roll-inducing rapping, and more clattering drum machines than you'd find on a footwork compilation-- yes, <i>I'm Still in the Night</i> is more of the same. If you follow along enough to check it out, it offers a predictable mix of what they do well and where they go wrong, but it's also easy to ignore. Which, for a band that thrives on controversy, is a sign of trouble.</p></div>"|16085.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16085-im-still-in-the-night-ep/|6.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

Charlie and Ira Louvin devised the concept for the artwork themselves and set everything up in an old quarry, cutting Satan from Charlie's son's miniature train table and filling old tires with kerosene to simulate Hell. Then, as if on some Biblical cue, it began to rain, so their poses were hurried and awkward so their white suits wouldn't get drenched. Still, as silly as it may be, there's something curious about that image, especially that folk art figure looming in the background, bucktoothed and cross-eyed. It doesn't look professional or polished, which fits the music: The Louvin Brothers may have been signed to Capitol, but like so many other rural artists who never settled comfortably into either secular or gospel, they still sound both compellingly raw and incredibly sophisticated.</p>
<p><i>Satan Is Real</i> is the duo's best-known record, not only for its cover but for songs like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUJZwmgqAII"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Christian Life""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy9GCWirmas"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Kneeling Drunkard's Plea""</a>, famously covered by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"" target=""_blank"">the Byrds</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Cash</a>, respectively. Will Ferrell even incorporated the title track into his one-man show, <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386011/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You're Welcome, America: A Final Night with George W. Bush</a></i>. The album represents a shift from secular to religious music after several years away, and yet the Louvin Brothers weren't necessarily trading one for the other. Like Johnny Cash or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22874-elvis-presley/"" target=""_blank"">Elvis Presley</a>, they blended popular and church music to amplify the qualities of the other. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sunO2hmFoUY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""There's a Higher Power""</a> snaps back and forth in a spirited call and response, but it's the shuffling snare that drive those exultant shouts of ""Amen!"" Similarly, the piano that pushes <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W4-UfQasSs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The River of Jordan""</a> along its freighted path belongs more to the barrelhouse than the revival tent.</p>
<p>The Louvin Brothers, despite being brothers and such naturalistic harmonizers, were spiritually and temperamentally mismatched, which may explain the equal emphasis they placed on darkness and light. Charlie adhered strictly to the message of these songs and was likely the guiding force behind <i>Satan Is Real</i>, but Ira was an angry drunk who routinely smashed mandolins on stage and showed up late to concerts. He was shot twice by a wife who claimed he beat her, and he allegedly tried to strangle Presley, whose big beat Ira saw as an affront to country music. Those extremes reflected in their music, at least until Charlie broke up the act and, in a grim irony, Ira was killed by a drunk driver in 1965.</p>
<p>Their entire catalog devises a seemingly contradictory mix of the holy and the worldly, the sacred and the profane. How could an act that revels in ""The Christian Life"" turn around and sing a dire murder ballad like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhMiKeSffns"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Knoxville Girl""</a>, whose grisly details still provoke winces even half a century after they sang it? To the Louvins' understanding, man's boundless capacity for sin matched his boundless capacity for salvation, so they weren't simply going to nudge you along the righteous path; they were going to run you off the highway to hell. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czLceBSD7Cc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Satan Is Real""</a> sets the tone and the churchly tableau, as the brothers harmonize on a hymnal chorus before Charlie interrupts with a monologue reminiscent of Hank Williams' <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Williams#1950s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Luke the Drifter</a> homilies. ""You can hear him in the songs that give praise to idols and sinful things of this world,"" he declares of the devil. ""You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart."" It's a scare tactic, yet the brothers' precise vocals and Ira's always agile picking lends the song an urgency and gravity, as though they might be that deeply invested in their listeners' faith.</p>
<p>These songs may kill off dear mothers, struggling drunkards, debased sinners, and even innocent little babies, but <i>Satan Is Real</i> somehow conveys jubilation rather than penance, which is likely what inspired 60s country rockers like the Byrds and the Dillards and continues to bear on so many artists today. To that end, Light in the Attic is jointly issuing <i>Handpicked Songs</i><i> 1955-1962</i>, a compilation of Louvin Brothers songs chosen by musicians representing several generations: Dolly Parton, Chris Hillman, and Kris Kristofferson, as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2880-my-morning-jacket/"" target=""_blank"">Jim James</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4553-m-ward/"" target=""_blank"">M. Ward</a>, among others. On CD, the sets are packaged together; on vinyl, they're available separately (there's also a vinyl-only reissue of their 1956 LP <i>Tragic Songs of Life</i>).</p>
<p>Sonically, vinyl is the better option, but musically, the 2xCD edition provides a better introduction to the Louvin Brothers. Perhaps because it's set so irremovably in the church, <i>Satan Is Real</i> may not be their most accessible album, which means <i>Handpicked Songs</i> makes for a livelier complement than outtakes or live performances and allows for a secular counterpart to the sacred music. It reaches beyond their hits to unearth some deeper catalog cuts like the spry ""Low and Lonely"" (chosen by Jim James) and the loping ""Scared of the Blues"" (chosen by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"" target=""_blank"">Devendra Banhart</a>), which reveal the scope of their songwriting, the agility of Ira's mandolin playing, and the exuberance of their keening harmonies. Especially for an album produced by committee, <i>Handpicked</i> argues persuasively for the Louvins' relevance long after rock'n'roll supposedly rendered their music obsolete.

Charlie and Ira Louvin devised the concept for the artwork themselves and set everything up in an old quarry, cutting Satan from Charlie's son's miniature train table and filling old tires with kerosene to simulate Hell. Then, as if on some Biblical cue, it began to rain, so their poses were hurried and awkward so their white suits wouldn't get drenched. Still, as silly as it may be, there's something curious about that image, especially that folk art figure looming in the background, bucktoothed and cross-eyed. It doesn't look professional or polished, which fits the music: The Louvin Brothers may have been signed to Capitol, but like so many other rural artists who never settled comfortably into either secular or gospel, they still sound both compellingly raw and incredibly sophisticated.</p>
<p><i>Satan Is Real</i> is the duo's best-known record, not only for its cover but for songs like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUJZwmgqAII"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Christian Life""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy9GCWirmas"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Kneeling Drunkard's Plea""</a>, famously covered by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"" target=""_blank"">the Byrds</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Cash</a>, respectively. Will Ferrell even incorporated the title track into his one-man show, <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386011/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You're Welcome, America: A Final Night with George W. Bush</a></i>. The album represents a shift from secular to religious music after several years away, and yet the Louvin Brothers weren't necessarily trading one for the other. Like Johnny Cash or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22874-elvis-presley/"" target=""_blank"">Elvis Presley</a>, they blended popular and church music to amplify the qualities of the other. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sunO2hmFoUY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""There's a Higher Power""</a> snaps back and forth in a spirited call and response, but it's the shuffling snare that drive those exultant shouts of ""Amen!"" Similarly, the piano that pushes <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W4-UfQasSs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The River of Jordan""</a> along its freighted path belongs more to the barrelhouse than the revival tent.</p>
<p>The Louvin Brothers, despite being brothers and such naturalistic harmonizers, were spiritually and temperamentally mismatched, which may explain the equal emphasis they placed on darkness and light. Charlie adhered strictly to the message of these songs and was likely the guiding force behind <i>Satan Is Real</i>, but Ira was an angry drunk who routinely smashed mandolins on stage and showed up late to concerts. He was shot twice by a wife who claimed he beat her, and he allegedly tried to strangle Presley, whose big beat Ira saw as an affront to country music. Those extremes reflected in their music, at least until Charlie broke up the act and, in a grim irony, Ira was killed by a drunk driver in 1965.</p>
<p>Their entire catalog devises a seemingly contradictory mix of the holy and the worldly, the sacred and the profane. How could an act that revels in ""The Christian Life"" turn around and sing a dire murder ballad like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhMiKeSffns"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Knoxville Girl""</a>, whose grisly details still provoke winces even half a century after they sang it? To the Louvins' understanding, man's boundless capacity for sin matched his boundless capacity for salvation, so they weren't simply going to nudge you along the righteous path; they were going to run you off the highway to hell. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czLceBSD7Cc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Satan Is Real""</a> sets the tone and the churchly tableau, as the brothers harmonize on a hymnal chorus before Charlie interrupts with a monologue reminiscent of Hank Williams' <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Williams#1950s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Luke the Drifter</a> homilies. ""You can hear him in the songs that give praise to idols and sinful things of this world,"" he declares of the devil. ""You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart."" It's a scare tactic, yet the brothers' precise vocals and Ira's always agile picking lends the song an urgency and gravity, as though they might be that deeply invested in their listeners' faith.</p>
<p>These songs may kill off dear mothers, struggling drunkards, debased sinners, and even innocent little babies, but <i>Satan Is Real</i> somehow conveys jubilation rather than penance, which is likely what inspired 60s country rockers like the Byrds and the Dillards and continues to bear on so many artists today. To that end, Light in the Attic is jointly issuing <i>Handpicked Songs</i><i> 1955-1962</i>, a compilation of Louvin Brothers songs chosen by musicians representing several generations: Dolly Parton, Chris Hillman, and Kris Kristofferson, as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2880-my-morning-jacket/"" target=""_blank"">Jim James</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4553-m-ward/"" target=""_blank"">M. Ward</a>, among others. On CD, the sets are packaged together; on vinyl, they're available separately (there's also a vinyl-only reissue of their 1956 LP <i>Tragic Songs of Life</i>).</p>
<p>Sonically, vinyl is the better option, but musically, the 2xCD edition provides a better introduction to the Louvin Brothers. Perhaps because it's set so irremovably in the church, <i>Satan Is Real</i> may not be their most accessible album, which means <i>Handpicked Songs</i> makes for a livelier complement than outtakes or live performances and allows for a secular counterpart to the sacred music. It reaches beyond their hits to unearth some deeper catalog cuts like the spry ""Low and Lonely"" (chosen by Jim James) and the loping ""Scared of the Blues"" (chosen by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"" target=""_blank"">Devendra Banhart</a>), which reveal the scope of their songwriting, the agility of Ira's mandolin playing, and the exuberance of their keening harmonies. Especially for an album produced by committee, <i>Handpicked</i> argues persuasively for the Louvins' relevance long after rock'n'roll supposedly rendered their music obsolete. Even at a time when so many church-bred artists were exploring more worldly markets, the struggle between salvation and damnation has rarely sounded so lively or so gloriously conflicted.</p></div>"|15972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15972-satan-is-real-handpicked-songs-1955-1962/|8.5|Stephen M.

He's left his mark in small doses on Madlib-produced tracks-- Lootpack's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHNDPICwgA0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Level Zero""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrg6OBu25F0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wanna Test""</a>; Quasimoto's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM14plaXLFM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""24-7""</a>; Madvillain's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weWTuvdL-LQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Raid""</a>-- but his 2005 full-length debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5652-push-comes-to-shove/"" target=""_blank"">Push Comes to Shove</a></i> revealed his limitations in short order. He's never been the most distinguishable member of the Stones Throw camp, for good or for bad: The same thing that's kept him from setting himself apart has also generally kept him from the embarrassments that happen when an MC's ambition outstrips his inspiration. He just punches the clock, drops in for 14 tracks, then punches out again, rapping like a man who keeps his head down and just goes through the motions, as though doing otherwise would get him fired.</p>
<p>That the title is the most egregious thing about <i>Classic</i> is something of a minor relief, though it's also a good way to bait critics looking for something else to say about an album without much personality to it. (I'll bite: ""more like <i>Adequate</i>."") The usual themes come up in his lyrics-- sex (""JWF""), weed (""Medical Card""), regional pride (""Where I'm From"")-- and the common universality of his experiences and perspectives on these well-worn topics are relatable at the expense of being actually unique. Occasionally he'll hit on something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1542-blaxican/"" target=""_blank"">""Blaxican""</a>, which conflates the parallel civil rights struggles in his background, and leaves you wondering just what more he might have to say outside the confines of his indistinct lyrical style.</p>
<p>But it's M.E.D.'s emphasis on technique over everything else that holds this album back. His voice is largely flat and affectless, letting the words do all the work of selling an attitude that should otherwise come through in inflections. And those words don't carry enough weight on their own; there's so much reliance on internal rhymes and assonance in his style that he's sacrificed being quotable for being listenable. But he's at least got a delivery that fuses well to the beat and doesn't get in the way of the production enough to detract from it-- sometimes, it's the other way around, as when a sampled vocal drop on closer ""Magical Mystical"" actually drowns him out mid-verse. (By that point, it's hard to feel like you've missed something.)</p>
<p>In situations like this, it's best to approach an album at this level as a sort of beat tape with added vocal augmentation. A lot of <i>Classic</i>'s appeal comes from the heavy Madlib involvement, and his productions here work well as a tidied-up take on the resin-caked density of his latter-day Medicine Show and Beat Konducta entries. The Tesla-coil keyboards of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27914-kurupt/"" target=""_blank"">Kurupt</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28655-planet-asia/"" target=""_blank"">Planet Asia</a>-featuring subwoofer anthem ""Roll Out"" and the stripped-down, dirtied-up drums on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29241-hodgy-beats/"" target=""_blank"">Hodgy Beats</a> collab ""Outta Control"" are key highlights. For good measure you can throw in a tension-building violin-tinged <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6765-the-alchemist/"" target=""_blank"">Alchemist</a> beat on ""War &amp; Love"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3211-oh-no/"" target=""_blank"">Oh No</a> delivering no-bullshit choppy organ funk on ""Where I'm From"", Karriem Riggins wringing some nice belated summer vibes off the jazz guitar-driven title track, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4763-georgia-anne-muldrow/"" target=""_blank"">Georgia Anne Muldrow</a> injecting her eccentric but richly realized neo-soul sensibility into ""INT'L"". It's another solid case study in what makes the Stones Throw aesthetic so appealing to the traditionalist-meets-futurist indie-rap crossover crowd. That sound just has a lot of blanks to fill in: The MC shortened his name from Medaphor to an acronym a long time ago, but it's still not clear whether M.E.D. actually stands for anything.</p></div>"|16076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16076-med-classic/|6.1|Nate Patrin

Like no one before him, Corgan made those influences work. As Canadian writer Jennifer Nine once put it in <i>Melody Maker</i>, you got a sense that he was the kind of guy who worked out every last transcription from <i>Guitar Player</i> in the 1980s and then actually did something with it. It helped that the rest of the band had their own skills, especially in the case of Jimmy Chamberlin, a jazz/hard-rock drum freak let loose on alt-rock radio.</p>
<p>Alt-rock radio, at its height of commercial trendsetting, enabled the Pumpkins to not merely survive but thrive. There, Corgan could have his cake and eat it too, daring people to get annoyed at his starlust and reacting in kind while further building up his ambitions. He got his band signed to a major label and used the fig leaf of a corporate indie release for <i>Gish</i>, scored a prime spot on the Seattle-focused <i>Singles</i> soundtrack with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mn-3EqaO0E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Drown""</a>, essentially went ""Haters gonna hate"" with <i>Siamese Dream</i>'s first single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KE9lvU810"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cherub Rock""</a>, and got petulant when any other acts or writers accused him of protesting too much. And not just <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a>, either: ""You hurt me deeply in my heart,"" he once <a href=""http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/articles/spin_4-94.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">infamously pouted to Kim Thayil</a> before a 1994 Australian concert, following which the Pumpkins went on ""to play the best set anybody has ever heard them play.""</p>
<p>All of which goes some distance toward explaining why both reissues of <i>Gish</i> and <i>Siamese Dream</i>-- appropriately loaded with rarities, DVD bonuses, fancy packaging, and often-impressionistic song-for-song liner notes by Corgan-- remain remarkable though unequal listens. Even in 1991, <i>Gish</i> felt like something that started off well with songs like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3wAtWywrP4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Siva""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVfWx9282y0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rhinoceros""</a> but meandered a bit toward the end. Corgan's voice never sounded as lost in his music as it does here, and most of the emphasis is on the band's collective performance: Chamberlin's powerful, fluid drumming, Darcy Wretzky's strong basslines, and that thick, chunky glaze of guitars.</p>
<p>The rarities disc contains a few never-before-heard numbers, a few that have long circulated among fanatics (the Corgan-sung version of ""Daydream"" is a keeper), and a handful of remixed selections (including their best full-on rock epic, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnFeCex032g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Starla""</a>) that first surfaced on a full-length release via the odds-and-ends release <i>Pisces Iscariot</i>. These tracks do a better job of showcasing the band's various sonic sides than <i>Gish</i> itself. The DVD, a multi-camera cut from a live show at the Metro in Chicago almost a year prior to <i>Gish</i>'s release, shows that the band already had their exact arrangements pretty well down, as well as a worshipping fanbase. The highlights include Corgan and James Iha's heavily long hair, curious fashion choices all around, and set-closing covers of Steppenwolf and Blue Öyster Cult; the video quality is pretty good and the sound mix, if heavily favoring the vocals, beats out most bootlegs of the time.</p>
<p>In contrast to <i>Gish</i>'s steady flow, <i>Siamese Dream</i> crashes out of the gate. ""Cherub Rock"" remains an absolutely stellar opener with a sense of pure sonic melodrama, thanks to Chamberlin's circus-act drum introduction, a tight clip of guitars quickly matched by equally nimble bass, a volcanic blast of a guitar lead, and then a shift to a woozy, still-building sprawl. And all this before the first verse even starts. Throw in everything that followed-- the overt MBV worship of ""Hummer"", the country-rock-tinged wanderlust of ""Mayonaise"", ""Soma""'s update of Prince's ""The Beautiful Ones"" for a new decade, and inevitably the MTV/radio hits <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDYTBoJkQSY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Today""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQtLoJlQD6E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Disarm""</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th-AqMvvBzE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rocket""</a>-- and no matter your take on its mastermind or his divisive whining/sighing vocals, it's an embarrassment of musical riches.</p>
<p>There's also the fact that the album's studio personnel was as essentially stripped down as <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"" target=""_blank"">the White Stripes</a>; Corgan, frantically taking charge in the midst of band dysfunction, recorded nearly everything himself aside from the drums, and he'd probably have handled those too if he could. <i>Siamese Dream</i>'s songs don't blend into each other, but some transitions exist; each stands out in a brilliant sequence, forming perhaps the best concept album they ever made.</p>
<p>One of the main things people complained about was exactly what made the band click even further. If Corgan's early lyrics were classic self-centered/self-righteous/self-pitying teenagerdom run amock, he always had an ear for hooks, metaphors, and deft summaries (thus, on ""Mayonaise"": ""Fool enough to almost be it/ Cool enough to not quite see it""). It's catnip for when you have it bad, no matter how minuscule your problems might really be, and any number of later bands (My Chemical Romance most obviously, and the Pains of Being Pure at Heart most recently) took plenty of notice.</p>
<p>As for the many rarities, more <i>Pisces Iscariot</i> remixes and other demos and alternate versions take a bow, including a six-minute version of ""Siamese Dream"" itself (the original B-side version was a shorter and murkier take that ran under three minutes) and twin instrumentals ""U.S.A."" and ""U.S.S.R."". The DVD is the most worthwhile addition of either reissue; taken from another Metro show a couple of weeks after <i>Siamese Dream</i>'s release, it vividly illustrates how far the band had come in the three years since <i>Gish</i>: It showcases their more varied sound, Corgan's keener sense for playing to the crowd (there are flashes of his and Iha's underrated sense of humor), a killer setlist drawing on both albums (plus ""Starla"" and ""Drown""), and brilliant sound and performances throughout. If Corgan's voice shows strain at many points, the crowd shots are especially entertaining, with endless moshpits and crowdsurfers during most of the loud points and plenty of the slow ones.</p>
<p>The full story of the band's existence has plenty of ups and downs to go through, and there are more reissues to come to spell this out, even as the current version of the band moves along according to Corgan's own cryptic impulses. Yet these two releases still resonate, as both a nostalgia fix underscoring how it was so easy to fall for Smashing Pumpkins in the first place, and as the best introductions to their music any newcomer could want.</p></div>"|16059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16059-gish-deluxe-edition-siamese-dream-deluxe-edition/|8.3|Ned Raggett

The DVD is the most worthwhile addition of either reissue; taken from another Metro show a couple of weeks after <i>Siamese Dream</i>'s release, it vividly illustrates how far the band had come in the three years since <i>Gish</i>: It showcases their more varied sound, Corgan's keener sense for playing to the crowd (there are flashes of his and Iha's underrated sense of humor), a killer setlist drawing on both albums (plus ""Starla"" and ""Drown""), and brilliant sound and performances throughout. If Corgan's voice shows strain at many points, the crowd shots are especially entertaining, with endless moshpits and crowdsurfers during most of the loud points and plenty of the slow ones.</p>
<p>The full story of the band's existence has plenty of ups and downs to go through, and there are more reissues to come to spell this out, even as the current version of the band moves along according to Corgan's own cryptic impulses. Yet these two releases still resonate, as both a nostalgia fix underscoring how it was so easy to fall for Smashing Pumpkins in the first place, and as the best introductions to their music any newcomer could want.</p></div>"|16059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16059-gish-deluxe-edition-siamese-dream-deluxe-edition/|10.0|Ned Raggett

At its core, the EP fused the intricacy of post-dubstep with the production sensibility and anything-goes nature of contemporary pop. And his everything-is-percussion approach built up a sense of bustling hugeness that, speaker-rattling immediacy notwithstanding, never overwhelmed its Swiss-watch rhythmic engineering. That it did so in an intense, almost panicky sort of way was part of the appeal-- the tweaky gallop of the title track's kick-heavy rhythm was one of bass music's best last year-- but it also left a lot of options for new directions to go in the still relatively early stages of an ambitious and wide-ranging style.</p>
<p><i>Dreama</i> plays with a few of those options, maintaining the balance between keeping his big ideas both upfront and subtly beneath the surface. The songs on this EP are largely less concerned with jostling listeners into its rhythmic space and more prone to luring them in instead, though once they get inside they can still get thrown around a bit. The organized clamor and high tension still jumps out here and there, most notably in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12800-stalker-ha/"" target=""_blank"">""Stalker Ha""</a>: Its snares are crisp to the point of brittle, it teases out a water-drip piano note just long enough to make it a neat shock when the melody turns into a <i>Halloween</i> homage, and it builds a sharp sense of anxiety out of the way it layers half-ecstatic/half-haunted wordless soul vocals over an insistently ringing old telephone bell. It's brisk stuff, an easy highlight of a repertoire still on the upswing.</p>
<p>But defining Kingdom by the standards of all that taut chaos his earlier work laid down doesn't fit quite as easily with the rest of the EP. Take the title track, a cut that opens with a loping stride of a beat-- a heavy skulk ready to break out into a Rickey Henderson sprint. If you dork out for drum patterns, it's a headspinning juxtaposition of kicks, snares, claps, and snaps that's striking enough on its own. But it's not put in service of deep-pressure dynamics and a mood steeped in turmoil-- it's more like straight-up funk, with an alternately pitched-up-and-down vocal ""ayyy"" careening off fat synths that simultaneously evoke classic boogie and current Dirty South-indebted R&amp;B. It's wide open and airy to the point of almost being calming, but it still thumps. ""Hood by Air Theme"" is a bit more tense, with foreboding atmospherics, teased-out vocal snippets, swelling bass, and floodgate-bursting percussion buildups rolled out as a blatant prelude to a big drop. But the drop itself is what makes it, and it's so audaciously deployed and timed-- and recognizably iconic in just how joyous it is-- that it'd almost feel like a spoiler just mentioning where it comes from. (It also proves that in the right hands, there's no such thing as a too-obvious sample.)</p>
<p>Maybe the best summary of what Kingdom's capable of can be found in the opening track. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12787-let-you-no/"" target=""_blank"">""Let You No""</a> incorporates a comparatively lesser-known R&amp;B track, Sadie Ama's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90nME27IJ00"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fallin""</a>, to similar dramatic effect as ""Hood by Air Theme"". But it's a more slippery build, capitalizing on sneaking early hints of her voice under cover of the track's whistle-squeak synth and some characteristically skittery beats. We hear her first as faint echoes, then chopped up percussively, then finally breaking through as a full-fledged hook that almost reads, in this new context, like a statement on breaking tension: ""I should've held back/ But I just thought I'd let you know."" For all his polyrhythmic complexity and string-pulling, emotional mood-setting, Kingdom knows his way around a voice-- and that's where he's got his future down on lock. Maybe pop's future, too.</p></div>"|16073.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16073-kingdom-dreama-ep/|8.2|Nate Patrin

Like a particularly crisp logo or font, his songs have a good sense of scale and proportion, and it's clear that a lot of work goes into them. Take a look at <a href=""http://blog.iso50.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his artwork </a>and you'll have a good idea of what his electronic compositions sound like, too. Nostalgic, 1970s-inspired imagery, a heavy sense of tranquility and faraway longing, all tied together with a pretty sleek modernity. Several of these elements have been sort of beaten into the ground in indie music over the past few years, but with <i>Dive</i>, Hansen manages to pull them together in a way that still feels compelling.</p>
<p>Tycho's tracks are built primarily with synths and sampled live instrumentation, and his electro-organic approach brings to mind leaders in this field like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/576-bibio/"" target=""_blank"">Bibio</a>. Sonically, too, he explores terrain similar to those guys': ""A Walk"" and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11672-coastal-brake/"" target=""_blank"">""Coastal Break""</a> nail a pastoral peacefulness with warm, sepia-toned beats and flourishes of acoustic guitar. What separates Tycho, at least from a lot of the bedroom-oriented artists currently exploring similar sounds, is simple craft. These tracks are OCD-level meticulous. Hear it in the percussion: In place of the tinny, synthetic beats favored by lots of indie-ambient startups, Hansen takes extra care to capture real live drum sounds with a crack and thump that makes you feel like you're in the room with them.</p>
<p>His attention to detail goes beyond highlighting individual instruments. It's there in the way Hansen simply builds a song, merging all the synth wooshes and percussive ripples to find a natural arc. ""Daydream"", for example, starts out fairly simple with twinkly guitars and a sturdy, knocking beat, but the song's pulse quickens as it progresses, and by the end you've got something heady enough to live up to its title. Because Hansen clearly wants this to be a deep headphone experience, those subtle shifts go a long way in holding your interest. And in terms of the imagery he builds-- fields, pastures, calming oceanic scenes-- it's all there, and it's pretty easy to set your brain on ""relax"" and conjure up those natural landscapes.</p>
<p>If that nicely detailed tranquility is <i>Dive</i>'s biggest selling point, it also exposes a nagging flaw, which is a lack of tension. Hansen is so committed to keeping things serene that he doesn't incorporate much danger or risk, and at times the album can feel a bit one-note. An out-of-nowhere tonal change or an occasional tinge of darkness would give the record more balance, make it more interesting. That missing element of surprise keeps Tycho from reaching the same heights as BoC or Bibio (the former more otherworldly, the latter more adventurously poppy), but ultimately Hansen succeeds at what he sets out to do. <i>Dive</i> might not be the most ambitious instrumental record you hear all year, but it almost always sounds good.</p></div>"|16071.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16071-dive/|7.0|Joe Colly

But of all the records that had the potential to raise the collective's profile-- including rapper/singer Dessa's coolly strong <i>Castor, the Twin</i>, Sims' feral, heavy-hitting <i>Bad Time Zoo</i>, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/29337-lazerbeak/"" target=""_blank"">Lazerbeak</a>'s indie pop-friendly <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14911-legend-recognize-legend/"" target=""_blank"">Legend Recognize Legend</a>, </i>and Paper Tiger's intricately soulful beat record <i>Made Like Us</i>-- it was, of all things, a mash-up record that blew up. Funny thing is, the concept behind the Cecil Otter co-created <a href=""http://wugazi.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wugazi""</a> project wasn't just some blog-baiting crossover stunt-- it's a way to look at where Doomtree got their early inspiration as an entity, somewhere between the form-like-Voltron <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan/"" target=""_blank"">Wu-Tang</a> enclave's early underground mythbuilding and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a>'s community-building independence.</p>
<p>But the easy-sell concept of Shaolin punk doesn't even really come into obvious play with <i>No Kings</i>. The hardcore continuum isn't as readily acknowledged as it was on <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/3484-pos/"" target=""_blank"">P.O.S.</a>'s solo work, while Lazerbeak's Plastic Constellations background doesn't figure in his productions much, either. (The most traditionally and superficially ""punk rock"" sound on the album is the surfer-hoodlum riff that opener ""No Way"" builds around, and that's sourced from an early 1970s soundtrack-library album.) And not even <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface</a> in full-blown manic stream-of-imagery <i>Supreme Clientele </i>mode was as relentlessly evasive and tricky to parse as some of the verses on here. Loosely alluded-to themes about camaraderie and identity get buried under waves of abstract allusions that leave behind little narrative impact on first listen, other than the vague sense of some victorious resilience.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that vague sense has some intrigue beneath it. Sims, Cecil Otter, Mike Mictlan, P.O.S., and Dessa all share a beat-poet sense of tightly-packed extended abstract metaphors, which they vary to subtle enough degrees that differentiating their voices seems beside the point. That's not to their detriment, and the aforementioned solo releases are proof enough that they can each go in their own distinct directions. But as a unit, they complement each others' talents naturally, each providing their own variations on allegorical stress-rap. ""Team the Best Team"" might be the best example of how all five MCs switch up their approaches-- P.O.S. as sincerely intense slow-burner, Sims's slick-flowing, machete-sharp delivery, Cecil Otter throwing pinpoint darts with deadpan calm, Dessa's deceptively cool-headed, subtly melodic shadowboxing, and Mike Mictlan's agitated yet precise internal-rhyming intensity.</p>
<p>Those qualities are easier to pick up on when they shake you away from the duty of parsing their lyrics, which, unbound by typical battle-rap punchlines or persona-building, at least manage to sell their cryptic insights as rallying calls. The dense weight of verbiage on <i>No Kings</i> actually welcomes uninitiated listeners, rather than siphoning them out for not being advanced enough on some impenetrable ultra-battler shit. And for the scattered talk of 10-year tenures and the occasional fuck-these-other-rappers declaration, the album's tone of flag-planting resistance builds off something deeper and more universal than political beef, star status or personal style. The trespassing-as-liberation undercurrents of ""Bolt Cutter"", the solidarity anthem ""Bangarang"" and the self-realized, apocalypse-flip-off ""Own Yours"" are all introspective in their own ways, but they're too busy staring you dead in the eye to gaze at their own navels.</p>
<p>And it's easy enough to give the lyrics plenty of time and space to sink in-- or even just roll off your back for the time being-- when the beats are this up-front and anthemic. With a production that largely draws off the strengths of their two primary beatmakers, the individuals' highlights-- Lazerbeak's grimy, garage-psych-infused ""String Theory"" and ""Punch-Out""; the Super NES prog of Cecil Otter's beats for ""Beacon"" and ""The Grand Experiment""-- are as much a collective triumph as the group efforts, like the co-produced bookends of motorcycle chain-swinging mini-suite ""No Way"" and the digital brass blowout of ""Fresh New Trash"". Doomtree have been comfortable inside their own space for so long that their individualistic pride in it has grown from defiant to triumphant. That one-off bootleg drew all the attention-- <i>No Kings</i> damn well better keep it.</p></div>"|16043.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16043-doomtree-no-kings/|7.9|Nate Patrin

I've already read several naysayers make comparisons to both of those acts, in order to dismiss Canyons out of hand, but the connection strikes me as both obvious and inexact. True, Canyons have got a taste for the brittle and buzzing tones of early synthesizer music, just like Anthony Gonzalez and crew. And Canyons are interested in creating heart-stirring epics out bits of 1980s pop culture previously deemed off-limits because they were just too damn kitschy, same as M83 and the Cut Copy boys.</p>
<p>But while <i>Hurry Up, We're Dreaming</i> and <i>Zonoscope</i> can sometimes bludgeon you with their need to be monumental, <i>Keep Your Dreams</i> follows a far more idiosyncratic path into much stranger and less immediately arena-pleasing places. For one thing, there's far more weirdo disco boogie, and early ambient house ala <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/"" target=""_blank"">the Orb</a>, and Toto-style sensitive dude rock in Canyons' sound. All those wobbly saxophone solos, for one thing. And the stoned hand percussion and jungle bird sound effects. The best tracks here aren't so much sweeping shoegaze/new wave classics-in-the-making as bedroom producer dance jams that keep sprouting all sorts of weird-pop moments as the beats roll on.</p>
<p>When they're really on, Canyons are maximalists who seem pained to follow one idea to its conclusion when they can keep things mutating, unrepentant oddballs who still love a good earworm but would prefer to have three. Plus they thankfully have little truck with revisionist notions of good taste when it comes 80s dance music, which was often pretty great <i>because</i> it was so gauche. <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/forkcast/16232-circadia-under-a-blue-sky/"" target=""_blank"">""Under a Blue Sky""</a> is so unashamedly campy and overloaded with winning ""bad"" ideas retrieved from the dustbin of dance music history that it makes the DFA's rehabilitative aims sound downright acetic. Slap bass that's so clean and stiff it feels more robotic than fluidly funky? Check. A campy ""menacing"" vocalist, pitched-down Adonis-style, spouting suggestive French gibberish? Got it. Gritless ""funk"" guitar  that makes Power Station sound like Muddy Waters? Yup. An elephant's trumpet call for the hell of it? Sure, why not. Canyons remix and get remixed by ""acceptably"" serious dance dons <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12679-see-blind-through-dj-harvey-remix-ft-ramona-gonzalez-of-nite-jewel/"" target=""_blank"">like DJ Harvey</a>, but the high points of <i>Keep Your Dreams</i> revel in the unacceptable baubles of what was once mainstream pop. They remember that so much of 80s dance-pop blurred the line between novelty music and alien-sounding futurism.</p>
<p>Even when they try to play things straight, toying with more hipster-approved genres, Canyons can't seem to help stretching out the weirdness in the forms they're playing with. <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12440-see-blind-through-ft-ramona-gonzalez-of-nite-jewel/"" target=""_blank"">""See Blind Through""</a> is classic late-80s Chicago house, right down to the purposefully crude vocal cut-ups and the Mr. Fingers bassline. Except the whole thing's been DJ Screwed, a tempo changes that amplifies the darkness of the original sound. It becomes a woozy black hole of faux soul, not too far off from the similarly molasses-ized grooves you'd find on Rub N Tug mixtapes a few years back. And then the vocals evoke not only a drag show diva but a zonked-out Michael McDonald wandering through a warehouse party. It shouldn't work but does. It's just warped enough from its source materials to avoid bland pastiche, but not crassly out-there, weird for the sake of it. Canyons clearly love the stuff they draw from, enough to not merely want to ape it, and they know genre shouldn't be fucked with just to be ""interesting."" ""My Rescue"" could have been a pleasant enough indie rock song, stirring in a generic sort of way, but the deep house piano and percussion give it just enough of an edge, the two distinct genres harmonizing into sound more indie bands should make use of.</p>
<p>What keeps the prize moments of <i>Keep Your Dreams</i> from feeling obnoxiously ""eclectic"" is the smoothness of the production and the arrangements. The tracks may be over-stuffed with ideas, but Canyons have also studied the way 80s producers could make ""big"" tracks where every idea rang out clear, where all the little touches felt integrated into something bigger than the sum of a lot of cute parts. But unfortunately that the zigzagging dance-collage stuff only accounts for little more than half of <i>Keep Your Dreams</i>' running time, and on the rest of the album, Canyons' interest in smoothness drags them down. The least convincing side of Canyons is the soft-rock stuff, and there's a lot of it here, especially in the record's back-end.</p>
<p>Maybe it feels flat and less creative than Canyons' dance tunes simply because there's been so much laid-back yacht gunk over the last half-decade. Or maybe it's because Canyons don't seem to devote half as much creative energy to this side of their output. The deckside reveries on <i>Keep Your Dreams</i> really are played too straight, and hardly convincing, even as homage, when A/B'd with the stuff you can still hear for free every day on classic rock radio. A whole album of disorienting patchwork grooves like ""Under a Blue Sky"" might have eventually worn the casual listener down. But Canyons also want to be songwriters, and though they draw on different inspirations, it's here that they fall short compared to M83 and Cut Copy. Forget Lindsey Buckingham, or hell, even Mark Knopfler. But when they go for manic instead of mellow, Canyons do bring something new, even if it's just intensity, to the 80s retro party.</p></div>"|16065.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16065-keep-your-dreams/|6.5|Jess Harvell

The best pop music transports you to somewhere beyond words, and Rihanna's strongest singles all seem to be in on this secret. Need I remind you of some of her most powerful hooks: <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvBfHwUxHIk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ella-ella-ella-ay</a></i>. <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0CGsw6h60k&amp;feature=relmfu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oh-na-na</a>. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koVHN6eO4Xg&amp;ob=av3e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ay-ayy-ay-ayy-ay-ayy.</a></i></p>
<p>But as anyone with a Twitter handle will tell you, these are chatty times, and in 2011, the pop landscape's fittingly caught between two maximalist extremes: the winking theatricality of <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj</a>, <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/"" target=""_blank"">Lady Gaga</a>, and Katy Perry, and the dribbling confessional-pop of <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>, <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a>, and (yes, they're more alike than they'd like to believe) <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/artists/28495-taylor-swift/"" target=""_blank"">Taylor Swift</a>. Barbados-born, millions-selling, armfuls-of-awards-winning Rihanna has found staggering success (23 years old; eleven #1 singles and rising) borrowing a little bit from each of these tendencies. Her recent music videos have dabbled in trendy pop artifice (check out her neon-hued, irresistibly smiley turn in Guetta’s ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAc4zHEDd7o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Who’s That Chick?</a>"" or the <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/artists/23678-david-lachapelle/"" target=""_blank"">David LaChapelle</a>-aping-- <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/thread-count/rihanna-david-lachapelle-settle-s-m-video-lawsuit-20111019"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">literally</a>-- ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdS6HFQ_LUc&amp;ob=av2e&amp;oref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fresults%3Fsearch_query%3Drihanna%2Bs%26m%26oq%3Drihanna%2Bs%26m%26aq%3Df%26aqi%3Dg-C10%26aql%3D%26gs_sm%3De%26gs_upl%3D236293l236939l0l237161l3l3l0l0l0l0l383l383l3-1l1l0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">S&amp;M</a>""), while her brooding and personal 2009 album <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/reviews/albums/13740-rated-r/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rated R</i></a> commented-- however obliquely-- on her public struggles. Rihanna seems more comfortable flitting between these two extremes than settling on either, but her past two albums have at least had some thematic cohesion. The same can't be said of <i>Talk That Talk</i>: Heavy on filler though it's only 11 tracks long, it feels not only slight but muddled, an assortment of half-baked ideas that never bloom. A stitched-together collection of club bangers, sleaze-pop missteps, and mid-tempo inspirational ballads, <i>Talk That Talk</i> feels at times like three different records, only one of which might have been any good.</p>
<p>Of course, what we're <i>supposed</i> to be talking is about how this is Rihanna's ""dirtiest"" album yet. Early blog chatter reported to lots of critics blushing in preview listening sessions and making questionably bold declarations (""<a href=""http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2011-11-09/album-preview-rihannas-talk-that-talk-is-the-dirtiest-pop-record-since-madonnas-erotica/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The dirtiest pop album since Madonna's Erotica!</a>"") that suggested that they listen to very little pop radio, or that they have never been to an <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"" target=""_blank"">R. Kelly</a> concert. <i>Talk That Talk</i>'s raunchier moments should surprise no one: Rihanna's always been singing about sex-- she's just never shown such an unfortunate proclivity for cheesy lyrics and dessert metaphors. ""Suck my cockiness/ Lick my persuasion,"" Ri commands on the embarrassingly literal ""Cockiness (I Love It)"", hoping the boldness of the delivery will distract you from thinking about what a clunky line it is (it won't, though Bangladesh's beats might). The Esther Dean-penned ""Drunk on Love"" features a weak chorus lyric and vocal whose bombast feels out of place in the track's laid back, xx-sampling atmosphere. Clocking in at a puzzling-yet-merciful one minute and 18 seconds, <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">The-Dream</a> co-produced ""Birthday Cake"" is even more heavy-handed (lots of icing puns). There are flickers of empowerment here, but mostly it proves little more than the fact that a female artist can be responsible for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYMxOzxKYYo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeremih-grade</a> cheese, too. A Rihanna album has never been without the occasional lyrical misfire (""Sex in the air/ I don't care/ I love the smell of it"" comes to mind), but at least on a track like ""S&amp;M"" she sounds like she's having fun. For a record so preoccupied with passion and pleasure, most of <i>Talk That Talk</i> feels unsuitably robotic.</p>
<p>At least things start out strong. <i>Talk That Talk</i>'s saving grace is its first stretch of tracks: the blithe and tropical ""You Da One"", ""We Found Love"", and the album's other Harris track ""Where Have You Been"", which doesn't stray much from the single's winning formula, a simple lyric of romantic longing that explodes into a club-ready beat. And though it's no ""Umbrella"", the <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z</a> reunion ""Talk That Talk"" is one of the more playful moments here, though I'll say that the patented H.O.V.-giggle doesn't feel entirely earned following a line like: ""Had it by a bladder/ She like 'oh I gotta pee'.""</p>
<p>I've read some comment-section conspiracy theorists who believe Rihanna is in single-minded pursuit of Hot 100 domination, and the rate at which she's pumping out albums (roughly one a year since 2005) is an attempt to populate the singles chart until the end of time. There might be some truth to this (her singles collection is going to be killer), and with ""Death of the Album"" prophecies ever looming it's worth wondering whether or not that's such a crime. But 2011 found plenty of pop artists still breathing new life into the format: Beyonce's <i>4</i> and Lady Gaga's <i>Born This Way</i> were probably the most solid examples-- two bombastic records that also explore the nuance of their respective artists' personas.<i> Talk That Talk</i> tries too hard to send a more one-dimensional message and ends up falling flat: Rihanna's obviously going for sexy here, but her music's at its most alluring when she's blissed out in her own reverie, not taking the time to spell it all out for us.</p></div>"|16072.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16072-rihanna-talk-that-talk/|6.0|Lindsay Zoladz

And... what if it actually exploded all over the walls during a show?"" That's <a href=""http://ty-segall.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ty Segall</a> speaking to <i>SF Weekly</i> earlier this year about his 2011 song, ""My Head Explodes"". It's a fairly straightforward description of a song that isn't terribly complicated. Guy sings. People watch. Guy's head explodes. It's not hard to picture Segall's head exploding. He sings hard and loud and with the shrill fury of a castrated animal. And he does this a lot. Since quitting his band, Epsilons, less than four years ago, Segall has become arguably the most exciting and probably the most prolific member of San Francisco's evolving garage rock scene, which also includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"" target=""_blank"">Thee Oh Sees</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28104-the-fresh-onlys/"" target=""_blank"">the Fresh &amp; Onlys</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19365-sic-alps/"" target=""_blank"">Sic Alps</a> (with whom Segall formerly played). Since going solo, he's released five albums of original material; two split LPs; a live album; a cassette-only compilation; eight 7""s; four split EPs; a collaborative album with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29837-mikal-cronin/"" target=""_blank"">Mikal Cronin</a>; and appeared on four compilation albums. The man is prolific. Trying to keep up will, if not enough make your head explode, at least incite heavy migraines.</p>
<p>This year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15557-goodbye-bread/"" target=""_blank"">Goodbye Bread</a></i>, his first release for Drag City, is easily his best, the accumulation of learned songwriting tricks and a developing melodic sense, with an emphasis on sonic clarity and the influence of some august icons, notably John Lennon and Marc Bolan. (Oh yeah, Segall recorded a tribute EP to Bolan's T. Rex this year, too.) In the afterglow of <i>Goodbye</i>'s success, Memphis label Goner Records, Segall's former home, has compiled <i>Singles 2007-2010</i>, a sort of refresher course and unheard odds-and-ends set that serves as a tenacious, temporary portrait of Segall. There are hints everywhere at the songwriter Segall would become, but <i>Singles</i> is much more about the flail of youth than honoring tradition. In a few years, he's garnered comparisons to a wide swath of artists, from <i>Nuggets</i>-friendly English bands like the Troggs and the Pretty Things, to working-class American menace-peddlers like the Stooges and Ramones, to early recordings by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"" target=""_blank"">the White Stripes</a> (especially prevalent on this comp), down to the late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7921-jay-reatard/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Reatard</a>, a significant guidepost for Segall.</p>
<p><i>Singles</i> is a stew mixing all of those ingredients and more. There are hints of Devo in the mechanized synth and drum tracks on early versions of ""So Alone"" and ""The Drag"". (Before forming his band, Segall often played all the instruments on his records, including drum machine.) Listen for ? and the Mysterians-like organ at the outset of ""Skin"", maybe the best song here. And in that voice, which vacillates from desperate howl to wallowing drone, a little Kurt Cobain, too. It's hard to know what's a relic and what's an advance here. Segall appears in love with surface imitation at times, while peeling the skin back at others. On the faux-British B-side ""Fuzzy Cat"", you can hear John Entwistle of the Who's gothic goof-off ""Boris the Spider"". The appearance of a cover of Chain Gang's coiled, minor punk masterpiece, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrGm8nC4MEQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Son of Sam""</a>, feels like a cred grab, but an accomplished one. On ""Caesar"", which would later appear on 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14347-melted/"" target=""_blank"">Melted</a></i> in more polished form, there's a little of the stomping acoustic rock that would become the underbelly of <i>Goodbye Bread</i>. Segall, like so many developing artists, seemed to be constantly toggling between ideas of himself.</p>
<p><i>Singles</i>, while comprising 25 songs, is still less than one hour's worth of music-- this iteration of Segall was economical. Only now, as his ambition grows, so do the lengths of his songs. Just one here exceeds three minutes-- it's the demo version of ""So Alone"", which was eventually whittled down to less than two and a half minutes for <i>Horn the Unicorn</i>. After acclaim for the elliptical and sometimes very pretty <i>Goodbye Bread</i>, one might assume Segall's left the crash-and-bash of <i>Singles 2007-2010</i> behind. But then, his new single, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12699-spiders/"" target=""_blank"">""Spiders""</a>, is all doom and drone-- a violent, glorious devolution-- clocking in just under three minutes. So much for obvious trajectories.</p></div>"|16070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16070-singles-2007-2010/|8.3|Sean Fennessy

The top result is a Google map that still shows a Boddie Recording label at the address. Switch to Street View, and there's an attractive red two-story house with yellow trim and a sign out front that says ""Boddie,"" with eighth notes standing in for the Ds. Down the driveway, a garage is visible, but it's not an ordinary garage. It's the remains of Boddie Recording Company, the long-lived but never well-known recording concern of Thomas and Louise Boddie. The outbuildings behind the house still contain the ephemera of record labels that long ago faded to silence, a studio that hosted its last session decades ago, and a pressing plant that has sat idle since the mid-1980s, some of the components of the pressing line long since sold off.</p>
<p>In this space, a few hundred 45s and LPs were prepared for a world that never bothered to hear them. Though this release doesn't strictly fall under the banner of <a href=""http://www.numerogroup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Numero Group</a>'s long-running soul archeology project <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Eccentric+Soul"" target=""_blank"">Eccentric Soul</a></i>, it fits with the spirit of the project, unearthing not just the music made at Boddie but also the history and personalities surrounding it-- the old, grainy photographs and detailed histories contained in the two liner-note booklets place the music on these three CDs in the context of the people that made it and the place where it was made.</p>
<p>Boddie Recording Company was born out of Thomas Boddie's passion for electronics, a passion he acquired when very young. He built his own radios and speaker systems in junior high, went to tech school (the only black student in his class), served in the Army Air Force during World War II. He got himself a job repairing organs after his discharge and apprenticed at a local Cleveland studio while amassing a collection of studio gear in the basement of the house he shared with his brother. Boddie's fledgling company cut its first sides in 1959, the same year Berry Gordy founded Motown on the other side of Lake Erie, but the two companies' arcs could not have been more different. Where Gordy assembled a brilliant core of creative people who built long-lasting working relationships and devised processes of production and quality control that turned his company into a powerhouse, Boddie and his wife worked day and night with very limited resources to build a studio behind their new house that wasn't ready for business until 1964.</p>
<p>Even then, there was no team. Boddie recorded local acts but had no house band. The company established several imprints on which to release recordings but had no real avenues through which to promote them. The first disc of this set focuses on the Soul Kitchen and related Cookin' labels, which were active primarily in the early 1970s. The music on these releases falls mostly in the psychedelic soul realm-- during the same period, one of Cleveland's most admired bands was the Purple Image, a funky psychedelic outfit that recorded a classic self-titled LP in 1970. The Creations Unlimited and the Inter-Circle each cut strong fuzz funk singles, Ricky Hodges' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfssYhTrkHc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Feel It (The Love You Have For Me)""</a> features fantastically ragged guitar taking bites out of an elastic beat while flute flutters around his soul shouting, and ""Soul Feeling"" finds Frankie Pighee &amp; the Soulettes making their own outstanding contribution to the long lineage of soul roll-call tunes.</p>
<p>None of it is especially polished, and it's hard to pinpoint the potential hits that never were, because there were so many records like this being made at the time; but there is a certain optimism and spirit of hard work in these recordings that makes them an exciting body of work to listen to all at once. The same can be said of the earlier recordings on disc two, which were mostly released on the Luau label. There are some great band names-- the Atomic Aces and the Modern Detergents definitely top the list-- and a lot of rollicking R&amp;B on the disc, which works with disc one to paint a picture of the evolving soul scene in Cleveland during the era. There was a lot of talent toiling down there in the dead-end clubs, and Boddie captured a good cross-section of it.</p>
<p>While these recordings are fun and sometimes even great, they didn't exactly provide the seeds for any money trees, and Thomas Boddie continued to repair organs and radios on the side. He slowly pieced together his own pressing plant, he recorded a lot of out-of-town bluegrass and folk groups touring through Cleveland, he built his own mobile recording unit, he ran a side company called Boddie Audio Advertising (it was a car with a PA on top-- they used it to support Carl Stokes' campaign for mayor), and he also tapped in to one of the safer-- if not more profitable-- markets in music: gospel.</p>
<p>The final disc of the set is filled with gospel recordings from Boddie's Bounty imprint, spanning from 1967 all the way to 1983, the very twilight of Boddie as a recording concern. Bits of gospel do crop up on the other discs (the King James Version's two tracks on disc one are especially entertaining), but disc three is a clinic in the numerous ways that singers and bands found to put their faith into music. Some of it is ham-handed and overwrought-- Rev. R.L. Hubbard's operatics on ""Child of the King"" do not complement the spooky soul backing, and the screechy kid vocals of the Wings of Faith Juniors of Grand Rapids, Michigan, are rough sledding-- but a lot of it is clever and enjoyable on its own musical terms. Brother Bill wasn't the only one to wrap religion in a faux-countercultural rap, but he does it with a lot of panache, and Silver King's ""Trouble in the Water"" psychedelicizes a variation on the old ""Wade in the Water"" themes.</p>
<p>A couple of songs engage in some rather un-Christian theft. Sound of Soul's ""Gospel Train"" is actually the Impressions' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lenHYXtiqoI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""People Get Ready""</a> lazily retitled, and the Gospel Ensemble's ""What You Need"" liberally borrows from the Isley Brothers' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMimqfJVedE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It's Your Thing""</a>, to name two examples that give soul fans an opportunity to play detective. Some of the later gospel sides were recorded not at Boddie's studio but in the actual churches, using his mobile unit. As his vinyl pressing operation, never big enough to be a hugely profitable concern, struggled in the early 1980s in the face of collapsing demand, Thomas Boddie got into cassette duplication. He'd often make a recording at a service that would then be duplicated and sold to congregants.</p>
<p>Boddie never shuttered his company. He died in 2006, but he hadn't ever considered putting Boddie Recording Company to bed permanently. Instead, it faded quietly away, years of incredibly hard work and long hours settling silently under layers of dust in the buildings behind his house. Boddie is a footnote to Cleveland's musical history, more or less, but as the city's premier low-cost studio, he provided a huge service to the city's music scene for over 20 years. This set pulls some of that service into the light and tells a story with the records he left behind.</p></div>"|16050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16050-boddie-recording-company-cleveland-ohio/|7.5|Joe Tangari

Singer Brenda Malvini appears to fall into the latter category; after growing up in North Highlands in Sacramento, California, she moved to New York to attend NYU, ultimately naming her band after the place where she was raised. If <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29174-north-highlands/"">North Highlands</a> find fame, at least she can never be accused of forgetting where she came from. <i>Wild One</i> is the band's debut full-length, constructed by Malvini and her band, which demonstrates a proficiency seldom heard on the Brooklyn indie rock circuit. Fortunately, this is a group that knows how to juggle the technical gifts at its disposal and the emotional application needed to make this something more than an exercise in indie navel-gazing. <i>Wild One</i> might seem like an inappropriate banner to hoist over such quotidian surface structures, but dig a little deeper and it clearly represents this band's desire to shake things up every once in a while.</p>
<p>Like any new group still etching out an identity, it's not hard to pluck out precedents to the North Highlands sound as this record progresses. In particular, the recently revived <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1316-electrelane/"">Electrelane</a> circa <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10181-no-shouts-no-calls/"">No Shouts, No Calls</a></i> are a strong reference point, with Malvini's singing mirroring Verity Susman's vocal lines on occasion (""Steady Steady,"" ""Roundhouse""). The band members are fond of taking her work and interlacing it with jerky rhythms that are clamped to the kind of ultra-bright guitar playing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"">Vampire Weekend</a> practice, ultimately settling into a style that's one part ice-cold detachment and one part fizzy pop encompassment. The juxtaposition is good for creating a space for North Highlands to operate within, where the aloof vocal on a song like ""Chicago"" keeps their audience at arm's length, only for some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4245-tindersticks/"">Tindersticks</a>-y string arrangements to pull them back in with their warmth and vitality.</p>
<p>Those strings add a touch of drama to <i>Wild One</i> whenever they surface. ""Lion Heart"" is a moving piece or orchestral pop that errs close to the kind of drunken flamboyance that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/61-marc-almond/"">Marc Almond</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4644-patrick-wolf/"">Patrick Wolf</a> are fond of staggering around in, conjuring up a feeling North Highlands would be wise to return to more often than they do here. Much of this record remains solidly grounded in indie rock, with the band members occasionally scattering trails of potential paths they could follow behind them. When they keep it simple, with a guitar jangle and a driving beat (""Bruce"") or by taking the pace down a little (""Best Part"") it works simply as a showcase for Malvini's striking voice. She tends to shy away from revealing too much about herself, falling into a group of similarly minded female singers that includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a>'s Trish Keenan and Laetitia Sadier from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>, where the not-knowing leaves a series of questions simply hanging in the air.</p>
<p>That sense of mystery is North Highlands' biggest asset, especially as they can always anchor it in a sound that's flexible enough to allow them to experiment and work up characteristics that are identifiably their own. The next step should be to shore up that sound, in a similar manner to Broadcast's leap from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/946-the-noise-made-by-people/"">The Noise Made by People</a></i> to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/947-haha-sound/"">Haha Sound</a></i>. Sometimes <i>Wild One</i> wears its influences a little too hard on its sleeve, or strives too hard to create something anthemic with across-the-board appeal-- the closing ""Here's"" fulfills both of those criteria. That song has a tension that feels ill-fitting, because when North Highlands relax into their looser material, this stuff just seems to pour out of them, delivering an elegance that suggests they could shake off their tendency to emulate artists to whom they're so obviously in thrall.</p></div>"|16061.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16061-wild-one/|6.7|Nick Neyland

It was invented by SC members Elizabeth Sankey and Jeremy Warmsley; to drive the whole conceptual thing home, the band's created a zine pressed in limited physical quantities and available to view on <a href=""http://www.wearesummercamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their website</a> (hint: click on ""Condale""); along with narrative-extending diary entries and fake interviews with faker bands, there's the cover to a 1977 issue of <i>Penthouse</i>, a poster for the obscure 1974 skin flick <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217839/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Teenage Milkmaid</i></a>, and <a href=""http://s11.bdbphotos.com/images/orig/e/y/eyqhywf1lh9fyehh.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the cover of the February 27, 1984 issue of <i>Jet</i></a>, which features an image of Brooke Shields and Michael Jackson together. On the upper right corner of the band's website, there's a by-the-minute update on the current date and time-- with two small alterations: the year is listed as 1984, and it's specified that no matter where you are, you're living under ""Condale Time"" for the moment.</p>
<p>Obviously, Warmsley and Sankey went to great lengths to create this world, and in a way it's impressive, but the non-musical aspects of <i>Welcome to Condale</i> (especially the ""zine"" portion, which eschews the personal-cultural DIY nature of the form in favor of signifier-collecting scrapbook nostalgia) highlights the pair's predilection for time-distanced cultural references. Anyone who listened to last year's <i>Young</i> EP could have seen this coming, as Sankey sang about ""A boy dressed like <i>Teen Wolf</i>"" and friends taking photos ""with Polaroid cameras"" on a song titled after Winona Ryder's character in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Heathers</i></a>. Still, their (sometimes ironic, sometimes not) devotion to the past is persistent, especially in the face of the growing realization that such devotion in indie culture is exhausting itself: in the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgrP6fzGKjg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for <i>Welcome to Condale</i> single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12464-better-off-without-you/"" target=""_blank"">""Better Off Without You""</a>, Sankey sings her punchy part under an Instagram'd filter, juxtaposed by vintage-looking footage of teen-focused films. Warmsley is seen playing some guitar, wearing a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mountain-Three-Wolf-Short-Sleeve/dp/B002HJ377A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""wolf shirt""</a> (something he's <a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/fourohfive_production/data/3086/latest_news/Summer-Camp-2011.jpg?1321456644"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">known to wear</a>, it seems).</p>
<p>As some people tend to forget, indie pop's relationship with the past is part of the genre's lifeblood, with bands using out-of-time images and cultural figures to create their own little universes, away from the pain of modern life. Summer Camp, on the other hand, collect such influences like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pogs</a> (a bit of cultural ephemera untouched by these two, thus far at least) and merely throw 'em out here and there, without context or relation to the music. Witness the ill-juxtaposed vocal samples that open the lost-youth lament ""Summer Camp"", a far cry from the Tough Alliance's personal-is-political use of <a href=""http://atazagorafobia.tumblr.com/post/4440845050/dennis-you-have-no-respect-for-art-no-respect-at"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a key line</a> from John Cassavetes' <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053270/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Shadows</i></a> on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtHvrIc8WU8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A New Chance""</a>, or the fact that the album's swaggering bedroom-arena highlight, ""Brian Krakow"", takes its name from <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0079024/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the nerdy character on ""My So-Called Life""</a>. The song's a bit of a brilliant kiss-off-but-not-really anthem, featuring a rare lead vocal turn from Warmsley that, truth be told, carries more bold confidence than the <i>actual</i> (fictional) Krakow could have ever possessed.</p>
<p>An entire album of ""Brian Krakow""s, or the winding, ecstatic pop of ""Better Off Without You"", would make all of Summer Camp's nostalgic wrongs somewhat right. Unfortunately, <i>Welcome to Condale</i> is stylistically all over the place and, despite its generally upbeat tone, kind of a drag to listen to (the fact that those two aforementioned tracks kick off the album highlights how front-loaded the thing is). Instead, we get some more sparkly pop (""1988""), chugging indie rock (""Down""), sluggish electro murk (""I Want You"", ""Nobody Knows You""), and a re-recorded version of <i>Young</i>'s ""Ghost Train"" that, while improving on the original, shows how little they've grown as a band between then and now. As producer, Pulp's Steve Mackey does a decent job of figuring out what kind of retro-tastic sheen this type of music warrants (hint: kind of like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb-yTZh4zDE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a>, or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SzjDOk_u9I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a>), but its application seems tacky and forced, especially since the source material isn't very engaging to begin with.</p>
<p>""Everything changes when you grow old."" That's the first thing you see when you visit Summer Camp's website, as a line is slowly drawn through the phrase, negating its inevitable truth. The truth, obviously, is things <i>do</i> change as you get older, as they should and as Warmsley should know quite well; prior to starting Summer Camp with Sankey, he released two solo albums of cut-and-paste electro-acoustic pop (2006's <i>The Art of Fiction</i> and 2008's <i>How We Became</i>) that bear little resemblance to the music he's making now. Of course, plenty of musicians change the sounds they're working in all the time, even if Warmsley's recent move toward this particular brand of in-vogue, backward navel-gazing is suspicious in its possible calculation. The fact, however, that he was easily able to make the transfer from a front-and-center singer/songwriter to a competent sideman to Sankey's vocal talents highlights how little actual personality and originality Summer Camp possess as a project.

The thirst for innovation is such that some scene-watchers have <a href=""http://earthexit.blogspot.com/2011/11/its-seems-that-there-is-still-lot-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">likened current bass music to post-punk</a>, stratifying its sounds in search of growth. Previous British dance movements-- drum'n'bass and garage-- found such terrifying end-games that the bass scene has made a constant effort to never stop swimming. To brand an artist as someone who simply executes, however masterfully, is to damn him with faint praise. Increasingly, bass producers have looked backward (thumping, linear 4/4 bangers) or forward (mutated footwork fever-dreams), largely ignoring (as Pitchfork writer Philip Sherburne put it in discussion), the fertile terrain between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28029-joy-orbison/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Orbison</a>.</p>
<p>On their debut full-length for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23840-scuba/"" target=""_blank"">Scuba</a>'s Hotflush label, New York duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29967-sepalcure/"" target=""_blank"">Sepalcure</a> nimbly incorporate current trends but arrive at a sound-- politely mysterious rhythms put to life by haunted vocal samples-- that's familiar and rich. Sepalcure is a collaboration between two dance veterans, Praveen Sharma and Travis Stewart. That their album scans as a bit of a melting pot should not surprise. Sharma runs dance media hub <a href=""http://percussionlab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Percussion Lab</a> and records misty, retro-futuristic house as Braille. Stewart hops genres as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2630-machine-drum/"" target=""_blank"">Machinedrum</a>, whose footwork-fusion album <i>Room(s)</i> is widely regarded as one of the year's best dance releases (I regret <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15621-rooms/"" target=""_blank"">underrating its idiosyncrasies</a>).</p>
<p>Admittedly influenced by the scores of talent massing on forward-thinking bass labels like Hotflush and Hessle Audio, their collaboration was the result of boredom and opportunity (Sharma's girlfriend, visual artist Sougwen Chung, was studying abroad; she handles all of the group's visuals). Some combination of serendipity and skill saw the duo's first tracks fall into the hands of Mary Anne Hobbs and Paul Rose (Scuba); two well-received EPs later, a short two-week recording session birthed <i>Sepalcure</i>.</p>
<p>That <i>Sepalcure</i> is so balanced and organized can be attributed to the experience and seeming calm of its principals; that it sounds so lively and inviting is the greater achievement. While syncopated rhythms-- pattering cymbals and kicks with now-familiar handclaps-- and probing bass sponge up dubstep's urban paranoia, Sharma and Stewart add plenty of more explicitly emotional touches to their work. How else to explain the Who's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbxxuasmSpA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""See Me, Feel Me""</a> stretched transparent over, um, ""See Me Feel Me""? (And how the hell did that sample get cleared?) Or the hammy Italo-disco pianos that build up under the fingernails of ""Hold On"" and ""Yuh Nuh See""? <i>Sepalcure</i>'s moody haze and mid-song shifts prevent it from being dance-floor fodder (""The One"" is a welcome exception), but neither is it music by which to lonesomely stare at rainstorms.</p>
<p>Vocals play a prominent role throughout. During their best moments, Sharma and Stewart subject rave-y house divas to dubstep's pinched nausea, turning the gospel-like fervor of their sources into grimy hymns. (Those new to the group should acquaint themselves with early single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBp0EyMhCwE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Love Pressure""</a>.) ""Breezin"" is especially devoted, its tremulous refrain-- ""Mountains high and low!""-- ascending above its buzzy synths. The duo recorded many of the instruments live, and there is a punch especially to the pianos (electric and acoustic) that their contemporaries frequently lack. They layer these instruments expertly, and tracks such as lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12753-pencil-pimp/"" target=""_blank"">""Pencil Pimp""</a> and ""Eternally Yrs"" function as bass-y, house-y suspensions: discrete parts bound by weightless float. Tufts of melody chunk off ""Yuh Nuh See"", as its meticulous, six-note sequence snakes around a vocal hum and sprinkled, choral beauty.</p>
<p>Straightforward descriptions of <i>Sepalcure</i>-- a finely manicured mix of dubstep, house, UK funky, and footwork-- make it sound pedestrian, even contrived. The reality is anything but; Sharma and Stewart have found an alleyway that few other producers have traversed in 2011. Bass producers can treasure-hunt all they want, but increasingly it feels like someone should stay behind to stack the doubloons. Stewart is moving to Berlin, casting doubt on Sepalcure's future. If they never record again, their collaboration may mirror their achievement here: an evolutionary moment, familiar and brief enough to gloss over, rich enough to return to.</p></div>"|16062.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16062-sepalcure/|8.4|Andrew Gaerig

Much of their appeal comes from the fact that they're a machine with four equal parts: the wide-eyed, cult-leader charisma of frontman John Dwyer, the effortless cool of keyboardist/singer Brigid Dawson, the pulsating low end of Petey Dammit, and the steel-solid rhythmic anchor of Mike Shoun. With unspeakable chemistry and an instinctual bond that borders on telepathic, the band has taken its wildly cacophonous and setlist-free live show to must-see status, turning music venues populated by arm-folding spectators into anarchic riot scenes. An Oh Sees show is a place where combing the floor for your shoes when the house lights come on becomes ritualistic, where getting kicked in the face by a renegade crowd-surfer provokes a shit-eating grin instead of a scowl. Most of the band's best albums serve as recorded documents of their live sets; you can practically hear Dwyer swallowing microphones and spitting upwards to the rafters.</p>
<p><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15540-castlemania/"" target=""_blank"">Castlemania</a></i>-- Thee Oh Sees' first record of 2011-- made it easier to remember that the band started out as Dwyer's solo project, a vehicle forged as a left turn from the eardrum terrorism of his garage-punk cult heroes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/939-coachwhips/"" target=""_blank"">Coachwhips</a>. Rife with kaleidoscopic woodwind arrangements and vocals akin to the green cartoon monsters that grace the cover art of many Oh Sees full-lengths, the record was a refreshingly weird slab of hallucinogenic psych-pop, a headphones record for the arty garage-rock über-faithful. (You know, the kind of people who own more than two volumes of <i>Back From the Grave</i> or take a road trip to Gonerfest every single year.)</p>
<p>The opening seconds of <i>Carrion Crawler/The Dream</i> feature the squawking of a saxophone-- the last remnants of <i>Castlemania</i>'s woodwind-centered psychedelia sputtering out like smoke from a 1920s automobile that ran out of gas. Just as <i>Castlemania</i> was the apotheosis of Dwyer's cracked vision as a singer/songwriter, <i>Carrion Crawler/The Dream</i> showcases the full-band version of Thee Oh Sees at the height of their powers. Many of the album's songs have been road-tested for over a year, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5576-the-intelligence/"" target=""_blank"">Intelligence</a> brain-trust Lars Finberg was drafted as the band's second drummer. Instead of disrupting the dynamic, Finberg fits in perfectly, occasionally adding some polyrhythmic flair, bolstering the already tight and rock-solid rhythm section. Dammit, Shoun, and now Finberg serve as the grounded basis that allow the songs to veer off on wild tangents without completely falling apart.</p>
<p>Having the bassist and two drummers holding everything in place gives the high end room to explore, a task in part handled by the extraordinary vocal interplay of Dwyer and Dawson. In spite of the former being the creative nucleus of the band, there is no ""lead singer"" designation in Thee Oh Sees-- Dwyer and Dawson singing nearly every lyric in unison. As Dawson's straight-laced vocal presence stays in line on most of the songs, Dwyer naturally plays the madman, his voice coasting below, zigzagging between, and occasionally even scaling above hers-- the latter reminiscent of the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5441-black-francis/"" target=""_blank"">Black Francis</a> would often take the higher octave over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7231-kim-deal/"" target=""_blank"">Kim Deal</a> on several <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"" target=""_blank"">Pixies</a> tracks. Dawson provides poppy ""ba-bas,"" while Dwyer shouts his head off on ""Contraption/Soul Desert"", and she's there to eerily coo while he's practically speaking in tongues on ""Crack in Your Eye"". But more often than not, it sounds like Dwyer is singing backup for Dawson, a testament to how equal the parts in Thee Oh Sees really are.</p>
<p>Scratching away at his strings with bloodthirsty ferociousness, Dwyer's guitar playing is best described in terms usually reserved for feral cats. His solos are not as much foot-on-the-monitor, spotlight-capturing moments as they are products of primal instinct. This is particularly evident on the album's two longform tracks, the two songs that combine to make up the album's title. Much like last year’s ""Warm Slime""-- the audio equivalent of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_match"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pro-wrestling iron man match</a>-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12386-carrion-crawler/"" target=""_blank"">""Carrion Crawler""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12682-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">""The Dream""</a> experiment with what happens when you tighten things to a breaking point and then let go. Short blasts of distortion leave their mark throughout the album, guitar  tones evoking the image of exploding paint cans in a mid-size room, adding to the unruly spirit of the band's albums  and live sets. See, Thee Oh Sees understand the intrinsic value of making a huge mess.</p></div>"|16013.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16013-carrion-crawlerthe-dream/|8.0|Martin Douglas

They've thrown plenty of curve balls since forming in 1992, but after 2005's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1185-pink/"" target=""_blank"">Pink</a></i>, they sped up the shifts and got weirder. The trio is also more willing to revisit its past and recontextualize its output with new styles and approaches. (It can often feel like an archival project, or like you're spying on someone else's <span class=""st"">déjà vu</span>.)</p>
<p>Atsuo (drums/vocals), Wata (guitar/vocals), and Takeshi (bass/vocals) were quiet after 2008's forgettable grab-bag <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11464-smile/"" target=""_blank"">Smile</a></i>, but they've made up for the silence with three 2011 releases, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15460-attention-please-heavy-rocks/"" target=""_blank""><i>Attention Please</i>, <i>Heavy Rocks</i></a> (which echoes the 2002 release of the same name), and <i>New Album</i>, a generically titled collection that reinterprets tracks from those other records: ""Party Boy"", ""Hope"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12534-spoon/"" target=""_blank"">""Spoon""</a>, and ""Les Paul Custom '86"" from <i>AP</i>; ""Jackson Head"" and ""Tu, La La"" from <i>HR II</i>. The 10-song collection, first released in Japan this past March before this rearranged/remastered version, is their most unabashed pop experiment; offering a dollop of sugary atmospherics and dewy hooks. The band insists on labeling this new angle ""extreme,"" though only because it's an extreme shift by a group best known for its doom metal and fuzzed-out rock. (It makes more  sense than you might want to assume that they recently toured with New York City dream-pop group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/216-asobi-seksu/"" target=""_blank"">Asobi  Seksu</a>.)</p>
<p>Conceptually, they were inspired by the use of Vocaloid software in Japanese pop music: the program takes typed lyrics and turns them into a song sung by ""an imaginary anime character vocalist."" <i>New Album</i> does have the feel of sumptuous, otherworldly animation. The band usually self-produces its records but brought on mainstream dance/pop arranger and producer Shinobu Narita, and the guy has a way with Candy Land gloss. All of<i> </i>the <i>Attention Please</i> and <i>Heavy Rocks</i> tracks sound better here--   chewier, more refined nuggets. But in most cases, it's more a   comment on the quality of the other records than a heap of   praise for this one.</p>
<p>When the formula does succeed, the results do dazzle. ""Spoon"" offers a swirl of shoegaze detailed with chimes, synthesizers, atmospheric female vocals, and various bright, shiny things. In this case, as with <i>NA</i>'s other best moments, Boris leave remnants of their usual sound within the gentler field: Bigger-than-twee drums, flanged feedback, and a heavy bass hold the elements together. You also get this in the shredding, cascading guitars of the amped ""Tu, La La"" and the mellower closer, ""Looprider"", a new track that comes off like Boris doing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"" target=""_blank"">Yo La Tengo</a> (via <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a>). The best song, though, is ""Luna"", a rush of gurgling, humming dynamics that continues to hectically spiral upward for its eight minutes and change, creating soaring, stringed, crunchy goodness. (The original appeared on Adult Swim's <i>Metal Swim</i> compilation.) The other real standout-- kinetic, sunburst opener ""Flare""-- didn't appear elsewhere before <i>New Album</i>.</p>
<p>But not everything works so well. Drummer/vocalist Atsuo told <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/free-download-boris-frenetic-flare-20111114#ixzz1eD7Pi6Vi"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a> the two albums that provided much of the source material were  put together from ""one abandoned record."" You don't often see Boris short on ideas, largely because they can't seem to let them go--  even if they're running them into the ground. Here, the experiments too often come off as empty or forced: Decadent on the surface, hollow at the core. The slow, stoned bedroom-psych of the new song ""Pardon?"" bores. The sketchy, dorky techno pop of <i>Attention Please</i>'s ""Les Paul Custom '86"" and <i>Heavy Rocks</i>' Jackson Head"" annoy (Boris as 8-Bit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2872-muse/"" target=""_blank"">Muse</a>?). During these stretches, you can hear the band struggling to write songs from outside their area of expertise. A pop song can look like a  pop song, but that doesn't mean it is one. And as pretty as it can be, <i>New Album</i> is another minor Boris album in a string of minor Boris albums.</p></div>"|16068.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16068-new-album/|6.5|Brandon Stosuy

""It's the only thing I am really influenced by."" That might come as a surprise when you hear the music of her solo project U.S. Girls, which buries simple melodies and vocal hooks under layers of noise and echo. She's even turned pop classics like Bruce Springsteen's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD9FaxLfiuA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Prove it All Night""</a> and B.J. Thomas' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxYqd3P1C6Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Don't Have a Mind of My Own""</a> into basement dirges. But according to Remy, her lo-fi approach is more financial necessity than aesthetic choice. ""I would love to make a really clear recording,"" she said in the same interview. ""It's my dream!""</p>
<p>That dream is realized on <i>U.S. Girls on KRAAK</i>, which is significantly cleaner and less cacophonous than her previous two full-lengths. The increased clarity reveals some true pop gems, especially the stunning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12736-the-island-song/"">""Island Song""</a>, in which Remy's expressive singing sounds both stirring and exultant, inspiring chills and smiles in equal measure. Nearly as good are tracks bearing the influence of doo-wop, Motown, country, and R&amp;B. Remy's love of the latter is especially clear in a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3563-the-residents/"">Residents</a>-like reworking of Brandy and Monica's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va1Y6uAgNJY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Boy Is Mine""</a>.</p>
<p>An album made solely of tunes like that would be strong enough, but what makes <i>U.S. Girls on KRAAK </i>great is how Remy mixes in sounds that are just as odd and idiosyncratic as her previous work. For every melodic nugget, there's a hallucinatory loop, a cloudy drone, or what sounds like the remnants of an exploded pop song-- half of a chorus, shards of a hook-- echoing in the distance. In lesser hands, alternating experiments and tunes could come off forced or gratuitous, but Remy connects them in a way that sounds natural and almost effortless. So when the creepy, voice-in-head ""Wells Dubs"" flows into the Patsy Cline-styled ""Peotone"", it's far from jarring. Instead, you can hear how Remy approaches minimalist loops and pop hooks as if they were the same thing and capable of the same infectious effect.</p>
<p>Remy recently signed U.S. Girls to FatCat, so even glossier, higher-fidelity work might be in her future (and will perhaps come in a longer format, as <i>U.S. Girls on KRAAK </i>lasts only 26 minutes). If so, this album is a perfect launching point in that direction. But it's also a triumph on its own. Remy has widened and universalized her music without losing a drop of what previously made it so special and personal.</p></div>"|16064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16064-us-girls-on-kraak/|7.9|Marc Masters

It was just Joey Burns and John Convertino up on stage, filling out their austere songs with resonant guitar fills and intricate drum patter. More than a decade later, I caught another show, this time at a large club in Washington, D.C., and it couldn't have been more different: The duo was joined by a small orchestra of musicians, who added horns, pedal steel, bass, and various other instruments. The sound was larger and louder, but equally cinematic. That contrast between early Calexico and later is telling. While their lineup has shifted almost constantly over the last few years, absorbing so many musicians in the Tucson scene, Burns and Convertino still approach Southwestern musical and oral traditions through the lens of indie rock records and film scores. And that approach has proved much more durable and rewarding than it might have seemed when they were openers instead of headliners.</p>
<p>So it's fitting that this major retrospective release from the band isn't a greatest hits, but a collection of tour-only LPs, available on vinyl for the first time and summarized on a 16-track CD. Calexico have been releasing these limited-edition LPs on their own Our Soil Our Strength label since 1999, using them as clearinghouses for outtakes, one-offs, live cuts, and mostly studio experiments with various techniques, instruments, and musical genres. Packed together as <i>Road Atlas 1998-2011</i>, they form a compelling history of Burns and Convertino's partnership as they broke free of Giant Sand and Friends of Dean Martinez and gradually discovered what all they could do on their own. The vinyl set is almost a real-time account of a band feeling its way forward, and the fact that they never intended for these LPs to be ""real"" Calexico releases means they didn't have to worry about adhering to any particular approach or dynamic. Calexico could be a slippery entity, reassessing the possibilities with every note. In that regard, these LPs are essential to the band's identity.</p>
<p>Even so, <i>Road Atlas</i> is by its very nature and limited availability (only 1,100 were released) aimed at diehard fans. <i>Selections from Road Atlas</i> proves more accessible, albeit not quite as revelatory or as immersive. Instead of adhering to strict chronology, the CD is sequenced to play like a Calexico album, which means, like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1230-feast-of-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Feast of Wire</a></i> or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12175-carried-to-dust/"" target=""_blank"">Carried to Dust</a></i>, it alternates between vocal-heavy songs and instrumental interstitials. It's not too difficult to distinguish early songs like ""El Morro"" from later tracks like ""Man Made Lake"", but the juxtapositions can be illuminating. With its full sound and Burns' desperate vocals, ""Griptape"", from 2005's <i>The Book and the Canal</i>, sets up the rough terrain of ""Glowing Heart of the World,"" from <i>98-99 Road Map</i>, creating a dynamic that flows from Burns' vocal melody on the former to the lonely guitar strum and crashing finale of the latter. <i>Selections</i> is full of such passages, which blur the timeline and allow the songs to comment on one another.</p>
<p>Even as the band has grown in lineup and in sound, Burns and Convertino remain the defining elements of Calexico's aesthetic. The drummer's complex rhythms allow a song like the live version of ""Lost in Space"" to essentially turn itself inside out, and he adds a jazzy spontaneity even to the rigid beats of ""Boletos"" and ""Entrenando a Los Tigres"". Burns may have started out as a slightly distant frontman with a limited vocal range, which actually reinforced certain themes of in-between-ness in their songs, but somewhere in the early 2000s, he developed a much more expressive delivery and became a much more engaged interpreter. On the dark cover of the 19th-century lullaby ""All the Pretty Horses"", he doesn't shrink from the sing-song melody or from the unsettling lyrics about flies feasting on a dead child. It's a fine showcase for both musicians, actually, as Convertino's drums comment on the verses with muted menace.</p>
<p><i>Selections</i> lacks the impact and narrative thrust of Calexico's best albums, but it doesn't sound like a hastily assembled odds-and-ends collection either. Instead, it showcases one of the band's defining and most distinguishing traits-- its ability to jumble and blur so many different styles and sounds together. Burns and Convertino ambitiously and unself-consciously assert that mariachi, meringue, folk, jazz, rock, soundtrack scores, and studio tinkering all exist on the same plane and all lead ultimately to the same dark desert heart. <i>Road Atlas </i>makes that point with more power and nuance, but <i>Selections</i> is persuasive in its own right.</p></div>"|16060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16060-calexico-selections-from-road-atlas-1998-2011/|7.5|Stephen M.

Of course, when it comes to modern popular figures-- who often court fame and adulation with an obsessiveness that can be fascinating or just plain sad-- Bush herself is something of a mythical beast. <i>50 Words for Snow</i> is only her second album of original material in the last 17 years, and she hasn't performed a full concert since her groundbreaking and theatrical Tour of Life wrapped up its six-week run in 1979. So it's no surprise that she readily sympathizes with the misunderstood monster at the center of ""Wild Man"": ""Lying in my tent, I can hear your cry echoing round the mountainside/ You sound lonely.""</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>50 Words for Snow </i>is teeming with classic Bush-ian characterizations and stories-- fantasies, personifications, ghosts, mysteries, angels, immortals. As quoted in Graeme Thomson's thorough, thoughtful recent biography <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Kate-Bush-Under-Graeme-Thompson/dp/1847729304"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Under the Ivy</a></i>, she explained her attraction to such songwriting: ""[Songs] are just like a little story: you are in a situation, you are this character. This is what happens. End. That's what human beings want desperately. We all love being read stories, and none of us get it anymore."" She's onto something; in our postmodern era, the idea of a tale can seem quaint and simple.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But Bush continues to infuse her narratives with a beguiling complexity while retaining some old-school directness. Because while most of this album's songs can be easily summarized-- ""Snowflake"" chronicles the journey of a piece of snow falling to the ground; ""Lake Tahoe"" tells of a watery spirit searching for her dog; ""Misty"" is the one about the woman who sleeps with a lusty snowman (!)-- they contain wondrous multitudes thanks to the singer's still-expressive voice and knack for uncanny arrangements. And mood. There's an appealing creepiness that runs through this album, one that recalls the atmospheric and conceptual back half of her 1985 masterpiece <i>Hounds of Love</i>. Indeed, when considering this singular artist in 2011, it's difficult to think of worthy points of reference aside from Bush herself; her onetime art-rock compatriots <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"" target=""_blank"">David Bowie</a> and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/1670-peter-gabriel/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Gabriel</a> are currently MIA and in rehash mode, respectively. And while current acts including <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/26688-florence-and-the-machine/"" target=""_blank"">Florence and the Machine</a> are heavily inspired by Bush's early career and spiritual preoccupations, none are quite able to match their idol's particular brand of heart-on-sleeve mysticism. In an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7968-kate-bush/"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> earlier this year, the 53-year-old Bush told me she doesn't listen to much new music, and after listening to the stunningly subtle and understated sounds on <i>Snow, </i>it's easy to believe her.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The album's shortest song, the gorgeous closing piano ballad ""Among Angels"", clocks in at almost seven minutes. ""Misty"" rolls out its brilliant, funny, and bizarrely touching tale across nearly a quarter of an hour. It's not one second too long. During the 12-year gap between 1993's <i>The Red Shoes</i> and 2005's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1181-aerial/"" target=""_blank"">Aerial</a></i> when she was raising her son Bertie, Bush gained a new level of compositional patience. She's now allowing her songs to breathe more than ever-- a fact reinforced by this year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15448-directors-cut/"" target=""_blank"">Director's Cut</a></i>, which found her classing-up and often stretching out songs from 1989's <i>The Sensual World</i> and <i>The Red Shoes</i> via re-recordings. So while ""Misty"" is an eyebrow-raiser about getting very intimate with a cold and white being with a ""crooked mouth full of dead leaves,"" it hardly calls attention to its own eccentricities. Propelled by Bush's languid piano and the jazzy, pitter-pattering drums of veteran stick man (but relatively new Bush recruit) Steve Gadd, the song is about as appealingly grown-up as a song about having sex with a snowman can possibly be. In her early career, Bush sometimes let her zaniness get the better of her, highlighting her tales of sexual taboo and bizarre yarns with look-at-me musical accompaniment and videos. Those days are long gone. And her heightened sophistication works wonders here. So when the song's titular being is nowhere to be found the following morning-- ""the sheets are soaking,"" she sings-- there is nothing gimmicky about her desperation: ""Oh please, can you help me?/ He must be somewhere.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">The ending of that song brings up another common thread through <i>Snow</i>, aside from its blizzard-y climate. This is an album about trying, oftentimes futilely, to find connections-- between Bush and her characters, reality and surreality, love and death. ""Snowflake"" is a duet with her 13-year-old son, where he plays the small fleck of white falling down from the sky, his high-pitched, choir-boy voice hitting the kind of notes his mom was originally famous for. On the track, Bush encourages her son-- ""The world is so loud/ Keep falling/ I'll find you""-- and yet the plaintive piano that steers things is seemingly aware that, once the flake arrives, it'll either melt or disappear among millions of other icy bits. Similarly, while the lake-bound ghost of ""Lake Tahoe"" is overjoyed to find her long-lost dog-- coincidentally named Snowflake-- at the end of the song, the reunion comes with its own specter of bittersweet afterlife. The same sort of disconnect defines ""Snowed in at Wheeler Street"", an eerie duet with Bush's teenage idol Elton John about a star-crossed pair who have ""been in love forever""-- literally. The time-traveling track finds its leads going from ancient Rome to World War II to 9/11, always losing each other along the way. It acts as something of a sequel to Bush's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp43OdtAAkM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Running Up that Hill""</a>, another tale of pained co-dependence. There's no happy ending. ""When we got to the top of the hill/ We saw Rome burning,"" sings Elton.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While much of <i>50 Words for Snow</i> conjures a whited-out, dream-like state of disbelief, it's important to note that Bush does everything in her power to make all the shadowy phantoms here feel real. Her best music, this album included, has the effect of putting one in the kind of treasured, child-like space-- not so much innocent as open to imagination-- that never gets old. ""I have a theory that there are parts of our mental worlds that are still based around the age between five and eight, and we just kind of pretend to be grown-up,"" she recently told <i><a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/kate-bush-the-ice-queen-of-pop-returns-6263559.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Independent</a></i>. ""Our essence is there in a much more powerful way when we're children, and if you're lucky enough to... hang onto who you are, you do have that at your core for the rest of your life."" <i>Snow</i> isn't a blissful retreat to simpler times, though. It's fraught with endings, loss, quiet-- adult things. This is more than pure fantasy. When faced with her unlikely guest on ""Misty"", Bush pinches herself: ""Should be a dream, but I'm not sleepy.""</p></div>"|16067.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16067-50-words-for-snow/|8.5|Ryan Dombal

That will happen when hip-hop's having its RSS-obsessed, gimmick-happy, bloggy moment, and ST and Clova's concerns are consistency and ever so slightly widening the lane they've carved out for themselves. So, on <i>iSLAND-- </i>the equally estimable follow-up to January's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14976-the-one-cohesive/"">THE ONE... COHESIVE</a>-- </i>they're still indefatigably <i>grinding</i>, and just as geeked-up on the fact that people write about them in magazines and on blogs.</p>
<p>But there's something darker creeping into their music here, confounding the occasional misreading of <i>COHESIVE</i>'s glowing, cathartic hip-hop as ""escapist"" or head-in-the-clouds. Forever right there in the background is their keen awareness that, when it comes down to it, they ain't all that important to this rap shit. That's why every interview is a huge deal to them. There's also their past, rife with tragedy and loss-- bouncing around in foster homes, family members lost to cancer and addiction-- which they tastefully reveal only in snippets.</p>
<p>These guys have something to legitimately want to escape, but they also have enough experience to know that things don't always get better-- so they remain sneering, smart products of their environment, always prepared for the worst. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12493-gettin-it-ft-stalley-and-joi-tiffany/"">""Gettin' It""</a>, a team-up with Stalley-- a similarly minded member of rap's scrappy, new sincerity-- ST admits, ""I've been havin' nightmares of being broke at 30."" <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcH4KcrGGZk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A baggy Tame Impala sample</a> suggests a world bigger than regional hip-hop, but the rigid, glitching drums slap those dreams back down to the earth.</p>
<p>G-Side are not cynics, though. They can't help but exude positivity, and the production here, from in-house crew the Block Beataz, as well as Parallel Thought (best known for work with undergrounders like Tame One and C-Rayz Walz), remains typically vibrant. Supported by background singers PH and Joi Tiffany throughout, there's quiet storm R&amp;B on the title track,  Ernie Isley-like guitar on ""Atmosphere"", and a Bacharach-gone-rap sound on ""Stay-cation"". It sounds like hip-hop for the over-30 crowd, which fits G-Side's hard-working, <a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/Come_on_people.html?id=QHx27ANKWRUC"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bill Cosby</a>-meets-<i><a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/From_niggas_to_gods.html?id=n5ciAQAAMAAJ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">From Niggas to Gods</a></i>, ""boot-straps""-tinged individuality.</p>
<p>Wisely, the Huntsville up-and-comers also graft their concerns onto something much larger than their hometown and internet fanbase. They're about to pop off, but they're not quite there, which is a fitting analogue for the United States, which seems to be slowly crawling out from under a recession but shit, man, not soon enough. On ""Rising Sun"" from 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13812-hunstville-international/"">Huntsville International</a></i>, they boasted that they were ""W2 boys""-- regular guys with legal hustles-- but now, they refer to taxes as ""that Uncle Sam scam.""</p>
<p>G-Side are part of the wizened, frustrated working class that can't help but feel like the government's nothing but a money-laundering system for the super rich and therefore, not to be trusted. ""Rabbits"", <i>iSLAND</i>'s finest track, thanks to a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1823-goodie-mob/"" target=""_blank"">Goodie Mob</a>-esque hook and a beyond dusted moan of synths and rattling percussion, is a cruel vision of the world as a place where you hunt or become the hunted. ""16 Shots"" features a song-stealing verse from Bentley that doesn't see the difference between the U.S.-sanctioned murder of Gaddafi and the assassinations of Malcolm and Martin.</p>
<p>Appropriately, this the album where Clova, usually considered the more tormented, lesser of the two MCs, finally gets to shine. Here his voice, which communicates seething disgust with the world, is also so distinct-- a lisping whisper of a rasp-- that it feels painfully sincere, and commands <i>iSLAND</i>. He begins ""Our Thing"" by confessing, ""I hate relationships, never put my heart up in it,"" and ends the song with a uncomfortably calm monologue that invokes the recession while acknowledging the double bind that dedicated hard work is alienating: ""Niggas ain't seeing their kids, niggas ain't with they wives…/ This shit ain't all sweet man, I don't know what the fuck these niggas done told y'all./ We're just out here surviving.""</p>
<p>No matter that, just a few songs before, G-Side wrapped up a mid-album, warm-hearted suite of R&amp;B raps with a love song dedicated to hard work called ""Luv 2 Hustle"". It's not that grinding is what they want to be doing, it's just that, right now, there doesn't seem to be another option.</p></div>"|16053.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16053-g-side-the-island/|7.9|Brandon Soderberg

First off, this is a pretty strange exercise for a lyricist as blunt as Silberman-- rarely does an Antlers song leave much to the imagination in regards to ""what it's about."" Secondly, he went on to call it the result of an obsession with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a>, which also struck me as odd since it sounds almost exactly like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank"">Sigur Rós</a>' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L64BcCRDAE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Svefn-G-Englar""</a>. Lastly, he described the track as ""best heard stoned with friends."" If so, while ""Rolled Together"" is <i>Burst Apart's</i> musical centerpiece, it's the thematic outlier on a record that speaks about sex and alcohol in an unusually austere and often negative manner, endorsing solitude and emotional sobriety as a corrective to the inevitable turmoil each brings. ""Rolled Together"" is better understood as the jumping off point for the odds and sods collection of the <i>(together)</i> EP, since it proves that, despite what <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13196-hospice/"" target=""_blank"">Hospice </a></i>and <i>Burst Apart </i>may have led you to believe, Silberman isn't holed up in a Brooklyn apartment waiting for his heart to be atomized between albums.</p>
<p>That's not to say drugs were clearly a major influence here-- but the indie rock remix album is pretty much on the level of a bowl-passing session or drum circle in terms of pastimes that can be enjoyed only by the people directly participating in them. <i>Hospice </i>and <i>Burst Apart </i>were closed narrative circuits, so any sort of mixed bag from Antlers was bound to be jarring, and indeed, each entry into this hodgepodge of refurbishments, live performances, and outtakes exhibits its own unique set of errant artistic impulses. Take <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12757-vcr-the-xx-cover/"" target=""_blank"">their cover</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"" target=""_blank"">the xx</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI2eO_mNM88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""VCR""</a>, for instance. Look beyond the fact that sampling, remixing, or covering the xx is quickly becoming a tiresome rite of passage and remember why the impact of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13400-xx/"" target=""_blank"">xx</a> </i>continues to manifest: While the songwriting was surely exquisite, its striking minimalism, romantic candor, and sonic intimacy still cuts through the indistinct clutter many of the bands reinterpreting their music don't even realize they're responsible for. Problem isn't that the version here stays true to none of the original's artistic ideals, but it doesn't even sound like ""VCR"" reconfigured to the Antlers specs of passionate, electronic pop-- everything gets soused in a whorl of reverb, to the point where a Doppler effect on Silberman's vocals is the only thing breaking through. For whatever reason, the same tactics are applied to ""I Don’t Want Love (Peter's Version)"".  Where the sleek and silvery contours of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12188-i-dont-want-love/"" target=""_blank"">the original</a> added a layer of resolute determination to the narrator's conflicted take on physical attachment, the solo version just turns maudlin and ponderous under its blown-out echo, something akin to hearing the guy down the hall work through cover versions of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/995-grace-legacy-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Grace</a></i>.</p>
<p>While those two are at odds with their expressive underpinning, the reduxes of ""Parentheses"" and ""French Exit"" unwisely ignore any sort of emotional context altogether, and Silberman simply becomes a trebly sound effect amidst tumbling, metallic loops. But those all serve as prelude to the physical bulk of <i>(together),</i> tied up in three consecutive in-studio collaborations whose combined length nearly equals that of <i>Burst Apart</i>. Take your pick as to what's the more glaring sign of a total quality-control void-- the motley collage serving as the cover art or the nearly two minutes of studio chatter and dead air that precedes each live cut. And yet, they still sound like they could've used more time to plan things out: previously, ""Hounds"" was an impossibly delicate meditation on fresh wounds and codependent fragility, but Nicole Atkins' interjections of husky blues notes triggers the same sort of nose-wrinkling gag reflex of taking a shot of straight vodka. And there's a time and place for Alan Palomo to test out the wild oscillations of his homemade synths-- namely, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28027-neon-indian/"" target=""_blank"">Neon Indian</a> songs. Here, they simply break the beatific spell of ""Rolled Together"" before the Antlers lock into its mixed-meter sway (which features some pretty nifty falsetto swoops), at which point you forget he's even there.</p>
<p>And yet, it's the most blatantly self-indulgent song here that makes <i>(together) </i>ultimately impossible to truly dislike, because it's ultimately impossible to truly take seriously. And that would be a version of ""Parentheses"" with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5531-bear-in-heaven/"" target=""_blank"">Bear in Heaven</a> that would've been the second-longest track on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15996-lou-reed-metallica/"" target=""_blank"">Lulu</a></i>, and to its credit, one of the least grueling<i>. </i>Even in the post-CD age, we've become accustomed to marathon song lengths housing a bit of false advertising, but there's no hidden track, no gaping vacuum of silence, just literally 18 minutes of the Antlers and Bear in Heaven jamming on ""Parentheses"", at its core a three-and-a-half-minute song based on a single drum loop. Frankly, I'm surprised they made it all the way to the end-- halfway through listening, I could get a snack or check my email. They didn't have that option.</p>
<p>Look<i>, (together) </i>is borderline unlistenable taken as a whole, but it actually makes me like <i>Burst Apart </i>even more, since I can add ""tremendously edited"" to its long list of redeeming qualities. And really, it's less of an indictment of the Antlers as it is of <i>(together)</i>'s format. After all, the Antlers have produced a total of two great records since 2009, approximately two more than the entire cottage industry of indie remix albums has in its history. You know, drug abuse, divorce, war, and death all get a bad rap, but somehow they've succeeded in inspiring great art for 40 or so minutes, where letting a couple of friends fuck with your songs has failed about 100% of the time.</p></div>"|16057.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16057-together/|3.0|Ian Cohen

But if you think of it, a camel squeezing through a needle's eye is Monty Python-level absurd. The New Age artist Laraaji (born Edward Larry Gordon) understands such a spiritual dichotomy, offering workshops not just in deep listening but also in deep laughter. His <a href=""http://laraaji.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> even summarizes his skill-set as so: ""Celestial Music Performances and Seriously Playful Laughter Workshops.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">For most music fans, Laraaji remains best known for recording an ambient album with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a> after the latter happened upon the artist improvising on zither in Washington Square Park. The resultant record, <i>Ambient 3: Day of Radiance</i>, catapulted Laraaji into the upper echelons of that then-nascent genre, even if albums like 1978's <i>Celestial Vibration</i> (reissued by Soul Jazz) and 1987's <i>Essence/ Universe</i> transcend all musical nametags, vitamin stores, lucid dreaming practices, and crystal healing sessions to send its listeners up into the ether.</p>
<p>And like other similarly inclined noisemakers (including but not limited to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5513-white-rainbow/"" target=""_blank"">White Rainbow</a>, and Hatchback), when New York's <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/bluescontrol"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blues Control</a> began to explore psychedelic music from the chakra-relaxing end of the musical spectrum, it led them directly to Laraaji's back catalog. Similarly inclined to melodic improvisation, percussive playing, hazy instrument treatments, and sprawling soundscapes-- as evidenced on previous albums like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13272-local-flavor/"" target=""_blank"">Local Flavor</a></i> and<i>""Puff""</i>-- it makes a strange sort of sense that Blues Control would reach out to Laraaji for a collaborative album released as part of the RVNG label's ongoing FRKWYS series.</p>
<p>Sonically, it makes for an exquisite follow-up to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15654-frkwys-vol-7/"" target=""_blank"">the previous entry</a>. Recorded in an upstate studio over the course of a single winter's day, the four tracks that constitute the LP (not to mention the sprawling bonus tracks available via digital download and-- in a nod to the New Age genre-- cassette) feel of a piece. Blues Control's telltale murk is evident from the start of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12710-awakening-day/"" target=""_blank"">""Awakening Day""</a>, somehow discombobulating and evocative, full of echoing percussion and effervescent melodies from Russ Waterhouse's six-string and Lea Cho's electric keyboard. It actually takes a while before Laraaji's strummed zither rises to the surface, only to have the elegant track slowly dissolve into sounds of running water and trickling percussion.</p>
<p>Laraaji's effects-laden strings kick off the 11-minute exploration ""Light Ships"", as do his bellowing vocal improvisations. Piano and zither ebb and rise like oceanic tides, but soon that deep voice of Laraaji's turns into echoing laughter. Another belly laugh emanates from Laraaji on the half-hour bonus track ""Somebody Scream"", and there's also a chuckle as the droning closer ""Freeflow"" fades from view. From where does such mirth arise? There are no definite answers, but surely the body-moving drum shuffle that leads into ""City of Love"" will startle more than a few listeners as the collaboration somehow moves from Earl Young-worthy Philly disco into cascading kalimba and weightless ambiance into the sort of noise gurgle that Blues Control are expert at. Across the four tracks though, it soon becomes hard to distinguish the two separate entities at play, which by this point is to be expected.

Up until a few months ago, when he began work on his debut LP for Merok, Woolhouse was working as a teacher's assistant in a primary school in South London-- widely recognized as the birthplace of dubstep, and home to a few, better-known singer-producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29297-jamie-woon/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie Woon</a>, who offer a similar hybrid of sluggish club beats, expressive sample-cutting, manual key work, and processed vocals.</p>
<p>The project's name is deceptive. Woolhouse doesn't live in the Deptford district of London but in nearby Peckham, and he's no more of a ""goth"" than fellow bedroom producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28780-holy-other/"" target=""_blank"">Holy Other</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28736-ooooo/"" target=""_blank"">oOoOO</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28640-balam-acab/"" target=""_blank"">Balam Acab</a>-- although they do share an affinity for melancholy glamour and chintzy romance. At a time when cultivating an air of mystery has become one of the most transparent PR moves in the business, we can read Deptford Goth's self-branding attempts in one of two ways. Either he is being half-hearted about it, offering up a few easy signifiers for ""dark"" and ""dubsteppy"" in an effort to bait fans of the Tri Angle/Merok contingent, or he is being overly self-conscious and trying to make a statement about how easy it is to get a certain group of people to pay attention these days.</p>
<p>The good news is that Woolhouse seems to have put a lot more thought into the four, quietly action-packed synth-pop numbers on <i>Youth II</i>, his first EP. For someone whose stated roots are in acoustic music, his use of crooked drum programming, buttery synths, and soulful background crooning shows economy and restraint. These qualities are especially evident on downtempo opener <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/deptfordgoth/no-man"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">""No Man""</span></a>, which is full of pregnant pauses. This is music that builds through the addition and subtraction of small details, such as a melismatic glitch in Deptford's de facto Auto-Tune voice, or the zippy, melody that kicks in midway through album single ""Real Love Fantasy""-- a chirpy trance homage to Mariah Carey's ""Fantasy"".</p>
<p>""Time"", by far the EP's standout, contrasts rocky beats and bass wobble with a very large-sounding synth melody. Vague existential musings about a dead-end relationship (""I don't know where I'm going/ Guess I'm leaving/ Time keeps pushing me"") trade off with an almost celebratory refrain: ""I'm a believer."" As with the similarly worded mantra at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12179-believer/""><span class=""s1"">the close</span></a> of John Maus' recent <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15596-we-must-become-the-pitiless-censors-of-ourselves/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves</a></i>, the song's poignance hinges on the impossibility of taking it completely seriously, as the words come from a processed voice that is midway between human and machine.</p>
<p>EP closer <a href=""http://vimeo.com/31192795"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">""Youth II""</span></a> offers another tragi-comic slice of technologically mediated emotion, contrasting his clipped vocalizations with oceanic synth chords that ultimately say so much more. Like electronic soul stylists to whom he is compared (writing for the <i>The</i> <i>Guardian</i>, for example, Paul Lester invokes the ""spectral R&amp;B"" of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">How to Dress Well</a> and Holy Other and ""the dubstep pop"" of Messrs. Blake and Woon""), Deptford Goth's music is partly about making music-- and self-expression in general-- in the digital age, yet another soundtrack for lonely BitTorrent downloading and emoticon-flecked sentimentality. If you're unfamiliar with this sphere, it's a stirring listen; if you know it well, it's less so.</p></div>"|16040.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16040-youth-ii-ep/|6.8|Emilie Friedlander

This box of newly remastered editions of their albums-- four studio records, three compilations of the singles and one-offs that were their greater strength, one live obligation-- would cement their reputation for brilliance and perversity, if it needed cementing.</p>
<p class=""p1"">From the Smiths' first single, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh2bonnjv70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hand in Glove""</a>, in the spring of 1983, to their breakup barely four years later, everything about them seemed like a considered and ingenious decision: their name's undertones of both facelesness and creativity, the way each of their records began with a different sort of guitar tone, the tinted monochrome photos on their sleeves, their proudly ashamed fascination with their home town of Manchester, the three-song EPs they released every few months as bulletins of their evolution, their shoplifting excursions through the used-singles bins of British popular music. (One of the small pleasures of working backward through pop history from the Smiths is stumbling across Sandie Shaw's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiYEpm_1lI8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven Knows I'm Missing Him Now""</a> or Reparata and the Delrons' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYXX_QeRj-o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shoes""</a>, for instance, and thinking <i>ohhh, now I get it</i>.)</p>
<p>The most obvious source of their genius was their singer, lyricist, and spokesman, Morrissey, a career eccentric who idolized Oscar Wilde and took a similar delight in pissing off anyone who had preconceived notions about masculinity. (Or, for that matter, men's singing voices, or what lyrics could and couldn't say, or whether or not it was a good idea to sing lines twice in a row if he was particularly proud of them.) His singing, then as now, was wildly affected and wildly virtuosic, bursting with growls and whoops and sly over-enunciations. And his lyrics and delivery were very, <i>very</i> deeply steeped in the history of gay culture, not least that in that they mimed something like being closeted: Morrissey's claims to celibacy, and early Smiths' lyrical revulsion about sex in general, are kind of hilarious in the light of, say, shirtless Joe Dallessandro appearing on the cover of their first album.</p>
<p>But the Smiths weren't Morrissey-plus-some-musicians, despite what he'd later try to suggest. They had a magnificent rhythm section in bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce, who were unflashy, tough, and supple. And they had guitarist and writer Johnny Marr, who was responsible for at least half of the Smiths' glory. It's hard to neatly describe what was so great about Marr, because he didn't have a particular gimmick or a signature sound; there are virtually no audible guitar solos on Smiths records. Instead, he worked up a different sound and technique for nearly every song in the band's discography--the <i>breadth</i> of his inventiveness is a good part of what's important about him.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that nobody else, before or since, has opened a significant rock album by hammering the bejesus out of the capoed, open-tuned chord that begins <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgNfTx9pGzA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Headmaster Ritual""</a>-- Marr has called his riff what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"" target=""_blank"">Joni Mitchell</a> ""would have done had she been an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"" target=""_blank"">MC5</a> fan."" There also aren't a lot of new wave classics with guitar lines inspired by Ghanaian highlife (and a rhythm section that's basically just playing ""You Can't Hurry Love""), but then there's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGnjrTkv1gs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This Charming Man""</a> to prove the rest of the world wrong. To have come up with the tone and riffs of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0TZZZcC9l4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""What Difference Does It Make?""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfkvPnjb9hs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clPhtitSpes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""London""</a> would be a coup for any guitarist; to have come up with all of them is astonishing.</p>
<p>Released in early 1984 after a couple of singles (and rapturous British press) had built up a buzz around the band, <i>The Smiths</i> is a terrific record, and also a slightly frustrating one: It's not quite the Smiths as we know them. (If they'd all perished in a terrible double-decker bus plunge immediately after its release, it'd certainly still be some kind of cult item, but we'd think of them as a much grimmer band, much more rooted in the smoky, post-punk worldview.) Starting a debut album with a slow, six-minute song that hints at working out memories of child abuse through painful sex (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxLFav1Z9EY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Reel Around the Fountain""</a>) was a particularly audacious move, undercut by overdubbed lounge-act keyboards played by Paul Carrack (the guy who'd sung Squeeze's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PmtS_qMdXg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tempted""</a>). Most of Morrissey's lyrics on <i>The Smiths</i>, in fact, allude to awful doings involving adults and children-- its closing track, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9DH0_b3F1c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Suffer Little Children""</a>, is explicitly about the Moors murders.</p>
<p>Musically, they weren't entirely on track yet: Mike Joyce's drums have that big, early-MTV boom, Morrissey's showing off his voice's capabilities even when he doesn't have much of a melody to apply them to, and the bizarre punk rock speed-up of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqelcupWcPg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Miserable Lie""</a> doesn't particularly suit them. But their aesthetic was already wholly formed-- the album's murk, sexual frankness, and situational ambiguity were a reaction against the British pop landscape of its time. The Smiths were already a singles band, too, and the album goes from ""quite good"" to ""remarkable"" halfway through, when Marr breaks into the delicious opening riff of ""This Charming Man"" and Morrissey finally gets laid.</p>
<p>Released nine months after <i>The Smiths</i>, <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, a thrown-together collection of radio sessions predating the studio album and tracks from singles, could've been a lesser companion piece to it. Instead, it's a masterpiece, a snapshot of a band moving too quickly to get a bead on. It's a much happier album than <i>The Smiths</i>-- the sequencing turns <i>Hatful</i>'s miscellany into something like a narrative about pickups and breakups and relationships, and ending with the combination of ""Reel Around the Fountain"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMQbzLrvwlE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want""</a> pulls off the neat trick of casting both of them as hopeful songs. The BBC session tracks have an offhanded spark and swing unmatched in the Smiths' catalog; the recent singles <i>Hatful</i> collects have a sense of delight that made the band whole. (""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"" may be the most lighthearted song ever written about suffocating despair.) How wonderful were they at that moment? Both <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U5HpeA_WSo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How Soon Is Now?""</a> and ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" had just seen release for the first time as the <i>B-sides</i> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMwUCmuND8Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""William, It Was Really Nothing""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Meat Is Murder</i>-- which followed <i>Hatful</i> by a mere three months-- is better recorded than <i>The Smiths</i>, although it's more a bunch of songs that didn't fit on singles than a coherent album. When it's good, it's great: ""The Headmaster Ritual"", especially, is full of chills-down-the-spine moments from Morrissey (the wordless, yodeling chorus that rhymes with ""I want to go home/ I don't want to stay,"" the second verse's thrilling deviations from the first). <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd-RPrpY1j0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""</a> is a legitimately uncanny slow one that builds up to a bullseye triple-entendre-- ""it was dark as I drove the point home""-- then recedes, surges back up, and fades away again. Still, Morrissey's often painfully out of tune on <i>Meat</i>'s lesser songs, and a lot of tracks here stretch out at considerable length. That works remarkably well for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDkDiC0BxGQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Barbarism Begins at Home""</a>, seven minutes of tense funk, but flops for the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpkPWwTJTSw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>'s tedious, eye-rollingly earnest animal-rights manifesto.</p>
<p>1986's <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> is the one studio album where the Smiths are operating at top capacity all the way through: they're aggressive, funny, rueful, tuneful, inventive, cryptic, tender, murderously furious at everything from Dear Old Blighty to their own miserablist selves, and let's underscore that ""funny"" again. Morrissey's refusing to take anything entirely seriously, particularly matters of life and death (you can practically hear him waggle his eyebrow as he tells Her Majesty ""you should hear me play <i>pi-anner</i>"")-- he's got his wrist taped to his forehead, but he's giggling about it. He's singing magnificently (those falsetto gasps in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYp2LGKOF_M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Boy with the Thorn in His Side""</a> are unbeatable), Marr's redefining ""guitar hero"" to have absolutely nothing to do with machismo (he effectively invents reggaebilly on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ownZDWNIRs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Frankly, Mr. Shankly""</a>), and the band's at ease with its capacity to speak for every sullen, curious, baffled teenager. Morrissey and Marr's production sounds remarkably undated, too-- the marvelous line in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqZdC6qXhLI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bigmouth Strikes Again""</a> about Joan of Arc's Walkman is now an anachronism twice over, but otherwise the album could pass for a really great product of 2011.</p>
<p>Even after <i>The Queen Is Dead</i>, the Smiths kept cranking out those three-song EPs, so two competing anthologies of their creative overflow appeared in early 1987. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> came out in the U.K. five weeks before <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> appeared in the U.S. They've got 12 songs in common, some in slightly different versions; of the five other songs on <i>World</i>, three are reprised from <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> and one from <i>Meat Is Murder</i>, and the last is an instrumental. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> starts very strongly-- its first half is singles and might-as-well-have-been-singles-- and then dissolves into a mess of slow, maudlin songs, interrupted by the chirruping of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giT_zL8YIcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Louder Than Bombs</i> augments the 12 core tracks with the not-yet-on-album-in-America songs from <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, along with the material from the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzXCvCNDRJQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sheila Take a Bow""</a> single. It's much better sequenced than <i>World</i>, arranged into four six-song suites on the original double LP: hard-headed rockers about being a socially maladjusted freak (plus ""Half a Person"", a soft-skinned lament about the same thing); warped pop songs about frustrated desire (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyJdiE0l23c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Panic""</a>, a rewrite of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"" target=""_blank"">T. Rex</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpA-7dNuobU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Metal Guru""</a> about the same thing); guitar showcases about being trapped inside one's own thoughts (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMY4W0l4peY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ask""</a>, a singalong about how hot sex could free you, yes you, from that trap); and a progressively more relaxed series of meditations about how even hot sex may still not make you want to live.</p>
<p>The Smiths broke up a few months after they recorded 1987's <i>Strangeways, Here We Come</i>, so it's tempting to hear it as a premonition of the band's doom, as opposed to the album with ""dead"" in its title, the album with ""murder"" in its title, or the album about murdered children. Even more than that, though, it's the Smiths' album about desperately trying not to repeat themselves: Their final single couldn't have had a cleverer title than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81cfD72BlQY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stop Me if You Think You've Heard This One Before""</a>. Morrissey's shifting into his now-familiar lyrical mode of deliberate self-parody (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBc_iyDvs4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Death at One's Elbow""</a> is effectively a camped-up burlesque of ""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""); Marr's doing his best to avoid the tingling Rickenbacker picking that was the closest thing he had to a default sound. That's generally a good idea here-- the autoharp he plays on the group's leavetaking, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAytConbtcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Won't Share You""</a>, is thrilling-- although the orchestral whomp on a few songs is overdoing it. And the fact that they're devoting so much energy to a song about being annoyed by the record business suggests that they might have been about to pass their sell-by date anyway.</p>
<p>To be fair, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08Zc17YQzdk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Paint a Vulgar Picture""</a> is both funny and painfully accurate about the fate of the Smiths' music after the Morrissey/Marr team split. <i>Rank</i>, released after Morrissey had launched his solo career, is useful as the Smiths' only full-on live album, and as a document of the brief era when Craig Gannon was their second guitarist (the <i>Queen Is Dead</i> tour, basically). It's also a contractually obligated piece of barrel-scraping, and the onstage Smiths were not what they'd once been-- they would play only six more complete gigs after the one recorded here. They're still pretty on-point, and it's fun to hear them swing through a verse of Elvis Presley's ""(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame"" as an introduction to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r57Lg7YTJmk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rusholme Ruffians""</a>, but it's uncharacteristically inessential.</p>
<p>And then there was nothing left to do but reissue! Repackage! Remaster! <i>Complete</i> follows the <i>Best</i>... sets, <i>Singles</i>, <i>The Very Best of the Smiths</i>, <i>The Sound of the Smiths,</i> and a few other cash-ins (even this set has an ultra-limited and exceedingly pricey deluxe version). The new mastering job, by Frank Arkwright working with Marr, actually is really good: loud but not bomb-level loud, clear, and airy. (<i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, in particular, is dramatically improved from its previous incarnations.) On the other hand, ""Complete"" is a profoundly inaccurate description of this set. Including both <i>The World Won't Listen</i> and <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> exceeds completeness; omitting the band's non-album tracks means the loss of some decent-to-terrific live B-sides, a bit of later-period filler, and the magnificent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRghlld8HU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jeane""</a>. Well, they never claimed not to be perverse.</p></div>"|16027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16027-the-smiths-complete/|8.1|Douglas Wolk

<p>Musically, they weren't entirely on track yet: Mike Joyce's drums have that big, early-MTV boom, Morrissey's showing off his voice's capabilities even when he doesn't have much of a melody to apply them to, and the bizarre punk rock speed-up of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqelcupWcPg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Miserable Lie""</a> doesn't particularly suit them. But their aesthetic was already wholly formed-- the album's murk, sexual frankness, and situational ambiguity were a reaction against the British pop landscape of its time. The Smiths were already a singles band, too, and the album goes from ""quite good"" to ""remarkable"" halfway through, when Marr breaks into the delicious opening riff of ""This Charming Man"" and Morrissey finally gets laid.</p>
<p>Released nine months after <i>The Smiths</i>, <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, a thrown-together collection of radio sessions predating the studio album and tracks from singles, could've been a lesser companion piece to it. Instead, it's a masterpiece, a snapshot of a band moving too quickly to get a bead on. It's a much happier album than <i>The Smiths</i>-- the sequencing turns <i>Hatful</i>'s miscellany into something like a narrative about pickups and breakups and relationships, and ending with the combination of ""Reel Around the Fountain"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMQbzLrvwlE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want""</a> pulls off the neat trick of casting both of them as hopeful songs. The BBC session tracks have an offhanded spark and swing unmatched in the Smiths' catalog; the recent singles <i>Hatful</i> collects have a sense of delight that made the band whole. (""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"" may be the most lighthearted song ever written about suffocating despair.) How wonderful were they at that moment? Both <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U5HpeA_WSo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How Soon Is Now?""</a> and ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" had just seen release for the first time as the <i>B-sides</i> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMwUCmuND8Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""William, It Was Really Nothing""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Meat Is Murder</i>-- which followed <i>Hatful</i> by a mere three months-- is better recorded than <i>The Smiths</i>, although it's more a bunch of songs that didn't fit on singles than a coherent album. When it's good, it's great: ""The Headmaster Ritual"", especially, is full of chills-down-the-spine moments from Morrissey (the wordless, yodeling chorus that rhymes with ""I want to go home/ I don't want to stay,"" the second verse's thrilling deviations from the first). <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd-RPrpY1j0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""</a> is a legitimately uncanny slow one that builds up to a bullseye triple-entendre-- ""it was dark as I drove the point home""-- then recedes, surges back up, and fades away again. Still, Morrissey's often painfully out of tune on <i>Meat</i>'s lesser songs, and a lot of tracks here stretch out at considerable length. That works remarkably well for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDkDiC0BxGQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Barbarism Begins at Home""</a>, seven minutes of tense funk, but flops for the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpkPWwTJTSw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>'s tedious, eye-rollingly earnest animal-rights manifesto.</p>
<p>1986's <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> is the one studio album where the Smiths are operating at top capacity all the way through: they're aggressive, funny, rueful, tuneful, inventive, cryptic, tender, murderously furious at everything from Dear Old Blighty to their own miserablist selves, and let's underscore that ""funny"" again. Morrissey's refusing to take anything entirely seriously, particularly matters of life and death (you can practically hear him waggle his eyebrow as he tells Her Majesty ""you should hear me play <i>pi-anner</i>"")-- he's got his wrist taped to his forehead, but he's giggling about it. He's singing magnificently (those falsetto gasps in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYp2LGKOF_M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Boy with the Thorn in His Side""</a> are unbeatable), Marr's redefining ""guitar hero"" to have absolutely nothing to do with machismo (he effectively invents reggaebilly on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ownZDWNIRs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Frankly, Mr. Shankly""</a>), and the band's at ease with its capacity to speak for every sullen, curious, baffled teenager. Morrissey and Marr's production sounds remarkably undated, too-- the marvelous line in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqZdC6qXhLI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bigmouth Strikes Again""</a> about Joan of Arc's Walkman is now an anachronism twice over, but otherwise the album could pass for a really great product of 2011.</p>
<p>Even after <i>The Queen Is Dead</i>, the Smiths kept cranking out those three-song EPs, so two competing anthologies of their creative overflow appeared in early 1987. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> came out in the U.K. five weeks before <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> appeared in the U.S. They've got 12 songs in common, some in slightly different versions; of the five other songs on <i>World</i>, three are reprised from <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> and one from <i>Meat Is Murder</i>, and the last is an instrumental. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> starts very strongly-- its first half is singles and might-as-well-have-been-singles-- and then dissolves into a mess of slow, maudlin songs, interrupted by the chirruping of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giT_zL8YIcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Louder Than Bombs</i> augments the 12 core tracks with the not-yet-on-album-in-America songs from <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, along with the material from the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzXCvCNDRJQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sheila Take a Bow""</a> single. It's much better sequenced than <i>World</i>, arranged into four six-song suites on the original double LP: hard-headed rockers about being a socially maladjusted freak (plus ""Half a Person"", a soft-skinned lament about the same thing); warped pop songs about frustrated desire (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyJdiE0l23c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Panic""</a>, a rewrite of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"" target=""_blank"">T. Rex</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpA-7dNuobU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Metal Guru""</a> about the same thing); guitar showcases about being trapped inside one's own thoughts (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMY4W0l4peY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ask""</a>, a singalong about how hot sex could free you, yes you, from that trap); and a progressively more relaxed series of meditations about how even hot sex may still not make you want to live.</p>
<p>The Smiths broke up a few months after they recorded 1987's <i>Strangeways, Here We Come</i>, so it's tempting to hear it as a premonition of the band's doom, as opposed to the album with ""dead"" in its title, the album with ""murder"" in its title, or the album about murdered children. Even more than that, though, it's the Smiths' album about desperately trying not to repeat themselves: Their final single couldn't have had a cleverer title than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81cfD72BlQY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stop Me if You Think You've Heard This One Before""</a>. Morrissey's shifting into his now-familiar lyrical mode of deliberate self-parody (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBc_iyDvs4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Death at One's Elbow""</a> is effectively a camped-up burlesque of ""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""); Marr's doing his best to avoid the tingling Rickenbacker picking that was the closest thing he had to a default sound. That's generally a good idea here-- the autoharp he plays on the group's leavetaking, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAytConbtcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Won't Share You""</a>, is thrilling-- although the orchestral whomp on a few songs is overdoing it. And the fact that they're devoting so much energy to a song about being annoyed by the record business suggests that they might have been about to pass their sell-by date anyway.</p>
<p>To be fair, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08Zc17YQzdk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Paint a Vulgar Picture""</a> is both funny and painfully accurate about the fate of the Smiths' music after the Morrissey/Marr team split. <i>Rank</i>, released after Morrissey had launched his solo career, is useful as the Smiths' only full-on live album, and as a document of the brief era when Craig Gannon was their second guitarist (the <i>Queen Is Dead</i> tour, basically). It's also a contractually obligated piece of barrel-scraping, and the onstage Smiths were not what they'd once been-- they would play only six more complete gigs after the one recorded here. They're still pretty on-point, and it's fun to hear them swing through a verse of Elvis Presley's ""(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame"" as an introduction to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r57Lg7YTJmk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rusholme Ruffians""</a>, but it's uncharacteristically inessential.</p>
<p>And then there was nothing left to do but reissue! Repackage! Remaster! <i>Complete</i> follows the <i>Best</i>... sets, <i>Singles</i>, <i>The Very Best of the Smiths</i>, <i>The Sound of the Smiths,</i> and a few other cash-ins (even this set has an ultra-limited and exceedingly pricey deluxe version). The new mastering job, by Frank Arkwright working with Marr, actually is really good: loud but not bomb-level loud, clear, and airy. (<i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, in particular, is dramatically improved from its previous incarnations.) On the other hand, ""Complete"" is a profoundly inaccurate description of this set. Including both <i>The World Won't Listen</i> and <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> exceeds completeness; omitting the band's non-album tracks means the loss of some decent-to-terrific live B-sides, a bit of later-period filler, and the magnificent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRghlld8HU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jeane""</a>. Well, they never claimed not to be perverse.</p></div>"|16027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16027-the-smiths-complete/|8.8|Douglas Wolk

This box of newly remastered editions of their albums-- four studio records, three compilations of the singles and one-offs that were their greater strength, one live obligation-- would cement their reputation for brilliance and perversity, if it needed cementing.</p>
<p class=""p1"">From the Smiths' first single, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh2bonnjv70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hand in Glove""</a>, in the spring of 1983, to their breakup barely four years later, everything about them seemed like a considered and ingenious decision: their name's undertones of both facelesness and creativity, the way each of their records began with a different sort of guitar tone, the tinted monochrome photos on their sleeves, their proudly ashamed fascination with their home town of Manchester, the three-song EPs they released every few months as bulletins of their evolution, their shoplifting excursions through the used-singles bins of British popular music. (One of the small pleasures of working backward through pop history from the Smiths is stumbling across Sandie Shaw's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiYEpm_1lI8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven Knows I'm Missing Him Now""</a> or Reparata and the Delrons' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYXX_QeRj-o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shoes""</a>, for instance, and thinking <i>ohhh, now I get it</i>.)</p>
<p>The most obvious source of their genius was their singer, lyricist, and spokesman, Morrissey, a career eccentric who idolized Oscar Wilde and took a similar delight in pissing off anyone who had preconceived notions about masculinity. (Or, for that matter, men's singing voices, or what lyrics could and couldn't say, or whether or not it was a good idea to sing lines twice in a row if he was particularly proud of them.) His singing, then as now, was wildly affected and wildly virtuosic, bursting with growls and whoops and sly over-enunciations. And his lyrics and delivery were very, <i>very</i> deeply steeped in the history of gay culture, not least that in that they mimed something like being closeted: Morrissey's claims to celibacy, and early Smiths' lyrical revulsion about sex in general, are kind of hilarious in the light of, say, shirtless Joe Dallessandro appearing on the cover of their first album.</p>
<p>But the Smiths weren't Morrissey-plus-some-musicians, despite what he'd later try to suggest. They had a magnificent rhythm section in bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce, who were unflashy, tough, and supple. And they had guitarist and writer Johnny Marr, who was responsible for at least half of the Smiths' glory. It's hard to neatly describe what was so great about Marr, because he didn't have a particular gimmick or a signature sound; there are virtually no audible guitar solos on Smiths records. Instead, he worked up a different sound and technique for nearly every song in the band's discography--the <i>breadth</i> of his inventiveness is a good part of what's important about him.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that nobody else, before or since, has opened a significant rock album by hammering the bejesus out of the capoed, open-tuned chord that begins <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgNfTx9pGzA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Headmaster Ritual""</a>-- Marr has called his riff what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"" target=""_blank"">Joni Mitchell</a> ""would have done had she been an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"" target=""_blank"">MC5</a> fan."" There also aren't a lot of new wave classics with guitar lines inspired by Ghanaian highlife (and a rhythm section that's basically just playing ""You Can't Hurry Love""), but then there's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGnjrTkv1gs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This Charming Man""</a> to prove the rest of the world wrong. To have come up with the tone and riffs of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0TZZZcC9l4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""What Difference Does It Make?""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfkvPnjb9hs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clPhtitSpes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""London""</a> would be a coup for any guitarist; to have come up with all of them is astonishing.</p>
<p>Released in early 1984 after a couple of singles (and rapturous British press) had built up a buzz around the band, <i>The Smiths</i> is a terrific record, and also a slightly frustrating one: It's not quite the Smiths as we know them. (If they'd all perished in a terrible double-decker bus plunge immediately after its release, it'd certainly still be some kind of cult item, but we'd think of them as a much grimmer band, much more rooted in the smoky, post-punk worldview.) Starting a debut album with a slow, six-minute song that hints at working out memories of child abuse through painful sex (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxLFav1Z9EY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Reel Around the Fountain""</a>) was a particularly audacious move, undercut by overdubbed lounge-act keyboards played by Paul Carrack (the guy who'd sung Squeeze's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PmtS_qMdXg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tempted""</a>).

<p>Musically, they weren't entirely on track yet: Mike Joyce's drums have that big, early-MTV boom, Morrissey's showing off his voice's capabilities even when he doesn't have much of a melody to apply them to, and the bizarre punk rock speed-up of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqelcupWcPg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Miserable Lie""</a> doesn't particularly suit them.

<p>Released nine months after <i>The Smiths</i>, <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, a thrown-together collection of radio sessions predating the studio album and tracks from singles, could've been a lesser companion piece to it. Instead, it's a masterpiece, a snapshot of a band moving too quickly to get a bead on. It's a much happier album than <i>The Smiths</i>-- the sequencing turns <i>Hatful</i>'s miscellany into something like a narrative about pickups and breakups and relationships, and ending with the combination of ""Reel Around the Fountain"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMQbzLrvwlE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want""</a> pulls off the neat trick of casting both of them as hopeful songs.

This box of newly remastered editions of their albums-- four studio records, three compilations of the singles and one-offs that were their greater strength, one live obligation-- would cement their reputation for brilliance and perversity, if it needed cementing.</p>
<p class=""p1"">From the Smiths' first single, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh2bonnjv70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hand in Glove""</a>, in the spring of 1983, to their breakup barely four years later, everything about them seemed like a considered and ingenious decision: their name's undertones of both facelesness and creativity, the way each of their records began with a different sort of guitar tone, the tinted monochrome photos on their sleeves, their proudly ashamed fascination with their home town of Manchester, the three-song EPs they released every few months as bulletins of their evolution, their shoplifting excursions through the used-singles bins of British popular music. (One of the small pleasures of working backward through pop history from the Smiths is stumbling across Sandie Shaw's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiYEpm_1lI8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven Knows I'm Missing Him Now""</a> or Reparata and the Delrons' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYXX_QeRj-o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shoes""</a>, for instance, and thinking <i>ohhh, now I get it</i>.)</p>
<p>The most obvious source of their genius was their singer, lyricist, and spokesman, Morrissey, a career eccentric who idolized Oscar Wilde and took a similar delight in pissing off anyone who had preconceived notions about masculinity. (Or, for that matter, men's singing voices, or what lyrics could and couldn't say, or whether or not it was a good idea to sing lines twice in a row if he was particularly proud of them.) His singing, then as now, was wildly affected and wildly virtuosic, bursting with growls and whoops and sly over-enunciations. And his lyrics and delivery were very, <i>very</i> deeply steeped in the history of gay culture, not least that in that they mimed something like being closeted: Morrissey's claims to celibacy, and early Smiths' lyrical revulsion about sex in general, are kind of hilarious in the light of, say, shirtless Joe Dallessandro appearing on the cover of their first album.</p>
<p>But the Smiths weren't Morrissey-plus-some-musicians, despite what he'd later try to suggest. They had a magnificent rhythm section in bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce, who were unflashy, tough, and supple. And they had guitarist and writer Johnny Marr, who was responsible for at least half of the Smiths' glory. It's hard to neatly describe what was so great about Marr, because he didn't have a particular gimmick or a signature sound; there are virtually no audible guitar solos on Smiths records. Instead, he worked up a different sound and technique for nearly every song in the band's discography--the <i>breadth</i> of his inventiveness is a good part of what's important about him.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that nobody else, before or since, has opened a significant rock album by hammering the bejesus out of the capoed, open-tuned chord that begins <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgNfTx9pGzA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Headmaster Ritual""</a>-- Marr has called his riff what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"" target=""_blank"">Joni Mitchell</a> ""would have done had she been an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"" target=""_blank"">MC5</a> fan."" There also aren't a lot of new wave classics with guitar lines inspired by Ghanaian highlife (and a rhythm section that's basically just playing ""You Can't Hurry Love""), but then there's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGnjrTkv1gs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This Charming Man""</a> to prove the rest of the world wrong. To have come up with the tone and riffs of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0TZZZcC9l4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""What Difference Does It Make?""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfkvPnjb9hs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clPhtitSpes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""London""</a> would be a coup for any guitarist; to have come up with all of them is astonishing.</p>
<p>Released in early 1984 after a couple of singles (and rapturous British press) had built up a buzz around the band, <i>The Smiths</i> is a terrific record, and also a slightly frustrating one: It's not quite the Smiths as we know them. (If they'd all perished in a terrible double-decker bus plunge immediately after its release, it'd certainly still be some kind of cult item, but we'd think of them as a much grimmer band, much more rooted in the smoky, post-punk worldview.) Starting a debut album with a slow, six-minute song that hints at working out memories of child abuse through painful sex (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxLFav1Z9EY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Reel Around the Fountain""</a>) was a particularly audacious move, undercut by overdubbed lounge-act keyboards played by Paul Carrack (the guy who'd sung Squeeze's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PmtS_qMdXg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tempted""</a>). Most of Morrissey's lyrics on <i>The Smiths</i>, in fact, allude to awful doings involving adults and children-- its closing track, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9DH0_b3F1c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Suffer Little Children""</a>, is explicitly about the Moors murders.</p>
<p>Musically, they weren't entirely on track yet: Mike Joyce's drums have that big, early-MTV boom, Morrissey's showing off his voice's capabilities even when he doesn't have much of a melody to apply them to, and the bizarre punk rock speed-up of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqelcupWcPg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Miserable Lie""</a> doesn't particularly suit them. But their aesthetic was already wholly formed-- the album's murk, sexual frankness, and situational ambiguity were a reaction against the British pop landscape of its time. The Smiths were already a singles band, too, and the album goes from ""quite good"" to ""remarkable"" halfway through, when Marr breaks into the delicious opening riff of ""This Charming Man"" and Morrissey finally gets laid.</p>
<p>Released nine months after <i>The Smiths</i>, <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, a thrown-together collection of radio sessions predating the studio album and tracks from singles, could've been a lesser companion piece to it. Instead, it's a masterpiece, a snapshot of a band moving too quickly to get a bead on. It's a much happier album than <i>The Smiths</i>-- the sequencing turns <i>Hatful</i>'s miscellany into something like a narrative about pickups and breakups and relationships, and ending with the combination of ""Reel Around the Fountain"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMQbzLrvwlE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want""</a> pulls off the neat trick of casting both of them as hopeful songs. The BBC session tracks have an offhanded spark and swing unmatched in the Smiths' catalog; the recent singles <i>Hatful</i> collects have a sense of delight that made the band whole. (""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"" may be the most lighthearted song ever written about suffocating despair.) How wonderful were they at that moment? Both <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U5HpeA_WSo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How Soon Is Now?""</a> and ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" had just seen release for the first time as the <i>B-sides</i> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMwUCmuND8Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""William, It Was Really Nothing""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Meat Is Murder</i>-- which followed <i>Hatful</i> by a mere three months-- is better recorded than <i>The Smiths</i>, although it's more a bunch of songs that didn't fit on singles than a coherent album. When it's good, it's great: ""The Headmaster Ritual"", especially, is full of chills-down-the-spine moments from Morrissey (the wordless, yodeling chorus that rhymes with ""I want to go home/ I don't want to stay,"" the second verse's thrilling deviations from the first). <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd-RPrpY1j0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""</a> is a legitimately uncanny slow one that builds up to a bullseye triple-entendre-- ""it was dark as I drove the point home""-- then recedes, surges back up, and fades away again. Still, Morrissey's often painfully out of tune on <i>Meat</i>'s lesser songs, and a lot of tracks here stretch out at considerable length. That works remarkably well for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDkDiC0BxGQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Barbarism Begins at Home""</a>, seven minutes of tense funk, but flops for the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpkPWwTJTSw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>'s tedious, eye-rollingly earnest animal-rights manifesto.</p>
<p>1986's <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> is the one studio album where the Smiths are operating at top capacity all the way through: they're aggressive, funny, rueful, tuneful, inventive, cryptic, tender, murderously furious at everything from Dear Old Blighty to their own miserablist selves, and let's underscore that ""funny"" again. Morrissey's refusing to take anything entirely seriously, particularly matters of life and death (you can practically hear him waggle his eyebrow as he tells Her Majesty ""you should hear me play <i>pi-anner</i>"")-- he's got his wrist taped to his forehead, but he's giggling about it. He's singing magnificently (those falsetto gasps in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYp2LGKOF_M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Boy with the Thorn in His Side""</a> are unbeatable), Marr's redefining ""guitar hero"" to have absolutely nothing to do with machismo (he effectively invents reggaebilly on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ownZDWNIRs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Frankly, Mr. Shankly""</a>), and the band's at ease with its capacity to speak for every sullen, curious, baffled teenager. Morrissey and Marr's production sounds remarkably undated, too-- the marvelous line in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqZdC6qXhLI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bigmouth Strikes Again""</a> about Joan of Arc's Walkman is now an anachronism twice over, but otherwise the album could pass for a really great product of 2011.</p>
<p>Even after <i>The Queen Is Dead</i>, the Smiths kept cranking out those three-song EPs, so two competing anthologies of their creative overflow appeared in early 1987. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> came out in the U.K. five weeks before <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> appeared in the U.S. They've got 12 songs in common, some in slightly different versions; of the five other songs on <i>World</i>, three are reprised from <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> and one from <i>Meat Is Murder</i>, and the last is an instrumental. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> starts very strongly-- its first half is singles and might-as-well-have-been-singles-- and then dissolves into a mess of slow, maudlin songs, interrupted by the chirruping of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giT_zL8YIcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Louder Than Bombs</i> augments the 12 core tracks with the not-yet-on-album-in-America songs from <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, along with the material from the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzXCvCNDRJQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sheila Take a Bow""</a> single. It's much better sequenced than <i>World</i>, arranged into four six-song suites on the original double LP: hard-headed rockers about being a socially maladjusted freak (plus ""Half a Person"", a soft-skinned lament about the same thing); warped pop songs about frustrated desire (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyJdiE0l23c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Panic""</a>, a rewrite of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"" target=""_blank"">T. Rex</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpA-7dNuobU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Metal Guru""</a> about the same thing); guitar showcases about being trapped inside one's own thoughts (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMY4W0l4peY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ask""</a>, a singalong about how hot sex could free you, yes you, from that trap); and a progressively more relaxed series of meditations about how even hot sex may still not make you want to live.</p>
<p>The Smiths broke up a few months after they recorded 1987's <i>Strangeways, Here We Come</i>, so it's tempting to hear it as a premonition of the band's doom, as opposed to the album with ""dead"" in its title, the album with ""murder"" in its title, or the album about murdered children. Even more than that, though, it's the Smiths' album about desperately trying not to repeat themselves: Their final single couldn't have had a cleverer title than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81cfD72BlQY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stop Me if You Think You've Heard This One Before""</a>. Morrissey's shifting into his now-familiar lyrical mode of deliberate self-parody (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBc_iyDvs4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Death at One's Elbow""</a> is effectively a camped-up burlesque of ""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""); Marr's doing his best to avoid the tingling Rickenbacker picking that was the closest thing he had to a default sound. That's generally a good idea here-- the autoharp he plays on the group's leavetaking, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAytConbtcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Won't Share You""</a>, is thrilling-- although the orchestral whomp on a few songs is overdoing it. And the fact that they're devoting so much energy to a song about being annoyed by the record business suggests that they might have been about to pass their sell-by date anyway.</p>
<p>To be fair, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08Zc17YQzdk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Paint a Vulgar Picture""</a> is both funny and painfully accurate about the fate of the Smiths' music after the Morrissey/Marr team split. <i>Rank</i>, released after Morrissey had launched his solo career, is useful as the Smiths' only full-on live album, and as a document of the brief era when Craig Gannon was their second guitarist (the <i>Queen Is Dead</i> tour, basically). It's also a contractually obligated piece of barrel-scraping, and the onstage Smiths were not what they'd once been-- they would play only six more complete gigs after the one recorded here. They're still pretty on-point, and it's fun to hear them swing through a verse of Elvis Presley's ""(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame"" as an introduction to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r57Lg7YTJmk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rusholme Ruffians""</a>, but it's uncharacteristically inessential.</p>
<p>And then there was nothing left to do but reissue! Repackage! Remaster! <i>Complete</i> follows the <i>Best</i>... sets, <i>Singles</i>, <i>The Very Best of the Smiths</i>, <i>The Sound of the Smiths,</i> and a few other cash-ins (even this set has an ultra-limited and exceedingly pricey deluxe version). The new mastering job, by Frank Arkwright working with Marr, actually is really good: loud but not bomb-level loud, clear, and airy. (<i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, in particular, is dramatically improved from its previous incarnations.) On the other hand, ""Complete"" is a profoundly inaccurate description of this set. Including both <i>The World Won't Listen</i> and <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> exceeds completeness; omitting the band's non-album tracks means the loss of some decent-to-terrific live B-sides, a bit of later-period filler, and the magnificent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRghlld8HU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jeane""</a>.

<p>Even after <i>The Queen Is Dead</i>, the Smiths kept cranking out those three-song EPs, so two competing anthologies of their creative overflow appeared in early 1987. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> came out in the U.K. five weeks before <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> appeared in the U.S. They've got 12 songs in common, some in slightly different versions; of the five other songs on <i>World</i>, three are reprised from <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> and one from <i>Meat Is Murder</i>, and the last is an instrumental. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> starts very strongly-- its first half is singles and might-as-well-have-been-singles-- and then dissolves into a mess of slow, maudlin songs, interrupted by the chirruping of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giT_zL8YIcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Louder Than Bombs</i> augments the 12 core tracks with the not-yet-on-album-in-America songs from <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, along with the material from the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzXCvCNDRJQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sheila Take a Bow""</a> single. It's much better sequenced than <i>World</i>, arranged into four six-song suites on the original double LP: hard-headed rockers about being a socially maladjusted freak (plus ""Half a Person"", a soft-skinned lament about the same thing); warped pop songs about frustrated desire (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyJdiE0l23c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Panic""</a>, a rewrite of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"" target=""_blank"">T. Rex</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpA-7dNuobU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Metal Guru""</a> about the same thing); guitar showcases about being trapped inside one's own thoughts (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMY4W0l4peY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ask""</a>, a singalong about how hot sex could free you, yes you, from that trap); and a progressively more relaxed series of meditations about how even hot sex may still not make you want to live.</p>
<p>The Smiths broke up a few months after they recorded 1987's <i>Strangeways, Here We Come</i>, so it's tempting to hear it as a premonition of the band's doom, as opposed to the album with ""dead"" in its title, the album with ""murder"" in its title, or the album about murdered children. Even more than that, though, it's the Smiths' album about desperately trying not to repeat themselves: Their final single couldn't have had a cleverer title than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81cfD72BlQY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stop Me if You Think You've Heard This One Before""</a>. Morrissey's shifting into his now-familiar lyrical mode of deliberate self-parody (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBc_iyDvs4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Death at One's Elbow""</a> is effectively a camped-up burlesque of ""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""); Marr's doing his best to avoid the tingling Rickenbacker picking that was the closest thing he had to a default sound. That's generally a good idea here-- the autoharp he plays on the group's leavetaking, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAytConbtcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Won't Share You""</a>, is thrilling-- although the orchestral whomp on a few songs is overdoing it. And the fact that they're devoting so much energy to a song about being annoyed by the record business suggests that they might have been about to pass their sell-by date anyway.</p>
<p>To be fair, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08Zc17YQzdk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Paint a Vulgar Picture""</a> is both funny and painfully accurate about the fate of the Smiths' music after the Morrissey/Marr team split. <i>Rank</i>, released after Morrissey had launched his solo career, is useful as the Smiths' only full-on live album, and as a document of the brief era when Craig Gannon was their second guitarist (the <i>Queen Is Dead</i> tour, basically). It's also a contractually obligated piece of barrel-scraping, and the onstage Smiths were not what they'd once been-- they would play only six more complete gigs after the one recorded here. They're still pretty on-point, and it's fun to hear them swing through a verse of Elvis Presley's ""(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame"" as an introduction to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r57Lg7YTJmk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rusholme Ruffians""</a>, but it's uncharacteristically inessential.</p>
<p>And then there was nothing left to do but reissue! Repackage! Remaster! <i>Complete</i> follows the <i>Best</i>... sets, <i>Singles</i>, <i>The Very Best of the Smiths</i>, <i>The Sound of the Smiths,</i> and a few other cash-ins (even this set has an ultra-limited and exceedingly pricey deluxe version). The new mastering job, by Frank Arkwright working with Marr, actually is really good: loud but not bomb-level loud, clear, and airy. (<i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, in particular, is dramatically improved from its previous incarnations.) On the other hand, ""Complete"" is a profoundly inaccurate description of this set. Including both <i>The World Won't Listen</i> and <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> exceeds completeness; omitting the band's non-album tracks means the loss of some decent-to-terrific live B-sides, a bit of later-period filler, and the magnificent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRghlld8HU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jeane""</a>. Well, they never claimed not to be perverse.</p></div>"|16027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16027-the-smiths-complete/|8.3|Douglas Wolk

This box of newly remastered editions of their albums-- four studio records, three compilations of the singles and one-offs that were their greater strength, one live obligation-- would cement their reputation for brilliance and perversity, if it needed cementing.</p>
<p class=""p1"">From the Smiths' first single, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh2bonnjv70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hand in Glove""</a>, in the spring of 1983, to their breakup barely four years later, everything about them seemed like a considered and ingenious decision: their name's undertones of both facelesness and creativity, the way each of their records began with a different sort of guitar tone, the tinted monochrome photos on their sleeves, their proudly ashamed fascination with their home town of Manchester, the three-song EPs they released every few months as bulletins of their evolution, their shoplifting excursions through the used-singles bins of British popular music. (One of the small pleasures of working backward through pop history from the Smiths is stumbling across Sandie Shaw's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiYEpm_1lI8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven Knows I'm Missing Him Now""</a> or Reparata and the Delrons' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYXX_QeRj-o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shoes""</a>, for instance, and thinking <i>ohhh, now I get it</i>.)</p>
<p>The most obvious source of their genius was their singer, lyricist, and spokesman, Morrissey, a career eccentric who idolized Oscar Wilde and took a similar delight in pissing off anyone who had preconceived notions about masculinity. (Or, for that matter, men's singing voices, or what lyrics could and couldn't say, or whether or not it was a good idea to sing lines twice in a row if he was particularly proud of them.) His singing, then as now, was wildly affected and wildly virtuosic, bursting with growls and whoops and sly over-enunciations. And his lyrics and delivery were very, <i>very</i> deeply steeped in the history of gay culture, not least that in that they mimed something like being closeted: Morrissey's claims to celibacy, and early Smiths' lyrical revulsion about sex in general, are kind of hilarious in the light of, say, shirtless Joe Dallessandro appearing on the cover of their first album.</p>
<p>But the Smiths weren't Morrissey-plus-some-musicians, despite what he'd later try to suggest. They had a magnificent rhythm section in bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce, who were unflashy, tough, and supple. And they had guitarist and writer Johnny Marr, who was responsible for at least half of the Smiths' glory. It's hard to neatly describe what was so great about Marr, because he didn't have a particular gimmick or a signature sound; there are virtually no audible guitar solos on Smiths records. Instead, he worked up a different sound and technique for nearly every song in the band's discography--the <i>breadth</i> of his inventiveness is a good part of what's important about him.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that nobody else, before or since, has opened a significant rock album by hammering the bejesus out of the capoed, open-tuned chord that begins <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgNfTx9pGzA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Headmaster Ritual""</a>-- Marr has called his riff what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"" target=""_blank"">Joni Mitchell</a> ""would have done had she been an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"" target=""_blank"">MC5</a> fan."" There also aren't a lot of new wave classics with guitar lines inspired by Ghanaian highlife (and a rhythm section that's basically just playing ""You Can't Hurry Love""), but then there's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGnjrTkv1gs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This Charming Man""</a> to prove the rest of the world wrong. To have come up with the tone and riffs of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0TZZZcC9l4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""What Difference Does It Make?""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfkvPnjb9hs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clPhtitSpes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""London""</a> would be a coup for any guitarist; to have come up with all of them is astonishing.</p>
<p>Released in early 1984 after a couple of singles (and rapturous British press) had built up a buzz around the band, <i>The Smiths</i> is a terrific record, and also a slightly frustrating one: It's not quite the Smiths as we know them. (If they'd all perished in a terrible double-decker bus plunge immediately after its release, it'd certainly still be some kind of cult item, but we'd think of them as a much grimmer band, much more rooted in the smoky, post-punk worldview.) Starting a debut album with a slow, six-minute song that hints at working out memories of child abuse through painful sex (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxLFav1Z9EY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Reel Around the Fountain""</a>) was a particularly audacious move, undercut by overdubbed lounge-act keyboards played by Paul Carrack (the guy who'd sung Squeeze's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PmtS_qMdXg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tempted""</a>). Most of Morrissey's lyrics on <i>The Smiths</i>, in fact, allude to awful doings involving adults and children-- its closing track, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9DH0_b3F1c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Suffer Little Children""</a>, is explicitly about the Moors murders.</p>
<p>Musically, they weren't entirely on track yet: Mike Joyce's drums have that big, early-MTV boom, Morrissey's showing off his voice's capabilities even when he doesn't have much of a melody to apply them to, and the bizarre punk rock speed-up of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqelcupWcPg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Miserable Lie""</a> doesn't particularly suit them. But their aesthetic was already wholly formed-- the album's murk, sexual frankness, and situational ambiguity were a reaction against the British pop landscape of its time. The Smiths were already a singles band, too, and the album goes from ""quite good"" to ""remarkable"" halfway through, when Marr breaks into the delicious opening riff of ""This Charming Man"" and Morrissey finally gets laid.</p>
<p>Released nine months after <i>The Smiths</i>, <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, a thrown-together collection of radio sessions predating the studio album and tracks from singles, could've been a lesser companion piece to it. Instead, it's a masterpiece, a snapshot of a band moving too quickly to get a bead on. It's a much happier album than <i>The Smiths</i>-- the sequencing turns <i>Hatful</i>'s miscellany into something like a narrative about pickups and breakups and relationships, and ending with the combination of ""Reel Around the Fountain"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMQbzLrvwlE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want""</a> pulls off the neat trick of casting both of them as hopeful songs. The BBC session tracks have an offhanded spark and swing unmatched in the Smiths' catalog; the recent singles <i>Hatful</i> collects have a sense of delight that made the band whole. (""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"" may be the most lighthearted song ever written about suffocating despair.) How wonderful were they at that moment? Both <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U5HpeA_WSo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How Soon Is Now?""</a> and ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" had just seen release for the first time as the <i>B-sides</i> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMwUCmuND8Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""William, It Was Really Nothing""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Meat Is Murder</i>-- which followed <i>Hatful</i> by a mere three months-- is better recorded than <i>The Smiths</i>, although it's more a bunch of songs that didn't fit on singles than a coherent album. When it's good, it's great: ""The Headmaster Ritual"", especially, is full of chills-down-the-spine moments from Morrissey (the wordless, yodeling chorus that rhymes with ""I want to go home/ I don't want to stay,"" the second verse's thrilling deviations from the first). <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd-RPrpY1j0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""</a> is a legitimately uncanny slow one that builds up to a bullseye triple-entendre-- ""it was dark as I drove the point home""-- then recedes, surges back up, and fades away again. Still, Morrissey's often painfully out of tune on <i>Meat</i>'s lesser songs, and a lot of tracks here stretch out at considerable length. That works remarkably well for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDkDiC0BxGQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Barbarism Begins at Home""</a>, seven minutes of tense funk, but flops for the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpkPWwTJTSw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>'s tedious, eye-rollingly earnest animal-rights manifesto.</p>
<p>1986's <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> is the one studio album where the Smiths are operating at top capacity all the way through: they're aggressive, funny, rueful, tuneful, inventive, cryptic, tender, murderously furious at everything from Dear Old Blighty to their own miserablist selves, and let's underscore that ""funny"" again. Morrissey's refusing to take anything entirely seriously, particularly matters of life and death (you can practically hear him waggle his eyebrow as he tells Her Majesty ""you should hear me play <i>pi-anner</i>"")-- he's got his wrist taped to his forehead, but he's giggling about it. He's singing magnificently (those falsetto gasps in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYp2LGKOF_M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Boy with the Thorn in His Side""</a> are unbeatable), Marr's redefining ""guitar hero"" to have absolutely nothing to do with machismo (he effectively invents reggaebilly on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ownZDWNIRs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Frankly, Mr. Shankly""</a>), and the band's at ease with its capacity to speak for every sullen, curious, baffled teenager. Morrissey and Marr's production sounds remarkably undated, too-- the marvelous line in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqZdC6qXhLI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bigmouth Strikes Again""</a> about Joan of Arc's Walkman is now an anachronism twice over, but otherwise the album could pass for a really great product of 2011.</p>
<p>Even after <i>The Queen Is Dead</i>, the Smiths kept cranking out those three-song EPs, so two competing anthologies of their creative overflow appeared in early 1987. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> came out in the U.K. five weeks before <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> appeared in the U.S. They've got 12 songs in common, some in slightly different versions; of the five other songs on <i>World</i>, three are reprised from <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> and one from <i>Meat Is Murder</i>, and the last is an instrumental. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> starts very strongly-- its first half is singles and might-as-well-have-been-singles-- and then dissolves into a mess of slow, maudlin songs, interrupted by the chirruping of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giT_zL8YIcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Louder Than Bombs</i> augments the 12 core tracks with the not-yet-on-album-in-America songs from <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, along with the material from the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzXCvCNDRJQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sheila Take a Bow""</a> single. It's much better sequenced than <i>World</i>, arranged into four six-song suites on the original double LP: hard-headed rockers about being a socially maladjusted freak (plus ""Half a Person"", a soft-skinned lament about the same thing); warped pop songs about frustrated desire (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyJdiE0l23c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Panic""</a>, a rewrite of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"" target=""_blank"">T. Rex</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpA-7dNuobU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Metal Guru""</a> about the same thing); guitar showcases about being trapped inside one's own thoughts (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMY4W0l4peY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ask""</a>, a singalong about how hot sex could free you, yes you, from that trap); and a progressively more relaxed series of meditations about how even hot sex may still not make you want to live.</p>
<p>The Smiths broke up a few months after they recorded 1987's <i>Strangeways, Here We Come</i>, so it's tempting to hear it as a premonition of the band's doom, as opposed to the album with ""dead"" in its title, the album with ""murder"" in its title, or the album about murdered children.

Starting a debut album with a slow, six-minute song that hints at working out memories of child abuse through painful sex (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxLFav1Z9EY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Reel Around the Fountain""</a>) was a particularly audacious move, undercut by overdubbed lounge-act keyboards played by Paul Carrack (the guy who'd sung Squeeze's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PmtS_qMdXg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tempted""</a>). Most of Morrissey's lyrics on <i>The Smiths</i>, in fact, allude to awful doings involving adults and children-- its closing track, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9DH0_b3F1c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Suffer Little Children""</a>, is explicitly about the Moors murders.</p>
<p>Musically, they weren't entirely on track yet: Mike Joyce's drums have that big, early-MTV boom, Morrissey's showing off his voice's capabilities even when he doesn't have much of a melody to apply them to, and the bizarre punk rock speed-up of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqelcupWcPg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Miserable Lie""</a> doesn't particularly suit them. But their aesthetic was already wholly formed-- the album's murk, sexual frankness, and situational ambiguity were a reaction against the British pop landscape of its time. The Smiths were already a singles band, too, and the album goes from ""quite good"" to ""remarkable"" halfway through, when Marr breaks into the delicious opening riff of ""This Charming Man"" and Morrissey finally gets laid.</p>
<p>Released nine months after <i>The Smiths</i>, <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, a thrown-together collection of radio sessions predating the studio album and tracks from singles, could've been a lesser companion piece to it. Instead, it's a masterpiece, a snapshot of a band moving too quickly to get a bead on. It's a much happier album than <i>The Smiths</i>-- the sequencing turns <i>Hatful</i>'s miscellany into something like a narrative about pickups and breakups and relationships, and ending with the combination of ""Reel Around the Fountain"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMQbzLrvwlE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want""</a> pulls off the neat trick of casting both of them as hopeful songs. The BBC session tracks have an offhanded spark and swing unmatched in the Smiths' catalog; the recent singles <i>Hatful</i> collects have a sense of delight that made the band whole. (""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"" may be the most lighthearted song ever written about suffocating despair.) How wonderful were they at that moment? Both <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U5HpeA_WSo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How Soon Is Now?""</a> and ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" had just seen release for the first time as the <i>B-sides</i> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMwUCmuND8Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""William, It Was Really Nothing""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Meat Is Murder</i>-- which followed <i>Hatful</i> by a mere three months-- is better recorded than <i>The Smiths</i>, although it's more a bunch of songs that didn't fit on singles than a coherent album. When it's good, it's great: ""The Headmaster Ritual"", especially, is full of chills-down-the-spine moments from Morrissey (the wordless, yodeling chorus that rhymes with ""I want to go home/ I don't want to stay,"" the second verse's thrilling deviations from the first). <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd-RPrpY1j0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""</a> is a legitimately uncanny slow one that builds up to a bullseye triple-entendre-- ""it was dark as I drove the point home""-- then recedes, surges back up, and fades away again. Still, Morrissey's often painfully out of tune on <i>Meat</i>'s lesser songs, and a lot of tracks here stretch out at considerable length. That works remarkably well for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDkDiC0BxGQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Barbarism Begins at Home""</a>, seven minutes of tense funk, but flops for the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpkPWwTJTSw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>'s tedious, eye-rollingly earnest animal-rights manifesto.</p>
<p>1986's <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> is the one studio album where the Smiths are operating at top capacity all the way through: they're aggressive, funny, rueful, tuneful, inventive, cryptic, tender, murderously furious at everything from Dear Old Blighty to their own miserablist selves, and let's underscore that ""funny"" again. Morrissey's refusing to take anything entirely seriously, particularly matters of life and death (you can practically hear him waggle his eyebrow as he tells Her Majesty ""you should hear me play <i>pi-anner</i>"")-- he's got his wrist taped to his forehead, but he's giggling about it. He's singing magnificently (those falsetto gasps in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYp2LGKOF_M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Boy with the Thorn in His Side""</a> are unbeatable), Marr's redefining ""guitar hero"" to have absolutely nothing to do with machismo (he effectively invents reggaebilly on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ownZDWNIRs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Frankly, Mr. Shankly""</a>), and the band's at ease with its capacity to speak for every sullen, curious, baffled teenager. Morrissey and Marr's production sounds remarkably undated, too-- the marvelous line in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqZdC6qXhLI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bigmouth Strikes Again""</a> about Joan of Arc's Walkman is now an anachronism twice over, but otherwise the album could pass for a really great product of 2011.</p>
<p>Even after <i>The Queen Is Dead</i>, the Smiths kept cranking out those three-song EPs, so two competing anthologies of their creative overflow appeared in early 1987. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> came out in the U.K. five weeks before <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> appeared in the U.S. They've got 12 songs in common, some in slightly different versions; of the five other songs on <i>World</i>, three are reprised from <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> and one from <i>Meat Is Murder</i>, and the last is an instrumental. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> starts very strongly-- its first half is singles and might-as-well-have-been-singles-- and then dissolves into a mess of slow, maudlin songs, interrupted by the chirruping of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giT_zL8YIcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Louder Than Bombs</i> augments the 12 core tracks with the not-yet-on-album-in-America songs from <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, along with the material from the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzXCvCNDRJQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sheila Take a Bow""</a> single. It's much better sequenced than <i>World</i>, arranged into four six-song suites on the original double LP: hard-headed rockers about being a socially maladjusted freak (plus ""Half a Person"", a soft-skinned lament about the same thing); warped pop songs about frustrated desire (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyJdiE0l23c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Panic""</a>, a rewrite of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"" target=""_blank"">T. Rex</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpA-7dNuobU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Metal Guru""</a> about the same thing); guitar showcases about being trapped inside one's own thoughts (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMY4W0l4peY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ask""</a>, a singalong about how hot sex could free you, yes you, from that trap); and a progressively more relaxed series of meditations about how even hot sex may still not make you want to live.</p>
<p>The Smiths broke up a few months after they recorded 1987's <i>Strangeways, Here We Come</i>, so it's tempting to hear it as a premonition of the band's doom, as opposed to the album with ""dead"" in its title, the album with ""murder"" in its title, or the album about murdered children. Even more than that, though, it's the Smiths' album about desperately trying not to repeat themselves: Their final single couldn't have had a cleverer title than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81cfD72BlQY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stop Me if You Think You've Heard This One Before""</a>. Morrissey's shifting into his now-familiar lyrical mode of deliberate self-parody (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBc_iyDvs4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Death at One's Elbow""</a> is effectively a camped-up burlesque of ""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""); Marr's doing his best to avoid the tingling Rickenbacker picking that was the closest thing he had to a default sound. That's generally a good idea here-- the autoharp he plays on the group's leavetaking, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAytConbtcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Won't Share You""</a>, is thrilling-- although the orchestral whomp on a few songs is overdoing it. And the fact that they're devoting so much energy to a song about being annoyed by the record business suggests that they might have been about to pass their sell-by date anyway.</p>
<p>To be fair, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08Zc17YQzdk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Paint a Vulgar Picture""</a> is both funny and painfully accurate about the fate of the Smiths' music after the Morrissey/Marr team split. <i>Rank</i>, released after Morrissey had launched his solo career, is useful as the Smiths' only full-on live album, and as a document of the brief era when Craig Gannon was their second guitarist (the <i>Queen Is Dead</i> tour, basically). It's also a contractually obligated piece of barrel-scraping, and the onstage Smiths were not what they'd once been-- they would play only six more complete gigs after the one recorded here. They're still pretty on-point, and it's fun to hear them swing through a verse of Elvis Presley's ""(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame"" as an introduction to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r57Lg7YTJmk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rusholme Ruffians""</a>, but it's uncharacteristically inessential.</p>
<p>And then there was nothing left to do but reissue! Repackage! Remaster! <i>Complete</i> follows the <i>Best</i>... sets, <i>Singles</i>, <i>The Very Best of the Smiths</i>, <i>The Sound of the Smiths,</i> and a few other cash-ins (even this set has an ultra-limited and exceedingly pricey deluxe version). The new mastering job, by Frank Arkwright working with Marr, actually is really good: loud but not bomb-level loud, clear, and airy. (<i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, in particular, is dramatically improved from its previous incarnations.) On the other hand, ""Complete"" is a profoundly inaccurate description of this set. Including both <i>The World Won't Listen</i> and <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> exceeds completeness; omitting the band's non-album tracks means the loss of some decent-to-terrific live B-sides, a bit of later-period filler, and the magnificent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRghlld8HU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jeane""</a>.

This box of newly remastered editions of their albums-- four studio records, three compilations of the singles and one-offs that were their greater strength, one live obligation-- would cement their reputation for brilliance and perversity, if it needed cementing.</p>
<p class=""p1"">From the Smiths' first single, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh2bonnjv70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hand in Glove""</a>, in the spring of 1983, to their breakup barely four years later, everything about them seemed like a considered and ingenious decision: their name's undertones of both facelesness and creativity, the way each of their records began with a different sort of guitar tone, the tinted monochrome photos on their sleeves, their proudly ashamed fascination with their home town of Manchester, the three-song EPs they released every few months as bulletins of their evolution, their shoplifting excursions through the used-singles bins of British popular music. (One of the small pleasures of working backward through pop history from the Smiths is stumbling across Sandie Shaw's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiYEpm_1lI8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven Knows I'm Missing Him Now""</a> or Reparata and the Delrons' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYXX_QeRj-o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shoes""</a>, for instance, and thinking <i>ohhh, now I get it</i>.)</p>
<p>The most obvious source of their genius was their singer, lyricist, and spokesman, Morrissey, a career eccentric who idolized Oscar Wilde and took a similar delight in pissing off anyone who had preconceived notions about masculinity. (Or, for that matter, men's singing voices, or what lyrics could and couldn't say, or whether or not it was a good idea to sing lines twice in a row if he was particularly proud of them.) His singing, then as now, was wildly affected and wildly virtuosic, bursting with growls and whoops and sly over-enunciations. And his lyrics and delivery were very, <i>very</i> deeply steeped in the history of gay culture, not least that in that they mimed something like being closeted: Morrissey's claims to celibacy, and early Smiths' lyrical revulsion about sex in general, are kind of hilarious in the light of, say, shirtless Joe Dallessandro appearing on the cover of their first album.</p>
<p>But the Smiths weren't Morrissey-plus-some-musicians, despite what he'd later try to suggest. They had a magnificent rhythm section in bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce, who were unflashy, tough, and supple. And they had guitarist and writer Johnny Marr, who was responsible for at least half of the Smiths' glory. It's hard to neatly describe what was so great about Marr, because he didn't have a particular gimmick or a signature sound; there are virtually no audible guitar solos on Smiths records. Instead, he worked up a different sound and technique for nearly every song in the band's discography--the <i>breadth</i> of his inventiveness is a good part of what's important about him.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that nobody else, before or since, has opened a significant rock album by hammering the bejesus out of the capoed, open-tuned chord that begins <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgNfTx9pGzA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Headmaster Ritual""</a>-- Marr has called his riff what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"" target=""_blank"">Joni Mitchell</a> ""would have done had she been an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"" target=""_blank"">MC5</a> fan."" There also aren't a lot of new wave classics with guitar lines inspired by Ghanaian highlife (and a rhythm section that's basically just playing ""You Can't Hurry Love""), but then there's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGnjrTkv1gs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This Charming Man""</a> to prove the rest of the world wrong. To have come up with the tone and riffs of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0TZZZcC9l4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""What Difference Does It Make?""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfkvPnjb9hs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clPhtitSpes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""London""</a> would be a coup for any guitarist; to have come up with all of them is astonishing.</p>

This box of newly remastered editions of their albums-- four studio records, three compilations of the singles and one-offs that were their greater strength, one live obligation-- would cement their reputation for brilliance and perversity, if it needed cementing.</p>
<p class=""p1"">From the Smiths' first single, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh2bonnjv70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hand in Glove""</a>, in the spring of 1983, to their breakup barely four years later, everything about them seemed like a considered and ingenious decision: their name's undertones of both facelesness and creativity, the way each of their records began with a different sort of guitar tone, the tinted monochrome photos on their sleeves, their proudly ashamed fascination with their home town of Manchester, the three-song EPs they released every few months as bulletins of their evolution, their shoplifting excursions through the used-singles bins of British popular music. (One of the small pleasures of working backward through pop history from the Smiths is stumbling across Sandie Shaw's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiYEpm_1lI8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven Knows I'm Missing Him Now""</a> or Reparata and the Delrons' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYXX_QeRj-o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shoes""</a>, for instance, and thinking <i>ohhh, now I get it</i>.)</p>
<p>The most obvious source of their genius was their singer, lyricist, and spokesman, Morrissey, a career eccentric who idolized Oscar Wilde and took a similar delight in pissing off anyone who had preconceived notions about masculinity. (Or, for that matter, men's singing voices, or what lyrics could and couldn't say, or whether or not it was a good idea to sing lines twice in a row if he was particularly proud of them.) His singing, then as now, was wildly affected and wildly virtuosic, bursting with growls and whoops and sly over-enunciations. And his lyrics and delivery were very, <i>very</i> deeply steeped in the history of gay culture, not least that in that they mimed something like being closeted: Morrissey's claims to celibacy, and early Smiths' lyrical revulsion about sex in general, are kind of hilarious in the light of, say, shirtless Joe Dallessandro appearing on the cover of their first album.</p>
<p>But the Smiths weren't Morrissey-plus-some-musicians, despite what he'd later try to suggest. They had a magnificent rhythm section in bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce, who were unflashy, tough, and supple. And they had guitarist and writer Johnny Marr, who was responsible for at least half of the Smiths' glory. It's hard to neatly describe what was so great about Marr, because he didn't have a particular gimmick or a signature sound; there are virtually no audible guitar solos on Smiths records. Instead, he worked up a different sound and technique for nearly every song in the band's discography--the <i>breadth</i> of his inventiveness is a good part of what's important about him.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that nobody else, before or since, has opened a significant rock album by hammering the bejesus out of the capoed, open-tuned chord that begins <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgNfTx9pGzA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Headmaster Ritual""</a>-- Marr has called his riff what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"" target=""_blank"">Joni Mitchell</a> ""would have done had she been an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"" target=""_blank"">MC5</a> fan."" There also aren't a lot of new wave classics with guitar lines inspired by Ghanaian highlife (and a rhythm section that's basically just playing ""You Can't Hurry Love""), but then there's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGnjrTkv1gs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This Charming Man""</a> to prove the rest of the world wrong. To have come up with the tone and riffs of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0TZZZcC9l4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""What Difference Does It Make?""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfkvPnjb9hs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clPhtitSpes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""London""</a> would be a coup for any guitarist; to have come up with all of them is astonishing.</p>
<p>Released in early 1984 after a couple of singles (and rapturous British press) had built up a buzz around the band, <i>The Smiths</i> is a terrific record, and also a slightly frustrating one: It's not quite the Smiths as we know them. (If they'd all perished in a terrible double-decker bus plunge immediately after its release, it'd certainly still be some kind of cult item, but we'd think of them as a much grimmer band, much more rooted in the smoky, post-punk worldview.) Starting a debut album with a slow, six-minute song that hints at working out memories of child abuse through painful sex (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxLFav1Z9EY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Reel Around the Fountain""</a>) was a particularly audacious move, undercut by overdubbed lounge-act keyboards played by Paul Carrack (the guy who'd sung Squeeze's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PmtS_qMdXg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tempted""</a>). Most of Morrissey's lyrics on <i>The Smiths</i>, in fact, allude to awful doings involving adults and children-- its closing track, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9DH0_b3F1c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Suffer Little Children""</a>, is explicitly about the Moors murders.</p>
<p>Musically, they weren't entirely on track yet: Mike Joyce's drums have that big, early-MTV boom, Morrissey's showing off his voice's capabilities even when he doesn't have much of a melody to apply them to, and the bizarre punk rock speed-up of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqelcupWcPg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Miserable Lie""</a> doesn't particularly suit them. But their aesthetic was already wholly formed-- the album's murk, sexual frankness, and situational ambiguity were a reaction against the British pop landscape of its time. The Smiths were already a singles band, too, and the album goes from ""quite good"" to ""remarkable"" halfway through, when Marr breaks into the delicious opening riff of ""This Charming Man"" and Morrissey finally gets laid.</p>
<p>Released nine months after <i>The Smiths</i>, <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, a thrown-together collection of radio sessions predating the studio album and tracks from singles, could've been a lesser companion piece to it. Instead, it's a masterpiece, a snapshot of a band moving too quickly to get a bead on. It's a much happier album than <i>The Smiths</i>-- the sequencing turns <i>Hatful</i>'s miscellany into something like a narrative about pickups and breakups and relationships, and ending with the combination of ""Reel Around the Fountain"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMQbzLrvwlE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want""</a> pulls off the neat trick of casting both of them as hopeful songs. The BBC session tracks have an offhanded spark and swing unmatched in the Smiths' catalog; the recent singles <i>Hatful</i> collects have a sense of delight that made the band whole. (""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"" may be the most lighthearted song ever written about suffocating despair.) How wonderful were they at that moment? Both <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U5HpeA_WSo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How Soon Is Now?""</a> and ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" had just seen release for the first time as the <i>B-sides</i> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMwUCmuND8Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""William, It Was Really Nothing""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Meat Is Murder</i>-- which followed <i>Hatful</i> by a mere three months-- is better recorded than <i>The Smiths</i>, although it's more a bunch of songs that didn't fit on singles than a coherent album. When it's good, it's great: ""The Headmaster Ritual"", especially, is full of chills-down-the-spine moments from Morrissey (the wordless, yodeling chorus that rhymes with ""I want to go home/ I don't want to stay,"" the second verse's thrilling deviations from the first). <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd-RPrpY1j0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""</a> is a legitimately uncanny slow one that builds up to a bullseye triple-entendre-- ""it was dark as I drove the point home""-- then recedes, surges back up, and fades away again. Still, Morrissey's often painfully out of tune on <i>Meat</i>'s lesser songs, and a lot of tracks here stretch out at considerable length. That works remarkably well for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDkDiC0BxGQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Barbarism Begins at Home""</a>, seven minutes of tense funk, but flops for the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpkPWwTJTSw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>'s tedious, eye-rollingly earnest animal-rights manifesto.</p>
<p>1986's <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> is the one studio album where the Smiths are operating at top capacity all the way through: they're aggressive, funny, rueful, tuneful, inventive, cryptic, tender, murderously furious at everything from Dear Old Blighty to their own miserablist selves, and let's underscore that ""funny"" again. Morrissey's refusing to take anything entirely seriously, particularly matters of life and death (you can practically hear him waggle his eyebrow as he tells Her Majesty ""you should hear me play <i>pi-anner</i>"")-- he's got his wrist taped to his forehead, but he's giggling about it. He's singing magnificently (those falsetto gasps in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYp2LGKOF_M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Boy with the Thorn in His Side""</a> are unbeatable), Marr's redefining ""guitar hero"" to have absolutely nothing to do with machismo (he effectively invents reggaebilly on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ownZDWNIRs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Frankly, Mr. Shankly""</a>), and the band's at ease with its capacity to speak for every sullen, curious, baffled teenager. Morrissey and Marr's production sounds remarkably undated, too-- the marvelous line in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqZdC6qXhLI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bigmouth Strikes Again""</a> about Joan of Arc's Walkman is now an anachronism twice over, but otherwise the album could pass for a really great product of 2011.</p>
<p>Even after <i>The Queen Is Dead</i>, the Smiths kept cranking out those three-song EPs, so two competing anthologies of their creative overflow appeared in early 1987. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> came out in the U.K. five weeks before <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> appeared in the U.S. They've got 12 songs in common, some in slightly different versions; of the five other songs on <i>World</i>, three are reprised from <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> and one from <i>Meat Is Murder</i>, and the last is an instrumental. <i>The World Won't Listen</i> starts very strongly-- its first half is singles and might-as-well-have-been-singles-- and then dissolves into a mess of slow, maudlin songs, interrupted by the chirruping of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giT_zL8YIcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Louder Than Bombs</i> augments the 12 core tracks with the not-yet-on-album-in-America songs from <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, along with the material from the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzXCvCNDRJQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sheila Take a Bow""</a> single. It's much better sequenced than <i>World</i>, arranged into four six-song suites on the original double LP: hard-headed rockers about being a socially maladjusted freak (plus ""Half a Person"", a soft-skinned lament about the same thing); warped pop songs about frustrated desire (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyJdiE0l23c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Panic""</a>, a rewrite of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4162-t-rex/"" target=""_blank"">T. Rex</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpA-7dNuobU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Metal Guru""</a> about the same thing); guitar showcases about being trapped inside one's own thoughts (plus <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMY4W0l4peY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ask""</a>, a singalong about how hot sex could free you, yes you, from that trap); and a progressively more relaxed series of meditations about how even hot sex may still not make you want to live.</p>
<p>The Smiths broke up a few months after they recorded 1987's <i>Strangeways, Here We Come</i>, so it's tempting to hear it as a premonition of the band's doom, as opposed to the album with ""dead"" in its title, the album with ""murder"" in its title, or the album about murdered children. Even more than that, though, it's the Smiths' album about desperately trying not to repeat themselves: Their final single couldn't have had a cleverer title than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81cfD72BlQY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stop Me if You Think You've Heard This One Before""</a>. Morrissey's shifting into his now-familiar lyrical mode of deliberate self-parody (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBc_iyDvs4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Death at One's Elbow""</a> is effectively a camped-up burlesque of ""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore""); Marr's doing his best to avoid the tingling Rickenbacker picking that was the closest thing he had to a default sound. That's generally a good idea here-- the autoharp he plays on the group's leavetaking, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAytConbtcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Won't Share You""</a>, is thrilling-- although the orchestral whomp on a few songs is overdoing it. And the fact that they're devoting so much energy to a song about being annoyed by the record business suggests that they might have been about to pass their sell-by date anyway.</p>
<p>To be fair, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08Zc17YQzdk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Paint a Vulgar Picture""</a> is both funny and painfully accurate about the fate of the Smiths' music after the Morrissey/Marr team split. <i>Rank</i>, released after Morrissey had launched his solo career, is useful as the Smiths' only full-on live album, and as a document of the brief era when Craig Gannon was their second guitarist (the <i>Queen Is Dead</i> tour, basically). It's also a contractually obligated piece of barrel-scraping, and the onstage Smiths were not what they'd once been-- they would play only six more complete gigs after the one recorded here. They're still pretty on-point, and it's fun to hear them swing through a verse of Elvis Presley's ""(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame"" as an introduction to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r57Lg7YTJmk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rusholme Ruffians""</a>, but it's uncharacteristically inessential.</p>
<p>And then there was nothing left to do but reissue! Repackage! Remaster! <i>Complete</i> follows the <i>Best</i>... sets, <i>Singles</i>, <i>The Very Best of the Smiths</i>, <i>The Sound of the Smiths,</i> and a few other cash-ins (even this set has an ultra-limited and exceedingly pricey deluxe version). The new mastering job, by Frank Arkwright working with Marr, actually is really good: loud but not bomb-level loud, clear, and airy. (<i>Hatful of Hollow</i>, in particular, is dramatically improved from its previous incarnations.) On the other hand, ""Complete"" is a profoundly inaccurate description of this set. Including both <i>The World Won't Listen</i> and <i>Louder Than Bombs</i> exceeds completeness; omitting the band's non-album tracks means the loss of some decent-to-terrific live B-sides, a bit of later-period filler, and the magnificent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRghlld8HU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jeane""</a>. Well, they never claimed not to be perverse.</p></div>"|16027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16027-the-smiths-complete/|9.4|Douglas Wolk

He lags slightly behind the flickering electronic phrases of collaborator Kieren Hebden, better known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>, like he's forgotten the clip of the tune that opened their 2007 album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10009-tongues/"" target=""_blank"">Tongues</a></i>. It would be hard to blame Reid, after all; at this point, just 10 months before he died of throat cancer last year, the 65-year-old was an hour deep into a June 2009 performance with Reid and fierce Swedish saxophonist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1834-mats-gustafsson/"" target=""_blank"">Mats Gustafsson</a> in London's Queen Elizabeth Hall. They'd been busy, too. Earlier, the trio had taken four of five numbers well past the 10-minute mark. The only relatively brief piece had been ""Lyman Palace"", for which Gustafsson finally stepped onto the stage and-- with his deep, broad bellows-- injected a ferocity that bordered on frightening. You'd be tired, too.</p>
<p>But Reid's story has never really been a tale of quitting. A teenager drummer in New York, he famously gigged with James Brown and the Vandellas before serving a two-year prison sentence for his Vietnam evasion. He returned to the kit upon release, eventually forming his own group (with at least one really great album to their name) and working with legends spread across several different forms-- R&amp;B legend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22032-dionne-warwick/"" target=""_blank"">Dionne Warwick</a>, astral jazz traveler <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3504-sun-ra/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Ra</a> and African icon, and iconoclast <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/"" target=""_blank"">Fela Kuti</a>. In 1986, he even added a touch of percussion to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"" target=""_blank"">Miles Davis</a>' <i>Tutu</i>. But for a player who was drumming with the stars by the time he was 16, much of the success and steady work that might've seemed logical for Reid mostly proved elusive. Through the 1990s and into the first half of the last decade, his output could be described, at best, as a trickle. But that all changed when, as legend has it, Hebden watched Gustafsson perform at the Oslo Jazz Festival in 2004. He decided he needed a drummer and, more importantly, a collaborative partner. After Hebden, Reid's trickle became something of a deluge. The two first played together in 2005, and Hebden played on parts of Reid's fantastic record for Soul Jazz that year, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6931-spirit-walk/"" target=""_blank"">Spirit Walk</a></i>. They summarily released two albums, <i>The Exchange Sessions Vols. 1</i> and <i>2</i>, recorded in a single day at London's Exchange Mastering Studios.</p>
<p>Hebden's albums as Four Tet had often seemed about a sort of robotic composure, pairing an elegant sense of melody to a composer's eye for development; these collaborations with Reid, though, showed a young musician interested in letting loose those fetters, in playing with more interest in the perfect personal musical moment than pristine dance-floor momentum. Reid and Hebden continued to flirt with flashes of brilliance on 2007's <i>Tongues</i> and 2008's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12440-nyc/"" target=""_blank"">NYC</a></i>, but they never seemed to cash in on their true potential. Sometimes, it seemed, Hebden couldn't push away from his compulsion to build big songs, no matter how hard Reid banged the drums at his back.</p>
<p>On <i>South Bank</i>-- the most vital and essential document of Reid and Hebden's five-year partnership-- it feels clear that, at least onstage, they were finally able to go the distance. The invocation ""Morning Prayer"" opens slowly, circling in space with a meditative calm. For 17 minutes, the pair traces lines around the other's rhythm, Hebden's electronics and keys shaping a cradle for Reid's busy tom-and-cymbal patter, and vice versa. Back in 2006, on <i>Volume 1</i>, ""Morning Prayer"" felt slight but suggestive, as if Reid and Hebden were only testing the water; here, they're living in it. In London that night, Gustafsson was so mesmerized by the pair's chemistry that he forgot to join until the piece was done.</p>
<p>When he finally enters, though, he fits readily, adding a strange new mix of aggression and soul to ""Lyman Place"". He sounds like an air-raid siren but quotes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/"" target=""_blank"">Coltrane</a>; Reid and Hebden respond in kind, their own treatment reinvigorated by a stranger who didn't know its original bounds. ""People Be Happy"", originally heard on 2007's <i>Tongues</i>, capitalizes on that openness, too, with the trio pushing the tune's distinctive fragment of a melody into a strange, elliptical sphere. Gustafsson and Reid wind strands of sound through one another, while Hebden sits back, building a back-and-forth bed of sound upon which they both move. As accomplished with fierce, focused marches (""Untitled"") as they are with open-ended textural explorations (""25th Street""), this one-time-only trio understood its own extremes-- and how to navigate breathlessly, relentlessly, and brazenly between them.</p>
<p>As ""The Sun Never Sets"" progresses, Reid's fatigue turns out to be only a passing notion. Just three minutes in, he's forcing the rest of the squad to twist one of the most memorable melodies of his work with Hebden into unrecognizable patterns. He jumps from cymbals to kick drum, from toms to cymbals. Gustafsson broods, and Hebden wraps the theme in a fuselage of noise. They distend what seems like the end, stretching the coda into a slow exhalation. But as everyone else starts to fade, Reid remains, pounding his drums a little harder than you might expect after these nearly 90 bustling minutes, like he wants to keep going.</p></div>"|16063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16063-live-at-the-south-bank/|8.0|Grayson Currin

In 2007 he released a record of bullish roots rock with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5525-tulsa/"">Tulsa</a> titled <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10867-i-was-submerged/"">I Was Submerged</a></i>, only for that band to disintegrate before their potential was fully realized. Tanton has subsequently worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"">Marissa Nadler</a> and Baltimore art punks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28880-lower-dens/"">Lower Dens</a>, establishing himself as a guitarist with both bands. His presence in Lower Dens continues, but he has also found time to record <i>Freeclouds</i>, an all-over-the-map solo effort that tugs strongly on the aura of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYj2HVyMuU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud""</a> for inspiration. Tanton is more rooted in earthly matters than Bowie, lending much of this record an agrarian feel that meshes with surges of serrated energy, perfectly intersecting his work with Nadler and Lower Dens.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Part of Tanton's appeal to other players surely comes from his studio skills. <i>Freeclouds</i> was mostly recorded at home, but you'd never know it. Tracks like ""Murderous Joy"" and ""Saturday"" may bear tinny drum sounds, but it sounds like an aesthetic choice rather than one forced upon him. Like a lot of people in his position, Tanton's biggest strength is as a composer and arranger rather than a lyricist. There's a mid-section on ""Murderous Joy"" where all the clutter drops away for a few seconds and an affected guitar sound sags and swoons, digging out a feeling of loss that reaches somewhere far more meaningful than his strained <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a>-lite vocals.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But this is an album of ever-shifting modes, where Tanton's singing remain constantly fluid, occasionally spreading out toward a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Chris Martin</a>-style rush (""Landlines"") and sometimes wallowing in a lower registry lament reminiscent of Bradford Cox in his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5633-atlas-sound/"">Atlas Sound</a> guise (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12684-fake-pretend-ft-marissa-nadler/"">""Fake Pretend""</a>). His desire to process his voice on multiple songs perhaps suggests he hasn't found his feet as a singer yet, although it's more likely to tie into his need to constantly dabble with the overall sound. The most successful experiments are prized out of the glitchy electronics Tanton likes to work with-- ""Gauze of Song"" bears a fizzy backing that sounds like old analog circuitry burning out and going haywire, while ""Pasture Sound"" fixes bright acoustic plucking to a bed of rippling beats that are all buried in a warm coat of fuzz two-thirds of the way through.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There's a sense of hippy idealism that pervades throughout <i>Freeclouds</i>, edging toward the kind of wide-eyed sentiment <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"">John Lennon</a> practiced at his least cynical. That feel is best manifested in Tanton's Lennon-like cover of ""Saturday"" by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3902-sparklehorse/"">Sparklehorse</a>, which sits at the center of this record and unfolds with an ease that the stilted material elsewhere never quite reaches. It's not clear what Tanton wanted this album to be, especially when he takes wild diversions into the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Mary Chain</a>-isms of ""Horrorscope"" and the pitch-bent shoegazer-y backing of ""Land Lines"". It's a loose collection of whims and desires, unrolled over vast expanses of terrain that Tanton could survey for a while to see how they fit. That makes sense for someone who has made a career of gifting his talents to a diverse collection of other artists, but further solo ventures could use some big picture thinking to add the edge of clarity <i>Freeclouds</i> is lacking.</p>

Both masters erecting sickly, muted environments, their dub(step) was arty and sprawling enough-- both made use of Middle Eastern samples-- to lure an American rock-kid into England's dance culture. The two artists have been quiet lately: Pinch retreated into dance-oriented 12""s in addition to curating his Tectonic imprint, while Shackleton moved to Berlin and released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14947-fabric-55/"" target=""_blank"">some minimal techno</a> for a minimal-techno label (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15056-superlongevity-5/"" target=""_blank"">an excellent one</a>). Announced and released last week by the astute Honest Jon's label, <i>Pinch &amp; Shackleton</i> is a welcome return to each artist's peculiar roots.</p>
<p>Despite obvious common ground, Shackleton and Pinch achieve their thick headspaces in different ways-- Shackleton the austere, death-obsessed perfectionist and Pinch the reggae-savvy producer unafraid to let a mediocre rapper sully his tracks. Rather than a summing of styles, <i>Pinch &amp; Shackleton</i> plays as a vision of what bass music was a half-decade ago, two producers' onetime vision of progress. It benefits massively from a lack of artists interested in these sounds: In 2011 bass music is brighter, or deeper, or more aggressive.</p>
<p><i>P&amp;S</i> is not very bright or deep or aggressive; its nine tracks often file forward with quiet confidence but without explicit purpose. The duo stresses clarity: Synths float well above Shackleton's exacting percussion (its complexity dialed back here), sub-bass rumble, and vocal samples applied judiciously. When the music floats hazily by, such as during the opening minutes of ""Levitation"", it is an intentional, manicured float. Four minutes into ""Cracks in the Pleasuredome"" the duo dials up shards of a Middle Eastern vocal cadence, and I'm reminded of a type of mystical-industrial fantasies Pinch and Shackleton are capable of conjuring. ""Selfish Greedy Life"" chatters ominously, little demons competing for attention with steam-vent bursts and saucer-like patches. ""Monks on the Rum"" is the duo's palette stretched on putty, diffuse and manipulated but no less composed.</p>
<p>This is not the foggy, soft-focus paranoia of an artist like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>, whose work has informed so much underground electronic composition; Pinch and Shackleton don't want to suggest darkness; they want to create it. They do so with familiar tones and structures, but ones that remain effective: see, after three minutes of whispering synths and whinnying flutes, if the bass drop of ""Burning Blood"" doesn't make you <i>smell</i> something. In 2011, Pinch and Shackleton are a sensory experience; their waters are crystal clear, but sometimes you don't want to know what's at the bottom of the lake. Let's be excited they're showing us again.</p></div>"|16052.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16052-pinch-shackleton/|7.3|Andrew Gaerig

(Jessica Zambri and Hooray frontman <span>Noel Heroux</span> are married.) The two bands subsequently traded remixes, resulting in the cleanly anthemic <a href=""http://www.no-conclusion.com/2011/11/06/zambri-heather-hooray-for-earth-remix/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heather"" </a>and peculiarly incoherent <a href=""http://weirdmagic.biz/2010/10/hooray-for-earth-comfortable-comparable-zambri-remix/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Comfortable, Comparable""</a>. The latter was a technological massacre: almost a cautionary fable about what it will sound like if our samplers rise up against us. It didn't raise high expectations for how the Zambri sisters-- talented performers, by most reports-- would fare as composers. Their debut EP, <i><a href=""http://stereogum.com/876372/stream-zambri-glossolalia/mp3s/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Glossolalia</a></i>, is better, but it's still a distressing piece of work overall, stranded somewhere confusingly between experimental chaos and idiomatic pop.</p>
<p>A sliver of sweet-spot exists between those poles-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"">the Knife</a> basically live on it. But it's hard to hit the head of a pin with a bazooka. Zambri's open warfare against any preconceptions we might have about their experimental bona fides makes <i>Glossolalia</i><span style=""color: #222222;""> a chore to listen to. As means to an unclear end, it stages clashes between brutishly misfiring percussion, keyboard lines so aimlessly broken they're barely melodies, and electronically treated vocal textures, all of which cooperate only haphazardly. Drifting somewhere in the morass are the spooky refrains that inevitably get called pop hooks. The seeds of sound ideas have trouble sprouting amid all the eccentricity of style, and the result is like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"">Zola Jesus</a> with a more prosaic vocal presence but plenty of funny noises to make up for it.</span></p>
<p>The actively unpleasant ""On Call"" is a strange choice for an opener, as its most substantial content is an erratic percussion track that literally sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard. It's a loud machine made of random parts that doesn't actually do anything besides grind down its own ill-fitted gears. The inoffensive but plodding ""Heather"" is more structurally lucid but harmonically blurry, which makes it sound like a competent but imperfect mash-up-- just a hair off. The clarion exception is ""To Keep Back"", where the drum, keyboard, and bass tracks were clearly designed to go together, rather than seeming like a one-legged, seven-armed Frankenstein. It also helps that the anesthesia from the first two songs wears off, and the sisters start to really sing, with humanizing swing and soul, unfettered by robotic caveman and barnyard noises. It's not very ""challenging,"" but it's a good, dark electro-pop song by any measure, and sounds fucking epic in the context of this slender, weedy harvest. They're really good at singing! The pains they take to undermine that talent are baffling.</p>
<p>While it doesn't reach the modest heights of ""To Keep Back"", the second half of the EP is much more sensible than the first. The bouncy ""News"" boasts interesting bass and melody bits made from filtered vocals, and a more palatable mystic-pop callback of the trainwreck opener probably should have just been the official version. Zambri are still promising-- we may just be hearing the growing pains of a new band figuring out what it's good at. This one seems unaware that its pop instincts are much sharper than its experimental ones. You can tell what they were going for from the title of the EP, which means speaking in tongues. But that has a double connotation of gibberish <i>and</i> inspiration. We get too much of the former and too little of the latter here.</p></div>"|16058.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16058-glossolalia/|4.2|Brian Howe

<p>Hart, Doss, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3025-neutral-milk-hotel/"" target=""_blank"">Neutral Milk Hotel</a>'s Jeff Mangum, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/117-the-apples-in-stereo/"" target=""_blank"">Apples in Stereo</a> frontman (and <i>Dusk</i> producer) Robert Schneider grew up filling up Tascams with four-track nonsense in and around their Ruston, Louisiana, home, exploring genres headlong and forging bands at will.

Veering wildly between sturdy sunshine-pop and sloppy ambient noise, calamitous hooks and conversations with the godhead, the Olivias' records are driven by an impossibly expansive vision.

<p>In hindsight, the decidedly strange <i>Dusk at Cubist Castle</i> is the straight of the pair. Stately, sumptuous, and slightly otherworldly, <i>Dusk</i> is brimming with immaculate hooks and queries bound for the cosmos. <i>Dusk</i>'s first half is certainly the most immediate stretch of songcraft OTC laid to tape, big, sinewy hooks brought to life in brilliant color. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PStW0hGocY0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Opera House""</a> is a blur of fuzz guitar and harmonica, leading off with the funny notion of going to the movies just to watch the actors move their mouths. The surreality of it all is certainly worth a mention: Catchy as they are, these songs are riddled with potholes, with weird left turns, with hooks that seem to bubble out of nowhere before receding into themselves. The one-two of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUjd6DHAutU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jumping Fences""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLfa2YCJZMM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Define a Transparent Dream""</a>, joined at the hip by a gloriously gooey transition, are a triumph of taut pop proficiency. Littered as they are with references to the atmosphere breathing with life and a lonely psychonaut too caught up inside his head for speech, though, these tunes seek to transcend both consensus reality and the constraints of the straight-outta-1966 vibe of so many of their E6 contemporaries. Though clearly besotted with the freewheeling pop of the late-1960s-- Bill Doss' eternally impressive sideburns are testament enough to that-- they cut their songs with too many intersecting ideas to ever feel too fixed in one particular place for very long.</p>
<p><i>Black Foliage</i>'s pop moments are gnarlier, more restless, their hooks arriving at odd angles; all this they weave through a tapestry of orchestral bleats and backward-running loops, five seconds of scuzz enveloping four minutes of sheer bliss. Rather than relegate its sonic tinkering to its second act, <i>Black Foliage</i> dunks OTC's experimental tendencies directly into their popcraft. It's a magisterial vision, a whole world rendered in sound; it is also, at first, rather overwhelming, its constantly shifting sonics more than a little tough to settle into from moment to moment. Give yourself over to it, though, and <i>Black Foliage</i> is among the most satisfying psychedelic albums of any decade, a carefully controlled caterwauling chaos pushing along Hart and Doss' unanswerable questions and anthropomorphisms. You're aware of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Bardo</a>, yeah? <i>Black Foliage</i> seems intimately acquainted with the thing, touting as it does both individuality (""don't hide away from your intricacies"") and something more inexplicable; ""I have been floated to this thought this hour,"" Hart, Schneider, and eventually Mangum sing, ""on a series of events I cannot explain."" <i>Black Foliage</i> is not some work of accidental genius, some acid-fueled inspiration point captured as it's being created; every wriggly second reveals painstaking craft, every hint of tape hiss seems to whisper of another good idea buried somewhere in the static. Still, it's pretty clear that the relationship these guys had with non-musical psychedelia was, at the time, fairly recent, and <i>Black Foliage</i> seems to carry hints of something a little beyond this world.</p>
<p>The large-scale sonic experiments-- swaths of silence, planes flying overhead, of alarm clocks and ambient drift-- that engulf much of the second half of both of these LPs are, even for longtime E6 devotees, something of a hurdle. Even in the midst of the woollier <i>Black Foliage</i> songs, their contrast with the pop-minded stuff that precedes them is so great, their tunefulness next to nil, the results are certainly self-indulgent and, for many, kinda boring; I had a friend in college who'd burned himself <i>Cubist Castle</i> with most of the eighth (and longest) ""Green Typewriters"" lobbed off so he wouldn't have to keep skipping it. Again, though, this seems to be the band's attempt at wrestling the psychedelic experience-- the initial flash, followed by the inward gaze-- into sound. They're not working through McKenna or the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> or anything here, but they bring the trip through all its stages; at the end, you're summarily exhausted and full of questions, your synapses having wriggled themselves awake one by one over the preceding quarter-hour. And, frankly, for guys who can bang out pop songs like they could, their experimental tendencies are very nearly as impressive; their noise is lush, their silence speaks volumes, and best of all, they're in on the joke. At the end of the extra-long ""Green Typewriters"", Hart jumps into another with a question-as-punchline: ""how much longer can I wait?""</p>
<p>Though <i>Cubist Castle</i> appears untouched, <i>Black Foliage</i> has been remastered from the original tapes; the bass is a bit louder, the vocals a little fuller, and there's ever-so-slightly more clarity in certain patches. But the whirr of some dust-addled four-track still sits underneath these songs, which is as it should be. Either set comes with a download card good for hours upon hours of outtakes, alternates, radio sessions, and the like, much of it unreleased, out-of-print, or otherwise unheard. Taken together, the extra stuff's longer than the albums themselves; hey, nobody ever accused these guys of being especially judicious editors. I'm still working my way through the second disc of the <i>Smile</i> box myself, so all this seemed a little much at first, especially when they launch into their own stoned <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYbSTZYNoUw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Do You Like Worms""</a> medley. But, listening to the extras, you realize just how much they were capable of, just how powerful their overarching vision for these records really was; four minutes from the very good ""The Sky Is a Harpsichord Canvas"" were excised from <i>Black Foliage</i> due to time constraints, and while it's fun to hear the expanded song itself in the spirit of excavation, knowing what didn't make the cut makes the remaining bits seem that much stronger. Flecks of the recurring instrumental themes that run through <i>Cubist Castle</i> and (especially) <i>Black Foliage</i>-- a little cohesion amidst all the cacophony-- speckle the edges of the bonus stuff as well, further testament to just how much lightning these guys were bottling. But it's the records themselves-- insistent, wise, daringly imperfect-- that are really the thing here. They remain the sound of a few old friends, a few more new acquaintances, and a thousand wasted sunny days spent carving out a couple mind-bendingly complex masterpieces.</p></div>"|16047.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16047-otc/|9.1|Paul Thompson

And, frankly, for guys who can bang out pop songs like they could, their experimental tendencies are very nearly as impressive; their noise is lush, their silence speaks volumes, and best of all, they're in on the joke. At the end of the extra-long ""Green Typewriters"", Hart jumps into another with a question-as-punchline: ""how much longer can I wait?""</p>
<p>Though <i>Cubist Castle</i> appears untouched, <i>Black Foliage</i> has been remastered from the original tapes; the bass is a bit louder, the vocals a little fuller, and there's ever-so-slightly more clarity in certain patches. But the whirr of some dust-addled four-track still sits underneath these songs, which is as it should be. Either set comes with a download card good for hours upon hours of outtakes, alternates, radio sessions, and the like, much of it unreleased, out-of-print, or otherwise unheard. Taken together, the extra stuff's longer than the albums themselves; hey, nobody ever accused these guys of being especially judicious editors. I'm still working my way through the second disc of the <i>Smile</i> box myself, so all this seemed a little much at first, especially when they launch into their own stoned <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYbSTZYNoUw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Do You Like Worms""</a> medley. But, listening to the extras, you realize just how much they were capable of, just how powerful their overarching vision for these records really was; four minutes from the very good ""The Sky Is a Harpsichord Canvas"" were excised from <i>Black Foliage</i> due to time constraints, and while it's fun to hear the expanded song itself in the spirit of excavation, knowing what didn't make the cut makes the remaining bits seem that much stronger. Flecks of the recurring instrumental themes that run through <i>Cubist Castle</i> and (especially) <i>Black Foliage</i>-- a little cohesion amidst all the cacophony-- speckle the edges of the bonus stuff as well, further testament to just how much lightning these guys were bottling. But it's the records themselves-- insistent, wise, daringly imperfect-- that are really the thing here. They remain the sound of a few old friends, a few more new acquaintances, and a thousand wasted sunny days spent carving out a couple mind-bendingly complex masterpieces.</p></div>"|16047.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16047-otc/|9.4|Paul Thompson

But in its own way, Atlanta is also something like the L.A. of the black music industry, a place where pure, unadulterated pop and club music grows and mutates, and sometimes interacts with the mainstream, like when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4400-ti/"" target=""_blank"">T.I.</a>'s derided <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQJACVmankY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Whatever You Like""</a> became his biggest hit ever. For the most part, though, the purest of Atlanta pop-rap is an underground phenomenon followed feverishly by teens, young adults, and adults who wish they were still young adults (as engrossingly chronicled by Michael Schmelling, Kelefa Sanneh, and Will Welch in their book <i>Atlanta</i>) and whose stars burn quick and fast. D4L and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29609-soulja-boy/"" target=""_blank"">Soulja Boy</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22149-shawty-lo/"" target=""_blank"">Shawty Lo</a> and Yung L.A. have all more or less come and gone, but there are always guys ready to fill the space, if only for six or 12 months. Every high school class has its own heroes.</p>
<p>Future, an Atlanta born and bred singer/rapper, is currently wearing the crown, and if he doesn't prove to have a longer shelf life than most, his star will have maybe burned the brightest. You may know his voice from the hook and second verse of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5w21_Vphbg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Racks""</a> (on racks on racks), one of the biggest club hits of the early year, or from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFLGTT4_lO4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tony Montana""</a>, his current underground smash that features him rapping in a ridiculous voice that's a very rough approximation of that of the movie character. But this is often ridiculous and very rough music, and Future pulls it off well; the song is one of the most fun tracks of the year. Peers are now starting to attach themselves to the guy with the hot hand, too: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> blessed Future with a verse for the ""Tony Montana"" remix, and with the remix to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIqm9AFKgp4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Magic""</a> (his other underground smash), Future somehow secured T.I.'s most recent ""first verse since being released from jail.""</p>
<p><i>Streetz Calling </i>is his most recent mixtape, and to give you an idea of how quickly these things move, none of the aforementioned songs appears. Instead of milking his hits dry, Future is presumably providing a breeding ground for new ones. He's so far basically come as close as anyone to perfecting this thread of ringtone pop, where singing and rapping are practically the same thing, and conversing 100% through Auto-Tune doesn't mean you still can't talk about how you used to sell drugs. It would almost feel antiquated if Future weren't amassing hits, or if he weren't bringing some subtle new dimensions to the micro-genre. His near-complete integration of singing and rapping comes off as something born out of genuine inspiration, and less like a decision made because he's just not very good at rapping (like Yung L.A.) or seemingly bored by the entire idea of it (paging Soulja Boy). He's smooth enough on ""Unconditional Love"" to recall the time when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a>'s Auto-Tune experiments were kind of romantic, and gritty enough on ""Never Be the Same"" to evoke dancehall singers who have used Auto-Tune to accentuate their pain.</p>
<p>There are tracks here that hew closer to rap music, and though some lose his identity in the process, others highlight his ability to move closer to either pole and still make good music. ""Power of That P"", especially, is the work of someone full of ideas, as Future riffs on the letter, tying in everything from ""promethazine"" to ""petroleum"" to ""Peru."" On ""E"" he works fine over a muted brassy beat next to Trouble, one of the city's most promising goon rappers, and on ""The Way it Go"" he sounds right at home over Zaytoven's candy-coated keyboard funk. He's at his best when the amalgamation of rap and pop is more pronounced, but he's good enough when deciding to indulge his gangster impulses.</p>
<p>Future works as prolifically as most artists need to these days, and a number of his tracks, including, say, a third on <i>Streetz Calling</i>,<i> </i>keep it moving without making any sort of impression. It's par for the course for the style of music he's trafficking in and for the way the game is played now, but Future's batting average is notable, and as more of his tracks become hits (however minor), his ability begins to speak for itself. This is pop music before it happens, and Future seems equipped to outlast many of the artists that paved a path for him.</p></div>"|16054.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16054-streetz-calling/|6.9|Jordan Sargent

From <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27940-liturgy/"" target=""_blank"">Liturgy</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28801-locrain/"" target=""_blank"">Locrian</a> to Horseback and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29874-the-atlas-moth/"" target=""_blank"">Atlas Moth</a>, they've each manipulated the decades-old, forever-infamous strain in their own identifiable ways. Whatever your views on Hunter Hunt-Hendrix's verbosity or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26785-kralice/"" target=""_blank"">Krallice</a>'s kinetic cascades, it's inarguable that they've all passed the sounds of corpsepaint and battle axes to bigger, more generalized crowds not overly concerned with someone's respective KVLT credentials. One reason for this, of course, is that these bands generally look and talk mostly like your average rock dudes; they give interviews, tour, and generally wear band T-shirts and tattered jeans. They're not the first North Americans to mutate black metal, neither by a long shot nor by a decade, but they are distinctly identifiable people manipulating a sound that, compared to the indie mainstream, feels exotic and perhaps a tad dangerous.</p>
<p>For the last 15 years, <a href=""http://www.blutausnord.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blut Aus Nord</a>-- the one-man band French musician Vindsval-- has twisted the idea and essence of black metal into new shapes. He's added the crushing reverberations of prime Godflesh and the militant pacing of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2780-ministry/"" target=""_blank"">Ministry</a>, saturating some of his best moments with relentless drones and splintering noise. Several Blut Aus Nord albums are not only incontrovertible classics but also compelling evidence of the obvious-- that all this talk of metal's experimental interests is accurate, if just very overdue. Vindsval hasn't done himself any favors, either: He doesn't tour, doesn't issue album lyrics, and doesn't say much in public. In press photos, he is often hooded and shrouded in darkness. The same hermetic mystique that's helped push artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5849-jandek/"" target=""_blank"">Jandek</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2751-mf-doom/"" target=""_blank"">MF DOOM</a> into an ironic spotlight has mostly kept Blut Aus Nord in, well, the shadows.</p>
<p>But audiences historically love a trilogy, a supposition that, combined with black metal's recent widespread notice, might deservedly help lift Blut Aus Nord out of relative obscurity. After all, the first two installations of the band's three-part <i>777</i> are two of this year's best-built records. <i>777 Sect(s)</i>, released in April, is an obliterative march through rigorous black metal, apocalyptic post-rock, and speaker-rattling industrial tangents. ""Epitome 4"" encapsulated that approach with vocals that sounded as if Vindsval were being strangled by the battery of drums and guitars marching around him with Teutonic precision. Through its 12 minutes, the song took unpredictable turns-- dissonant counter-melodies here, a choir of ghouls there, even almost-pretty tones suggesting some relief in the distance. Unapologetically heavy, <i>Sect(s)</i> was the trilogy's breathless start.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12744-777-the-desanctification/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Desanctification</i></a> is less extreme than its predecessor, with generally shorter tracks (only the opener breaks the eight-minute mark) and even an atmospheric instrumental impasse that's as delicate as it is foreboding. Where <i>Sect(s)</i> raced open on a string of blast beats, stage two lumbers forward with a simple mid-tempo throb. Repetitive guitar lines and stabs of noise circle sickly above. Those background coos from ""Epitome 4"" have grown into a full choir by album-opening ""Epitome 7"". (So far, the series lasts just less than 90 minutes, with each of its 12 tracks named and numbered as a sequential ""Epitome"".) That's not to say <i>Desanctification</i> is an easy-listening experience, as some stretches here are so stuffed with electronic drums and echoing guitars that a claustrophobe could go catatonic listening to it. But the riffs are tempered with a certain accessibility, as with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"" target=""_blank"">Isis</a>-like hook of ""Epitome 10"", and the rhythms occasionally back into something nearly danceable, as with the stuttering clip that quakes through ""Epitome 11"".  Essentially, it's more dynamic than its predecessor, making stops at most every point between the frantic rush of ""Epitome 8"" and the doom-like stasis of ""Epitome 12"". There's more movement, more development, more variety; fitting for a trilogy's middle, it's where the sounds get thicker, where the possibilities simply become more intriguing.</p>
<p>Perhaps Blut Aus Nord's cult status to this point is an unwitting setup for this strange moment, when television stars create parodies of black metal in major music magazines and an alt-country stud hosts a very funny but also very reverent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44413-watch-ryan-adams-metal-comedy-show/"" target=""_blank"">talk show</a> about the stuff. Perhaps this is the moment when the thing that actually does matter-- you know, Blut Aus Nord's music, captured here in a so-far, so-perfect trilogy-- will supplant Vindsval's lack of indie rock-ready gestures, like press photos or Scion showcases. After all, <i>777 Sect(s)</i> and <i>777: The Desanctification</i> are as distinctive and daunting as anything else that's given buzz to black metal this year.</p></div>"|16055.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16055-777-the-desanctification/|8.2|Grayson Currin

In addition to being saddled with one of the most ungainly album titles of the year, <i>Biasonic Hotsauce: Birth of the Nanocloud</i> is the first part of a proposed <i>trilogy</i> of albums where UK garage/drum'n'bass/dubstep producer <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/zedbias"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zed Bias</a> will tell the tale of… an experiment gone wrong? Something vaguely futuristic? To be honest, I've listened to this thing a bunch of times now, and the narrative thrust remains elusive.</p>
<p>And the storyline, confined to a few ignorable skits of kitschy playacting, barely impinges on the music. Instead, the ""Nanocloud"" concept seems more like a flimsy and silly but ultimately harmless way to unite a dozen-plus tracks that might otherwise seem to belong on wholly different albums. Like many producers who refused to go away quietly when grime and dubstep stole UK garage's thunder, Bias has explored as many styles and subgenres as he's been able to get away with since his turn-of-the-millennium UKG glory days. So there's not much of a ""signature"" on <i>Biasonic Hotsauce</i> and certainly not much you haven't heard before if you've been following British dance music for the last 10 years. From hammering dancehall-inflected dubstep to slickly anonymous commercial house, Bias treats <i>BH</i> like an outsider-friendly party tape, heavy on the obvious hooks and boisterous rapping and layer of high-end gloss applied to even the starkest tracks.</p>
<p>This little-bit-of-everything approach to modern UK dance culture is welcome, given how alienating ""pure"" dubstep records can be for non-fans. <i>Biasonic Hotsauce</i> can sometimes feel like an alternate universe take on Kevin Martin's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/539-the-bug/"" target=""_blank"">the Bug</a> project, with the nuclear-grade noise swapped out for radio-friendliness. (Or at least pirate-radio-friendliness.) But the jack-of-all-dance-trades tack also reveals that, for all his restless experimentation, Bias' skill set hasn't evolved much over the last decade. What he does best here-- merging the boom of Jamaican ragga with the runway-show opulence of deep house and the punchy-but-still-pop beats of R&amp;B and soca-- sounds remarkably similar to the sound that first brought him to underground prominence over a decade ago.</p>
<p>The great early run of tracks on <i>BH</i> work the same beguiling and unstable middle ground, where the rhythmic dexterity of high-class dance music for grown-ups meets blunt-force street kid grit, which defined the late-1990s/early-00s peak of UK garage. The low-end of ""Yagga"" has all the thuggish heaviness of dubstep, but the frisky rhythms show up the genre's stereotypical thump as a drag. Though <i>BH</i> has enough bass wobble and crass Ibiza synth hooks to mark it out definitively as a 2011 release, the drums on the first-tier tracks still have the intricate and far more interesting syncopations of old-school garage. It's sad but telling that Bias is still leaning on his biggest and best tune here, 2000's uptown dancehall smash <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZScIt7DvCo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Neighbourhood""</a>, given a wholly unnecessary dubstep-era update for <i>BH</i>.</p>
<p>After that bracing opening stretch, there are a handful of half-brilliant tracks in the same vein strewn across the album, especially the shiver-inducing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12592-lucid-dreams-ft-falty-dl/"" target=""_blank"">""Lucid Dreams""</a>, echoing the minimalist future funk and disembodied vocals that once defined UKG at its outermost, without the dour murk <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a> now brings to the mix. But whenever Bias leaves his comfort zone, the excitement and energy drains away, and he comes up with tracks that settle for being competent style exercises, like ""Koolade"" with its campy take on 1980s boogie. The final trio of ""straight"" dubstep tracks are just too damn polite to even be called bangers, risking neither the grossly enjoyable excess of the genre's populist wing nor the form-pushing innovation of its avant school. As so often when it comes to dance-music full-lengths, Bias' good ideas get lost in the sea of makeweight stuff, and his attempt to please just about everyone results in a frustratingly spotty album.</p></div>"|16046.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16046-bionic-hotsauce-birth-of-the-nanocloud/|6.0|Jess Harvell

The title holds weight, kind of; Onra's French, his familial lineage can be traced back to Vietnam, and-- most importantly-- the album-cum-beat-tape drew heavily from samples of old Chinese and Vietnamese records for dusty boom-bap inspiration. Onra's career has often been about drawing from sounds associated with far-away (for him, anyway) places; last year's brilliant <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14305-long-distance/"" target=""_blank"">Long Distance</a></i> didn't so much appropriate the thick, silky sounds of R&amp;B and funk as it did wear those genres' resemblances like a close-fitting jacket.</p>
<p>Those awaiting a logical follow-up to that release, unfortunately, are going to have to wait a little longer: as the title suggests, his new album <i>Chinoiseries, Pt. 2</i> is a return to the first installment's Asian-samples-meets-hip-hop-beats concept. It's a conceit that, as Onra presumably tips his hat to with this collection's ""One For the Wu"", is not exactly a new one, and Lord Quas knows that beat-tape LPs aren't exactly a scarcity, especially as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">J Dilla</a>'s influence looms large (along with his ability to be name-checked in relation to seemingly everything these days). Onra's pretty good at the beat-tape thing, though, as evidenced by the first <i>Chinoiseries</i> and 2009's comparatively formalist <i>1.0.8</i> (<i>Long Distance</i> is also a similarly built album, just in a very solid, well-structured manner).</p>
<p><i>Chinoiseries, Pt. 2</i>, by comparison, is a strange failure of an album, possibly because the quality of the content seldom (if never) rises above its been-there, heard-that nature. The <i>Pt. 2</i> says it all, really; it's <i>more</i> of the same, diminishing returns and all. The source material contributes to the ""diminishing returns"" part; there are moments when Onra crafts brief gems wielding slow spookiness (""Mais Theme"") and lyrical melodic turns (""Where I'm From""), but there's not much on display in terms of ideas, most tracks wearing out their welcome regardless of their brevity (only a few scattered tracks top out over two minutes).</p>
<p>As an album proper, <i>Chinoiseries, Pt. 2</i> is a bit of a patience-tester. For one, it's long (a mind-boggling 32 tracks that stretch across 58 minutes), and other than a pair of bookending cuts titled ""The Arrival"" and ""The End"", respectively, there's not much here that suggests a thoughtful approach to proper album sequencing. Maybe if we weren't expected to regard this as a proper album instead of what it really is-- a data dump that's enjoyable in small bursts but incredibly spotty as a total body of work-- it wouldn't be so disappointing. The issue, however, is that said disappointment possibly has less to do with the album at hand than the one that preceded it. A potential breakthrough like <i>Long Distance</i>, a record that took a fresh, engaging approach to  form that's been in danger of sounding tired for a minute now, deserves a proper follow-up, or at least an attempt at one. <i>Chinoseries, Pt. 2</i> is neither of those, and that's okay-- it's Onra's career, after all-- but such an allowance doesn't make listening to it any more enjoyable.</p></div>"|16051.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16051-chinoiseries-pt-2/|5.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

Save for one track that ended up on the cutting room floor, <i>Inni</i> was taken from the band's final show in London before their indefinite hiatus and the launch of Jonsi's solo career, the success of which was a foregone conclusion. So it was easy to see <i>Inni</i> as an attempt at a totemic, final word on the Icelandic group or at least a 4Q sweep at completist dollars. As of now, it still does maintain something of a sense of finality, but only as a smartly arranged retrospective of a rewarding decade that began with an unprecedented sound and ended up with the sense that complete ownership of that sound had people taking them for granted.</p>
<p>Though basically any concert performance from Sigur Rós has been considered transcendent due to its underlying material, both of their live documents have had some sort of distinguishing characteristic.<i> </i>2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11630-hvarfheim/"" target=""_blank"">Heima</a> </i>stripped them down to acoustic essentials and Windham Hill vibes, the novelty manifesting in how closely they were willing to lean into their accusations of being New Age For Radiohead Fans. Here, you bear witness to the closest incarnation of Sigur Rós as a <i>rock band </i>comprised of human beings who play stringed instruments you could buy at Target as opposed to some sort of mythic conjurers-- they didn't bring closely associated string quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/253-amiina/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Amiina</a>, a horn section, or a choir, or anything that lumped them into the ""prog"" category outside of song lengths that regularly top eight minutes.</p>
<p>But the lack of literal bells and whistles could've been more out of convenience than a desire to make any sort of artistic point. Thanks to Jónsi's impeccable vocals, a rare falsetto that loses none of its power in a live setting, everything remains indubitably the work of Sigur Rós. Peeling off a few brassy layers isn't going to reveal any sort of true pop songcraft that you might've missed. Likewise, <i>Inni </i>will only be disappointing if you consider a live version as the de facto ""real version"" due to some strict concept of authenticity-- turns out that knowing when and how to employ a horn section is a skill and one the band excels at, so it's understandable that ""Ný Batterí"" and ""Hoppípola"" don't max out quite as volcanically as they do on record.  And if we're being honest, do we really <i>want </i>their back catalog to be humanized? I've always enjoyed ""Med Blódnasir"" as the three rapturous minutes where Sigur Rós thought they were a shoegaze band, but does hearing it sped up to a near punk-rock velocity, flubbed bass notes and all, add any real value? And while a gorgeous, dew-drop piano ballad on its own accord, ""All Alright"" doesn't definitively answer whether <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7151-agaetis-byrjun/"" target=""_blank"">Ágætis Byrjun</a> </i>would be every bit as cherished had it been in English, or any identifiable language for that matter.</p>
<p>But this format does establish commonality between the five studio albums <i>Inni </i>draws from and makes the sequencing and pacing spot-on. This isn't easy to do since none of them really do a good job in terms of substituting for each other. Still, they heavily favor the material that came after 2005's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7155-takk/"" target=""_blank"">Takk</a>, </i>a crucial pivot where Sigur Rós started to be slotted into what might be considered ""conventional"" songwriting, or at least transcendence doled out more succinctly and frequently. Even when removed from its amniotic cocoon, ""Svefn-G-Englar"" moves tectonically, its cathartic, minor key rupture lasting about 20 seconds on a track that's got 10 more minutes. Fast forward five years, and ""Hoppípola"" sounds like the most anthemic part of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3853-snow-patrol/"" target=""_blank"">Snow Patrol</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS8IZcx7tJY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Run""</a> isolated for reproduction in a Petri dish, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/893-vi-spilum-endalaust/"" target=""_blank"">""Vid Spilum Endalaust""</a> could pass for one of the most instantly catchy songs from either <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4872-mew/"" target=""_blank"">Mew</a> <i>or</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2872-muse/"" target=""_blank"">Muse</a>.</p>
<p>Still, even if Sigur Rós do plan on picking back up, <i>Inni </i>rewards those ruthlessly evaluating it based on whether it's a legit substitute for the real thing. Its purchase price is within the range of a face-value concert ticket, but the truth is, I find no reason to begrudge anyone who'd prefer <i>Inni</i>, much like I don't hold it against people who'd rather watch an NFL game in the comfort of their own home, considering the ratio of awe-inspiring catharsis to buildup. After all, the 15 minutes of ""Popplagid"" (aka ""Untitled 8"") are an investment when you've elected to consume <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7152-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank"">( ) </a></i>in its entirety, but here you have to evaluate whether it's worth taking up space that more viscerally satisfying songs like ""Gobbledigook"" or ""Gong"" could've filled.  Practically anyone can admit that two consecutive hours of Sigur Rós is a lot to take in, and if you need to take a bathroom break or check your Fantasy Football lineup after ""E-Bow"" closes out the first disc, there's no shame in that. After all, if the point of <i>Inni </i>is to prove that Sigur Rós are human, why can't we be given the same luxury in their presence?</p></div>"|16041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16041-inni/|7.2|Ian Cohen

It's a tough game to play, but thanks to songwriter Gareth Campesinos' wry humor and self-deprecation, the band has been able to make a career out of writing songs where breakups literally equal death. The music is intensely personal, but it's equally as inclusive-- Gareth paints himself as having it worse than anyone, but the unspoken acknowledgment that makes the band churn is that he really just has it as bad as everyone else.</p>
<p><i>Hello Sadness </i>is the band's fourth album, and though not much has changed with the band itself, the ground underneath which LC! stand has shifted. Gareth's style of writing-- naked oversharing that goes far past the margins of his pad-- used to feel like a natural outgrowth of the type of discourse found at places like LiveJournal and Blogger, but those mediums are dinosaurs now, replaced by the opacity of Tumblr and the short, controlled blasts of Twitter. Likewise, the band's serrated twee is not exactly in fashion in the world of indie rock right now, a truth that's an undercurrent of their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/40957-los-campesinos-start-zine-release-xmas-song/"" target=""_blank"">announcement</a> late last year that they would be distributing a quarterly fanzine. But, if LC! are the last men and women left holding the flag for an antiquated era of indie rock, it has only intensified their vitality to those looking for more than chillwave's call to tune in, turn on, and drop out.</p>
<p>Though the album is arguably the band's darkest yet, it starts off with both the album's peppiest song and one of LC!'s best singles to date. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43930-listen-new-los-campesinos-by-your-hand/"" target=""_blank"">""By Your Hand""</a> finds Gareth at the very infancy of a budding romance, and it casts him as a sort of lovable hero, a role that he inhabits when he's not, say, fantasizing about burning the skin off his hands before going to a palmist. Gareth narrates himself initiating another round of dirty texting before breaking into one of the more memorable passages he's penned: his fooling around with ""fate""-- ""a cruel mistress, girl""-- who suggests that the two go back to her place, where ""fate"" then, naturally, vomits on him. He does this with gusto, which is accentuated by the chorus, wherein the entire band shouts, ""By your hand is the only end that I foresee."" The exuberance, not just for the romance itself but for his eventual end at the hand of his lover, is crucial to Gareth's ability to write songs about what happens when the relationship is at the other end of the spectrum. We know that he's always coming back for more, even when the rest of us can't stomach it.</p>
<p>Otherwise <i>Hello Sadness </i>is an album largely obsessed with themes of despair and images of death, but Gareth is an able gallows humorist. On the album's final track he enters a slaughterhouse where he sees his guts strung up, only for him to be turned away because ""his sad eyes are too much to bear."" On ""Baby, I Got the Death Rattle"" he gets frostbite from scribbling dicks in the snow for every girl that wouldn't sleep with him before watching a halo slip from the top of his lover's head and, presumably, decapitate her. And then there is ""Every Defeat a Divorce (Three Lions)"", Gareth's long-coming ode to the English soccer team, wherein crosses on the pitch become crucifixes and the team's crest nearly claws him to death. It is the album's centerpiece, if only because for Gareth, and for a lot of us, the one thing more wrenching than romance is sports.</p>
<p>These songs are genuinely affecting, though, both because they explore the darkest depths of a romantic's psyche and because LC! have transitioned rather seamlessly into maturity. The fizzy, excitable songwriting of their early output is far in the past, and they've learned to write songs that build and swell to moments that can knock you off your feet (""To Tundra"" is the killer here). Gareth also explores his range as a vocalist to great success, stretching himself to sing melodically and in a strikingly deeper voice. His vocals have long been a breaking point for many non-converts, and while Gareth hasn't morphed into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29959-king-krule/"" target=""_blank"">King Krule</a>, his impressive singing here bodes well for the future of a band whose music largely revolves around him.</p>
<p>The buzz has long worn off of Los Campesinos!, but <i>Hello Sadness </i>is their fourth straight great album, and each of them is close enough in quality that you'd likely get split numbers if you conducted a straw poll at one of the band's shows. Even if there is no breakthrough moment for them, there is something to be said for a band that is this young, this consistent, and this committed to both carrying the torch for and freshening up a style of indie rock that has, for the moment at least, been left behind.</p></div>"|16036.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16036-hello-sadness/|8.0|Jordan Sargent

In internet years, that's practically a decade, but then, Korallreven and their fellow countrymen work at a pace that exists outside normal measurements of time (the exception being <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27763-jj/"" target=""_blank"">jj</a>, who seemingly churn out slices of heavy-lidded pop at will). It took Korallreven close to a year to follow ""Loved-Up"" with last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14246-the-truest-faith/"" target=""_blank"">""The Truest Faith""</a>; the arrival of <i>An Album by Korallreven</i> itself was promised for later in 2010. Considering bedroom dreamers have been waiting four years (and counting) for a follow-up to <span class=""st"">Gothenburg duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5358-the-tough-alliance/"" target=""_blank"">the </a></span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5358-the-tough-alliance/"" target=""_blank"">Tough Alliance</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10668-a-new-chance/"" target=""_blank"">A New Chance</a></i>, though, maybe we're lucky <i>An Album by Korallreven</i> exists at all.</p>
<p>They do have things in common with the Tough Alliance beyond citizenship and a leisurely working pace: Both acts are duos, both embrace a color palette of popular music so widespread it's difficult to describe what they make with a catch-all descriptor, and both ultimately draw deep from indie pop's dewy-eyed tradition (Korallreven especially-- one half of the band's Daniel Tjäder, who spends time leafing through the Sarah and Labrador catalogues as a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4760-the-radio-dept/"" target=""_blank"">the Radio Dept.</a>) For all their sentiments, the Tough Alliance are also arch and fairly political; Korallreven, on the other hand, are more concerned with surface beauty, applying layers of gauze that add immense, weightless density to their own pop delicacies.</p>
<p>In a sense, it's music that you don't necessarily have to think about, which is fine, of course-- even the most bookish of Sincerely Yours/Service/Acéphale completists need something to lose themselves in now and again. The album's shortest cut, ""A Surf on Endorphins"", is a redux  of ""The Truest Faith""'s rolling theme, awash in coyote howls and static  distance. As its title suggests, the song's meant to provoke emotion,  albeit far from the energized sort. During the bleeping, hypnotic centerpiece ""Keep Your Eyes Shut"", the  phrase, ""A dream within a dream,"" is repeated like a mantra.</p>
<p>Indie pop's history dictates that many of its practitioners are, first and foremost, ardent fans of the music that's influenced the music they make; accordingly, Tjäder and cohort Marcus Joons come across less as artists as they do expert curators. They move from the 808s of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12409-as-young-as-yesterday-ft-victoria-bergsman/"" target=""_blank"">""As Young as Yesterday""</a> (a signifier reminiscent  of once-label mates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27383-salem/"" target=""_blank"">Salem</a>, whom Korallreven have featured in mixes  frequently) to the space-disco-via-pastoral-ambient beauty of  nine-minute album closer ""Comin' Down"" with the ease of a single  brushstroke. The pair's series of mixes (the most recent being <i>A Dream Within a Dream</i>) flow with expert sequencing that betrays the amateur nature of mix culture circa 2011.</p>
<p>It's no surprise, then, that <i>An Album by Korallreven</i> works best as an album-length experience, its structure suggesting a sort of trip-- spiritual or chemical or otherwise. It's an album of quiet excellence, one that aims to soundtrack your most idle thoughts while romantically demanding your attention. That said, it doesn't really matter how <i>An Album by Korallreven</i> resonates within <i>our</i> world, when Tjäder and Joons are so intent in creating their own.</p></div>"|16042.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16042-an-album-by-korallreven/|7.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

Of the many emerging dark, female-fronted acts, they've got some of the slickest packaging, complete with a name derived from a grisly Danish fairy tale and a list of ""Band Interests"" on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/esbenandthewitch?sk=info"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> that concludes with, ""Victoriana, Romance, Ghosts."" The follow-up to their debut full-length, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15082-violet-cries/"" target=""_blank"">Violet Cries</a></i>-- a new EP called <i>Hexagons</i>-- takes their curative framework a step further-- it's a concept piece made up of six Roman-numerically ordered ""Hexagons"" with dramatic parentheticals: ""Hexagons I (The Fall)"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12540-hexagons-ii-the-flight/"" target=""_blank"">""Hexagons II (The Flight)""</a>, et cetera. Its release also coincided with a week-long webcast event called ""Hexagons Cinema"", in which the band streamed a series of footage shot in the UK's oldest functioning cinema. At the very least, Esben have shown themselves fine scholars of textbook aspects of spook. But much like on <i>Violet Cries</i>, all of <i>Hexagons</i>' thoughtful ornamentation only emphasizes how frustratingly plotless the songs are.</p>
<p>These songs are sparer than much of the material from <i>Violet Cries</i>, often centered around dramatic piano lines and bare acoustic guitar sheathed in haunting echoes. The bookending tracks, ""Hexagons I (The Fall)"" and ""Hexagons VI (The Thaw)"", aren't even so much songs as they are brief, ambient reminders of the grim mood the trio wants you to experience but seems incapable of fleshing out. By comparison, ""Hexagons II (The Flight)"" and ""Hexagons III (The Surge)"" sound tightly structured and concussive. But they still fall flat: The latter, for instance, hints at the band's promising post-rock tendencies by building a thick, apocalyptic guitar line, but before it's allowed to peak and crash, it peters out and devolves into more thin, aimless piano. None of these cuts reach the guttural fullness of <i>Violet Cries</i> cuts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14737-marching-song/"" target=""_blank"">""Marching Song""</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15007-warpath/"" target=""_blank"">""Warpath""</a>, two strong tracks that probably should have been used as templates for Esben's future recordings. Instead, they instilled listeners with what now feels like false hope. In the absence of compelling cores, these songs are carried, sometimes solely, by frontwoman Rachel Davies' strong and brooding British-accented vocals.</p>
<p><i>Hexagons</i> also emphasizes the extent to which the indiesphere wants to embrace a goth revival in the wake of the success of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"" target=""_blank"">Zola Jesus</a>, and it highlights an experimental phase that can easily misfire. There's a sense here that these dark waters are being tested unsuccessfully, explored using well-crafted embellishments without the raw songwriting materials needed to deliver on their promise.</p></div>"|16045.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16045-hexagons-ep/|5.2|Carrie Battan

The music released under the name <a href=""http://www.faitiche.de/index.php?article_id=9"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ursula Bogner</a>-- first an album called <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12694-recordings-1969-1988/"" target=""_blank"">Recordings 1969-1988</a></i>, now a follow-up collection called <i>Sonne = Blackbox</i>-- is an excellent example of what he was talking about. Released on Faitiche, the label started by veteran electronic music producer and theorist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2182-jan-jelinek/"" target=""_blank"">Jan Jelinek</a>, this music is purported to come from a woman who was completely unknown during her lifetime and died in 1994. Bogner is said to have lived a life as a housewife and experimented with electronics and tapes away from the public eye, and the music she left behind fits loosely with that made by BBC Radiophonic Workshop experimentalists like Daphne Oram and Delia Derbyshire.</p>
<p>Instead of maintaining the ruse as a cynical PR cash-in-- which would be silly because, let's face it, very few people are going to spend money for this music-- Jelinek is treating the Bogner phenomenon as a multimedia art experiment with musical, textual, and performative components. This second set of Bogner-named works, allegedly curated by frequent Jelinek associate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5325-andrew-pekler/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Pekler</a>, comes packaged with a 130-page book that explores, in pieces written in both English and German, ideas of identity, ownership, gender, and more, along with probing how information is transmitted through the media.</p>
<p>There's a piece in the book by songwriter and commentator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2806-momus/"" target=""_blank"">Momus</a> and lengthy interviews conducted by Jelinek, where, among other things, he interrogates people on why the Bogner story seems fake. The interviews in particular are an essential part of this project, because they get at how listeners construct narratives around music. One answer to Jelinek's question about the skepticism surrounding Bogner boils down to the press release being too detailed as far as her biography and making too much of her being a housewife. The exchange highlights how music journalists glean ""truth"" from the printed matter they are presented with recordings, and how this exchange can be manipulated. Beyond the accompanying book, Jelinek and Pekler are currently playing the music of Ursula Bogner at shows, improvising new music to accompany her ""old"" tape loops.</p>
<p>In addition to the writing, the book, and the live revue, we also have this, an album of recorded sound that, given its unspecified origins, exists in the context of your choosing. And I'm happy to report that the music is mostly very good, especially if you are a fan of Jelinek's loop-based aesthetic and unfailing ear for texture and musical structure (an approach to sound that has a great deal of overlap with Pekler's recorded work). Whether created by Jelinek, Pekler, or someone else, the Bogner pieces range from engaging electronic curiosities-- notable mostly for mixing vintage-sounding electronics with editing that would have been very difficult to achieve in the year they were supposed to have been created-- to hair-raising collages whose subtle force is, if you're wired at all like I am, completely overpowering.</p>
<p>The pieces here have a general theme, and that is the manipulation of the human voice. The opening title track mixes a banging piano loop with gorgeously rendered vocoder tones, conveying that peculiarly 1950s Disneyfied optimism about the happiness of a robotic future. ""Or Dor Melanor"" consists of a female voice singing the title's words laid next to some weirdly distant vocals processed into an ascending scale. ""Shepard Monde"" is a cracked assemblage of French syllables that sort of hangs together in a twitching clump, but the effect as it moves between the speakers evokes both mystery and profound beauty. ""De Planetarum Influxu"" mixes sine-wave squiggles and a deep drone with a mass of unclassifiable and machine-like voices that seem to be drifting steadily toward you, and then, at the moment when they could get no louder, the piece abruptly cuts off, ending the album on a jarring note. It all works together and there's not a dull patch on the record.</p>
<p>The tracks without vocals mostly recall the kind of elemental electronic tinkering present on the earlier Bogner release, but in ever case the dusty electronic pulses are brought to life with a sense of rhythm, movement, and texture that can be easily connected to records like Jelinek's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4237-kosmischer-pitch/"" target=""_blank"">Kosmischer Pitch</a></i> and Pekler's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10358-cue/"" target=""_blank"">Cue</a></i>. If this were a new album by either of them, it would be enjoyable and ultimately successful purely from a musical standpoint, but packaged as it is as part of the Bogner project, the music can't help but take on a different cast. If nothing else, <i>Sonne = Blackbox</i> is an excellent reminder of Jelinek's restless muse. He made a name with an unusual approach to sound developed during the IDM heyday of the 1990s and early 00s, but he's never stayed in one place long, and every project he's been involved with since offers an unfamiliar but ultimately rewarding world to be explored.</p></div>"|16044.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16044-sonne-blackbox/|7.4|Mark Richardson

Though some of this was a bit reactionary and a by-product of their roots in the nascent indie rock scene of the 1980s, it was mainly a consequence of one of the band's most admirable qualities-- a restless desire to reinvent themselves with each record and create a discography in which each new entry had a distinct character. This much was clear by 1984: R.E.M. could have mined indefinitely the fascinating blend of murky atmosphere and crystal clear chiming guitar parts on their debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12464-murmur-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Murmur</a></i>-- lord knows many other bands of the era tried-- but they took a left turn into the sunnier, more lyrically direct <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13130-reckoning-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Reckoning</a> </i>and kept throwing curveballs at their audience from that point onward.</p>
<p>This tendency yielded a rich body of work spanning 15 studio albums, but the creative shifts-- however organic they may seem in context-- gave listeners valid reasons to jump ship along the way. It makes just as much sense to enjoy all their records as it does for someone who favors Peter Buck's early jangle-centric guitar style to recoil at his flamboyantly distorted tone on <i>Monster</i>, or for fans of their immensely popular chamber pop records <i>Out of Time</i> and <i>Automatic for the People </i>to shrug off the skewed, highly politicized arena rock of their late 80s records. This isn't even factoring in the uneven albums they made following the departure of original drummer and songwriter Bill Berry, which spanned from the tentative lounge pop of <i>Up</i> to the often dreary melodrama of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6752-around-the-sun/"" target=""_blank"">Around the Sun</a></i> and the ""back to basics"" rock of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11308-accelerate/"" target=""_blank"">Accelerate</a></i>.</p>
<p>With this in mind, <i>Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage: 1982-2011--</i> the band's first career-spanning anthology-- does an exceptional job of presenting this body of work as a chronological survey that neatly summarizes their major themes and artistic tangents while being highly listenable. The song selection is exceptional-- a few relatively minor singles didn't make the cut, but every major hit is here, presented alongside crucial album tracks such as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boUZmibXQUQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Country Feedback""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rePNg6MmdEQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Begin the Begin""</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJJwjE2TG6Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Life and How to Live It""</a>. The quality of the material up through at least the middle of the second disc is unimpeachable; the sheer concentration of classic tunes makes a strong case for the band ranking among the 20th century's greatest songwriting partnerships. The set handles the band's leaner years with grace and minimal revisionism, though the electronic and ambient textures of <i>Up</i> are sidelined in favor of that album's delicate Beach Boys homage <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXs66BPooY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""At My Most Beautiful""</a>. A few wild card selections from their more recent records, such as <i>Accelerate</i>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcgovY-H8uA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Living Well Is the Best Revenge""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGTXL10l-w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter""</a> from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15184-collapse-into-now/"" target=""_blank"">Collapse Into Now</a></i>, shine in this context.</p>
<p>Nearly every hits set must include previously unreleased material, and this one is no different. The three new tracks featured here are the final completed songs of the band's career and serve as a coda of sorts for their recorded output. The single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44428-watch-kirsten-dunst-in-rems-we-all-go-back-to-where-we-belong-video/"" target=""_blank"">""We All Go Back to Where We Belong""</a> is the keeper; a wistful ballad with a delightfully schmaltzy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/619-burt-bacharach/"" target=""_blank"">Burt Bacharach</a>-like arrangement that barely conceals its subtext of basically being about the end of R.E.M. The other two cuts sound like a band crossing a few ideas off their bucket list before calling it a day: ""Hallelujah"" comes off like them giving one last attempt at nailing the hazy sophisti-pop they explored on <i>Reveal</i>, while the dreadful ""A Month of Saturdays"" meets the title's ""garbage"" requirement by sounding as though they realized at the last moment that they never wrote a song about loving the weekend and scrambled to remedy that with only a few minutes of studio time.</p>
<p>Though R.E.M.'s dissolution is not necessarily a cause for celebration, having a clearly defined end point makes it much easier to grasp the scope of their achievements. Part of a collective anxiety about R.E.M.'s ongoing existence up until this year was based in a desire on the part of the audience to impose a manageable narrative on their career. Now that they have disbanded, it's much easier to understand the trajectory of their post-Berry output in particular: Basically, they spent some time in the 2000s trying out new sounds and ways of working, but they eventually reconnected with their rock'n'roll roots before wrapping up their career with <i>Collapse Into Now</i>, a set of songs that revisited their creative strengths. Those records are never going to as beloved as their first 10 brilliant and remarkably consistent albums with Berry, but <i>Part Lies</i> makes a good case that their later period has value too, and that the group had raised the bar so high for themselves that merely being very good could be interpreted as a failure.</p></div>"|16032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16032-part-lies-part-heart-part-truth-part-garbage-1982-2011/|9.4|Matthew Perpetua

More than a few of these artists were capitalizing off the hype that surrounded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a>'s debut record <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16026-liveloveaap/"" target=""_blank"">LiveLoveA$AP</a></i>, a release the internet noise machine took up as its latest cause. Freddie Gibbs may remember that honeymoon period well; a couple of years back, he was the focus of this ruthless media blitz, an artist who rocketed suddenly from major-label reject to being <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2009/10/26/091026crmu_music_frerejones?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mentioned in <i>The New Yorker</i></a>. It was an odd position for a rapper whose persona often felt like a simple amalgamation of 1990s Rap-A-Lot records. One of the unfortunate things about this hype cycle is its obsession with novelty at the expense of quality; Gibbs isn't a new artist any more, but <i>Cold Day in Hell </i>is arguably his most well-rounded, accomplished offering. It isn't that he's improved as a rapper, but as an artist. He has recognized his weaknesses and produced a lush, versatile record that works around them.</p>
<p>Gibbs, as a performer, has always been a skilled technician, but in the backlash that followed his early acclaim, some pointed out that his rapping could be dry and impersonal. In impressing folks caught up in the theatrical onslaught of his driving delivery, it was easy for fans to miss the big picture. At his weakest, he is a technician first and a conversationalist second. For his core fanbase, this is the appeal: gangster rap with brutality and self-control the primary goal. These shortcomings become evident, though, when you compare Gibbs to a rapper like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"" target=""_blank"">Young Jeezy</a>, whose economy, directness, and charisma burst through the speakers on a track like ""Twos and Fews"". But what Gibbs has accomplished on <i>Cold Day in Hell</i> is a challenge to the reliable audience that would prefer him in autopilot mode, and it actually gives his music a lot more replay value. As on his strongest releases, he uses a variety of strategies that value musicality above all.</p>
<p>A major contributor to Gibbs' success here is producer Cardo. His beats have an ethereal, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>-lite quality, although Cardo works in a more mercenary, less brand-conscious context. There are also more than enough R&amp;B hooks here to scare away the one-note Gibbs fan. These tracks actually introduce a tension and excitement into Gibbs' work that is often missed when he's worked with typical boom-bap production. The perfect example is album highlight ""B.A.N.ned"". Cardo's chopped-up vocal loop infuses the tracks with a haunting melancholy, framing Gibbs' vocals-- always taut with aggression-- with a strong emotional undercurrent. But it's not a one-way transaction; Gibbs' dark story rap on ""My Homeboy's Girlfriend"" is a disquieting factor that charges Cardo's evocative <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"" target=""_blank"">Sade</a> sample. Gibbs' voice is monotone, but it gains a stark power when the music that surrounds it lunges for an emotional jugular.</p>
<p>The record's diverse sound shows a wider range of influences than previous releases. SMKA's beat for the Juicy J-featuring ""Str8 Slammin'"" is a sparkling imitation of the kind of moody arpeggios the Hypnotized Minds camp pioneered a decade ago. Cardo's ""Menace II Society"" is such a pitch-perfect spiritual son of California's gangster rap peak that you'll be pulling out your Celly Cel tapes (or running to RapidShare). One of the album's best moments is ""Anything to Survive"", which samples Bobbi Humphrey's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i_Ja2sVw1g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Harlem River Drive""</a> and includes verses from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5547-freeway/"" target=""_blank"">Freeway</a> and underrated Chicago rapper Sly Polaroid. What unites these disparate archetypes is Gibbs himself. What once seemed like a limitation-- the straightforward affect of his rapping-- now serves to balance some riskier, prettier experiments. His dimension and focus here should give pause to those who've discounted him.</p></div>"|16024.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16024-freddie-gibbs-cold-day-in-hell/|8.2|David Drake

The one-man boom began on last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13968-a-sufi-and-a-killer/"" target=""_blank"">A Sufi and a Killer</a></i>, where San Diego-bred Sumach Ecks split the difference between Western aggression, Eastern mysticism, and extraterrestrial idiosyncrasy. Even his stage name is a compound noun: half weed, half wisdom. All rolled up into a blunt, banshee wail.</p>
<p>Released on Warp, <i>A Sufi and a Killer</i> was both futuristic and primitive, a glass pyramid breaking under the weight of his psychedelic bombed squad: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28105-the-gaslamp-killer/"" target=""_blank"">the Gaslamp Killer</a>, and Mainframe. The evil spirit was summoned by a 32-year old ex-underground MC who found his sediment-strangled singing voice via Bikram Yoga, high grade chronic, and magic mushrooms. A biblically bearded original prone to Twitter jeremiads against the contemporary age of ""LITTLE SAMBO AND HIS PACK OF DEVIL WORSHIPPING BARBIES."" He routinely stresses love, understanding, and the violent overthrow of government-- a peace-seeking yogi who will slap the shit out of you for talking reckless. Some things are not supposed to be logical.</p>
<p>Based in ""the Mojave,"" the desert-dwelling prophet dropped <i>The 9th Inning </i>EP last month. We owe the free, four-song collection's existence to an arrangement between Sufi and viral video/mixtape portal, Hydroshare. He gets paid for old tracks that had been infecting his hard drives since being first recorded several years ago. We get new music to hold us over until his mini-album <i>MU.ZZ.LE </i>drops in January.</p>
<p>From the first words of <i>The 9th Inning,</i> we're sucked into apocalypse. Industrial noises clank like robots led to the guillotine. John Carpenter synths ooze and ""Demonchild"" starts with Sufi croaking, ""My mama says son/ Look what the world's coming to/ My mama was right/ The sun is colored blue."" What makes Gonjasufi's music so singular is that voice, suspended somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6208-george-clinton/"" target=""_blank"">George Clinton</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Waits</a>, and something that crawled out of the La Brea Tar Pits-- prehistoric and warped from thousands of pounds of pressure.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12645-eatfish-ft-blu/"" target=""_blank"">""Eat Fish""</a> finds Ecks hanging ectoplasmic hooks on boom-bap drums and raps from L.A. left-fielder Blu. The chorus' moral: ""be rich, eat fish, and die."" It's sage advice partially cribbed from the Wu-Tang Clan's Ghostface Killah, and indeed, the spirit of Wu-Tang hangs heavy over this project. With its stripped down organ loops and dusted drums, ""The Lows"", sounds like a distant cousin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1778-gravediggaz/"" target=""_blank"">Gravediggaz</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4285-tricky/"" target=""_blank"">Tricky</a>'s <i>The Hell</i> EP. Opting to spit his tiger style raps, Sufi channels the unhinged delirium of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3214-ol-dirty-bastard/"" target=""_blank"">Ol' Dirty Bastard</a>. There are cold-blooded threats of ""wandering eyes getting poked"" and the difficulties of keeping oaths not to kill when there are ""vampires walking around with smiles on their grill.""<span> </span>Lest you think there is a clear father to his style, he calls on ""savasana"" for calm-- the corpse pose in yoga.</p>
<p>Nor can you define the title track. It's not quite rap, and even though it's partially sung, it's light years from R&amp;B. Disembodied vocals coo in the background, and Sufi sounds like someone who attempted to conjure <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10608-nate-dogg/"" target=""_blank"">Nate Dogg</a> at a séance and received a demented ghost from a nearby dimension.<span> </span>It's unclear whether he's singing or rapping, and that's the point. It's otherworldly and unclassifiable. Or as he chants about a former partner, ""similarities in our style, but I took it from here. I took it from here."" Enter the demon.</p></div>"|16038.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16038-the-9th-inning-ep/|7.6|Jeff Weiss

It came out on an Amsterdam-only 12"" with little clue as to ""BNJMN""'s identity. What we did have to go on was the gorgeous music carved into those grooves: All woozy arpeggios and fuzzy chiming chords, the track felt both majestically modern yet mournfully nostalgic, a lost artifact worn as much by time as by digital filters. It was an odd fit for a label known best for its comprehensive house reissue series, but Benjamin Thomas' debut album, <i>Plastic World</i>, revealed how deep ""Blocks""'s nostalgia went.</p>
<p><i>Plastic World</i>, an album mixing soft-focus IDM introspection with the ongoing house and hip-hop flirtations of so much contemporary ""bass music,"" more than lived up to the promise of ""Blocks"". Thomas' formula felt more natural than most. What was also striking about BNJMN was not just that he nailed his reference points (ambient and bleep techno, early Warp Records), but that he had little disregard for what was going on around him aside from what he could and lift and mould to his own specifications. Even when he was playing with familiar structures-- sometimes he sounded like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29245-teebs/"" target=""_blank"">Teebs</a>, other times he sounded like early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"" target=""_blank"">Autechre</a>-- there was something wonderfully private about it all, as if he were coming at these ideas from behind some impenetrable screen of idiosyncrasy. It was a 40-minute album that easily swelled beyond its own meager confines, a spontaneous overflow of engaging musical ideas that managed to carve a palpable pocket into an overcrowded scene even as it stared in from the borderlands.</p>
<p>Released bewilderingly quickly-- only eight months after its predecessor-- <i>Black Square</i> finds its own success in the reduction of nearly everything that made <i>Plastic World </i>so appealing. Much like the bare cover art, the music methodically removes the extraneous elements from Thomas' deliberately blurry sound and leaves every cog in the machine starkly visible. Even in a realm where repetition is the rule, there's something about Thomas' work that can feel especially rigid: On <i>Plastic World</i> it was a smearing effect that created a dreamy swirl; on <i>Black Square</i> we feel all the ugly edges and jagged rims. The mechanic has a lot in common with producers currently experimenting with footwork forms and other uptempo musics: Take ""Keep the Power Out"", where a harshly chopped vocal phrase and persistently ticking rimshot fashion a symphony of frantic monotony. The effect is still as hypnotic and engrossing as ever, but this time it feels more tactile and real, easier to grasp in its dressed-down guise.</p>
<p>It's this new naked physicality that makes <i>Black Square </i>an even more exciting prospect than past work. Thomas wields the kick drum like a mighty weapon, and the way the record moves from the wooden clack of ""Primal Pathways"" to its midpoint climax of ""Open the Floodgates"" is spectacular. We're given hints with the pulse underneath tracks like the whimsical ""Wisdom of Uncertainty"" and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvet Underground</a>-sampling title track, but when that simple kick drops a minute into ""Floodgates"", it's the weight of the real world, the weight of true dance music crashing into BNJMN's cultivated electronica fantasies. It's a formidable strike that highlights texture as <i>Black Square</i>'s most important element: The tracks thereafter feel like a hangover from the relative abandon of ""Floodgates"", but they're rich and sensual. The dulcet tones, flinty synths, and buoyant guitars of ""Lava"" are an aural feast, and closer ""Hallowed Road"" is a teasingly sparse disintegration that unwinds the album through resonance and hum-and-buzz, the undoing of the bubbly melodies that were the erstwhile dominant force in Thomas' compositions.</p>
<p><i>Black Square</i> is definitely not a retread of <i>Plastic World</i>, but it's not the predictable expand-and-improve sophomore effort either. It's a brave sort of refinement that brings what was special about <i>Plastic World</i> into even finer relief: Brimming with opposing currents, from nostalgia to fantasy to decadence and dread, <i>Black Square</i> is not the simple world it appears to be at first, yet it's simple enough to digest. At 32 minutes, it makes a heavier indent than its lengthier sibling and is a more assured statement than most dance albums. It doesn't matter that it comes on one of house music's most lauded archival labels, because BNJMN's music is timeless, and it belongs on an imprint known for securing dance music history rather than one focused on its trendy and fickle future.</p></div>"|15986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15986-black-square/|7.8|Andrew Ryce

As with other restless-spirit heavy outfits from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5803-nachtmystium/"" target=""_blank"">Nachtmystium</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2699-mastodon/"" target=""_blank"">Mastodon</a>, you can still detect an original accent in the work of this L.A.-via-Miami band; but at this stage, they're speaking a whole other language-- call it pop-savvy prog. And on <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12755-carbon-based-anatomy-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Carbon-Based Anatomy</i></a>, Cynic's second EP since an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/7554-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank"">outstanding</a> 2008 reunion full-length, <i>Traced in Air</i>, they're communicating with remarkable fluency.</p>
<p>Cynic's roots stretch back to the fertile early-1990s Florida death-metal scene. Before issuing their own proper debut, the band's co-leaders, guitarist-vocalist Paul Masvidal and drummer Sean Reinert, scored a high-profile freelance gig, backing Death leader Chuck Schuldiner on <i>Human</i>. The concise title of that 1991 classic belies its groundbreaking blend of ferocity and technicality-- not to mention its inescapable influence on the next two decades of chops-happy extreme metal. (A great-sounding <a href=""http://www.relapse.com/human-3cd-deluxe-reissue.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reissue</a> is out on Relapse if you're curious.) The pair quickly jumped ship, though, and got to work on its own definitive statement, 1993's rich, puzzling <i>Focus</i>. Even on this first LP, Cynic seemed to regard metal like a vestigial tail. Guest vocalist Tony Teegarden contributed anguished, growling vocals that recalled Schuldiner's, but Masvidal augmented his lines with a pre-Auto-Tune robot speak. And while the band indulged in outbursts of hard-hitting shred, they avoided death metal's signature blastbeats outright, favoring supple rhythms drawn straight from the jazz-fusion playbook.</p>
<p>If <i>Focus</i> had an ugly-duckling appeal, Cynic's hybrid experiment didn't pay off fully until <i>Traced in Air</i>, which followed a 15-year hiatus. The comeback effort pushed metal even further into the background in favor of an increased melodicism; suddenly Cynic seemed like a new standard bearer for 21st-century art rock, flooring you with their technicality while mashing on all your bliss buttons. The record took what it needed from extreme metal (growled backing vocals), fusion (tricky turnarounds and ornate solos), and pop (open-hearted hooks). This was a band unmoored from genre but not adrift: The songs were pointing the way, rather than any regard for a clearly definable style. Underscoring that point, the band followed <i>Traced in Air</i> with 2010's <i>Re-Traced</i>, an EP that adapted four of the full-length's tunes in a calmer style, with the metal-- and, for the most part, rock-- siphoned out in favor of folky pop and electronica. It was a startling move, but the material held up.</p>
<p><i>Carbon-Based Anatomy</i>, consisting of all-new material, is more substantial than <i>Re-Traced</i>, the next best thing to a new LP. A 23-minute suite of six continuous tracks, the EP restores the band's aggressive side but only in measured doses. The three proper songs here-- presented along with a trio of soundscapey mood setters-- are easily Cynic's most accessible to date, favoring straightforward verse-chorus anthems and ditching the death-metal-styled vocals outright. Yet they're also some of the band's strongest, further proof that Masvidal and Reinert's core ideas are sturdy enough to withstand drastic shifts in style.</p>
<p>The title track is a perfectly paced stunner. A sensuous, tribal-y verse (which finds Reinert locking in with <i>Focus</i>-era Cynic bassist Sean Malone, who guests on the EP) alternates with a placid guitar-and-voice passage, mapping out the piece's sing-songy motifs. After a dreamy fusion interlude, the aggression ramps up: Masvidal solos triumphantly, and the band kicks into a stomping, crunchy climax, over which Masvidal recasts the earlier guitar-voice melody as a yearning anthem. Usually not one to present his vocals undisguised, he sings sans effects here and achieves a new emotional directness. The track lasts more than six minutes, but it feels trim, even radio-ready. It's fitting that Masvidal sings about transcending the body (""Drop the knife/ Leave your arms behind/ Just for a moment""); on a piece like this, Cynic sounds fully liberated, not just from their metal past but from any aesthetic concern other than assembling a great song.</p>
<p><i>Carbon-Based Anatomy</i> might be relatively conventional, but thanks to Masvidal and Reinert's idiosyncratic virtuosity, it doesn't come off as bland. Masvidal shines on the EP's two other core tracks, ""Box Up My Bones"" and ""Elves Beam Out"". On the former-- like the title track, a catchy, profoundly dynamic mini opus-- the guitarist whooshes in during a mid-song breather, playing a gorgeous series of notey trills and demonstrating how he's re-purposed his metal-honed chops in the service of pure textural beauty. In ""Elves Beam Out"", a strange, dazzling little song, he connects the dots between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"" target=""_blank"">John Lennon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4711-yes/"">Yes</a>' Steve Howe, moving from gloomy, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4CzqrPZtXk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Want You (She's So Heavy)""</a>-style riffage to feverishly grandiose filigree. Throughout the release, Reinert deftly balances ornament with groove. On the ""Carbon-Based Anatomy"" verse, he peppers his beat with a flurry of tasty tom and snare accents, while on the ""Elves Beam Out"" chorus, he blends brisk bass-drum stutters and half-time cymbal accents into an infectious stop-start pattern.</p>
<p><i>Carbon-Based Anatomy</i>'s three remaining tracks-- bookends ""Amidst the Goals"" and ""Hieroglyph"", which feature chanting and narration from singer-songwriter Amy Correia, and mid-EP breather ""Bija!""-- set aside chops in favor of atmosphere. (James Cameron's sci-fi-meets-New Age mysticism is an apt reference point for the moods these pieces conjure.) Unlike the songs that sit next to them, this material depends entirely on context. Listen to the release front-to-back, and they function as respectable palate cleansers and thematic signposts; but consider them individually, especially the tablas-and-chanting-heavy ""Bija!,"" and they scan as too mundane, paling next to the ecstatically inventive material that surrounds them. To be fair, Cynic has skirted this line since <i>Focus</i>, which wasn't without its over-the-top moments; there, as with <i>Carbon-Based Anatomy</i>, though, the quality of the surrounding songs is too high for it to matter much.</p>
<p>Lofty as it is, the text Correia speaks in ""Hieroglyph"" resonates strongly with Cynic's creative ambitions. She tells of a soul who's been ""blown to all corners of the universe… his whole being an explosion into infinity."" When she observes, ""No walls/ No specific personality,"" it's hard not to think of Masvidal and Reinert's fearless two-decade-plus quest to evolve, their willingness to cast off metal-oriented trappings that no longer suited their compositional needs. For a band that's come this far, maybe a metaphor involving the transgalactic dispersion of the soul really is appropriate. When you're functioning at as high a level as 2011-model Cynic, you're entitled to a bit of grandiosity.</p></div>"|16034.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16034-carbon-based-anatomy-ep/|7.6|Hank Shteamer

The soul great found beauty within the wreckage, and the album doubled as an emotional exorcism that pushed out pain, anger, regret, spite, vengeance. ""Memories haunt you all the time/ I will never leave your mind,"" he threatens on a song called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ74DQ-HWxQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You""</a>. Reviewing the album upon its release in 1978, critic Robert Christgau wrote, ""<span class=""s1"">Because Gaye's self-involvement is so open and unmediated... it retains unusual documentary charm."" </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">The same could be said of <a href=""http://www.drakeofficial.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>, whose unrepentant navel-gazing and obsession with lost love reach new levels on his second proper LP, <i>Take Care</i>. Running with Gaye's ghost, Drake offers a profane update of his forebear's twisted heart: ""<span class=""s2"">Fuck that nigga that you love so bad/ I know you still think about the times we had,"" he sings on the insidious hook </span>of <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12224-marvins-room/"" target=""_blank"">""Marvins Room""</a>, a song recorded in the same studio where Gaye originally exposed his own unedited thoughts more than three decades ago.</p>
<p class=""p3"">In this age of reality television, 24-hour celebrity news, and second-to-second documentation-- where behind-the-scenes sagas mix with what's on screen and on record, creating an ever-morphing, ever-more-self-aware new normal-- Drake is an apt avatar. Naturally, he knows this, too. ""They take the greats from the past and compare us/ I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era,"" he contemplates on the album, ""In a time where it's recreation/ To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations."" We can thank <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a> for legitimately kicking off this open-book hip-hop era, and it's increasingly apparent that Drake is the most engaging new rap star since Ye. While fame causes some to withdraw and cling to what little privacy they have left, this 25-year-old Canadian's penchant for poetic oversharing has only been emboldened by his success. When he's not making the most epic drunk-dial song in pop history with ""Marvins Room"", he's openly pleading with former flame <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"" target=""_blank"">Rihanna</a> on the record's title track, or duetting with Twitter wife <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj</a> on ""Make Me Proud"" only to call out such publicity-baiting ""relationships"" two tracks later, where he raps, ""It look like we in love, but only on camera."" With its startlingly frank talk and endless heartbreak, <i>Take Care</i> often reads like a string of especially vulnerable-- and sometimes embarrassing-- Missed Connections.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This time around, Drake has a better grasp on his own notoriety and the mind-fucks that come with it. While he expressed wonderfully wounded trepidations about his sudden rise on <i>Thank Me Later</i>, he's learning to embrace it more here. ""They say more money more problems, my nigga, don't believe it,"" he raps on closer ""The Ride"". ""I mean, sure, there's some bills and taxes I'm still evading/ But I blew six million on myself, and I feel amazing."" And on ""HYFR (Hell Ya Fucking Right)"", he all but gives away his hand, turning his sadness into strategy: ""What have I learned since getting richer?/ I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures."" And while he claims ""I think I like who I'm becoming"" on ""Crew Love""-- about as ringing an endorsement you'll get from a guy so bent on exposing his own disappointments-- he's still more interested in contradiction than triumph. Even when staring at a pair of unnatural breasts, he highlights the incision rather than the size: ""Brand new girl and she still growing/ Brand new titties, stitches still showing/ Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good/ I'm 'bout to fuck and I'm just praying that it feels good.""</p>
<p class=""p1""><span>Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up. <i>Thank Me Later</i> banked on a sonic tableau that was slow and sensual and dark-- equal parts <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/10601-aaliyah/"" target=""_blank"">Aaliyah</a> and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"" target=""_blank"">the xx</a>-- and <i>Take Care</i> takes that aesthetic to an even more rewarding place, spearheaded by Drake's go-to producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, who gets a writing and production credit on almost every song. While the bombastic style of producer <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/out-the-trunk/7984-out-the-trunk-5/"" target=""_blank"">Lex Luger's work</a> with <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a> and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"" target=""_blank"">Waka Flocka Flame</a> threatened to turn the tide on Drake and 40's moody atmospherics last summer, the pair stick to their gut here and delve further into smooth piano and muffled drums, fully committed to the idea of doing more with less. This is sensuous music that breathes heavy somewhere between <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/5406-ugk/"" target=""_blank"">UGK</a>'s deep funk, quiet-storm 90s R&amp;B, and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a>-inspired minimalism.

Its subtlety is a direct rebuke to the rash of in-the-red Eurotrance waveforms clogging up radio dials. Even the more upbeat tracks take pains not to rely on a simple thump. ""Take Care"" features Rihanna and a four-four beat, but the singer shows off her little-heard whispering delivery and the instrumental comes courtesy of the xx's </span><span style=""color: #222222;""><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie xx</a></span><span>, who nimbly tailors <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaXslpx3MWY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his remix</a> of <span style=""color: #222222;""><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/28552-gil-scott-heron/"" target=""_blank"">Gil Scott-Heron</a></span>'s ""I'll Take Care of You"" for the occasion.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Drake's worked on his own technical abilities, too, and both his rapping and singing are better than ever here. Notably, he only brandishes the hashtag flow he quickly became famous (or infamous) for over the last few years, turning it into a knowing knock on copycats: ""Man, all of your flows bore me/ Paint drying."" And he breathlessly runs through the opening verse on the vicious ""HYFR"" at a speed that would likely garner respect from <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/514-busta-rhymes/"" target=""_blank"">Busta Rhymes</a>. And then there's ""Doing It Wrong"", a brilliant, barely there slow jam that borrows some lyrics from an unlikely source (Don ""American Pie"" McLean's twangy 1977 track ""The Wrong Thing to Do"") and features an unlikely guest in <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/8316-stevie-wonder/"" target=""_blank"">Stevie Wonder</a>. Fitting the album's classy, unshowy demeanor, Wonder is tapped not to sing but play harmonica-- and uncharacteristically downcast harmonica at that-- for the track's crushing denouement. The song has Drake chronicling the conflicting emotions of a difficult breakup and giving us his finest singing to date. His words are simple, universal, true: ""We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together/ But we sure make it feel like we're together/ 'Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else."" Elsewhere, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/6335-andre-3000/"" target=""_blank"">André 3000</a> references <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/"" target=""_blank"">Adele</a>'s unimpeachable <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12105-someone-like-you/"" target=""_blank"">""Someone Like You""</a> in one of the album's many well-placed guest verses; ""Doing It Wrong"" deserves to follow that song as pop's next Great Heartbroken Ballad.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The cover of <i>Take Care</i> shows its star sitting at a table, dejected and surrounded by gold, like a hip-hop Midas. Considering some of the money-doesn't-buy-you-happiness sentiments inside, the picture is apropos enough. But it's much too obvious to truly represent what Drake and his crew have done here. A better image would be <a href=""http://octobersveryown.blogspot.com/2011/06/marvins-room.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the grainy, amateur photo he released with ""Marvins Room"" when he originally leaked it in June</a>, which shows the rapper walking away from a group of private jets, his face obscured by a puff of smoke making its way up to an overcast sky. It lets his reality do the heavy lifting while Drake stands by, taking it all in.</p></div>"|16039.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16039-take-care/|8.6|Ryan Dombal

This time, however, the circumstances feel simpler: Footwork influences and references are the norm for a whole international world of ""bass music,"" and the questions of exploitation and gimmickry seem to have been put to rest, or at least pushed aside. Good timing, too-- the second <i>Bangs &amp; Works</i> is a marked improvement over its predecessor; as if unconcerned with being comprehensively representative to outsiders, its curator, Mike Paradinas, can delve into the very depths of the sound's weirdness.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that footwork proved so fascinating to so many different sectors of dance music simultaneously was its unforgiving extremity: Sonically rough and rhythmically brutal, it laced together latent impulses from jungle, breakcore, and house into something that sounded like mutant hip-hop-- booty house gone berserk. Compatible with so many universes yet still alien enough to be ineffably hip, it was the outsider of music of 2010 that stubbornly fought its way into the conversation. Hip-hop and R&amp;B samples were the theme of the first <i>Bangs &amp; Works</i>, emphasizing the Chicago scene's connection to and identification with hip-hop culture, but the focus on the second has changed.  Instead of the staccato vocal clipping and syllabic repetition, you're more likely to hear swerving synths or pounding drums on <i>Bangs &amp; Works 2</i>, a document of the scene that emphasizes its house roots.</p>
<p>The first track sets the mood appropriately: RP Boo's ""Heavy Heat"" is a stormer of sub-bass and grim horn stabs, nary a vocal to be found outside of Boo's own producer tag drops (a common sound on <i>Bangs &amp; Works 2</i>).  There are still tracks with vocals-- rapping on DJ Earl's ""Hit Da Bootz"", chipmunk crooning on DJ Solo's ""What Have You Done"", hype-man hypnosis on DJ Roc's ""Get Buck Juice""-- but they're the exceptions.  Instead we get the lush synth-funk of DJ Rashad &amp; Gant-Man's ""Heaven Sent"" or the pendulous insanity of DJ T-Why's ear-piercing ""Finished"".  That same producer's ""Juice"" and tracks from DJ Metro like ""Smak My Bitch Up"" show how dissociative and trippy footwork can be without sacrificing its crucial danceability-- not that it was ever easy to dance to in the first place.</p>
<p>It's two new-- to Mu, anyway-- producers who run with that weirdness, standing out on the compilation's most progressive moments.  Young Smoke provides vivid psychodrama with his string of lush tracks at the compilation's end, like the sparse funk of ""Space Muzik Pt. 3"", not too far from a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29526-pearson-sound/"" target=""_blank"">Pearson Sound</a> production.  But it's Jlin who steals the show early on with ""Erotic Heat"", all tremulous low-frequency throbs, cracking snares, and drum patterns that snake and writhe with unusual precision. So many footwork producers are content to let their tom-toms skate across a slippery surface of undulating sub-bass, but Jlin's are unusually tactile and exact, little miniature cascades unfolding separately at will. Sharing the same Mortal Kombat sample as DJ MC's ""Y Fall"" but utilizing it so much more effectively, Jlin proves what makes her particularly special with the swampy psychedelia of ""Asylum"", harboring some of the hardest and heaviest-hitting percussion of any footwork track released on Planet Mu to date.  Jlin's tracks are captivating because she relocates footwork's focus, rendering those bass rumbles even more isolated as she scatters the percussion to far-flung corners of the stereo spectrum.  Her tracks show not only footwork's room for experimentation but the raw power that shines through even its weirdest moments.</p>
<p>Just like its older brother, <i>Bangs &amp; Works 2</i> is an exhausting listen, 80 minutes of intense syncopation spread over 26 dense nuggets.  But whether it's the generally higher production values this time around or simply a more agreeable palette, the whole thing feels a little easier to swallow.  It's hard not to jump from track to track getting excited with each producer that steps up to the plate, almost enough to override the sometimes slipshod feeling of compilations like these-- and with the newfound thematic coherence, hodgepodge isn't an issue.  Paradinas' library of footwork tracks numbers well over 1,500, and he's done an admirable curatorial job of finding some common threads in a sea of cobbled-together mania.  No longer dealing with the pressure to bring a new sound to the masses, he's instead coaxed out one of its most curious aspects for a disc of strange musical delicacies likely to appeal as much to footwork fanatics as those looking for new avenues for the avant-garde.</p></div>"|16033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16033-bangs-and-works-vol-2/|7.8|Andrew Ryce

This is because a Frog Eyes record often sounds like a Shaksepearean play on amphetamines, pummeling you at a frenzied pace with wordplay, allusions, and vaguely familiar proper nouns. You might also need a stomach for the macabre: Frontman Mercer often shrieks like someone being burnt at the stake, the soundscapes around him melting into a hallucinatory drip.</p>
<p>It's true that Mercer's music is demanding and dense (along with his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5021-swan-lake/"" target=""_blank"">Swan Lake</a> cohorts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7155-spencer-krug/"" target=""_blank"">Spencer Krug</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25875-dan-bejar/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Bejar</a>, he seems perennially intent on treating the album like an epic poem), but there are also plenty of thrills on the surface. Somewhere in the last Frog Eyes album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14172-pauls-tomb-a-triumph/"" target=""_blank"">Paul's Tomb: A Triumph</a></i>, there was a knotty narrative of violence, guilt, and redemption, but-- check the soaring, firecracker riffs on ""Styled By Dr. Roberts"" and ""Lear in Love""-- it was also a hell of a guitar record. (There's even something morbid about his choice of gear: Mercer got the guitar tone on that record by using old, dying amps.)</p>
<p>Similarly, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12607-skin-of-evil/"" target=""_blank"">Skin of Evil</a></i>, the second proper record from his solo project, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/blackoutbeach"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blackout Beach</a>, was full of luxuriant texture. Even the lyrics themselves possessed a phonetic beauty. Who is Donna, the elusive muse who haunted <i>Skin of Evil</i>? An obscure goddess from a test you failed in high school English? No, Mercer's said he just likes the way the name sounds-- it reminds him of ""dawn."" So it is with <i>Fuck Death</i>: a record like any other, best listened to with the search engine browser closed and the encyclopedia left on the shelf. The story's there should you wish to untangle it, but don't let it distract you from the luminous atmosphere and synth experiments whose rewards lie much closer to the surface.</p>
<p>""Did you ever think of yourself as a runaway?"" Mercer murmured on an unusually hushed moment of Frog Eyes' clanging, 2007 opus <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10167-tears-of-the-valedictorian/"" target=""_blank"">Tears of the Valedictorian</a></i>. Throughout his career, he's been preoccupied with themes of masculinity, cowardice, and destiny. How fast must a man run to outpace his own fate? Or, perhaps a better question, one he probably should have asked before he started running: Where can he go? Set during wartime, <i>Fuck Death </i> takes inspiration from soldiers' desertion to probe these dark themes. The pulse of hypnotic opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12368-beautiful-burning-desire/"" target=""_blank"">""Beautiful Burning Desire""</a> beats, ""We got to run away/ Run run away/ Going to run away,"" while the corroding, industrial tones of ""Torchlights Banned"", featuring backing vocals from Frog Eyes keyboardist Megan Boddy, underscore the tenderness and urgency of a letter home: ""I'm going to be a while/ I'm in a fortress of flame/…And your love is all I shall stand for/ And I'm standing in the rain.""</p>
<p>Unlike the more recent, guitar-heavy Frog Eyes records, the sound of <i>Fuck Death</i> mostly comes from intricately layered monophonic synths. In the middle of ""Beautiful Burning Desire"", they take on the ominous quality of air-raid sirens; on ""Torchlights Banned"" they are the commanding chop of helicopter blades; and perhaps most effectively, during the narrator's flight from his camp on ""Be Forewarned, the Night Has Come"", they give the impression of searchlights. On paper it probably seems too literal-- like avant-garde Foley art-- but the tones Mercer employs effectively create an atmosphere of chilly foreboding, and their luminous tones also provide a sonic link to the record's thematic preoccupation with light and darkness. Mercer generally throws so many ideas at you that you're left huffing and puffing with barely a moment to process it all, but <i>Fuck Death</i> is the first record of his that feels like a genuine meditation on the themes it explores. Instead of pummeling, it actually awards the listener with moments of pause, making its atmosphere that much more immersive.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Fuck Death</i> there's also Mercer's requisite musings about art and the artist (""You should be ashamed, Philistine,"" goes one ironic, spittle-filled taunt) on which you can faintly detect him grappling with his own persona-- obstinately refusing to go easy on us, to crack a smile, or to let in some light. It's this monochromatic darkness that ultimately makes it a less compelling record than his pal Bejar's 2011 offering <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/"" target=""_blank"">Kaputt</a></i>, and in particular its closing number, the irresistible, cagily autobiographical, 11-minute-roller-skate-jam-on-quaaludes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11433-bay-of-pigs/"" target=""_blank"">""Bay of Pigs""</a>. ""Bay of Pigs"" is indulgent and artful, but it's also breezy and inviting, the kind of song you'd play for those who have previously dismissed Destroyer as being pretentious or an acquired taste in the hope that it might convert them. There are no such songs on <i>Fuck Death</i>, and so the Mercer camps will remain divided. His admirers will find this record beautiful in the strangest places, while his detractors might choose to see its occasional impenetrable gloom as a kind of desertion in itself: In the end, he's still running from us.</p></div>"|16029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16029-blackout-beach-fuck-death/|7.3|Lindsay Zoladz

Skip forward a year, and we have <i>Pan Am Stories</i>, an album title that's superficially linked to the process of escape, tied into a company that went bankrupt after misjudging the flux in demand to get away from it all. Rangers is a solo project conducted by the San Francisco-based Texas transplant Joe Knight, who put out a flurry of cassette-only releases on <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/asabovesobelowtapes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">As Above So Below</a> and his current label <a href=""http://notnotfun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Not Not Fun</a> toward the end of the last decade. <i>Suburban Tours </i>was a surprisingly concise effort after the freeform sprawl of those releases, but the central Rangers sound-- dense layers of fudgy guitar melancholia engulfed by acres of tape dust-- remained intact.</p>
<p>On <i>Pan Am Stories</i>, Knight attempts to build a better link between his past and present selves, retaining some of the expansiveness of earlier Rangers releases and stacking them up against exercises in cropped lo-fi pop. It's a double album, with many tracks stretching well over the four-minute mark, and a focal point in ""Zeke's Dream"" that runs to 13-and-a-half minutes. That song, like most of the others here, is marked by a strangulated guitar tone reminiscent of the heavily processed work Jonathan Donahue and Grasshopper were dabbling in on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2741-mercury-rev/"">Mercury Rev</a>'s <i>Yerself Is Steam</i>. Like that band, Knight appears obsessively occupied with severing open altered states of consciousness through his music. ""Zeke's Dream"" feels like several different songs all pushing one another out of the picture, with the feverish playing cascading through basic riffing, rippling solos, and even some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>-like keyboard drones.</p>
<p>It's no surprise, then, that a search for Rangers throws up a <a href=""http://butterxface.blogspot.com/2009/09/rangers-low-cuts-faded.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">story</a> of people tripping balls to the ever-unfolding <i>Low Cut Fades</i> cassette while driving through the desert. That tale seems particularly appropriate when you consider Knight's fascination with travel, where the mode of getting somewhere appears more attractive than the final destination. In a sense, that's how Rangers' most expansive music plays out too. ""The Mule"", at the back end of this album, is a loosely woven ballad that ebbs and flows as keyboard noise and fat guitar excess is worked in. Despite those elements, it never deviates from its central riff, which coils over and over, locked down in a journey with no particular goal in mind. Even at its most tuneful, on tracks like the poppy and more tightly structured ""Luncheon Ghana"", there's a sense that these songs are fragments of works that could easily be pushed out into ""Zeke's Dream""-sized spaces.</p>
<p>What makes <i>Pan Am Stories</i> worth returning to is the scope Knight works within, where elements of prog, folk, and psychedelia blur in and out of focus, often mirroring the superior work Bristol explorers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1524-flying-saucer-attack/"">Flying Saucer Attack</a> were practicing in the 1990s. At times it does lag, especially when the buried-in-the-sand vocal exercises on tracks like ""Khyber Pass"" and ""Sacred Cows"" don't add much to the overall picture. But it feels like Knight is finding his confidence as a singer here, perhaps prepping to step out of the dimly lit corner he was sporadically crooning into during the making of this record. In particular, the twinned ""Zombies (Day)"" and ""Zombies (Night)"" are among his most fully formed pop efforts yet, indicating that his music can be as much about design and execution as it is about voyage and discovery.</p></div>"|16028.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16028-pan-am-stories/|6.2|Nick Neyland

According to the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, Whitehead-- a specialist in colorful and morbid depictions of demons and reapers-- was working as a guest at Taylor Street Tattoo following an international inking tour. After midnight, he got in a fight with his girlfriend and, as a<i> Tribune</i> reporter wrote, allegedly ""used the tools of his trade to sexually assault his girlfriend after he slammed her head against a floor and choked her."" Whitehead posted bail and, 10 months later, has yet to go to trial.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, Whitehead, under the name Wrest, has been pressing the bounds of black metal, adding psychedelic textures and hints of mid-tempo punk to fairly brutal marathons. By himself as <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/leviathanx666x"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leviathan</a> and the great <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5779-lurker-of-chalice/"" target=""_blank"">Lurker of Chalice</a>, and with the misfiring supergroup Twilight, Whitehead made weird, unexpected moves within United States Black Metal long before the form broke into indie rock circles or <i>The New Yorker</i>'s pages. He's long been heavy on horror and violence, too, with song titles like ""A Bouquet of Blood for Skull"", ""I Miss Watching You Die"" and, notably, ""The History of Rape"". He often wrote and spoke of suicide and, in 2004, <a href=""http://www.metalcrypt.com/pages/interviews.php?intid=136"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told an interviewer</a> that being alive at least allowed him ""to voice anti-human disgust."" Still, his arrest was surprising and a big deal; for the last 10 months, questions about him have become boilerplate in extreme metal interviews.</p>
<p>The inevitable summary of Whitehead's January arrest isn't meant to romanticize the actions of the occasionally violent black metal scene, or to give him the Burzum-sized brand of black metal authenticity. It's not meant to scorn Whitehead, either, as he has yet to be convicted of anything. Rather, as Whitehead admitted in a rare interview with Pitchfork's Brandon Stosuy in September, the incident and subsequent fallout served as the inspiration for his most recent album, the unashamedly titled <i>True Traitor, True Whore</i>. ""The true harlot has been revealed,” Whitehead wrote in the email interview. ""[<i>True Traitor, True Whore</i>] is most definitely an expression of what I've been thru in the past year... Everyone's met one by now, I'd imagine-- not too cryptic.""</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding dismissive,<i> True Traitor, True Whore</i> sounds like the work of a one-time innovator who's since been preoccupied. Sure, as on with almost all Whitehead releases, the multi-instrumentalist starts from a rigorous base of black metal and floods that sound with extrinsic influences. ""True Whorror"" sprints with a near-grindcore jolt, while ""Shed This Skin"" intersperses black-metal blurs with moments of funeral doom and glimpses of thrash heroics. On ""Harlot Rises"", an acoustic-guitar breakdown clashes with sound effects that mimic industrial 1980s drums. There are drones and noise, post-rock climbs, and smoldering comedowns, too. But <i>True Traitor</i> often circles back or collapses on itself, with many of these eight songs eventually devolving at various points into messy psychedelic maelstroms that, compositionally, Whitehead doesn't seem good enough to redirect. On ""Contrary Pulse"", he builds tension by slowing the song's tempo, allowing its more aggressive elements to claw against its dirge-like undercarriage. It's an intriguing setup, but he never capitalizes on that unease, eventually letting the song escape into a web of meandering guitar. What starts with a roar ends, then, with an unsatisfying whimper. Leviathan's best work has been about pushing momentum from one extreme to another; on <i>True Traitor</i>, that sense of movement is generally squandered, as Whitehead struggles and frequently fails to make his many strains of interest cohere.</p>
<p>What's more, for a sub-genre that's not only itself full of interesting ideas but that's also recently spawned compelling sounds in other niches, <i>True Traitor</i> feels redundant. Leviathan has done brutal black metal better than this (see 2006's too-brief <i>The Blind Wound</i>), and he's previously been much more convincing when tying that ferocity to outside sounds (see 2008's great <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11682-massive-conspiracy-against-all-lifelurker-of-chalice/"" target=""_blank"">Massive Conspiracy Against All Life</a></i>). At various points here, Whitehead sounds like a less developed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28801-locrain/"" target=""_blank"">Locrian</a>, a smaller <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4783-wolves-in-the-throne-room/"" target=""_blank"">Wolves in the Throne Room</a> or a less intricate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27824-absu/"" target=""_blank"">Absu</a>. Thematically, <i>True Traitor, True Whore</i> is a work of pure juvenilia, comprised of songs with puns for titles that would be more understandable coming from the pen of a pimply 13-year-old boy aggravated by the rage of puberty. There's opener ""True Whorror"", the chaser ""Her Circle Is the Noose"", and the mid-album ""Every Orifice Yawning Her Price"". Not only are those titles ripe for parody (and prosecutors), but they're also repetitive, another symptom of the unimaginative core at work throughout<i> Traitor</i>. Leviathan's 2004 album, <i>Tentacles of Whorror</i>, already cashed in on a lot of these jokes; it was a much better album, too.</p>
<p>Since January, some critics and listeners have advocated for a <i>yimakh shemo</i> approach to Whitehead, meaning that-- if the charges against him are true-- his work should be ignored, his musical legacy ruined by the deplorable thing he might have done. Without Wrest, though, it's impossible to imagine black metal's current stateside currency or creativity. He's made some remarkable records that have rightfully had a widespread effect on many of the bands that followed him. <i>True Traitor, True Whore</i> isn't ultimately dismissible because of what Whitehead allegedly did in January; rather, it is dismissible because it does not improve what he certainly did for the decade-plus prior, which was to help map new territory in a field that has since raced forward independently-- and ahead, it seems-- of him.</p></div>"|16035.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16035-true-traitor-true-whore/|6.0|Grayson Currin

""Hazy"" (rhymes with ""lazy"") is right up there for me, but another that makes me wince though I've used it myself dozens of times over the years  is ""cinematic."" It's the term we reach for with instrumental music because movies are where we first learned about the emotional impact of abstract sound. If we'd have grown up in the silent era, we'd be leaning on different adjectives, but given our level of ""moving image + instrumental music"" saturation, ""cinematic"" is what comes to mind. Fair enough. In the past, the music of <a href=""http://pointnever.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>-- the main project of the busy producer Daniel Lopatin, also of 1980s pop revivalists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"" target=""_blank"">Ford &amp; Lopatin</a>-- fit this term. Albums like the <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13896-rifts/"" target=""_blank"">Rifts</a></i> collection and 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14326-returnal/"" target=""_blank"">Returnal</a></i> had drones and moods and thematic shifts that hinted at some kind of on-screen drama. And Lopatin has said that he's been influenced by film music and would love to work on movie scores. But the new OPN album, <i>Replica</i>, which also happens to be Lopatin's best work to date by far, is coming from somewhere else. This is music that exists independently, each track a tiny universe with its own cracked logic.</p>
<p>A few people have mentioned <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/425-the-books/"" target=""_blank"">the Books</a> to me in reference to this album, and the comparison holds water. It's not that <i>Replica </i>sounds anything like the Books-- though it uses tight loops of sampled voices, the voices exist to convey texture rather than language-- but Lopatin shares with them a fresh ear that creates an uncanny sense of wonder in the music. Also like the Books, <i>Replica</i> puts a premium on silence; just as important as all the odd, hard-to-place sounds is the space that frames it. And the combination of unusual textures and all the room, plus the way the music seems unbound to any particular era or aesthetic, makes the whole thing feel playful. The music is by turns dark, ethereal, frightening, and silly, but regardless, it carries in it a feeling of joy. There's a real sense of <i>discovery</i> here, or possibilities being probed, and that feeling is infectious. You can hear the person making it getting deep into what these sonic elements could mean, and he's bringing us down into this fantastic place with him.</p>
<p>Aside from the intricate production detail, what's most striking about <i>Replica</i> is how well-constructed these tracks are, which is especially impressive given the record's brevity (the first nine average less than four minutes each). Each has an arc and the music is constantly changing, but the tracks go into unexpected places. The opening ""Andro"" starts with a lonely, distant synth tone and fuzzy layers of robo-voices before becoming overtaken by noisy samples and, eventually, an explosion of percussion from what sounds like a a digital jungle. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12350-sleep-dealer/"" target=""_blank"">""Sleep Dealer""</a> starts off like a pop version of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Reich</a> tape piece, zeroing in on percussive phonetic ticks and a loop of a human sigh, but it gradually resolves itself in an almost geometric way, as the relationship between the various samples snaps into focus just before the ending. The title track pulls us out of the machine by starting with a simple piano figure and then folding in bits of synth and finally a buzzing drone, becoming something alien and foreboding after starting so warm and melancholy. Lopatin doesn't just introduce sounds, add loops, and fade out; his pieces <i>move</i>, tripping from one place to somewhere far away over the course of just a few minutes.</p>
<p>A couple of tracks, like ""Submersible"" and ""Remember"", come closer to the pure synth drone work that marked earlier OPN material, but even these are full of weird surprises, like the distorted and warbly vocal loop at the tail end of ""Remember"" that manages to sound like a field recording of some ancient religious rite, even though it's probably something like a processed syllable taken from a life insurance advertisement. ""Remember"", like the album as a whole, feels peculiar and just out of reach, and it makes me realize how hard it is these days to find music imbued with genuine mystery. A huge part of the fun with this record is that these sonic miniatures are truly puzzling even as they remain accessible and highly musical; <i>Replica</i> is ""experimental"" music that also feels open, and somehow, despite coming out of two speakers like all my other records, it manages to feel participatory. I can feel myself filling in space and making connections as I listen.</p>
<p>Most film music is functional and is meant to reinforce images and amplify what's happening in the story. It is manipulative by design, serving to bend the affect of the viewer in accordance with the director's wishes. These 10 tracks are packed with detail and rich with feeling, but they are also, to a strange degree, devoid of manipulation. Even though they're uniformly stirring, they don't point you in any direction in particular, and you could see each listener creating his or her own meaning. Instead of pushing, they serve mostly to draw you closer and remind you of the power of sound <i>as</i> sound. Lopatin may have used <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/take-cover/8705-oneohtrix-point-never-replica/"" target=""_blank"">samples from 1980s commercials</a> to create many of these tracks, but <i>Replica</i> doesn't use nostalgia as an end in itself. This is music that digs deeper and burrows beneath the level of shared associations to discover the sparkling emotional potential of carefully arranged vibrations moving through the air.</p></div>"|16031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16031-replica/|8.8|Mark Richardson

Generational divides can often make the things young people do seem kind of alien, and the riots-- with no spokesperson and no manifesto-- were difficult for some people to comprehend. At just 17 Archy Marshall, aka <a href=""http://www.kingkrule.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">King Krule</a>, belongs to that frustrated section of the populace, and although he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8696-king-krule/"">told Pitchfork recently</a> that he didn't riot himself, he understood why others did.</p>
<p>His debut EP might not be overtly political lyrically, but there's a wellspring of tension and bleakness running through the record that taps into those feelings of discontent that hung in the air this summer. Often the tension in Marshall's songs is restless and unresolved. ""Lead Existence"", for example, builds for just a minute before snapping shut on the line ""I lost the soul to my blues, a long time ago""-- in itself a pretty haunting line for somebody so young.</p>
<p>Then there's his voice, which doesn't seem like it should come from a figure so slight-- it's at turns gruff, deep and often cracked. There are shades of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"" target=""_blank"">Leonard Cohen</a> in that delivery and a similar drawl at times to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxW5yvpeHg4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Billy Bragg</a> (who himself championed Marshall back when he was going under <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29366-zoo-kid/"" target=""_blank"">Zoo Kid</a>). It's an expressive voice, changing and morphing with the mood of the songs. On ""Bleak Bake"" Marshall sounds more laidback over a canvas of dubby keys, 808 drums, and deep bass. That calm delivery makes the violence in the lines, ""My heart got hold of my head and ripped it to its seams,"" and, ""Now I'm covered in blood on the bed/ And its a familiar scene,"" seem all the more chilling.</p>
<p>While most of Marshall's lyrics can be bleak or even violent, the instrumentation almost always strikes a warm contrast. There's beauty in the clean, echoing guitars that are all over <i>King Krule</i> and some unexpected moments too-- the jazzy stand-up bass on ""363N63"" or the string hits in ""Bleak Bake"", for example. These textures and sounds lend a redemptive, hopeful quality to the music.</p>
<p>EP highlight and closer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12524-the-noose-of-jah-city/"" target=""_blank"">""The Noose of Jah City""</a> is the most complete and focused song on the record. It pivots on an echoing guitar line and sparkling keyboards as Marshall's vocal, enveloped in reverb, spills across that background. In the verses he sounds poised, imagining his own death, stoically predicting, ""My body found, but my soul was left to drown/ Suffocated in concrete."" Marshall's anxiety about his mind and soul is a recurring motif throughout the EP and, like the beauty in some of the instrumentation, makes for a detached, almost mystical contrast to the kitchen-sink vibe of the rest of the drama.</p>
<p>There's a documentary realism to much of these recordings, from Marshall's cough at the start of ""Bleak Bake"", to his spoken introduction to ""The Noose of Jah City"". Those moments make you feel like a voyeur sneaking a listen to a work in progress. If there's one flaw, it's that <i>King Krule</i> does seem quite slight in its brevity, and ideas are often left to hang in the air rather than chased to their conclusion. But the record also feels like an important moment in time marked on a door frame-- it's an intriguing peek into the restless, youthful development of King Krule.</p></div>"|16011.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16011-king-krule/|8.0|Hari Ashurst

The New York garage/house/whatever producer dropped his second album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15243-you-stand-uncertain/"" target=""_blank"">You Stand Uncertain</a></i>, to much acclaim. With the arrival of the four-track <i>Atlantis</i> EP on Ninja Tune, he has also released several EPs/singles of material frequently more vibrant than that which graced the album. (The best of these, <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/ramprecordings/sets/ramp042-faltydl-hip-love-jamie-xx-remix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hip Love""</a>, received a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie xx</a> remix and stands as Lustman's finest track to date, as well as one of Jamie's finest re-works.) Always difficult to pin down, <i>Atlantis</i> proves Lustman hasn't run out of tricks; on a track-to-track basis, it's his most eclectic, challenging release, jumping nimbly between styles, tempos, and moods over the course of each song.</p>
<p><i>Atlantis</i> serves as a showcase for its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12718-atlantis/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>, a five-minute bruiser that is equal parts menacing and optimistic. Built on a powerful, pulsing bass progression, Lustman slips in garage's trademark syncopated percussion; the effect is like hearing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>'s streamlined <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11612-love-cry/"" target=""_blank"">""Love Cry""</a> mischievously tweaked then pushed into the red. When the drums momentarily collect and simplify themselves, they act as a release valve for the bass' budding steam. Lustman might have had an anthem but instead chose nervy, sustained energy, and it seems wilier as a result.</p>
<p>The remainder of <i>Atlantis</i> is more scattered but no less enjoyable. ""Can't Stop the Prophet"", in particular, feels like a breakthrough: sharp orchestral samples rub against detuned snippets of a dusty torch song, creating enough friction for the drums to slip into 180bpm drum'n'bass. The sampledelic joy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25477-the-avalanches/"" target=""_blank"">the Avalanches</a> mingles with bass music's natural paranoia and the result is bliss-y, idiosyncratic mindrock. The final two songs, ""My Light, My Love"" and ""The Sale Ends"", hew closer to Lustman's trad garage work, but they're more variant in tone and structure than much of <i>You Stand Uncertain</i>, employing ringing laser blasts and croaking anti-divas.</p>
<p><i>Atlantis</i> is the most manic, undecided release for Lustman to date. Shiftiness can be a curse in dace music-- a realm that often asks its tracks to play nice with others-- but he changes gears frequently in the name of contrast and genuine surprise. Lustman, whom I enjoy more with each subsequent release, already stands as one of the most productive and reliable American dance producers. At the rate he's been putting out music, it may not be long before he removes those qualifiers.</p></div>"|16020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16020-atlantis/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

Every note on <i>Empros</i> is its right place, every surface scraped-up just so; a recent <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Decibel</span> writeup found bassist Brian Cook claiming he'd never make another record ""from the ground up"" like the meticulously constructed <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Empros</span>. Shame, that; as on 2009's swarmed-with-strings <span style=""font-style: italic;""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13607-geneva/"" target=""_blank"">Geneva</a></span>, the expanse charted by the grandiose <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Empros</span> is very vast indeed.</p>
<p>Building on the strides they made on <i>Geneva</i>'s adventurous first half, Russian Circles complicate the drift-and-build of most post-rock, injecting craggy climaxes, letting the low end take the lead. Highlight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12554-mladek/"" target=""_blank"">""Mlàdek""</a> finds a rousing, almost <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/475-broken-social-scene/"" target=""_blank"">Broken Social Scene</a>-style guitar chug careening headlong into a patch of black metal-inspired ballast; the shift in tone's a bit jarring, but considering the disparity of styles at play, the transition's pretty flawless. <i>Empros</i>' best moments-- the snowdrift strings that blow across the end of ""Schiphol"" and into ""Atackla"", the patch cord static and drums that open ""Batu,"" the aforementioned ""Mlàdek"" assault-- find some little sliver of gorgeousness overwhelmed by some orbit-upsetting rumble from Cook or some out-from-nowhere turnaround from drummer Dave Turncrantz.</p>
<p>Complexity for its own sake muddled the Circles' first few LPs a bit; <i>Empros</i>, like <i>Geneva</i> before it, is less prone to wriggle, more likely to lunge, each move bigger than its last. That increased compositional confidence gives each move they make that much more heft, songs charging eagerly towards their second acts, then dizzyingly doubling back. Still, with most of these tunes hinging around some staggeringly huge mid-song wallop, once you've traveled <i>Empros</i>' strangeways a few times, you'll start to see the landmarks coming from a few miles off.</p>
<p>Bigger, stranger, and just plain heavier than any Circles disc before it, the first 35 minutes of <i>Empros</i>' empyrean, oblong alien-prog finds the band once again wrestling their grand ambitions into impossible shapes. And then there's ""Praise Be Man"", a searching, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"" target=""_blank"">Spiritualized</a>-nodding folk-gospel featuring a rare vocal turn from Cook. On a record with less scope than <i>Empros</i>, ""Praise"" would prove the sorest of thumbs, an out-of-character overreach from a band who oughta stick with what they're good at. Arriving at end of all that interstellar overdrive, ""Praise"" proves an especially lovely comedown, one last burst of light to offset all that darkness.</p></div>"|16009.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16009-empros/|7.7|Paul Thompson

The way he uses filters and closely clipped loops has the effect of a pleasantly smudged watercolor painting (much like those he designs himself), vague hints of otherwise implacable sounds rotating and repeating in a whimsical way. It's eminently accessible music, full of tiny ""eureka"" moments of subtle bliss, deft touches, and minuscule finishes so that even a two-minute sketch could feel like a whole world waiting to be dissected. Alas, it's probably that part of his sound that most works <i>against</i> Teebs: His debut album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14798-ardour/"" target=""_blank"">Ardour</a></i>, was probably one of the most pleasant things released from this particular sector last year, but it was easy for track after track of dense nature-scapes to blur together and to lose sight of Teebs' own fascinating personality in the grand scheme of faceless beauty.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for that was <i>Ardour</i>'s length-- at 18 tracks long, it was a hard album to digest without fatigue or boredom setting in, a record that could easily start to feel like style over substance. Whether it's a wise lesson learned or merely serendipity, Mandowa's quick successor is a 10-track, 30-minute affair and all the stronger for it. <i>Collections 01</i>, if you want to be nerdy about it, sits somewhere between an EP and a ""mini-album,"" but a surprisingly cohesive statement like this exists outside the need for nit-picky classification. Teebs himself describes <i>Collections 01</i> as ""a side project or group of mine that just so happened to make the same exact music as I'm making now,"" and as bizarre a description as that is, given that the record features Rebekah Raff's harp and Brainfeeder-associated composer Austin Peralta, maybe it's justified.</p>
<p>While the music on <i>Collections</i> is very identifiably Teebs, it's not merely 10 more tracks of <i>Ardour</i>. Whether it's the presence of collaborators with discrete roles, maturity, or merely a different headspace, the tracks here feel grounded and focused, with more to hold onto even at their most weightless.  The colorful, soft-focus smear is partly replaced with discrete space and  Take ""LSP"", with Peralta, a track that incorporates the same kind of meandering chimes and aquatic nature sounds as so many tracks on <i>Ardour,</i> but now it feels like every element has newfound purpose. On this record, dulcet keyboards paint silky melodies like brushstrokes, the drearily rustling beats are sewn into the fabric rather than tacked on, and tracks have real beginnings and endings rather than just floating by. Texturally, it's some of Mandowa's most gripping material yet, like the simultaneously slamming yet impossibly airy ""Pretty Polly"" or the queasily determined sub-basslines on closing duo ""Red Curbs Loop"" and ""Yellow More New"".</p>
<p>It says something for the fleeting nature of Teebs' music that what, for most artists, would be a stop-gap release turns out to be an arresting career highlight. It might be a slight little package, but somehow it makes even more of an impact than its considerably larger sibling. Attractively structured, confident, and executed without the stoned daydreaming that defined <i>Ardour</i>, <i>Collections</i> marks a new high-water mark for a producer that was already eminently accessible. Even for those who aren't fans of the kind of rambling and tangential ADD music usually proffered by Brainfeeder, the little readjustment on <i>Collections</i> might be just enough to rope in former skeptics. Either way, his new record is another collection of effortlessly gorgeous ruminations on hip-hop expressed through thermal updrafts, babbling brooks, and cracking twigs: This time it just sounds like he knows his way around the forest a little better.</p></div>"|16016.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16016-collections-01/|7.0|Andrew Ryce

The cheddar bred $3,000,000 worth of jealousy after the 23-year old New York rapper disclosed the value of his deal with Sony/RCA last month. The offer was tendered largely off the strength of his first two videos, ""Purple Swag"" and ""Peso"", a pair of codeine fever dreams that recast Harlem World as a slick-talking color-corrected suburb of Houston.</p>
<p>To cool-hunting 360-wielding record executives, the videos might as well have been advertisements for the A$AP lifestyle: Colt 45, purple weed and purple drank, dice games, bike riding, brandishing Berettas, clothing designers ostensibly known only to Kanye, and a pretty blonde girl in a grill mouthing the phrase: ""this is for my niggas getting high on the regular."" Picture an episode of ""Gossip Girl"" where Blake Lively watches <i>Traffic</i> and subsequently opts to explore the Danger Zone of 125th and Lennox.</p>
<p>Unavoidable in the conversation is the enduring absence of a New York commercial force under 30. Since the emergence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1260-dipset/"" target=""_blank"">Dipset</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10616-g-unit/"" target=""_blank"">G-Unit</a> in the first half of the last decade, NYC rap aspirants have largely fallen into four categories: ringtone wunderkinds (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwyE3WJ4AWo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This Is Why I'm Hot""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFav9P54JUA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chicken Noodle Soup""</a>), technically skilled personality voids (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8996-papoose/"" target=""_blank"">Papoose</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10690-saigon/"" target=""_blank"">Saigon</a>), artful traditionalists (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29234-roc-marciano/"" target=""_blank"">Roc Marciano</a>, Ka), and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10782-maino/"" target=""_blank"">Maino</a>.</p>
<p>By contrast, Rocky was telegenic and chanting swag. His lead singles poured syrup-slow Houston ride music atop the malt liquor melodies of Harlem's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29628-max-b/"" target=""_blank"">Max B</a>. What Rocky lacked in lyricism, he made up for in narcotic charisma. Seeking street-cred, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> announced plans to take Rocky on tour. Seeking swag-cred, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10940-lloyd-banks/"" target=""_blank"">Lloyd Banks</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6653-jim-jones/"" target=""_blank"">Jim Jones</a> hopped on tracks with him. Hype metastasizes fastest in New York, and it's easy to conflate the need for a standard bearer with the desire for a savior. Rocky was the chosen one. Hence, $3,000,000.</p>
<p>Commence the hating. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29238-odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29241-hodgy-beats/"" target=""_blank"">Hodgy Beats</a> called him ""A$AP Copy."" Old heads looked askance at his appropriation of styles alien to the five boroughs. Blogs painted it as the worst New York investment since the Yankees gave Brien Taylor $1.55 million. Rocky didn't help matters when he allegedly punched out a soundman at the Fader Fort and announced that he and his whole crew had adopted vegetarianism. Thus, every mention of his debut mixtape, <i>LIVELOVEA$AP </i>has pondered whether it justifies the price tag of a Bugatti and several dozen ivory backscratchers. Good isn't enough. People expect Rakim Mayers to be the second coming of his namesake.</p>
<p>Of course, the odds are slanted in your favor when you're a rapper named Rakim. You can't exactly sell life insurance. And throughout <i>LIVELOVEA$AP</i>, Rocky embodies the sweat-free cool of someone who has stolen the test and memorized the answers ahead of time. It sidesteps the usual pitfalls of the heavily anticipated debut; there are no ill-fitting famous rapper cameos or last-cup leftovers from $10,000-a-beat producers. Rocky makes no cornball radio plays, nor any awkward attempts to prove his depth.  Even on ""Demons"", the record's most emotionally raw track, Rocky is preternaturally self-assured. He's got stomach pains but dreams with the inevitable triumphalism of someone who can convince RCA/Polo Grounds to hand over their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10892-pitbull/"" target=""_blank"">Pitbull</a> blood money. After about a minute of complaining, he's back to ""fucking the chick you're next to."" By rough estimate, Rocky fucks about 13 or 14 different girlfriends in the course of the album's 56 minutes. There are two different mentions of Naughty by Nature's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgFU3U4X_Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""O.P.P.""</a>. He is nothing if not efficient.</p>
<p>That's the thing. It's pretty easy to point out the pitfalls of <i>LIVELOVEA$AP</i>. Thematic and lyrical concerns are basically limited to Rocky being a pretty motherfucker, repping Harlem, doing drugs, and getting more women than James Worthy in Houston.  Rocky raps effortlessly, switching back and forth between Midwestern double-time to something that resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"" target=""_blank"">Wiz Khalifa</a> auditioning for Byrd Gang. The dark, drugged visions of Memphis rap also creep in throughout. But to his credit, he doesn't waste much time persecuting haters, preemptively striking only once on ""Leaf"": ""They say I sound like André/ Mixed with Kanye/ A little bit of Max/ A little bit of Wiz/ A little bit of that/ A little bit of this/ Get off my dick.""</p>
<p>It's more difficult to point out where exactly Rocky excels. He's a good rapper, but he's not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>. He's melodic, but he's not a walking hook like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1482-50-cent/"" target=""_blank"">50 Cent</a>.  His voice is strong but not completely singular. Instead, Rocky has great instincts: the moment when he abruptly switches to his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13390-bone-thugs-n-harmony/"" target=""_blank"">Bone Thugs-N-Harmony</a> flow for a few bars in ""Trilla"", the bizarre song structure of ""Bass"", where he just repeats ""Bass"" in lieu of a hook; the last minute and a half of ""Demons"", where his scrambled lo-fi refrain fades into the chlorine fog of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> beat.</p>
<p>If anything <i>LIVELOVEA$AP</i> is a triumph of immaculate taste. Rocky's ear for beats is worthy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a> or early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1840-the-game/"" target=""_blank"">Game</a>. Courtesy of Clams Casino, Burn One, Beautiful Lou, A$AP Ty Beats, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29688-spaceghostpurrp/"" target=""_blank"">SpaceGhostpurrp</a>, the stellar production makes this something like a swag-rap generation <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3663-the-documentary/"" target=""_blank"">The Documentary</a></i>. He cherry-picks from the best of internet micro-trends-- taking celestial based weirdness, the funk of country rap, the stoned pace of screw, and the tape-warp of Memphis. But at the core is the French-braided, gold-toothed kid from money-making Manhattan, inflecting his songs with hints of third-generation Spanish Harlem and West Indian patois. For someone who brags, ""the only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror,"" Rocky wisely cedes the spotlight to well-chosen guests, including Oakland's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29865-main-attrakionz/"" target=""_blank"">Main Attrakionz</a>, Houstoner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29528-fat-tony/"" target=""_blank"">Fat Tony</a>, and the larcenous intensity of L.A.'s Schoolboy Q. Meanwhile his A$AP crew shows few signs of being there for reasons of nepotism or weed carrying.</p>
<p>""Houston Old Head"" might be the best sign that Rocky can deliver on his seven-figure potential. It's not necessarily the most memorable song, but it's his most surprising-- a swaggering lean-sipping version of Neil Young's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW1l6hS0OPc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Old Man""</a>, with it's chorus, ""If you listen when your old head talk/ You'll be straight."" It's basically the opposite of Odd Future's youth worship-- the admission that occasionally your elders can put you up on game. It shows he's willing to listen and soak up different styles and sounds-- crucial elements for evolution. Even if the fusion initially seems unorthodox, <i>LIVELOVEA$AP</i> is exactly the sort of record you'd expect to hear in 2011 from a New Yorker who was 13 when <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgoqrgc_0cM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Big Pimpin'""</a> came out. Rocky did what should've been expected of him; he made a very good record. Now we wait to see if he'll get clientele.</p></div>"|16026.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16026-liveloveaap/|8.2|Jeff Weiss

But for the duo of Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema, the word ""garage"" didn't so much represent a dirty-D.I.Y. aesthetic as a messy, greasy place where things get stripped down, torn apart, and welded back together. Throughout their 12-year run (from 1988 to 2000), Royal Trux took a chop-shop approach to pop history, deconstructing their favorite FM-radio icons-- in particular, Mick Taylor-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"" target=""_blank"">Rolling Stones</a>-- and reassembling the scrap metal and wires into heaving junkyard jalopies, with the hoarse-voiced but imposingly beautiful Herrema serving as the hood ornament who could sell their mutant custom jobs as classic rock.</p>
<p>Given their amorphous aesthetic-- which yielded works as incongruous as 1990's byzantine bricolage <i>Twin Infinitives</i>, 1995's biker-bar boogie-fest <i>Thank You</i>, and 2000's ghetto-blasted breakdance-athon <i>Radio Video</i> EP-- there is no truly definitive Royal Trux album, a fact reflected by the band's myriad contemporary admirers, who range from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7862-bradford-cox/"" target=""_blank"">Bradford Cox</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"" target=""_blank"">Liars</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2288-the-kills/"" target=""_blank"">the Kills</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/"" target=""_blank"">Bat for Lashes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"" target=""_blank"">Hot Chip</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"" target=""_blank"">MGMT</a>. As a 3xLP collection of the band's early-90s ephemera, <i>Singles, Live, Unreleased</i> may not seem like the most logical entry point into the Trux's phantasmagoric universe. But for newcomers, it's the stand-alone release that provides the best big-picture perspective of Royal Trux's see-saw relationship with rock music and the avant-garde.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1997 (and now reissued in unchanged form), <i>Singles, Live, Unreleased </i>was more than just a stop-gap measure between albums; it also represented a symbolic homecoming to Drag City after a brief stint on Virgin that constituted one of the more bizarre byproducts of the post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a> major-label signing blitz. After <i>Thank You</i> and 1997's <i>Sweet Sixteen</i> failed to realize Virgin's dreams of turning Royal Trux into the next Black Crowes (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Sixteen_(Royal_Trux_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the puke-stained album covers</a> probably didn't help), <i>Singles, Live, Unreleased</i> heralded the band's eventual return to the weird with 1998's fuzzed-out triumph <i>Accelerator</i>. Its chronology-- covering the years of 1988 to 1995-- roughly aligns with the period when Hagerty and Herrema were in the throes of an infamous heroin habit that effectively defined the band in its early years and provided an unavoidable lens through which to interpret its music. But as far as junkies go, they were highly functional-- on top of the four official albums released over that span, the band recorded several non-album singles, compilation tracks, and Peel Sessions. (Of the 32 songs collected here, only five appear-- in different form-- on Trux albums proper.) And just as the duo was struggling to get sober over this period, its music was also undergoing its own slow, difficult lurch toward trad-rock accessibility.</p>
<p>Going one step further than Hagerty's <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/05/the-other-exile-on-main-st-celebrating-pussy-galores-1986-cover-version-.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rolling Stones desecrations in Pussy Galore</a>, Royal Trux's initial singles sound like all the individual recording tracks from <i>Exile on Main Street </i>spliced up and reassembled at random. Songs like ""No Fixed Address"" and ""Hero/Zero"" possess discernible raunch-rock riffs, vocal hooks, and rhythms, but they sound like they each belong in different songs; at the same time, the duo's use of drum machines and weird synth frequencies-- not to mention Hagerty's Hendrixian facility at pushing standard blues-rock scales and solos into lobotomizing squalls-- lend this primitive music an oddly futuristic, temporally dislocating quality. In the same spirit, <i>Singles, Live, Unreleased</i> negates any kind of linear reading of Royal Trux's evolution, favoring instead jarring juxtapositions of era, musical style, and recording quality. But now, with the band defunct for over a decade, this illogical approach makes a lot more sense today than it did in 1997, transforming the listening experience into an archaeological mission, as each excavated track provides another clue to decoding this strange band. Royal Trux's music may not always make sense to you, but even at its  most-messed up, you can still hear how it made sense to them.</p>
<p>The more straightforward rockers here (""Steal Your Face"", ""Gett Off"") aren't quite on the level of the ones heard on 1992's self-titled effort and 1993's <i>Cats &amp; Dogs</i>, while the glaring omission of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSc_8HPgU7U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Delta 70 of Hearts""</a>-- a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ8MvnEVCqM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Can't You Hear Me Knocking""</a> to call their own-- from the 1994 <i>Hey Drag City</i> compilation still confounds. But <i>Singles, Live, Unreleased</i> reveals intriguing new sides of the band that were lamentably never explored on their official albums, like the sampledelic pimp-funk of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW4XNzPDO6A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shockwave Rider""</a> and the blissed-out proto-chillwave of essential '93 Sub Pop single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl4XkFvTpBg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Back to School""</a> (recently <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNC5E2glckQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covered by Of Montreal</a>). And in contrast to Royal Trux's formative kill-yr-idols tack, we hear a more sincere interpretation of their influences here, including faithful covers of Milton Nascimento's Tropicália chestnut ""Faca Amolada"" and Jefferson Airplane's freedom-rockin' ""Law Man"", and, most curiously, a '93 Peel Session take on ""The Theme from M*A*S*H"". But in the last case, what on paper appears to be a cheeky exercise in 70s revivalism proves surprisingly devastating, as the song's chorus-- ""suicide is painless""-- takes on a several layers of significance when sung by a couple who once endured prolonged spells of addiction, poverty, and homelessness. Only in the hands of a band as peculiar and indefinable as Royal Trux could kitsch sound so affecting.</p></div>"|16012.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16012-royal-trux/|8.2|Stuart Berman

Triangulating toxic levels of intelligence, humor, and aggressiveness, they're exactly the kind of band who could be speaking truth to power. But, for the most part, Andy Falkous forgoes highfalutin political statements and just tells it like it is to us regular schmoes, at the risk of sounding like a jerk. But because even expert-level misanthropes have to deal with mundane problems like label woes (they never really fit on 4AD anyway) and lineup turbulence, the <i>Polymers Are Forever</i> EP is the first we've heard from the gleefully malevolent Welshmen since 2009's bulldozing <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13115-travels-with-myself-and-another/"" target=""_blank"">Travels With Myself and Another</a></i></p>
<p>With a full-length due next year, these six songs allow FOTL a relatively risk-free chance to regroup and familiarize themselves with some older inventory. <i>Polymers</i> isn't a total overhaul from the taut and punishing <i>Travels</i>, but it does dial back tempos and lean far more heavily on blaring arcade synthesizers-- starting with 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10698-curses/"" target=""_blank"">Curses</a></i>, it was the easiest thing to point out when differentiating FOTL from the unimpeachable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2720-mclusky/"" target=""_blank"">Mclusky</a>. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12637-polymers-are-forever/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> retains <i>Travel</i>'s blunt-force rhythms, but the structure leaves enough for the keyboards to add barbed texture and for an unusually campy Falkous to go ham, so to speak; adopting a nasal vowel-stretching honk to berate science's quick fixes, it's a scenery-chewing, karaoke rendering of Ozzy's coked-out nadir. It's understandable to focus on Falkous' lyrics, yet ""Polymers"" flashes compositional chops that are often overlooked in discussing FOTL, as it bisects into a nagging, hooky first half that leads to a mantra of stuttering syntax that becomes subtly anthemic.</p>
<p>Likewise, the best parts of <i>Polymers </i> sonically echo its leader: I didn't think a band could <i>sound </i> sarcastic as opposed to being it, but FOTL play with mean-spirited humor. Check the teeter-tottering polka of ""New Adventures"" that seems to exist solely to mock Falkous' woeful heroin addicts and born losers, or the intentional mispronunciation of a directive to a plastic surgeon-- ""Bob, do it""-- used for an off-beat ""bah-bah-bah-do-do"" chorus on ""Polymers Are Forever.""</p>
<p>Obviously, Falkous runs the show, and it's often hilarious, usually bilious, and almost always quotable. He might be <i>too</i> good at it, actually: While ""New Adventures"" is chock-full of enough great set-ups to spawn a dozen comic rants, the song itself plays as a loosely related chain of bon mots instead of a cogent narrative. Likewise, ""With Apologies to Emily Pankhurst"" hurtles forth with a velocity that can obscure a rhyme of pure gold like, ""I fear most women like I fear tomorrow-- absolutely/ I can't let something as French as fear determine this insecurity."" But when ""destroywhitchurch.com"" and ""My Wife Is Unhappy"" take turns into dead-eyed, tensile spoken-word somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"" target=""_blank"">Slint</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3414-pulp/"" target=""_blank"">Pulp</a>, they're too obscured in both subject matter and emotion to really be more than just admirably clever.</p>
<p>Since Future of the Left are so in their own zone, evaluating a release becomes something of a tautological exercise: It's good that they are around, even if I feel that it's more beneficial for the sake of others rather than my own listening pleasure. It's the sort of band you feel people could learn something from, even if they might be insulted in the process. And while ethically impressive, the relatively diverse <i>Polymers </i> doesn't quite stick around after it's over-- though it can strike you as sweet relief whenever you're feeling like the world's frightening stupidity occasionally owes us the comfort of disbelieving laughter.</p></div>"|16025.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16025-polymers-are-forever/|6.3|Ian Cohen

Tim Hellman, one of two guitarists in the band, played bass for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"" target=""_blank"">Ty Segall</a> on two of his records. Chrys Nodal, the second guitarist, is also a member of <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/lilacsf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lilac</a>. They even had Tim Cohen of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28104-the-fresh-onlys/"" target=""_blank"">the Fresh &amp; Onlys</a> serve as engineer for their first 7"". But for all those associations, Wet Illustrated aren't exactly a ""garage band"" in the purest sense of ""fuzz, hook, repeat."" There certainly are hooks, and their vocals are primarily punk-infused yelling, but they also let loose several frantic, gleeful melodies. <i>1x1x1</i> is primarily defined by the band's tone, which is alternately flippant and serious.</p>
<p>Their giant melodies are one of the biggest selling points of <i>1x1x1</i>. ""Marketplace"" features a fist pumping, rousing, power-pop chorus. The otherwise aggressive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1498-satellite-kids/"" target=""_blank"">""Satellite Kids""</a> calms down in the middle with a soothing mandolin lick. There's another mandolin at the beginning of ""Saints"" backed by some gentle acoustic-guitar strums; moments later, there's more yelling. That's the sweet and sour duality they're dealing with for most of the album. On one hand, twee-leaning (but never cutesy or saccharine) flourishes. On the other, boisterous yelling and loud guitars. That more aggressive and assertive aesthetic becomes problematic after a while-- ultimately, it's a little over 30 minutes of that largely unswerving, monotonous yelling vocal. After a while, it starts to grate.</p>
<p>The contrasting attitudes of the record give Wet Illustrated several chances to illustrate what they're capable of, though. They can ramp up the punk aggression on a song like ""My Head"", and within seconds, they're joyously screaming, ""Hey hey hey hey,"" at the opening of ""Claws"". They do well with each look-- they're convincing while they urgently shout paranoid lyrics over a minor-chord progression, and they sound confidently silly with the more upbeat material. But those contrasting tones have a hard time sitting together after multiple listens, especially when they're contained within the same song. ""Herman's Head"" is perhaps the worst offender, with its sunny xylophone counterbalanced with obnoxious lyrics and vocal affectations.</p>
<p>But even the most heinous instances of tonal whiplash are fairly forgivable-- Wet Illustrated are, at their core, three goofy-sounding Bay Area punks, and individually, the songs are pretty fun. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12601-gypsy-town/"" target=""_blank"">""Gypsy Town""</a> epitomizes the more erratically joyous aspects of the album, with its sun-baked riff and optimistic lyrics (looking down on the clouds while drunk gypsies spread love around). As lyricists, they use a lot of absurd imagery, which works well with their tone. ""Born Stoked"" is another sunny story of a blindly optimistic dude named Stevie-- he leaves his job, but he keeps smiling and seeing good in the world. Even if it's anchored by a 1990s surfer buzzword, it's the sort of subject matter this band can sell without trying. That's probably because, throughout the record, they sound just as optimistic and stoked as this character. Again, that's not always to their advantage, but at least it sounds genuine.</p>
<p>At the core of the record is a series of fuzzy pop songs vaguely reminiscent of the work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1956-robyn-hitchcock/"" target=""_blank"">Robyn Hitchcock</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3353-robert-pollard/"" target=""_blank"">Robert Pollard</a>, guys who could muster infectiously hook-y melodies while being great lyricists. Wet Illustrated are pretty good at both things. Throughout the album, there are hooks that stick and don't let up. They also have the spastically excited lyrics to match that frantic shout, even if some of the words are more abstract. Given the energy pulsating throughout <i>1x1x1</i>, these songs will probably hit especially hard live. It's unfortunate, then, that they're presented on an album that's a little too crowded.</p></div>"|16023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16023-wet-illustrated-1x1x1/|6.8|Evan Minsker

Early tracks from the now 21-year-old Louis Jones similarly mixed 1950s and 60s doo-wop and pop with a modern indie rock mentality. Dense, lo-fi textures and hummable hooks left his work rich in color and personality, and the gritty walls of sound were decidedly punk rock. When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28096-male-bonding/"" target=""_blank"">Male Bonding</a> included the Spectrals track ""It's Very Kind of You to Put Up With Me"" on the first compilation from their label, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/paradisevendorsinc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paradise Vendors</a>, it felt like a slow-motion, acid-fueled spin on a creaking Coney Island ride, Jones' soulful croon buried under washes of red reverb.</p>
<p>At a point when ear-to-the-ground actually meant eye-to-MySpace, Jones made an account, uploaded some songs, and friended Woodsist and Captured Tracks. The latter label messaged him about a 7"", ""Leave Me Be"", which followed in November of that year, and is now one of the imprint's most essential out-of-print singles. It ushered Spectrals into what ought to be remembered as Gen Y's International Blog-Pop Underground-- a scene that in 2009 included hyper lo-fi acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27600-dum-dum-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Dum Dum Girls</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29914-the-twerps/"" target=""_blank"">Twerps</a>. Whether the ramshackle renaissance of 2009 was rooted in fashion or necessity is an open question, but Spectrals were in and of that underground Spector-fueled wave, and have since released material on a handful of international D.I.Y. labels.</p>
<p>These groups have all shed some fuzz by now, so it's no surprise that on Jones' first proper full-length, <i>Bad Penny</i>, he makes a similarly slick departure. Indeed, the sound of <i>Bad Penny </i>is related only peripherally to his previous releases. Though it's hardly overproduced, Jones barely employs any reverb at all, and while his evolved sonic identity might be jarring to existing Spectrals fans, the polish sounds better over time.</p>
<p>Indie rock readings of Phil Spector pop are almost passé at this point, but Jones makes it work due in no small part to his English wit, articulation, and gray mood. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12459-get-a-grip/"" target=""_blank"">""Get a Grip""</a> opens with a small, fun riff, prefacing a crooned rhyme: ""I need to get a grip, I always seem to let my smile slip."" His delivery is slow and monotone, as he stretches each fifth syllable or so, but it's a toe-tapper, underpinned by cool bits of bongo and guitar. The bongo drum returns later on ""You Don't Have to Tell Me"", and whether or not the 50s jazz-club feel comes with a wink, its faux-sophistication still comes over as charming. ""Luck Is There to Be Pushed"" has a similar effect, but this time with the runs of jazz piano that fleck its dramatically soft guitar strums and subtle, gliding synths.</p>
<p>The upbeat punch and texture on ""Big Baby"" and ""Confetti"" make for two of the album's most lively tracks, the latter offering a clever joke about dating: ""If what you call fun is courting, bring on the confetti."" That hidden humor makes it easy to celebrate the record's smoothness, even on its more mysterious side. ""Many Happy Returns"", for example, is a slow-moving piece of pop poetry that recalls a hard-boiled Dashiell Hammett novel. Its sway starts with a sharp sentiment of after-school romantic uncertainty: ""Stood waiting for your Ma to collect you/ Wondering if she ever asked you/ Who I was to you?/ And wishing that I knew.""</p>
<p><i>Bad Penny</i> has its weak points. The second track, ""Lockjaw"", is soulful but tired and awkwardly placed, tearing down the mood of the album after a sharp opening, and Jones' lyrics in general can seem recycled. Still, the record's main dividing line is the production, as there is a real philosophical shift that comes with moving away from lo-fi. Slumberland devotees might identify more with Spectrals' original grassroots mentality, but the album's more broadly inviting sound ties the band into a realm of music that rock critic Ellen Willis called ""ecumenical pop."" It's music pleasant enough to carry intergenerational appeal, characterized by a youthful spirit but rooted in a classic sound. <i>Bad Penny</i>, then, is ultimately a solid debut that is still surprisingly safe.</p></div>"|16019.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16019-bad-penny/|7.5|Jenn Pelly

""I think it's part of the deal. If they don't die on a cross by 33, I'd ask for your money back."" Like many of the knowingly audacious quotes from the singer and his <a href=""http://www.u2.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">U2</a> mates during this period, it's a little tough to deduce the exact level of sincerity involved. And that was the whole idea. In the early 1990s, U2 were sending up the idea of a ""rock'n'roll star."" They were offering themselves as an ironic, postmodern band for similarly confused times. They were making fun of themselves and their own humorless, slate-faced 80s reputation. A year after Bono's casual quip about pop stars dying on a cross, Kurt Cobain killed himself. And in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a>'s final video, for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6P0SitRwy8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heart-Shaped Box""</a>, Cobain could be seen making wild eyes in front of one.</p>
<p><i>Achtung Baby</i> and its accompanying Zoo TV tour lived within the slippage between perception and reality. ""Sometimes you can get far closer to the truth of what you're trying to say by highlighting what it isn't as if it were true,"" said the Edge on ""Naked City"". ""That's assuming we know the truth-- 'truth' is one of those words that's lost its meaning."" In the 80s, U2 seemed endlessly in search of a definite truth, whether in peace or god or love or some ambiguous combination of the three. Famously, they didn't find it.</p>
<p>But the quest was thrilling-- at least until 1988's album and film <i>Rattle and Hum</i>, which found the group looking and sounding spectacularly self-serious while gawkily paying tribute to some of their American heroes like Elvis Presley and B.B. King. The resulting critical backlash caused these open-hearted Irishmen to reflect, and they weren't crazy about what they saw in the mirror. ""We looked like a big, overblown rock band running amok,"" says Bono in an excellent new documentary called <i>From the Sky Down</i> that chronicles the band's pivotal turn-of-the-decade moment. And while that might seem like an aptly derisive opinion of today's incarnation of U2, it's important to remember that these guys originally came out of the cacophony of rule-breaking post-punk, a realm where bloated arena rock was the enemy. So they went away and tried to come up with a new way to seek some truth.</p>
<p><i>Achtung Baby</i> is rightly known as one of rock's greatest reinventions because it was so complete. Sure, U2 changed their sound from chiming melodics to lurching, distorted rhythm. But they also changed their attitude, their demeanor, their look, their ideas on how to deal with celebrity. All of a sudden, they were funny, sexy, a bit dangerous-- three things few would've associated with U2 in the 80s. And yet, at their core, the band's values remained constant. They were still ethically minded and interested in the real-life connection between living beings. But the way they went about projecting those core tenets flipped. In TV-news parlance, their attitude switched from ""60 Minutes"" to ""The Colbert Report"".</p>
<p>This new era was conveniently spelled-out on <i>Achtung</i>'s first single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_82IYrdM2vU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Fly""</a> with the Edge's metallic skronk and Bono's conspiratorial, effected whisper of lines like, ""It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest/ It's no secret that ambition bites the nails of success."" And just as the album goes lengths to both fulfill and upend rock'n'roll myths with thorny tales of deep betrayal, questioned fidelity, and ambiguous artifice, this coffee-table-book sized, 6xCD, 4xDVD set both props up <i>Achtung</i> and pokes a few holes in it, too.</p>
<p>Take the album's much-ballyhooed place of origin, Berlin's Hansa Studios. This was the location that played host to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"" target=""_blank"">David Bowie</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3369-iggy-pop/"" target=""_blank"">Iggy Pop</a>'s electronic-inspired masterworks <i>Low</i> and <i>The Idiot</i>. And Hansa is located near the Berlin Wall, which had only recently been breached when U2 set up there in the fall of 1990. Perched literally in the middle of historic liberation, U2 were meant to find inspiration in the world events around them and turn that spark into a new version of the band for a new decade. It's a great backdrop for a great story. But it didn't really go down that way. ""We're there, and greatness has left the building,"" Bono recalls in <i>From the Sky Down</i>, which features the band returning to Hansa earlier this year in preparation for their headlining set at Glastonbury.</p>
<p>While Berlin did inspire bits of the record-- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YptgC3goAUY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Zoo Station""</a> was named after one of its prominent train terminals-- it hardly lived up to its lofty reputation. This serves as a lesson for U2, a band that shamelessly worships past rock heroes, to move past such naïve mythologizing. ""Berlin was a baptism of fire,"" says bassist Adam Clayton in the documentary. ""It was something we had to go through to realize what we were trying to get to was not something you could find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city-- that there was not magic to it and that we actually had to put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down."" This newfound pragmatism would help them to move past their fantasies about the sanctity of rock. So while Berlin played a part on <i>Achtung Baby</i>, it did so in surprising ways; though <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftjEcrrf7r0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""One""</a> was mostly written in a burst of inspiration in Hansa, most of the album truly came together once the group went back home to Dublin.</p>
<p>Most of the audio bonuses in this set are unfortunately superfluous, and don't offer much in terms of insight. There are two CDs filled with dance remixes, and while U2 were at the vanguard of big time rock bands embracing the notion of the remix, even the most devout rave nostalgist would have little use for six remakes of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxcDTUMLQJI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mysterious Ways""</a>. The disc of bonus material and B-sides is disappointingly slight, and another filled with early versions of every song on <i>Achtung</i> offers a few revelations-- an Irish jig-style version of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2dL-DjAkek"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World""</a> has an easy charm, but generally, it's easy to see why these attempts were improved upon later. <i>Achtung</i>'s even more electronic and weirder follow-up, 1993's <i>Zooropa</i>-- which was recorded in a creative frenzy during a break in the Zoo TV tour-- is also included, though it's generally (and somewhat unfairly) glossed over in all the accompanying materials.</p>
<p>The worthy additions in this ""super deluxe edition"" are nearly all visual. There's Anton Corbijn's gorgeous and colorful photography that covers its case, as well as a big, sturdy 84-page book. And then the four discs of video: <i>It Might Get Loud</i> director Davis Guggenheim's new 90-minute doc<i> From the Sky Down</i>, every video from the era, a full live gig taped in Australia in 1993, interview shows (like ""Naked City""), and, best of all, a playfully subversive TV special from 1992 that includes live footage from the Zoo TV tour as well as goofy interludes that play up the surrealism and insanity of the whole project. Moments like the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHKMoLY5ueY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Even Better Than the Real Thing""</a> video, with the band playing in a glass case while fans look on outside, successfully tie in all the pomo flourishes U2 were chasing. The group was at the forefront of bringing huge video screens into the live arena, and some of the tricks they pull off-- Bono ""dueting"" with a static-y <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"" target=""_blank"">Lou Reed</a> or flipping channels to live local stations-- still look impressive. And for all the technical wizardry of the stage setup, the band still uses it to complement the music rather than overshadow it. Even 20 years on, the tour looks like something to behold, a singularly inventive experience that no band-- including U2 itself-- has been able to really expound upon in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>In the Zoo TV special, which originally aired during Thanksgiving weekend in 1992, a ""news commentator"" covering the show dubs it ""the most significant and exciting TV event since the Gulf War."" Some of the ideas behind Zoo TV and <i>Achtung Baby</i> were inspired by the television coverage of that initial Gulf War in 1991, and the bizarre reality of being able to switch channels from home shopping to MTV to the bombing of Baghdad. U2 recognized the dangers of this idea, when war turned into just more filler for the burgeoning 24-hour TV-news cycle. And instead of preaching against it in a high and mighty fashion, they embraced that chaos in an effort to expose it. Of course, our collective information overload has been upped exponentially since thanks to the internet, making the flashes of words and slogans that backed U2 during their live campaign seem eerily prophetic. Talking about the Zoo TV audience in the ""Naked City"" interview, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. says, ""They're coming to a rock'n'roll show and watching television, what more can you ask for?"" He's joking, but as we go to arenas and see singers on big screens through our cellphone cameras, the question begins to answer itself.</p></div>"|16022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16022-achtung-baby-super-deluxe-edition/|9.5|Ryan Dombal

As a title, <i>Humor Risk </i>functions as a sort of riddle, one where the answer comes quickly but you still feel silly for not getting it earlier. McCombs probably prefers it that way. In a rare, cagey <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8701-cass-mccombs/"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal, he defended the grim and elegantly dark <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15343-wits-end/"" target=""_blank"">WIT'S END</a></i>: ""You can't just explain a joke, can you? Either it isn't funny, or the person just totally missed the punchline.""</p>
<p>To be fair, that record did have a punchline or two buried beneath its incessant gloom. But McCombs' work has never really been <i>expressively</i> funny, and by his standards, <i>Humor Risk</i> is something of a laugh riot. There's a hapless drug deal that ends in murder (reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3786-silver-jews/"" target=""_blank"">Silver Jews</a>' also-pretty-funny <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tO_w3H3Bo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""San Francisco, B.C.""</a>), a philosophical discussion on the nature of beauty in a mannequin factory, and a domestic ghost story that may or may not compare California to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_%28mythology%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a mythical, fire-breathing creature</a>.</p>
<p>Another topic raised in that interview is McCombs' reclusive nature and his penchant for personal privacy, which in the Internet age, fairly or not, seems like an unusual character trait. Since we don't know much about McCombs, save for his fascination with death and that he's lived as a nomad for most of his life, it's unclear whether his reservations about giving away personal details are due to something darker within him, or an intent to lend mystique and character to an otherwise relatively normal nomadic singer/songwriter type.</p>
<p>Either way, McCombs isn't any more ready to reveal himself on <i>Humor Risk</i>; he delivers many of the lyrics to ""The Living Word"", a meditation on personal and universal spirituality, in a warm half-mutter that requires a lyric book to truly comprehend what he's saying. Religion is a touchy topic for McCombs, and here, even when he's embracing a somewhat positive message of universal existence on ""The Living Word"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12363-the-same-thing/"" target=""_blank"">""The Same Thing""</a>, he's reluctant to say too much.</p>
<p>Sonically, however, <i>Humor Risk</i> is his most straightforward and outgoing record to date, and the first time he's cranked up the electric guitars and dry drums since 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10768-dropping-the-writ/"" target=""_blank"">Dropping the Writ</a></i>. The album's most upbeat songs chug like poppy mantras-- if McCombs were into such a thing, opener ""Love Thine Enemy"" could comfortably soundtrack some movie or TV commercial-- while the straightforward beauty contained in other cuts is often designed with tricky simplicity. There's an easy likability to most of this album, even if McCombs' ever-present opaqueness seems somewhat superfluous when he's in this zone.</p>
<p>Production-wise, McCombs and frequent collaborator Ariel Rechtshaid have made the most of this album's piecemeal-recorded nature (<i></i>recording was spread out in various homes and studios in California, Chicago, and New Jersey). The backing vocals on ""The Same Thing"" are chilly and hair-raising, while ""To Every Man His Chimera"", which sounds like a <i>WIT'S END</i> cut with enjoyably hammy theatricality added for good measure, is interrupted intermittently by distant voices and barking dogs. Like its creator, <i>Humor Risk</i> just <i>sounds</i> all over the place. In a certain sense, that's a good thing, as it only takes some homespun recording trickery to make McCombs seem distant and vaguely in-transit on even the most hard-driving songs here.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <i>Humor Risk</i> is a minor work in his growing (and impeccably consistent) catalog; unlike <i>WIT'S END</i> and 2009's soft-focus career-high <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13180-catacombs/"" target=""_blank"">Catacombs</a></i>, it plays less like an ""album"" and more like a ""collection of songs,"" a factor that may make it something of a difficult initial listen. There are a handful of solid songs on <i>Humor Risk</i>, though, without an outright dud in the bunch-- and if that represents a disappointment, then in the end, the joke might be on us.</p></div>"|16014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16014-humor-risk/|7.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

Make no mistake, that's a compliment: Were indie rock its own island nation, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"" target=""_blank"">Minutemen</a>'s credo of simplicity and Emersonian self-reliance ""We Jam Econo"" would be stitched proudly on the flag. So, in a moment when every bedroom recording artist can GarageBand her own backing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3361-the-polyphonic-spree/"" target=""_blank"">Polyphonic Spree</a> into existence, there's something refreshing about a band like, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"" target=""_blank"">Japandroids</a>, whose music sounds like a sonic tribute to the camaraderie of the flesh-and-blood, guitar-and-drums duo. Coasting's crash-pop-meets-surf-rock works like this too: combining rumbling riffage; hyperactive, cymbal-heavy drumming; and fervent, back-and-forth vocals into a classic D.I.Y. sound. This isn't minimalism, exactly: It's the joyful sound of two people trying to make as much noise as they possibly can.</p>
<p>Those two people are guitarist Madison Farmer and drummer Fiona Campbell, a New Zealand transplant who's also been drumming with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19442-vivian-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Vivian Girls</a> for a little over a year. Over the first few tracks of <i>You're Never Going Back</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> at least, Farmer and Campbell create irresistibly shambolic tunes (""Starts and Stays"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12604-coasting-portland/"" target=""_blank"">""Portland""</a>) that escalate in breathless energy as they creep toward the three-minute mark. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14493-kids/"" target=""_blank"">""Kids""</a> starts unassumingly, in a steady blizzard of cymbals and power chords before it picks up with the intensity of a couple of kids running down a steep hill, hollering double dares all the way down: Pick up the tempo! Play louder! Sing ""Ohhhh!"" Louder still! As in Campbell's other band, echoes of girl-group melodies poke through the grit, as though plucked from fuzzy memories. The feeling is reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22285-kicking-giant/"" target=""_blank"">Kicking Giant</a>'s 1990s cult classic </span><i>Alien ID</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">: Its emotional climax is the sound of imperfect, warbling voices imploring, with more volume and punch each time, ""Be my/ Be my baby.”</span></p>
<p>Up until now, Coasting have lived largely in the world of 7""s. The problem with their debut album is one that's befallen countless perfectly good indie bands before them: They don't have enough ideas to fill a whole LP. <i>You're Never Going Back</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> definitely boasts their best standalone tracks, but after a while, the limitations of their sound become apparent. The energy lags in the record's middle section, over a stretch of samey-sounding, mid-tempo numbers. Bill Skibbe and Jessica Ruffin's production keeps things simple and thus captures the freewheeling spirit of the band's live performance, but by the fourth mid-tempo, quiet-loud-quiet jam, you get to wishing for an experimental streak-- or at least another pedal.</span></p>
<p>This might not be a problem for you. There's something inherently affable about Coasting's sound, which has the grimy, big-hearted spirit of an early K Records release. And if you're predisposed to liking garage rock or music that extols the virtues of all things handmade (check that punk rock cross-stitch on the album cover), you are not likely to hold Coasting's lack of sonic variety or next-big-thing ambition against them. This year, though, I'm feeling extra critical, still under the moment-defining spell of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27618-tune-yards/"" target=""_blank"">tUnE-yArDs</a>' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15321-w-h-o-k-i-l-l/"" target=""_blank"">w h o k i l l</a></i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. That record sounds nothing like </span><i>You're Never Going Back</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, but it affirmed something important-- that a record can be brimming with ideas and unabashedly huge, and yet still sound unmistakably handmade. Like a lot of the classics in the indie rock canon, </span><i>w h o k i l l</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> stands as a provocative D.I.Y. challenge: You can do more with your bare hands and your own voice than you ever dreamed. (No, this idea isn't new; even the dudes who said, ""We Jam Econo,"" made a record with 45 songs on it.) ""I've seen the future and it's perfectly all right,"" Farmer sings with muted pathos on the album's last track, a bittersweet ballad called ""Delusions of Grandeur"". Those aren't always such bad things.</span></p></div>"|16017.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16017-coasting-youre-never-going-back/|6.8|Lindsay Zoladz

In real life, of course, such collaborations have <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/reviews/albums/15996-lou-reed-metallica/"" target=""_blank"">a notoriously checkered history</a>. Yet there are still instances when the artists in question present a match too tantalizing to resist, and <i>200 Years</i> is one such example. The duo is comprised of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3807-six-organs-of-admittance/"" target=""_blank"">Six Organs of Admittance</a>'s Ben Chasny and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2986-magik-markers/"" target=""_blank"">Magik Markers</a>' Elisa Ambrogio, and together they draw on the quieter echoes of their other projects to create a charming new hybrid.</p>
<p>It helps that Chasny is an old hand at just this sort of collaboration, and a bit of a chameleon besides. In addition to his gigantic Six Organs of Admittance catalog, he has been a member of noise rock troupe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Comets on Fire</a> and improv units <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28815-rangda/"" target=""_blank"">Rangda</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/278-badgerlore/"" target=""_blank"">Badgerlore</a>, and his endlessly creative guitar work has been a welcome presence everywhere it has turned up. Each has served as a touring musician for the others' main gig, and Chasny and Ambrogio previously collaborated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2989-mouthus/"" target=""_blank"">Mouthus</a>' Brian Sullivan in the noise-drone Basalt Fingers, but there is nothing from that trio that anticipated the hushed, song-based style of <i>200 Years</i>.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise on <i>200 Years</i> is Ambrogio and the gentle, almost demure performances that she delivers throughout the album. Though her work with Magik Markers has usually been distinguished by the wide-ranging ferocity of her vocals, there have been glimmers of her quieter side on such studio albums as <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10700-boss/"" target=""_blank"">BOSS</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13004-balf-quarry/"" target=""_blank"">Balf Quarry</a></i>. Still, it is unexpected to hear her sing so softly at such length, with her voice providing a natural foil for Chasny's predominantly acoustic guitars. At times she recalls the solo work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2665-barbara-manning/"" target=""_blank"">Barbara Manning</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24194-lois-maffeo/"" target=""_blank"">Lois Maffeo</a>, a fact that would be astonishing to anyone only familiar with Ambrogio via one of Magik Markers' feral live recordings.</p>
<p>Consisting almost entirely of voices and guitars, there is an ageless quality to <i>200 Years. </i>The album is bookended by its two most immediately mesmeric songs, ""Wild White"" and ""More Than Alive"", both of which are sturdy, melodic gems that could seemingly translate into any idiom. Here they are given the simplest possible treatment, riding along only on the interplay of Ambrogio's voice and Chasny's expertly filigreed guitar lines, the production so intimate that it feels like eavesdropping on a private conversation.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, as on ""Partin Wayz"" or ""Thread"", the duo adds discreet electric guitar effects or a quietly droning harmonium to the mix, always with the lightest of touch. None of these effects will shock those familiar with Chasny's previous work, and in its drowsier patches <i>200 Years</i> can seem to be merely a Six Organs of Admittance tape with female vocals placed overhead. Which is hardly a bad formula in itself, but it might disappoint those hoping for more in the way of improvisational fireworks. On ""Bees"" Ambrogio does deliver what sounds like a front porch version of her Magik Marker lyrical cascade, with her words casually spilling out just as quickly as she can enunciate them.</p>
<p>The most impressive aspect of <i>200 Years</i>, especially considering it as the debut of a new collaboration, is its overall aura of cool confidence. Chasny and Ambrogio are clearly two talented musicians with a wide variety of tools at their disposal, yet to their credit they don't feel the need to try and show every trick at once. Instead they show an innate sense of trust in one another and in this resonant collection of songs, secure in the knowledge that this should be plenty.</p></div>"|16018.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16018-200-years-200-years/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

It picks up nicely where L.A. mixmasters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29623-nguzunguzu/"" target=""_blank"">Nguzunguzu</a> left off when they made a 12-minute ""megamix"" of <i>WARN-U</i>, pumping the EP's original three cuts full of skittery beats and bass.</p>
<p>This EP could stand on its own as a piece of music suited for dancing under the right combination of fog and lasers, but it remains connected to her aesthetic as a whole. <i>GSX</i> showcases Al Qadiri's ability to evoke, using sound only, the uncanny and seductive themes she dreams up and explores visually. So it makes sense that the release party for the EP took place at New York's New Museum, complete with a screening of corresponding videos created by a horde of collaborators. But you don't need videos to get a grip on Al Qadiri's haunting, pan-cultural visions. Looking at the tracklist before listening to the EP, you might figure the title ""Hip Hop Spa"" to be just a nifty and offhanded combination of words; listening to the bassy, new age-bending song, though, it's clear that Al Qadiri has thought about exactly what music might be played at a hip-hop spa, if such a thing existed (in fact, she should probably open one). ""Vatican Vibes"", the EP's centerpiece, is a degree more suggestive still, folding Gregorian chants into a thumping, futuristic synth-and-steel-drum backdrop. All five songs deliver on the slickly gaudy, <span class=""s1"">pillar-laden poolside setup</span> gracing the cover.</p>
<p><i>GSX</i> can lean toward gimmickry, but Al Qadiri stays on the right side of that line throughout most of the EP's 23 minutes. The only place she misfires is on ""Corpcore"", a shrill, forgettable closer that was first released over a year ago. Perhaps it was tacked on as an afterthought because its visual counterpart was put together by newly high-profile video-installation artist Ryan Trecartin. Regardless, its predecessors are substantive and strong enough that it doesn't much detract from the project's overarching vision: otherworldly, synthetic amalgams of dance sub-genres that sound like they've been sent from the future. Al Qadiri is a jack-of-all-trades-- she writes a well-informed <a href=""http://dismagazine.com/blog/global-wav/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">column</a> on global music, DJs, and exhibits her visual art in galleries around the world-- but <i>GSX</i> gives her original solo music a solid push to the forefront of her broad output.</p></div>"|16021.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16021-genre-specific-xperience/|7.5|Carrie Battan

That weirdness-- the visceral, surrealistic imagery and fragmented plots in his movies-- is  exactly what we as viewers want from him. You probably like it  weird now and then. I do too. It's what thrills us, confuses us, and keeps us coming back for more.</p>
<p>One  of the elements that defines Lynch's films is the way he uses music, especially music from the 1950s and early 60s. Seemingly innocuous songs are set in relief against scenes of violence  or desperation in ways that reveal some latent passion that might be  hard to hear on oldies radio. The era is crucial: Slowdances and  big-bad-wolf blues are styles whose tensions are born of repression.  Making your sexual desires known was not much of an option in the 1950s,  so the music worked via metaphor and concealment and, as a result, quaked  with subterranean energy that had no safe outlet. Lynch's scenes provide that outlet. When he uses a song as soundtrack, he transforms it.</p>
<p>Music in his movies arrives at high-water moments. Dennis Hopper <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP2OwiCmk88&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">does himself up in lipstick to Roy Orbison's ""In Dreams""</a> before assaulting poor Kyle MacLachlan in <i>Blue Velvet</i>, Naomi Watts and Laura Harring<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIpkMg9sh6Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> sob to Rebekah del Rio's performance of Orbison's ""Crying""</a> in <i>Mulholland Drive</i>, and Jack Nance, saddled with his horrible alien baby at the edge of domestic sanity in <i>Eraserhead</i>, is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qrl3n2ZtK2E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">serenaded by a tiny, grotesque woman inside his radiator</a>. In these scenes, the music is used in the same way that we as listeners  often use it: to pump ourselves up, to give us space to emote, or to  find solace. Lynch's sense of music is intuitive that way, and probably  one of the most plainly sympathetic aspects of his movies.</p>
<p><i>Crazy Clown Time</i>,  while technically a proper debut full-length, is far from the first time Lynch has  had a hand in the actual writing and performing of music. He was making  noises with Alan Splet as early as <i>Eraserhead</i>, and has done soundtrack work on nearly every movie he's directed through 2006's <i>Inland Empire</i>. He recorded a pleasant-enough ""soundscape"" titled <i>The Air Is On Fire</i> in 2007, and in 2009, he released the <i>Fox Bat Strategy</i> EP, a collaboration featuring musicians with whom he'd worked since <i>Fire Walk With Me</i>, including deceased vocalist Dave Jaurequi, to whom the record was dedicated. And before these, he produced and wrote lyrics for two airy makeout albums by singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29150-julee-cruise/"" target=""_blank"">Julee Cruise</a> in the late 1980s and early 90s which ought to be studied by all young women who try to sing like undead phone-sex operators.</p>
<p>But <i>Crazy Clown Time</i> is largely a solo project, and most of its material is what you might expect from an album made by David Lynch: tense, repetitive bluesy music permeated by reverb and echo. The remaining few songs-- including the record's first single, ""Good Day Today""-- are not. These other songs are disco, sort of: dark, mid-tempo electronic pop. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6468-karen-o/"" target=""_blank"">Karen O</a> sings in  places (most prominently on the album's standout opening track, ""Pinky's  Dream""), but the bulk of the album is actually sung by Lynch through  vocoders and other modulating effects. (If you've seen Lynch's movies  but never heard him speak, you are depriving yourself a harmless treat. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XliMny3AvnE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here</a>.)  His lyrics are also more or less what you might expect: simple,  fragmented, and a bit dull on the page, but threateningly voiced in his  high, twanging pitch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, none  of these songs actually feel like <i>songs</i>. Only a few have choruses or any significant chord changes. Instead, they're set pieces, which makes sense: Lynch's films often seem to be more about luxuriating in his atmosphere than about following his plots, and that carries over to this music as well. But as unfair as this observation might seem to Lynch as a musician, the question I end up asking after listening to <i>Crazy Clown Time</i> is: Hasn't he already accomplished all this in his movies more  successfully? In light of his filmography, the album feels familiar to the point of redundancy. Why does he stop with seven minutes of lecturing in a robot voice about how to think positively? Couldn't the album use <i>more</i> abstraction-heavy lectures about positive thinking conveyed in robotic voices? I think so. But maybe I only think that because I come to Lynch for surprise and disruption.</p>
<p>It's been five  years since Lynch made <i>Inland Empire</i>. From what I can tell, he spends a lot of his time in the spotlight eagerly promoting  Transcendental Meditation. He recently designed a nightclub in Paris.  So, alright. My purely speculative guess is that <i>Crazy Clown Time</i> is just part of a temporary break from feature filmmaking-- not as heinous as some vanity projects, but an album that will satisfy some personal  need, be minorly exciting to fans who will follow him wherever he goes, and end up ignored by both parties in time. Anyone who hasn't seen  his movies would benefit from seeing almost all of them before  listening to it.</p></div>"|15999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15999-david-lynch-crazy-clown-time/|6.1|Mike Powell

After an infamously torturous decade or so in the industry, Pusha now resides comfortably at G.O.O.D. Music, the imprint run by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a> that most notably houses guys like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/806-common/"" target=""_blank"">Common</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8562-kid-cudi/"" target=""_blank"">Kid Cudi</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"" target=""_blank"">Big Sean</a>. Pusha is the only guy remotely resembling a street rapper at the label, and though it's hard to figure out exactly what role he plays in the context of the label or even the genre writ large, it's a marriage that probably makes more sense than not. The days of Pusha, Drug Kingpin are long gone and have been for a while.</p>
<p>Maybe the rapper that Pusha most resembles now is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>. Though Pusha's cocaine-dealing past is bona fide (or close enough that no one bothers to question it), his identity as a drug dealer is now merely an imagined idea, a cachet that he rides but one that's far back in the rearview. The act of selling drugs, and the burdens and spoils that come with it, rarely enters his music anymore, and when it does, it rings as hollow as Ross' claims that you can call him up right now on his iPhone and score some dope. But of course it doesn't really matter if Pusha and Ross slip into personas either old or imagined, because a lack of proper reality or authenticity in rap has never dragged down music that was good in the first place. Where the Pusha of old was a witty and smart street hawk, the Pusha of the last five years or so has mirrored Kanye's and Ross' obsessions with luxury. If anything, it's in his ability to bridge the gap between those two rappers that Pusha finds his identity; he is as comfortable rapping about a yacht that a drug dealer might own as he is rapping about a scarf that a fashion designer might own.</p>
<p>But as Pusha has inched his way into the elite of rap, his music (including the material he recorded with his brother as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/960-clipse/"" target=""_blank"">Clipse</a> after their 2006 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9658-hell-hath-no-fury/"" target=""_blank"">Hell Hath No Fury</a></i>) has become exponentially less vital. He raps about luxury because he's a rich and famous rapper, and that's what rich and famous rappers do, and while there's nothing inherently wrong with that move, it's decidedly dulled the impact of his writing. Pusha has always carried himself with the bravado and ego of a star, and that was galvanizing when in his early years he played the role of a dealer-turned-rapper. But as a regular rapper who pops bottles in penthouses with a bunch of other rappers, that egotism has become commonplace, if not off-putting.</p>
<p>Yet here's the funny thing about <i>Fear of God II</i>, his first commercially released solo album: It proffers that, well, maybe none of that even matters. Pusha's rapping still noticeably pales in comparison to his peak years, and it would be hard to argue that there is any justification for the album's existence beyond Pusha needing to do something-- yet the stakes are so low that the sheer listenability of the album can sneak up on you. Its quality is mostly a testament to Pusha's connections and his ear for beats, but the rapping is sufficiently competent enough that the album never drags, which is less of a backhanded compliment than it might read.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like much thought was put into sequencing (French Montana <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12515-body-work-ft-juicy-j-meek-mill-and-french-montana/"" target=""_blank"">shows up</a> on two straight tracks) or thematic cohesion (""Feeling Myself"", the album's one slick R&amp;B song, is followed up by the metallic jitter of the <i>HHNF</i> throwback ""Raid""), but that strangely only intensifies the strength of the album, which is that Pusha collected seven or eight great tracks and then mostly got the hell out of the way. The process of releasing a rap album through a major label is so arduous now that albums often arrive in stores pushing 20 total songs with almost the same number of guests. <i>Fear of God II</i>'s brevity is both refreshing and crucial to its success, and it likely speaks to Pusha's self-confidence that he felt comfortable clipping the tracklist at 12.</p>
<p>This is ruthlessly professional rap music, and though that might seem like the baseline for releasing a major-label rap album, 2011 has been an awful year so far big-box releases. Pusha may be a fish out of water performing on a weepy Kanye ballad or being in a crew with John Legend, but releasing a major-label album with consistent rapping, great beats, a rational guest list, and a sane running time qualifies as a minor miracle right now.</p></div>"|16010.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16010-fear-of-god-ii/|7.1|Jordan Sargent

But you could put <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>'s name on the cover of just about anything and generate intense anticipation and scrutiny. Our prime architect of interdisciplinary electronic art has so much authority that when I don't love one of his records, I feel disappointed in <i>myself</i>. That was the case with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15598-drums-between-the-bells/"">Drums Between the Bells</a></i>, a worthy but uneven collaboration with the poet <a href=""http://rickholland.posterous.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rick Holland</a>, where sonic miracles sat cheek-by-jowl with dated electronic styles perhaps better left in mothballs. Now, from the same sessions, comes <i>Panic of Looking</i>. It's very slight, and its clearest purpose is to augment Eno's recent residency at Asheville, N.C.'s <a href=""http://moogfest.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moogfest</a> (which honors electronic music pioneer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moog"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robert Moog</a>), where the EP received an early release. But even Eno's spare parts give us something of substance to chew over.</p>
<p><i>Panic of Looking</i> is distinguished from its father LP by placing more emphasis on the words. This is a happy development, because poetry is delicate. It can sound strained, or even fake, when it tries to scale the visceral heights of music. Instead, music must lay back. If the glitchy sonics of <i>Drums Between the Bells</i> sometimes ran roughshod over the words, <i>Panic</i> verges on overcorrection. Eno has engineered it to feel like Holland's show-- spoken-word with accompaniment, sometimes engaged and sometimes desultory. It can be difficult to discuss the musical quotient because there's so little of it. The most developed tracks are ""In the Future"" and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12401-panic-of-looking/"">title piece</a>. The former draws out the tonality of speech via placid melodic counterpoint and euphoric backing vocals, recalling the joyous world-pop of Eno/Byrne collaboration <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12151-everything-that-happens-will-happen-today/"">Everything That Happens Will Happen Today</a></i>. The latter may be the best-balanced effort the collaboration has produced, with Eno's taut textural background sensitively augmenting Holland's staccato verse. Beyond those, we get a minute-long lite-industrial curio, a <i>pro forma</i> instrumental, and a couple less memorable fusions of orotund speech and crepuscular atmosphere.</p>
<p>Poetry writing and poetry recitation are two very different talents that don't always-- or even often-- coexist. Inverting classical music's emphasis on the concert hall over the recording, modern Western poetry favors the written word over the oral performance, which has become something you do mainly in order to sell books, regardless of whether or not you're any good at it. It's a weird cultural construct: Imagine if musicians were expected to promote their work by juggling. As a result, even poetry lovers may emit a long-suffering groan at the prospect of attending yet another reading. But there are things oratory can do that text simply can't, and Holland exploits them to his advantage, especially on the title track. One of them is homophonic ambiguity: Is he saying ""speed and weight"" or ""speed and wait?"" Both concepts are compelling, especially in flickering juxtaposition. Biting off words one by one, Holland creates hard enjambments (""Men… shake… hands"") that deliver doses of meaning, each altering the last, as if from a time-release capsule. If all of this sounds more geared toward Eno completists and poetry fans than the general listener, that's about right.</p></div>"|16005.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16005-panic-of-looking/|5.9|Brian Howe

You will either think the alias is awesome or awful. There is no in-between. Yet it's instantly memorable and more fitting than anything that references a Jack Black/Lucha Libre vehicle has any right to be.</p>
<p>Since Rick Rubin tried to create the ""worst shit ever,"" rap has a long history of the highbrow-lowbrow game. Or what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface Killah</a> called the ""smart dumb cat."" Robinson is Nacho and Picasso, part fast food, part real deal. He is the hardcore hood nerd, the walking talking paradox writ large. Or as he describes himself on <i>For the Glory</i>: ""Think like George Carlin/ Dress like Carlton/ Ball like Damon/ And wild like Marlon.""</p>
<p>Nacho openly claims he's an arrogant asshole, not to be trusted, a bridge burner, and a numbnuts. He dedicates his orgies to Dionysus. His album cover is a picture of him riding a horse dressed as Sir Lance-A-Lot, while flanked by a Harry Potter castle and three nude goddesses. The latter continue Sir Mix-A-Lot's proud <i>Emerald City</i> tradition.</p>
<p>Picasso proves that you don't need to practice the art of storytelling when you've mastered the art of saying nothing. And <i>For the Glory</i> is basically a paean to girls, guns, tattoos, chronic, and comics. There is an entire song, ""Marvel"", wherein Picasso basically compares himself to every summer blockbuster of the last decade. While it should feel like second-rate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2751-mf-doom/"" target=""_blank"">MF Doom</a>, Nacho spits slick and (partially) revelatory internal rhymes. He repeats, ""Smoking/ Reading comic books,"" until it becomes mantra, like the kid from the cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/"" target=""_blank"">OutKast</a>'s <i>ATLiens</i> grown up.</p>
<p>If anything, <i>For the Glory</i> is a snub-nosed self-portrait. Picasso condenses information into one or two bars with the ease of a 1990s 5 Percent rapper. ""He's been a bad guy/ Since his dad died."" The self-aware scumbag redeemed through his honesty and arrant goofiness. On ""Moor Gang"", he describes his life as ""Big butts and boobs/ Blunts and booze/ Watching <i>Ninja Turtles II: Secret of the Ooze</i>/ With my Steven Urkel frames and custom-made shoes."" And he even has the restraint to refrain from a Vanilla Ice punchline.</p>
<p>That's the thing about Picasso, he knows how to vividly render an image and largely avoid cliché. Even when he resorts to the tired mobster/rapper dualities of ""Benjamin Segal"", he avoids the obvious Tony Montana trap. Circa 2011, the norm is rappers so tatted-up they might as well be married to Sandra Bullock. But Picasso is one of the few who makes it seem like more than fashion accessory. On ""Sweaters"", the self-proclaimed ""tat in the hat"" describes his body as a timeline and his face as something ageless. Later, he says he's inked like a Rorschach blot and a fourth-grade desk.</p>
<p>Half of the record captures Picasso as the affable stoner drawling in a seen-it-all baritone about 1980s professional wrestlers and characters from <i>Half Baked</i>. The guy who would insert a lesser remembered clip of <i>White Men Can't Jump </i>just for the fuck of it.<i> </i>The other side is the ruthless hustler whose car ""looks like Iceland,"" who lashes out against ""bitches who say that he looks like Chris Brown."" The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"" target=""_blank"">Black Flag</a>-shirted, bare knuckle-gypsy, who shares his dead dad's love of anarchy. The end result is language-drunk and spliff-lit disorientation in the cold vein of vintage <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/937-camron/"" target=""_blank"">Cam'ron</a>, late-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a>, and the post-Def Jux disorderly conduct of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29952-mr-muthafuckin-exquire/"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire</a>.</p>
<p>Picasso references his internal turmoil but never delves too deep. Nor does he need to. In his worldview, there is little nostalgia for the past or dreams of the future-- just the weary gray of the hustle. Lyrically, Seattle doesn't factor in much, other than a stray reference to being from the city where they ""bust heads and clean clocks."" Thankfully, producers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29657-blue-sky-black-death/"" target=""_blank"">Blue Sky Black Death</a> and Raised by Wolves provide the requisite Pacific Northwestern pallor, providing moody beats that suture ""Stepfather Factory""-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"" target=""_blank"">El-P</a> to the mercury float of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>.</p>
<p>During a year in which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28847-shabazz-palaces/"" target=""_blank"">Shabazz Palaces</a> has earned Seattle hip-hop more buzz since the last time slackers wore flannel, Picasso grabs his fair share of the spotlight. <i>For the Glory</i> is one of the best rap debuts of the year, one that simultaneously manages to say everything but reveal nothing. Or as George Carlin would have said: Language is just a tool for concealing the truth.</p></div>"|15976.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15976-for-the-glory/|7.9|Jeff Weiss

Ever since, the reconstituted Only-lead group, staffed by a rotating cast of punk-rock yeomen, has traipsed across the globe, delivering a Misfits-like product. It's not that the Only-Misfits are terrible-- the music hews closely to the group's original Buddy Holly-meets-B-movie template, albeit with an added dash of metal riffage-- but it is goofier. Without Danzig's combustible presence, the band softened into predictability, their previous menace petering out into <i>Scooby Doo</i> villain-hood. In 1999, they even popped up in a WCW cage match (and got creamed).</p>
<p>Misfits' first album of new material in 12 years, <i>The Devil's Rain</i><span>,</span> finds the band-- Only, former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"" target=""_blank"">Black Flag</a> guitarist Dez Cadena, and Murphy's Law drummer Eric Arce-- coldly chugging through the motions. In their original incarnation, Misfits made blistering music out of seemingly contradictory impulses. They were muscle heads who bashed out primitive rhythms but sang like third-string crooners and obsessed over B-movie imagery. The sound was aggressive, but romantic in its own tacky, zonked-out way.</p>
<p>But nothing on <i>The Devil's Rain </i>growls with the unschooled simplicity of the early years-- songs like ""Come Back"" and ""Horror Business"" pitched and yawed on violent, stone-age rhythms. Only, who has taken over frontman duties, just doesn't have the bite in his voice. Where Danzig deftly toed a line between crooning and barking, Only strays too far into the latter category. On ""Curse of the Mummy's Hand"", he sounds like Pat Boone doing Halloween karaoke. His songwriting is largely driven by straight-faced retellings of midnight movie clichés that come off silly rather than sinister. Like the previous Misfits Mk. II records-- <i>American Psycho</i> and <i>Famous Monsters</i>-- the production is notched up to contemporary pop-punk standards, but added polish makes the music feel remote and impersonal.</p>
<p>It didn't have to be this way. Since the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan have lost some of their cachet as punk rock cannon fodder, but Misfits' go-to protagonists, the undead, are having something of a renaissance as of late. Between <i>The Walking Dead</i>, <i>True Blood</i>, and <i>Twilight</i>, horror business is good. The Misfits' schtick should stand the test of time. But <i>The Devil's Rain</i> makes supernatural feel like fairly workaday stuff.</p></div>"|16015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16015-the-misfits-the-devils-rain/|3.9|Aaron Leitko

In interviews he's garrulous and outspoken, ostensibly brimming with confidence, yet plagued by insecurity. All that self-doubt manifests itself in his solo project, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5633-atlas-sound/"">Atlas Sound</a>, where he often sounds small, alone, and cut adrift from the world. At times Cox seems at odds with himself, but dig deeper and there's usually a thread running through his real-world activities and the ideas he obsesses over when recording.</p>
<p>And he's always recording. Last year, Cox released four albums of Atlas Sound demos as the free-download <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14996-bedroom-databank-vols-1-4/"">Bedroom Databank</a></i> series. It's a wonder he can keep track of all his work, but one of his biggest talents-- aside from his rich vein of form as a songwriter-- is as an editor. Not only does he know exactly what to release officially and what to preserve as a blog-only treat for fans, he's also intuitively adept at compartmentalizing material into his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"">Deerhunter</a> and Atlas Sound worlds.</p>
<p>Despite the separation, those two modes aren't mutually exclusive, and it's always interesting to see how Cox's two guises feed off each other while retaining strong individual identities. The last Deerhunter album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14681-halcyon-digest/"">Halcyon Digest</a></i>, ended with ""He Would Have Laughed"", built around a spaghetti-like loop of synthesized noise. It mirrors a trick that's revisited just a few songs into <i>Parallax, </i>on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12422-te-amo/"">""Te Amo""</a>. Here, Cox leans on a repeating pattern, then pulls away from it by testing the elasticity of his vocal range, stretching into a gruff register he's rarely tried out before. Atlas Sound often functions this way, taking baby steps on the road to evolution and leaving traces of previous material to ground the listener. The two constants are Cox's fascination with ambient music and the unabashed sadness at the heart of his writing. ""When you're down, you're always down,"" he croons on ""Te Amo"".</p>
<p>Crooning has held Cox's interest for a while now. Versions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8980-hank-williams/"">Hank Williams</a>' ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodgers_and_Hart"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rodgers and Hart</a> standard ""Blue Moon"" appeared on his <a href=""http://deerhuntertheband.blogspot.com/2008/04/atlas-sound-covers-two-songs-for-my-dad.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> back in 2008, and his cover of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Meek"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joe Meek</a>'s <a href=""http://deerhuntertheband.blogspot.com/2008/02/atlas-sound-orange-ohms-glow-ep-some.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Valley of the Saroos""</a> is one of his most impressive giveaways. Lately, Cox has been playing around with image, something he hasn't attempted much since his early dress-wearing days in Deerhunter, and he appears to have settled on a hybrid of Meek-ian high hair and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>'s plastic emulation of the rock'n'roll era circa <i>Let's Dance</i>. On the Mick Rock-shot cover of <i>Parallax</i> he's even depicted clutching a vintage 1950s microphone. So it's appropriate that this record begins with ""The Shakes"", where Cox casts himself as an idol who's grown bored of fame, money, and hangers-on masquerading as friends. It echoes Bowie's weary exasperation at the clamor for fame in the documentary <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKILbensN6I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cracked Actor</a></i>, where he rides around middle America in a limo and compares himself to a fly swimming around in his glass of milk.</p>
<p>That link to Bowie loops back to the <i>Young Americans</i>-style sax solo on ""Coronado"" from <i>Halcyon Digest</i>, further indicating how one Cox project informs his others. But his omnivorous approach to music history, and the restraint that keeps him from drawing too much from his heroes' own sounds, makes <i>Parallax</i> a constantly shifting delight. In the past, Cox's affinity for masked vocals allowed him to keep his guard up, stopping listeners from encroaching on his malaise. Here, he uses fewer vocal effects, and the gentle balladry of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12473-modern-aquatic-nightsongs/"" target=""_blank"">""Modern Aquatic Nightsongs""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12290-terra-incognita/"">""Terra Incognita""</a> benefit greatly from it. This cleaner approach to his art demonstrates his growing confidence as a singer and songwriter and feels more involving.</p>
<p>But that's only part of the picture. Because Cox likes to confound, surprise, and keep his audience guessing, one of his shiniest pop moments yet lies at the center of this record. ""Mona Lisa"" is a jaunty piece of melancholia-tinged guitar rock, hung up somewhere between the livelier moments on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"">R.E.M.</a>'s <i>Green</i> and the rural tug at the heart of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2304-the-kinks/"">Kinks</a>' best material. Comparing this track with the deliberately jaded lyrical framework of ""The Shakes"" highlights one of the most fascinating juxtapositions about Cox; he's so well versed in music history that he knows he'll hate the pitfalls that await him if proper fame comes beckoning, and yet his inclination toward deeply accessibile songwriting and infernally catchy pop melodies might drive him in that direction anyway. There's also more bridge-building on ""Mona Lisa"" and the garage-y ""My Angel Is Broken"", where he sounds confident and vulnerable at the same time, drawing some of that swagger he possesses in real life into his art.</p>
<p><i>Parallax</i> feels like a more complete work than any other Atlas Sound record, with the differences between the songs less distinct and everything flowing together more naturally. ""Quick Canal"" was a standout on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13619-logos/"">Logos</a></i> but it also stood alone, feeling like a neat one-off collaboration with a hero (in that case, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a> singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28928-laetitia-sadier/"">Laetitia Sadier</a>) that didn't readily come into focus in the overall picture. There are no such loose strands here, and the closing ""Lightworks"" ends the album wonderfully with a tremoloed guitar shuddering against Cox's hankering vocal line and uncanny pop nouse. It's another testament to his editing skills; he can effortlessly balance a sizable load of contrasting styles and slot them together like it's the most natural thing in the world. That lightness of touch is on display throughout this album, providing greater gravitas to Cox's brittle self-examination. <i>Parallax</i> still makes him sound small, alone, and cut adrift from the world, but the way these songs breathe suggests he's more comfortable in his own skin, allowing him to draw his audience closer than ever.</p>

Listening to hours of Kurt Vile, you get the impression that he once discovered the Neil Young lyric, ""Though my problems are meaningless/ That don't make them go away"" from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKgj1FNToWY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""On the Beach""</a>, decided to lie down in it a while, and just never left.</p>
<p>Like other cultishly obsessive songwriters, however, Vile manages to repeat himself without strictly repeating himself. Images and phrases cycle through his lyrics like tumbling socks in a dryer-- he mumbles the phrase ""two packs of red apples"" on both ""Red Apples"" from 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12953-constant-hitmaker-god-is-saying-this-to-you/"" target=""_blank"">God Is Saying This to You</a></i>, and again on <i>Halo</i>'s  ""Runner Ups"". His releases often feature alternate versions of the same song, which happens here with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12550-lifes-a-beach/"" target=""_blank"">""Life's a Beach""</a> and ""(so outta reach)"", the second a faint echo of the first's muted shuffle. These are the sorts of subliminal tugs that map out the contours of a universe, and Vile has carefully built one with small tools-- his mutter, a bottomless cavern of reverb, and glimmering tangles of guitars-- and painted it a dozen shades of steel-blue and watery gray.</p>
<p><i>So Outta Reach</i>, then, is a dispatch, another stop along a journey, and it's as good a place to tune into his frequency as any. ""The Creature"", the opening song, spins out another fragile variation on the wearily bemused blues he's perfected.  His acoustic fingerpicking remains stunning, a narcotic blur of voicing that recalls his friend and former touring partner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3669-jack-rose/"" target=""_blank"">Jack Rose</a>. Like Rose, or like early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Elliott Smith</a>, Vile's playing retunes your hearing to the limitless possibilities of the plain old acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>Fingerpicking is, of course, a skill acquired only through endless hours hunched over the guitar; it's no coincidence, perhaps, that Vile's lyrics speak overwhelmingly of friends lost, the dull pain of being left behind, and the sad savor of solitude. <i>So Outta Reach</i> includes a cover of Bruce Springsteen's ""Downbound Train"", blanketed in stoner-rock distortion, and its hard-luck, ""now I work at a car wash,"" story folds seamlessly into Vile's landscape. But a careful study of his lyrics turns up little Zen-stoner nuggets of wisdom, like this one from ""Life's a Beach"": ""Life's a while."" The line reminds me of Chevy Chase advising that ""a donut with no hole is a Danish"" in <i>Caddyshack</i>, and suggests there's a sense of humor lurking beneath Vile's drooping curtain of hair.</p>
<p>Dependability is an unglamorous virtue to champion, yet at this point I reach for Vile's music like a glass of water. There's simple joy in the knowledge that falling for one Kurt Vile song practically ensures I will love a dozen others. I don't often find myself thinking about Vile when his music is not playing, but his music nurses a profound ache, and he's now made enough of it that it's become a whole corner to visit, a unique transmission that feels like its own sentient being. As an artist, it's hard to aim higher than that.</p></div>"|15964.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15964-kurt-vile-so-outta-reach-ep/|7.9|Jayson Greene

In many ways, his story is the story of the label itself. Much like DFA's core group, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a>, the ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3805-six-finger-satellite/"" target=""_blank"">Six Finger Satellite</a> musician came to dance music from an indie/punk rock background. He released a string of well-received 12""s-- his first predating LCD's breakout <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xG4oFny2Pk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Losing My Edge""</a> and beaten onto the tracks only by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3529-the-rapture/"" target=""_blank"">the Rapture</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HP04nfUi4g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""House of Jealous Lovers""</a>-- before eventually maturing into a solid album artist. These transitions from rock to electronic, and from DJ-oriented 12"" to albums, are also the tensions that animate the label.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it's been interesting to see how MacLean has responded to releasing one of the label's strongest, and perhaps least expected albums, 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12853-the-future-will-come/"" target=""_blank"">The Future Will Come</a></i>. First, he offered the house classicism of his 2010 <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14165-dj-kicks/"" target=""_blank"">DJ-Kicks</a></i> mix; now we have the previously released odds-and-ends of <i>Everybody Get Close</i>, a collection that both dimly mirrors <i>Future</i> and shows MacLean stretching into the production of more faceless but more functional dance tracks.</p>
<p>Like <i>The Future Will Come</i>, this record's varied electro tracks are anchored by one awesome 10-minute workout. Here it's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14079-feel-so-good/"" target=""_blank"">""Feel So Good""</a>-- with its endlessly building house pianos, rolling background percussion, and Nancy Whang's clipped come-ons, it almost reads like a dub version of his 2008 single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/13265-happy-house/"" target=""_blank"">""Happy House""</a>. (In fact, it makes the actual version of ""Happy House"" that's included here-- an alternately wan and annoying nu-Balearic rework by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5730-cut-copy/"" target=""_blank"">Cut Copy</a>-- feel more superfluous than it already is.)</p>
<p>Two remixes of <i>Future</i>'s lone ballad ""Human Disaster"" appear as well-- the Holmes Price version holds onto MacLean's regretful singing and heavy, hanging piano chords, but sets them against trilling synths and an old-school electro beat; Jee Day smears the piano chords into a haze of reverb then brings them back as a muffled loop that echoes the triplet pattern of ""Happy House"" amid an unnecessarily busy rhythm track. The album is bookended with the two cuts that sound most like <i>Future</i> B-sides, the vocal electro of ""Find a Way"" and its vocodered echo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12403-everybody-get-close/"" target=""_blank"">""Everybody Get Close""</a>.</p>
<p>The tracks that fare best are those that veer furthest away from <i>Future</i>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7221-the-human-league/"" target=""_blank"">Human League</a>-meets-house template. For instance, ""Let's Talk About Me"" is a squealing, percolating acid track with pitched-up vocals reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22489-zomby/"" target=""_blank"">Zomby</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6_Oltb852o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fuck Mixing, Let's Dance""</a> (and therefore of a whole swath of circa 1992 rave). ""X2"" is a dark, sonar-pinging track that could pass for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6175-shit-robot/"" target=""_blank"">Shit Robot</a>. ""Deviant Device"" is a floating bit of dubby ambient techno that slowly unfolds over nine minutes to become one of the most enjoyable tracks on the collection.</p>
<p>Sadly, <i>Everybody Get Close</i> doesn't function as a benchmark of MacLean's between-album progress, as it collects tracks dating back at far as four years. Some of these feel like scraps and sketches, others like the B-sides they are-- which is fine when the scraps are this frequently exciting-- but given the range of his output so far, what would be most satisfying would be to get a glimpse of where MacLean's heading next.</p></div>"|16001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16001-the-juan-maclean-everybody-get-close/|7.0|Eric Grandy

Since its founding in 1984, artists like Model 500, Joey Beltram and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a> have roosted there; its <a href=""http://www.fantazia.org.uk/recordlabels/images/r&amp;srecords.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">logo</a> was <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2009/strut046cd.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">parodied</a> by London's queer disco party Horse Meat Disco. When the label returned from an absence in 2006 and set up shop in London, bass music was a natural focus. Concentrating on singles and EPs, the label has since released some of the most adventurous material by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27930-untold/"" target=""_blank"">Untold</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29381-lone/"" target=""_blank"">Lone</a>. <i>IOTDXI</i> is a 2xCD/3xLP compilation that collects highlights from the past 18 months and, as is the custom these days, presents 10 exclusive tracks as well.</p>
<p>Everyone (including myself) has pontificated about the spreading tendrils of bass music, but sometimes it feels less like evolution and more like insects scattering after a rock's been lifted. The fervor with which the bass community has adopted deep Chicago house, Berlin minimal, and Detroit techno has begun to feel like an abandonment of purpose. What's most refreshing about <i>IOTDXI</i> is listening to a group of artists who have largely clung to quick syncopation, mildly aggressive bass, and arrested vocal samples.</p>
<p>High praise: The highlights disc contains a handful of songs so familiar they threaten tedium. Blake's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11907-cmyk/"" target=""_blank"">""CMYK""</a>, Lone's ""Coreshine Voodoo"", and Pariah's ""Orpheus"" form a potent trio in the middle of the first disc; anyone who hasn't worn their bytes thin on mixes and DJ sets the past two years is encouraged to do so here. The disc is better, perhaps, at reminding us of the young talent R&amp;S has put to wax. Cloud Boat offers sighing dubstep heartbreak on ""Lions on the Beach"" (and is noticeably absent from the exclusives disc), while the lightly whipped synth-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29552-vondelpark/"" target=""_blank"">Vondelpark</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15858-camels/"" target=""_blank"">""Camels""</a> feels refreshing at the close of the first disc.</p>
<p>Appending an exclusives disc to a retrospective has become common practice for electronic music labels, but I wonder if a game-theory course or two wouldn't help them better incentivize their artists. Knowing that the label will be judged, not the artists, seems like a surefire way to collect the fourth-best track sitting on every producer's hard drive. (Another problem, of course, is that these exclusives sit opposite the producers' best by design.) R&amp;S has enough talent on the roster to remain appealing. Lone places piano house in a blender on ""Cobra"". Blawan returns to form after his disappointing ""What You Do With What You Have"" single, offering aggressive, hoofed dubstep. The curious Space Dimension Controller apply lush, lounge-y tempos to analog video game patter.</p>
<p>You'd be right to assume that your collection doesn't need <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>'s gassy remix of ""Orpheus"" or the Chain's tech-y, mundane ""Suffer for Your Art"". We can safely write these off as consequences of format, because the overriding message that <i>IOTDXI</i> delivers is that R&amp;S is a healthy, engaged label equally capable of housing established talents and coaxing out fresh ones. If there's no explicit sense of direction or momentum, perhaps that's because R&amp;S understands permanence more than most of its peers.</p></div>"|16007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16007-iotdxi/|7.1|Andrew Gaerig

The record-- full of scrambled sounds you recognize from elsewhere-- feels like it could exist in a parallel universe. The sensation of this music, which does have a peculiar thrill to it, can also be a frustrating riddle: At times, you'll want to dive into the waveforms and pull the fragments back into a right order and find some sense.<i> </i></p>
<p>The collection's probably<i> </i>more engaging a concept or idea than straight-up listen, but there is fun to be had in the way the beats spin your head. Less concerned with the relentless drive into the future than some of his peers, Patten's forging a sound off the beaten path, cherry-picking past sounds and twisting them.</p>
<p>Much of the record finds Patten looking toward 1990s Warp acts. ""Blush Mosaic"" takes <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a>'s icy synths and softly pushes fast-forward, revving something glacial into something manic-- the aural equivalent of a stop-motion nature video. Vocals drift in and out as rhythms weave around each other. It's one of the record's strongest statements, and a track where Patten's sometimes unfocused energy comes together to make something engaging, trippy, and destroyed.</p>
<p>On ""Fire Dream"" there are shades of <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/3328-plaid/"" target=""_blank"">Plaid</a> and <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"" target=""_blank"">Autechre</a>, especially in the pale analog synths. Patten matches that patchwork with powdery hi-hats and head-knocking beats. It's not only piecemeal scraps of Warp influence in the music, though-- there's a general influence in attitude and approach. Even the baiting LP title seems like the kind of brick wall <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Richard D. James</a> or Chris Morris would erect. That approach carries over to the source material: Nothing feels too holy for Patten to throw into the blender.</p>
<p>On the strongest moments, like ""Blush Mosaic"" and ""Fire Dream"", the bent circuitry is visceral and engaging, but there are instances where those loose rhythmic threads don't knot together so well. Take the motion-sick ""Out the Coast"", where the beats collapse into each other and don't quite blend with the rest of the action. It feels like there's something good buried within, but the effect is jarring and disorientating (not pleasantly so).</p>
<p>A problem with his whirlwind approach is that each idea's so quickly processed it can leave the results feeling too breathless or rushed. A nice moment passes so quickly that it immediately becomes a dot on the horizon. There also isn't a great deal of contrast on the record. And not a lot of warmth. It's here Patten strikes the biggest contrast with the artists he might be referencing or reminding you of: A great deal of music on that IDM spectrum that Patten picks apart has heart to it. On his <i>Come to Daddy</i> EP, for instance, Aphex Twin closes the record with the gorgeous <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLHtV_S2HZw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""IZ-US""</a>. Likewise, <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/3921-squarepusher/"" target=""_blank"">Squarepusher</a>, at his busiest on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSnhXGVTdbk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Port Rhombus""</a>, pulls away the rhythmic carpet to reveal a lilting, lush guitar. There are no moments like this for Patten, and for all its movement, <i>GLAQJO XAACSSO</i> feels a little frozen.</p></div>"|16008.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16008-patten-glaqjo-xaacsso/|6.7|Hari Ashurst

This has remained true as the music industry has changed and it has remained true as DJs-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>, David Guetta, Deadmau5-- have risen to pop-culture prominence. It's why so much of the coverage of an artist like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"" target=""_blank"">Robyn</a> focuses on her smallness and approachability; it is not the norm. On his debut album, Bristol-based producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22494-joker/"" target=""_blank"">Joker</a> (Liam McLean) wants to be a hero. <i>The Vision</i>, arriving after years of delays and false starts, is not for the industrial streets of Bristol, London's maturing club culture, or the small pockets of hyper-aware American undergrounders eager for bombast that doesn't result in our getting wedgied in a mosh pit. All of those scenes are made to feel small next to the righteous blockbuster-ing of <i>The Vision</i>, an album so impressed with itself that there's little need for the listener to be so.</p>
<p>It's not hard to figure out how Joker arrived here. As part of the ""<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/jun/12/guido-joker-gemmy-purple-bristol"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">purple</a>"" (post-) dubstep movement, Joker (along with Gemmy and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28086-guido/"" target=""_blank"">Guido</a>) suggested that the end-game for dubstep's engorged bass rumble did not have to be masculine aggression. He unleashed a nearly bulletproof string of singles and for well over a year did seem heroic-- his superpower a Magneto-like control of your mid-range dial, his age proof that there were skills yet to harness. His breakout came as dubstep was graduating from pervasive force to ubiquitous cultural presence (in England) and seemed to cement his status as a comer.</p>
<p>That <i>The Vision</i> is more pop-oriented, more streamlined, and more self aware won't be a surprise to anyone who has paid attention. It paints the picture of a producer who not only missed his moment but whose verve and craft dissolved as he waited. <i>The Vision</i> buckles, repeatedly, under a mass of unwieldy guest appearances, pandering pop moves, and Joker's ever-present, oxygen-eating synths. An album meant to display a producer's power and confidence-- from the title to the cover art on down-- instead reveals a reliance on formula and a crippling indecisiveness. Grime, R&amp;B, stadium pop, and dubstep all come in for the most tepid of updates.</p>
<p>Most of the collaborators-- on board to tease out those genre plays-- are ill-chosen and marginally talented. With the exception of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"" target=""_blank"">Jessie Ware</a> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27635-santigold/"" target=""_blank"">Santigold</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29414-katy-b/"" target=""_blank"">Katy B</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a>, right down to her bigger voice and handful of kickass tunes), they serve as haughty ciphers, funneling heaps of entitlement and no small amount of paranoia into these tracks. Silas, on the functionally widescreen ""Slaughter House"": ""They wrap you up in plastic and ship it to the store."" Who? 4AD? (More damning still, from Silas: ""You can hang around and see what the hook brings."" I can!) ""On My Mind"" is ""Love in this Wal-Mart"" for the post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"" target=""_blank"">Timbaland</a> set. It features the line, ""Rumor has it that you want a man with a big di-di-[<i>ed. note: wait for it</i>] digital following."" This is presented without a hint of humor or irony; somewhere <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27233-the-lonely-island/"" target=""_blank"">Lonely Island</a>'s number three is slapping his forehead. Joker's most fruitful and charming vocal collaboration-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12246-music-4am-ft-buggsy/"" target=""_blank"">""Music (4am)""</a>-- perplexingly misses the cut.</p>
<p>What's most distressing is that <i>The Vision</i> doesn't sound like Joker's version of R&amp;B and hip-hop ruined by less talented collaborators; it sounds like Joker's version of the same ruined by Joker. He has strip-mined his chewy, mid-range melodies for their largess, applying it liberally to standard verse-chorus-bridge structures. Removing the cast of self-aggrandizing twits from ""Back in the Days"" doesn't get you to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11400-digidesign/"" target=""_blank"">""Digidesign""</a>; the children's choir on ""Lost"" is a far cry from the whirling-dervish-house of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RadZTuZEKlM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Snake Eater""</a>. The best ""classic"" Joker track included is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11860-tron/"" target=""_blank"">""Tron""</a>, an early-2010 offering that preceded the unrelated Hollywood remake that you've already forgotten about and was thought at the time to be among his weakest tracks.</p>
<p>The comparison I keep coming back to for <i>The Vision</i> is Canibus' <i>Can-I-Bus</i>, American hip-hop's nuclear option for unrealized potential and perceived slights. Like <i>Can-I-Bus</i>, <i>The Vision</i> required a perfect storm of bad advice, arrogance, and wretched timing. It irks that a series of Joker's peers-- among them <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28873-sbtrkt/"" target=""_blank"">SBTRKT</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15937-glass-swords/"" target=""_blank"">Rustie</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29277-magnetic-man/"" target=""_blank"">Magnetic Man</a>-- have established a blueprint for bass producers looking to go pop without sacrificing direction or personality. On ""Slaughter House"" Silas finishes his rhyme: ""They wrap you up in plastic and ship it to the store/ But deep in your bones you know you were made for something more."" On an album of terrible, throwaway lines, this is the worst: Joker was absolutely made for this. He arrived fully formed, a shy kid buried in synthesizers and video games, born for music. Whatever has transpired since, <i>The Vision</i> seems to be exactly what Joker wants: UK pop&amp;B of the vainest and most vacuous possible variety.</p></div>"|16003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16003-the-vision/|4.2|Andrew Gaerig

After his 2009 Interscope debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13695-attention-deficit/"" target=""_blank"">Attention Deficit</a></i> bricked, selling a chastening 28,000 copies its first week, most presumed he would disappear soundlessly,  like his fellow 2009 XXL Freshmen classmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27731-asher-roth/"" target=""_blank"">Asher Roth</a> and  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27563-charles-hamilton/"" target=""_blank"">Charles Hamilton</a>. He had failed to become a serious pop  star, represent his D.C. hometown, or smuggle social consciousness  into the rap mainstream-- his three bedrock campaign promises. But instead of disappearing, Wale caught the eye of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick  Ross</a>, just as the Miami kingpin was transforming into commercial  rap's all-devouring center of gravity, and climbed aboard Rozay's ascendant Maybach Music Group. <i>Ambition</i>, the result of a pairing nobody saw coming, inaugurates the curious second phase of Wale Folarin's increasingly fascinating career.</p>
<p>The  record is a testament to the  virtue in the album's title. Never say Wale doesn't learn from mistakes: Everything that  dragged down <i>Attention Deficit</i>, from  hipster-baiting to its bewildering guest roster, has been jettisoned,  along with introspection and any lingering modicum of respect for women. On <i>Ambition</i>, Wale is reborn as an unrepentantly shallow  strip-club rapper, and the production is a gleaming phalanx of freshly minted beats from Ross' MMG assembly line.  The album is unmistakably a product of Planet Boss, the lurid neon kingdom of B-movie saxes and cartoon excess in which Rick Ross has built his empire. And <i>Ambition</i> provides a remarkably effective demonstration in how a shpritz of Planet Boss can jumpstart a flagging rapper's fortunes.</p>
<p>Wale's complete persona 180 will strike his original fanbase as repellantly cynical, and there is something vaguely unsavory and disorienting in the eagerness with which he embraces his new role. But it turns out that many of the gifts that got him noticed in the first place-- a nimble tongue, a high-stepping flow-- lend themselves as well to flossy nonsense about watches and women as they did to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpE77KEHSmE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">examining the sociopolitical implications of  Soundscan</a>. And <i>Ambition</i> is a high-velocity parade of flossy nonsense, with an extremely dense ratio of Headslaps-Per-Minute: ""I'm sort of like Socrates in a Prada T""; ""I aspire  for awesome/ That requires some flossin'""; ""Fuck rap, I get pussy off of  haiku."" There is a Sandra Bullock namedrop that references the 1992  sci-fi comedy <i>Love Potion No. 9</i>. Everything is fast-moving, breezily entertaining, and patently ridiculous.</p>
<p>Even  swilling champagne at the winners' table, however, Wale remains  something less than ""fun."" He  always had the gift for  seeing the negative that you might expect from  someone who structured an  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11963-the-mixtape-about-nothing/"" target=""_blank"">entire mixtape</a> around clips of old <i>Seinfeld</i> dialogue,  and it rears its head in a  lot of ranting about silencing his critics. ""Sippin Moscato with models, havin exotic  dishes/ But it don't mean shit unless I know that my genre respected,""  he gripes on ""Don't Hold Your Applause"". And his smooth-loverman  approach, bluntly, needs fine-tuning: on the treacly slow jam ""Lotus Flower  Bomb"", he offers the hilariously stilted compliment ""Took you forever to  get dressed/ I acknowledge your effort."" Uh, thanks, Wale!</p>
<p>The  production, however, from a cannily sourced collection of lesser-known  beatmakers and big names, sounds uniformly incredible: <i>Ambition</i> is the first sign that Maybach Music  Group has flowered into a full-blown production house. Mark Henry, who  has produced some sledgehammer beats for Fat Joe, gives Wale the  fleet-footed ""Miami Nights"", which pipes in some woolly sax from Ross' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHRWvaj35FM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Maybach Music II""</a>, and the window-fogging funk of ""Double M Genius"". Toomp chops  up strings like early-millennium <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7025-just-blaze/"" target=""_blank"">Just Blaze</a> on ""Legendary"". MMG stalwart  Tone P serves up, among others, the brain-rattling ""Chain  Music"". The album will sound devastating pounding out of passing Escalades, and it is currently slated to pound out of many; early estimates peg <i>Ambition</i>'s first-week sales at around 170,000.</p>
<p>Those numbers will surely provide a certain vindication for Wale, but above all they signal a triumph for Maybach Music. When Ross signed  Wale, I joked that Rozay must have lost his taste for money. But his  imprint has taken a temperamental rapper whose name had become  synonymous with commercial kryptonite and molded him into a passable pop  star. Listening to <i>Ambitio</i>n, I began to wonder what  delirious commercial miracles Bawse might cook up for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28441-pill/"" target=""_blank"">Pill</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30022-meek-mill/"" target=""_blank"">Meek Mill</a>,  and the other seemingly unmarketable rappers on his roster: Meek Mill with a No. 1? Pill with a gold plaque? Who knows. What <i>Ambition</i> proves beyond a doubt, however, is that commercial rap, right now, is Ross' world. People like Wale, if they are lucky, get to live in it.</p></div>"|16002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16002-wale-ambition/|6.7|Jayson Greene

Or as one DJ put it to me, edits arose from the pleasure principle, that ""when you hear something great, you want it to continue."" Early disco DJs used them as secret weapons for their dancefloors, as did hip-hop's pioneers, spinning familiar songs into alternate universes, but after the heyday of Chicago house masters like Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles, the edit as a DJ tool faded from view.</p>
<p>While London's DJ Harvey dropped his series of ""Black Cock"" edits in the mid-1990s, it was when Detroit producer <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/soundsignature"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Theo Parrish</a>'s self-deemed ""ugly"" edits (complete with slapdash spray-painted labels) lurched into view at the turn of the 21st century that the trend came back in full force. Rather than resort to using scalpel and cutting block, the technology allowed dancefloor professionals like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/"" target=""_blank"">Prins Thomas</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Pilooski"" target=""_blank"">Pilooski</a>, and even <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Unknown-Artist-Feels-So-Good-Up-And-Down-Beep/release/1550678%C2%A0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">James Murphy</a> to drop such reconfigured tunes. It also allowed newbies and bedroom DJs alike to make their own edits, albeit to diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Theo Parrish's limited disco edits remain in high demand, getting bootlegged repeatedly (a bootleg of a bootleg?) and going for ludicrous sums online. And while this collection has neither ""Ugly Edits"" nor Theo Parrish's name anywhere on the art, the handy 2xCD set compiles the first eight editions of those edits released over a three-year period. It's not just an affordable compendium of the wiggly, playful, grimy, and irreducible disco edits the man had his way with, but also a fine gateway into his wholly idiosyncratic soundworld, suggesting a common ground between Larry Levan and Brion Gysin.</p>
<p>Always an inscrutable music-maker, with productions eschewing the distinctions erected between house, jazz, funk, avant-garde electronic, and soul music, all of Parrish's traits can be heard in the perfect opening track, a woozy, spiraling edit of Jill Scott's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M-_ZqR2JyU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Slowly Surely""</a> from her 2000 debut album. Starting with a glitching CD, tocking drum machine, and a voicemail from the singer herself, she thanks him for a CD that she has yet to listen to. She talks of her over-protective manager but that polite backpedal transforms into a gently cycling whispered plaint: ""I just don't know where I should go."" Pillowy soft chords lift and drift back down; a woodblock and some other random percussive moments get foregrounded only to dissipate. Yet somehow 12 of the most effervescent minutes in house music have surely drifted past.</p>
<p>The set's bread and butter is in how Parrish dices and lengthens funk and soul cuts by acts such as the Dells, Minnie Riperton, Willie Hutch, Funkadelic, and Kool &amp; the Gang. He takes Sylvester's ""Dance"" and boils it down to rubbery bassline, incessant hi-hat, and a pickup line for its first three minutes before the dancefloor release comes. In teasing out Sugarhill Gang's late-period joint <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6jnMTwsCp0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hot Hot Summer Day""</a>, he lobs off all their wack rapping and instead elevates the melted-butter backing vocals from the last third of the song, spinning a nine-minute epic out of it.</p>
<p>Which is not to say he emphasizes only the bright, dancefloor-friendly aspects of tracks. When he takes incidental music from Quincy Jones's score for <i>The Color Purple</i>, a clanging polyrhythmic vocal chant dissolves into a disquieting stab of strings. In reworking slick boogie band GQ's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hKmIxhspsA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lies""</a>, he offsets a loop about ""a party going on"" with a man agonizing, ""I got to know why,"" to a cheating woman.</p>
<p>On the easily recognizable Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' Philly-Soul classic, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bno_MRlHtM0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Love I Lost""</a>, Parrish drops us midway into the track. He makes Teddy Pendergrass' honeyed yet gritty vocals bump against the sparse organ and guitar opening of the song (with plenty of vinyl crackle at the edges) before dumping both atop the propulsive middle section. What makes its sloppy nine minutes work is how he swings the equalization to extremes on every component, finding new spaces and juxtapositions where there previously were none. What should be familiar and mere repetition is anything but. As he once told <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?896"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Resident Advisor</a>: ""Repetition kind of sets a certain mass in a song… then there's little bits that come in and out and these changes that kinda shift on that pivot. This is where I go in my head sometimes… shifting, spinning, all kinds of stuff."" Consider these 18 tracks, then, the results of Parrish's ever-spinning musical centrifuge.</p></div>"|15952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15952-uget/|8.0|Andy Beta

All those 1980s and 90s approximations of the future, in which we'd collectively have luxury stacked on top of luxury, actually sort of arrived, and they're totally awesome-- and really fucking creepy.</p>
<p><i>Far Side Virtual</i> is inspired by goofy junk like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUbjTapNImM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Windows 95 sound</a> (composed by Brian Eno, it should be mentioned) and the melodies that kick out of a medium-priced keyboard when you punch the ""demo"" button. It's a collection of eerily wholesome sounds delivered in an uncomfortably straightforward manner. Either a whole lot of work or very little work went into this record.</p>
<p>This is a ""sell-out"" album. Not in the pejorative sense of pandering-- it's actually a much more difficult listen than his previous work-- but because it's intended to score mindless comfort and endless hours of outlet shopping. And unlike his other releases, which toyed with similar concepts of getting lost in the technological, consumerist singularity of energy drinks, action flicks, and worldwide web convenience, this one doesn't send the soundtrack through the gossamer hum of a VHS. There's no distance between the concept and the execution here. Every sound on, say, ""Fro Yo and Cellular Bits""-- a triple threat of rocking drums, melting synths, and a guitar solo that wants to be Eddie Van Halen but comes closer to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZKpByV5764"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stan Bush</a>-- is clear as a bell.</p>
<p>Indeed, the songs here are exactly the same as what they're ostensibly parodying, which is bold and maybe even the point. Such dedication to an aesthetic means <i>Far Side Virtual</i> gets a little tedious: It's 16 songs that aren't all that catchy but aren't exactly ambient either. Subsumed by his concept, Ferraro is one with the buying and selling machine, which was perhaps his perverse goal all along. ""Hopefully these songs were made available for ringtone,"" he declared in this <a href=""http://fashion.elle.com/culture/2011/10/25/james-ferraros-versace-dreams/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Elle</i> interview</a>, ""and the album will be condensed into ringtone format, so the album won't be the centerpiece, it will just dissipate into the infrastructure.""</p>
<p>There is however, an obsessive focus on authenticity that really works towards justifying the album's goofy indulgences. Quite a few tracks feature a robotic voice speaking to you (""Sir, Richard Branson's avatar says hello""), providing a bizarre, world-building aspect to the project. And, hey, this kind of music is pretty great! There is a place for pleasant, lilting tunes made to be ignored. The propulsive MIDI symphony of ""Dubai Dream Tone"" and the stiff jazz on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12536-adventures-in-green-foot-printing/"" target=""_blank"">""Adventures in Green Foot Printing""</a> are undeniable and surprisingly affecting-- like a cyborg Vince Guaraldi was placed in front of a keyboard and told to knock out some somber tunes.</p>
<p>The nightmarish qualities of the music begin to break through on ""Dream On"" and ""Condo Pets"", both of which possess some of the creepy, cacophonous drone of <i>Citrac</i> or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15643-nightdolls-with-hairspray-on-air/"">Night Dolls With Hairspray</a></i>, subtly unveiling the horrors behind music that's just way too springy and wide-eyed. You suddenly realize you're listening to 45 minutes of utilitarian music that doesn't really have a purpose. Can something be utopian and dystopian at the same time? Probably. Maybe even always.</p></div>"|15992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15992-james-ferraro-far-side-virtual/|7.6|Brandon Soderberg

With her versatile project <a href=""http://www.evangelistasounds.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Evangelista</a>, she seems at last to have found its ideal vehicle. <i>In Animal Tongue</i> is the latest album under the Evangelista name, and hearing it can feel like watching a veteran character actress with an expertise for perfecting new accents finally sink her teeth into a meaty, recurring role. Though <i>In Animal Tongue</i> stills draws on many of the same elements that have informed her previous work (blues, industrial noise, spoken word) they have here been distilled ever further down to a murky, brooding essence.</p>
<p>Never an especially conventional band to begin with, Evangelista have been gradually edging away from standard rock textures. Whereas previous albums <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11360-hello-voyager/"" target=""_blank"">Hello, Voyager</a></i> and <i>Prince of Truth</i> contained sudden moments of loud metallic catharsis, <i>In Animal Tongue</i> is almost entirely percussion-less and frequently arrhythmic. Bozulich is joined once again by bassist Tara Barnes and arranger/multi-instrumentalist Dominic Cramp, who provide a necessary degree of continuity, but there is something essentially solitary and lonesome about Evangelista's music.<span> </span>With her lyrics filled with references to blood, natural danger, and combat, Bozulich gives <i>In Animal Tongue</i> the impression of a wild animal crouched ominously in a darkened corner, waiting patiently for the opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>From a sonic standpoint, Evangelista's most natural ancestor is the noisier work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Waits</a> circa <i>Bone Machine</i> or <i>The Black Rider. </i>Unlike Waits, however, Bozulich makes no use of either grand, weepy melodies or any vestige of wry humor. Indeed the semi-spoken whispers and mutters of such tracks as ""Black Jesus"" or ""Die Alone"" can seem to lack any sense of movement, with Bozulich’s bleak and emotive vocals (""My body has failed me on this cold night, and I'll die by myself in the dark"") destined to circle endlessly through the shadowy wilderness.</p>
<p>After a point this lightless gloom can get a tad oppressive, but Evangelista are able to leaven the mood somewhat through consistently inventive instrumentation. The album's most percussive track, ""Hands of Leather"", is driven by guitar and handclaps, and though its lyrics might easily be about a boxing match, the impact is that of accidentally stumbling onto an ancient forest ritual. On ""Tunnel to the Stars"", the rhythms drop away to be replaced by a churning string quartet, composed by Dominic Cramp, with Bozulich's distorted vocals riding queasily over the din.</p>
<p>Most arresting of all might be the closing piece, ""Hatching"".

She sounded massive, but shrill. Overpowering. If the show took place in an <i>X-Men</i> movie, the wind gushing from Welch's lungs would have propelled several patrons smashing through the Bowery's back window onto Delancey Street. The next time I encountered That Voice, it was five months later, in the relatively gigantic Terminal 5 on Manhattan's far west side. And while that venue is often knocked for its booming, detail-abolishing acoustics, and concrete-slab atmosphere, it was a much better fit for Welch, who hopped, ran, and wailed while 3,000 giddy fans looked on, awestruck. For this band and this singer, nothing could be too big. Or so it seemed.</p>
<p>Growing up, Welch was met with stern eyes when she was caught singing her favorite hymns with a bit too much verve. Her unbridled talent is the type of thing producers of TV singing contests fantasize about. It's soulful. It's instant. It's blaring. On ""American Idol"", contestants like Welch are invariably deemed ""quirky"" and doomed to runner-up status. And though Welch is a more convincing Artist than even the best ""Idol"" has to offer, make no mistake that her voice-first delivery is perfectly tailored for a generation who grew up judging singers as much as they listened to them. Even the hopelessly hip crowd that showed up to see Welch at Vice's Creators Project event last month saved one of their biggest ovations for the moment when she held out one piercing note for an exaggerated period of time-- a primal sign of skill that banks on nothing less than sheer audacity.</p>
<p>The same can be said of Florence and the Machine's second album, <i>Ceremonials</i>, which can feel like Welch simply holding out a single note at top volume for an hour. On paper, the album takes a wise path. After trying out a few different producers and styles-- garage-pop; vampy twinkle-pop; and tribal, mystic-pop-- on her debut, <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13372-lungs/"" target=""_blank"">Lungs</a></i>, Welch settles almost exclusively on the latter for <i>Ceremonials</i>, bringing along producer Paul Epworth, who was so good at the mystic stuff on the first record, to oversee the whole thing. So what we get is Florence trying very hard to top the gargantuan drums and cascading harps and chest-thumping choruses of <i>Lungs</i> hits like <a href=""http://youtu.be/2EIeUlvHAiM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cosmic Love""</a> and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11278-rabbit-heart-raise-it-up/"" target=""_blank"">""Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)""</a> on damn near every song. Instead of <i>Lungs</i>' largely charming yet discombobulating diversity, <i>Ceremonials</i> suffers from a repetitiveness that's akin to looking at a skyline filled with 100-story behemoths lined-up one after the other, blocking out everything but their own size.</p>
<p>Some of these world wonders stand tall despite their surroundings. First single <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12525-shake-it-out/"" target=""_blank"">""Shake It Out""</a>, a stadium-willing anthem about getting past one's troubles, sets a new high for this group. As does the similarly barreling ""No Light, No Light"", which is one of the few tracks where Welch sets aside her usual flighty, dreamy, goth-y lyrical go-to's-- ghosts, graveyards, devils, angels, myths, drowning-- for something a bit more personal. ""Would you leave me, if I told you what I'd become,"" she sings during the track's magisterial bridge, ""'Cause it's so easy to sing it to a crowd/ But it's so hard, my love/ To say it to you out loud."" The lines double as a snippet of self-criticism; perhaps Welch finds it ""so easy"" to sing her tunes to thousands because they often lack an individual touch that could send them even further skyward-- the same touch that comes so naturally to fellow UK chart queen <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/"" target=""_blank"">Adele</a>. But by the midway point of the LP, its endless crescendos start bleeding into each other, and the loudness soon tires itself out.</p>
<p>The few tracks that deviate from the heavens-broken-open formula hardly curb frustrations. The haughty ""Breaking Down"" could be an outtake from <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"" target=""_blank"">MGMT</a>'s career-stalling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14122-congratulations/"" target=""_blank""><i>Congratulations</i></a><i>, </i>dirge-y ""Seven Devils"" aims for Beelzebub but is about as haunting as a toddler with a pitchfork. In what's becoming an increasingly annoying problem in this era of iTunes bonus tracks and myriad deluxe editions, it's the extras not included on the proper album that offer reasonable outs for Florence's Big issues. ""Remain Nameless"" replaces the record's corporate-rock drums and overzealous whoosh with an electronic minimalism similar to Welch's pals <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"" target=""_blank"">the xx</a>. The song's allowed to breathe, and is all the better for it. Other bonuses include a few demos of some of the record's huger cuts (and the term ""demo"" is relative here-- these stripped-back tracks are still pristine). Backed by only acoustic instrumentation, we finally hear the creases in Welch's voice that the album whitewashes at every turn.</p>
<p>""I don't want your future, don't need your past/ One bright moment, is all I ask,"" sings Welch on choir-aided closer ""Leave My Body"". <i>Ceremonials </i>is so hell-bent on providing such ""bright moments""-- that flash of overwhelming emotion resulting from ramped-up strings or a frantic harp or a particularly audacious vocal run-- that it never zooms out to consider its own listenability. Welch is 25, and she's likely chuffed at the thought of bringing these massive songs to equally immense crowds at festivals all over the world for the next two years. And that's where many of these tracks will have the greatest chance to thrive-- in the open, with heads as far as one can see. On record, though, too much is crushed by blind ambition.</p></div>"|16004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16004-ceremonials/|6.0|Ryan Dombal

There's a certain comfort in that kind of reciprocity, and anyone who's ever accidentally reset the listening history on their iTunes library and felt like they'd wiped a part of their identity clean is familiar with the digital world's maddening indifference to our affection. With that observation, Reynolds hits on the unifying and fundamentally human allure of chillwave, lo-fi, smear-pop, and any other kind of contemporary music that makes a conscious choice in an Auto-Tuned world to sound less than pristine. It's music trying to approximate the grubby, hopelessly destructive way we love books, records, and each other.</span></p>
<p>Like a pre-owned Delorean or a <i>Berlin</i> cassette slowly decaying in the bargain bin, Portland trio <a href=""http://bbblouse.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blouse</a>'s self-titled debut comes to us sounding like it's already been colored by somebody else's use. Though it's got an unabashedly Reagan-era sound, it's the record's almost pathological obsession with the past that places it so squarely in the now. Any of its 10 tracks could sit comfortably on pretty much anyone's 2010s playlist: it broods like a lower-fi version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29761-charli-xcx/"" target=""_blank"">Charli XCX</a>'s Cold War-tinged tunes, it beams through cloudy dark like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5687-john-maus/"" target=""_blank"">John Maus</a>' murky pop, and it even boasts a song called ""Videotapes"" on which the synths <i>sound</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> </span><i>like warping videotapes</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">.<br/></span></p>
<p>And yet, <i>Blouse</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> amounts to something more evocative and suggestive than trendy pastiche. There's one obvious reason: Some of these songs are just really that good. ""Into Black"" strikes the right balance of lush atmosphere and driving force, while the mid-tempo ""Controller"" evokes an austere cool. It's album opener ""Firestarter"", though, that best expresses the young band's manifesto, introducing them as a dream-pop group intent on razing the roof. ""Let's forget the ceiling,"" vocalist Charlie Hilton beckons beguilingly over a wash of twinkling synths, ""It's just made of stone.""</span></p>
<p>Hilton's voice is breathy and commanding though not terribly distinct-- think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">Victoria Legrand</a> channeling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"" target=""_blank"">Trish Keenan</a> minus a bit of <i>je ne sais quoi</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. The propellant at the heart of Blouse is bassist Jacob Portrait, who also plays with Portland psych-poppers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28890-unknown-mortal-orchestra/"" target=""_blank"">Unknown Mortal Orchestra</a>: His steady pulse gives the songs just enough oomph to keep them from getting lost in their own gloom. Unlike many of their contemporaries, Blouse aren't out to deconstruct 1980s pop so much as dutifully replicate its essence. It's an easy thing to do wrong, but Blouse find success by not overreaching their grasp. It's beside the point to fault a record like this for not being innovative; by the end of this stretch of songs, there's something almost noble about their poker-faced commitment to time travel.</span></p>
<p>There are a few moments when all the backward glancing becomes a bit heavy-handed, but in their most inspired moments, Blouse find the connection between the limits of outdated technology and the terrible bliss of desiring something impermanent. (In one song Hilton's idea of fun is watching a lone blackbird perched on a telephone wire, ""Just long enough to notice when he flies away/ Because he always flies away."") Blouse <span style=""font-style: normal;"">aren't just nostalgic for the golden years of MTV pop, but for an entire way of interacting with the world-- for the romance of a time when some things still felt out of reach. ""Videotapes"" finds Hilton longing to see the face of her perennially camera-shy lover. ""What it would be like to see you again,"" she croons, wishing she had a videotape to remind her. That this sentiment feels like such an anachronism in a culture satiated by instant gratification only makes the track more heartbreaking. </span><i>Blouse</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> harkens back to love in the time before GPS to mine an enduring truth of pop music: getting lost has always sounded good.</span></p></div>"|15993.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15993-blouse-st/|7.4|Lindsay Zoladz

Whether innovation, futurism, rebellion, or austerity, such creative constraints help rein in the limitless possibilities of synthesizers and samplers. <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/therealalterego"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Roman Flügel</a> is not exempt from this. A veteran of leftfield electronic production, Flügel has released professional DJ mixes and collaborated on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2639-superstructure/"" target=""_blank"">jazz/techno hybrid</a>; he works under different aliases (Soylent Green, with collaborator Jörn Wuttke in Acid Jesus and Holy Garage) for varying styles. (Several years ago he made waves with his ""Dirty Dutch"" anthem, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVJSTTvJ23I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Geht's Noch?""</a>.) Many of his releases are 12"" singles, utilitarian in purpose if not sound. So naturally one of the greatest aspects of Flügel's debut LP under his given name, <i>Fatty Folders</i>, is how untethered and adrift it is. This is not to say that <i>Folders</i> is experimental, just that it's difficult to place. As best I can tell, Flügel has no overriding purpose other than to produce gummy techno, the kind that sticks to the roof of your mouth (and the kind you happily leave up there).</p>
<p>Flügel has seen a decade-plus of singles, collaborations, and live sets receive near-unanimous praise. His 12""s, while diverse, have tended toward the mechanistic and throbbing, though he's always been slightly out of step with his contemporaries in the German scene, eschewing the severe austerity of Ostgut Ton and the lush minimalism of Traum. (Dial, a Hamburg-based label whose releases often seem rote and plain before revealing intricacies, is as good a home as any for Flügel.) <i>Folders</i> collects a handful of tracks from recent EPs and singles but offers mostly new material and, as such, stands as the most accessible and robust barometer of his work to date.</p>
<p><i>Folders</i> doesn't offer any kind of narrative-- not of Flügel's career, not of a broader music scene, not even intra-album. On display instead is the sheer variety of sounds Flügel conjures, and how vibrant they seem in his arrangements. If Flügel has a trick-- though he is not really the type of producer who relies on them-- it's saving his tiniest, most erudite melodies for his bangers and getting big-eyed and starry during his softer moments. ""The Improviser"" falls into the former category, its rude, burping bass barely ceding any ground to the dubby vibraphone sounds that sneak in. On the other end of the spectrum, the panning, glowing sunrays of ""Krautus"" would be at home on any <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"" target=""_blank"">Field</a> record, and ""Don't Break My Heart"" sounds like a pleasant Saturday morning in a clock repair shop.</p>
<p>If there's one true monster track on <i>Folders</i>, it's the previously released <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJxTod0nx60"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How to Spread Lies""</a>, a patient, autumnal mid-tempo caress that relies equally on a descending piano melody and a subtle, four-note bassline. That it's been out for over a year won't matter to anyone but the most vigilant Flügel fans. (Considering both ""Lies"" and ""Geht's Noch?"", it would be somewhat ironic if the versatile, understated Flügel were remembered mostly for a few standout tracks.) <i>Fatty Folders</i> is a summation of Flügel's career not in sound but in scope: It's multifaceted, rich, and cagey. He's worth the investment for casual techno fans, even if you only have time for the CliffsNotes.</p></div>"|15983.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15983-fatty-folders/|8.0|Andrew Gaerig

It's also the cheeky title of Dominick Fernow's new <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"" target=""_blank"">Prurient</a> EP, which itself rumbles inexorably and sometimes unbearably forward until it reaches a Big Crunch that sounds as apocalyptic as the one promised by some physicists. The five tracks here seem to be slowly shedding the trappings of music itself, all the dark-pop armature Fernow has grafted onto Prurient's old shriek-the-pain-away sound over the last few years, until all that remains is fearsome and formless noise.</p>
<p>On <i>Time's Arrow</i>, the comforts of familiar rhythm and melody are stripped back, track by track, to reveal the snarling, primal sound mass from which they were beaten into shape. With a jittery programmed beat that recalls <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/6076-big-black/"" target=""_blank"">Big Black</a> at their most despondent and yet more sour synth squiggles that prove John Carpenter is the biggest influence on the darker end of electronic music in the 21st-century, the title track takes off from the creepy-but-clearly-defined hooks of Prurient's brilliant <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15651-bermuda-drain/"" target=""_blank"">Bermuda Drain</a></i> album from earlier in 2011. It's a possible contender for jam-of-the-year for all the ex-goths, one-time industrial obsessives, and collectors of soundtracks from obscure 1980s horror movies. But the rest of the EP sounds like it was made by a lunatic from one of those obscure 80s horror movies, as if that deranged slasher had somehow escaped into real world and been asked to record a few tunes for a cassette label. And you can imagine the sort of emotions such a jolly fellow would want to express through sound.</p>
<p>So the beat becomes a nearly arrhythmic clattering on ""Let's Make a Slave"". They keyboard melodies become cover-your-ears squeals of distortion, as if someone were jabbing a knife into an amplifier. Following the brooding but almost catchy <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12714-times-arrow/"" target=""_blank"">""Time's Arrow""</a>, Fernow's most conventional <i>song</i> yet, order itself seems to be breaking down across the rest of the EP, a vibe brought home by the blasted, end-of-the-world atmosphere and Fernow's increasingly desperate last-man-on-Earth vocal perfomances. By ""Maskless Face"", his eerie monotone monologues have given away to frustrated howlings that express nothing but rage, and even that connection to human pain is severed by the EP's end. ""Slavery in the Bahamas"" plays like a rapid-fire tape collage of the ugliest sounds the post-industrial world has to offer-- the spluttering of downed power lines, the disembodied groans of information sluicing through a modem, buildings and machinery being crushed to nothing-- as if the whole show was coming to a swift and brutal end.</p>
<p>But <i>Time's Arrow</i> ends not in a deafening silence after the final track’s implosion. It's perhaps no accident that ""Slavery in the Bahamas"" ends with the faint sound of a lovely tune sneaking its way out of the squall. If you play the EP on a loop, this snatch of pleasant human music-making seems to lead quite naturally back into the title cut. Of course if you then play the EP straight through again, everything comes crashing down once more. With a kind of grim pleasure, <i>Time's Arrow</i> suggests that all that effort, writing songs and constructing coherent albums, will always eventually give way to the chaos that rumbles dangerously under any attempt to impose control over noise, if you just let go.</p></div>"|16006.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16006-times-arrow/|7.0|Jess Harvell

The first quick, rhythm-dominated moments of opener ""WUJ"" propel <i>Neverendless</i> forward. The Chicago psych collective has likely been studying up on krautrock for a long time, and it dives headlong into that territory with a motorik drive, bass grooves, and Neu!-reminiscent synths. It's a lead track that knows how to build-- beginning with a sparse canvas, over the course of seven minutes it maintains a steady groove while adding and switching out layers. CAVE don't throw away that psych fuzz they do so well-- halfway in, the volume ramps up and the guitars become markedly heavier. That sturdy rhythm remains for the entire seven minutes, but they don't settle on one sound: They quiet down, increase the volume, add subtle licks, string airy synths above their guttural guitars, and all the while, establish a few central hooks.</p>
<p>The band's bread and butter is creating spacey psych jams; in that sense, <i>Neverendless </i>doesn't break new ground. What is new is the feeling of focus and structure in their music. While previous albums <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13071-psychic-psummer/"" target=""_blank"">Psychic Psummer</a></i> and the <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14250-pure-moods-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Pure Moods</a> </i>EP felt looser, more spontaneous, jammy, and sometimes more erratic or meandering, <i>Neverendless</i> sounds premeditated and perfectly executed. They've never been sloppy or careless, but never quite this tight. That structure likely comes from a semi-rigid percussion blueprint and a few well-defined melodies within each song. This is CAVE's first outing as a four-piece, and they find an easy synchronicity with each other-- when they make a change in the groove, everybody falls in line (except maybe the drummer, who maintains the largely unswerving drive). Even spastic guitar solos fall neatly into the confines of the beat.</p>
<p>It's also CAVE's most elegant record to date, mostly because of ""On the Rise"", six minutes of warm, slow ebullience. Soft synths mimic wind instruments and pepper a steady beat. They introduce a handful of melodic, joyous guitar hooks. In the only prominent vocal of the album, they chant, ""on the rise,"" repeatedly, in an almost ceremonial way. The song is a surprising move. On plenty of albums by jammy psych rockers, one go-to vibe is menace-- it's easy to make a largely instrumental song with prominent bass sound big and intimidating. It's much harder to create something that sounds warm or inviting. They achieve that here without compromising their established feel-- a reverb-drenched, rapid-firing guitar leads the chanting vocals into another calm groove.<i> Neverendless</i> also suggests that they do much better when given time to spread out. The four-minute ""Adam Roberts"" is the shortest and worst track of the bunch. The bassline is oppressively big and repetitive, followed by an organ that evokes obnoxious circus music. There's no build, no contrasting elements, and, in the end, nothing to look forward to-- just four minutes of the same semi-obnoxious riff in the middle of the album.</p>
<p>Regardless, the record keeps moving. Sometimes it moves with warmth, and sometimes with motorik rhythm. On the 14-minute ""This Is the Best"" it pushes forward with a droning synth that lies underneath the rest of the song's layers. Seven minutes in, crunching guitars and buoying bass runs bury that synth. There are swirling, moaning vocals for a moment, and the guitar goes from a quick riff to an evenly spaced trudge. And through those gradual changes in the song's structure, the percussion holds sway. The drums make one change that stretches out for the song's final minutes, going to a hurried snare. It meets up with some equally hurried synths, which lay out a cluttered feeling of anxiety. And it doesn't stop for a few minutes. With hit after hit of urgent-sounding synths and drums, CAVE never let up or get faster, either. That's what they do best on <i> Neverendless</i>-- they just keep going.</p></div>"|15921.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15921-cave-neverendless/|7.9|Evan Minsker

The record that convinces most is <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9371-pet-sounds-40th-anniversary/"" target=""_blank"">Pet Sounds</a></i>, that understated 1966 masterpiece that articulates a specific kind of teenage longing and loneliness like nothing before or since. Once you've absorbed that record, you find yourself going back through songs like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y-0nWVdBH4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Worry Baby""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70psCljGnXM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Warmth of the Sun""</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WP2exZurfc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Get Around""</a>, finding a deeper brilliance where you once heard only pop craftsmanship. As you make these discoveries, you come to learn about the auteur at the center of it all, Brian Wilson, who shouldered the burden of being the creative force in one of the most successful and musically ambitious pop bands of the era. And then you find out about <i>SMiLE</i>.</p>
<p>Conceived, recorded, and ultimately abandoned in 1966 and 1967, <i>SMiLE</i> was to be something like Brian's <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i>, his attempt to make the great art-pop album of the era. He followed his muse to the ends of the earth, putting a grand piano in a massive living room sandbox, outfitting another room with an Arabian tent, making session musicians wear fireman's hats for the recording of a song about the elements, freaking out when an actual fire broke out down the street from the studio around the time of recording of said track, and, no surprise, taking enough drugs to amplify the whole scene and turn it into something terrifying. But the record was not to be. The music recorded for <i>SMiLE</i> was too far-out for the rest of the band (lead singer Mike Love hated the lyrics penned by Wilson's collaborator, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8485-van-dyke-parks/"" target=""_blank"">Van Dyke Parks</a>, an opinion he still holds) and Wilson had trouble finishing tracks. Eventually, he shelved the record for good and the band issued the low-key, weird, and supremely stoned <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11667-smiley-smilewild-honey/"" target=""_blank"">Smiley Smile</a></i>. By setting the record aside, Wilson became afraid to indulge his talent, and his contributions to the Beach Boys would never again be central to the band.</p>
<p>If you're wired a certain way, once you learn the <i>SMiLE</i> story, you long to hear the album that never was. It looms out there in imagination, an album that lends itself to storytelling and legend, like the aural equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster. And the songs from the sessions that eventually made it out on other records-- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2_wBbS7I08"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Surf's Up""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbAWMc-E5P4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cabin Essence""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lkk8Cku4p8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heroes and Villains""</a>, and more, including material on the 1993 Beach Boys career-overview box <i>Good Vibrations</i>-- were so brilliant that the lack of proper release becomes almost painful. So you might start hunting down bootlegs, poring over the fragments, and finding competing edits and track sequences, which only feeds your desire to know what the ""real"" <i>SMiLE</i> could have been.</p>
<p>Only in 2003, when long-time Beach Boys fanatic and tape trader Darian Sahanaja and his band the Wondermints collaborated with Brian on a live version of <i>SMiLE</i> and 2004's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8781-smile/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE</a></i> album did the lost record assume a definitive shape. But as exciting as that record was at the time, the lure of the originals never went away. So there was naturally a great deal of excitement when, early this year, we heard that the original tapes were being assembled for official release. This epic story finally has an ending, and it's a very happy one. As archival projects go, <i>SMiLE</i> is as surprising, generous, and successful as anything in recent memory. The version of the album, based on the Wilson/Wondermints sequence, feels remarkably complete and whole, even though it was largely built from unfinished scraps.</p>
<p>During this period, Wilson and Parks were working on an enormous canvas. They were using words and music to tell a story of America. If the early-60s Beach Boys were about California, that place where the continent ends and dreams are born, <i>SMiLE</i> is about how those dreams were first conceived. Moving west from Plymouth Rock, we view cornfields and farmland and the Chicago fire and jagged mountains, the Grand Cooley Damn, the California coast-- and we don't stop until we hit Hawaii. Cowboy songs, cartoon Native American chants, barroom rags, jazzy interludes, rock'n'roll, sweeping classical touches, street-corner doo-wop, and town square barbershop quartet are swirled together into an ever-shifting technicolor dream.</p>
<p>Befitting an album concerned with history, <i>SMiLE</i> feels strangely adrift from time, using the technology of the day and an avant-garde approach to pop song form to make the past look both familiar and strange. In 1966 and 1967, old-timey music, if you squinted at it just so, could be imbued with a haze of psychedelia. And this is a deeply psychedelic album, though disorientation mostly comes from its juxtapositions, how the orchestral miniatures (or ""feels,"" as Wilson called his modular melodic ideas) bump into each other and find their way from one song to the next, the ""Heroes and Villains"" refrain here, the ""Child Is Father of the Man"" refrain there.</p>
<p>The 2004 sequence divided the album into three ""movements,"" with songs connected thematically, and this reissue wisely puts each on its own side of vinyl (if you want only the record proper, the 2xLP, with key outtakes added on the fourth side, is absolutely the way to go). Each movement has at least one pop masterpiece. On the first, there's ""Heroes and Villains"" and ""Cabin Essence"", both exploring western themes in Parks' bent style. Here and especially on side two's ""Surf's Up"", the level of Parks' writing is astounding. He had the sound-driven jumble of imagery of contemporaneous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Dylan</a>, but his words were far tighter and more disciplined. He also understood the power of a good pun. Sounds are slurred together to take on new meaning through clusters that extended beyond the spaces between the words. So, ""The music hall, a costly bow,"" in ""Surf's Up"" also sounds like, ""The music holocaust,"" and lines like, ""canvas the town and brush the backdrop,"" layer image atop image with breathtaking efficiency.</p>
<p>Each side's arc also serves to push forward the record as a whole. <i>Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE</i> has made this sequencing seem canonical, and there were enough raw materials in the vault available to piece together a worthy approximation. Once in a while, you can hear a stitch or shift that would have no doubt been done over later, but those moments are rare and ultimately only add to the record's charm. By the time the tense and throbbing neo-classical piece ""Fire (Mrs. O'Leary's Cow)"" comes along in the third movement and then leads into ""Love to Say Dada"" (mostly an instrumental, it was meant to have lyrics; they were added for <i>Brian Wilson Presents Smile</i>, the song titled ""In Blue Hawaii"") and then to the extended ""Good Vibrations"", the strength of the album as a full piece is staggering.</p>
<p>But part of the allure of <i>SMiLE</i> will always be the pieces, and the deluxe box has a lot of them. There's almost a full disc of ""Heroes and Villains"" fragments and another entire CD with bits of ""Good Vibrations"". Given the nature of this release, the extras are illuminating, arguably more essential than most outtakes included with bonus albums. Having source materials hints at roads not taken, and also offers insight into the difficulty of actually creating a record on this scale, given how much we've heard about all the bouncing and layering that <i>SMiLE</i> entailed (the complexity of which is partly to blame for the project's being late and ultimately abandoned) and how many of the basic tracks were recorded live in the studio with a dozen or more musicians at once. There were only four and eight tracks to work with on the tape of the time, so one of them would need multiple instruments just to have voices and overdubs added later. Not to mention that these modular sections were eventually going to be stitched together with tape and razorblades. Beyond the fragments, there are brilliant single performances, like the two demo versions of ""Surf's Up"". To my ears, the song is a high-water mark of pop songwriting, positively haunting with its melodic twists and turns. And Brian's vocal performances, with wild leaps into the upper reaches of his falsetto, give the track an almost unbearable poignancy. It's incredible to think that ""Surf's Up"" would remain in the vault for five years, until it appeared in re-worked form on the 1971 album of the same name.</p>
<p>On the sessions material, you also get to hear Wilson running the show in the studio, and apart from a few asides where he talks about hash and LSD, he sounds excited, patient, and kind, offering encouragement about mood, timing, and tempo. He surely wasn't an easy guy to work for, but hearing his voice on these tapes, it's remarkable how together he seems and how willing he is to work with these musicians to make something great. Most of all, his studio patter provides a nice counterbalance to <i>SMiLE</i>'s prevailing narrative, of a crazed genius unraveling in the face of trying to create his masterpiece. We love crack-up stories. There's something in the Western psyche that loves to romanticize the alleged connection between madness and genius. And someone like Wilson-- fragile, paranoid, childlike, and dreamy-- fits one template of the crazed genius to a T. Never mind that he was a student of music, put in twice as many hours of extremely hard work as anyone else in the band, and relied greatly on collaboration and outside inspiration. When thinking of <i>SMiLE</i>, the guy in the fireman's hat thinking his music could burn down buildings is who we remember. But now we have the full picture. <i>SMiLE</i> was never finished, and it still isn't, but we can safely say this is as close as it'll ever come. What's here is brilliant, beautiful, and, most importantly, finally able to stand tall on its own.</p></div>"|16000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16000-the-smile-sessions/|10.0|Mark Richardson

With all that room, there's plenty of scope to rebuild things, rearrange the elements, and see how the angles of all those deep echoes change. Dabrye's 2008 chrome-and-neon g-funk remix of ""One Ting"" was one of the earliest reinterpretations of Kevin Martin and Roger Robinson's collaborative efforts, and possibly the best to date. But it also shared space on the ""Cool Out"" b-side with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a>' twitchy, boiling-water mutation of ""Lost""-- a remix just as eager to coax out the ghostly elements of Robinson's voice, but approaching it more like a counterpoint than a complement.</p>
<p>Both cuts appear on <i>Without You</i>, a remix album that largely pulls off the rare feat of adding to its source material's mystique without necessarily displacing it. It's not really a track-by-track revisit, and there's a deep focus on some songs in particular-- like the Kiki Hitomi feature ""Goodbye Girl"", which gets three different reinterpretations from three different remixers. (And that's on the digital/CD version; the 2xLP has five.) But while the versions spring from the same source material, and they all preserve the source track's heartbroken bitterness, it's all to different ends. Take note of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27919-jamie-vexd/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie Vex'd</a>'s rework under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29925-kuedo/"" target=""_blank"">Kuedo</a> alias, which pares back and pitches up Robinson's voice to put more attention on Hitomi's sharp-edged purr, and ramps up the drums while turning the backing track into a borderline-gothic drone. Put it next to the Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe rework, and that only makes the latter track's ambient bent sound that much more austere and suspenseful, like the noise of an abandoned space station. And there's still room for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23212-echospace/"" target=""_blank"">Echospace</a>'s<span> </span>all-analog reassemblage, which streamlines near-subliminal rumbles of the vocal track into an ultra-dense, bass-heavy yet still billowy minimal house groove.</p>
<p>It's easy to lose track of things with this multiple-version lineup. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"" target=""_blank"">Gang Gang Dance</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22892-mala/"" target=""_blank"">Mala</a> take turns shifting the foreboding environmental-crisis warnings of ""Earth a Kill Ya"" into opposite avenues, the former constructing a hiccupy bionic junkshop skank rhythm around it while the latter drops propulsive, bongo-driven vintage dubstep breaks into the original track's once-austere surroundings. And the other take on ""Lost"" besides FlyLo's belongs to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27668-nite-jewel/"" target=""_blank"">Nite Jewel</a>, and her sun-bleached electro-pop is enriched enough by Robinson's voice to defy any chillwitch dreamhouse associations you could throw at it. And yet all these reworks and revisions stay in the general vicinity of the original album's tone of massive yet starkly open spaces, adding a few new facets but always staying close to the fine line <i>Waiting for You </i>treaded between bleak and euphoric.</p>
<p>The other trick is to scatter in some revoices along with the remixes, with different singers and vocal tracks versioning dubs of the original Martin productions. ""Spin Me Around"" is the most revelatory, as Cooly G uses the 100-story-high swoon of ""Meltdown"" to lay down what is more or less a straight-up R&amp;B vocal-- and a knockout at that, love-stoned and out of her own mind with ecstasy. And D-bridge's title-track revoice of ""Without You"" matches Robinson's rich yet vulnerable precedent with a resonantly fragile deep house-indebted vocal lead of his own. Others feel a bit more dispensable: there's some attention-getting restrained intensity in Hitomi's voice in her takeover of ""Cool Out"" on ""Tears"", but it's more of a pleasant variation on the original's lover's-rock bliss than a bonafide transformation. And revoices featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"" target=""_blank"">Ford &amp; Lopatin</a>'s Joel Ford (""Say Something"") and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4116-scritti-politti/"" target=""_blank"">Scritti Politti</a>'s Green Gartside (""Come and Behold"") sound a bit too bright and upbeat, getting a bit <span> </span>at-odds with the original deep-dub atmosphere to click as strongly as the others. No matter-- there's still plenty of room for them.</p></div>"|15975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15975-king-midas-sound-without-you/|7.7|Nate Patrin

Obviously, there are reasons this has caught on as the party line, but I want to be careful about picking apart the reasons the comparison is accurate, as well as the ways it's not. Direct comparisons between their music aren't much use. Hendrix was coming from a background in blues and R&amp;B; Koray was a co-founder of Turkey's first (as far as we know) rock band in 1957, but from his home in Istanbul he didn't have to look too far to the east to find a host of interesting sounds to combine with rock'n'roll. I think the comparison, more than anything, ultimately has more to do with Koray's impact on the use of the electric guitar in Turkish popular music than it does with any similarity in their music.</p>
<p>And in that sense, the comparison holds some water. Koray's use of the guitar had a profound effect on the way the instrument's role was perceived by his fellow musicians. His use of effects and his deft playing were pioneering, and he was one of the first handful of musicians to actively push for the integration of Turkish folk sounds with rock and psychedelia, even going so far as to electrify the <span>bağlama</span>, a traditional Turkish stringed instrument. From 1965 to 1968, the national Turkish newspaper <span><i>Hürriyet</i> organized annual contests called Altin Mikrofon (Golden Microphone) with a set of simple rules that did much to create a distinctively Turkish style of rock: Contest entrants had to either compose new songs in Turkish or cover a traditional song, but the arrangements had to be in a rock style, played on Western electric instruments.</span></p>
<p>It's a strange, top-down way of creating a scene, but it worked, and Koray was among the many musicians whose music evolved through entering the contest. Sublime Frequencies' <i>Me</i><i>çhul: Singles &amp; Rarities</i> compilation picks up a couple of years after his last Altin Mikrofon entry, after he'd really honed his style and come into his own as a composer and arranger. The title is a giveaway that there's little in the way of an organizing principle behind the set-- the compilers essentially chose a smattering of Koray songs from the 1970s that they really liked, with no eye toward telling a coherent story about his career. That said, they did pick very well, and nearly every track is a killer.</p>
<p>For a good glimpse of Koray's singular ethno-rock style, it's hard to beat 1970's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_BjGHxqIW4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gün Doğmuyor""</a> (""No More Daybreak""). Koray's guitar part, accented by audibly snapping spring reverb is prettily melodic, but his softly sung vocal melody has hints of modal Turkish folk-- Koray clearly was feeling the influence of early progressive rock, too, and you can hear it in the dramatic double stops at the beginning of the refrain. The ethnic element grew stronger with time. On 1977's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl6jUX48SMk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Olmayınca Olmuyor""</a>, Koray's electrified <span>bağlama has supplanted the guitar, and the music has a thrilling progressive folk thrust to it that still sounds strangely modern.</span></p>
<p>Some of it is a little more directly relatable to American and British rock. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-szpE6TWGTQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Krallar""</a> sounds a little like the Amboy Dukes' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN2VNFpiGWo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Journey to the Center of the Mind""</a>, for example, but for each of those, there are two <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoIbXDxiYEM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Goca Dünya""</a>'s, where Koray plays his guitar in a style directly influenced by traditional saz and <span>bağlama players. In part thanks to the lasting effects of the Altin Mikrofon contest, exploring Turkish rock constantly reveals startling juxtapositions and unique sounds, and Koray's music is rich with such moments. If you're looking for an entry point into the world of Anatolian rock, he's an excellent place to start, and this compilation, so well-stocked with great songs and good playing, is good introduction, even if it doesn't approach his career systematically.</span></p></div>"|15994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15994-mechul-singles-rarities/|8.1|Joe Tangari

Count <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thelocrian"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Locrian</a> as part of that select circle. Something about the Chicago trio's sound is inherently ominous-- it's hard to imagine them playing ""Chopsticks"" without turning it into an earth-threatening thunderstorm. That effect is obvious in their noisier, more chaotic moments, where metallic noise and intense howls coalesce into scary crescendos. But it's just as strong in their quieter, more ambient stretches, when they build tension not from heightened climax but from sustained nuance.</p>
<p><i>The Clearing</i> could be Locrian's most nuanced record so far. Throughout, they use slow, far-off sounds rather in-your-face noise to thicken the atmosphere. A frozen piano line, distant drum roll, or shadowy bass loop is often all the group needs to forge a palpable mood. More than half of the side-long, album-closing title track is made of such minimal material. Yet somehow the band mines it for 17 minutes of sonic pressure. When the song eventually swells into a gnarled thatch of static and low end, Locrian sound less like a group gaining momentum than a mountain rising up through the ocean after years of rumbling below the surface.</p>
<p>There are more covert moments of tension on <i>The Clearing</i>, and they're pretty powerful, too. Most pulverizing is ""Augury in an Evaporating Tower"", whose mix of tones showcases the band's agility. At points, the cascading drums and elongated screams conjure <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"" target=""_blank"">Prurient</a> screamer Dominick Fernow's black metal band Ash Pool. But the band deftly shifts to oscillating drone and sky-seeking guitar that sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"" target=""_blank"">Earth</a>'s Dylan Carlson battling a synth monster. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12523-chalk-point/"" target=""_blank"">""Chalk Point""</a>, on the other hand, takes a more traditional path to its climax, building piano chords into a kind of post-rock metal dirge.</p>
<p>Still, what impresses most about <i>The Clearing</i> is not specific turns or isolated moments, but the overwhelming mood it creates. That's what makes the album title apt-- Locrian's dark atmospheres aren't empty spaces, but stark traces of something that was there not long before. In other words, they're as good at creating negative spaces as they are at filling them in. Even when they get so subdued that they approach silence, you can hear ghosts echoing in their void.</p></div>"|15997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15997-the-clearing/|7.4|Marc Masters

Of course a couple of dudes from Surfer Blood have an abrasive, noise-rock side project: while <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13844-astro-coast/"" target=""_blank"">Astro Coast</a></i> derived much of its strength from mastering a very narrow set of alt/indie touchstones-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"" target=""_blank"">Weezer</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Built+to+Spill"" target=""_blank"">Built to Spill</a>, all ca. 1994-- you had to figure such intense focus was a conscious choice to hide their freak flags rather than hard evidence that they didn't have any to begin with. The funny thing about <a href=""http://www.weirdwives.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Weird Wives</a>-- which includes SB guitarist Thomas Fekete, bassist Brian Black, and former tour percussionist Marcos Marchesani-- is that they don't really have to travel all that far to get to the grimier confines of <i>Some Motherfuckers Gonna Be Walking 'Round With a Size 9 Diehard up Their Ass, Cause Apparently They Ain't Never Seen a Short AC Man Get Bad Ass on Methadone</i>. Just turn the radio dial a little to the left from your mainstream alt-rock station or wait out the next the commercial break of ""120 Minutes"" for the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"" target=""_blank"">the Jesus Lizard</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/521-butthole-surfers/"" target=""_blank"">Butthole Surfers</a> to make their brief flirtations with mainstream attention. Surely, Weird Wives' hearts are in the right place here, but <i>Some Motherfuckers </i> turns out to be the kind of record where you can see where its creators' interests lie and, unfortunately, where their expertise does as well.</p>
<p>At the very least, this isn't some sort of bid to totally negate Surfer Blood's populist charm for acceptance from the academics and arm-crossers. Everything from the album title to Weird Wives' <a href=""http://www.westpalmbeotch.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> to the cover art and the names of most of the songs themselves (""Fresca"", ""Predator 4""), and… well, you'd be forgiven for thinking this was a chillwave record. At some points, it sorta is: Instrumentals ""Alone Times"" and ""Peak Commute"" feature the kind of drippy, amniotic keyboard textures signifying a greyscale rendering of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5277-black-moth-super-rainbow/"" target=""_blank"">Black Moth Super Rainbow</a>. And for the most part, Weird Wives maintain a loose grind, most of <i>Some Motherfuckers </i> cycling through a four-bar pivot where the band locked in and decided to turn it into a four-minute jam.</p>
<p>But while there's plenty of feedback splatter, drone, and flatted-fifth skronk, what Weird Wives lack above all else is a sense of true aggression or purpose. Or at least some impression of danger: this is the sort of thing that works best when something feels like it's at stake, whether it's a show that's verging on police intervention or the sonic excavation of an ugly, malignant tumor that simply couldn't stay inside of its host. Hell, maybe this slays live, and their earlier singles did show some fangs, but Weird Wives' brute force runs up against reverb that deadens <i>Some Motherfuckers </i>like so much pink, puffy insulation. The occasional hook does exist-- the fretboard-corroding riff of ""Plastic Masks"", the headbanger repetition driving ""Michaels"", and heck, the grotty, downstroking post-punk of ""Predator 4"" recalls an ornery <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2112-interpol/"" target=""_blank"">Interpol</a> jacked on truckstop coffee or speed. But they're only hooky within the context of <i>Some Motherfuckers</i>.</p>
<p>Of course, melody isn't paramount in this realm, and you could troubleshoot in the form of a compelling frontman, but Nick Klein (a Weird Wife not from Surfer Blood) sounds uncertain that he's even up for the job. His megaphone yawps blend in just fine with the surrounding sheet-metal timbres, and the occasional lyric you can make out-- ""building new homes"" on ""Gila"", ""It's gonna be one of those nights again"" on ""Predator 4""-- don't really accumulate much tension out of their repetition and instead just sit as vaguely ominous placeholders. But how much of <i>Some Motherfuckers </i>itself is supposed to be a vaguely ominous placeholder instead of a definitive statement from a popular band's side project? That's tougher to parse-- it's easy to understand why Weird Wives felt the desire to make a record like <i>Some Motherfuckers</i>, less so to understand why they felt the need to share it.</p></div>"|15989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15989-some-motherfuckers-gonna-be-walking-round-with-a-size-9-diehard-up-their-ass-cause-apparently-they-aint-never-seen-a-short-ac-man-get-bad-ass-on-methadone/|5.0|Ian Cohen

Both abuse electric guitars; both like to wear black and be photographed by Anton Corbijn; both have indulged in lifestyles that threatened to become <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xcwt9mSbYE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">death</a>-<a href=""http://img242.imageshack.us/img242/7095/alcoholica29669uh2hl8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">styles</a>; both have a habit of alienating their fans by taking <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3WIHtOmkBg&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ill-advised</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMxyIs8MkmU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stylistic detours</a> and, by extension, both are considered by many to be <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2000/05/09/metallica_fan/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">class-A</a> <a href=""http://gawker.com/320862/you-all-knew-that-lou-reed-was-a-jerk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">assholes</a>. But while these surface similarities may provide the two parties with small-talk/commiseration fodder when, say, hanging backstage before <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u7Z51KRlcE&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">murdering ""Sweet Jane"" at a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony</a>, they're pretty miserable grounds for a full-on collaboration, especially one that spans two discs and close to 90 minutes. And yet, showing their usual proud disregard for their fans and music in general, Lou Reed and Metallica have gone and made <i>Lulu</i> anyway.</p>
<p>It'd be one thing if <i>Lulu</i> were being slipped into the marketplace as a low-profile curiosity, akin to a 90s-era spoken word album with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8951RyZByb8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">some alt-rocker screeching away in the background</a>. Instead, it's being trumpeted by its makers as a historic event. In  a now-infamous <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/when-metallica-met-lou-reed-20110930"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich recall  bursting into tears of pride during the recording sessions, while in another Reed  grinningly <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gICB3uwcwz4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">insists</a> that Metallica has ""pushed me to the best I've  ever been."" It was one of many unintentional jokes in an online promo  campaign that effectively ruined <i>Lulu</i>'s chances of being taken seriously before it was even heard.</p>
<p><i>Lulu</i> was first previewed with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr7iWaJraAA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an especially repellent</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZhnTY_tdeU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">30-second tract</a> of ""The View"" that confirmed everyone's worst suspicions of the project-- namely, that Reed's crotchety, atonal poem-rants would be wholly incompatible with Metallica's fidgety riffage. The clip's most prominent lyric (""Throw it away/ For worship someone who actively despises you!"") seemed to mock both artists' most forgiving fans for even clicking on the link. By the time ""The View"" was released in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LWtb621DRg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">its full, five-minute ghastliness</a>-- with Hetfield variously professing himself to be a table, a 10-story building and, possibly, the premier member of Philly hip-hop band <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"" target=""_blank"">the Roots</a>-- the Internet had all the evidence it needed to preemptively crown <i>Lulu</i> <a href=""http://www.wordmagazine.co.uk/content/the-worst-album-all-time"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Worst Album of All Time</a>.</p>
<p>But even in that regard, <i>Lulu</i> disappoints. For all the hilarity that ought to ensue here, <i>Lulu</i> is a frustratingly noble failure. Audacious to the extreme, but exhaustingly tedious as a result, its few interesting ideas are stretched out beyond the point of utility and pounded into submission-- the average song length clocks in at eight excruciating minutes. Still, it's kind of fascinating to hear two veteran entities trying like hell to excavate common ground that simply does not exist.<i> </i></p>
<p><i>Lulu</i>'s source material-- a series of transgressive plays by Munich playwright <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wedekind"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Frank Wedekind</a> about a stripper who becomes a social-climber only to wind up a prostitute-- allows Reed to set a familiar <i>Berlin</i> scene with ""Brandenburg Gate"", a would-be anthem that, with a less torturous delivery, could almost pass for something from Reed's mid-1970s songbook. Instead, we get Hetfield belting out its ""small town girl"" chorus like he's trying to summon the next featured attraction at a strip club.</p>
<p>Reed's influence also feels responsible for the ominous, omnipresent <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvets</a>-esque string textures and a couple of curiously avant guitar solos from Kirk Hammett (see: ""Dragon""). Metallica, meanwhile, inspired Reed to come up with at least one perfectly metal lyric (""I cry icicles in my stein""), while getting him to update the S&amp;M suggestiveness of ""Venus in Furs"" to the bloodlusty standards of the modern-day headbanger. However, a great deal of <i>Lulu</i>'s songs find Reed graphically describing violent, depraved sexual trysts from the female protagonist's perspective, and with lines like ""I will swallow your sharpest cutter like a colored's man dick"" in abundance, some dyed-in-the-denim Metallica fans could be squirming like they did when Kirk <a href=""http://i176.photobucket.com/albums/w193/isabell_spottedfeather/Kirk%20Hammett/349924211.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">started wearing eyeliner</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these small surprises can't save <i>Lulu</i> from the much larger issue that lies directly at its core: For most of  the record, Lou Reed and Metallica barely sound like they're on the same planet, let alone in the same room; the album works neither as powerful rock music nor as an impressionistic soundtrack to a spoken narrative. Reed's monotone remains unresponsive to what's happening around him whether the occasion calls for full-torque thrash (""Mistress Dread"") or dreary acoustic mood pieces (""Little Dog""), while Lars Ulrich's flailing fills during the breakdowns on ""Pumping Blood"" and ""Frustration"" are essentially drummerese for ""what the fuck do I do with this?"" But for all of Reed's meandering, a-melodic verbosity, it's actually Hetfield who sounds the most out of place here; beyond his self-parodic turn on ""The View"", he contributes intrusive back-ups to the bar-band slog ""Iced Honey"" and the maddeningly repetitious ""Cheat on Me"" like someone in the back row of a class photo trying to mug his way into the frame.</p>
<p>Remarkably, there is actually a light at the end of this dark, despairing tunnel-- and, not coincidentally, it's the song least connected to the <i>Lulu</i> concept. Clocking in at an absurd 19 minutes, ""Junior Dad"" is-- like almost everything else here-- too long by half, with its last eight minutes taken up by an extended string drone. But, despite its laughable title, ""Junior Dad"" possesses everything the rest of <i>Lulu</i> doesn't: a graceful, affecting melody, a logical arrangement, a pretty guitar line, a sympathetic narrator and, most importantly, a true synthesis of each principal's strengths, outfitting a Reed streetwise hymn with Metallica's stadium-sized crunch; it's like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkG9BKgDvNI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Street Hassle""</a> refashioned as a <i>Black Album</i> power ballad. ""Junior Dad"" is a song that seemingly does the impossible: it momentarily redeems the idea of a Lou Reed/Metallica collaboration as a plausible, potentially fruitful concept. But its late appearance also serves as a potent reminder of just how terribly that concept is executed on everything that precedes it.</p></div>"|15996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15996-lou-reed-metallica/|1.0|Stuart Berman

Like the work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a>, its emotion-loaded melodies were both whimsical and mournful. Like the collage-funk productions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1931-matthew-herbert/"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Herbert</a>, it built tracks from a myriad of tiny samples, but warped them so that even field recordings and snippets of analog instruments felt denatured, computerized, alien. The production had the crammed-waveform fullness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"" target=""_blank"">the Field</a>'s fluffy maximalist trance epics, but the way GP put his tracks together from all those little bits somehow also recalled the fragile, handmade miniatures of not-quite-dubsteppers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28459-mount-kimbie/"" target=""_blank"">Mount Kimbie</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not GP would claim any or all of those acts as influences or peers, it was clear he was enjoying the same sort of freedom as they did, the freedom of belonging to no one particular electronic music niche. He drew inspiration from sounds as far-flung as the more obvious physicality of London's ever-evolving beats-and-bass subculture, the twitching and gurgling micro-syncopations of experimental techno, and the shameless and affecting melodicism of IDM. More crucially, he also found ways to layer them into something his own. On GP's new <i>DJ-Kicks</i> entry, he attempts to fuse these strands of modern dance, just as he did on <i>Lucky Shiner</i>, except this time using mostly other people's records as raw material. The result is another seeming contradiction, a DJ mix that's both a pulsing paean to up-to-the-minute club rhythms and a total headphone-dependent feast of electronic sound at its most miniaturized and luscious.</p>
<p>He does this quite simply, pairing left-field bangers with tracks that tend more toward the art-techno end of the spectrum, accentuating the subtleties of the former and teasing out the grooves in the latter. And in the mix's most effective moments, he mingles them until they create new hybrids, not quite dancefloor ready and always with so much to <i>listen</i> to that you could never call them ambient. GP draws out the strange staggering gait of Bok Bok's ""Charisma Theme"", what might have seemed like a slab of party-ready bashing and clonking in a mix of similar post-dubstep party tunes, by linking it with the more steely, abstract electro of Decay's ""Charisma's Theme"". He hears a bit of gnarled drums and synthesizer murk, clipped from a Brainiac record of all things, as the perfect perverse segue into Untold and LV's spartan dubstep.  He ranges as far as he ever has on his own records, from Berlin minimal to American indie rock, divining brilliant connections between artists who seem to come from opposing aesthetic universes.</p>
<p>Amazingly, this rarely makes for choppy transitions. Given the wildly disparate materials used to construct it, the bubbling, slurping, rustling flow of this <i>DJ-Kicks</i> is a marvel, the kind of seamless weaving together of tiny sounds into a new tapestry that's been sadly unfashionable since the days of old-school micro-house mixes. And like vintage micro-house, many of the tracks take minimalism not as an opportunity for acetic reduction but a chance to revel in all the ear candy sound-as-sound qualities of electronic music, without totally skimping on the funk. Tune your ears down to its reductionist frequency, and the vinyl-esque crackle and barely audible hiss of Jan Jelinek's ""If's, And's, and But's"" feels as lush and wombing as any massive, bass-booming deep house jam operating on a similarly warm tip. Like the records that make it up, Gold Panda's <i>DJ-Kicks</i> is too interested in these (often literally) small pleasures and subtle entwinings to say it demands your attention. But in his own dogged, idiosyncratic way, he's keeping a neglected strain of dance music alive here, and while the joys are subtle, the more attention you give the mix, the deeper they feel.</p></div>"|15991.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15991-gold-panda-dj-kicks/|7.5|Jess Harvell

That's not to say that this is weird music. It's actually pretty accessible pop music, but something about their song <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12367-little-bit/"" target=""_blank"">""Little Bit""</a> is hard to place. The pitch-perfect execution feels like something you should already know-- a producer retooling a forgotten acapella, maybe, or perhaps a radio cut from a new R&amp;B singer. As it happens neither is exactly true: Pandr Eyez is the work of a London-based duo made up of producer Tom Lloyd and singer Ferren Gipson.</p>
<p>The story is that they met while living in a shared university dormitory then started exchanging musical ideas. Something about that enthusiasm and shared love of certain styles carries over into Pandr Eyez, giving the project an infectious, off-the-cuff energy. That, combined with the absence of samples or acapellas, makes <i>Eyes on You</i> feel both homespun and playful in execution, though perhaps a couple of steps away from <i>""</i>the real thing."" That lingering feeling makes this seem like more of an outside-looking-in take on R&amp;B, and it's tempting to compare it to the kind of thing jj went in for on their mixtape <i>Kills</i>, but this isn't anywhere near as drugged or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IhwBpG8Cjw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sad-eyed</a>.</p>
<p>""Little Bit"" stands out from the rest of their material, with woozy synths and a shuffling beat pushing rhythms in all the right spots. Above that backdrop Gipson buries her verses in rap standards like ""Didn't have too much when we started this game/ Now we're doing alright, check my diamonds and rings."" But lines like those-- and others about brand new kicks, seeing her face on TV, and referencing 16 bars-- sound different coming from what is essentially a bedroom duo rather than guys like <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/27881-8ball/"" target=""_blank"">8Ball</a> and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/28661-mjg/"" target=""_blank"">MJG</a>. There's an element of dress-up to Gipson's lyrics, and a gooey soft center that isn't quite concealed by the fronting. (It's not a million miles away from the effect of Robyn on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdTucUya9YE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Konichiwa Bitches""</a>.)</p>
<p>A lot of the success of these tracks is centered on feel-good vibes though and the impressive production-- handled by the other half of the duo, Tom Lloyd-- goes a long way toward making the record work so well. His beats are characterized by a dreamy feel thanks to the big, romantic synths on all of these tracks, but there's range to his production too. ""Shinin'"", for example cuts a contrast to the rest of the EP's softer palette gliding, instead, on a minimal, deep rumbling bass pattern and cheap sounding samples. It's a slightly harsh exterior, one that Gipson matches toe-to-toe with bravado. The track really takes off towards the end, though, as Lloyd grabs the spotlight, throwing all those cheap samples in the air and letting them drop around each other.</p>
<p>For all their individual nuance and personality, it's clear that the duo have hit a collaborative sweet-spot: Lloyd and Gipson play to each other's strengths and egg each other on at every turn. While there is plenty of recontextualizing rap and R&amp;B going around, the fun of this record is that Pandr Eyez seem to understand that sometimes pop music is just about letting your hair down and singing along in whatever language you can.</p></div>"|15979.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15979-pandr-eyez/|7.9|Hari Ashurst

According to Khan, Reed and Anderson wanted the duo to ""put back the danger into the devil's music."" His antics at the event, which ultimately led to his breakup with <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/5477-mark-sultan/"">Mark Sultan</a>, proved that assessment accurate. His live shows are unpredictable and wild. His music with BBQ, Tandoori Knights, and the Shrines is driven by an energetic, fiery soul that jumps straight out of the 1950s and 1960s-- a time when several of pop music's central characters were handsome, wild-eyed men screaming and pushing that ""devil’s music"" to America's children. King Khan is the same sort of dangerous and then some: He's usually shirtless (in the very least) and he unleashes Wilson Pickett shrieks, exudes grease and sex, and has a knack for being gratuitously crass.</p>
<p>That's why this Scion EP by ""the King Khan Experience"" is so disappointing. The palpable feeling of danger from Khan's work never comes into play. Where his material with the Shrines felt like a sharp rock and soul review, the Experience comparatively sags. The Shrines' <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10378-what-is/"" target=""_blank"">What Is?!</a></i> was backed by a tight horn section and some on-point melody-accenting guitars. Meanwhile, the Experience features organ and poorly utilized horns. Many of the reference points seem to come less from the 60s and more from the indulgent, jammy 70s-- the wandering organ and the loose blues guitar solo of ""Knock Me Off My Feet"" feel sloppy in comparision to past material. What's worse, Khan sounds tired. His vocals frequently drag, and even his ""OWW""'s come off less wild than usual.</p>
<p>A few songs hint at the electrifying promise he made with the Shrines, but they ultimately slip up somewhere. The opening guitar and percussion drive of ""Come Levitate With Me"" sound like they're about to build into a party song, but then the song just slows down with a Herbie Mann-ish flute solo and Khan's monotonous, dragging vocals. ""I Got Love"" is the song that begs for horns and speed, but neither happen. The only track that truly hits is his tribute to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7921-jay-reatard/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Reatard</a>: ""Hammer Ich Vermisse Dich"", a German cover of Reatard's ""Hammer I Miss You"". It’s unclear why the song is in German, but through the language barrier, you can hear Khan's passionate delivery. He's backed on the chorus by what sounds like German schoolgirls, and there's glitchy percussion driving the whole thing. It’s a touching tribute to his friend, if only from the titular message: ""I miss you.""</p>
<p>Maybe the EP was a place to put out some odds and ends that don't have a clear place with any of his other bands-- it really does sound like a hodgepodge. We get ""Are You Serious?"", a lo-fi goof on Jimi Hendrix's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvXstzHzkXk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Wind Cries Mary""</a> and<i> Are You Experienced</i>. (The song might explain the new band name.) He also offers ""Keep It Simple Stupid"", a bit of clichéd Eastern psych with a too-long whine. There <i>is</i> ""Bob Log Stomp"", a track that would fit tidily with BBQ or the Shrines, but it's basically a ""somebody pooped in my scotch"" joke, and it's not even as funny as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdRBAdzNhsw&amp;amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tastebuds""</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout<i></i>, we get a  shadow of Khan as ""wild man"" as joker as rocker. His best work comes from a place that's  unhinged. This material's too toned-down and wandering. In ""I Got Love"", he sings: ""It's a question of soul/ Some people got it and some people don't."" This turns out to be a supremely a misplaced lyric on an EP where the man's delivery is so flat.</p></div>"|15980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15980-the-king-khan-experience-scion-av-presents-the-king-khan-experience/|5.3|Evan Minsker

With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13954-eyelid-movies/"" target=""_blank""><i>Eyelid Movies</i></a>, their debut full-length from last year, the rhythm-heavy foundations and a twilight-lit mix of melody felt streamlined, yet still demonstrated vision and character. Taking cues from trip-hop and dream pop (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"" target=""_blank"">Portishead</a> seem to be an important reference point), they never seemed shy about being upfront with their influences. Despite cryptically nicknaming their sound ""street beat,"" the tag made some sense-- the hard-edged urgency of said beats undercutting such lush romanticism felt perfectly suited for those long, late staggers home. So it's with the appropriately titled <i>Nightlife</i> EP that we find the twosome refining and tweaking some of the ideas put forth on its debut without entirely resting on its laurels, and offering a few of the band's best songs to date.</p>
<p>In a press release, Carter explained that <i>Nightlife</i> ""couldn't have been written anywhere other than in clubs and hotel rooms during this experience we've been having for the last year or two,"" describing the time Phantogram has spent promoting <i>Eyelid Movies</i>. The nocturnal states that often accompany life on the road have proved beneficial in the case of <i>Nightlife</i>, convincing the duo to push their music outside of their collective headspace and into a more social setting. Bands trying to provide an honest snapshot of a night out on the town often fall short by focusing solely on the highs of the party (those are included here too, of course), but Phantogram seem to find just as much clarity in the comedown (""It's a new day, and I got new ways of turning into stone,"" goes the chorus on ""Turning Into Stone""). As much as you can move to <i>Nightlife</i>, moments of austerity and romance are still guiding lights here-- when measured correctly, Barthel and Carter are often able to craft appealing, ambidextrous tracks that feel suited for dancefloors as well as the backs of cabs.</p>
<p>Part of this notably animated reupholstering likely has something to do with that fact that Phantogram have been performing live as a trio, with Tim Oakley handling drum duties. And while Carter is in charge of all things drum-oriented on <i>Nightlife</i>, the temporary change-up clearly made its mark, as Phantogram sounds more like a bonafide rock band and less like the flimsy pop act they could've dissolved into. Take single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12544-dont-move/"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Move""</a>, a dance track that feels perfectly proportioned for starry eyes in close quarters. But look closer, and you'll find a proper heir to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11887-the-top-the-head-on-the-door-kiss-me-kiss-me-kiss-me-blue-sunshine/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me</i></a>-styled bombast, complete with horn clippings, Middle Eastern vocal samples, and marching band drum rolls. And while the Mazzy Star-esque coda that reduces the appealing bass knocks on ""Turning Into Stone"" into something plush and more intimate might not be necessary, it all suggests that this is a more realized pop voice willing to expand, experiment with and reinvigorate their sound.</p>
<p>Not everything here is as compelling, but the true takeaways (the first three cuts, including the outsized, life-affirming ""16 Years"") are well worth the misguided ambition and watered down moments that inhabit the EP's second half. Closer ""A Dark Tunnel"" means to shade the buzzing urgency of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9177-return-to-cookie-mountain/"" target=""_blank""><i>Return to Cookie Mountain</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a> but misses the mark; squint hard enough and you'll see that ""Nightlife"" probably isn't going to succeed in any context outside of a CW show.

This fact should surprise no one who has heard the Decemberists, or who has only so much as read one of their press clippings, nearly all of which seem bound, as if by secret contract, to make mention of the music as ""literate."" It's shorthand, of course, for Meloy's tendency towards narrative and metaphor and occasionally inscrutable vocabulary-- a way for writers to telegraph his interest in words without indulging in much of the same.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The matter of the L-word has been the primary talking point about the band since Portland's HUSH records released their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2240-5-songs-ep/"" target=""_blank"">first EP</a> nearly a decade ago, joined in 2006 by their signing to Capitol, and earlier this year by the somewhat surprising debut of their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15000-the-king-is-dead/"" target=""_blank"">sixth album</a> at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41351-the-decemberists-have-the-number-one-album/"" target=""_blank"">number one on the Billboard charts</a>. Somewhere in there, too, is nearly always talk of Meloy's glasses (well, he wears them) and a mention of the band's fans, usually classified as gawking drama-club nerds (which are indeed there, though for a while now the crowds at their live shows have been comprised less of folks in ""three-button vests"" and more in just plain t-shirts, usually also in pants). To echo an old trope (one that sounds, by coincidence, like the premise of a Decemberists song), the cobbler's children have no shoes: The band that's done more than almost any other in recent years for the art of narrative songcraft can't seem to get a decent story told about its own damn self.</p>
<p>But the release of <i>Long Live the King</i>, the follow-up EP to the chart-topping <i>The King Is Dead</i>, offers as good a chance as we may get for a while to pause and take stock of what we might have been missing. The six songs comprise a few nearly-fleshed-out tracks and one demo rescued from the cutting-room floor (plus a previously-released cover of the Grateful Dead's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFvuo6keto"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Row Jimmy</a>"", which the band sounds like they had a good time recording, making it at least a slight improvement over any of the seven hundred thousand versions of the Dead's original). It's not a cohesive artistic effort so much as a jumble of remainders-- unhemmed, lots of loose strings. Still, like rifling through a quilter's scrap bag, it's easy to see what bits were trimmed off from where, and worth it to see how they now might be put to their own uses.</p>
<p>Even moreso than the album they were axed from, these songs are heavy on the literary references; ""Sonnet"", in particular, reconstitutes a Dantean ode to bromance as a jaunty folk romp, punctuated by the welcome, if not a bit startling, appearance of a horn section. But as always, the bookish nods aren't the most interesting things going. Running throughout <i>The King Is Dead</i> and present here too are some striking examples of what may be Meloy's secret strength as a songwriter: not the dispatching of triple-word-score contenders or the re-imagining of ancient archetypes, but the mining of the emotional and physical expanses that separate and unite his characters, who seem to be growing more and more real all the time. Turns out, the fabulist is a humanist, too.</p>
<p>Earlier Decemberists songs tended towards thumbnail sketches of individuals-- ghost-babies, destitute barrow boys, slain soldiers. The scope was narrow, a few degrees removed from reality, and focused on death. On <i>Long Live the King</i>, though, when there is killing, we remain fully topside of the grave, and though it may not always be brighter, the emphasis is on the living. More and more now there are songs about ""we's,"" about collective efforts, about sharing the load. (It's not surprising, then, that the stage musical Meloy has been working on for years is about an early-20th-century miners' strike.) <i>The King Is Dead </i>opened with ""Don't Carry It All"" and its cryptic reassurance that ""we are all our hands and holders,"" and while there's nothing so frankly heartening on the EP, the spirit appears in flashes.</p>
<p>Everything here is a group effort: the murder of ""E. Watson"", the interring of ""Burying Davy"". These two opening tracks have less of the sunny, rough-handed looseness of the best tracks of <i>The King Is Dead</i>, perhaps explaining their exclusion. Texturally and technically, the shambly home recording of ""I4U &amp; U4ME"" sounds more like a lost track from Meloy's college band Tarkio; it's been since ""Angel, Won't You Call Me?"", on The Decemberists' very first EP, that he, in character or otherwise, has offered himself for a romantic partnership with such indifference: ""We could go together some/ And we could get each other through the night."" It's a jangly, sweet, impatient song, and it's a bummer that it may languish here in demo form for all time; if anything, it would be great to have version where ""fouled up,"" on the pre-chorus, becomes ""fucked up,"" which it seems so badly to want to be.</p>
<p>""Foregone"" is one of Meloy's more directly personal lyrics, and while it might've been right at home on the LP with its shuffling swagger and twanging pedal steel, coupled with ""Rise to Me"" it would have made two references to Meloy's son Henry in one song-cycle. This might be edging a little too close to home for a band whose previous album, after all, exclusively detailed the troubled love life of a shape-shifting foster son of an evil fairy queen. (Like it or not, and many will not, echoes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12842-the-hazards-of-love/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Hazards of Love </i></a>still linger here: ""Burying Davy"" is taut and ominous, the band seeming happy to slip back into the prog-folk murk that this writer occasionally feels pretty lonely in not considering a total career misstep.)</p>
<p>Earlier this year, casual mentions of an extended Decemberists hiatus were met with knuckle-gnawing from fans, but especially given this EP, those laments seem premature. The act is a collective of its own, of course, and right now there are other things to tend to: Meloy is writing a young-adult book series; drummer John Moen, bassist Nate Query and guitarist Chris Funk all juggle a number of other bands, as does organist Jenny Conlee, who we're happy to hear has <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44378-the-decemberists-jenny-conlees-cancer-in-remission/"" target=""_blank"">kicked her breast cancer</a> into remission. This isn't the sound of a band closing up shop so much as tidying up the workbench before stepping out for a while. <i>Long Live the King </i>would surely have been an apt title for a swan song, but this isn't one.</p></div>"|15985.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15985-long-live-the-king-ep/|6.8|Rachael Maddux

Covering 10 tracks in a scant 22 minutes and bearing a forehead-slap obvious title that probably existed before the project did, <i>Black and Brown</i> is hastily assembled, thoughtlessly sequenced, and conspicuously truncated. There are two songs, back to back, titled ""WTF"" and ""LOL"". Four songs don't exceed the two-minute mark.  The overwhelming impression is that the EP exists because an assistant stumbled across an ""in-progress"" folder of mp3s on Black Milk's desktop and leaked the results.</p>
<p>And yet, Black Milk is one of indie rap's best and most reliable producers, and Danny Brown, fresh off his brilliant <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15753-xxx/"" target=""_blank"">XXX</a></i>, is riding a white-hot creative streak: which means that <i>Black and Brown</i> is 22 hastily assembled, thoughtlessly sequenced minutes of vivid beats and incredible rapping.   Black Milk's beats are boilerplate Black Milk-- post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">Dilla</a> instrumentals hitched to hard-knocking drums-- and Brown brings none of the songwriting skill or emotional range  that marked <i>XXX</i>, with its tales of stripping hot water heaters from abandoned houses and harrowing accounts of substance abuse. It's a low-stakes affair, aiming at nothing more than head nods, but it induces some deep ones.</p>
<p>Brown tamps down the keening high edge in his voice, with the result that he sounds more like Pharaohe Monch than usual. Lyrically, he mostly coasts, but even on autopilot he remains absurdly quotable. ""Morphine metaphors make you do the shoulder lean,"" he spits on ""Loosie"", and the line is a finely tuned mini-marvel of alliteration and craft. Few rappers are as creatively disgusting as Brown-- his missing tooth is ""perfect for lickin clits,"" he informs a potential partner-- but even his shock raps hit their target, more often than not, through some deft bit of linguistic three-card Monte: ""Used to make out with runaways in crack houses/ Now I run away from making out with brick houses,"" he leers on ""Loosie"". Got that?</p>
<p>Black Milk's production, meanwhile, continues his career-long argument for the power of immacuately prepared comfort food. His work gathers a lot of strength from old-fashioned flipped samples, but the sound he wrings from them is compellingly tactile, as if the samples were made of some dense-but-yielding material only he knows how to manipulate. His drums have so much character and texture they almost seem to hit twice; ""Zap""'s bone-jarring backbeat lands somewhere indistinct in headphone-space, over a feebly quavering mini-choir of chipmunk-soul voices, and it sounds like you could reach out and run your fingers over it. Milk switches the beat up every one or two minutes, like impatient channel flicking, which both reinforces the beat-tape feeling of <i>Black and Brown</i> and handily keeps it from getting boring.  The whole EP is over seemingly as soon as it begins and is the definition of a simple A+B proposition, right down to its name. But it works, and if it means there's a more considered full-length from these two on the way, even better.</p></div>"|15987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15987-black-and-brown/|6.5|Jayson Greene

For starters, guitarist/lyricist/songwriter John Cobbett-- of recently disbanded SF black  metal group Ludicra and onetime member of comrades-in-classic-metal/sister band Slough Feg-- has again retooled his rotating cast: Longtime drummer Chewy Marzolo returns, as do more recent additions Sigrid Sheie (organ) and Max Barnett (bass), but this is the first HoM album to feature guitarist Leila Abdul-Rauf (Saros, Amber  Asylum, Vastum) and power-piped vocalist Joe Hutton (the Worship of  Silence).</p>
<p>The band, which debuted in 2001 with the  three-part rock opera <i>The Bastard</i>, have never shied from ambition. When <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/features/show-no-mercy/7534-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank"">I  spoke with Cobbett in 2008</a>, he said HoM's 2003 sophomore collection <i>The August Engine</i> was his ""first attempt"" to make an album as big as <i>The Wall</i>. 2008's sprawling<i> Fields</i>/<i>Church of Broken Glass</i>, two  individual concept albums packaged together, was his second. But the music Cobbett writes is  detailed enough that he doesn't  need to fill four sides of vinyl to make his point. He's finally figured that out on <i>17th Street</i>.</p>
<p>At a time when fans can get caught-up on how fast someone solos, or how ominous a back story they have to offer, HoM shake aside gimmicks and play classic progressive metal in a way that makes room for thrash, doom, NWOBHM, and legit hooks alongside honest feeling and larger concepts. Cobbett didn't spell out the specifics in the record's accompanying press materials; his songwriting and lyrics are evocative enough that it isn't necessary. These are songs about gentrification (in his hometown and elsewhere), paeans to areas of San Francisco, and stories about individuals living out their lives in those spaces-- though it's easy to ignore all of that and just go along for the air-guitaring.</p>
<p>Cobbett's said working with Abdul-Rauf got him to return to writing  songs for the electric guitar, a claim consistently backed up by this record's incredibly emotive, vintage riffs. On opener ""317"", guitars entangle with a swaggering, synchronized momentum until one spirals out like  the album cover's splayed lights of San Francisco. Two and a half  minutes of instrumental music pass before Hutton gets all Walt Whitman with it: ""We are the soil becoming dust/ We are the chrome becoming rust,"" etc. But even without the voice, the song's plenty expressive. It's followed by the the speedier, punchier ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12480-17th-street/"" target=""_blank"">17th Street</a>"" with its doubled female harmonies, slick (then crunchy) guitars, and spacious organ. Lyrically, it's a focused study of a ""ruthless"" street outside a window (in, what you expect, is any city, anywhere), reminiscent of William T. Vollmann's descriptions of the Tenderloin district. Musically, it gallops, but maintains a 1970s airiness.</p>
<p>The best track, ""The Grain"", is a seven-minute ""love"" song that has guitars mirroring the vocal lines amid a number of space-stretching pastoral breakdowns. It culminates, over and over, with an anthemic multi-person chorus that you'll try to sing along with even if you can't possibly hit the notes. As far as these sorts of moments go, there's also ""The Day the City Died"", an ode to those cities and the places their inhabitants are heading: ""This one's called I'm getting addicted/ This one's called I'm getting evicted/ This one's called another one moving away."" It has a punkier vibe, but filtered through flamboyant 80s metal and, of course, scorching guitar solos. There's also a seven-minute piano-powered ballad, ""Summer Tears"", that had me reaching for my Queensryche albums for the first time since high school.</p>
<p>That's important.<i> 17th Street</i> <i>is</i> one of those metal albums that could appeal to fans of Judas Priest, Rush, Thin Lizzy, Iron Maiden, Dream Theater-- lifers not in the know about the current underground, who would stumble upon these 50 minutes of old-school riffing and (actual) singing and fall in love. And, even if you have been keeping track of what's bubbling beneath the mainstream, this is in a class of its own. Cobbett's a talent, one who makes well-considered, carefully crafted music, the kind of stuff that would work well in stadiums if metal of this sort could still fill them.</p></div>"|15990.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15990-17th-street/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

Excluding live performances, the San Francisco musician sets and triggers every sound associated with <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thesoftmoon/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Soft Moon</a>, drawing from the coldest, most metallic zeniths of post-punk and industrial rock. He builds isolation out of isolation, almost to the point that he's entirely removed as a presence; when he sings, he's less a personality than an instrument in the mix, hissing and howling like busted pipes in an abandoned factory. The work collected on the Soft Moon's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14997-the-soft-moon/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled LP</a> from last year, as well as this year's follow-up EP, <i>Total Decay</i>, are singular and self-contained, like nightmares. A typical piece starts suddenly and without warning, and ends with equal subtlety, like someone flipping off a light switch (or, given the music's dark antagonism, turning it on). Even though there are other acts in the Bay Area that enjoy their share of ear-bleeding noise (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29185-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Weekend</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"" target=""_blank"">Thee Oh Sees</a> if you catch them at the right moment), don't bother trying to place Vasquez amidst the area's growing circle of visible indie musicians. He's working in a class of his own.</p>
<p>Notice that I haven't used the word ""songs"" to describe the result of Vasquez's creative process. That's because the Soft Moon aren't really about ""songs,"" per se; they're about moods, how they're conveyed, and the specific images they conjure. On <i>The Soft Moon</i>, the titles ascribed to the music were all the lyrics one needed (and, more often than not, was given), and that practice continues on <i>Total Decay</i>. Besides sounding like Joy Division <i>and</i> bearing the name of what sounds like a potential Joy Division song title, the most notable element of ""Repetition"" is its-- you guessed it-- repeating bassline, sinisterly gyrating in place while whimpered buzzing and oscillating machines rise and fall around it. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12362-total-decay/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>'s zombie-eyed buzzsaws sound like the aural equivalent of having your skin slowly ripped off, while ""Visions"" takes a feral drum circle and throws space-disco drum machines into the mix, a combo queasy enough to make even the steeliest soothsayer run from the opium den, hopelessly choking back vomit.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this isn't the type of immediate, accessible stuff that casual observers might expect from Captured Tracks, a label that stakes its chips as much on M.O.R. indie-pop like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27968-beach-fossils/"" target=""_blank"">Beach Fossils</a> as on chilly synths and brutal coldwave (although they've been focusing a lot more on the latter in the last 12 months). When Vasquez decides to create something like an actual <i>song</i>, though, the results are undeniable. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12085-when-its-over/"" target=""_blank"">""When It's Over""</a>, a highlight from <i>The Soft Moon</i>, smoldered with sexual confusion and the allure of 4AD's shoegaze glory days; here, it's the title track that burns brightest, a mass-murderer of an anti-anthem that features Vasquez front and (kind of) center, eliciting a high-pitched whine delivered with terrifying slowness amidst the track's hurtling, noisebombing destruction. There's an urge to compare ""Total Decay"" to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"" target=""_blank"">Nine Inch Nails</a>, but there's no angst or frustrated feelings to be found here-- just emptiness, and whatever baggage you bring along with you.</p>
<p>If <i>Total Decay</i>'s composition amounted to the spoils of its title track repeated four times over, it'd simply be <i>too much</i>, which highlights Vasquez's ability to conjure different sounds and styles track-by-track. However, that fact also points out how the Soft Moon's brand of cold, nocturnal malevolence works best in small smatterings. At first, I found myself underwhelmed by <i>Total Decay</i>, because I wanted <i>more</i> than what amounts to 14 minutes of new material following the promise of <i>The Soft Moon</i>; over time, though, I came to realize that the EP's controlled-dosage brevity is exactly what makes it rise above its predecessor. It's short and intense, and accordingly it hits hard and leaves enough of a lasting bruise on you that you can't help but touch it, just to feel the pain again.</p></div>"|15988.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15988-total-decay-ep/|7.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

The London imprint, partly known for launching bass hotshots <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28578-kingdom/"" target=""_blank"">Kingdom</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29250-girl-unit/"" target=""_blank"">Girl Unit</a>, employs stylistically diverse artists, and there's never been a convenient tag like ""purple"" or ""rave-house"" to pin on them. Label founders <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LVis1990"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L-Vis 1990</a> and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/djbokbok"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bok Bok</a> even stress this in interviews. ""We've always hated any genre associations with our music and I think it's pretty impossible to label it, it's just held together by a vibe,"" <a href=""http://www.thefatclub.com/featured/interview-l-vis-1990/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the former said</a> a little ways back. This slipperiness has served Night Slugs well, but at a certain point you want something a little more concrete-- what is that vibe, exactly?</p>
<p><i>Neon Dreams</i>, the solo debut from L-Vis 1990 (real name James Connolly) does not answer this question. If Night Slugs' loose guiding principle up until now has been a colorful counterweight to dubstep and grime's murk and grit, <i>Neon Dreams</i> spins that idea in a hundred different directions. The record is (sometimes intriguingly, often frustratingly) all over the place. The starting point, though, seems to be pop. From the album title and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>-esque cover art to the use of guest vocalists, it's clear that Connolly is interested in making songs rather than just club tracks. And sometimes he does this really well. On ""Tonight"", for example, he throws some 1980s radio sheen on stuttery disco-house and winds up with catchy, retro-futurist boogie.</p>
<p>""Play It Cool"", arguably the best song here, also fits into this pop mode. Gooey synths, heavy drama, breathy female vocals-- it nails a very specific kind of dark and dreamy electro-pop. (Worth noting that it fits comfortably alongside such 2011 standouts as the aforementioned <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>, Neon Indian's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15817-era-extrana/"" target=""_blank""><i>Era Extraña</i></a>, and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/"" target=""_blank""><i>Drive</i> soundtrack</a>.) If Connolly had extended this format (or even this vibe) throughout the album, the rest of it may have been as successful, but instead he incorporates so, so many other sounds. There's a different style on almost every track. You've got a quirky, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/909-chromeo/"" target=""_blank"">Chromeo</a>-style one, some brooding instrumental ones, one where a dude talks quasi-motivationally over revved up Chicago house, and so forth.</p>
<p>None of these tracks are particularly bad; it's simply a case of too much. Too many songs with varying themes and no overarching vision to tie them together. It feels more like taking in a label compilation where you're hopping from one artist's style to the next, and even if that were the case I'd still probably say the sequencing is off. But it's possible that this is precisely Connolly's point-- to make something boundary-less and genre-agnostic, in line with the anything-goes Night Slugs ideology. Bass music, after all, is an ever-evolving thing, generating new sub-strains as fast as you can count them, and this corrals a bunch in one place. Still, offer a bunch of diversions instead of a clear path, and folks might get lost along the way.</p></div>"|15982.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15982-neon-dreams/|6.2|Joe Colly

But <i>A Very She &amp; Him Christmas</i> actually isn't hateable enough. Whether you come to praise or bury it, you're looking for something ultra-campy, overloaded with rampant corniness and gratuitous special guests, the holiday equivalent of Jenny Lewis' cover of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXh94o7tAxQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Handle With Care""</a>. Nah though. No Ben Gibbard, no Will Ferrell, no Mark Wahlberg, nobody. Lots of guitar-and-vocal skeletal sparseness, reaching for transcendent Charlie Brown melancholia but arriving instead at something merely dour. She sings, ""They know that Santa's on his way,"" as though ""Santa"" were actually a plague of locusts. She should've recorded this while drunk.</p>
<p>Oh, now, though, these songs are fine, fine. ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"" has a nearly erotic rockabilly sashay, and M. Ward solos with economical dexterity throughout, and improves the record exponentially when his grumbly vocals first kick in on the shuffling ""Christmas Wish""; their voices are lovely when intertwined, and at least offer a whiff of transcendent melancholia. Your crucial jam here is ordinarily immensely problematic yuletide sexual-predator anthem ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"", America's first taste of her vocal talents via <i>Elf</i>, the gender roles now swapped so Zooey bars the door and M. wonders what's in this drink; she blows through her lines in a zippy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8565-eleanor-friedberger/"" target=""_blank"">Eleanor Friedberger</a> jumble, finally loosening up.</p>
<p>Most of the rest is just retightened Don't Fuck It Up competence, alas-- nothing you could call sacrilege, especially given that any Christmas-themed song that does not explicitly praise the birth of Jesus is technically sacrilege. Her ""Blue Christmas"" is alright but can't touch <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUELu8o5KJg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Porky Pig's</a>; her ""Little Saint Nick"" is alright but can't touch <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDkRvfo8jVE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Denver and the Muppets'</a>. They add an extra beat to ""Sleigh Bells"" so as to feel all musical. They attempt to redeem the irredeemable ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" and nearly succeed; they attempt to add gratuitous gravitas to a solo-Zooey ""Silver Bells"" and fail. (Step away from the ukulele, first of all, and it's hard to sell the line, ""And above all this bustle you hear,"" when <i>there ain't no bustle</i>.) ""The Christmas Song"" closes us out similarly too prim and grim, but it'll nonetheless ably soundtrack quite a few Xmas-morning marriage proposals amongst happy couples who also knitted each other sweaters to complement their reindeer-besieged wool pajama pants. (Cotton, make that cotton.)</p>
<p>It'd be nice to make even more cheap children's librarian jokes, but they played this one too safe. For a record whose immediate cultural precedent is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g947151eKQo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pomplamoose's Hyundai ads</a>, this should have been way more polarizing. Savage the Kinks' ""Father Christmas"", excavate Paul McCartney's mega-twee ""Wonderful Christmastime"", give Vince Guaraldi's grave a few spins, <i>something</i>. No, for schadenfreude proceed directly to Scott Weiland's <i>A Methadone Christmas</i> or whatever it's called; <i>A Very She &amp; Him</i> stands guilty not of being oppressively adorkable, but of being not nearly adorkable enough.</p></div>"|15970.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15970-a-very-she-him-christmas/|5.3|Rob Harvilla

Up till now, this early-1980s D.C.-area hardcore quartet's entire discography (aside from a few compilation tracks) could be heard in under 16 minutes-- and not even on a proper full-length but a split LP, shared with the equally obscure Faith.</p>
<p>There's something about that split, though. Thanks to devoted bloggers and high-profile superfans like Damian Abraham and Matt Korvette (of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5160-fucked-up/"" target=""_blank"">Fucked Up</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5308-pissed-jeans/"" target=""_blank"">Pissed Jeans</a>, respectively), hardcore has become something of a scholarly discipline in recent years, and few records are more revered in that DIY academia than 1982's so-called <i>Faith/Void</i>. Drummer Aesop Dekker (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4892-agalloch/"" target=""_blank"">Agalloch</a>, ex-Ludicra) quipped, ""Faith v. Void (1982), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court that overturned mediocrity in hardcore splits."" Sam McPheeters (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/430-born-against/"" target=""_blank"">Born Against</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2975-mens-recovery-project/"" target=""_blank"">Men's Recovery Project</a>, and more) dubbed it one of ""the best records of the 20th century."" And none other than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"" target=""_blank"">Bill ""Smog"" Callahan</a> named a song after the damn thing (""Faith/Void,"" from 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12929-sometimes-i-wish-we-were-an-eagle/"" target=""_blank"">Sometimes I Wish I Were an Eagle</a></i>). ""It's one of my favorite records,"" he told <i>Impose</i>, ""especially the Void side.""</p>
<p>There's no denying the bottled-lightning brilliance of said side-- a sputtering, cacophonous masterpiece, the unhinged id to the comparatively orderly ego of fellow Washingtonians <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2891-minor-threat/"" target=""_blank"">Minor Threat</a>-- but when considering its sterling reputation, you have to factor in its singularity. Underground obsessives love not just the music, but also the idea that Void made one perfect half of one record and that's pretty much it. (That might be why you don't hear too much about <i>Potion for Bad Dreams</i>, the never-released but widely fileshared LP that Void cut for Touch and Go after the Faith split.)</p>
<p>So in issuing <i>Sessions 1981-83</i>, a compilation of demos and rarities spanning Void's brief career (except for two outtakes from the split itself and two 1983 live tracks, everything here predates <i>Faith/Void</i>), is Dischord downgrading the band's priceless cachet? In one sense, maybe so, since these sides humanize Void. Listening to the initial 30 of the comp's 34 tracks, sourced from the quartet's first two studio visits in November and December of 1981, you quickly realize that Void's members weren't unsocialized head cases who managed to focus long enough only to record 12 exquisitely fucked-up songs. On the contrary, vocalist John Weiffenbach, guitarist Bubba Dupree, bassist Chris Stover, and drummer Sean Finnegan (sadly deceased as of 2008), were angry, sometimes goofy suburban kids from Columbia, Md., playing hard, writing prolifically, and steadily developing the confidence to embrace pure, howling chaos-- not so different, in other words, from all the other high-school-aged architects of hardcore across the U.S. The majority of <i>Sessions 1981-83</i> doesn't transcend its genre the way Void's contribution to <i>Faith/Void</i> does, but it does provide enlightening context for that deservedly obsessed-over release.</p>
<p>Just as importantly, this stuff is good, snotty fun. Void's bread and butter was the turbo-speed rant, and the November '81 recordings here feature many prime examples, like the self-explanatory ""Suburbs Suck"", ""Annoyed"", and ""Don't Wanna Be Like You"", which last 38, 28, and 49 seconds, respectively. These songs may represent rock's lowest common denominator-- a pair of buzzsaw riffs, a coming-off-the-rails oompah beat, and a litany of adolescent gripes-- but Void's disaffection is the kind you can't fake, the definition of troubled teenhood.</p>
<p>Unlike Minor Threat's Ian MacKaye, whose cogent statements clued you in to a sharp political mind, Weiffenbach's raw-nerve howl often gave voice to straight-up nihilism; witness <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjfMsxgOclw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""War Hero""</a> (which would later appear on <i>Faith/Void</i>), with its ""I want to die… in a war!"" refrain. But just when you think you have Void pegged as one-note rageaholics, they surprise you with a bit of poignant social commentary (""Black, Jewish, and Poor"", where Weiffenbach's slurred, sneering voice sounds like the blueprint for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/"" target=""_blank"">Wavves</a>' Nathan Williams) or charming self-satire (""Please Give Us a Chance"", which disclaims, ""Just because Chris sucks shit on bass/ Just because Sean can't keep up a beat/ Just because Bubba doesn't know any chords/ Just because I don't know my words…""). Void shouldn't have been so hard on themselves: As primitive as this material is, much of it is unshakably catchy, especially ""Organized Sports"" and ""My Rules"" (both re-recorded for the split), which feature anthemic choruses driven by Dupree's metallic midtempo crunch.</p>
<p>Even as the 1981-model Void were learning how to write effectively in the still-nascent hardcore mode, they were also beginning to deconstruct the form. Right from the beginning, the band wantonly tested the limits of what a song could be. Consider ""Draft Me Please"", which moves from a textbook speed-punk verse into a weird pile-up of a chorus; here, Dupree peels off a snarling phrase, and Finnegan answers with a series of impressionistic taps, abandoning the beat in the process. For a few frantic seconds, the whole band jettisons the idea of tempo, to intoxicating effect.</p>
<p>These chaotic episodes would become more and more pronounced, until they were as much a part of Void's compositional style as the more intelligible material. The most valuable aspect of <i>Sessions 1981-83</i> is how it illustrates this steady march toward violent abstraction, especially in Dupree's playing. As wild as his bandmates were, the half-black, half-Filipino guitarist was a maniac of a different order, the X-factor that gave Void a whiff of dangerous insanity. (Dave Grohl, an avowed Void fan, was among those taking note; he tapped Dupree for a frenetic cameo on his 2004 <i>Probot</i> record.)</p>
<p>The three versions of ""Dehumanized"" here-- one apiece from November and December of '81, and a June 1982 outtake from the session that yielded Void's contributions to <i>Faith/Void</i>-- tell the story plainly. Listening to them in succession, you hear Dupree's ""Eureka!"" awakening to the aesthetic potential of noise. On the first attempt, he plays the dutiful riff machine, clearly stating the song's start-stop verse motif and chugging, downstroked chorus. During the much faster December take, he fills the gaps in the first verse with bursts of feedback; by verse two, he's in full-on assault mode, scraping out tortured growls and squeals that make <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"" target=""_blank"">Black Flag</a>'s Greg Ginn, hardcore's most notorious six-string sicko, sound cautious by comparison. The final ""Dehumanized"" is a glorious mess, with Dupree alternating between proto-thrash attack and what sounds like a malfunctioning power saw. Weiffenbach responds with a borderline black-metal snarl, and we're finally hearing the band at its peak derangement.</p>
<p><i>Sessions 1981-83</i> offers one final masochistic delight: a 1983 live version of <i>Faith/Void</i>'s concluding track, ""Explode"", which feels like the missing link between hardcore and ruthless modern-day noise. ""Our last song,"" Weiffenbach blankly announces, and Stover launches into a manic cyclical bass riff. Dupree answers with a gradually accelerating throb; Weiffenbach lets out a tortured yowl; and suddenly the full band whooshes in. The aural dogpile that follows out-extremes even the hallowed split LP. It bears little resemblance to punk rock, or any sort of song-based soundmaking; instead, it's a mini exorcism that places Void in the illustrious lineage of amplified din, stretching from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1923-jimi-hendrix/"" target=""_blank"">Jimi Hendrix</a> up through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2044-keiji-haino/"" target=""_blank"">Keiji Haino</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"" target=""_blank"">Prurient</a>. Appropriately, it's Dupree we hear last, conjuring spiky, alien sound shapes.</p>
<p>If the rest of <i>Sessions 1981-83</i> serves as a entertaining and educational scrapbook, this track reminds you why, three decades on, Void are still spoken of in hushed tones. Much like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/"" target=""_blank"">John Coltrane</a> toward the end of his life, this band, near the conclusion of its own too-short existence, pierced the veil separating its musical style from an ultimate, unbound-by-genre catharsis. Not bad for a couple of pissed-off suburban kids.</p></div>"|15969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15969-sessions-198183/|7.3|Hank Shteamer

Baton Rouge's <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/youngbleed1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Young Bleed</a> was one of <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/masterp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Master P</a>'s many late-1990s marketing successes. 1998's <i>My Balls and My Word</i> sold half a million copies-- not Mystikal-levels, but certainly a respectable number for a 20-year-old rapper advertised solely in No Limit liner notes and the pages of <i>Murder Dog </i>magazine. Since that time, Young Bleed has continued to release material, with his trademark laconic delivery effortlessly masking suave precision. Now his alliance with Tech N9ne's Strange Music label has found the rapper releasing his best collection of songs since 1999's Priority Records release <i>My Own</i>.</p>
<p><i>Preserved</i> could easily describe Young Bleed's loyalty to the reliable sound of his earliest work. Because the sound is such an un-mined era in rap history, it is a comforting approach to anyone who fondly remembers the country-fried g-rap of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hml-UVG0v_8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How You Do That""</a>. Leadoff track ""Put Your Stamp on It"", which was actually released in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lEHiPRtUos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube-only format</a> back in 2006, is an easy standout, with its nonchalant swagger. Although ""Make Em Say Ugh"" might give dilettantes the notion that No Limit was all aggressive energy, raw and explosive, Young Bleed was always at his strongest with the kind of strutting restraint on display here.</p>
<p>The variety of production within that framework makes <i>Preserved</i> an especially interesting listen. Lead single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L00oSU-wOZY&amp;hd=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Holla at Uh Dog""</a> is built upon bongos and an exotic flute loop. The way it injects the music video's swamp setting with a particular magic is representative of Bleed's approach as whole: giving the everyday or the cliché a mythical significance. ""It's Nut'n""-- Bleed often writes his track titles out phonetically-- is one of the record's more adventurous beats. Along with stammering horns, the production is all texture, layered money-counting machines and clattering drums giving it the feel of a factory at full-tilt; it is like a ghost of the record's implied setting, the post-industrial landscape of neighborhoods and cities of the economically abandoned. ""Call the Police"", meanwhile, places the album in a specific geography, with its accordion-accompanied zydeco groove, while ""City Uh God"" has an extremely effective live-music feel with its strummed  guitars. Only ""Wall Uh Fame"", which has a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1657-lupe-fiasco/"" target=""_blank"">Lupe Fiasco</a>-esque ""inspirational"" melody, breaks the record's general mood, aiming for emotional transcendence a bit too blatantly.</p>
<p>Of course, it's Young Bleed himself who primarily carries the record by focusing the listener's attention to his lyrics. Fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a> might find something to like here; Bleed's flow has always utilized a similarly slick, imperturbable delivery to buttress more intricately musical rhythms and rhyme schemes. His persona, however, differs considerably from Curren$y's newer incarnation as a jet-setting stoner; Bleed emphasizes the individualism, agency, and nobility of the street soldier, weaving a universal story of hustle and struggle through implied, writer-ly details and a sixth sense for style. <i>Preserved</i> could as easily refer to his stylistic approach as the quality of his output, which remains high 13 years into the game.</p></div>"|15981.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15981-preserved/|7.9|David Drake
