    Proponents of Ween typically offer two arguments in the face of detractors: 1) The band deserves to be taken more seriously because they're ridiculously proficient musicians; or 2) The band shouldn't be taken so seriously, so loosen up and enjoy the ride. In most cases at least one of these defenses is plausible, though neither addresses the main issue that irks so many first-time Ween listeners: How can they so capriciously genre-hop, throw their voices and, worst of all, mar their virtuosity with lyrics about spinal meningitis and scatology? Unfortunately, Ween's newest release, the <em>Friends</em> EP, will certainly perpetuate all these qualms, especially once people realize it's a five-song mini-narrative ending with a ballad about guy-on-guy fellatio.</p><p>
    Fact is, in the post-mash-up era of 2 Many DJs, Girl Talk, et. al., Ween's unpredictable, Janus-faced albums are easier to digest. As long as they're copping a genre people generally enjoy without relying too heavily on f-bombs or fart jokes, they should be fair game. <em>Friends</em>, however, tests these limits more than any Ween release in recent memory. An appetizer for the band's fall 2007 LP-- their first in four years-- this record lacks a single guitar-driven rock song, instead spoofing saccharine dance-pop and exotic tropical genres. Throw in the rainbow-colored packaging and Ween's completely gone from Pink Floyd to pink triangle here, penning the soundtrack to a-- hee-hee-- homoerotic one-night stand that thumbs its nose at the band's recent albums steeped in classic rock.</p><p>
    The eponymous opener sets the tone pretty bluntly, harkening back to dreaded dance-pop phenomena like ""The Macarena"" or ""Numa Numa Dance."" Although standout track ""I Got to Put the Hammer Down"" tries to right the ship with a blistering synth line and prickly drum machine more closely related to CSS than the Venga Boys, the song's two-and-a-half minutes fails to stave off the EP's remaining kitsch. And then there's the Caribbean flotsam ""King Billy"", a reggae-tinged slow-burner that takes six minutes to go nowhere, reeking of something scraped off of Jimmy Buffet's poop deck. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    At a standard level of good humor, one can easily enjoy the closing duo of ""Light Me Up"" and ""Slow Down Boy"", two commonplace but well-executed stabs at genre co-option for Ween. I bet you don't even pick up one on the latter's naughty chorus (""Slow down boy...lay back and let him blow you away"") amidst the catchy faux-Orange Juice balladry. Still, Ween's tongue fares just as well hanging out the mouth as implanted in the cheek, and any release completely bereft of their hardcore and classic rock roots feels like a rip-off. Fortunately none of these tracks will appear on their upcoming full-length, so let's laugh at the novelty of these knuckleheads making a cheesy barbeque soundtrack and hope <em>Friends</em> is only one bizarre pitstop along Ween's continuing quest for hallowed (read: serious) rock and roll buffoonery.</p></div>"|10393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10393-the-friends-ep/|5.2|Adam Moerder

    The Fall has been one of the most loved, talked-about
    post-punk bands throughout its thirty-year run as a forum for Mark E. Smith's
    sarcasm and bile, but the longevity and prolific nature that's helped fuel
    their improbable run is also the very thing that makes them so imposing for new
    listeners. Two dozen studio albums alone is a bewildering assortment, forget
    all the live albums, EPs, singles, compilations, boxed sets, and bootlegs that
    are floating around. It's widely accepted that the highest of the
    band's several peaks occurred in the early-to-mid-80s, when the line-up was
    reasonably stable and the players were at the peaks of their
    respective powers.</p><p>
    I'm not here to challenge that assumption, because I happen
    to agree with it-<em>- This Nation's Saving
    Grace</em>, <em>Perverted By Language</em>, and <em>Hex Enduction Hour</em> are my three favorite
    Fall LPs. Nearly every phase of the band, however, has produced at least some
    interesting material, and they're all worth talking about. The Fall's
    three-album engagement with the Fontana label is one of the least-examined periods in the band's history, partly because the albums themselves have been sporadically
    available, and partly because the period marked a change in the band's music
    that many fans initially recoiled from.</p><p>
    All three albums, 1990's <em>Extricate</em>,
    1991's <em>Shift-Work</em>, and 1992's <em>Code: Selfish</em>, have finally received the
    reissue treatment, complete with obligatory bonus discs-- more on those later--
    and remastering. <em>Extricate</em> was
    actually the first Fall album I heard, on the radio of my old truck during
    high school, when a friend bought it on cassette from a department store cut-out bin as we drove home after seeing local
    bands at an Elks Club lodge. I
    can't even remember what I thought at the time, but it wasn't until college
    that I approached the band on my own, taking the more common route through <em>This Nation's Saving Grace</em> and the <em>458489 A-Sides</em> compilation. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Coming back to this period through the lens of what went
    before and what came after, the music sounds different from archetypical Fall,
    but not so different that a genuine fan wouldn't find a lot to like. These
    albums still feature bassist Steve Hanley and guitarist Craig Scanlon, both
    holdovers from the classic era, and Simon Wolstencroft was
    well-ensconced behind the drums. So it's more a difference in approach and
    attitude that separates these albums from their predecessors. Mark E. Smith was
    coming off his divorce from his wife Brix, whose presence in the band had been
    a major shaping force in the latter half of the 80s. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Extricate</em>, the
    first post-Brix album, is marked by a far more melodic approach than your usual
    Fall joint. It's also loaded up with keyboards, nods to techno, and, in an
    unexpected but welcome twist, Kenny Brady's textural violin playing. ""Sing!
    Harpy"" is as caustic and deadpan as anything in the Fall canon, riding a spare,
    brutal groove as Brady's scraping strings fills in the gaps. It seems as though
    his divorce is fresh on Smith's mind. ""You know I why I hate you, baby?/ Because
    you make me hate you, baby,"" he sing-speaks on ""Black Monk Theme Pt. 1"", one of the
    band's many nods to 60s proto-punks the Monks. This immediately follows the
    sarcastic fake power ballad ""Bill Is Dead"", on which Smith sings, ""this is the
    greatest time of my life,"" over and over while organs swell behind him. It's
    hardly perfect, and ""Bill Is Dead"" wears thin once the novelty wears off, but <em>Extricate</em> is a more integral Fall
    album than it's often given credit for.  
    </p>
<p>
    They seem to be flagging a bit on
    much of <em>Shift-Work</em>, the very title of
    which could be taken to mean that their relentless pace was catching up to them. This is Smith's most prolonged flirtation with traditional singing-- the
    shockingly gentle ""Edinburgh Man"" isn't a prototype for the pop charts, but it draws as much of its staying power from Smith's melodic hook
    as it does from Scanlon's intravenous guitar or Scanlon's bassline. Elsewhere,
    actual backing harmonies populate the title track, and even songs with titles
    like ""The War Against Intelligence"" and ""Book of Lies"" don't have nearly the
    acerbic bite you might expect. Still, most of it works-- the album's principle
    problem is that it runs out of steam toward the end. Closer ""Sinister Waltz"" is
    godawful boring, and ""Rose"" is bleepy, sunny filler that feels out of place
    even on the cheeriest Fall album.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Code: Selfish</em>
    features a lean line-up of Hanley, Scanlon, Smith and Wolstencroft, with some
    keyboard work from David Bush. It's nearly as good as <em>Extricate</em>, bringing the band's nasty edge back full force without
    returning outright to familiar territory. And unlike <em>Shift-Work</em>, <em>C:S</em> doesn't
    leave you wondering what you're in for after the first track-- ""The Birmingham
    School of Business School"" leads things right off with a crackling beat and a
    jumble of church bell samples, with a double-tracked MES slurring out a sour
    serenade over the top and wrestling with Scanlon's squirming leads. Hanley
    essentially plays a would-be sequencer part manually on his bass. Hanley and
    Scanlon interact with startling precision throughout, but their finest moment
    is ""Two Face!"" which pits Scanlon's clean-toned note clusters and ringing
    chords against a see-sawing Hanley grind.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Everything Hurtz"" has a cut-glass groove, with Wolstencroft
    masterfully controlling the song's momentum by switching up his beat. The
    single version is on the bonus disc. As one might imagine, the three bonus
    discs of these reissues present a widely varied and inconsistent mixture of
    b-sides, castaways, BBC recordings,
    and alternate versions. With nearly an hour of extras per album, the band's
    hardest-core obsessives-- most of their audience, come to think of it-- will have
    plenty to dig into. The BBC
    sessions (four tracks on each disc) are among the most valuable additions, but
    there are other gems, including the immortal ""British People in Hot Weather"",
    with its huge, sarcastic Caribbean keyboard hook and nasty funk groove, and ""High
    Tension Line"", which takes its title to heart in a its taut, wiry arrangement.
    </p>
<p>
    All told, this phase of the Fall's long and strange career is
    definitely worth exploring once you've become hooked on them, but it isn't a place
    to start. If you've been waiting for quality reissues of the albums, these
    versions give you a lot for your legal tender, scraping mostly gold from the
    seemingly endless pit of rare Fall material.

    No artist gets to decide how they'll be remembered. If, as seems increasingly likely, Nick Lowe ends up remembered as the guy who penned ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding"" back in the early 1970s, surely the songwriter will be satisfied.</p><p>
    Yet fans and followers of Lowe know there's a nearly endless stream of legitimate second (or first) choices for pick of his defining moment. As a member of Brinsley Schwarz, Lowe helped bridge pub rock to punk. Lowe inaugurated the Stiff label with his single ""So It Goes"", and more explicitly helped pave the way for punk's indie movement by producing the Damned's epochal ""New Rose"". He subsequently produced key tracks for the Pretenders and several albums for Elvis Costello.</p><p>
    But maybe most impressive of all Lowe's feats was ""The Beast in Me"", a song from his 1994 comeback album <em>The Impossible Bird</em>, long after he had faded from pop prominence. Later that same year, the song also became the best non-stunt cover of one-time father-in-law Johnny Cash's late-career comeback. It was a cred-boosting number all around, and proved once and for all Lowe's worth as a songwriter in the classic sense rather than just a snide wit with an ear for hooks. His nickname ""Basher"" stemmed from his ability/compulsion to just crank out songs, but <em>The Impossible Bird</em> and songs like ""The Beast in Me"" showed a more considered, thoughtful, patient side to Lowe.
    </p>
<p>
    Fittingly and full circle, in many ways Lowe owes this mellow change of direction to ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding"". Curtis Stigers covered the song on the soundtrack to ""The Bodyguard"", and in Lowe's own words it was like someone suddenly dumped a bag of money on his doorstep. Free from commercial considerations, Lowe started exploring his love of classic country, soul, r&amp;b and crooner jazz, a path that continues with the new <em>At My Age</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    There's been some talk of this most recent stage of Lowe's career as being too sentimental, or sans balls. But while Lowe's hardly up to his old tricks, his new tricks have more than their share of pleasures. If Lowe used to attack pop songs with a punk's cynicism and an ironic streak a mile wide, these days he exudes the illusion that he's settled down and settled in when in fact he's been happily exploring formalism with a sly wink. By his account, he started taking his guitar out to the country and playing old dancehalls, letting the new material breath and live a little until it resembled the pre- and early-rock era he aimed to emulate.
    </p>
<p>
    In fact, both Lowe and his press materials have made a big deal about distinguishing the covers from the originals contained on <em>At My Age</em>, and Lowe's last few records have made a similar game of spotting the genuine classic amidst the songs that simply sound like genuine classics. It's a cleverly subversive strategy in its own right, the grey-haired and grown-up ex-punk making music his dad would have liked, though experience has added an air of increased authenticity to songs such as ""A Better Man"" and the almost imperceptibly skanking ""Long Limbed Girl"".
    </p>
<p>
    Indeed, now Lowe is 58, both his parents have passed, and he's an unlikely first time dad, so it's somewhat hard to imagine him twisting the earnest sentiments of Charlie Feathers' ""A Man in Love"" to suit his former sarcastic mode. Of course, Lowe can still be funny, too, as he is on ""The Club"", which begins ""If you've ever had someone come along/ Reach in, pull out your heart and break it/ Just for fun/ As easy as humming a song/ Join the club."" On ""People Change"" (which features Chrissie Hynde and some nice Stax horns), he basically dismisses the call of nostalgia with a blithe but affable declaration of ""People change/ That's the long and short of it.""
    </p>
<p>
    ""Now, you say those times you had were never that many/ Just be thankful you had any/ And cut yourself a slice of reality,"" Lowe gently advises, and he seems to have taken his own advice and moved on.
    </p>
<p>
    At his age, Lowe's still young enough to get away with making music in his former mode, but he's old enough to know better. Instead of looking to the recent past for inspiration, he's looked to the even more distant past, if only because it's the music that-- square or not-- currently makes him the most happy and content. And for 33 minutes or so, if you follow Lowe's lead and let loose any baggage you might be carrying, you're likely to be as happy as he is, too.<br/>

    The word ""psychedelic"" is often used to describe the music of Jennifer Gentle, an inevitability when you take your name from a Syd Barrett lyric. But in the case of this Italian outfit, the word is really just being used as another term for ""weird."" The defining qualities of psychedelia-- out-of-body transcendence, hallucinations, altered states of perception-- don't really factor into the experience of listening to <em>The Midnight Room</em>, Jennifer Gentle's second Sub Pop release. The album's backstory certainly proposes a supernatural subtext: after parting ways with long-time collaborator Alessio Gastaldello, founding member Marco Fasolo sequestered himself in a home studio where, according to legend (or record company bio), a prior owner had killed himself. The result is a hermetic, claustrophobic recording that, rather than distort the reality of your surroundings, makes you hyper-aware of them-- not unlike a sleepless night where every creak and squeak in the dark seems to pierce your ears and heighten the sense of panic.</p><p>
    Given the grim history of Fasolo's recording space, it's appropriate that <em>The Midnight Room</em> opens with a song called ""Twin Ghosts"", making allusions to <em>The Shining</em> all the more explicit. Immediately, the song distances the new album from its 2005 predecessor, <em>Valende</em>, its hyperactive racket displaced by a disquieting sense of calm: over a wheezing church-organ drone, Fasolo sighs out a ghostly, indecipherable choral melody, while periodic guitar plucks and floor-tom beats delineate the existence of a chorus. This hazy stasis is echoed on the album's closing track, ""Come Closer"", essentially, a slow-motion revision of Pink Floyd's ""Astronomy Domine."" But these tracks prove to be anomalies-- the dusk/dawn bookends to a very bizarre night that transpires in between.</p><p>
    Fasolo plays every instrument heard on <em>The Midnight Room</em>, and in the album's middle eight-song string, he sounds like he's trying to record all his parts at once: guitar chords are played on single strings in circular patterns, each string pluck punctuated by a broken tin-soldier drum beat. The songs all share a curious, clockwork nature that effectively enhances the strangeness of Fasolo's voice, which often makes you wonder if the singer is seven years old or 70. But if Fasolo's intent on <em>The Midnight Room</em> was to evoke the feeling of a mind slowly deteriorating, he's done almost too good a job-- over the course of the album, the spare notes and martial rhythms accrue the maddening effect of a water-torture drip. This fidgety restlessness seems set to explode on ""It's In Her Eyes"", when a hard snare hit triggers a loud, power-chord riff and a scream; alas, it's the final note of the song.
    </p>
<p>
    The blissed-out space-boy heard on <em>Valende</em> hasn't been completely lost in the void: Winsome turns like ""Take My Hand"" and ""Electric Princess"" suggest that Fasolo's fascination with Syd Barrett has little to do with the latter's acid-casualty legend and more to do with his plainspoken charms and innocent, romantic whimsy. But another pervasive influence appears to be Frank Zappa's <em>Freak Out!</em>, in the kazoo flourishes of ""Mercury Blood"" and the pervasive things-going-bump-in-the-night clatter, which hits a fever pitch in the cacophonous din of pounding pianos and typewriter bells that comprise ""Granny's House"". <em>The Midnight Room</em> is a masterful exercise in creating a peculiar and absorbing sense of mood and place. But, as befits an album born of extreme isolation, its painstaking, constricting song structures can also make <em>The Midnight Room</em> an unwelcoming place to be.

In a     sense this makes the guitar one of the earliest synthesizers, so maybe it's not     shocking that a lot of that time and effort has been spent, with the aid of     fretboard know-how and fancy pedals and effects, making guitars sound like     actual synthesizers.</p>
<p>You could hear it in the hum of Robert Fripp's experiments     with Brian Eno, or Robin Guthrie's wall of sound with the Cocteau Twins. After acid house,     countless UK artists like Slowdive and Seefeel did it. To an extent, Sigur Rós does     it. You can even hear it in Christian Fennesz's soundscapes, where his guitar     playing is chopped up like any other ingredient in his glitchy pastoral techno,     and you can certainly hear it with Ulrich Schnauss, whose dreamscapes owe at     least as much to his guitar as they do to his mushy new age melodies and mild     beats.</p>
<p><i>Goodbye</i>, Schnauss' third record, follows two discs that wanted terribly much to be breakthroughs,     2001's <i>Far Away Trains Passing By</i> and 2003's <i>A Strangely Isolated Place</i>--     each a perfectly pleasant album that ultimately felt a few years     too late. The superior <i>A Strangely Isolated Place</i> did incorporate amorphous vocals the same way it incorporated ethereal guitar, but     it still sounded more than a little bit like background music, and not     necessarily in a good way, all but demanding video accompaniment of white     horses running in slow motion or time-lapse footage of flowers blooming.</p>
<p>If <i>A Strangely Isolated Place</i> lacked a little of the     darkness and mystery ambient music needs to grab a hold of you, you still could     admittedly sense some stylistic storm clouds lingering at the edges of the     compositions that hinted at better stuff to come. The good news is that <i>Goodbye</i> shows Schnauss now has an even a better grasp of structure and     songwriting. Tracks like the trite but lovely ""Shine"", ""Stars"", the awesomely     Curve-y ""Medusa"" and ""Here Today, Gone Tomorrow"" feel like more than just     open-ended vamps, and, importantly, some tougher guitar adds to their impact. Some vocals are handled by Rob McVey from Longview and Judith Beck, but they're mostly mixed in like so     many additional effects.</p>
<p>The bad news is that the overwhelming vibe is still that of     easy listening digital mush, with songs such as ""A Song About Hope"" and ""Never Be     the Same"" are pretty Cocteau Twins retreads that show how     something once radical can become utterly banal in the wrong hands-- or the     wrong decade. A few moments, like ""Einfeld"" and ""In Between the     Years"", veer into the realm of aural wallpaper, like Cluster on an     uninspired day, the shimmering guitars/synths a little too preset pacific in     their swells and swooshes. In this context the coarsely strummed acoustic that starts     the final track ""For Good"" is downright obnoxious, the big reveal that     surprises no one beyond its self-satisfied orchestrator. It's this self-consciousness that keeps     Ulrich, album after album, from fully succeeding.</p>
<p>As a maker of ambient music, Schnauss needs to pick a     position. Does he want to lose himself in the music, to totally disappear,     leaving behind nothing but a diffuse cloud of sound where a man and his     terrestrial equipment once stood? Or does he want to keep exploring this     pedestrian man-with-guitar-doing-weird-things field, where the musical impact     is more academic than it is particularly cool or compelling?<span> </span>This lack of commitment is what makes     Schnauss and <i>Goodbye</i> so frustrating. It's as if he's seen the light but,     rather than share what he knows of the cosmos, chooses instead to offer a     tantalizing but incomplete approximation of it.</p></div>"|10406.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10406-goodbye/|5.4|Joshua Klein

    Prior to the release of <em>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</em>, online buzz suggested Spoon's
    sixth record was a grower, a distinction also conferred upon the Austin
    band's two previous albums, each more experimental (and at times
    alienating) than its predecessor. That optimistic adjective-- which
    incorporates both the listener's failure to quickly grasp a record as well
    as a hope to eventually do so-- feels exceedingly appropriate for Spoon,
    who have cultivated an intense fan base while continuing to experiment
    (the frequent comparisons to Wilco are indeed apt in this case).</p><p>
    A large contingent of Spoon's following has come from Britt Daniel's
    continual knack for, as he sang on 1998's ""Metal Detektor"", making ""the
    sound of getting kicked when you're down."" If any song were to be the quintessential Spoon pop single, then, the radiant, Jon Brion-produced ""The Underdog"", a Cliff's Notes encapsulation of Spoon's earnest compassion for the fucked-over, is it. With a three-piece brass fanfare, ""Underdog"" is a battle cry against succumbing to mediocrity masquerading as a middle finger to the standard-bearers: The lyric ""Get free from the middle man"" could also read: ""Get free from the middle, man."" Likewise, the slinky ""Don't You Evah"" (a cover of an unreleased song by former tourmates the Natural History) affirms Spoon's trend toward emotional trusses for the fairer sex, recalling <em>Gimme Fiction</em>'s ""They Never Got You"" and <em>Kill the Moonlight</em>'s ""Don't Let It Get You Down"". A different directive occurs on opener ""Don't Make Me a Target"", however, which revisits the obscurantist personal politicizing that many thought marked <em>Fiction'</em>s ""My Mathematical Mind"". With a few well-chosen phrases-- ""Here come a man from the star...Beating his drum...Nuclear dicks with their dialect drawls,"" both victim and perpetrator become crystal clear.</p><p>
<em>Ga Ga</em> travels past in a flash-- at 36 minutes, it returns to the brief runtime that <em>Fiction</em> well surpassed-- but leaves plenty of reasons to revisit. Daniel and drummer Jim Eno's tendencies toward studio-based devilry come full-flower here, each listen revealing craftsmen reveling in detail. What in lesser hands could be extra-textual gobbledygook instead feels the product of studio freestyling, something to which the murky mixing-board wizardry of Jamaican dub is an obvious precursor. Penultimate song ""Finer Feelings"" is one bit of proof, its wide-open guitars-- straight from <em>Sandinista!</em>-- augmented with a sampled toast from (Clash collaborator) Mikey Dread's ""Industrial Spy"". With the addition of echoed ambiance from a Brussels fair field recording, ""Feelings"" acquires the aura of a surreal Kingston sound system. </p><p>
    Earlier, ""Evah""'s introduction dips into the self-referentiality the band
    flirted with on <em>Fiction</em>, featuring a diced-up, looped Daniel asking Eno to
    record his studio talkback. Two songs later, all manner of discordance
    enters and exits the reverb-heavy mix of the appropriately titled ""Eddie's
    Ragga"", which developed from a jam session with Eddie Robert of
    Daniel-produced Austinites I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness. <em>Ga Ga</em>'s most intriguing sonic creation, however, is the song which takes the dub influence in the furthest direction: ""The Ghost of You Lingers"". A return to <em>Moonlight</em>'s spooky sonic variegation, ""Ghost""'s pounding, echoed piano feels like a merged memory of the jabbed guitar from ""Small Stakes"" with ""Paper Tiger""'s moody expressionism. Daniel's unmistakable voice is a distant, gothic wail here, as he mourns his missing love with characteristic jargon: ""We put on a clinic/ If you were here would you calm me down or settle the score.""</p><p>
    Daniel's gift for non-mawkish romanticism results in both <em>Ga Ga</em>'s best
    moments, and three of the best songs the band has yet create. Especially on <em>Girls Can Tell</em>, Spoon's always flirted with straight-up blue-eyed soul, and ""You Got Yr Cherry Bomb"" is their full-on take-off of Elvis Costello's Motown M.O. on <em>Get Happy</em>! (perhaps purposefully, then, the album's bonus disc is titled <em>Get Nice!</em>). Backed by an irresistible Holland-Dozier-Holland gospel-pop-stomp, ""Cherry Bomb"" re-imagines the heart/sleeve cliché as a vivid bicep tattoo, as Daniel implores his love to three-point-turn and chill out. <em>Ga Ga</em>'s real bang happens at its close, however, with the one-two send-off of ""Feelings"" and ""Black Like Me"". The former, which ostensibly documents a Memphis-based isolation, features a handclap-accompanied chorus as energized and unremittingly hopeful as Daniel's ever been: ""Sometimes I think that I'll find a love/ One that's gonna change my heart/ I'll find it in <em>Commercial Appeal</em>/ And then this heartache'll get chased away."" </p><p>
    ""Black""'s melodic melancholy-- backed by a weeping piano/guitar motif that
    recalls <em>Let it Bleed</em>-- is simply gorgeous. Has Daniel ever written a lyric
    more crushing in its confused simplicity than ""I'm in need of someone to
    take care of me tonight""? Rather than attempt to relate with someone who's already taken leave, he splits, and so, apparently, does his mind. During the internalized call-and-response that follows, he appeals: ""All the weird kids up front/ Tell me what you know you want."" Thus, at the end of his emotional rope, he crosses the fourth wall and reveals the aching coda as a mutually lived performance.
    </p>
<p>
    With <em>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</em>, Spoon have once again found a gray area between the poles of pop accessibility and untested studio theorizing, modifying a formula that has grown to feel familiar even as it wanders, and refusing to square the circle while doing so. Through whatever process they use, the band has also managed to create yet another wonderfully singular indie rock record, unafraid of unfettered passion or self-sabotage, and which affirms a shrouded, hybrid style as unquestionably theirs. Perhaps it is fitting to refer to <em>Ga Ga</em>, and Spoon albums on the whole, as growers, then, but with a different definition: one that takes into account the bands continual, and continually rewarding, approach to creative maturation. <br/>

    Any fiction teacher worth his or her salt will tell you that details-- precisely chosen, concisely described-- are crucial for making stories and characters believable. At least from his very first songs with the Drive-By Truckers, Jason Isbell has proved he's innately aware of this maxim: ""Outfit"", ""Decoration Day"", and ""Danko/Manuel"" are crammed with telling observations, concrete imagery, and lots of proper nouns. Likewise, his debut solo album, <em>Sirens of the Ditch</em>, works so well because it sounds so specific, whether he's ostensibly singing about his own predicaments or about his characters'.</p><p>
    On ""Grown"", he admits to ""dancing to 'Purple Rain'"" as a kid; on ""Try"", he advises himself to ""take a year off and go back home,"" as if he's already worked out a plan in his head. With its observations about ""bombs in the sand"" and ""scripture on grocery store signs,"" ""Dress Blues"" is the most complicated consideration of military heroism since the Dixie Chicks' ""Travelin' Soldier"". Best of all is the swamp-rock saga ""Down in a Hole"", which comes up one corncob shy of Faulknerian. In the first verse, Isbell describes a man ""standing in the window with his tongue hanging out/ With a dirty white suit, a big white hat, and a bullet in his pocket."" The man's wealth and ambition have corroded a small Southern town, but rather than preach outright, Isbell couches it in a character's advice to another not to work for this man. ""It's like selling your soul,"" he warns.</p><p>
    Isbell himself is obviously an ambitious songwriter and storyteller, and perhaps that trait led to his exit from the Drive-By Truckers earlier this year. Who but the band really know? When Isbell came aboard for the <em>Southern Rock Opera</em> tour in 2002, filling out the band's Skynyrdesque three-guitar attack, his work fit perfectly alongside that of Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley, both of whom specialize in story-songs drenched in local color and rich with regional detail. In 2004 and 2005, when the Truckers released <em>Decoration Day</em> and <em>The Dirty South</em>, it seemed unfair that one band should horde three top-notch songwriters, but in 2006, the lackluster <em>A Blessing and a Curse</em> showed the cracks in the unit.
    </p>
<p>
    Like that album, <em>Sirens</em> occasionally sounds too slick, as on ""Chicago Promenade"" and ""Brand New Kind of Actress"", like he's trying to sell us something. With several Truckers in tow-- including Patterson Hood (who co-produces), bass player Shonna Tucker, and drummer Brad Morgan-- Isbell shows off his mastery of heavy Southern rock riffage on ""Try"" (which could be an epilogue to ""Danko/Manuel""), but the mostly acoustic second half works hard to distance him from the Truckers' dense electric sound and to expand his lyrical and vocal range. ""Hurricanes and Hand Grenades""-- five minutes of Muscle Shoals soul-- is the most obvious departure and features Isbell's most effortless and powerful performance. ""The Magician"" strums along at a front-porch clip that underscores the ache of the lyrics (""I had a bride/ I sawed her in half"" is both sad and funny), and the tense guitars of ""Shotgun Wedding"" bolster its shoddy stalker story, but closer ""The Devil Is My Running Mate"" is dark and too heavy-handed, suggesting that political commentary isn't Isbell's forte. It's a weak ending for a strong debut full of the kind of confident, charismatic songwriting that just can't be taught.<br/>

    Arthur &amp; Yu's
    debut LP, <em>In Camera</em> (the inaugural release for Sub Pop's
    new imprint, Hardly Art) is cute, coy, and a little bit gooey. With
    twinkling flutes, wide-eyed boy-girl harmonies, and 60s folk-pop
    melodies, <em>In Camera</em> would be infuriatingly precious if it
    weren't also weird, druggy, and mesmerizing. Fronted by Grant
    Olsen and Sonya Westcott (""Arthur"" and ""Yu""
    are their respective childhood nicknames), the Seattle-based duo have
    doused their songs with a bucket of reverb, and <em>In Camera</em>'s
    throbbing guitars, muted vocals, and mawkish arrangements sound more
    like the Velvet Underground and Nico (or Karen Dalton, or Serge
    Gainsbourg) than anything you'd ever dig up on Twee.net.</p><p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Vocal duties are split
    between Olsen and Westcott (who, incidentally, was Rogue Wave's
    original bassist), and their voices are nicely complimentary, weaving
    together almost flawlessly-- Westcott's pipes are more
    fixed, whereas Olsen's voice seems to constantly flit from coo
    to caterwaul. Still, the juxtaposition of control and chaos works
    well (critics everywhere have pointed to the pair's undeniable
    Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra dynamic); on ""Come to View
    (Song for Neil Young)"", especially, the vocals crest and wane
    over jangly guitar and honking melodica, lending a curious layer of
    psychedlia to an otherwise staid pop song. Bobby Wane, Ben Kersten,
    and Scott Blue help fill out the group's sound, but <em>In
    Camera</em>'s instrumentation-- while rich and beguiling--
    ultimately feels secondary to all that singing.</p><p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Olsen and Westcott have
    publicly copped to the little-kid themes on <em>In Camera</em>, from
    their adopted monikers to the schoolyard/pellet gun musings of ""Half Years"", and much of the record has the grainy, nostalgic feel of
    an old, Super 8 home movie: conjure unsteady montages of toddlers
    with smeared faces diving onto swingsets, waddling in circles through
    backyard gardens, pawing at bugs, tugging at their diapers, giggling
    and eating dirt and hurling their arms around other people's
    bare legs. The record does offer up its share of darker moments: the
    smarmy ""Lion's Mouth"" explores burgeoning sexuality
    via vaguely creepy, nuance-heavy lyrics (""Oh, we coulda kept it
    fun...My fingers in your buttons,"" Olsen mews). 
    </p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Like the Raveonettes, Jesus and Mary Chain, the Clientele, or My Morning Jacket, how much you dig Arthur &amp;
    Yu is probably directly proportional to how much reverb you can
    stomach without wanting to clean out your ears with cotton swabs--
    but if you don't mind a good dosing of echo, <em>In Camera</em>
    is an impressive debut for both band and label.

    Why are you leaving the house? A concert? Stay home. Stream it. Why travel? You can always make trans-Atlantic friends with MySpace. Fodor's has some pretty brilliant photographs, too. And what's the deal with getting sweaty this summer? The air conditioner is so nice.</p><p>
    Krist Krueger-- the 26-year-old Wisconsin-born, Portland-based songwriter that leads what was once a one-man-band called Southerly-- is terrified of living a safe life. He wants experience. ""So coax yourself to make believe/ That you'll come back in a cloud of smoke/ With guns blazing,"" he boasts on ""How to Be a Dreamer"", the literal and thematic centerpiece of his second album, <em>Storyteller &amp; the Gossip Columnist</em>. ""And on that day, you'll find yourself/ The self that you've been struggling to be/ Just make believe."" Elsewhere, Krueger-- who leads a band, owns a record label, runs a booking agency, produces records and ostensibly has a personal life-- depicts the pretty, jaded girl snubbing romantic inquiries, ponders the empty pages lining the narrative of his life, and laments kids wasting their romantic youths while sitting in factory parking lots. If Krueger were a character in a Built to Spill song, he wouldn't be stuck at home in Twin Falls.</p><p>
    That ideal of living the rich, full life cuts both ways on <em>Columnist</em>: There's a wonderful amount of variety here, from the crescendo that capitalizes on the potential energy of Krueger's coiled emotions during the self-doubting ""If We All Forgot"" to the pedestrian showmanship springing from the piano keys during the hopeful ""Soldiers"". Krueger is arranging for a full band with horns and strings on <em>Columnist</em>, and, thrown to the orchestra for the first time, he's remarkably accomplished, tastefully piling layers that augment rather than clutter. And the songs themselves come with bent, purposefully altered structures: One leads with the refrain, while another condenses its verses to a sum of 30 seconds and lets the edict-- ""Breathe, 'cause it just might be your last""-- and melodramatic violin movements occupy most of the other two minutes. Krueger also sings with the fidelity of a songwriter who's seen what he's saying. In fact, he's often better at conveying his sentiments with vocal nuances than with the words themselves: Lyrically, the cresting ""If We All Forget"" is a wash (""I'm afraid, scared to death...I'm a shell of who I once was""), but Krueger's voice-- a thin wisp of air barely passing through his high register-- articulates the anxiety perfectly.
    </p>
<p>
    But when Krueger misses either lyrically or musically, his problems stem from rushed concepts, as though he's trying to say or live too much too fast. The most interesting lyrical ideas here are tossed-off. Krueger raises interesting lyrical ideas, such as his suggestion that John Lennon's love songs were about more than love, and that some hearts can actually be scared of future calluses. But he never really chases these ideas with the vigor and vision they warrant. The latter even gets treated like a Jason Mraz jangle, ""old man's eyes"" rhymed with paralyzed over a chafing acoustic guitar jerk and a lazy bass throb. 
    </p>
<p>
    Likewise, the handful of musical ideas that don't meet their potential on <em>Columnist</em> suffer from a lack of commitment: Only one of the four instrumentals here (the ponderous waltz of ""For the Speechless Coward"", foreshadowing ""Dreamer"", the album's pinnacle) has any sway on the imprint the album provides when its 38 minutes are up. Prelude ""Visage Sans Expression"" surrounds a fleet, fingerpicked acoustic line with strings both dark and bright. It's pretty and graceful but, ultimately, just passive. Likewise, 52-second closer ""Simple Simon"" tinkers with two concurrent guitar loops. It's an interesting trinket, but its ultimate effect is showing: All the sudden, you'll probably realize you've enjoyed your time with <em>Storyteller &amp; the Gossip Columnist</em> well enough, but you don't feel too much about the music that's been soundtracking your last 38 minutes. That's more than a tad ironic, right?<br/>

The product of a bygone New
    York City filled with dank alleys and
    smoke-choked dives, Interpol fed on their own mystery while translating cool
    kid record collections into sexy downtown paranoia. They received a few
    positive notices, too. In the glowing Pitchfork review of the LP, Eric Carr
    wrote, ""Although it's no <em>Closer</em> or <em>OK Computer</em>, it's not unthinkable that
    this band might aspire to such heights."" And now-- after the tight,
    familiar turns of 2004's <em>Antics</em> and a major label deal-- their lofty aspirations
    are finally kicking in.</p><p>
    Horns, extended outros, strings, an oboe, and album art featuring
    more than three colors-- welcome to the new
    world of Interpol. <em>Our Love to Admire</em> is the sound of a minted Madison
    Square Garden
    band seeking to freshen its damp
    atmospherics. It's not a terrible idea: On <em>Antics</em>, even Interpol seemed tired
    of Interpol, capping the disc's 10 tracks with a couple drawn-out duds. But,
    as anyone who's bought laundry detergent knows, ""new and improved""
    does not always mean ""new"" or ""improved."" <em>Admire</em>'s
    predictable adornments quickly prove fleeting and expose Interpol's nagging limitations
    rather than their potential.</p><p>
    With cleaner production and an arsenal of instruments at
    their disposal, the group indulges, and the songs often suffer. Tracks like
    six-minute opener ""Pioneer to the Falls"" and the limp lowlight
    ""Scale"" grate due to overly repetitive song structures
    that rely too heavily on choppy breakdowns and pointless solos. And the band's
    previously economical songwriting, built on quick, bursting hooks and seamless
    transitions, is now grand, stately, and bloated-- more like a depressing U2 than a
    poppy Joy Division.
    </p><p>
    While it would be easy (and probably accurate) to blame
    <em>Admire</em>'s flaws on the group's heightened commercial ambitions, that's only part
    of the problem. With their first two LPs, Interpol vaulted over like-minded contemporaries thanks to their superior interplay between rhythm and
    melody. Instead of letting Banks and guitarist Daniel Kessler dominate songs
    with their trebly timbres, bassist Carlos D. and drummer Sam Fogarino
    provided perfect complements, at times overshadowing their bandmates altogether. (Just
    listen to the loping low-end of ""Untitled"" or the stutter-step snares
    on ""Evil"" for proof.) But <em>Admire</em> finds the band's balance shifting
    significantly; the rhythm players often seem more like glorified session men
    than integral components of a sleek post-punk machine. Gone are the death-disco
    grooves that made ""Slow Hands"" and ""Obstacle 1"" strangely
    danceable, and without
    those dynamic rhythmic counterpoints, the tempos slacken, songs drag, and the focus
    inevitably turns to Banks' increasingly frustrating word splatters. 
    </p>
<p>
    Banks has always been a between-the-lines lyricist-- his
    default is somewhere between opaque and lazy free association. With each new
    song, though, it becomes less
    certain that there was ever anything worth searching for between the lines in
    the first place. On <em>Admire</em>, he's
    slightly more overt, but this time his gripes with the opposite sex sometimes
    take on a surreal 80s rock star quality. ""No I in Threesome"",
    ostensibly about convincing a girlfriend to invite her friend into bed, is
    either a hilarious parody of an embarrassingly self-serious Paul Banks song-- or just
    an embarrassingly self-serious ménage a blah. (It's not both.) ""The Heinrich Maneuver""
    rails against a cold-hearted, phony, manipulative actress (shocking!) and
    ""Rest My Chemistry"" has the singer grappling with an eternal query:
    Can you ever be too worn out on drugs to have sex with a young groupie? (A
    young groupie subject to head-smacking lines like, ""You look so young like a
    daisy in my lazy eye,"" no less.) More than ever, Banks tries to add some
    sympathy to his reedy robot croon and nearly succeeds on the wistful
    ""Wrecking Ball"". Still, when he monotones, ""I've got this soul,
    it's all fired up,"" he sounds as thrilled as a sleepy Stephen Hawking. 
    </p>
    On ""Threesome"", Banks suggests, ""It's
    time we give something new a try."" And his quest for a guilt-free three-way is as doomed as Interpol's dalliances with heavy-handed, big-budget
    gestures on <em>Admire</em>. Can they make an <em>OK Computer</em> or <em>Closer</em>? At this point,
    another <em>Antics</em> would suffice.</div>"|10413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10413-our-love-to-admire/|6.0|Ryan Dombal

    For a guy whose individual records can be so willfully
    fragmented, Frank Black's solo career has run in
    a straight line. In the beginning, he sounded like someone who'd just broken up Pixies, and his first two solo albums-- <em>Teenager
    of the Year</em>, in particular-- are nearly on par with his work in the band. Then, Black settled into a sort of quirky classic rock
    phase with the Catholics, and has now spent the last several years in reflection,
    revisiting the Pixies with a reunion of the band itself and with his own solo
    re-examination of songs he made with the band on the two-disc set <em>Frank Black Francis</em>.</p><p>
    These past few years, which also saw Black trying his hand at
    the singer-songwriter game in Memphis,
    aren't accounted for on <em>93-03</em>, which covers the first nine albums
    of his solo career (plus a bonus live disc recorded last year that touches on some recent material). While the Pixies have been anthologized nearly to death, there's never been a solo Black survey before this, and it seems like a
    good time to take a peek back at the years between his times with the Pixies,
    because the straight line he's drawn so far feels like it has to branch off in a
    new direction from here.</p><p>
    The 22 studio tracks gathered on <em>93-03</em> (there's one new one from
    his forthcoming <em>Bluefinger</em> album,
    too) are arranged in simple chronological fashion, which makes his gradual
    migration from out-on-a-limb to the roots of the rock family tree seem
    improbably smooth. But it also underscores how much more interesting his youthful ADHD delivery was when compared to his present-day trad-rock performances: Where <em>Teenager of the Year</em> was wildly unpredictable, showcasing Black skipping from one far-out genre to the next, <em>Dog in the Sand</em> and <em>Black Letter Days</em> crawled with familiar rock tropes and felt oddly
    wooden. It's no accident that <em>Teenager</em>
    is represented  here by five tracks while the following four albums are covered in just six.  
    </p>
<p>
    Track selection could've gone about a dozen different ways,
    since Black has no real hits apart from ""Los Angeles"" and the blissfully anthemic ""Headache"". The songs off his stranger early albums play mostly to the middle, focusing on oddball rock tunes like
    ""Ten Percenter"", ""(I Want to Live on an) Abstract Plain"", and the immortal
    ""Freedom Rock"". However, opener ""Los Angeles"" is about as out-there as this compilation gets musically,
    with its faux-metal riffage and doom-stricken keyboard bridge.
    </p>
<p>
    There are a lot of solid tracks strewn through the disc after
    ""Freedom Song"" wraps up the early phase. ""You Ain't Me"" and ""Men in Black"", from
    1996's disappointing <em>Cult of Ray</em>, are
    stronger than I remember (""Men in Black"", for what it's worth, was originally a <em>Teenager</em> B-side), but the Catholics years are mixed to say the least. ""All My
    Ghosts"", from 1998's <em>Frank Black &amp;
    the Catholics</em>, and <em>Pistolero</em>'s
    ""Bad Harmony"" both possess the manic energy that serves Black best, and the latter
    in particular is a great example of Black thriving in a pretty traditional rock
    setting. <em>Dog in the Sand</em>'s
    ""Hermaphroditos"", though it sometimes feels like Frank Black trying to live up
    to being old weird Black Francis, is nevertheless greatly entertaining, with its
    squeezed-out chorus and freaked-out verses. Still, some songs are leaden: ""I
    Gotta Move"" has an awkward call-and-response chorus; ""Velvety"", from 2002's <em>Devil's Workshop</em>, is as close to
    outright bland as Black gets; and ""Manitoba"" is a ballad with horns and slide
    guitar that points the way toward <em>Fast Man Raider Man</em>, with a melody that isn't
    especially suited to Black's voice.
    </p>
<p>
    The new song, ""Threshold Apprehension"", sounds like it may
    have been inspired by the Pixies reunion-- it's punkier and spazzier than
    anything he's done in years, coming off almost like a reaction to his mellow Memphis sessions. Black
    bleats and squawks  his way through it
    like he might have in 1989, but the sonic character of its dry, straightforward production is closer to what
    we've grown used to in his work with the Catholics. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>93-03</em> does serve as a nice overview of Black's first eleven years
    as a musical bachelor, and anyone listening for the first time should be able
    to get a strong sense of whether the album each track is drawn from might be worth pursuing further. Still, <em>Teenager of the Year</em> remains the first stop on any tour of Frank Black's solo career, especially for those seeking something closer to his original Pixies flair.

    ""Quiet,"" ""delicate,"" and ""low-key"" neatly summed up the For Carnation when they released two EPs (or one EP and one very brief album) after the breakup of singer/guitarist Brian McMahan's former band, Slint. But these words failed to catch the band's atmospheric <em>raison d'être</em>, and led the excellent self-titled album that would follow to be positively slept-on. Legacy's a bitch that way. <em>Promised Works</em> combines the two out-of-print EPs, <em>Fight Songs</em> and <em>Marshmallows</em>, released between the disbandment of Slint and the For Carnation's self-titled (and final) album. This re-release offers the band a chance to get out from under Slint's long shadow, but more than that, it undercuts the obstinate, near-religious seriousness with which McMahan's other projects are received, which is just maybe what casual fans mean when they reach to call Slint ""overrated."" Slint deserved the praise; the For Carnation could use a little more.</p><p>
    The unaccompanied strum of ""Grace Beneath the Pines"" isn't much more than a whisper, sure, but it wields silence in the same rapier way as Slint. It also shows off McMahan's preternatural sense of timing, as he moves like an off-Broadway prodigy, with every chord change just a hair behind the beat. These EP's also rescued McMahan's voice from where it had been buried since <em>Tweez</em> and put it front and center, which was a brave choice, a refreshing change of pace, and maybe not actually the best idea: his callow creak on blunt noir-bent lines about ""crackheads and assassins and burn victims and millionaires sons"" undersells them. ""How I Beat the Devil"", however, quickly dodges expectation with an aimless little riff that bursts into a sunny, straightforward groove lasting just over a minute.</p><p>
<em>Fight Songs</em> ended on the hopeful but still meandering ""Get and Stay Get March"", and were all indeed pretty tentative when compared to <em>Marshmallows</em>, which would follow a year later. This is the record where the stone-seriousness garnered by the cult of Slint was deflated by a much more relaxed and human approach. ""On the Swing"" would be the perfect soundtrack to just that, a slow pendulum rhythm with lolling delivery from McMahan over gentle plucking from former Slint-man Tim Ruth. That cuts quickly to the mechanical groove of ""I Wear the Gold"", only interrupted by multi-tracked ""ooh"" and intermittent feedback. It's an experiment in tension, no more and no less.
    </p>
<p>
    In contrast, ""Imyr, Marshmallow"" puts patient sing-song vocals over sprightly children's show keyboards, the oddest and most surprising texture they'd ever pulled out, and its flat delivery remains creepy as shit. While ""Winter Lair"" and ""Salo"" were just as gaunt as later Slint (though the former pricks the ears with some rising sirens that would foreshadow the subtle atmospheric details of the self-titled), ""Preparing to Receive You"" digs an unhurried and unpretentious groove, the careful release of the guitar's low-end making it, if not quite hypnotic, a jam with some purpose.
    </p>
<p>
    I don't know what precipitated the jump to Matador for these two EP's, but having them under Touch and Go's auspices now just makes sense. Wary and even distrustful of aggressive self-promotion, Slint and their peers had curious listeners coming to them, and were it not for the label's saintly, stubborn insistence on keeping their records in print, Slint may never have developed the audience they did (Spiderland was actually-- surprise, surprise-- a slow grower). These two EPs are fairly divergent and don't make perfect sense on one disc, but it's a minor complaint when compared to the greater good: Now people will have time to revisit the For Carnation, and every last corner of the catalog is now available and accessible for discovery and re-discovery.<br/>

    time around that it's no shock the group/guy/studio construct's excellent second coming, <em>28 Later</em><span>, also</span> took people by surprise.<span> </span>The 2006 disc of classic-sounding Italo
    disco came with little corroborating documentation, and to this day its
    contents remain unclear. Did the album round up songs from the vaults, or did
    the elusive, reclusive Bernard Fevre come up with new tracks in the mold of his
    earlier late-70s/early-80s music? No one seems to know for sure.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    If the music did come from the vaults, and if there was more
    where it came from, you'd think Fevre would capitalize on it with a quick
    sequel. That <em>28 Later</em> has instead been followed by a more or less rote remix
    album <em>In Dub</em> implies one of three things. One, there's nothing left in the
    vaults, leaving it to remixers to extend the group's already limited legacy.
    Two, there is more to be dusted off, but not much, and Fevre intends to dole it
    out at a leisurely pace. Or three, <em>28 Later</em> was indeed of a more recent
    vintage than its retro sound indicated, but Fevre needed to buy some time to
    come up with more of the same.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    This being Black Devil, or at least their 21<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 9.16667px"">st</span>
    century reincarnation, <em>In Dub</em> isn't quite what it's billed as. Anyone
    expecting deconstructed versions of Fevre's already spare and streamlined songs
    will probably be disappointed by the autuer's jittery takes on his own tracks,
    which generally clutter up his cool sci-fi disco soundscapes with unnecessary
    sonic distractions that detract from their cyber-sexy awesomeness. ""On Just
    Foot (Dub)"" is total b-side doofiness, while the best bits of ""Coach Me (Dub)""
    and ""An Other Skin (Dub)"" are close enough to their original counterparts.
    Fevre (or whomever) has more fun with ""Constantly No Respect (Dub)"", playing
    with the levels, isolating some of the vocals, dropping the beat in and out,
    but nothing on Fevre's half of <em>In Dub</em> furthers advances the dialogue he
    decided to restart.
    </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The second half of <em>In Dub</em>, where Fevre lets a handful of
    likeminded fans have their way with his tracks, is also where the fun kicks in,
    and while it won't change the way you listen to <em>28 Later</em>, it at least better
    hints how much this stuff clearly resonates with Fevre's erstwhile descendants
    and adherents. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    ""The Devil in Us (En Francais)"" gets some acid house touches
    from Elitechnique, the results sounding more 1980s than even what Fevre drummed
    up. Some of the dissonant menace is gone, the beat's been boosted and, oh yeah,
    now the song's in French. ""On Just Foot (Slide Inside)"" features Prins Thomas
    having his Norwegian way with the tune, weaving Fevre's vocal doots and synth
    squelches into an even funkier confection that magnifies the sequencer pulse. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    In Flagranti seemingly slows down ""Coach Me (Again and
    Again)"", accenting the disco backbeat and downplaying the melody until its
    throbs like a druggy afterthought. Quiet Village transforms ""I Regret the
    Flower Power (Fragments of Fear)"" into ambient microhouse bliss, and Black
    Mustang's decision to replace the snare with handclaps heightens the disco
    euphoria. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Unit 4 doesn't do<span>
</span>anything special with the minimalist vamp ""An Other Skin (Days of
    Blackula)"", but like the best remixes it brings a few fresh ideas to the table
    without completely ignoring the song's original attributes. Like the rest of
    the remixes proper, It's enough to make waiting through Fevre walking in place
    worthwhile, rewarding your patience with savvy takes on Fevre's decidedly
    unsavvy retro-futurism.<span> </span>It's
    nothing new, but like everything else Black Devil's done, it'll at least make

    If you're already a Boom Bip fan, there's a chance that his <em>Sacchrilege</em> EP is going to piss you off. Until now, Bryan Hollon has produced electronic music for people who don't really like electronic music. His most exceptional work is also among his earliest: 2000's <em>Circle </em>album with leprechaun rapper Doseone, an unclassifiable and often nightmarish work that approached hip-hop as if it were action painting. But the solo album <em>Seed to Sun</em> and the two EPs that followed it found Hollon retreating to the jazzy, directionless territory DJ Shadow made safe for a whole generation of so-called experimental DJs.</p><p>
    Hollon's music began to show signs of life again on 2005's <em>Blue Eyed in the Red Room</em>, an album with relatively unfractured beats and analog synth clouds describing coherent melodic arcs. With guest vocals by Super Furry Animals' Gruff Rhys (with whom Hollon is collaborating on a full-length project this year) and Nina Nastasia, not to mention a welcome transparency, it felt like an album that wanted to engage listeners rather than keep them off-balance. And now, the straightforward <em>Sacchrilege</em> culminates Hollon's seven-year transition from pandemonium to order. It's a tight quintet of techno-inspired synth jams that have a lot more in common with Eliot Lipp's simple yet vibrant sequencing or Ratatat's stadium-sized squelch than Odd Nosdam's soft-focused beat collage.</p><p>
    Emphasis on techno-<em>inspired</em>: <em>Sacchrilege</em> finds Hollon severing his tenuous ties to indie hip-hop and jazz, but it will be a bit too rushed and songy for techno buffs. Instead, it's an album of driving electronic pop infused with Krauty mechanical pulsations, clubby, night riding synthesizers, and the sort of crystal-clear dynamic shifts Hollon has shied away from until now. And it has an infectious enthusiasm-- you can tell Hollon feels stoked to be making music that really <em>moves</em>, and in his eagerness, he tries on a variety of styles. Opener ""Snook Adis"" is an itchy Italo-disco sine wave that marks Hollon's first foray into music you could cruise to. ""Rat Tail"" is splashy, dot-matrix electro, and ""The Pinks"" is glossy new wave with interstellar synths and bucking cowbells. ""Coogi Sweater"" is a concentrically-rippled take on deep house, complete with coolly hedonistic lyrics from Ali Lee: ""Make your way/ To the bar/ Put me in your fancy car."" It's the album's surest sign that Boom Bip is letting his hair down and embracing a value that's often been lacking from his otherwise-intriguing music: fun. It's also what stands to alienate listeners who like Boom Bip as a defiantly un-jiggy undie auteur. People-- let a player play.

Corgan has hardly been in hiding since the Pumpkins were dissolved in 2000, making music first with short-lived supergroup Zwan and then under his own name for 2005's <em>TheFutureEmbrace</em>. That latter record's commercial fizzle was abetted by Corgan's newspaper-ad announcement-- on the very day of <em>TheFutureEmbrace</em>'s release-- that he was getting the band back together. Of course, the only actual reunion taking place was between Corgan and his most famous brand; drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was already involved in both post-Pumpkins projects, and James Iha/D'Arcy preferred to stay in hiding.</p><p>
    Thus, one couldn't help but feel that the Smashing Pumpkins revival wasn't little more than a calculated move for cash or attention or both. And, unsurprisingly, the strategy worked-- nobody could claim that <em>Zeitgeist</em> or the corresponding tour would have attracted nearly as much attention if the words ""Billy Corgan"" were at the top of that awful cover art instead of Smashing Pumpkins. But, it's possible, just maybe, that Corgan had artistic reasons for the switchback, genuinely wanting to reclaim the muse that led to his most artistically and commercially successful work, and add to the legacy of his most famous project. Hey, stranger things have happened.</p><p>
<em>Zeitgeist</em>'s replication of that old SP sound is impressive, despite the lack of half the original lineup...it's not like Corgan ever let D'Arcy or Iha do anything in the studio anyway. For a band that was stadium-size right out of the box, it's a return to the band's trademark overdriven and overblown M.O., inflated even further by a few tracks with legendary Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker. Corgan's guitar tone remains utterly unique, folding umpteen overdubs into the razor-sharp solos and grinding chords that are recognizable as his from the first note of ""Doomsday Clock"". Chamberlin, meanwhile, bashes with the same enthusiasm of his much younger self, helped by production that isn't afraid to push the drums front and center.
    </p><p>
    I'd be a liar if I didn't admit that it sounds big when compared to the relatively thin, wispy sound of the modern alt-rock competition. Songs like ""Doomsday Clock"" and ""Tarantula"" wave the flag of stoner rock like Black Sabbath and Blue Oyster Cult without embarrassment, and could likely pass for Queens of the Stone Age if it wasn't for that characteristic Corgan whine. On the other hand, this hard-rock approach only used to be one aspect of the Pumpkins persona, call it the ""Zero"" dimension. By focusing only on this portion of the group's character, Corgan misremembers the versatility that launched his band to the A-list: not just guitar-god bludgeoning, but epic psychedelia like ""Rhinoceros"", fragile pop like ""Today,"" wide-screen symphonics like ""Tonight, Tonight"", and synth-loop ballads like ""1979"".
    </p>
<p>
    Most of those flavors are suspiciously absent on <em>Zeitgeist</em>, making it far more aggressive than any other record in their catalog-- perhaps a preemptive response to charges of getting old and mellow. Unfortunately, that leaves the record rather homogenous; while Corgan still can pull out a melodic surprise (""7 Shades of Black"") or conjure up a dense effects-pedal atmosphere (""That's the Way (My Love Is)""), he lacks for variety. When he tries, the album-closing duo (depending on what chain store you bought the album from, I suppose) of ""For God and Country"" and ""Pomp and Circumstances"" are bland reminders of the synthy midtempo blandness that once tripped up <em>Adore</em>. When he stretches, as on the centerpiece ""United States,"" the result has none of the cosmic magnitude of previous 10+-minute Pumpkins epics, instead opting for a turgid, chugging pace and thimble-deep political commentary. 
    </p>
<p>
    That substitution of political angst for the personal kind is the one nod to maturity on <em>Zeitgeist</em>, though some of the get-happy sloganeering of Zwan persists as well on tracks like ""(Come On) Let's Go!"" Yet Corgan's serrated voice hasn't dulled with age, and unlike the refreshing heaviness of the band's restored sound, it sounds more and more ridiculous, well along the almost-inevitable march of all iconic rock voices towards self-parody. The disconnect between tortured nasality and lyrical content is never more awkward than on lazy tracks like ""Bring the Light"", where Corgan is content to merely whine the title with dozens of different inflections, or the chorus of Billys that backs up ""Starz"".
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, nobody wants progression from the Smashing Pumpkins, that's the whole point of manufacturing this reunion in the first place. In that sense, <em>Zeitgeist</em> is interesting as a demonstration that the artist himself is usually not be the best person to play historian for his own career. Given the chance to revisit the good old days, Corgan has unearthed only a portion of the Pumpkins character-- and while that portion is meticulously revived, all the parts left behind remain sorely missed. In the end, it's the one-dimensional approach, not the lack of half the original members, that leaves Smashing Pumpkins Mk. II a cardboard cutout of the real thing-- not the empty ATM-reunion it could have been, but still a ghost of the old band.

    Venerable rock critic Robert Christgau's strategy for
    appraising boxed sets and other retrospectives has always been a sensible one: Start with the end first and work your way backward. The thought is that acts
    generally don't get better over the course of their career, they get worse, so
    if the newer stuff tacked on at the end is as good as the older stuff, you're
    golden.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    It's not as simple with indie acts, though. Often the newer
    stuff is the music people hear first and like most, and the older material is
    the music people have to later seek out. Yes, there will always be fans that
    insist the new stuff pales in comparison to the old stuff, but when all it
    takes is a cheap recorder to document your songs forever, sometimes a little
    more experience (in life and the studio alike) leads to bigger and better
    things.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    So it's been with Matt Ward, whose artistic and commercial
    ascent has been consistently upward, and whose musical evolution has largely
    coincided with his recording budget. Long before he signed to Merge and recorded <em>Transfiguration of Vincent</em>, <em>Transistor Radio</em>, and <em>Post-War</em>, and well before he landed tour slots with pal Norah Jones, M. Ward was
    just another quiet and modest singer-songwriter aspirant.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Just because the likes of <em>Post-War</em> helped solidify his
    place on the musical map should not discount Ward's early work, though. In
    fact, most of the pieces are already in place on Ward's debut <em>Duet for Guitars
    #2</em>, originally released back in 2000 on Howe Gelb's Ow Om label. If Ward's subsequent albums explored antiquated sounds by
    way of artifice, <em>Duet for Guitars #2</em> came about the vibe naturally: it sounds
    ragged and lo-fi because it is, recorded on a shoe string but not necessarily
    the worse for it. In fact, the by-default austerity adds a lot to songs like
    ""Good News"", ""Were You There?"" and ""Who May Be Lazy"", though ""Look Me Over"" and
    the too-short ""Fishing Boat Song"" would have benefited from the clarity a
    better studio provides. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    There are certainly some lo-fi cobwebs draped over
    ""Beautiful Car"" and ""Not a Gang"" as well, but the dusty atmosphere works
    fine for what Ward is getting at. Elsewhere the two ""duet"" songs, ""Duet for
    Guitars #2"" (which starts the record) and ""Duet for Guitars #1"" (which ends it)
    even reveal a bit of the John Fahey fascination that bore strange fruit with
    Ward's appearance on the Fahey tribute <em>I Am the Resurrection</em>. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Working backwards toward this record, stripping away the
    tricks and tools Ward has used to polish up his act, is a journey worth taking.
    If he stopped recording today, the M. Ward boxed set would be as solid as they
    come, with the beginning sounding like just that-- a beginning-- but the rare
    beginning that works as well at the end as it does at the start. The folk
    underpinnings of <em>Duet for Guitars #2</em> point forward to what Ward most recently
    achieved with <em>Post-War</em>, just as every moment of <em>Post-War</em> (and each Ward disc
    in between) looks back to that first album, where he began.

    Since ancient times, the mystical healing powers of crystals and charmstones have been used by shamanistic cultures around the globe. But most modern scientists and physicians would credit whatever benefits might be attained by their use to a placebo effect or the power of suggestion. A similarly powerful, suggestive aura surrounds the work of psych-drone trio GHQ, and their latest small-batch document <em>Crystal Healing</em>. As with their rest of their output, the album is dense with tantalizing drone figures and ghostly melodies that hang mirage-like in the hovering mist, with a transportive effect that feels far too potent for any placebo.</p><p>
    Comprised of the prolific trio of Marcia Bassett (Double Leopards, Hototogisu, Zaimph), Pete Nolan (Magik Markers, Spectre Folk, Vanishing Voice) and Steve Gunn (Magik Markers, Moongang), the discography of GHQ seems now to have progressed them beyond the status of a mere offshoot or side project. <em>Crystal Healing</em> is the second GHQ full-length offering on Three-Lobed, following 2006's excellent live set <em>Heavy Elements</em>, and it finds the group further developing its shared private vocabulary. Though still frequently driven by acoustic instruments, there seems a marginal increase here in overall electricity, and as a result it feels slightly less like stumbling upon the fire circle of some obscure beachside cult. Filled with darting firefly guitar leads and shadowy effects, the album's slow-moving acid clouds can at points resemble those that handsomely billowed from the earliest trio versions of Charalambides.</p><p>
    Despite the continued simplicity of GHQ's general approach, <em>Crystal Healing</em> contains a surprising breadth and variety within its sun-damaged drones. ""Asphalt Rainbows"" could almost pass for Jewelled Antler folk at its most hallucinatory, with Nolan's zoned vocals constantly threatening to actually shape themselves into a coherent lyric. Elsewhere, however, on such amorphous tracks as ""Invitation In"" and ""Varunani Night Wave"" the trio strays much closer to the thick, seamless noise frequencies of Double Leopards. Throughout the album GHQ purposefully keep their exact sound sources and methods rather blurred, so that when an untreated acoustic guitar climbs to the forefront on ""Purple Sun for Exalted Ones"", or when what sounds to be a fuzzed-out electric bass threads its way through ""Radiance Illuminate"", the effect can be as that of catching the briefest glimpse of a lost city or forgotten civilization through the overgrown canopied forest.
    </p>
<p>
    The album reaches its ceremonial apex on the nine-minute closing title track, a piece that masterfully incorporates all of GHQ's various strands into a boundless, transfixing whole. Over a lo-fi Tony Conrad/Henry Flynt scraping drone, Gunn's guitar moves in elliptical patterns, dropping single notes like tiny lanterns floated onto a glassy, unlit pond. Early copies of <em>Crystal Healing</em> arrived with an extra disc that feature two extended bonus tracks, but the album on its own feels complete and self-contained as it again illustrates GHQ's considerable restorative powers. Placebo? If the final curative result is the same, what's the difference?</p></div>"|10388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10388-crystal-healing/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

    Last week's Beastie Boys release <em>The Mix-Up</em> didn't have much going for it, but it was funny. Mike D remaining a worthless drummer after a quarter century of being a worthless drummer was funny, and so was the ""Paradise City"" whistle on ""14th St. Break"". The concept was maybe even the funniest part: semi-dormant world-famous rap group releases weekend jam session and earns itself another four or five years off. No sweat, right? Can were funny. So were Out Hud. The Fucking Champs are still funny. Yngwie Malmsteen isn't, or not intentionally, anyway. Neither is Joe Satriani. A certain kind of white and underbitten sincerity was and is the death of that <em>Guitar World</em> crowd, a kind of hermetic obliviousness that just assumes people will bow down before a record because it's called <em>The Beautiful Guitar</em> or <em>Surfing with the Alien</em>.</p><p>
    Maserati have jokes too, sort of. Newly recruited drummer Gerhardt Fuchs of !!!, Turing Machine, and the Juan MacLean has a disgusting mustache, anyway, and he once got !!! bandmate John Pugh to describe him as ""a robot built by cavemen"" in a Village Voice feature. Maserati is also a fantasy joke title for an all instrumental post-rock quartet, evoking as it does sanitized speed and that kind of nerd-guitar action verb (<em>Flying in a Blue Dream</em>, <em>Rising Force</em>, <em>Marching Out</em>) so beloved by the shredder set. But it is with a sick sense of recognition that a listener realizes that the thing that does in fact come to mind when listening to <em>Inventions of the New Season</em>, again and again, is the unwished-for sight of a Maserati doing 95 around a corner or headed to the beach, taking the turns like a champ.</p><p>
    Progress on Maserati's new record is signified by things getting louder: an uphill climb that starts with idling guitars and ends at speed. For texture, imagine an instrumental U2-- ""Kalinichta"" is what would happen if ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" never made it past four bars. Delayed guitar lines weave in and out; bass and drums kick in, then push ahead. There is no counterpoint or contrast in up-tempo tracks like ""Inventions"", ""Synchronicity IV"", or ""Show Me the Season""-- just a forward lurch. Even the shoegazey ""Kalimera"" leans on the volume knob for its arc. With all the upward motion, Maserati dodges the post-rock quandary of build-and-release by skipping the release. But isn't that the really necessary part?
    </p>
<p>
    In Jeff Hobbs's recent novel <em>The Tourists</em> he writes about a kind of kinetic sculpture, ""a single wing suspended in a glass vacuum,"" the effect of which is to ""isolate one of the most beautiful and magical of worldly phenomena-- motion-- and strip away the beauty and the magic until there's nothing left but form-- black and smooth and shapeless."" Hobbs means to suggest an inability to connect, a kind of problematic drive towards sterility and control. These are also the obsessions embodied by <em>Inventions for the New Season</em>: all instruments rushing forward, Maserati streamlining their momentum until it's the only thing left to hear.<br/>

<div style=""direction: ltr"">
    This French dance act has spent years and years living up to its name, turning out singles, mixes, and remixes with a lovably brutal aesthetic-- a grim combination of flickering synthesizers, clenched-teeth rave-era energy, and calls back to the epic, addled clanging of old European hardcore. Along with acts like Vitalic, you might even give them some credit for helping usher the electro boom of the early 00s into the new land of grand, buzzy electro-house. And now, after the <em>very</em> significant departure of founder Ivan Smagghe, after bulking up to an actual instruments-and-all band, and after finally having gotten around to producing an LP, they offer us...bad metal? Instead of keeping up the clean-lined flicker of their best work, Black Strobe have slathered <em>Burn Your Own Church</em> in rock stuff: bottom-heavy power-chord snarl, lascivious grunting, and levels of dark posturing that rival the most ludicrous depths/heights of the goth era. Lengthy stretches sound like Trent Reznor, Glenn Danzig, and Korn have teamed up to host a Belgian drag competition.<p>
    I know, I know: That makes it sound kind of awesome, right? Except in this competition, Marilyn Manson wins, and the first ear-grabbing track is trying depressingly hard to sound like NIN's ""Closer"". The most mind-blowing thing about this album, in fact, is that it can spend so much time in the land of over-the-top ludicrous goth preening without ever getting any fun-- hell, not even any <em>camp-- </em>out of it. I mean, between Rammstein and last year's Eurovision song contest being won by guys who actually dress up as monsters, the stakes for dark-rock amazement are pretty high: Not even the French have much excuse for finding nu-metal chugging exciting and exotic, let alone anyone who's set foot in an American mall since 1992. Germany's T. Raumschmiere tried this two years ago, with his own electro-metal <em>Blitzkrieg Pop</em>, and it wasn't working then, either.</p><p>
    Granted, there's still a decent quotient of raw, pulsing synth around here (""Buzz Buzz Buzz""). A few of the band's electro-rock hybrids even achieve some grinding grandeur (""Last Club on Earth"")-- no doubt you'd be perfectly happy to hear one on a night out. But consider that only one track embarrasses itself enough to really win hearts: a cover of Bo Diddley's ""I'm a Man"", done over as a shuffling glam stomp. With Parisian Bo Diddley vocals. With a video featuring what looks like a teddy-boy Lemmy strutting around his own personal version of <em>Shaft</em>. There's a reason the video starts in front of a mirror: If you're gonna listen to something ridiculous, you might as well be able to make ridiculous faces, poses along with it, snarl along like a jackass in your car. And that's something the bulk of these tracks-- camp Diddley aside-- are surprisingly bad at facilitating.</p><p>
    Black Strobe may be a good thing, historically, but this record isn't: Stick with ""Me and Madonna"", or ""Italian Fireflies"", or ""Chemical Sweet Girl"", or their remixes of Bloc Party, Alter Ego, Playgroup, and the Rapture, or ""Nazi Trance Fuck Off"", or their ""Biggest Fan"" remix for Martini Bros.-- any of years and years of stuff that works a whole lot better than this.

    A quick introductory note for those with only a passing interest in home-listening electronic music: The Tuss is a new project on Rephlex that, due to a string of associations in the CD notes and various related MySpace pages, appears to have been authored at least in part (and probably completely) by Richard D. James, aka Aphex Twin. If it turns out that someone other than James created the Tuss tracks, it was a brilliant hoax, complete with clues-- such as James hailing from Cornwall and ""The Tuss"" being Cornish slang for an erection-- scattered in all the right places.</p><p>
    We don't know for sure if <em>Rushup Edge</em> is James' work, but it certainly <em>sounds</em> like a continuation of and expansion upon the ground covered two years ago with dogged thoroughness on the 11-volume <em>Analord</em> series. But where that project maintained clear aesthetic boundaries, in which tracks were generally grounded in early techno and electro and timbres were derived from analog synths, the tracks on <em>Rushup Edge</em> feel more open and less tied to orthodoxy. While the quality of the sounds still loosely refers to the late 1980s up through the mid-90s, there's a brisker, more breakbeat-driven approach to rhythm and less focus on repetition compared to the <em>Analord</em> project.</p><p>
    The first two tracks in particular are packed with nimble but deceptively complex variation, and seem especially suggestive of James' programming and compositional virtuosity. ""Synthacon 9"" is almost six-and-a-half minutes of propulsive techno, but it dashes by in as instant, so full of ideas the track can't contain them. Every bar or two another element is introduced-- a grinding acid bass riff, bright synths neatly inverting the pattern, a brief rainfall of electronic handclaps, some indecipherable vocodered vocals-- and each is perfectly balanced, eminently logical but still surprising. ""Last Rushup 10"" also zips along at a good clip, churning through loads of compelling bass and drum interplay. Then, all of a sudden, a self-conscious but undeniably catchy ""Far East"" melody played on a lone synth appears, an escapee from a Yellow Magic Orchestra track, and from then on everything else plays out in relation to this new tune. A pretty nifty trick.
    </p>
<p>
    The first two tracks are near-masterpieces in James' (or anyone else's) oeuvre, so it's not surprising that the rest of the EP doesn't quite conform to the same standard. But everything else is listenable and interesting in its own way. ""Shiz Ko E"" is comparatively straight electro with unusual use of a warped and queasy vocal, while ""Rushup I Bank 12"" seamlessly melds acid bass, rough breakbeats, and piano in a disorienting but beautiful tapestry. The abrasive percussion workout ""Death Fuck"" is a bit more trying-- its solo piano interlude sounds tacked-on-- while the closing ""Goodbye Rute"" is spare, ghostly, and pleasingly alien. The latter is closer in spirit to a couple of the excerpted tracks currently found on the <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thetussmusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Tuss MySpace</strong></a> page, none of which are included here. They suggest another side to whoever is behind this thing: one closer-- whadayah know?-- to the more melodic side of a certain Richard D. James. Stay tuned.

After all, his career was built upon media-image manipulation entering a decade that, with the advent of MTV, would become obsessed with it. But instead of trying to out-glam the growing legions of synth-pop insurgents copping his old alien/androgyne persona, David Bowie's defining image in this era was to just be David Bowie: a debonair pop idol with pin-up-worthy blond hair, designer suits, movie-star ambitions, and a camera-ready smile that shone brighter than a paparazzi pit. But if the first few years of the 80s saw Bowie score his biggest hits, the latter half found him in danger of losing his relevancy, and faced with the impossibility of sustaining his early, carefully cultivated mystique and vanguard reputation. You can chart this wayward path by his choice of side men: In 1980 his guitarist of choice was Robert Fripp; by 1987 it was Peter Frampton.</p><p>
    This third installment of the <em>Best of David Bowie</em> budget-comp series may begin at a year with a nice, round, inaugural number, but with respect to Bowie's discography, 1980 is a somewhat arbitrary entry point. Compared to what followed, the selections from his 1980 signature work <em>Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)</em> feel like the product of another era (not to mention another record company-- it was his last album for RCA before jumping to Virgin). The android funk of ""Fashion"", the Berlin-bound sleaze of ""Scary Monsters"", and the unnerving sing-along ""Up the Hill Backwards"" feel like the closing acts of a Teutonic-soul cycle that began with 1976's <em>Station to Station</em>, while the paranoid ""Ashes to Ashes"" sends the post-hippie/sci-fi idealism of Bowie's glam heyday crashing down to earth. As the ensuing decades have shown, these songs also marked the last time Bowie's pop and avant-garde instincts were so perfectly in sync.</p><p>
    Following his triumphant Queen collaboration ""Under Pressure""-- a song so awesome, not even Vanilla Ice could kill it-- the 80s would begin in earnest for Bowie with <em>Let's Dance</em>, whose authoritative title track aptly opens this loosely chronological compilation. For an album so inextricably linked to the year 1983, its MTV-saturated singles hardly bear the musty scent of retro artifacts: On his 2002 <em>Heathen </em>tour, Bowie performed a veritable live mash-up of ""Modern Love"", grafting the song's melody onto the galloping guitar groove of the Strokes' ""Someday"", perhaps as a sly nod to the New York newbies' copying skills, but also to remind us of the song's ageless bounce. Like Bowie's production work on <em>Raw Power</em> 10 years earlier, the <em>Let's Dance</em> redux of his 1977 Iggy Pop co-write ""China Girl"" was a goodwill gesture to boost the earning potential of his down-and-out buddy, but Bowie's more dignified performance has surpassed Iggy's original as the definitive take (although its bare-ass video may have given it an unfair advantage). Amid the hair-raising ""Twist and Shout"" teases of ""Let's Dance"", you almost overlook the uncanny contrast between the song's alluring, horny-funk accents and Bowie's leering, almost dread-ridden delivery.</p><p>
    The enduring appeal of <em>Let's Dance</em> is all the more remarkable when placed next to the poorly dated quality of Bowie's remaining 80s output. On previous <em>Best of David Bowie</em> installments, the obvious hits were supplemented by well-curated album tracks, but the paucity of exemplary material from 1984's <em>Tonight</em> (a.k.a. <em>Let's Dance Some More</em>) and 1987's <em>Never Let Me Down</em> don't provide much of an opportunity for reassessment: With its faux-steel-drum refrain and synth-polished easy-rock groove, <em>Tonight</em>'s ""Loving the Alien"" is hardly the epic its seven-minute run time suggests, while <em>Never Let Me Down</em>'s ""Day-In Day-Out"" captured Bowie in the unfortunate position of playing catch-up to Duran Duran three years too late. Additionally, the compilation is padded with Bowie's middling soundtrack contributions of the era, some of which hold up on the strength of the songwriting (the proto-Pulp soul of ""Absolute Beginners"", for instance), but several of which can't shake off their oh-so-80s accoutrement (the proto-Enigma new-age gothisms of ""This Is Not America"" from <em>The Falcon and the Snowman</em>, or the goofy ersatz gospel of <em>Labyrinth</em>'s ""Underground""). But hey, things could be worse-- thanks to this compilation's 1987 cut-off date, we're spared the task of reconsidering <em>Tin Machine</em>.</p></div>"|10274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10274-best-of-bowie-1980-1987/|6.0|Stuart Berman

    Boys with perpetual colds who can kinda-sorta sing, hand claps of the generic indie variety, and the unfettered production made most odious/ingenious by Wolf Parade are three features of BOAT's second album on Magic Marker. This lengthy collection of fuzzy, crackling lo-fi jams does little more than their debut to convince us of the band's merit, but I mean that as a compliment. Their viscous sound, with each instrumental part given equally muffled or tinny weight, at times yields some heavy little rock lullabies. The makeshift, ad-lib familiarity of the songs are, as is often the case with this genre, what makes them accessible and enjoyable; for the melodies to dig to a more sophisticated depth is an added bonus; and for them to avoid the anemic desperation of Spencer Krug is all right, too.</p><p>
    As members of Seattle's prolific rock scene, BOAT differentiate themselves most explicitly with songs like ""The Ferocious Sounds of Lobsters and Snakes/Mom, Dad, Me and You"", the first part of which has been floating around the Internet for a couple of years. Here, it takes on a re-recorded cleanliness, the tempo slowed just slightly and the guitar itching for a more substantial role than the easy two-note plucks in the chorus. The lyrics here, as elsewhere on the album, are comfortingly cliché: ""Don't you know, everything will be all right/ Don't you know, everything will be just fine."" The song is dead simple and inexplicably addictive.</p><p>
    Such conciliatory ruminations appear in many tracks, but are often unintelligible thanks to the band's penchant for basements. But when the words want to reach us, they really do, albeit as adorably stupid adages: ""All I want's a telephone that rings for free,"" ""There's a lightbulb in your head/ If you break it you'll be dead,"" or a helpful suggestion about not being able to fall asleep if one drinks too many sodas. The lyrics are often role-playing in nature, particularly suggestive of an adult borrowing the voice of his parents to speak to his childhood self. Less enjoyable are the ""ooh""s and handclaps of ""Illustrate the History (When I Grow Up)"", a sound too many times tried and sold, and which here says nothing new. More interesting is what follows, ""The Whistle Test"", which howls a little higher, a bit like Man Man's meowing habit, then slows to a trot for a closely recorded chorus with long keyboard notes that enhance the longing mood. Both the song's colorations, which alternate several times, are sophisticated, the faster portion letting the drums take the spotlight with a quick, complicated rhythm that settles down for the pleasantly dreary chorus.
    </p>
<p>
    The cheap production of these songs still allows for invention and different shades from the same instrumentation: the wall of noise of the synths in ""Period, Backlash, Colon"", the pretty vocals on ""A Phone that Rings for Free"", or the effects on the lovely closing minutes of ""Gold Veins (This One Hotel)"". Often what collects the drunken mess of the songs into an elegant pile, as in the case of ""Veins"", is D. Crane's vocals, which have the dexterity to volubly pack themselves in or stretch out over the course of the instruments' finicky tempos. But there are only a handful of songs that really delve immediately into our mind's ear and stay there, the rest still benefiting from their intra-song variety and general subversion to predictable structure. Showmates of the Shaky Hands, BOAT offer fewer hits but more keepsakes, with many of their songs becoming more adhesive as they simmer and soften over time.<br/>

    Since the release of You Say Party! We Say Die!'s first album in 2005, the ante's been upped on their brand of fiery, female-led dance-punk. Blatantly spawned from the Pretty Girls Make Graves/YYYs c. 2004 model of aggro-new wave, their debut, <em>Hit the Floor!</em>, parlayed exclamatory song titles and chic leftist propaganda into a formidable album that dropped at a opportunistic time. The genre hasn't exactly experienced a sea change since, but new acts like Love is All and Be Your Own Pet have necessitated a more nuanced spin for dance party melee albums. Just ask Pretty Girls, Thunderbirds are Now! or Le Tigre-- you can milk one, maybe two, solid records by strictly adhering to the dance-spaz formula, but this fundamentalism ages poorly.</p><p>
<em>Hit the Floor!</em>, as rank and file as it was, provided the band with a number of potential aesthetic tangents for follow-up <em>Lose All Time</em>. They channeled Pretty Girls' complex histrionics while keeping a stake in gritty garage punk and buoyant Hot Hot Heat-style pop-- it was only a matter of further honing the sound that worked best. <em>Lose All Time</em> codifies these influences into a markedly more consistent effort, though the result's still strangely anti-climactic.</p><p>
    Enthusiasm and the corresponding exclamation points are noticeably lacking on <em>Lose All Time</em>, and the band appears bent on maturing for maturity's sake. That's not to say sloganeering rockers like ""5 Year Plan"" or ""Poison"" don't have a pulse, but their breakneck austerity, when stretched over the span of an album, grows dull. ""Downtown Mayors Goodnight, Alley Kids Rule!"" and ""Opportunity"", while equipped with their share of explosive basslines and nifty hooks, demonstrate how much the band substitutes rote loud-soft dynamics for more original songwriting. The former even flaunts chorus riffs on an acidic level with Les Savy Fav, but it lacks that band's astute sense of rhythm, conceding instead to a vanilla verse that lackadaisically affixes high-hat sixteenths to a promising bassline.
    </p>
<p>
    The story of <em>Lose All Time</em> is about what could have been. Right now this album's a great first draft, something to mull over before flipping these well-trodden ideas on their heads. To their credit, the band tries a few change-ups, most notably the faux-Stars track ""Monster"" and raw piano ballad ""Dance Floor Destroyer"". Dance-punk, however, can wear down as quickly as the hand-me-down Zildjian high-hats it features, and YSP!WSD! needs to stop treading water and put together a coup. Almost entirely bereft of<em> Hit the Floor</em>'s political and musical quirks, you wouldn't know <em>Lose All Time</em> from a dance-punk Adam-- a shame considering how charming YSP!WSD!'s first impression was.</p></div>"|10008.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10008-lose-all-time/|6.8|Adam Moerder

    Search this band's name on Google and you'll find references to just the kind of cataclysms the songs evoke. These six tracks, remastered and reissued by OxBlood in the band's native Kansas City, Mo., create a fuller picture of a band than many longer albums; at 33 minutes this is an EP bursting at the seams with hefty pieces that boast, indulge, and haunt. At surface level the references are clear: leader Shaun Hamontree is a Tom Waits fanatic, and everywhere are up-to-the-minute contemporary draws-- a Tarantino scene change, a Neko Case bridge, a Low vocal-- that serve as modern touches to gothic artifacts.</p><p>
    This can lead us to several neighboring places. For one, the vertiginous funereal comedown of ""The Farm"", which manages to be both the warmest and most alienating of the tracks. At nearly eight minutes it alternately drones on and picks us up, like an unpredictable wind, the mournful vocals switching dominance with a more energetic percussion section, both of which Hamontree conducts with his central and overpowering role at the microphone. So early in the album this song could prophesy a leaden second half, but as it turns out, the band prefer to intersperse tempo ranges, alternating slow, heavily reverbed guitar tracks with the faster, stormier pieces dominated by drums.</p><p>
    The musical cues evoked when the four members come together are far more interesting: It's a tumultuous yet controlled breed of rock that appears to communicate deeper than some of the rangy dustbowl guitar solos and explosively sad choruses elsewhere. ""Wither"" is the best example of this, though melodically it's more familiar, with twinkling, ominous arpeggios skittering around thick resolutions in bass and guitar at the chorus. The references in ""Wither"" are as much to sophisticated metal as to country and blues. 
    </p>
<p>
    The bow-out, ""Tension"", has a scintillating beauty that will remind listeners of Explosions in the Sky, whose fascination with simple repetitive guitar lines performed in peaceably empty outer space is transformed here, branded with American Catastrophe's smoke-filled noise-making. A delicate few notes on the electric guitar build up through their own monotony, leading to the inevitable crash and burn of cymbals and bass in the final seconds. As a teaser to what this band is currently working on (these songs were first recorded in 2005), <em>Excerpts</em> is confusingly colorful, painted in various shades of gray and blood red.<br/>

    On last year's <em>King</em>, T.I.'s scrappy street-kid swagger seemed indivisible from his pop instincts, and that's partly why it was one of the year's best rap albums. On older records like 2003's <em>Trap Muzik</em>, T.I. built an image of himself as a haunted, remorseful drug-dealer, balancing triumphant anthems like ""Rubberband Man"" with sad, introspective laments like ""Be Better Than Me"". By the time he released <em>King</em>, though, the emotional resonance was all but gone from his music, replaced by a world-conquering confidence unmatched in rap. Titanic bangers like ""What You Know"" and ""Top Back"" didn't work in <em>spite</em> of T.I.'s guttural sneer; they used that harshness as fuel. But T.I.'s new album, <em>T.I. vs. T.I.P.</em> operates on the thin and dubious concept that T.I. the businessman and T.I.P. the unreformed hustler are two completely different entities, and that the strain of balancing the two personas is enough to tear Clifford Joseph Harris Jr. apart. Apparently, those two sides aren't as indivisible as they once seemed.</p><p>
    T.I. first explored this dichotomy on <em>Trap Muzik</em>'s ""T.I. vs. T.I.P."", crafting an argument that movingly dramatized his internal struggle. That struggle also serves as the concept for the new album: T.I.P. gets the first seven tracks, T.I. the next seven, and the two sides spend the last four songs hashing out their differences. It's an interesting conceit, but it doesn't really work as a hook for an entire album, and the record's exhaustingly long running  time pushes the conceit far past the breaking point. For one thing, it's a pacing disaster; by lining up all his sugary for-the-ladies tracks in a row, T.I. leaves a long dead-streak in the second half of the album. For another, it plays against his strengths. His music works best when both sides of his personality are allowed to co-exist in the same track. When they're separated, they both sound emaciated and half-formed. And he never quite commits to the concept. If T.I. represents the rapper's pop half, why do the album's first two singles come from the T.I.P. section? If the album's final stretch is meant to unite both sides, why do they confront each other in song only once, on the second verse of ""Respect My Hustle""?</p><p>
    Unsurprisingly, the strongest stretch of the album comes from T.I.P. On songs like the underwhelming first single ""Big Shit Poppin'"" and the clichéd drug-dealer instruction-manual ""Da Dopeman"", the rapper seems to be on autopilot, but a few of the T.I.P. tracks would've been highlights even on <em>King</em>. On ""You Know What It Is"", he rides Wyclef Jean's sublimely summery rubber bassline, intuitively sinking into the beat and savoring the sound of his voice. ""Watch What You Say"" boasts a bluesy organic thump and the most authoritative Jay-Z guest-verse in a couple of years, and T.I.'s throaty snarl conveys menace infectiously. On ""Hurt"", he keeps pace with Danja's royal horns and riotous drums and the fiery guest-verses from Alfamega and (surprisingly) Busta Rhymes. 
    </p>
<p>
    The T.I. suite doesn't fare so well, partly because its mere existence positions it as a compromise. T.I.'s cruise-ship money-talk never feels as urgent as his grimy side, and bored and lazy guest-verses from Eminem and Nelly-- both of whom sound like shadows of their former selves-- don't help anything. The best that can be said about the T.I. section is that it mostly doesn't sound all that different from the T.I.P. section; beats from Just Blaze and the Runners are as convincingly hard as anything elsewhere, and T.I. uses the same cadence and delivery whether he's talking about spending money or killing you. If the final act works more consistently than the previous two, it's more because of its two slyly synthetic Danja beats than because of any trenchant insights the rapper comes up with. </p><p>
    Even if the concept falls flat, though, <em>T.I. vs. T.I.P.</em> still warrants a listen, if only because T.I. seems constitutionally incapable of releasing an album full of uncompelling music. As a rapper, he's still a dominant voice; his slurry, guttural drawl is a great instrument, and always keeps it deep in the track's pocket, occasionally whipping out tricky double-time patterns or murmuring singsong melodies. The album is perhaps best heard in chunks; only a few of these songs wouldn't sound great on shuffle. Heard as a piece, though, the album's momentum sputters and dies more than once; after a few consecutive listens, T.I. sounds dour and joyless, like he's just punching the clock. 
    </p>
<p>
    Shortly after the release of <em>King</em>, T.I.'s friend Philant Johnson was shot dead after a nightclub brawl between T.I.'s entourage and some Cincinnati thugs. After Johnson's death, T.I. mentioned that the business of rapping no longer felt good and admitted that he was seriously considering quitting music altogether. On <em>T.I. vs. T.I.P.</em>, he repeatedly makes reference to Johnson, and indeed he rarely displays the spark and verve that gave <em>King</em> much of its power.  <em>T.I. vs. T.I.P.</em> may be self-obsessed and self-indulgent, but maybe T.I. needed to make this album to keep himself interested. Let's hope he's gotten it out of his system.

    Arthur Lee seems so embedded in the 1960s that it's hard to
    imagine him existing outside that decade. Strongly influenced by the baroque folk-pop of the Byrds, his smart,
    steely psychedelia conveyed a dark vision of hippie America-- a distinct contrast to the good vibrations typically associated with the Summer
    of Love. That was the same year-- 1967, for those of you who don't read <em>Rolling Stone</em> (which I think might be everybody)-- that Lee and his band Love released its scene-paranoid
    masterpiece <em>Forever Changes</em>, on
    which he painted himself as a true L.A. outsider, haunting the scrub-brush hills
    and looking deep into the dark heart of the city around him. In those songs, he
    foretells his own doom, and everyone else's: On ""The Red Telephone"", he sings, ""Sitting on the hillside/ Watching all the people die/ I'll feel much
    better on the other side.""</p><p>
    Following <em>Forever
    Changes</em>, Lee dissolved the now-classic Love line-up-- including songwriter
    Bryan McLean and childhood friend Johnny Echols-- and reformed the band with an entirely different cast of characters for his final Elektra album, <em>Four Sail</em>,<em> </em>in
    1969. Lacking Echols' effortless inventiveness on guitar, Jay Donnellan was a
    perfect foil for Lee, and the rhythm section of Frank Fayad on bass and George
    Suranovich on drums lent a lean menace to their jams. Lee originally intended <em>Four Sail</em> as an epic double album,
    but the label whittled it down to a short ten tracks, including opener ""August""
    and closer ""Always See Your Face"". The remaining tracks were released by Bob
    Krasnow's Blue Thumb Records three months later as <em>Out Here</em>, followed by <em>False
    Start</em> in 1970. These two albums, only sporadically in print since then,
    have now been remastered and collected on a 3xCD, limited-edition set by Hip-O
    Select, which also includes a concert's worth of previously unreleased live tracks and strangely cursory liner notes by Dave Thompson. Imperfect but
    fascinating, these albums-- and this set-- are essential listening for Love fans, tracking Lee's sad decline into the
    70s.</p><p>
    Neither of these albums live up to the standards
    set by Love's <em>Da Capo</em> and <em>Forever Changes</em> LPs and early singles.
    There are many more digressions, failed experiments, and too much general fucking
    around, all of which is heightened by Lee's pointed bitterness. Nevertheless, there are
    moments of genuine and heartbreaking clarity on all three discs in this set,
    when Lee speaks creatively and strongly or when the band hits an effortless
    groove. <em>Out Here</em> ranges wildly, with
    two tracks passing the 11-minute mark (including a pointless
    rehearsal-level drum solo from Suranovich) and twice that many fall short of
    two minutes. 
    </p>
<p>
    Opener ""I'll Pray for You"" is immediately poppy and playful,
    reminiscent of Love's pre-<em>Changes</em>
    output; its catchy, multilayered call-and-response hook might best be
    described as jangle gospel. The sing-songy melody of ""Abalony"" works better
    than the military marching band parody on the embarrassing ""Discharged"" or the
    lengthy freak-outs on the tiring ""Doggone"" and ""Love Is More Than Words or Better Late
    Than Never"". The sequencing is awkward, too, making the album seem like more of a mess
    than it really is and further highlighting Lee's caginess: ""Once I had a singing
    group/ Singing group done gone,"" he remarks on ""Doggone"". ""Now I got another
    group/ Didn't take too long."" This new Love isn't a pop band, but a rock band,
    and Lee's hostility toward his listeners and fellow bandmates makes
    the band's name strikingly ironic.
    </p>
<p>
    Lee's eclecticism serves him much better on <em>False Start</em>, which is generally a much
    more palatable album than its predecessor. Lee and his group-- with Gary Rowles
    replacing Donnellan-- jump playfully among styles, from the relatively sunny
    soul of ""Keep On Shining"" to the Sly Stone funk of ""Love Is Coming"" to the
    simple, lively folk-pop of ""Flying"". Opener ""The Everlasting First"", which
    features Jimi Hendrix playing (but not singing), begins abruptly, jostling the listener
    into Lee's world, then segues suddenly into ""Flying"", as if it's only a snippet
    of an infinite song. The live version of ""Stand Out"" actually begins in the
    fade-out of ""Gimi a Little Break"", with Lee introducing the song to a lively
    audience. The studio version of ""Stand Out"" originally appeared on <em>Out Here</em>, but it seemed lost on that
    overly busy album. Here it sounds like a near-perfect piece of slyly subversive
    funk-rock, urging listeners to ""stand out!"" rather than assimilate into a
    crowd.
    </p>
<p>
    On these two albums, Lee repeatedly refers to other artists
    and other songs, which doesn't anchor him to the mainstream culture but reiterates his underground detachment. This constant dissociation heightens the
    lively tension on the live disc, which was recorded at various stops on the
    band's 1970 tour of England.
    Like the studio version that closes <em>Out
    Here</em>, ""Gather 'Round"" appropriates the melody from Dylan's ""The Times They
    Are A'Changin'"", not out of laziness but as a pointed commentary on the death
    of that generation's idealism. Lee thrives on complication and
    contradiction: As either a supremely cynical or a playful gesture, he turns the
    song into an impromptu cover of Wilson Pickett's ""Funky Broadway"". Similarly,
    he performs songs from every Love album (including a particularly caustic
    ""Bummer in the Summer"" from <em>Forever
    Changes</em>) as a means of acknowledging his past glories as well as his
    fraught history. Live, this version of Love sounds like a band mustering the
    conviction to take on the world one more time. But they never did: Lee
    disbanded the line-up shortly after the tour. Love would barely see the 70s,
    except as a series of failed reunions.

    Like the Beta Band without all the artsy detours and experimental tendencies, A Band of Bees (just the Bees outside the U.S.) are a pop music recycling plant, melting down the 1960s and 70s and pressing them into something new. Their steadfast loyalty to up-front pop puts them in a bizarre place about halfway between the Betas and Dodgy, both of whom they occasionally resemble, but the quality of their material gives them the strength to stand on their own.</p><p>
    Originally a duo of multi-instrumentalists from the Isle of Wight, A Band of Bees these days is a sextet of multi-instrumentalists, and <em>Octopus</em>, their third album, spills over with psychedelic playfulness and splotches of vintage r&amp;b. The album's worldview seems to be summed up in one of its own song titles, ""(This Is for the) Better Days"", which, judging from the production, occurred sometime between 1965 and 1974. The lead guitar has a bit of a Stax/Steve Cropper sound, rooted to a funky drumbeat and Rhodes groove, and the big harmonies on the chorus nod to freakbeat and the moment when British psych was just about to tip into early prog.<br/></p><p>
    The band's r&amp;b edge is a key component of several of the album's best songs, including ""Listening Man"", which retrofits a Memphis backbeat with horns and sublimely loose three-part harmony. ""Left Foot Stepdown"" does even better, tying a tremendous brass arrangement with a Spanish tinge to a choppy beat and some superb organ playing. The harmony vocals slot in when the horn part is about halfway to Seville, and the band dubs out the breakdown after the second chorus.
    </p>
<p>
    Plenty of bands seem to forget that having memorable instrumental parts makes the vocal parts more memorable, but that's not a lesson lost on the Bees, who consistently hook you before even opening their mouths. ""Got to Let Go"" has a killer organ riff from the Rod Argent playbook, which it echoes in the sax-heavy horn arrangement. The drumbeat is a relentless modified shuffle that sweeps everything swiftly along.
    </p>
<p>
    There are very few misplaced steps on the album-- from the opening slide guitar riff all the way to end it gives you things to latch onto. Closer ""End of the Street"" is the weakest offering, mostly for the fact that it tries too hard to be eccentric and loopy. But a poorly conceived ending can't obscure that <em>Octopus</em> is a fun, supremely engaging album of modern psych-pop.<br/>

    Do they have front porches in outer space? Because <em>Plastic Bag in the Tree</em>, the first and quite possibly only album by the Flash Hawk Parlor Ensemble, blends down-home guitars and spacey synths as if they were recorded between episodes of ""Firefly"". Or, perhaps more likely, between Neighborhood Watch Association meetings: headed by Chris Funk, of Decemberists and ""Colbert Report"" fame, the Ensemble includes many of his Portland neighbors, who reportedly held loose, impromptu jams on the Funks' front porch. The result is an album of instrumentals (Does Funk sing? He does everything else.) that blend the organic and the synthetic in a way that's not necessarily unique, but weirdly charming all the same. The Ensemble won't ever be anyone's day job, but it's a quaint diversion.</p><p>
    The songs' guitars, courtesy of Funk and George T. Drag, have a dusty wagon trail stateliness that's usually at odds with the album's extraterrestrial blips and squiggles-- the ""sound shapes,"" as the liners call them. Opener ""Chained to the Pole"" could easily provide the expository text crawl for a homemade re-shoot of <em>Star Wars</em>, and ""The System of Your Choice"" sounds like two R2 units gettin' it on. The pensively plucked acoustic theme on ""Can't See the Moon? Cut Down the Tree"" is interrupted by what sounds like the rush of an unsealed airlock, but live instrumentation doesn't always connote earthliness on <em>Plastic Bag</em>, nor do the sonic baubles always suggest spaceship mechanics. Victor Paul Nash's halting trumpet on ""Sleep at Last!"" sounds like ladies and gentlemen floating in space, while Mark Petty's forlorn horn makes Ray Davies' ""I Go to Sleep"" seem as curious as ""Fantastic Planet"". The Ensemble also cover Massive Attack's ""Teardrop"", but even better is Radiohead's ""Amnesiac/Morning Bell"" performed on banjo and dulcimer, which effectively deflates the original's posthuman pretensions.</p><p>
    By ""Not Always Your Best Friend"", which is punctuated by mechano-canine barks, the album starts to seem like a shaggy-dog campfire story-- overlong and a little repetitive. But <em>Plastic Bag in the Tree</em> is not the space detritus it could easily have been. Some judicious editing might have pared the album down to a more manageable length, but would have also gone against the spirit of the endeavor, whose endearing traits are its loose and loopy geniality, its pick-up session informality, its head-beyond-the-clouds whimsy.</p></div>"|10371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10371-plastic-bag-in-the-tree/|6.7|Stephen M.

It seems like it's pretty difficult to screw up. Sure, you can mutate the blueprint slightly-- maybe get a geeky, adenoidal romantic to front your band like the Modern Lovers or have a distinct sense of underlying melancholy like Badfinger-- but just so long as you can find that happy medium between the British Invasion and new wave, you'll be just about set. The hooks pretty much write themselves, penning clever lyrics takes a backseat to singing them with a loveable-rogue bravado, and there's just enough rhythmic, riff-sustained momentum in two-and-a-half minutes to keep the song stuck to listeners' forebrains for about three times that long. But most dedicated music fans tend to gravitate towards evolutionary steps forward rather than artisan-quality traditional formula, which leads to the inevitable question: Is there something worthwhile in a band that's good at doing something really simple and exceedingly familiar?</p><p>
    That being asked, here are the Safes: They do nothing you haven't heard before, and they do it better than most. The outfit from Chicago-- centered around brothers/multi-instrumentalists/vocalists Frankie, Michael, and Patrick O'Malley-- have operated as a modernized power pop throwback for most of this decade, assuming that anyone who operates in a genre that's consistently existed from the Raspberries to Greg Kihn to Fountains of Wayne can be feasibly deemed a ""throwback."" <em>Well Well Well</em> fits that continuum neatly, rarely pushing the envelope much further than the conceits that Cheap Trick are godhead and the pre-<em>Village Green Preservation Society</em> Kinks could've used a few more volts in 'em.</p><p>
    It's a plan they pull off well, even if they lack some of the things that make their peers singular. There's not much of the New Pornographers' unpredictable artiness or the Exploding Hearts' speaker-rupturing hyperactivity in their repertoire-- think more along the lines of the Nerves and the Quick and other abruptly-named, fleetingly-extant late 70s merchants of simple-but-mesmerizing pop. Most of the record's pull is in the vocals, a close-harmonizing blur of nasal sneers and surly misery that says more about the ups-and-mostly-downs of distrust and romantic frustration than the words do. Not that the lyrics are always an afterthought-- there are some evocatively bitter phrases running through the titular choruses of ""Since Trust Went Bust"" and ""Bliss This Instance""-- but they're usually so bluntly straightforward (""Only in Your Mind"" actually opens with the phrase ""Now no matter what I do/ You think I am in love with you"") and half-buried in the mix that the only thing that really comes across distinctively in the voices is their perfect tone of contempt.</p><p>
    There are probably worse things to muddy up the vocals than the Safes' instrumentation, though, which answers the what-if of the Raconteurs as a Jack White-less power trio. Even if most of their reference points predate the Reagan administration, there's a decent variety of styles: ""Phone Book Full of Phonies"" takes glam-stomp's boogie and strips out all the excess weight to make it run faster, ""Deception"" condenses the limber debauchery of early 70s Rolling Stones into 1:47, and ""Bliss This Instance"" takes the aforementioned Kinks-circa-'66 vibe to a raucous, horn-filled conclusion. It's all done with a workmanlike rock-vet professionalism, and while it's somewhat unremarkable in itself, the Safes do pull off an interesting feat: creating an album that's unsurprising without actually being boring.<br/></p></div>"|10387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10387-well-well-well/|6.3|Nate Patrin

Frontperson Emily Haines was born in India, raised in Canada, and eventually wound up splitting her time between London and Brooklyn, where she and Metric guitarist James Shaw once lived with future members of Liars and Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Haines, a vocal critic of consumer society, also licenses her songs to television dramas and Polaroid commercials (a bowdlerized version of the title track from <em>Grow Up and Blow Away</em> was used to promote I-Zone film). In fact, Metric's songs are often characterized by a commercial sheen-- they're smart little packets that, even as anti-consumerism screeds, have a compact luster that makes you feel like getting online to price experimental shelving units from Ikea or browsing all-over print hoodies at H&amp;M.</p><p>
    None of this is to criticize Metric for hypocrisy, it's simply to position them as a band that has no qualms about jockeying for visibility-- in the process amassing reams of the sort of context that can sometimes drown out a band's music. So you might know Metric for any of the reasons above, or from Emily Haines' solo project, Emily Haines and Soft Skeleton, or from her otherworldly vocal turn on Broken Social Scene's beloved ""Anthem for a Seventeen-Year-Old Girl"". And yeah, you might also know them as yet another band in the Broken Social Scene constellation, although they more closely resemble the glossy electro-pop of Stars.</p><p>
    But this album, Metric's lost debut of sorts, gives us a chance to get to know them more intimately-- as a charming singer/songwriterly band poised to arrive a little too late for the 1990s alterna-rock boom, when they would have fit in snugly with bubble-poppers, like Letters to Cleo, and scorers of imaginary films, like Self. While both of Metric's official LPs, 2003's <em>Old World</em><em> Underground, Where are You Now? </em>and 2005's <em>Live it Out</em> were met with a generally favorable critical reception (the latter was nominated for the Polaris Prize and the Juno), the negative responses often took the band to task for bloat and clutter.
    </p><p>
<em>Grow Up and Blow Away</em> was recorded between 1999 and 2001, and was meant to be Metric's debut LP, but it got lost in the shuffle when their label, Reckless Records, was purchased by Rykodisc. The album has been available on the internet for years, but this marks its first hard release, and it showcases Metric as a two-piece, before bassist Josh Winstead and drummer Joules Scott-Key became permanent members. As such, there's less leeway for clutter, and Haines' arresting songwriting (not to mention her fertile rapport with Shaw) shines through. The album is fully a product of Metric's signature style, where electro-pop, trip-hop, and good old indie rock underpin Haines' effortless charisma. Despite its textural richness, it's feather-light; it's also comely and stylish. In fact, Metric's neophyte effort might be their best.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Grow Up and Blow Away</em>'s phrasing is redolent of another album that was being recorded around the same time, which also felt like it could have made some mainstream waves had it appeared a few years earlier and shed a few experimental tendencies: Dismemberment Plan's <em>Change</em>. It's stiffly funky, with prickly mechanical drums, supple bass lines, and skittering piano loops as its propulsive grist. Guitars are present, but they take a backseat to the pianos, and when the do appear, they're often deployed so texturally they sound more like guiros. It's structured more like disco than indie rock: simple, striking passages that would be easy to retrofit for an extended mix loop and shuffle. Like Travis Morrison, Haines is more attuned to the stylized melodies of modern r&amp;b than indie rock's more naturalistic, colloquial singing style. She swings with a simple yet elegant dexterity from syllable to bell-clear syllable. This especially comes to the fore on ""The Twist"", a dreamy r&amp;b synth dirge that sounds like a mannered precursor to Cocorosie's ""Werewolf"". 
    </p>
<p>
    Haines' lyrics are also remindful of Morrison's, with their pithy, existential inclinations. The title track, a meditation on suburban ennui set to an ice-blue ribbon of fizzy synths, gives us the first of the album's many modern koans: ""If this is the life, why does it feel so good to die today?"" (or ""fly away,"" as Polaroid would have it). ""Hardwire"", sultry and chiming, gives us the skyscraping chorus ""You are everything; you are nothing at all."" And ""Rock Me Now"", a spoken-word piece about burning out in Vegas, is almost hard to swallow, but Haines really sells it. Perhaps her confidence stems from having Paul Haines, a poet who often collaborated with jazz muscians, for a father, most notably on <em>Escalator Over the Hill</em> with Carla Bley. But that work was dark and impenetrable in the Scott Walker mold, while ""Rock Me Now"" is a jazzbo wisp, breezy and trim. It's a manicured lawn to her father's impenetrable weeds. ""His value declined when he offered his name,"" Haines breathes, slipping into a staccato backing harmony as Shaw echoes her in eerie falsetto over a disco churn. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""My old flame broke the 12-bar blues just to prove he could,"" Haines coos amid the splashy drums and mincing pianos of ""On the Sly"". ""He pays the airline DJs now; he is everywhere,"" while the kids ""get high and eat TV."" With evocative lines like these, Haines roughs out the proportions of her subjective world, focusing on whatever details command her attention from her post in its very center. And she doesn't take this subjectivity for granted: ""Climb the wall to make the sun rise in time,"" she sings on ""Soft Rock Star"" (which appears here in two distinct yet complementary versions). This drive to render the world not as a set of facts, but as a phantasmagorical realm wholly contingent on the presence of a viewer, gives the album its lyrical heft and specific personality. Paired with early Metric's less-is-more approach, it makes for an immersive record that feels much fresher than its long incubation period would seem to warrant.

    If there's any doubt
    in your mind that King Khan's got a smirk on his face throughout the entirety of <em>What Is?!</em>, take a listen to the lyrics
    of its final track, ""The Ballad of Lady Godiva"": ""The sex was so
    simple/ I swear I saw God/ On the top of white mountains/ On the top of my
    rod."" Even then, with a breath of relief that sounds more like early
    hiss-soaked Sebadoh than the gods of rock and soul Khan exhaustively pays
    tribute to throughout the record, it retains its musty vintage
    charm and spiky sense of humor.</p><p>
    There's a reason Atlanta upstarts Black Lips cited Montreal's King Khan's other band, the BBQ Show, as
    <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/42406-guest-list-black-lips""><u>recent favorites</u></a></strong>, and it's not just their shared affinity for <em>Nuggets</em> box sets and Eric Burdon. Both bands are more than just revivalists,
    but pranksters too, from their tongue-in-cheek lyrics, unpredictable live
    shows, impenetrable self-mythologizing press, and ""live"" albums (yeah,
    ok, <u><strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/41329-los-valientes-del-mundo-nuevo"">you
    got me</a></strong></u>). Buying into the act isn't just a question of suspending disbelief
    and taking their hand for a magic carpet ride; it's being willing to smile
    after the shock of the hand buzzer.</p><p>
    Thing is, the gritty
    production of this latest Shrines record might beat Black Lips in the  painstaking reproduction department, and
    underneath that analog hiss is a clever pastiche that hits those nostalgia buttons
    while sneaking in moments of cacophony and synthesis. ""69 Faces of
    Love"" adds strings and brass to cool ""Love Potion No. 9""-style
    rock before a layered and bewildering bridge that's like a middle-school
    marching band taking on Steve Reich. Elsewhere, Khan plays a bizarro-world
    James Brown who demands only bum notes from his band on the breakdown of
    ""Land of the Freak"", and ""In Your Grave"", with its bubbling
    wah-wah over a simmering rhythm section, is another sly nod to the future (or
    at least the early 1970s).
    </p>
<p>
    No need to underline those
    moments, though, when you've got pitch-perfect 60s pop like ""Welfare
    Bread"" and ""I See Lights"" and horn-laden hard-rock like ""(How
    Can I Keep You) Outta Harms Way"". Innovation's just as important here as
    finding the right second to shout ""guitar!"" before the solo (check
    ""No Regrets"").  The retro
    shtick almost becomes a spoonful of sugar to make their cross-pollination go down,
    with the only explicitly adventurous moments being the Eastern-nodding
    psychedelic globe-boner of ""Cosmic Serenade"" and the French-sung
    ""Le Fils de Jacques Dutronc"", their tribute to a similarly scornful garage
    rocker and maybe the only hint that this band is Canadian. Rather than making
    the audience the butt of their prank, <em>What
    Is?!</em> becomes a joke that anyone can enjoy without necessarily being in on.
    There's no reason you should take this record more seriously than the King
    himself, and no reason you can't embrace it: <em>What Is?!</em> is goofy, affecting, nostalgic, and cathartic all at once,
    at every moment.

At any given time, billions of births, growths, reproductions, and deaths are simultaneously happening, and an attempt to take it all in is impossible at best.  But, nevertheless, Wyland-- with a group of Oregonian collaborators in tow-- approaches nature with a broad scope: The sound design on his eponymous debut under this name feels composed by his amplification of the taken-for-granted.  His process, unconscious as it might be, leads to an album of free music that is dynamic and serene; songs guided by an understanding of the bucolic that grasps its elegance as well as its occasional tumult.</p><p>
    Wyland is a classically-trained pianist, and the instrument's inventive incorporation couples with his unique treatment of stringed noisemakers to lend <em>Au</em> an intriguing baroque and experimental sensibility.  On the patient instrumental ""Shelter"", a saloon-tuned piano slowly rises from a murk of rolling drone, anticipating the jingling, druidic-style chant at its climax.  Album-closing ""Ask the River"" resembles the rhythmic explorations of composer Arnold Dreyblatt, whose unique timbral inclination led him to, among other things, string upright basses with piano wire and strike them until they came together.  ""River"" feels like a rural cousin of Dreyblatt's <em>Nodal Excitation</em>; acutely plucked strings slowly accumulate, eventually coalescing into a distinguishable chime of their own.</p><p>
    For simple genre-placement purposes, <em>Au</em> can be grouped with what's generally referred to as ""avant-folk.""  The record's first two songs especially stand out in this regard, with a strong resemblance to the howling revelry of Animal Collective.  ""Boute"" and ""Sum"" feel like <em>Feels</em>-- cresting toward intense, sun-scorched melodic moments, then receding into incessant tick-tacks and smeared snarls of instrumentation-- and establish ideas that reappear in various guises throughout the record.  ""Boute"" opens with a clacking rhythm guiding an elegant piano motif, before Wyland's partially discernible vocals expand and lead the song skyward.  Only for a moment, however; in one fell swoop, all vanishes save the piano, leaving the song to rise again, which it does magnificently.  ""Sum"" takes an even more suite-like approach, beginning with an intense fanfare that abruptly gives way to a brief ukelele, which also suddenly stops.  Zoë Wright's weightless vocals glide over a frolicking foundation of toy piano and increasingly hyperactive strings, and the whole thing breaks into a canter.  The song ends as a radiant hootenanny, a blustery tribal tangle that threatens to explode, but instead gracefully glides back to earth. </p><p>
    Sarah Winchester (A Weather) contributes vocals to the slow-burning ""Death"", which highlights <em>Au</em>'s Appalachian underpinnings, and demonstrates that often, on the other side of the blinding light is waiting a somber black.  In stark contrast to what came before it, ""Death"" is all empty space and sepulchral sentiment, as Winchester and Wyland's lament drags forward like a horse-drawn coffin: ""Bring me my death/ Bring me my shadow.""  The instrumental ""Remain"" follows ""Death"" like a time-lapse of ivy growing on a headstone: Resonating piano notes, buzzing plucked strings, and percussive miscellany slowly mature and fill space, accelerated when a menacing drum and threatening high-pitched rattle appear suddenly.</p><p>
    Visitors to Au's website seeking a proper pronunciation of the group's name are informed by Wyland that how it's said is up to them.  The same standard could be applied to Wyland's music under the mysterious moniker, as well.  <em>Au</em> is both expansive and accessible enough that it leads listeners to take from it what they feel comfortable with, or to read themselves in his arrangements.  For a record so entranced with an <em>en plein air</em> approach to music making, it refreshingly offers the opportunity to leave a unique footprint.<br/></p></div>"|10383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10383-au/|7.7|Eric Harvey

    If you count the 2005 rarities comp <em>Catch that
    Totem!</em>, this is the fifth full-length by Alog, the Norwegian duo of Espen
    Sommer Eide and Dag-Are Haugan. Its title is apparently derived in part from
    the fact that many of the tracks were made using instruments neither
    member knows how to play. Such an approach by these two certainly makes sense.
    They are sound freaks, fascinated by the emotional potential of timbre, always
    searching for interesting things happening inside the hyphen that typically
    joins the words ""electro"" and ""acoustic"", so proper technique seems beside the point. When they are at
    their best, they make to my ears some of the most thrilling experimental music
    of this decade.</p><p>
    Alog albums have tended to feel like hodgepodges, where the best of what was left after a long period of tinkering was put together without much thought, but <em>Amateur </em>seems more cohesive thematically. They're making
    greater use of acoustic sounds here-- particularly a wide assortment of percussion,
    and also a good amount of guitar-- and a few more tracks than usual
    feature the human voice. Silence is also more of a presence, and the prevailing
    mood is low-key and reserved.</p><p>
    At one extreme on that score is the aptly titled ""Sleeping Instruments"". It's
    not completely without sound, but you'll need a low noise floor in your
    apartment to hear the tiny creaks and scrapes happening far away from the
    microphone. Or maybe that was just my ceiling fan. ""Exit Virtuoso"",
    ""A Throne for the Common Man"", and ""The Learning Curve"" all
    use gamelan percussion, and the latter two make use of various guitars as textural
    devices. ""The Future of Norwegian Wood"" captures what seems to be the
    groans of a tree branch being stressed by a couple on a rope swing mixed with
    electronic beeps and the rustling of unnamable bric-a-brac, until voices enter
    spitting out syllables halfway between a whisper and a chant.  
    </p>
<p>
    These are all tracks of interest, with lots of space
    around the sounds and plenty of time to soak everything in. But there's not
    much going on in terms of composition, no sense that each element is in its
    place for a compelling reason. In one sense there is something liberating about
    this quasi-random approach, in that the tracks seem malleable and open,
    basically tossing back to the listener whatever he or she puts in. Heard from
    another angle, these pieces can sound like raw material from a Matmos recording
    session, the scraps waiting to be hammered into shape by a record's
    overriding concept. 
    </p>
<p>
    So the tracks that hold up best to repeated listens are
    the ones heavier on electronics, the rude bits that don't quite seem to fit with
    what's going on around them. ""Bedlam Emblem"" is cranky and abrasive,
    lots of upper-mid electronic squeals surrounded by halos of static, and it
    clomps around in an unpredictable way but it also <em>builds</em>, gaining
    momentum as it presses forward. And ""The Beginner"", despite its
    marked similarity to ""St. Paul Sessions II"" from the band's 2005
    album <em>Miniatures</em>, manages to wring serious tension out of its unblinking
    repetition. <em>Amateur </em>is certainly a decent record, but those moments offering a glimpse at the breathtaking possibilities of pure sound, which made the
    last two Alog records so special, are sorely missed.

    You'll get along just fine with Brendan Hangauer. The
    frontman of Lawrence, Kan., septet Fourth of July, Hangauer knows what it's
    like to be an under-30, hopelessly romantic Midwestern kid who likes to
    party and address last night's regrets in fleet verses and big, grinning
    choruses lined with rock'n'roll guitars and handclap rhythms. After all,
    Hangauer is an under-30 white kid from the Midwest, and so-- on Fourth of July's endearing
    debut, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fourth of July on the Plains</span><span>-- that's
    exactly how he writes, sings and arranges. Even if you don't identify with his
    demographic or his particular plight-- trying to balance a long-distance
    romance and his own vices-- you'll likely understand the feelings
    they bring.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Hangauer's not a brainy writer, or at least that's what he
    wants you to think. He's fine settling for plainspoken aphorisms (""Goodbye's a
    hard word to use"" and ""Love can make you do some crazy things"") and lazy end rhyme
    (""Do I still want her? Now that I'm free/ Like a tree/ And my roots so deep""),
    writing afternoon-after songs about getting way too drunk and trying not to
    fall in love with girls he shouldn't go home with. Instead, he watches movies
    where the characters look like her and himself or locks himself in his house
    and drinks until he calls her in France and says stupid things. Maybe you've
    been this person?</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    His band's not brilliant, either: The drums are simple,
    steadfast rock beats; the bass lines are roots and steps; horns slice in and
    above the best anthems; the guitars are, at their most effective, simple and
    predictable. When they're not, they sound uncomfortable, like an inexperienced
    Nels Cline twisting his way through <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Kicking Television </span><span>without the tempering experience of Geraldine
    Fibbers. It's not a look Fourth of July wears well, so-- luckily-- they generally
    forego it. Rather, they do comfortable empathy the best, but they get away with
    twisting a lot of kinks into such simplicity. These are smartly arranged songs
    with multiple points of entry, fitting for a guy like Hangauer, who writes with
    ingenious wit and charm. Like, in ""Surfer Dude"", he imagines tracking his
    paramour to France, and finding her there, about to cheat. ""I watch him help
    you with your French/ As the season skips the spring."" There's the wink. ""And
    he whispers he can teach you how to surf."" The nod. ""And I yell, 'I know what
    that means.'"" And there's the massive headshake of anxiety. You know what he
    means, too, right? </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Some will lament that Fourth of July isn't as good as the
    Weakerthans, and they'll be completely right. As a band, the Weakerthans-- sharp,
    expert, taut-- tried things Fourth of July doesn't even aspire to with <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">On the
    Plains</span><span>. And, lyrically, Weakerthans'
    frontman John K. Samson flexed smarts Hangauer would say he doesn't even have (he'd
    be lying?). When Samson needed to excuse himself from an awkward social
    encounter on </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Reconstruction Site</span><span>,
    he explained his dogs needed to be fed before noting that his acquaintance
    looked like early 20th century explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Then</span><span> things got interesting. When Hangauer's agitated, he
    drinks, picks up the phone, or thinks about making love.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But it is worth noting that Hangauer gets something right
    that Samson-- unlike many of his sloppier peers-- nails, too. Like a keen,
    imaginative novelist or a fastidious journalist, Samson drops tiny narrative
    details in his best songs like signposts-- batteries stolen from fire alarms,
    darker grays breaking through lighter ones, the sight of nervous hands in tense
    conversations. Similarly, Hangauer is obsessed with weather and memories. He
    notes that he was only half a mile from his house when he made the decision to
    drink with strangers instead of make out with his girlfriend, and, when he
    professes that the telephone makes him feel less alone during ""She's in Love"",
    you listen to Hangauer apologize to her in France. ""Your dreams, they are more
    important than us,"" he sings, trapped in the melody and lying through his
    teeth. He's the same guy that notes the sun shines for her when she walks down
    the street or says that he can't cheat and claims that he'll help her move to
    New York when she's ready. Indeed, this Hangauer is a good guy. You'll get
    along just fine.

    It's going to take another few years, a lot of nostalgia, and even more critical evangelism for the Chemical Brothers to be recognized as one of the most all-around consistent acts of the 1990s. More than a decade after the release of their debut album, 1995's <em>Exit Planet Dust</em>, they remain inextricably tied to Big Beat electronica, a genre that had already fallen out of fashion by the time the tech bubble burst. Since most of America's hopes for so-called ""electronica"" were pinned on a cynically marketed next-big-thingism, its chart failure has tended to overshadow everything else-- including a fair critical appraisal, as Salon's Michelle Goldberg demonstrated in a pan of the Chemical Brothers' 2002 album <em>Come With Us</em>: ""Commercially, the mid-to-late-90s conceit that electronic music would wrest the airwaves from guitar rock dinosaurs has proved as fanciful as the idea that online video rental could be a billion-dollar business.""</p><p>
    You don't need to have the Chemicals' <em>Singles 93-03</em> video compilation in your Netflix queue to question the relevance of that statement: Electronica <em>was</em> a failure as a mass-culture lifestyle trend. But it was successful, too, in one important area: producing memorable pop records. Even in the post-crash doldrums of the early 2000s, the Chemical Brothers sustained their creative stride more effectively than most other artists clogging up the modern rock charts 30 notches above them. Albums like <em>Come With Us</em> and 2005's <em>Push the Button</em> were more pacekeepers than trendsetters, sure, but there was a cohesive freedom to them, a sort of universal dance music catchall vibe that cross-evolved through acid house, electro, hip-hop, and whatever else they could layer big, explosive bass over. Even as their returns began to diminish the further they got from the staggering peak of <em>Dig Your Own Hole</em>, the mild creative downturn wasn't significant enough to damage the overall feeling of optimistic, psychedelic egalitarianism embedded in their music.</p><p>
    This, though, this <em>We Are the Night</em>-- no, come on, not now. Not after Fatboy Slim's <em>Palookaville </em>and the Prodigy's <em>Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned</em> and Orbital's <em>The Blue Album</em> and Daft Punk's <em>Human After All</em> and the last two Moby records. Just because Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons are falling off the cliff a few years later than most of the other once-great hopes of 90s dance music doesn't make the plummet any less frustrating or embarrassing. Not even the low points on <em>Push the Button</em> suggested they were about to tank <em>this</em> hard.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    On <em>We Are the Night</em>, the Chemical Brothers have switched from integrators to imitators: Where 1999's <em>Surrender </em>opened with ""Music: Response"", expertly streamlining the cutting-edge electro-funk of early Timbaland, ""Do It Again"" sounds like a public domain version of a <em>FutureSex/LoveSounds</em> beat, with perky synths and an aloof radio-dance churn gutlessly approximating the elements that make those tracks work. Guest singer Ali Love turns in a mediocre Timberlake impression-- although even JT himself couldn't pull off a dippy couplet like ""got a brain like bubblegum/ Blowing up my cranium.""<br/>
</p>
<p>
    The album's title track attempts to weave the duo's euphoric buildups and breakdowns into warmed-over Krautrock, but with a beat that never crests, its dynamics are left to a weakly kitschy Perrey-Kingsley melody, damning the track to 6 1/2 minutes of a rickety retro-future parody of the 360-degree treadmill from <em>2001</em>. ""Das Speigel"" is an ill-advised stab at minimal house-- have the Chems ever even attempted to pull off minimal <em>anything</em>? -- and after layering on enough electronic giggles, squeals, melodicas, guitars, and extraneous sound effects to a briefly-promising groove, it turns out sounding like something from side 6 of Booka Shade's <em>Sandinista!</em>.</p><p>
    Other autopsies of this album might pin its weaker moments on the guest spots, but those mostly just make an already-bad situation moderately worse. ""All Rights Reversed"" would still sound like groggy emo if they got somebody besides the Klaxons to mutter close-harmony vocals over its inflated theatricality. It's probably for the best that ""Battle Scars"" wasn't given to a better singer than Willy Mason: His head-trauma Gordon Lightfoot vocals and the sub-Rod McKuen lyrics (""There's a line in the sand/ Put there by man/ By man whose children built up castles made of stone"") are perfectly suited to the track's tedious, xylophone-laden indie sleepwalk. And while there's been a well-earned avalanche of derision aimed at Fatlip's dopey nature-doc rap ""The Salmon Dance"", he had to work with the beat the Chemicals gave him; most MCs, faced with the prospect of rhyming over something Arthur Baker might have concocted after an afternoon of gorging on vanilla-frosted hash brownies and Spongebob reruns, would probably rap about dancing like a fish on crack, too.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    The Chemical Brothers' descent into ineptitude is at least accompanied by a few brief highlights: ""Saturate"" plays like one of <em>Surrender</em>'s<em> </em>acid house throwbacks, complete with Bill Ward-size drums, while ""A Modern Midnight Conversation""-- based on a whipcrack cowbell beat and the bassline from Crystal Grass' 1974 psych-disco classic ""Crystal World""-- is as euphoric as anything they've done this decade short of ""Star Guitar."" But those flashes of effortless dancefloor-filling greatness used to be the norm for the Chemical Brothers; as exceptions on an album of colossal blunders, they can only serve as fleeting reminders. I once found it hard to fathom that <em>Dig Your Own Hole</em> was released ten years ago; it's easier to believe now.<br/>

Blackshaw's fourth album </span><span>gracefully </span><span>glides over the same sonic ground that his contemporaries generally tread with reverential obedience or dilettante tactics. Growing into his prodigious own at the relatively young age of 25, Blackshaw </span><span>has finessed his 12-string acoustic guitar into a veritable solo symphony that's as schooled in </span><span>uncommon beauty as it is in </span><span>complex 20th century composition. But don't fear the esoterics: For everyone else, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic;"">The Cloud of Unknowing </span><span>is the gem no one expected to find. Blackshaw writes high drama into instrumental music with subtlety and charm, </span><span>speaking on sentiments and stories without requiring a single lyric (or, most of the time, any accompaniment at all).</span><span> A rare intersection of genre advancement and general accessibility, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic;"">The Cloud of Unknowing </span><span>is one of the true masterpieces of its own heralded realm.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The title <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic;"">The Cloud of Unknowing</span><span> is lifted from an anonymous 14th century text that articulated a mystical view of Christianity which asserts that God can be better met through a continuum of experience and love than through absolute knowledge. Fittingly, the five pieces here capitalize on dramatic push and pull, alternately joyous and foreboding 12-string figures that are constantly reabsorbed into a web of sheer movement and energy.</span> Despite his age, Blackshaw accomplishes this through profound musical erudition: Closer ""Stained Glass Windows"" nods to microtonality, climbing up and down an arch in the tiniest intervals, much like Rhys Chatham's gorgeous, glacial work with 400 electric guitars on <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic;"">A Crimson Grail</span><span>.</span><span>During ""The Mirror Speaks"", disparate melodies collide, interlock and crisscross, bending and pushing one another up or down. In his final years, Claude Debussy could pin such lines against one another with a piano in much the same way, but Blackshaw is an Englishman born nearly a decade after Bert Jansch left Pentangle and thriving in a time during which folk has found renewed currency. So here, he assimilates those past masters and, </span><span>prospering</span><span> from what he's learned from them,</span><span> laces one technique to another</span><span>.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Part of Blackshaw's success stems from his confidence. He's a beneficent host to one of the few non-technical ideals that united the great early minimalists: He fully inhabits an idea, allows it to build, and expires only when <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic;"">it </span><span>is ready. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic;"">The Cloud of Unknowing </span><span>opens and closes with 11 and 15 minutes pieces, yet these long forms are as approachable as the best four-minute pop songs. Their complex frames bear lucid motifs through brisk movement, guiding the listener through thousands of notes from 10 fingers and 12 strings with purpose.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Such perfect commitment is new to this album. Earlier non-guitar excursions embedded in Blackshaw's work felt slightly apologetic or indecisive. An excessive tampoura-and-cymbala drone overran the best bits of last year's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic;"">O True Believer</span><span>, and a disc-closing track with heavy percussion and organ provided a simple, sour end. Blackshaw was tempering his extremist tendencies then. On </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic;"">The Cloud</span><span>, though, Blackshaw seems fully settled, engaging his pieces and ideas with the unflinching belief of Tony Conrad in 1964 or Steve Reich in 1965. ""Running to the Ghost"" augments guitar with violin and glockenspiel, but those auxiliary parts are mere bells and strings highlighting how much sound Blackshaw can fit in one lithe motion. Indeed, it's his rumbling bass line (his tuning for this track </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic;"">starts </span><span>in B) supporting a nimble, mid-range melody and the strings that weave between its notes. The glockenspiel teases from above. The only non-guitar piece is a wandering four-minute electronic token. It's long enough to serve as an intermission but short enough to feel more like a pause than a distraction.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And that's a good thing. On an album where movement, experience, and persistence mean everything, it's best to let Blackshaw's 12-string momentum have as much space as it wants. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic;"">The Cloud of Unknowing </span><span>carves out a new, peerless space altogether-- one that puts Blackshaw at the top of his class.</span></p></div>"|10287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10287-the-cloud-of-unknowing/|8.7|Grayson Haver Currin

    In 1996, I saw Bruce Springsteen on the <em>Ghost of Tom Joad</em> Tour, when he took the stage for two hours with only an acoustic guitar and a harmonica. He was pretty good when the songs were fast-- I remember the lusty ""Red Headed Woman"" being a stand-out-- but whenever the tempos flagged, the show became deadly dull. When he interrupted the show to recount his favorite passage in <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>, I actually fell asleep-- despite being in the almighty presence of the man I considered at the time to be my hero. This is the Springsteen flip side that is rarely considered when artists from the Killers to the Arcade Fire cite him as an influence: There's anthemic Bruce of <em>Born to Run</em> and <em>Born in the U.S.A</em>, whose music seems to embody everything that rock and roll can and should be, but then there's serious storyteller Bruce of <em>The Ghost of Tom Joad</em> and <em>Devils &amp; Dust</em>, whose devotion to Steinbeck and Woody Guthrie is so personal that it often comes across as exclusionary.</p><p>
    While his colleagues go for the might and majesty of anthemic Bruce, Jon Berrnson is somewhat bolder: while he may not be directly citing the Boss as a source, his third album fronting Ray's Vast Basement seems squarely in the vein of <em>Tom Joad</em>, right down to its last period detail. <em>Starvation Under Orange Trees</em> was, according to the liners, inspired by Steinbeck's <em>Of Mice and Men</em> and commissioned by the Actors Theatre of San Francisco. This is a concept album as literary endeavor, which doesn't just mean the lyrics are smart, but rather that they evoke a time, place, and culture specifically and artfully. Fortunately, Berrnson doesn't try to retell that story through song, which would be largely unbearable. <em>Starvation</em> is not a piece of Dustbowl realism like Steinbeck's novel, nor Americana fantasia like HBO's defunct <em>Carnivále</em>-- nor, for that matter, anything resembling the AbEx of its curiously anachronistic cover. Instead, he and the band explore Depression culture on a larger scale: ""Work Song"" and ""California's Gone"" follow itinerants westward to labor in orange groves, and ""The Story of Lee"" recounts the trials of a Chinese immigrant. On the closing ""Annalisa"", a boxcar-jumper longs for the love he left behind, and the spirited ""Cotton Black"" is a boxing tale that could have been inspired by George Bellows' pugilist paintings.</p><p>
    With a large cast of musicians that includes Michael Zapruder and Decemberists bass player Nate Query, <span class=""postbody"">Bernson</span> anchors these songs in some of the same folk sounds that inspire storyteller Springsteen, but dresses them up in Sufjan-style orchestration. And yet, Berrnson actually incorporates very little period music into these songs, aside from scraps of ragtime on ""Danny's Party"" and blasts of trumpet on ""Cotton Black"". <em>Starvation</em> is overly modern, from the watery bossa nova beat of ""Palace Flophouse"" to the brushed snare on ""Ocean Notes"" that sounds like a loop. The trembling atmosphere of ""Work Song"" and ""Tall Bob Smoke"" are too cinematic, their gravity a kind of soundtrack shorthand that seems empty without a visual, but the backing vocals on ""The Story of Lee"" and ""Not Just Mine"" are mic'ed to sound like they're emanating either from a beat-up radio or from the firmament directly-- a nice atmospheric touch that suggests a dramatic chorus watching over these characters. <em>Starvation</em> achieves the brainy scope of a good novel, but to what end? Too firmly rooted in contemporary musical styles, none of these songs have much to say about the present-day. There's no activist spark here, just an academic scrutiny that rarely extends beyond the stage or the page.

    Ah, this is such stuff as beer commercials and Super Bowl ads are made on. Corn-fed Iowa blues-rock trio Radio Moscow have taken a number and are currently waiting in line at the revival deli, hoping today's special will be watered-down sports bar rock. Go ahead, try listening to the first 30 seconds of their self-titled debut without having a Pavlovian flashback to schlubby thirtysomethings high-fiving in a bar as girls in bikinis chug drinks and play touch-football on the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>
    It's a shame the band's sound elicits this sort of reaction. They're not a misogynistic or dim-witted collection of musicians; they just haven't considered the world outside the piles of guitar chord and scale charts that presumably consumed their youth. As a result of sheer serendipity, Black Keys member Dan Auerbach tucks these greenhorns under his wing, offering to produce their debut after frontman Parker Griggs gave him the band's demo at a Keys show. Unfortunately, Auerbach's not exactly the alchemist to transmute these lumps of lead into gold, especially after his own band's lackluster 2006 album, <em>Magic Potion</em>.</p><p>
    This album's most distinguishing characteristic is easily how indistinguishable these songs are from each other. Several of them sound like they're named after touristy Southern bars (""Lickskillet"", ""Luckydutch"", ""Mistreating Queen"") and all of them feel content with burying Briggs' already muffled vocals in wah-wah guitars and gratuitous mid-song jams. There's only one change-of-pace number on the album, the Far East-tapping ""Ordovician Fauna"", though even that track merely swaps boring pentatonic riffs for boring Indian scale riffs.</p><p>
    Some areas where the band could really rally around: ""Timebomb"" has a decent melody, and for the split-second of the chorus where Briggs jumps up an octave to deliver a lovelorn yelp, you feel like the song's actually building towards something. Then poof-- a non-descript lick takes over, the pounding, staccato rhythm  sections melts into predictable downbeat flab, and Radio Moscow attempt to once again try blowing your mind with a garden variety ""jam."" The chic criticisms of Cream/Led Zep/Hendrix thievery don't even apply to these classic rock throwbacks-- the band's not swiping full-fledged ideas from anyone. They're barely recreating anything more complicated than atonal finger exercises, a drawback that ultimately makes this debut such a bitch slap to the face of the musical genre that helped proliferate words like ""hook"" and ""riff"" in our lexicon.

    Underground ""supergroups"" aren't necessarily less superfluous or embarrassing than the major-label
    dinosaurs who started the trend, but one still hopes that when unsung artists unite under a
    common creative spark it's for the sake of the art. Tomahawk have managed
    to sound like less than the sum of their parts for two records now,
    but this time, they've come together for to flesh out a nobler and
    more artistic concept. They're now a three-piece featuring Duane
    Dension, guitarist of Jesus Lizard, John Stanier, drummer of Helmet
    and the justly-hyped Battles, and vocalist and chronic collaborator
    Mike Patton, who this website alone has called ""an icon,""  a
    ""psychotic misanthrope,"" ""the Devil on holiday,"" a
    ""greasy-ass on of a bitch,"" and ""King Shit of Fuck Mountain."" (What's become of
    Melvins' Kevin Rutmanis, formerly on bass, is a mystery). The
    curveball: Rather than the predictable freak-metal they've pursued on
    their previous albums, <em>Anonymous</em> takes the band
    name to heart and interprets Native American compositions, researched
    by Denison while touring reservations with Hank Williams III. And here I thought Patton had run
    out of ways to alienate people and limit his own appeal.</p><p>
    What's it sound like? A lot like
    two talented musicians pushing themselves to find new contexts for
    Patton to grunt over.  Dension plays it straight for the most part,
    playing slow and woozy clean guitar lines on tracks like ""Ghost
    Dance"" and ""Cradle Song"", rooting us in the familiar and
    evoking the creepier quiet moments of Jesus Lizard songs where
    listeners patiently waited to get their asses kicked, and the
    occasional hyper-compressed power-chord thud to keep it lively.
    Patton is listed as doing some percussion, but the burden of
    authenticity falls upon Stanier, who's got to not only mimic the
    backbeat of an entire culture's music, but to add new textures and be
    the group's historical anchor while still driving the more metal and
    industrial moments. One listen to ""Mescal Rite 1"" proves he can
    do all of it ably, even if Patton's contributions make or break the
    directions each composition takes. The calmer moments of the album
    can sound like a window into a past ritual, as it does on the
    surprisingly subtle ""Ghost Dance"", or with his diverse delivery
    on the downright perky ""Antelope Ceremony"". Elsewhere, it sounds
    like an alternate soundtrack to <em>Poltergeist 2</em> with
    the hammy keyboards and self-consciously spooky chanting of ""War
    Song"" or the collision of  flutes and lazer noises in ""Mescal
    Rite 1"". And then sometimes, it sounds like Massive Attack (""Mescal
    Rite 2"").</p><p>
    To the band's credit, even the
    cheesiest songs show genuine respect for the originals, as they play
    these rhythms and themes without any watering-down or Westernization.
    Good idea or not, it's hardly a caricature. On top of that, it's an
    immersive listen that undoubtedly creates an atmosphere; only on the
    seventh track ""Song of Victory"" do they even begin to sound like
    a live band and not as if they're scoring a movie. <em>Anonymous</em>
    does show more potential for Tomahawk and justifies their existence
    beyond the mere gimmick of a supergroup, but how many listeners this
    odd, headstrong little record will reach is difficult to picture.

His lyrics have lots of room for a singer to find a personal angle, and their melodies are durable enough to sound just fine no matter how far they're pushed-- the farther the better, really. ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall"", which led off Bryan Ferry's 1974 solo debut <em>These Foolish Things</em>, is one of the most awesome Dylan covers ever, the kind of interpretation that leaves its source bruised, hung over and covered in Sharpied taunts. Ferry ripped apart Dylan's apocalyptic tapestry fiber by fiber and reconstructed it in Day-Glo plastic thread; his performance's deliberately affected mannerisms seem to have made an enduring impact on the young David Byrne.</p><p>
    Ferry's returned to the Dylan songbook a few times since then, including two tracks on 2002's <em>Frantic</em>, and the marketing hook for his tedious new record is that it's all Bob: 10 covers of the master, plus ""Baby, Let Me Follow You Down"", an oldie that Dylan learned from Eric von Schmidt. The chief joke of the album is that <em>Dylanesque</em> isn't particularly Dylanesque, aside from a couple of harmonica solos plunked in for symbolic purposes. Anything resembling a rough edge in the arrangements has been buffed away; Dylan's wicked vocal backspin has been replaced by Ferry's touch-my-velvet-dinner-jacket-baby default croon, sometimes backed up by characterless backup chicks. A Dylanesque choice of repertoire would've been perverse and deep-diving, maybe borderline inscrutable, but Ferry sticks to the hits.</p><p>
    He also hermetically seals the hits off from meaning. Ferry can be a subtle ironist when he feels like it--he's made a career out of blurring the line between romantic and ""romantic""-- so maybe it's another joke that he treats the opening song here, the despondent ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"", as if it were just an assemblage of syllables and notes like anything else he could rubber-stamp the ""Bryan Ferry"" brand onto. But compared to, say, Nina Simone's blood-in-the-bathwater rendition of the same song, it just seems lazy.</p><p>
    When he recycles the same blasé, prefabricated technique for virtually every other song here, it's not just lazy-- it's infuriating. The band isn't much help, either: They play polite, foursquare rock with the occasional ""tasty"" lick at the end of a line. ""All Along the Watchtower"" lifts the Jimi Hendrix arrangement, just like the version Dylan plays on stage almost every night, but Ferry and company amble through it as if its central line is ""no reason to get excited.""</p><p>
    There's something in Dylan that Ferry is attached to, obviously, but it's not clear what. He's talked about how interpreting these songs is like reading Shakespeare. That's true, in a way; bad actors perform Shakespeare as if the text were a jeweler's pillow to display their star presence to best advantage, and that's the way Ferry mostly sings Dylan now. He doesn't really address the songs on their own terms, or even wrestle with them the way he did with ""Hard Rain"". He just runs them through the Ferry-izer, treating them all like they're ""Slave to Love"". Which means that, as much as he tries to capitalize on his voice's suaveness and seductiveness and hauntingness, he can't sing ""All I Really Want to Do"" as suavely as the Byrds, or ""If Not For You"" as seductively as Olivia Newton-John (no, seriously!), or ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" as hauntingly as just about anyone else who's ever attempted it.</p><p>
    There's only one glimmer here of Ferry's old interpretive wit. He murmurs ""Positively 4th Street"" in a gently mournful tone, backed up by power-ballad piano and whooshing movie-soundtrack synthesizers. The song is one of the most vindictive, venomous kiss-offs Dylan's ever written; gentle mournfulness wouldn't seem to suit it. But Ferry phrases it as a regretful glance back at a relationship that somehow didn't work out, and keeps a straight face all the way up to the last line, ""you'd know what a drag it is to see you""-- whereupon he gives ""drag"" the bitter snap he's been saving up. Thanks, Bryan; the feeling is mutual.</p></div>"|10375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10375-dylanesque/|1.9|Douglas Wolk

    Bowerbirds' accordionist Beth Tacular paints-- sometimes on paper, sometimes on craggy bits of salvaged wood-- strange, whimsical landscapes, littered with critters and berries and plants and airplanes and skyscrapers and unicorns and feathers. Tacular's visual art (already beloved by plenty) is packed with big, gnawing oppositions-- industry vs. ecology, urban vs. rural, fantasy vs. truth, man vs. earth-- and Bowerbirds' tingly indie-folk is no less dynamic or indicting.</p><p>
    Tacular, along with partner/guitarist Phil Moore and multi-instrumentalist and producer Mark Paulson, churns out deceptively pleasing folksongs about plants and animals and the unforgivable things we do to them. Even in a post-Al Gore America (where Wal-Mart's gone green-- sorta-- and hybrid cars are as much of an it-accessory as Goyard totes), it's still awfully hard for a sweet-faced North Carolina couple to clutch their instruments to their chests and coo bits like, ""It takes a lot of nerve to destroy this wondrous earth"" without making everyone squirmy. But Bowerbirds' pro-Earth proselytizing is more endearing (and inspiring) than precious or cloying, and if anything, all that earnestness will just make you adore them more (and, maybe, think a little bit harder about the interstates slicing up your hometown forests).</p><p>
    Snatching their name from an Australian chirper (bowerbirds are most famous for the inverse relationship between a male's plumage and its ability to construct a mate-attracting nest), Bowerbirds' debut long player (released by Pitchfork writer Grayson Currin's label) will likely garner loads of comparisons to Devendra Banhart and Vetiver, but their brand of folk is more Appalachian than British (Carter Family over Bert Jansch), and less concerned with psychedelia than melody (think gypsy-influenced Sufjan Stevens). Opener ""Hooves"" starts small and modest, with Moore mewing about his mom over spare acoustic guitar (""Back when I was born on a full moon/ I nearly split my momma in two""), before the vocals double, drums kick up, and Tacular's accordion starts to whine: the track is somehow quiet and jarring at the same time, and invites all kinds of twee analogies (a family of deer darting through a clearing! Thunderclaps at night! Rainbows!).</p><p>
    ""In Our Talons"" is equally mesmerizing, jazzy and rich, with lyrics both gentle and barbed (""We're only human/ This at least we've learned""), while ""The Marbled Godwit"" is Bowerbirds' most classically freak-folk moment (and most Newsom-inspired title?), with acoustic guitar, high, meandering vocals, and cutting violin. Hymns strongest tracks-- ""Slow Down"", ""In Our Talons"", ""Dark Horse""-- manage to be both hypnotically pretty and a little bit weird, characteristics of the very best kind of Americana music. Bowerbirds do for backyards what the Hold Steady's done for parking lots-- translated place into sound.

The title of their 1999 breakthrough  <em>The Man Who</em> is a nod to neurologist Oliver Sachs' noted 1986 book of patient case studies, and its 2001 follow-up <em>The Invisible Band</em> a twist on ""invisible hand,"" Adam Smith's economic theory of self-interest being good for the whole.  Continuing that trend is the best moment on <em>The Boy With No Name</em>, ""Selfish Jean"", a pun on biologist Richard Dawkins' hugely successful book <em>The Selfish Gene</em>.  The song's lyrics are, quite literally, nothing new; they're lifted in large part from the band's decade-old B-side ""Standing on My Own"".  The instrumentation, however, is what sticks around: Partly drawn from fellow Glaswegian Stuart Murdoch's pop-soul, but merged with a soft take on ""Lust for Life""'s rhythm track, it's the most refreshing song the band's made in quite some time.</p><p>
<em>Boy</em>'s title, however, hides no such wordplay-- quite the opposite, really-- as it came from singer Fran Healy's inability to settle on a name for his recently born son, and much of the album deals with the intricacies of family life, good and bad.  First single ""Closer"", extended-metaphor number ""Battleships"" (""we're battleships, driftin' in an alley river""), and ""My Eyes"" are delicate, chiming recollections of a troubled, nearly severed relationship.  Fittingly, they sound like bombast-free Coldplay as well, but that, of course, isn't Travis' fault.  Their last effort, 2003's Godrich-free <em>12 Memories</em>, came after Chris Martin and co. had appropriated their gentle angst and transformed it into stadium-size sentimentality, and the record unwisely attempted to channel Blair-era political venom.  Four years later, <em>Boy</em> feels like a return to form-of sorts. While it's far from great, and won't come close to flaring up another UK pop revolution, <em>Boy</em>'s got more than a few moments that recall <em>Invisible</em>, their highly enjoyable, feather-light post-platinum record, and the most fitting direction for the group after the success of what <em>NME</em> referred to as their ""sad, classic record"".</p><p>
    Most importantly for all involved, <em>Boy</em> marks the return of Godrich, and his studio sensibilities are now clearly recognizable as second only to Healy's songwriting in terms of indispensibility. ""Big Chair"" skitters along on a syncopated drum patter that recalls Radiohead's ""There There"", as Healy's wide melisma glides atop, and ""Eyes Wide Open"" moves from a tightly-wound stomp to an emotionally and sonically spacious chorus, with multiply layered, echo-laden guitars providing support.  To the group's credit, <em>Boy</em>'s best songs-- all contained within the first 2/3 of the record-- manage to regain a degree of (and gently tweak) their <em>Invisible</em> mojo, without resorting to pulling ideas from their own pupils.  While the first half of the record is promising, however, the band loses steam toward the end, with ""One Night"" and ""Out in Space"" are Travis on auto-pilot, and closing New York ode ""New Amsterdam"" is just <em>too</em> affected to be effective.  While more albums like <em>Boy</em> will probably mean that the anonymity of Travis' album titles will turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, variations on the most prominent themes re-established here certainly feel like the proper moniker for the band to adopt.<br/></p></div>"|10367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10367-the-boy-with-no-name/|5.6|Eric Harvey

    If there exists a group able to make music as sour-sounding as Tarwater, I'd
    like to hear it. On second thought, maybe I wouldn't. <em>Spider Smile</em>,
    Berliners Bernd Jestram and Ronald Lippok's eighth album under the moniker and
    second for hometown imprint Morr Music, marks a decade of the duo finding ways
    to further tweak their long-tweaked formula of blending electronic textures and
    a variety of oft-exotic instrumentation, with all manner of astringent sonics
    located in the crowded overlap.</p><p>
<em>Spider</em> shows Jestram and Lippok's continued ability to implement a
    wide array of noisemakers-- many seeming electronic simulations of real
    instruments-- into their acidic mélange. Opener ""Shirley Temple""
    showcases a nauseated synthesized harpsichord, ""Sweet Home Under White
    Clouds"" features the ethereal whine of what sounds like a musical saw, and
    the soft honk of an oboe colors ""Roderick Usher"". The album's best
    moment, the instrumental ""Witch Park"", is a clanky contraption of
    welded-together scraps; farting synth notes, a slowly dying harmonica and a
    tabla form a thrumming neo-Krautrock engine held together by a droning
    electronic wheeze. Even the more traditional utensils, like the pair's
    omnipresent acoustic guitars, are tapped and twisted to elicit their
    peculiarities: on ""The World of Things to Touch"", the sound of
    fingers sliding up and down metal strings is spotlighted, to unnerving effect.</p><p>
    The most evocative elements in the pair's instantly recognizable admixture,
    however, are still the lyrics and vocal delivery. In a pallid timbre evoking a
    warmer version of Kraftwerk's on <em>The Man Machine</em>, Lippok continues to
    provide emotionally distant-- and, to a large degree, distancing-- comment,
    often in stark contrast to the comparatively vivid backdrops. <em>Spider</em>'s
    cover image shows an in-ground pool and umbrella in otherwise colorless
    surroundings, and its lyrics follow suit. These items encompass, in a manner
    seemingly known only to these two diffident Germans, various aspects of
    American society, mostly of the high variety, decontextualized and abstracted.
    Edgar Allan Poe's vision of decadent isolation is the inspiration for the
    plaintive instrumental ""Usher"", while the above-mentioned
    instrumental ""Shirley Temple"" couples with the elegant ""When
    Love was the Law in Los Angeles"" to construct a trans-Atlantic Hollywood
    pastiche. ""Los Angeles"" is particularly memorable for being the most
    upbeat track on the record-- the acoustic pluck and click and light organ
    flourish sound almost nostalgic for the Golden Age, especially when paired with
    the lyric ""the boy in the cage set the world on fire.""
    </p>
<p>
    As Jestram and Lippok's abstractions become more topical, they
    simultaneously become less meaningful. The new-age-leaning ""A Marriage in
    Belmont"" takes a musty view of American popular entertainment as endorsed
    voyeurism (""Darling, there are you and I, making love in a glass box""
    and ""We found ourselves alone and voiceless in the fire""). Similarly,
    ""Easy Sermon"" takes the simple path toward comment on organized religion,
    doing its own proselytizing along the way: ""A message will come to the
    deaf and the dumb, in an easygoing way."" The slippage between icy
    observations and straight sermonizing is an easy indulgence, but it's the sort
    of tartness that Tarwater would do well to avoid altogether.

    Drawing Voices is a collaboration between meta-A/V artist Craig Dongoski and
    Aaron Turner from Isis. To say more than this at the outset is to say too much,
    because there are two distinct ways to engage with this album, and the
    encounter is richer if one experiences both. Readers who wish to do so are
    advised to familiarize themselves with the music before reading this review. Go
    ahead, we'll wait.</p><p>
    Everyone back? Okay. With no knowledge of its conceptual underpinnings, <em>Drawing
    Voices</em> is a decent drone-based record. Nothing on it would surprise anyone
    who has a couple Growing, Excepter, or Sightings albums in their collection:
    Wispy modulating waveforms, crystal beds of rhythm, and Turner's processed
    guitar noodlings-- featured most prominently on the sinuous ""The Shrine of
    Wreckless Illumination""-- play out in long, palsied arcs. ""Being Born
    Broken"" consists of little more than a pixilated drone and the overdriven
    noises that sporadically attack it, while ""Scattered Shavings"" pits
    batty squeaks against choral vacuum-cleanerish roars. The chattering, richly
    textured ""Being Born Broken II"" is a lot like Maja Ratjke's voice
    manipulation experiments, and ""A Choir Speaks"" is a sound-effect
    corrosion bath, not dissimilar to Svarte Greiner's indirectly representational
    compositions.</p><p>
    While <em>Drawing Voices</em> is not entirely satisfying <em>qua</em> drone,
    there's something naggingly compelling about it. Its rudimentary palette and
    its peculiar habit of abrupt, volume-jacked punch-ins-- one moment, you're
    hearing a regressive hum, the very next, all your EQ levels are in the red--
    allude to some sort of hidden guide rail or internalized policy. And so it is: <em>Drawing
    Voices</em> turns out to be heavily process-based; listening conceptually is the
    second (and preferred) way to approach it. 
    </p>
<p>
    Dongoski's process involves recording the sounds of ""mark-making""
    (the aural environment produced by the act of drawing) and manipulating the
    results into compositional foundations. In doing so, he mines the rich
    techno-organic seam between the intimately human act of drawing and the stoic
    precision of mechanical intervention, and articulates one of the many shadow
    narratives latent in illustration, effectively translating discrete visual
    units into their inextricable but wildly capricious sonic analogues. Knowing
    that Dongoski's sounds are the emulsion of a traditionally visual act brings
    the album to life. 
    </p>
<p>
    To an extent, process-based art confounds popular criticism. This is
    especially true of processes like Dongoski's, which exploit areas of slippage
    between two distinct acts, bringing forces both aleatoric and conceptually
    predetermined into play. The spontaneous and unconstrained creative act
    proceeds by a series of decisions, providing numerous opportunities to ""go
    wrong"" (armor-chinks for critical arrows) along the way; process-based
    creation begins with one major conceptual decision and then plays out according
    to the terms of its particular game. 
    </p>
<p>
    As such, the finished product of such a process takes on a secondary
    importance to the unquantifiable relationships between the product, its mode of
    production, and the conceptual leap that spawned it. In such a case, whether or
    not we (or the artist, for that matter) like or dislike the finished product
    becomes almost moot: It is, quite literally, what it is, and must be contended
    with on that level. Of course, none of this will interest listeners who engage
    with music strictly on the level of sound-- this album is not for them. But
    those attuned to the drastically particular mindset of process-based creation,
    with its minimization of the creative will and Russian-doll-caliber relational
    depth, will find Dognoski's curious alchemy worthwhile.

    As I'm sure is true of 90% of Pitchfork's readership, I have no epochal stories where my mind gets blown apart at an 80s Bad Brains show-- although I did have a couple of permanent teeth knocked out when I finally heard the band's 1982's self-titled ""yellow tape,"" with songs like ""Sailing On"" and ""Banned in D.C."" positively shredding all advance hype. Unlike the uglier, post-grindcore 90s hardcore I was devouring at the time, there was a clean, hooky quality to Bad Brains' tumult, and though I didn't know it then, the jazz fusion they'd burned through as apprentices in the Chocolate City scene allowed their music to turn at subconsciously funky angles that would have sent most of their peers scrambling for Dramamine. And yes, that they were African-Americans still matters, as should be obvious to anyone who's disconcertingly watched the pasty wave of bobbing heads at a punk show, whether in 1977 or 2007.</p><p>
    With that tape as the formalist high point of early hardcore, even Bad Brains themselves had to branch sideways instead of taking us higher, with more gloss and more metal on subsequent LPs. Following the release of 1983's <em>Rock for Light,</em> they would be plagued by legal troubles, break-ups, reformations, and perhaps most humiliatingly, briefly losing the rights to their own damn band name. But even when the reunion albums flopped or singer H.R. ran embarrassingly afoul of the law, we always had the earlier records. The 1996 CD reissue of the yellow tape came with a quote where Adam Yauch of Beastie Boys messed himself over its life-changing qualities, and that überfan status might be part of why he was drafted to record the band's first real comeback album under its true name since 1995's forgettable <em>God of Love</em>. <em>Build a Nation</em> is neither the equal of those first three Bad Brains albums, nor as disappointing as the string that followed. It is, however, an awesome, if intermittently frustrating, release from a band whose musicians, singer, and producer often seem at cross purposes.</p><p>
    Age hasn't slowed the band by much, but they've spread out, with <em>Build a Nation</em> picking up where the lowdown, growling grooves of 1986's metallic crossover classic <em>I Against I</em> left off. Bad Brains' twentysomething thrashing-- where they blasted with a fluidity that took your breath away but never sacrificed hardcore's brutish bump-- is still more convincing to my aging punk rocker's ears as the band approaches middle age, at least more so than the mid-tempo, circle pit-friendly material they helped to invent with ""Re-Ignition"". 
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, pioneer status doesn't mean you can't fall prey to blandness, but virtuosity can still get you pretty far when wedded to ballpeen brutality. So at the same time as <em>Build a Nation</em> tracks like ""Pure Love"" and ""Let There Be Angels (Just Like You)"" will win out for fans of the blistering ROIR tape over crunchy headbangers like ""Jah People Make the World Go Round"", Dr. Know's scouring-pad guitar leads (check the opening of ""Universal Peace"" or the breakdown in ""Send You No More Flowers"") still slay 90% of hardcore axe men, and the band's bass sound remains a thrilling drag-strip roar that's been molded into a fluid, jazzy funk-plunk. Plus, the band's reggae is more fully-assed here-- catchy, even-- with the sheet metal dub effects on ""Natty Dreadlocks 'Pon the Mountaintop"" ditching the ersatz quality that often marred their roots. </p><p>
    Credit for the sonic brawn has to go in part to producer Yauch, but some of his other studio decisions are a bit more suspect. What torpedoes <em>Build a Nation</em> is the heavy cream of reverb and echo that drowns the vocals-- an especially heinous decision from a producer for whom words are such an important part of his day job, and for a band whose frontman once channeled as much runaway abandon as the guitar or rhythm section. H.R. flits on <em>Build a Nation</em> between two modes-- a gnarled sort of Rasta-Yoda delivering fragmented chant-raps, and that classic Valley skater sneer that bequeathed such helpful concepts to punk as the positive mental attitude and the need to hunt vampires-- but too often he's reverbed into an apparition floating through his bandmates' demolition. Perhaps that's not such a bad thing given that lyrically he's either been spinning his ""one love"" wheels or taking Rasta's homophobic/gynophobic shtick a little too literally since the late 80s, but nonetheless a shame for fans of kineticism. Who's to say whether or not this decision to diffuse the Brains' most distinctive instrument in a smothering layer of distracting effects was a conscious move or a failure of nerve on the part of the singer, producer, or both. It would have been nice if a little more of that classic back-flipping, elbow-throwing energy made it onto the disc.

    Almost as if by accident, Victoria Bergsman's aching voice
    has become one of the most widely known in indie pop. As primary singer and
    songwriter for Swedish pop outfit the Concretes until last summer, Bergsman
    featured on at least one remarkable album, 2004's <em>The Concretes</em>. But it was a Target commercial that seared the
    Ronettes-via-Velvets swoon of the Concretes' ""Say Something New"" onto
    TV viewers' consciousnesses. By now, the songstress might be best recognized for her
    guest appearance on Peter Bjorn &amp; John's world-conquering 2006 single
    ""Young Folks"".</p><p>
    Bergsman's debut under the solo moniker Taken By Trees is
    her most consistently winning full-length since the Concretes peaked. But if <em>Open Field</em> leads to any similar
    mainstream flings, they'll still feel like fortunate flukes. Co-produced with
    PB&amp;J's Björn Yttling, the album exists in its own ecstatically melancholy
    pre-dawn realm, at once less crowded and more lushly imagined than Bergsman's
    previous outings. It's personal, introspective folk-pop with the instrumental
    palette of a girl-group teenage symphony-- zithers, euphoniums, mandolins,
    and harmoniums along with flutes and a string section. Think <em>Pink Moon</em> on a ""Be My Baby""
    scale.</p><p>
    For all the richness of the orchestration, the songs at any
    given moment tend to be mostly spare, offbeat, and repetitive, the intermittent
    violin and cello crests merely making more space for Bergsman's lonely
    yearning. One-finger piano plonks bring the
    singer closer to a distant, kindred spirit on ""Julia"" (""We
    rarely speak, but I do think of you a lot""). A child could also play the piano
    part on sing-songy call-and-response ""Hours Pass Like Centuries"", but the
    contrast with PB&amp;J's John Eriksson's majestic percussion helps convey the
    way love can ""Leave you singing to the trees/ Then return so
    suddenly"". An untreated acoustic guitar on marvelously sad opener ""Tell
    Me"" sounds like it could be in the room with us. ""I don't have much trust in
    the April sun,"" Bergsman sighs, and turns the Swedish pronunciation of
    ""July"" into a bleak pun.
    </p>
<p>
    Crucially, the arrangements are never busy enough to
    overshadow Bergsman's unmistakable vocals. As cymbals swell and strings drone
    over ""The Legend"", there she is, cooing and crying and stretching her
    syllables in that distant, nearly Nico-like accent, describing a loveless woman
    who, as if she were a Gabriel García Márquez character, becomes transformed into water-- ""Or maybe blood/ Without its red."" Within the quiet
    longing of ""Too Young"", it can be overwhelming to notice the way
    Bergsman's voice quivers on the word ""fear"", or her pealing
    matter-of-factness on the phrase, ""It was not for me."" A delicate piano passage grows out
    of the sadness like May flowers.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Open Field</em>'s many
    subtleties mean it can't be enjoyed just anytime; it practically demands
    solitude. The tracks work as mood pieces as well as songs, and the mood is so
    consistent that it takes time for the craft of each composition to peer
    through, a silver lining on a gray morning. The best place to start is probably
    the only song not written or co-written by Bergsman: The album's first video
    selection, ""<strong><a href=""http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/43652-taken-by-trees-former-concretes-singer-victoria-bergsman-lost-and-found"">Lost and Found</a></strong>"". With some of the most constantly full
    production here, it's a lilting chamber-pop gem worthy of its composer, Camera
    Obscura's Tracyanne Campbell. Then again, another highlight is Yttling's matter-of-factly named ""Instrumental""-- an orchestral reminder that, as lovely as
    Bergsman's voice is, it's only one of several reasons to adore her newest

    In the liner photos for the Detroit Cobras' fourth album, <em>Tied &amp; True</em>,
    singer Rachel Nagy is always pictured with a half-smoked cigarette extending
    from between her index and middle fingers, which in this context carries as
    much cultural import as peroxide hair, Tura Satana measurements, and a crate
    full of girl-group 45s. In addition to ostensibly producing the delectable rasp
    in Nagy's vocals, each butt symbolizes the Cobras' debt to a very specific
    brand of juvenile delinquent cool that favors leather jackets and tender
    hearts, raw guitars and boozy beats. Formed guess where in 1995, the Cobras
    managed to survive that postmillennial garage rock thing on Sympathy for the
    Record Industry before signing to Bloodshot for their 2005 album, <em>Baby</em>,
    which was produced by fellow Detroit scenester Jack White. For their follow-up,
    Nagy and guitarist Mary Ramirez take over production (along with John Smereck)
    and bring in Reigning Sound's Greg Cartwright to beef up their guitar assault.
    Tossing off tracks like they're flicking dead butts onto asphalt, the Cobras
    sound reinvigorated, playing up their own feminine smarts and rock-and-roll
    insouciance that you just know sounds better live.</p><p>
<em>Tied &amp; True</em> suggests the Cobras have become one of the best cover
    bands around, with better chops and material than their competitors. To their
    considerable credit, they see no distinction on this album between blues,
    rockabilly, country, garage rock, soul, r&amp;b, and girl-group pop, and so are
    free to mix everything together at will. After leading off with a fiery version
    of Garnett Mims' ""As Long as I Have You"", they pick the pockets of
    Irma Thomas, Bettye Lavette, the Cookies, the Flirtations, and the Equals, to
    name a few. Despite the pervasive smoking ban afflicting venues across the
    nation, the Cobras insist that their hard-living influences are timeless and
    trendless, and their understanding of how audiences first connected with these
    songs prevents the band from succumbing to joy-killing record-collection rock.</p><p>
<em>Tied &amp; True </em>primarily emphasizes the band's range through
    gender-switched covers. Sure, you don't even have to change the pronouns on
    songs like James Brown's ""If You Don't Think"" and Leadbelly's
    ""On a Monday"" to feminize them, but Little Willie John's ""Leave
    My Kitten Alone"" takes on a slightly new meaning delivered in Nagy's
    nicotine voice and with the band meowing in the background. Instead of the
    typical scenario of a man defending his woman against leering eyes, their
    version recasts the sexes and sexualities, opening the song up to new and more
    volatile readings. Fortunately, the Cobras don't have an academic mission on <em>Tied
    &amp; True</em>; in fact, they'd probably scoff at such a deep reading. For them
    a cigarette is just a cigarette.

    In
    listening to <em>The Flowers of Hell</em>,
    the debut LP from the highly touted London octet of the same name, the obvious
    criticism is the band's lack of tension and release. Indeed, for a band so
    indebted to Spacemen 3/Spiritualized glory (Sonic Boom produced pieces of the
    album and plays guitar on one track), a remarkable chunk of the record is spent
    watching pretty textures billow and breathe, letting them work more toward a
    background ambiance than a narrative thrust. But the Flowers of Hell actually
    pair a perfect amount of release to their tension: they're less like a rubber
    band, stretched and waiting to be cut or shot, and more like a piece of thick
    string, pulled for a bit until the only thing left to do is put it down and
    move along.</p><p>
    ""Sympathy
    for Vengeance"", for instance, marches triumphantly for three minutes
    before slowly settling into a halcyon downslope, interrupted three minutes
    later by an attempt at a BIG ROCK CLIMAX! The idea is there, but the music
    itself plays out like an art student trying to pass off an oil painting as a
    bas-relief sculpture, with drums that are too staid, guitars that aren't trying
    to beat themselves, and sounds too timid to saturate. Or there's ""Foreign
    Lands"", a stock psychedelic drone for viola, reversed long-tones, Indian
    percussion, and the sort of twisting, slow, mid-range riffs that have become a
    signifier for ""out rock."" If it were capable of offering suspense or
    relief, its tonal banality would be forgivable. But, like much of the album
    (N.B. ""Through the F Hole"" and ""A Moment in Time""), it's
    not.</p><p>
    The
    Flowers' chief referent was capable of using expected sounds for unexpected
    drama: At their best, Spiritualized had the capacity to build
    ""pretty"" alongside ""ugly"" and let the results battle it out
    in front of a microphone. It's not that the Flowers of Hell don't have the muscle or smarts to match the climb and collapse that made their predecessors captivating. They do: On
    ""Compound Fractures"", the band briefly comes together in a moment of
    cathartic cacophony. They pit a singing saw against a deep, dark piano, martial
    tom rolls, and a menacing viola, deftly letting their brood glow with a
    sinister pallor. During ""Opt Out"", paired passages juxtapose a
    weeping refrain from that same viola with the just-about-to-triumph coruscation
    of a cornet, setting the scene for theatrics that are never realized across the
    track's dawdling 14 minutes. Even when the Flowers mount momentum that they
    later crumble, the best you get are slightly louder, faster drums and a few
    more piggybacked textures. They're never able to commit-- or, properly, <em>over</em>commit-- to flexing inside of their
    ideas. It feels more like living life as a moviegoer and less like a zealot
    (Spiritualized), superhero (Mogwai) or rebel (Godspeed You! Black Emperor). 
    </p>
<p>
    But
    maybe that's how this band wants it, to let subtlety reign in understated
    anthems that gather the reflected light (if not spirit) of Brian Eno's rock
    records, the Velvet Underground's trapped-inside-a-chord swirls, and space
    rock's ecclesiastical reign. Graceful closer ""Telescopic Suite"" nails
    that feeling. It's just that if you're coming to the Flowers of Hell looking
    for anything more than slightly dynamic background music in the hands of
    composers and players ostensibly capable of giving it to you, you're going to
    be let down. Wait, that's not right: You'll never actually be picked up.

    Miami's DJ Khaled doesn't really do much. He doesn't rap. He doesn't sing.
    He doesn't cut or scratch. He <em>does</em> produce tracks under his Beat
    Novocain alias, but not that often; he's responsible for only two of the tracks
    on <em>We the Best</em>, his sophomore album. Mostly, he just incessantly screams
    dumb catchphrases, and he doesn't even do <em>that</em> particularly well; one of
    the reasons that Lil Wayne and Khaled's <em>Da Drought 3</em> is the best mixtape
    in years is Lil Wayne's decision to leak it to the internet before Khaled had a
    chance to yell all over it. Still, for someone so markedly devoid of talent,
    Khaled managed to throw together a surprisingly decent debut album last year. <em>Listennn...The
    Album</em> was a state-of-the-art rap compilation. Khaled apparently has ins
    with half of rap's biggest stars, and his disc probably could've coasted by on
    star-power alone. But he also employed most of Florida's better production
    teams, including Cool &amp; Dre and the Runners. And since these guys all work
    from the same basic sonic templates, <em>Listennn</em> was satisfyingly cohesive
    for a thrown-together mixtape of its kind, and it made a strong case for the
    epically plastic Miami synth-rap sound that was ascendant at the time.</p><p>
<em>We the Best</em> plainly attempts to follow up on the formula established
    by <em>Listennn</em>. First single ""We Takin' Over"" is every bit the
    equal of its <em>Listennn</em> predecessor, the worldbeating posse cut
    ""Holla At Me"". The new single wrangles an all-star lineup, boasting
    an ebulliently overblown Akon chorus and sandwiching a few just-OK verses from
    Rick Ross and Fat Joe and Birdman between two bravura star-turns. T.I. starts things
    off with brisk efficiency, and Lil Wayne masterfully caps the song off with
    deranged verve. The track builds beautifully to Wayne's climactic verse, and
    his performance would've been star-making if he weren't already a star: ""I
    am the beast/ Feed me rappers or feed me beats...""</p><p>
    If only the rest of <em>We the Best</em> held up to that song's enormous
    promise. Instead, we get a rapidly diminishing series of rote posse cuts, every
    guest claiming to be harder and richer than everyone else. When these sorts of
    swaggering egocentric brag-raps are done with the exhilarated glee of ""We
    Takin' Over"", they can be great, even transcendent. But when they're
    thrown-together and half-assed, as most of the tracks here are, they quickly
    become oppressively dull. ""Brown Paper Bag"" thinks it's a
    drug-dealing epic, but its tinny tuba-fart synths and wailing Bee Gees
    interpolation feel like overkill, and even Lil Wayne sounds bored and
    unmotivated. ""I'm So Hood"" wastes a monstrous Runners sandworm
    synth-wriggle and an awesomely overblown T-Pain chorus on a bunch of thoroughly
    anonymous rap verses. ""Hit Them Up"" is a standard-issue Paul Wall
    filler-track two years after that might mean something. ""New York""
    recruits the same lineup as the great 2004 Ja Rule single of the same name and
    fails to capture a single iota of that song's urgency and electricity. The
    mind-numbing six-minute Bone Thugs-N-Harmony showcase ""The
    Originators"" somehow manages to make those great Cleveland sing-rappers
    sound flat and boring. And when Rick Ross shows up on the first four songs on
    your album, you're in trouble.
    </p>
<p>
    The big problem with <em>We the Best</em> is its inert repetition; things get
    old fast when virtually every guest posits himself as an indestructible ghetto
    superhero. And so the album's few non-""We Takin' Over"" highlights
    come in those rare moments when the guest-rappers allow themselves to become
    human beings. On ""Before the Solution,"" Beanie Sigel bitterly vents
    frustration about his jail term, sounding powerfully angry and flawed in the
    process: ""What up with State Prop, the crew, are they not there?/ The
    moment that they heard it, the verdict, when it was declared/ Your boy had the
    city, yeah/ Did they disappear?/ Did Jay really not visit there?"" And
    ""I'm From the Ghetto"" has a nicely sentimental lilt, with a chorus of
    kids singing inspirational nonsense and fond but conflicted childhood
    reminisces from the Game and Jadakiss and Trick Daddy. And so <em>We the Best</em>,
    it turns out, is indicative of one of the major problems with mainstream rap
    lately: too many rappers seem unwilling to drop their defenses and speak
    plainly. In any case, it was probably too much to expect two consistently
    listenable albums from motherfucking DJ Khaled; we're lucky we even got one.

    One can only imagine Mr. and Mrs. James' reaction when Baby
    Jim spoke his first word in that
    God-given reverb-drenched voice of his. It seems more like a congenital trait than a
    byproduct of the band's recording environment, and James heightens the effect by
    drawing his Kentucky accent into
    a unique phrasing pattern. With My Morning Jacket, as well as with his previous
    Louisville outfit Month of Sundays, that reverb became as recognizable as
    Michael Stipe's introverted mumbling and Thom Yorke's strangled screech-- a
    means of distinguishing himself sonically from other bands, but more
    crucially, a means of communicating mystery in a way that no other sound or
    instrument could.</p><p>
    So it's fitting that Darla Records' long-delayed <em>Tennessee Fire and At Dawn Demos,</em> which
    collects rough cuts and live takes of songs from the late 1990s and early
    2000s, begins with a version of ""The Way That He Sings"", which James didn't
    write about himself but which many fans might write about him. Aside from an
    acoustic guitar, it's all vocals-- two tracks layered simply over one another to form both primary and backing vocals. Most of the songs here-- especially
    those from <em>Tennessee Fire</em>-- are
    similarly minimal, with little or no input from other band members. The music feels private and personal, as if these songs are creating their own weird
    spaces where they can play out unmolested by listener or artist intentions.</p><p>
    The
    demos for My Morning Jacket's 2001 breakthrough <em>At Dawn</em> feature more of the band, but without sacrificing that same sense
    of space. ""The Bear"" and especially ""Heartbreakin' Man"" sound like inspired
    practice sessions, informal but spirited, while ""War Begun"" and ""Twilight""-- both
    recorded live at local station WFPK 91.9 FM-- lose only a little of their effect
    for sounding so clean.
    </p>
<p>
    Like a painter's early pencil sketches or a writer's margin
    notes, demos are generally noteworthy only for revealing new facets of the finished, familiar works. In a
    sense, the <em>Tennessee Fire</em> demos might
    seem redundant because the studio tracks sound something like demos themselves, but
    these versions also track James' creative process of turning lyrical and
    melodic ideas into finished songs. ""Lowdown"" emphasizes his backing vocals more
    than his lead: Maybe he's singing those ba-ba-ba's as a guide for another
    instrument, but they become the focus of the song, its primary hook on the demo
    as well as on the album version. On the other hand, the early version of ""At Dawn"" is still a wisp of
    a song in search of a full band who can turn it into the heraldic opener that gives the group's second album its title. 
    </p>
<p>
    Delving even further back into My Morning Jacket lore,
    Removador Recordings and Solutions is releasing the only album by James'
    previous band, Month of Sundays. They formed in 1992 and recorded their first
    and only release in 1998, the same year My Morning Jacket formed. Saturated in
    the same reverb, these songs have seen only the most limited release until now. (They're available under the name Mont de Sundua, ostensibly so as not to conflict with
    any of the Months of Sundays that have sprouted and withered during the last
    nine years.) While the songs sound a little unformed and raw, <em>Mont</em><em> de Sundua</em> is hardly a skeleton in James'
    closet, and those looking for a Y Kant Tori Read embarrassment or some sort of
    sordid ska past will be sorely disappointed.
    </p>
<p>
    Instead, these songs reveal young men just discovering the
    power of drums and guitars, as well as the possibilities of unusual recording
    environments. It's often juvenile and unguided, given to meandering passages
    and noise for its own sake. There's a definite local feeling to the record, too, as
    if these songs could have been written and performed by any number of skatepunks hanging around outside the public library. But the band play their
    spacey jams with metal intensity, grinding their riffs into a fine powder on
    the massive opener ""Space Beast"" and ""One Salty Kiss"". And tracks like ""Wanna
    See My Bruise Again?"" and the sax-heavy ""Boots Bar"" show James' early range as
    a singer and songwriter, the group's dark atmosphere and confident quiet/loud
    dynamics pointing ahead to their career-making Darla output. Both of these
    releases are best heard alongside the two Darla full-lengths, which remain My
    Morning Jacket essentials. Instead of shrinking by comparison, these demos
    actually benefit from proximity to the official versions, offering an engaging
    and generous career recap and, more importantly, showing how James' songs live
    and breathe in different forms.

    The amount of wiggle room in grindcore is, well, practically nil. You don't wake up one day and decide, as a modern day grindcore auteur, that you're going to add a string section or a New Orleans brass band or the Polyphonic Spree as backup vocalists. (Even if what I've described there is basically Mr. Bungle.) Grindcore is a genre with established borders-- tempo is beyond fast, length of song is short, guitar tunings are abrasive, vocal-style is either shriek-y high or growl-y low, and subject matter is dark, if not outright disgusting-- that butt up against other genres (death metal on the one end, noise on the other) but are nonetheless patrolled by vicious attack dogs. The fact that Pitchfork is even reviewing a grindcore band is probably a good sign to the faithful that said band is a crossover act or, you know, false metal.</p><p>
    Well, yes and no. Pig Destroyer is grindcore, through and through, and on its new album, <em>Phantom Limb</em>, some of the songs are slightly longer (""Loathsome"" tops out at 4:04!) but many are well within the minute-and-a-half range. Singer J.R. Hayes still delivers his serial killer-chic lyrics (""Stench of solvent covers stench of rot/ I didn't even recognize her like a painting/ A masterpiece torn to pieces""; ""Your rib cage is open like a great white's jaws/ Your legs look so sexy out of context"") in an unintelligible, rasping shout that practically sprays you with acidic saliva. The guitars still feel like you're being pushed ear-first into a knife-grinder's stone, and the beats are often still more of a landslide of cymbal and snare than anything you can even bang your head to. The band still deploys shock-horror samples about bodies on fire and whatnot. But <em>Phantom Limb</em> is such a quantum leap even beyond Pig Destroyer's earlier, already pretty fuckin' awesome records that it might as well represent a quantum leap for the whole goddamn genre.</p><p>
    Pig Destroyer have always stood slightly outside grindcore's formal restrictions; for one thing, their sound is instantly recognizable, a plus when even fans sometimes have trouble telling one 30-second song from another. The band had no trouble distinguishing themselves at a performance a few weeks ago at the Maryland Deathfest, a three-day festival devoted to extreme metal and grindcore here in Baltimore: Whereas so many other bands that weekend had a rhythm section so tightly wound (and badly tuned) that their snare drums sounded like a guy whacking a hat box with a ballpoint pen, Pig Destroyer had a beefy low-end, a chest-punching, hefty bottom to its blurred blast beats. (All the more astounding considering there's no actual bass guitar involved.) And Hayes' vocals are ugly and shoved through a layer of distortion-- Pig Destroyer actually brought a noise dude, Blake Harrison, in to add, well, noise to <em>Phantom Limb</em>-- but they're never comical, his thick sneer-roar clamping your throat and giving you the evil-eye.</p><p>
    All of this carries over on record to <em>Phantom Limb</em>. But what really sets the album apart is <em>riffs</em>. It's still not ""catchy,"" but the chewy bits of Southern-flavored rock'n'roll guitar that Pig Destroyer leaves like bloody gristle on otherwise bleached bones offers something for every rock fan to gnaw on. For a few seconds before the very end, ""Lesser Animal"" verily <em>boogies</em> until it tightens up into the dopesick bad vibes of Eyehategod. ""Heathen Temple"" shrieks like a Judas Priest solo hacked to fleshy chunks before Scott Hull's ZZ Top-meets-Kerry King riffing actually starts pogoing up and down like a lowrider. With another rubbery, bottom-heavy riff, ""Loathsome"" is the most mosh-worthy song of the year-- I know you don't see it much at Beirut shows, but people do still mosh-- and the breakdown is even kinda (eep!) <em>funky</em>. And guitar heroics aren't the only way Pig Destroyer fucks with grindcore orthodoxy on <em>Phantom Limb</em>. ""Fourth Degree Burns"" is a <em>love song</em>, and not one in which Haynes dismembers the object of his affection at the end: ""Tomorrow she'll step on that plane and disappear/ But tonight her lips are real/ And kissing like a head-on collision."" (I guess even romantic metaphors have to be violent in grindcore.)</p><p>
    After hearing <em>Phantom Limb</em>, a friend of mine noted that Pig
    Destroyer ""only do the one thing, but dammit if it's not a fun thing.""
    And true enough-- even with a palette that now includes veiny blues and
    sickly greens among the plasma reds and vomit ochres, <em>Phantom Limb</em> is
    not for everyone, especially if you have a low tolerance for music that
    delights in its own ugliness. But if you've ever remotely cared about heavy music--
    whether you haven't bought a metal record since that last Megadeth LP
    in junior high or you're neck deep in one-man black metal bands from
    the ass-end of Tasmania-- buy the fuckin' thing already.

    It's a ritual that sometimes seems nearly as old as the recording process itself. A young band, after releasing several homespun self-recorded albums, finally enters the studio with a bona fide producer and the seemingly contradictory intent to capture a more faithful reproduction of their live sound. Such is the familiar course taken by Minus Story on <em>My Ion Truss</em>, the Midwestern group's third full-length release on Jagjaguwar and their fifth overall. With the assistance of veteran producer John Congleton, who has also done the honors for Explosions in the Sky and the Polyphonic Spree, Minus Story have here crafted what is surely their most vibrant and full-bodied rock album to date, although often at the expense of the ramshackle charm of their earlier work.</p><p>
    On 2004's <em>The Captain Is Dead, Let the Drum Corpse Dance</em>, Minus Story displayed lo-fi psychedelic tendencies expansive enough to nearly merit unofficial entry into the Elephant 6 squadron. And though <em>My Ion Truss</em> still allows the occasional crazed sax solo or fleeting glimpse of distorted flute, the past few years have seen the group's sound grow considerably more streamlined and amped-up, increasing their resemblance to the rangy, guitar-centered likes of Built to Spill or Modest Mouse. This gradual evolution here comes to fruition in some of the group's most robust material yet, but it appears to make some unfair demands of vocalist Jordan Geiger-- whose earnest, reedy pipes can sound incongruous and faintly overwhelmed as things get progressively noisier behind him.</p><p>
    Although Minus Story did include a wry cover of the Misfits' ""Hybrid Moments"" on their 2005 <em>Heaven and Hell</em> EP, there is little in their past catalog that directly foreshadows such raucous new tracks as ""Aaron"" or the hard-driving ""Beast at My Side"". With Congleton's steady hand at the controls, the group was able to record many of the basic tracks for the album live, and these rowdier cuts deliver a surprising and satisfying punch. The anthemic ""Stitch Me Up"" benefits hugely its wide-open live drum sound, as do ""Battle of Our Lives"" and ""Pretty in the Light"" which each use the band's quirky, fitful song structures to amplify the lyrics' own oblique interior dramas. Likewise, on ""The Way Beyond"" the group expertly weaves a rhythm of handclaps and drum machines beneath their vocal harmonies and piano for what seems like a polished, more sophisticated advancement of their early psych-pop pluralism. 
    </p>
<p>
    The skies soon grow quieter as <em>My Ion Truss</em> progresses, however, and the album's second half is weighted heavily with introspective, crooning pop. This trend plays better to Geiger's strengths, as he sounds right at home on the clean, piano-driven ""Parachute"" and the keening ""Mama Mama"", although it can be rather disquieting to hear his boyish voice pleading out to ""mama"" on the latter, sounding like a traumatized teen sent home sick from school. The imbalance between the album's softer and more hard-driving material makes for an interesting dynamic, but one can't help but miss some of the whimsy and scrappy invention of Minus Story's early work. Even so, the group appear so firmly in control of their performances here that there can be little question that this is the sound they've been striving for all along, and that it only took a little help from an outside producer like Congleton to help coax them into their more natural state.

    I thought I had been dragged to way too many Renaissance Fairs and war
    re-enactments as a kid to stomach Ann Arbor's resident folk historians the
    Great Lakes Myth Society. Even potentially worse, they sound equally excited to
    recount regional lore as the people who dress up like Robert E. Lee and Queen
    Elizabeth for a living. However, the band, which essentially consists of the
    Original Brothers and Sisters of Love lineup minus violinist Liz Auchinvole,
    manages to create songs that, while looking back to the past, boast their share
    of forward-thinking ideas.</p><p>
    You could argue that Sufjan Stevens' critically adored depictions of two
    major Great Lakes states should banish this band to obsolescence. However,
    whereas Stevens' manifest destiny seems to draw him across the country to
    record 48 more masterpieces, the Myth Society keeps their eyes on a much
    smaller, humbler prize. Conjured by the nasally yet charming dual lead vocals
    of Timony and James Monger, the Mitten State nostalgia often concedes to the
    much more interesting harmonization and melodies. ""Queen of the Barley
    Fool"" tells of the age-old one-two punch of inebriation and star-crossed
    love, its lyrical content no more contemporary than an Irish traditional, yet
    the track rocks a country-tinged power-pop chorus worthy of a spot on a New
    Pornographers album.</p><p>
    At their liveliest and most reverb-drenched, the hooks here scrape the
    Shins/New Pornographers stratosphere of catchiness despite a stilted folksy
    musk continually bringing them back down to earth. Bouncy, threadbare ballads
    like ""Nightfall at Electric Park"" and ""Stump Speech"" reach
    for the ear though are eventually willing to settle for a hippy-worthy hug
    instead, both melting into new age feel-goodness after establishing more urgent
    melodies. Even when they try to kick out the jams, nature still calls.
    ""Debutante"" interrupts the album's mostly gentle strumming with
    churning power chords and a fist-pumping verse, though by the third gooey
    sing-along chorus it's back to the campfire, the testosterone release over.
    </p>
<p>
    While they're still chasing down that sort of majestic folk anthem that
    echoes throughout the mountains, the band improves upon its self-titled debut
    with a much more consistent, confident album in <em>Compass Rose Bouquet</em>.
    Sure, they're not holding a candle to the narrative folk of Sufjan Stevens, but
    they've been doing this regional mythology stuff for about a decade now.
    Although they're not the catchiest or most emotionally powerful band or even
    the most popular Great Lakes yarn-spinners, the band's carved a unique niche
    that no indie folk monolith can wrest away from them.

    Credit the UK with this: their bands are exceptionally fast at processing
    trends, evolving in mere weeks where their American cousins often take whole
    months or-- gasp!-- even years to catch up. As Blur and Oasis battled it out on
    the charts, dozens of copycats battled it out to be the next Blur or Oasis.
    Nearly every iteration of U2 instantly inspired its share of imitators. When
    Radiohead went weird, a hundred British bands went weird with them. After
    Coldplay hit it big playing nice, many of those would-be revolutionaries
    decided a hug was better than a slap, and likewise put down their guitars in
    favor of pianos.</p><p>
    Hell, sometimes the British even pick up on American trends before Americans
    do. Witness the overseas rise of the White Stripes or Strokes before their
    domestic breakthroughs. In retrospect, the success of the Strokes in particular
    seems to have been the major catalyst for the UK's current guitar revolution,
    setting the stage for the galvanizing arrival of the Libertines and, later, the
    Arctic Monkeys. These are hybrid acts of a sort, shaggy, reluctant, and rough
    like their fame-wary American indie cousins but still swaggering and confident
    like their UK predecessors.</p><p>
    God only know what the impact of the Libertines or the Arctic Monkeys will
    fully evince in the near future, but clearly the wheels are already in motion.
    In fact, however tangential their styles, it's hard to imagine the Maccabees
    existing without either of those bands as predecessors or peers, not to mention
    even more likeminded acts such as Bloc Party or the Futureheads (fellow
    rediscoverers of the Gang of Four and XTC). In fact, even though the Maccabees
    have been humping it out for a few years now, the group's debut <em>Colour It In</em>
    sounds so banally of-the-now that it beggars the imagination.
    </p>
<p>
    Fittingly, it turns out, as imagination is just what the disc so sorely
    lacks. The Maccabees supposedly settled on their name after picking it randomly
    from the Bible, which is just as well, since the band sounds like they settled
    on their sound as arbitrarily, albeit with an eye toward the charts. Indeed,
    the record is frontloaded with the band's breakthrough UK singles, but those
    singles do the band no favors. ""X-Ray"", with its call-and-response
    vocals and slashing guitars, is a total Gang of Four cop. ""Latchmere""
    is the band's entry into the proud UK tradition of documenting the quotidian,
    in this case a London indoor pool and ""leisure center""
    (""Latchmere's got a wave machine,"" goes the song). 
    </p>
<p>
    In between is the token XTC number ""All in Your Rows"", making the
    most out of Orlando Weeks' affected yelp. Later on the group even tosses a few
    love songs into the mix, albeit love songs of a particularly creepy bent.
    ""Precious Time"" features the icky Bon Scotty line ""I held you
    down and I held my own."" ""First Love"" is probably meant to be
    self-deprecating, but ""I've made my bed I'll lie in it and pillow talk you
    into it"" is a far cry from clever. And if there's surely a sad back-story
    to ""Lego"" and ""Tissue Shoulders"", neither is compelling
    enough to linger too long over. 
    </p>
<p>
    The album doesn't do a lot of lingering itself, but even at a brisk 35
    minutes, <em>Colour It In</em> struggles to overcome the suspicion you've heard
    it all before. Not just from another band, mind, but from just five minutes
    ago, on the same CD, from the same band. No doubt, there's a certain effortless
    quality to the rush of hooks and herky-jerk rhythms, but that's not to say the
    Maccabees shouldn't have put a little more effort into them. With studiously
    idiosyncratic songs and easy sentimentalism, the group has started its career
    backed into a corner by its would-be trademarks. The Maccabees are all wound
    up, but with nowhere to go. At least not until some other band mutates and
    points them in a new direction.

    By virtue of surviving for so long, the Beastie Boys are doomed to perennially attract the hoariest of reviewer crutches: The trip down memory lane. My Beasties remembrances aren't as libelous as some; consisting mainly of a long, sweaty, suburban bike ride to find a record store that would sell me <em>Ill Communication</em> without a parent or guardian present. Boy, the old critical rubric sure was simpler back then, where the Beastie Boys stood apart from all that rap music I was dismissive/scared of for two simple reasons: 1) They used to be a <em>punk band</em>!, and 2) They <em>play</em> their own <em>instruments</em>!<span style=""font-size: 10pt""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Times New Roman""> </font></span>Those criteria come back to play half a life later with the Beastie Boys' new record, <em>The Mix-Up</em>, their first all-instrumental non-compilation full-length.</p><p>
    Here, the Beasties get half the equation right; as the tepid reaction to <em>To the 5 Boroughs</em> illustrated, not too many people want to hear them rap any more. The other half of the concept is somewhat questionable though, i.e. do we really want to hear what the Beastie Boys sound like as a band? In 2007? After all, the group seemingly only re-picked-up their instruments in the first place to circumvent the copyright hysteria they themselves started with <em>Paul's Boutique</em>, jamming to create sample material and the occasional interlude for <em>Check Your Head</em> and its successors.</p><p>
<span style=""font-size: 10pt""></span>Yet here is <em>The Mix-Up</em> anyway, with the Boys mic-less, back behind their chosen instruments (Horovitz-- guitar, Yauch-- bass, Diamond-- drums) and swollen to a five-piece with longtime keyboardist Money Mark and percussionist Alfredo Ortiz. The record runs the gamut of the Beasties' instrumental tastes, all the way from dub to funk to dubby funk and funky dub. While less content with Blaxploitation recreation than they used to be, most of <em>The Mix-Up</em> still sounds more like soundtracks for imaginary 70s B-flicks (names like ""The Melee"" and ""Electric Worm"" don't hurt) than the post-punk touchpoint laundry list Mike D offered in advance interviews-- nobody's gonna mistake this record for !!!.
    </p>
<p>
    It's every instrumental rock record's responsibility to come off as more than just a collection of studio jam sessions, and that's where <em>The Mix-Up</em> ultimately fails. Beastie Boys lore is that they warm up for each record by improvising like-so, but the 12 songs here don't suggest that the results of those exercises are worth more than raw sampling material. Despite lively additions of percussive texture (the whistle on ""The Rat Cage"", the vibes on ""14<sup>th</sup> St. Break"") and some peppy organ from Money Mark, the Beasties prove little more than their tightness as a band, cred points that would've been valuable 10 to 15 years ago, but are severely deflated after a million praises of the Roots' instrumental chops.
    </p>
<p>
    True, there are few overtly embarrassing moments here, though the fake-sitar of ""Dramastically Different"" comes close. And very occasionally, the band hits upon something new (for them), like the refreshingly bold (if a wee bit jambandy) guitar riffs that slice through the noodle-funk plod of ""Off the Grid"" and ""The Rat Cage"". But the spic-span production keeps the occasional nugget from proving itself as a potential grade-A break, with no obvious loops jumping out of the speakers like the itchy thud of ""So Whatcha Want"" or the fuzz-punk of ""Gratitude.""<span style=""font-size: 10pt""></span>
</p>
<p>
    More worrisome than anything, there's a distinct lack of fun in the instrumental wankage of <em>The Mix-Up</em>, a bad sign for a band that has seen their results fade in direct proportion to how seriously they take themselves. The soundtrack homage pieces collected on <em>The In Sound From Way Out!</em> may have been the musical equivalent of the goofy costumes donned for the ""Sabotage"" video, but the Beasties' reverence for references was infectious, as songs like ""Son of Neckbone"" worked like no-words versions of their manic name-dropping rhymes. In an environment where a rap group that plays instruments is no longer the novelty it was fifteen years ago, the Beastie Boys could've used a bit of that personality, rather than trying too hard to prove their chops in chin-stroking, and ultimately forgettable, fashion.

    ""I miss Grant McLennan"" read the t-shirt worn by Stars
    singer Torquil
    Campbell at last summer's Lollapalooza. Surely those sentiments summed
    up the thoughts of at least a few others in the crowd. A few, but not many.
    Sadly, for most of their existence and certainly throughout their long 1990s
    hiatus, the Go-Betweens stayed one of the music world's best-kept secrets,
    unimpeachably good but somehow unable to convince the masses of their
    strengths.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    While the mainstream more or less ignored the group
    throughout its tenure, the critics raved. When the Australian band's back
    catalog was first remastered and reissued, each disc came wrapped in a second
    sleeve covered with breathless contemporaneous accolades, the kiss of death if
    ever there was one. After all, no one likes being told what's good for them, so
    whether writ tiny on the CD cover or plastered on billboards, it was probably
    just not to be.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    At the same time, the Go-Betweens weren't quite a cult act,
    either. The songs of Robert Forster and Grant McLennan were too classy for
    that, too smart, and their audience modest, even by cult standards. The band's
    albums were more like great little novels, with Forster and McLennan their
    tandem authors, talked about and taught to a self-selecting student pool but
    far from beach reads. Not surprisingly, when the group reunited after a long
    hiatus, only a handful of people showed up to a 1999 acoustic duo gig in Chicago,
    a pitiful turnout for a band of their stature but a true pleasure for the few
    that turned up. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Admittedly, once the new albums started coming again, that
    audience grew, but it was a matter of building up lost momentum as well as
    making up for lost time. Not that the years between Go-Betweens' group activity
    were in any way truly lost. During the gap, Forster and McLennan embarked on
    parallel solo careers, with mostly fruitful results. Speaking to McLennan
    shortly before his death, I told him that I actually liked a couple of his solo
    albums better than a couple of the much-vaunted Go-Betweens albums. Famously
    modest but equally honest, McLennan responded, ""I do, too.""
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Of course, it's McLennan's untimely 2006 passing that's
    prompted this retrospective of his and Forster's respective solo outputs. No
    doubt were McLennan still alive, the two would be working on a follow-up to the
    great swan song <em>Oceans Apart</em>, but Forster was quick to recognize the obvious: Without his musical partner of so many decades, the Go-Betweens were done for
    good. So here we are, not exactly looking back at a band but at<span> </span>its two principals, and in particular
    one songwriter who has left us with nothing to look forward to. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    If the Go-Betweens slipped under the radar, McLennan's solo
    career was essentially off the map. But as the Go-Betweens' poppier, more
    conventional (but no less poetic) songwriter, his solo output does deserve to
    be held in equal esteem with his best Go-Betweens work. Arranged
    chronologically, McLennan's half of <em>The Best of the Solo Recordings:
    1990-1997</em> features song after song of heartbreak, hooks, and, for the
    uninitiated, revelations.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span> </span>""Black Mule"",
    from <em>Watershed</em>, would have worked on the Go-Betweens' hushed <em>16 Lovers Lane</em>, while the absolutely gorgeous ""The Dark Side of Town"", the
    bittersweet pop gem ""Lighting Fires"", and the anthemic ""Surround Me"" (all from <em>Fireboy)</em> must have driven McLennan nuts, knowing that songs as good as those
    he was cranking out were for the most part destined for the void. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    In fact, McLennan's 1994 <em>Horsebreaker Star</em> found him
    recording in America in hopes of finally finding a bigger and more appreciative
    audience, but as usual the plan failed to work out. Ever prolific, he still came
    up with a double disc of material, most of it ace (the haunting title track is
    one of the few to make it to this double disc set). Songs like ""One Plus One"",
    from McLennan's final solo album <em>In Your Bright Ray</em>, again would have been
    perfect on some lost Go-Betweens disc, showing how remarkably consistent
    McLennan remained as a solo act.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Robert Forster was easily the more quirky writer in the
    Go-Betweens, and his solo career reflects that. His half of <em>Solo Recordings</em>, arranged to his liking, features Forster in all his
    speak-sing glory, making up in charm, modest melody and a curious turn of
    phrase what he sometimes lacked in outright pop instincts. ""She reminded me of
    Africa, though I've never been"" (from ""I Can Do"") is the kind of typically
    enigmatic line Forster regularly gets off over the course of the collection,
    sung with just a hint of a wink.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But Forster was no pop slouch, either, and once again just
    about every one of his tracks included on this comp could have probably worked
    as-is on a Go-Betweens album, particularly the more melancholy ""I've Been
    Looking for Somebody"" and ""I'll Jump"" (though maybe not the Nick Cave-esque
    melodrama of ""Cryin' Love"" or ""Danger in the Past""). Missing is any material
    from Forster's more or less disowned covers record <em>I Had a New York
    Girlfriend</em>, which at least revealed the breadth of the guy's interests with
    covers from every corner, the expected (Bob Dylan) and the unexpected (Grant Hart)
    alike. 
    </p>
    As of
    late, Forster's been focusing on prose-- music criticism, ironically-- though
    it really doesn't take an expert or critic to recognize that neither he nor
    McLennan, collectively or individually, ever stood much of a chance on the
    charts. That's why they made such great fits for one another in the Go-Betweens.
    Up to the end, the band made music that demanded to be heard by being as good
    as it could possibly be, simple as that. That people didn't listen says less
    about the music than it does about the people not listening. This collection
    reminds how, despite it all, both writers followed a similarly straight,
    dedicated and principled path as solo artists, making music very much of a

    A couple of years ago, someone unearthed and posted a number of drum tracks from the recording sessions to Led Zeppelin's <em>In Through the Out Door</em>. Running about 29 minutes and given the name ""The John Henry Bonham Files"", the tracks isolated the technique of one of rock's most versatile and powerful drummers: ""Moby Dick"" proved Bonham could solo, but it was rare to hear him just lay down the rhythm unencumbered by the rest of the band. As a scrap of music history, it's fascinating, but as an album it's not something you'd want to sit around listening to for more than about five minutes-- with nothing but the drums, you start missing Jimmy Page's guitar and Robert Plant's vocals and, hell, even John Paul Jones' synthesizer.</p><p>
    So if Bonzo couldn't carry a half hour's worth of recorded material on his own, how could Tortoise's three percussionists pull it off? Apparently, their side project has a specific extra-musical intent: Bumps' debut has been calculated to serve a purpose as a breakbeat record of sorts, which goes a little way towards explaining its appearance on the hip-hop-centric Stones Throw label. And it makes a certain kind of sense, depending on how much it'd cost to farm these out to producers. Samples aren't exactly like fossil fuels-- they're not finite, for one thing-- but they do share the quality of being a lot more expensive than they used to be, and there's been a decade-plus groundswell of visionaries who've spent a lot of time developing inexpensive alternatives. Tortoise are one of post rock's most culturally omnivorous bands, so their percussive core-- consisting of Dan Bitney, John Herndon, and John McEntire-- seem like a good fit for a project like this.</p><p>
<em>Bumps </em>caters extensively to the sample-using demographic's core musical tendencies, with many of its 23 tracks couched in a number of different rhythmic contexts that fit almost every imaginable dance groove. And with nothing but the beat present, it's easy to imagine these rhythms slotted into multiple contexts. The conga and woodblock-augmented freight-train rattle of ""A Safe Balm"" could equally pass for afrobeat or the chase theme from a 1970s action film soundtrack. ""Fun Injury"" captures a lot of big beat's Northern Soul frenzy, but with a bit of judicious cutting and splicing it could also work like a version of jungle's ""Amen"" break turned inside-out. And it's anybody's guess as to who'd be the first to snatch up the bass-drum 4/4 boom of ""Biotic Discussion"": A one-man indie-punk bedroom producer piecing together a pastiche of his favorite A Certain Ratio songs, or a house producer-slash-disco revivalist hooked on recapturing that early 1980s West End Records feel. (Either way, they'd both benefit.)</p><p>
    Most of the tracks ride on a malleable percussive tautness, usually starting with a deceptively simple figure and then rounding things out with some additional fills or transitions. And their timbre tends to range from subdued, almost drum machine-esque flatness (""Craven"") to teeming walls of tight-wound bass (""Dawn at Dawn"") to creaking, aluminum-echo-chamber dub (""A Dumb Month""). It's clear that they've accounted for all kinds of production styles and aesthetics for their potential usage as loops; ""Bin Johnston"" sounds clean and resilient enough for radio-ready neo-soul, while ""Can You See?"" pushes things so abrasively into the red that only the most junkyard-aesthetic corners of indie rap could comfortably rock over it.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, this isn't just a breakbeat mine-- it's a record, and as a release aimed at the everyday consumer it doesn't provide the most substantial or satisfying experience. As tight and as professional as everything sounds, it's still hard to shake the feeling that this sounds like a demo track from some unfinished sessions. While a few of the tracks stand on their own as likeable diversions and would probably sound interesting coming out of nowhere in a 3,500-song shuffle, there's enough stylistic redundancy and a deliberate sense of unfinished composition (nearly half the tracks are less than 90 seconds, and all but one are 2:02 or shorter) to make listening to it beginning to end the epitome of pointlessness. Some records sound good on a shitty old boombox, and some are most easily appreciated on an expensive hi-fi system with an audiophile turntable, but <em>Bumps</em> is an oddity: album that doesn't really sound its best unless you're patching it through an SP-1200.

As it happens, <em>Gentleman on the Rocks</em> is all over the place in a way that many contemporary indie rock fans will appreciate. It has glimmers of Annuals' twinkling, close-at-ear guitars, the sashays of Matt Pond, and the jerking, yet peaceful rhythmic patterns of the Junior Boys. The transitions to and from such disparate sounds can be wonderful: The interlude-like wanderings of ""Lightweight Drinking"" meld into the emo throwback ""Grand Eclipse"" by way of organ synths and a simple, forlorn yet sexy guitar line that repeats throughout the song. The whole of ""Eclipse"" is glossed with an ornately electronic atmosphere, making it one of the most engrossing tracks on the album.</p><p>
    But there are also less successful tracks like ""Arlington Curse"", a friendly, thumping anthem with a dull melody and too much yelping. The harmonies can be (intentionally?) sloppy, making for an intoxicated, dizzy experience that works for the Hold Steady and some emo aficionados. But Coyote Bones are neither of these-- these days: the pair, with contributions from Orenda Fink of Azure Ray, Dan McCarthy (Tilly and the Wall, Bright Eyes), Jacob Thiele of the Faint, and a handful more, are flitting between popular acoustic and electronic tropes, only occasionally hitting the mark. ""Don't Lose Your Cool"" is an example of when rabid harmonic reaches actually work, sounding purposefully strained and emotive rather than messy and unrehearsed; but that is only a moment of pleasure in an otherwise transitional song. Effects tricks, keys, and drum machines are at pretty much every band's disposal, but it doesn't always feel natural. ""Fated to Fail"" is a blogger's favorite, and the delicate pulsation of beat plus keyboard and fluttering female vocals makes for a lovely three minutes: still anthemic, a bit depressing, and possessing a clarity of sound that perfects the message, a mournful second-person narrative about being true to...your previous band, from the sound of it.</p><p>
    The undulating guitars and washes of synth effects on ""Fated to Fail"" and a couple of other tracks are concrete reminders of Jet By Day, and sit squarely between the purely pop and occasionally grungy pieces that permeate the rest of the album. ""Your War"" makes for an irritating finish: It's an attempt at a dirty rock song that is neatly packaged and well composed on its own, but makes little sense as a tack-on to an otherwise elegant and/or peaceable batch. Acoustic number ""Paint on Your Jeans"" is aurally gorgeous but lacks originality of melody or sophistication of idea. ""39 Forever"", however, turns that statement around, being rudimentary with its instruments, but prodding a simple verse at a wildly surprising and strong chorus, which builds strength in numbers and keeps evolving. It's easily the best song on the album, a great wallop of power pop that, once again, makes a pretty transition to the sole piano showcase, ""Buzzing Below"".  The band can't be applauded for enacting every musical idea that they do, because not all of them work, but those few good cases bolster the rest, which are, at the very least, engineered and executed well.</p><p>

    They Shoot Horses Don't They make what could best be
    described as headache music. It certainly gives me one. It's a shame that other
    horse band got to the title <em>Everything
    All the Time</em> before TSHDT could, because it'd be a perfect title for them.
    The nine members of the band are all almost constantly engaged, blaring away
    with horns, drums, basses, guitars, and yelping, hyperactive vocals. Both times
    I listened to it on headphones, I had to keep turning it down to help my ears
    out and allow myself to think.</p><p>
    No doubt this Vancouver
    collective has a unique sound-- their all-out large band assault has a lurching,
    dissonant quality that accentuates its busyness and density. The vocals
    sometimes remind me of Head of Femur, but that band's sense of contour and
    melody isn't in effect here. Rather, these arrangements have a remarkably flat
    sense of dynamics for all their diversity. The horns, somewhat reminiscent of
    King Crimson circa <em>Lizard</em>, are used primarily
    to deepen the texture, and as such play often with little melodic material to
    latch onto.</p><p>
    Some of the fault for the album's crowded feel lies with the
    production, which provides no separation between the sounds in the mix. On
    closer ""Wrong Directions"", for instance, short horn phrases back short vocal
    phrases while the drums do everything in their power to avoid propelling the
    song, but all those sounds, and a few others to boot, are rubbing right up next
    to each other. If the vocal melody were to be memorable at all, any hook it
    might provide is dashed by interference from the horns. The song has distinct
    chorus and verse sections, but they're rendered indistinguishable by the
    cacophonic arrangement and recording technique.
    </p>
<p>
    That's not to say many of the vocal melodies are especially
    memorable on their own terms. They tend to consist of clipped phrases contorted
    to fit the lyrics and fit in with the drum patterns. The lack of driving rhythm
    means the songs never gain any kind of momentum, and as a result never feel
    like they're going anywhere. ""The Guest"" starts out dense and just gets denser
    as the band fakes a buildup by piling on more keyboards and processed vocals,
    and the rhythm section just thrashes away in place, failing to carry all that
    noise to a destination. ""A Place Called LA"" actually kicks off with a hook, as
    a lone organ plays a little two-chord riff, and the drums play along with a
    galloping beat-- this alone makes it an easy standout, but the vocals are so
    unmelodic that a lot of the interest generated in those early moments
    dissipates. 
    </p>
    Little else separates itself, but there are a few
    songs that provide interesting moments. ""What Is That?"" is much sparser and
    quieter than the rest of the record, and though it's melodically engaging, it's
    a much-needed respite late in the album. ""Speck of Dust"" is also less dense at
    first, but when the band ramps up two and a half minutes in, it feels less like
    payoff and more like an intrusion. TSHDT have many ingredients for interesting
    music, but as on their other two albums, those ingredients as currently
    employed don't add up to anything very palatable.</div>"|10340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10340-pick-up-sticks/|3.7|Joe Tangari

    This was not the Ryan Adams album I was
    expecting. I ended up downloading the leak like a hardened criminal because these days labels send out the kind of CDs that don't play on computers (otherwise, albums might
    leak). Squinting at my iPod, I misread the title of one of the songs as
    ""Ryan Adams Rip Off"", and I suddenly hoped this was going to
    be his self-referential comedy album. You know, the follow-up to recent stunts like
    Adams' online-only 2006 hip-hop debut ""<strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/track_review/38866-welcome-to-ryan-adams-dot-com-motherfucka-aw-shit"">Welcome to Ryan Adams Dot Com Motherfucka (Aw Shit)</a></strong>"". That there's a track called
    ""Halloween Head"" only furthered my suspicions. A couple of days later I realized <em>all</em> the songs on my MP3 rip had Ryan Adams' name
    in the title; there's just a tagging error I'd somehow only noticed on one.<br/></p><p>
    As it turns out, the singer-songwriter's ninth studio album since Whiskeytown is more consistent-- if more predictable and less spectacular-- than pretty much any other record in his exhaustive
    catalog. If 2001's <em>Gold</em> was a bid
    for the ""multi-platinum ring,"" as Pitchfork's Chris Schiel
    put it, the music on <em>Easy Tiger</em> suggests Adams is vying for a spot on the Starbucks CD rack<em>.  </em>This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in contrast to  <em>Gold</em>, or his inspired 2000 solo pinnacle <em>Heartbreaker</em>, the move feels like a forced attempt to grub some crossover
    dollars and prime retail exposure.</p><p>
    Hell, it just might work, even if there's no ""New York, New York""
    here, or ""Come Pick Me Up"", or whichever your favorite Adams song
    might be. Because even while <em>Easy Tiger</em> consists mostly of second-tier
    Adams songs, it remains blessedly free of the third-tier compositions that marred 2002's <em>Demolition</em>, 2003 two-fer <em>Rock
    N Roll </em>and<em> Love Is Hell</em>, and the
    last of Adams' 2005 triptych, <em>29</em>. These
    new songs don't always offer enough to cling to after repeat plays the way his best songs do, but producer Jamie Candiloro-- who has also worked with R.E.M.,
    Luscious Jackson, and Luna-- helps put together a sonic landscape that
    makes any room feel oh so tastefully arranged.
    </p>
<p>
    Adams has used several of his albums to stake out new (old) stylistic territory the way other bands switch wardrobes. <em>Easy Tiger</em>, however,<em> </em>is practically a
    compilation of his past seven years, minus <em>Rock
    N Roll</em>'s new wave bent. The Cardinals, who played backup on the three
    2005 LPs, return here to the loose, dueling-guitar jams of <em>Cold Roses</em> on opener ""Goodnight Rose"", and to the steel-twang country of <em>Jacksonville City Nights</em> on ""Tears
    of Gold"". They even leave Adams alone for
    <em>Heartbreaker</em>-style finger-picking on
    the lonely-boy lament ""These Girls"" (a cast-off from 2000's unreleased <em>Destroyer</em>). Despite harmonica that recalls ""Come Pick Me Up"", the wistful finale ""I Taught Myself How to
    Grow"" might just as easily belong on sad-bastard Anglophile outing <em>Love Is Hell</em>. So could another crashing
    piano ballad, ""Off Broadway"", about being lost in your own city. 
    </p>
<p>
    For a change, let's talk about Adams' voice-- how he shapes phrases and sentences, and occasionally slides them
    around the edges of the beat during ""Goodnight
    Rose"" and the mellow acoustic rocker ""Everybody Knows"" (with its
    heartbreaking refrain, ""You and I together, but only one of us in
    love""). A gifted chameleon, Adams' voice transforms from a fragile <em>After the Gold Rush </em>whine on ""Off Broadway"" and the
    album's finale, to a huskier, low-register rasp on dull mid-tempo rocker ""Two
    Hearts"" and the folky ""Oh My God, Whatever, Etc."" He goes husky to a fault on the contrived ""The Sun Also Sets""-- a stark contrast to his stoic country croon on the down-home ""Pearls on a String"". Fittingly, the free-wheeling opener and its anachronistic
    vernacular (""the whole she-bang"") take Adams back to the Jerry Garcia tones of <em>Cold Roses</em>, stretched rolling-paper-thin. If what Adams is singing often veers
    toward vague maxims (""Don't live your life in such a hurry/ Life goes by
    us all too fast""), at least he's got the delivery down. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    I wasn't entirely off-base about <em>Easy Tiger</em>'s good humor, either. ""Rip Off"" is just a moseying
    country-rock exercise that packs some brutal honesty (""It's a little too late for
    goodbyes,"" Adams opines), but chugging rocker
    ""Halloween Head"" is so much funnier than its title suggests: ""Here comes that same old shit again/ I've got a
    Halloween head,"" it begins. When there's a guitar solo, Adams shouts, ""Guitar solo!"" And when the song ends, we hear piped-in thundershowers, straight out of the Doors' ""Riders on the Storm"". Just as another larger-than-life figure, R. Kelly, went from ""Bump N' Grind"" to ""Ignition (Remix)"" to the comic stylings of ""Sex Planet"", Adams has gone from ""My Winding Wheel"" to ""Wonderwall"" to <em>this</em>. Man, I really wish he'd made a whole album's worth. 
    </p>
<p>
    The full-court press push behind <em>Easy Tiger</em> suggests that the AOR consistency of its music is the result
    of Adams' newfound sobriety. (Then again, the guy has self-mythologized so long we should assign ratings to his news clippings.) But ""Two"", the album's first single and a duet with Sheryl Crow,
    encapsulates <em>Easy Tiger</em>'s best and
    worst-- a tight band, spare yet evocative vocals, but also undercooked lyrics
    and a twangy, light-rock approach that verges on total snooze. According to <em>The New York Times</em>, Adams scrawled a caricature of himself singing lyrics that spoof the song's chorus:
    ""Blah, blah, blah, whine, whine, whine/ It takes two when it used to take
    one."" See? Comedy <em>Gold</em>.

The Queens-born MC went to high school with Mobb Deep's Havoc and Prodigy, founded the seminal Organized Konfusion with Prince Po, and ghostwrote for Diddy on <em>Press Play</em>. But the brain-bending lyricist remains best known for a quartet of laddering synth bleats (the uncleared <em>Godzilla</em> sample from ""Simon Says"" that got his debut solo album, <em>Internal Affairs</em>, pulled from shelves) and a command to ""get the fuck up"" so irrefutable in that ""<em>how </em>the fuck up?"" was the only possible response.</p><p>
    His long-delayed sophomore album, <em>Desire</em>, is primed to change that. It's a best-of-both-worlds record, formulated something like this: backpack-rap's sense of social justice (minus shrill self-righteousness) and overclocked verbiage (minus rhythmic malaise) plus the trap star's outsized charisma (minus deadening conspicuous consumption) and furious delivery (<em>plus</em> rampant conspiracy theories). Monch knows it, too, neatly summarizing the dichotomy on ""What It Is"": ""They thought I was backpack/ Slept/ Didn't know that that he kept inside the knapsack...""</p><p>
    This sort of deft reversal characterizes Monch's lyrics (""Slave to a label, but I still own my masters,"" he spits on the title track), as does an existential and oblique approach to well-worn gunplay scenarios. Vocally, he's like a Yankee Ludacris, except that he peppers his durable, booming vernacular with showy clusters of tongue-twisting homophones. And like Nas in his prime, Monch combines several skill sets into a seamless package: A vivid narrative imagination and the control to bring it to life, a knack for dizzying extended metaphors and haymaker punchlines, and a complex moral sense.
    </p><p>
    Any given track on <em>Desire</em> displays one or two of these attributes-- ""Let's Go"" sustains a rhyme scheme built around the names of various handheld peripherals; the braggadocio-driven title track is full of wild puns like ""even if you were ashes you couldn't ""urn""-- but the best embody them all. In the epic, revenge-fantasy closer ""Trilogy"", a chorus comprised of Mr. Porter (in the funky first act), Dwele (in the elegiac second), and Tone (in the boom-bap third) provides narrative compression and interior monologue. ""Trilogy""'s fantastic pacing and its use of music as a storytelling supplement only adds to its high-wire tension. 
    </p>
<p>
    Monch might flounder into familiar indie territory if his music weren't so lucid and lively. He gives his backup singers and shapeshifting beats plenty of room to breathe, especially on the tracks he produced himself. On the anthemic ""Push"", he drops in for one climatic verse after a long gospel workout moistened by Tower of Power horns, and on ""Body Baby"", he forgoes his usual boom in favor of brisk syllabic shards that slot neatly into the music's juke-joint bounce. Producers like 99 Fingaz, Alchemist, and Detroit up-and-comer Black Milk give Monch the kind of extraterrestrial soul he's built for. The only duds are the genre exercises: The maddeningly insistent guitar noodles during the Public Enemy throwback ""Welcome to the Terrordome"" are a long way from the Bomb Squad's Prince-sampled shredding, while the disposable ""Bar Tap"" shows that club tracks aren't one of Monch's strong suits.
    </p>
<p>
    Monch also handled production on ""What it Is"", where conspiratorial whispers and an urgent synth monotone make the thread of paranoia running through the record sonically explicit. This conspiratorial bent, combined with the album's interludes (which range from civil-rights polemics, meditations on telekinesis, and a satire of Clear Channel-controlled FM radio), give it a recondite feel. Yet Monch's fantastical side is tempered by hyper-modern references to the Iraq war, stem cell research, Hurricane Katrina, and<em>, </em>in a clear moment of weakness, <em>Queer Eye for the Straight Guy</em>. His penchant for working hot-button topics into his rhyme schemes is so pronounced that you almost expect to hear about troop surges and colony collapse. 
    </p>
<p>
    The long wait for <em>Desire</em> is due largely to the Rawkus/Geffen debacle, and Monch isn't happy about it-- as on Clipse's <em>Hell Hath No Fury</em>, his frustration with being stuck in label-purgatory is apparent in pockets of the album. The first time he speaks, on the whammy-barred screed ""Push"", it's to liken the rap industry, with its ""choruses of cocaine, tales of black heat,"" to indentured servitude. ""Now switch that advance for your emancipation!"" This angry-prole stance pervades the album; Monch seems more concerned about labels fucking with his personal agency than his money. He doesn't take pride in wealth like cocaine rappers, nor does he take pride in poverty like their undie foils-- he seems more interested in specific self-definition than on picking a side in rap's culture war. At a time when a thread of unquestioning capitalist acquiescence runs through an otherwise lively and diverse rap climate, Monch's embattled anarchism isn't just refreshing, it's inspiring.

    Thomas Fehlmann's superb new album starts off in the middle of things, like
    it only reluctantly consented to be heard after the proceedings had begun. Its
    reluctance isn't a mark of ill will-- it's just that <em>Honigpumpe</em> doesn't
    really need you. Certain of its tracks would fit into communal rituals on a
    dance floor, but Fehlmann's work at this point, close to 20 years after he
    started working with electronic music in Berlin, sounds too assured and in
    thrall with itself to get worked up over questions it can't wholly account for.</p><p>
    That might prove a problem if <em>Honigpumpe</em> weren't so magnetic and
    warm. Both have long served as operative words for Fehlmann, from his formative
    days in the Orb (the epochal ambient-house group he still helps steer) to his
    current era on Kompakt. It's hard to imagine the label's vaunted limp-strut
    schaffel sound reaching the heights it did without Fehlmann's help, and it's
    easy to imagine the kind of historical buzz he brings to the wide-eyed house
    devotees in the Kompakt boardroom.</p><p>
    Like the Field's <em>From Here We Go Sublime</em>, a touchstone album it's
    sneakily better than, <em>Honigpumpe</em> traffics in mid-tempo electronic music
    that gulps and rolls. It takes a few tracks for the gulps to start: The album
    starts out in an ambient mood, with a gentle throb building through the first
    three tracks, before ""Schaum"" turns out the lights to focus on the
    glimmer of a disco ball set to spin. It's the kind of track a DJ might drop at
    the beginning of a set to announce his arrival with a portentous stir, and the
    fact that ""Schaum"" translates as ""foam"" won't surprise
    anyone with an ear for the billowing synth figures that that rise up from the
    hissy beat below.
    </p>
<p>
    It's when that hiss hits hardest that <em>Honigpumpe</em> finds its prime, in
    part because Fehlmann is so good at his brand of deep-focus production that
    even a banging beat skews as just one part of what's going on-- as a texture, a
    riff, a sign. To that end, ""Bienenkoenigin"" moves in time to a
    forceful techno march, with a mix of harsh metallic clangs and seething
    tambourines, but it also gets caught up in a playful mix of oompah pump that is
    anything but austere. Within the same track, you come to recognize one mood,
    then another, and yet another-- only to realize then that all had been there
    all along, lurking in the wrinkles that repetition smoothes.

    Fehlmann and the Field share an affinity for the principle of the changing
    same, with loops locked into place and left alone, but tracks here like
    ""T.R.N.T.T.F."" and ""100 Baeume""-- and others tucked within <em>Honigpumpe</em>'s
    majestic second half-- stare down their patterns with more drama and drive.
    They sound like they're looking for something instead of getting lost in their
    lids-- which, of course, makes it all the more easy to get lost in your own.

    Ibrahim Ferrer was literally born into music-- his mother gave birth to him
    at a dance in his hometown of San Luis, Cuba, in 1927. Orphaned at the age of
    12, he sold fruit and sang on the streets for money and ultimately found his
    way into bands that played in the nearby major city of Santiago. The region
    around Santiago is widely thought to be the home of the bolero song style, but
    Ferrer didn't sing boleros with the bands and dance orchestras he joined. The
    style remained in the back of his mind, though, through a career that took him
    to Havana, where his band Los Bocucos immortalized two of Cuba's great songs,
    ""De Camino a la Vereda"" and Faustino Oramas' classic composition
    ""Ay, Candela"", both uptempo son tunes miles removed from the sensual,
    slowly swaying rhythms and billowing melodies of the bolero.</p><p>
    ""Una Fuerza Immensa"", from 1977, was the only bolero in his
    catalog until his late-life resurrection with Buena Vista Social Club, where he
    finally got to put his naturally rich and expressive voice to work on one of
    the all-time great compositions of the form, ""Isolina Carillo's ""Dos
    Gardenias"". Looking back, it seems obvious that this man, who once
    accurately compared his own voice with the flavor of Eastern Cuban rum, should
    have had free reign to sing these songs all along.</p><p>
<em>Mi Sueño</em>, literally ""My Dream,"" is an entire album of
    boleros and contains Ferrer's final recordings, made in the years before his
    death in 2005. For a record that focuses so tightly on such a specific form,
    it's remarkably varied, giving his voice complete freedom to roam through the
    songs. It's the type of music I've come to appreciate a great deal more as I've
    grown older, free of pretense and just plain beautiful. Ferrer could have left
    no better goodbye to the world. 
    </p>
<p>
    It nearly didn't come out. Ferrer died in the midst of recording <em>Mi Sueño</em>,
    and it wasn't until after a clutch of well-recorded demos were hunted down that
    the whole album could be pieced together. Another song with fellow elder
    statesman Rubén González on piano, ""Melodias del Rio"", was added from
    a 1998 session with Ry Cooder, and the final tracklist runs by like a river of
    melody and languid, jazz-informed Cuban rhythm. 
    </p>
<p>
    So it's a dream fulfilled late, but thankfully the work was put in to see it
    through, as there are some amazing performances. ""Perfidia"" is
    stunning Cuban jazz, with expansive piano from co-producer Roberto Fonseca
    providing a deep, deep groove that Ferrer sinks right into. ""Cada Noche Un
    Amor"" nods to the James Bond theme, perhaps coincidentally, in its opening
    chords, and then dives into a Santiago slow burn, with Ferrer stretching out
    and just letting the song spill over the chords as the melody demands.
    Guitarist Manuel Galban, once the leader of vocal group Los Zafiros and long a
    personal favorite of mine, is right behind, trading intoxicating lead phrases
    with Fonseca. His brief solo is gorgeous. 
    </p>
<p>
    My favorite, though, is ""Copla Guajira"", where the tempo picks up
    a bit and Ferrer trades phrases with clarinetist Javier Zalbar. Galban lends
    his unmistakable, spindly leads, heightening the late night cool of the song.
    It's wonderful to hear musicians playing in such telepathic sympathy with each
    other in any context, but that this was a project that so clearly meant the
    world to Ferrer heightens the passion just that final bit more. Newcomers to
    Ferrer's music can't really go wrong with his Nonesuch output, and this is as
    wonderful a place to start as any, though those seeking a bit more history
    would be well advised to check his volume of Escondido's excellent <em>Cuban
    Essentials</em> series. For devotees of Cuban sounds, <em>Mi Sueño</em> is a dream
    come true in any language.

    Awarding
    praise or assigning blame with a band like Badgerlore is difficult: First,
    there's the group's slow, unsteady evolution. Badgerlore started in 1998 as a
    duo between former Deerhoof member Rob Fisk and Six Organs center Ben Chasny,
    the pair occasionally rendezvousing in California to record the fragments that
    comprise 2003's <em>Of Things Too Sorrowful to Be
    Mindful Of, Of Things Too Beautiful to Possess</em>. And, as if prescient
    of the tonal, torpid improvisations that have become Badgerlore's hallmark, the
    band has continued to build itself by deliberately stirring its own pot. For
    their second LP, <em>Songs for Owls</em>,<em> </em>Charalambides' Tom Carter and Yellow Swan
    Pete Swanson entered the mix. On <em>We Are All
    Hopeful Farmers, We Are All Scared Rabbits</em>, their third and most
    captivating work to date, Jewelled Antler Collective mainstay Glenn Donaldson
    falls into place alongside Grouper's Liz Harris.</p><p>
    The
    induction of two new members here emphasizes the difficulty of assessing
    something like Badgerlore too carefully. After all, Badgerlore's members are
    like the pseudopods of an amoeba, each doing his or her own thing without
    knowing where their actions will take them. By reaching out and shaping
    individual sounds with distinct but inherently related motions, the whole band
    stretches towards something unplanned and unknown. At <em>We Are All Hopeful</em>'s best, Carter, Chasny,
    Donaldson, Fisk, Harris and Swanson separately arrive at such a destination.</p><p>
    When
    that happens, Badgerlore can be mesmerizing. ""Crops That You Tend"",
    for instance, twists and snarls a banjo through sheets of inseparable guitar
    noise before unexpectedly releasing into a resplendent chorus, the voices
    lifting in ghostly, graceful arches above the resonator: ""Find the ones
    you love the most and hold them tight/ Find the ones you hate and hold them tight,""
    the hopeful farmers sing at a molasses creep, variations on the couplet cutting
    beneath one another. Or take the first seven minutes of opener
    ""Furbearer"", in which yawning guitars and basses build in tiny
    increments as sporadic vocal washes drift above them. It's an intentionally
    soporific lull-- hazy and sullen and gradual-- that finally coalesces into
    something bigger as if by accident: For 15 seconds, there's the flutter of an
    overpowering drone, the sounds of eight minutes' wandering funneled into one
    dark cloud. Then it's gone. 
    </p>
<p>
    These
    are risks Chasny and Fisk haven't taken together before now, and they're
    near-total payoffs. Previously, Badgerlore was sometimes crippled by a
    listlessness that still lingers in parts. Edits of jams reflected different
    slipstreams of consciousness that occasionally intersected through
    happenstance. <em>We Are All Hopeful </em>finds
    Badgerlore hearing ideas and pursuing them with forward motion. ""Grow Your
    Hair"", the album's late highlight, works counter to common Badgerlore knowledge,
    opening through a roar of clipped, unified guitars before falling off into near
    silence. It ultimately builds back into perhaps the most conventional structure
    in the band's catalogue-- coherent vocals, a regular guitar figure that kind of
    progresses, and instrumental dynamics that actually acknowledge structure. 
    </p>
<p>
    Though it's hard to say with certainty as he only contributed to one session for <em>We Are</em>, Donaldson-- credited only with banjo here-- seems to be a key catalyst and enabler, if only by influence. A founder
    of the Jewelled Antler Collective, he performs with acknowledgment of only his
    and his collaborators' expectations, running his own CD-R label and taking his
    various projects either into studios or beside riverbanks, a rolling tape
    documenting both settings. As a member of Blithe Sons, he's experimented with
    improvising around a core theme, but his work in the sprawling ensemble Thuja
    has acquainted him with pure improvisation, or building sounds and structures
    from ether, <em>en masse</em>. On <em>We Are All Hopeful</em>, Badgerlore seem in the spirit of Donaldson, even if Carter and Fisk were responsible for the bulk of these finished recordings.
    </p>
<p>
    It's
    important to know that this is just a personal best. Early Badgerlore
    recordings made it seem like Fisk and Chasny would happily sit in a room
    forever, recording whatever came to mind with friends, one microphone and a lot
    of whiskey in tow. They're still doing that, but, to their credit, they've
    taken more chances on <em>We Are All Hopeful</em>.
    Still, stacked against some of the accomplishments from Fluxus acolytes,
    several decades of international psychedelic music or-- closer to now-- the
    best from Matt Valentine's New England camp, Badgerlore still has plenty of
    space and texture to fill. But it's nice to know they've gotten this far.

    A compilation like this has been a long time coming. In
    1997, Holland-based DJ/producer I-F basically invented electroclash with his
    underground dance hit ""Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass"". Two years
    later, he helped catalyze the ongoing Italo-disco revival with one of the
    genre's most essential compilations, <em>Mixed Up in the Hague,
    Vol. 1</em>, a DJ mix that pulled together defining cuts like Mr. Flagio's
    vocoder-fronted ""Take a Chance"" and Klein &amp; MBO's ""Blue
    Monday""-influencing ""Dirty Talk"". Since then, other DJ mixes
    such as Morgan Geist's <em>Unclassics</em>
    have kept vintage Italo on turntables, while I-F's Italo-focused <a href=""http://www.cybernetic-broadcasting.net/home/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Cybernetic
    Broadcasting System</strong></a> has deepened the canon for real devotees.</p><p>
    2007 may be remembered in some circles for its dance-rock
    hybrids: Klaxons and Justice, ""nu rave"" and ""blog house,""
    each ably filling in for the dance-punk and electroclash of previous trend
    cycles. But it's also a year when significant numbers of contemporary artists
    have embraced Italo's Giorgio Moroder-styled synth arpeggios and brought them
    into the new millennium. Sweden's Sally Shapiro and Cloetta Paris are breathing new life into
    the wispy synth-pop of Italo singer Valerie Dore, while the UK's Kathy
    Diamond is making beardo synth-pop with producer Maurice Fulton. The
    enigmatic Black Devil Disco Club's <span style=""font-style: italic"">28 After</span> could've been made any time in the past 30 years. In the icy winter afterglow of Shapiro's <em>Disco Romance</em>, Portland, Ore.
    acts Glass Candy and Chromatics helped keep Pitchfork HQ's Italo love aflame
    with their first releases for Italians Do It Better, a new label
    from Troubleman Unlimited founder Mike Simonetti. <em>Viva Italia</em>.</p><p>
    On <em>After Dark</em>, the
    fledgling imprint assembles mostly vinyl-only or previously unreleased tracks by
    its current roster, which also includes Farah, Mirage, and Professor Genius.
    Produced in substantial part by Glass Candy guitarist Johnny Jewel, the
    comp is practically a <em>Mixed Up in the
    Hague</em> for present-day Italo, only with the darker ambiance its title
    implies. Where its precursor could at times play up Italo's proclivity for cheese
    (once experienced in the U.S.
    via minor Eurodisco hits by the likes of Falco and Taco), this album wisely
    eschews ironic winks and kitsch-for-kitsch's sake. Shapiro might find an indie pop romance in Italo,
    but <em>After Dark</em> lovingly re-imagines the
    style as retro-futurist noir-- a sleek soundtrack to lives of moral ambiguity in
    post-urban shadows. 
    </p>
<p>
    The best tracks on the compilation embody that eerie slant
    on the old Italo throb/pulse without letting an air of minor-key reflection
    lapse into air quotes. On the extended 12"" version of
    Chromatics' ""In the City"", the crackle of vinyl, distant synth swoops, skeletal drum patter, and singer Ruth
    Radelet's narcoticized murmurs about ""midnight workers"" and a
    ""concrete river"" evokes rain hitting sidewalks. Glass Candy's Italo coming-out, ""<strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/41865-glass-candy-i-always-say-yes-12-main-mp3"">I Always
    Say Yes</a></strong>"", is conspicuously absent, but their hazy
    ""Rolling Down the Hills (Spring Demo)"" opens the disc with horns and
    singer Ida No's deadly cold vocal presence. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>After Dark</em>'s other
    acts approach the compilation's dusky Italo aesthetic from similar perspectives. New
    Jersey-based Professor Genius homes in on the dystopian synth work of Vangelis
    and the upbeat expressiveness of Alexander Robotnick on instrumentals ""La
    Grotta (Demo)"" and album-closing ""Pegaso"". The vocoder makes its sole
    appearances on two tracks by Italy's
    Mirage (""Lady Operator"", ""Lake of Dreams""),
    but Mirage uses the instrument to enhance singer Julius' alienation, not to dish cheap
    nostalgic thrills. Texas-based Farah keep up the metronomic beats and analog
    cascades, but ""Dancing Girls (Suite 304 Demo)"" adds a section sung in
    Persian, while the spoken-word monologue of ""Law of Life"" sounds like a scripture reading from a church of the damned. It's one of the few
    moments on <em>After Dark</em> that seems
    stilted as much as reverent.
    </p>
<p>
    For plenty <em>more</em> reverence, look to the album's cover versions. Though
    occasionally distracting, <em>After Dark</em>'s
    updates of older compositions are good signposts: Glass Candy's relatively
    direct take on Kraftwerk's essential 1981 ""Computer Love"", or a
    lavishly orchestrated rendition of Paris-based Eurodisco group Belle Epoque's 1977
    ""Miss Broadway"" (later sampled by rapper Special Ed on 1990's ""Come
    On, Let's Move It""). Not quite a cover, but Mirage's remix of Indeep's 1982 classic ""Last Night a DJ Saved My Life"" adds evocative
    Italo synths to the original's spare, post-disco bass line and early hip-hop
    vocals.
    </p>
<p>
    In addition, both Glass Candy and Chromatics cover songs by ex-DNA
    member Robin Crutchfield's Dark Day, particularly suiting Glass Candy's shift from
    no-wave to disco. A tinny analog synth rotates through slight arpeggio
    variations without giving way to a shift in mood on Glass Candy's cover of ""The
    Chameleon"", haunted by suicide and unnamed attackers. The steady snare thwack
    and detached atmospherics on Chromatics' version of the catchy ""Hands in
    the Dark"" suggest Chromatics' MySpace quote-- ""Night
    Drive""-- fits them even better than it does Jan Hammer riffer Kavinsky's
    recent ""<a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/42997-kavinsky-testarossa-nightdrive""><strong>Testarossa Nightdrive</strong></a>"", though here it's surely a drive headed
    toward despair.
    </p>
<p>
    So there it is: Italo survived electroclash. And the recent explosion of
    Italo disco-inspired acts culminating (for now) in <em>After
    Dark</em> probably suggests the style will survive current indie-dance trends as
    well. In an interview for Australia's <em>Rave
    Magazine</em>, Simian Mobile Disco's James Ford (who produced the latest
    releases by Klaxons and Arctic Monkeys) says of his own dance-pop outfit's
    swooning single ""<strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/43235-simian-mobile-disco-i-believe"">I Believe</a></strong>"": ""We've been getting into loads of
    slow, dreamy disco stuff-- the Emperor Machine, and a pair of bands in
    particular called Chromatics and Glass Candy-- and it partly came about like
    that."" Just don't look for Justice to follow suit quite yet.

    Playtime, amongst other things: Aside from the possibility of doing some by-request production jobs and mentoring younger artists, Wiley was originally planning on retiring from the grime scene after this album. Yeah, I know, rap retirements-- but he's gone through a lot of shit, whether recent (the fumbled pop-crossover of his Roll Deep crew's 2005 album <em>In at the Deep End</em>) or longstanding (""I'm getting threats but it's never stopped in 10 years,"" he told <em>RWD</em> Magazine during his ""farewell"" interview). Considering he had a beef at some point with almost everyone who appeared on <em>Run the Road</em> and is approaching 30 with a baby daughter in tow, the urge to step into the background is an understandable one-- even if there's little indication on his supposed last album that he's had it on his mind.<br/>
<em><br/>
    Playtime Is Over</em> caps off Wiley's career in a low-profile fashion, considering that the progression he's taken since he dropped the ""Eskimo"" riddim on an unsuspecting underground in 2002 can be measured in inches. While Dizzee Rascal took a few risky chances on switching up and Americanizing his style for <em>Maths + English</em>-- released, significantly enough, the same day as <em>Playtime Is Over</em> in the UK-- Wiley has kept his formula mostly intact: skittering, hiccuping bounce rhythms, synths that sound like a turbocharged Super Nintendo with a subwoofer attached, and a manic, borderline-toasting flow that plows through everything in its path.</p><p>
    Wiley's deficiencies as an MC aren't overwhelming, but the possibility that his retirement may just consist of him stepping away from the mic while continuing to produce seems like a decent outcome. His voice is a hell of an instrument in itself, a ragga-inflected string of serrated, lightning-quick jabs, but it spends a little too much time barreling over beats like they're suggestions instead of backbones. Opener ""50/50"" is a sharp bit of lyrical work, wrapping a few tight phrases around a titular term that typically wouldn't give much room for them (""I'm 50/50, nifty nifty/ Got the best deal, nobody can twist me/ Anytime somebody tries to shoot me/ I flip the ball they miss me, miss me""), but by the second verse he's dropping syllables off-rhythm and his inflections fight distractingly against the beat.</p><p>
    ""Gangsters"" (one of three tracks carried over from 2006's self-released <em>Da 2nd Phaze</em>) is a loosely-associated string of threats and observations with only one word-- an icy, synthetic female voice echoing ""gangsters""-- holding his verses together, and technically there isn't even really much rhyming involved: ""We just had a wave of new (gangsters)/ Yeah, I think there's been a rise, more (gangsters)/ Imagine that, I'm a street kid brainy like (gangsters),"" and so forth. It's weird that someone with such a straightforward lyrical style is so frequently thrown off by his own beats, but after hearing ""Bow E3""-- where Wiley's postal-code hood-rep is halfway submerged under Maniac's production and constantly undercut by a stuttering, omnipresent hook-- you begin to miss how his voice sounds, flaws and all, when it has breathing room.</p><p>
    And there's a couple tracks where he gives himself plenty of it, often with some uncharacteristically gentle touches. ""Baby Girl"" is the most notable example, a dedication to his daughter that tempers his typical gruffness with a soothing flute/Mellotron loop and paternally poignant lyrics about teaching her the music business when she grows up. ""Letter 2 Dizzee"" is the other standout moment of raw feeling, where his side of the beef with his onetime protégé is played out with more wistfulness and disappointment than straight-up fury, reminiscing about coming up in the business together and couching a tentative ceasefire in shit-talking lingo: ""Nothin' ain't changed except I'm the best now/ It don't matter, I'm still your big brother."" (Given how calm and reconciliatory he sounds, it's probable he cut this before Dizzee's alleged Wiley dis ""Pussyole (Oldskool)"" dropped.)</p><p>
    Still, Wiley's always been strongest as a producer, arguably as important to the rhythmic aspect of grime's development as Dizzee was to the vocal. Even if there's little here that's surprising to anyone who heard 2004's <em>Treddin' on Thin Ice</em>, there's no sign of any creative entropy behind the boards; the Castlevania creep of ""Johnny Was a Bad Boy"", the elbow-throwing conga line of ""Eski-Boy"" and the electro tinges in ""No Qualms"" round out an album that's varied enough to serve as a solid final mission statement. And the guest spots featuring young, ambitious up-and-comers like Scorcher (who sounds like Wiley's smoother-voiced doppelganger on ""Flyboy"") and Jukie Mundo (growling like a rudeboy version of M.O.P. on ""Stars"") could serve as a preview for what Wiley's post-""retirement"" mentorship itinerary might involve down the road-- dense, precise beats with intricately flexible drum programming, fronted by a new generation of grime torchbearers. 
    </p>
<p>
    But suitably enough, the best beat on this album is on the final hidden track: Like his name-making ""Eskimo"", it's an instrumental with icy electronics and elastic bass, but it's also got a massive rhythm built on Lennox Lewis-force handclaps and a loose-limbed tempo that smoothly shifts gears from an off-center grime rhythm to a pounding, pseudo-house 4/4 for roughly seven seconds, just because it can. The bonus track's name: ""Where's Wiley"". Hopefully not a question we'll have to ask two years from now.<br/>

    As part of his ""Promiscuous Materials"" project, author (and EMP conference keynote presenter) Jonathan Lethem made available on his website the lyrics to several partially completed songs he'd been stowing away for the past 20 years, for musicians to adapt however they liked.  Boston sextet Hallelujah the Hills took the scant text of Lethem's ""Monster Eyes"" (""Can you feel my eyes abhor you?/ Better run, better run"") and turned it into a somewhat creepy lo-fi dirge, debuting the completed song at Coolidge Corner Theatre in Brookline, Mass.</p><p>
    The collaboration was a fitting first foray into the public eye for HtH, whose debut album <em>Collective Psychosis Begone</em>  reveals a group clearly inclined toward the bookish end of the musical spectrum. A verse-ending lyric from the breathlessly delivered ""fight song"" that doubles as the band's name underscores its academic accent: ""made inventions, broke conventions/ Raised a glass to new pretensions/ meta-meta-meta-and the novel is dead. Literary existentialism aside, ""HtH"" (the song)'s exuberant horns and strings combine with its reference-desk references to position HtH (the band) in the Venn diagram overlap between the two most currently prominent strains of Anglo-ethnic indie rock.  The band's ensemble structure (cello, trumpet, and melodica) and learned lyricism echoes the stage-packing sounds of Arcade Fire, Danielson, Bright Eyes, and Decemberists, while its shambolic, maximalist barroom aura recalls Robert Pollard, another songwriter infrequently at a loss for words.</p><p>
    Anyone even slightly familiar with Pollard will recognize his influence on Ryan Walsh's songwriting.  The lyric ""let's all plug in to the telepathic disco,"" which feels traced from Pollard's handbook of power-pop processionals, marks a minor crescendo in album-opener ""Sleeper Agent""; triggering strings to swell, a gang of voices to appear, and temporarily expanding the song into a barroom singalong, perhaps for a pub full of creative writing majors just finished with finals.  It gives way to what is easily the album's best song; the irresistable ""Wave Backward to Massachusetts"".  Feeling like an excerpt from <em>Alien Lanes</em> or <em>Under the Bushes, Under the Stars</em>, ""Wave"" exhibits Walsh's similar (if not quite as ingratiating) knack for crafting fist-pumping anthems from absurdist word clusters.  Don't think he's unaware of this, either: on its way toward yet another raved-up, string-laden ending, slow-burner ""The House Is All Lit Up"" offers that ""non-sequiturs built this nation.""
    </p>
<p>
    While never again reaching the giddy level of ""Wave"", <em>Collective</em> does tackle a wide variety of subject matter.  ""Effie's On the Other Side"" is the most melodic morgue-robbing tale you'll hear all year, and the Golden Age ode ""It's All Been Downhill Since the Talkies Started to Sing"" sets a film-studies fever dream atop fuzzed-out guitar.  The extended freak-out coda sticks around for about two minutes too long; like Pollard and so many college seminar papers, <em>Collective</em> could use an editor in places (the song titles, perhaps, and the over-used horns), and at times comes across as a collection of citations without a balance of original vision.   As a first draft of Hallelujah the Hills' future potential, however, it's   definitely worth a bit of polish.

    Tells</em>, their 2006 debut for Saddle Creek, included ""Long Summer Day"",
    a song written from the perspective of a slave, which raised issues of
    racism and misappropriation, including from Pitchfork reviewer Brian Howe.
    Then, while playing a show last fall in Houston, the San Francisco duo had an
    unfortunate run-in with the police that ended in violence and arrest.
    Their ultimately triumphant legal battles and hectic tour schedule left Adam Stephens and Tyson
    Vogel little time to craft a proper full-length (one is due out in
    September), so in the meantime they've recorded some acoustic tracks at sound checks and
    radio appearances.</p><p>
<em>
    The Scenery of Farewell</em> is a different direction for the
    usually raucous TG, who've earned comparisons to a Southern
    White Stripes or an American Pogues by dragging ratty garage-punk
    through the muddy country. Instead, their more intimate, stripped-down
    approach (including flourishes of piano and various string instruments
    like cello, double, bass, and violin) likens them more to roots
    rockers like the Jayhawks and the Avett Brothers, along with nods to
    acoustic Neil Young and the Band.</p><p>
    Many of the EP's themes are about life on the road, alienation, and
    loneliness, the struggle to keep long distance (geographical and
    emotional) relationships going and when to say goodbye to them. String-drenched opener ""Seems Like Home to Me"" is a weary lament
    about a woman with oceans for eyes. ""Lady"" goes ""where the hobos sleep""
    and admits to ""count[ing] my thoughts with coffee spoons."" The strings
    and harmonicas of ""Up the Country"" lament, ""I've seen salvation's yard
    but every highwayman's been barred."" ""All Your Faithless Loyalties""
    is an early Dylan-styled kiss-off akin to ""It Ain't Me Babe"". With the
    piano ballad closer, ""Linger"", it's hard to tell if they are men in
    love or men at war. Love is a battlefield, after all.
    </p><p>
    While the intimate settings give Two Gallants a different palette for
    themselves and their fans, as well as a spotlight on their literate
    lyrics, the songs are a little too similar sounding. <em>The Scenery
    of Farewell</em> is a decent lazy summer listen, but it doesn't leave a lasting
    impression and is probably not enough to convert anyone who isn't
    already a fan. In turning down the volume, the band
    loses much of its unique personality, love it or hate it.

    Last year, Berlin-based producer Andrew Pekler toured with Jan Jelinek as
    part of the Kosmischer Pitch band. He's been making music under several names
    for almost a decade, first gaining notice in 2000 as Sad Rockets,
    releasing <em>Transition</em> on Matador when the label experimented frequently
    with electronic releases. Though he's not prolific by the standards of
    electronic music, Pekler's method reminds me a bit of Atom Heart or Burnt
    Friedmann: each record is meant to sound different, based on a considered set
    of aesthetic guidelines. Pekler's time hanging around Jelinek-- after having
    previously been his labelmate on ~scape-- seems particularly significant here
    on his latest record.</p><p>
    For <em>Cue</em>, Pekler's M.O. was to assemble music using
    ""library"" records as inspiration. These are those weird LPs you
    now sometimes find in the ""Misc."" section of record stores,
    containing music for royalty-free ""needle drop"" use in commercial
    applications. Pekler took descriptions of the intended effect for various
    tracks (""slow, ominous piano motif drifting into swirling
    atmosphere""), and built new tracks, attempting to arrive at
    these moods from another angle.</p><p>
    Knowledge of his process is unnecessary for enjoying <em>Cue</em>. Pekler's
    use of such sterile material certainly contributes to the record's
    unusually disjointed feel, but these tracks don't seem tied to any particular
    era and certainly aren't meant for background use. His fondness for dense,
    overlapping loops as the basic unit of composition does, however, resemble the
    direction Jelinek has taken on his last two records, <em>Kosmischer Pitch</em>
    and <em>Tierbeobachtungen</em>. Each of these tracks sounds build from five or
    six or ten samples that are cut into pieces, set in motion, and allowed to bump
    into each other.
    </p>
<p>
    This approach, while necessarily limited in terms of dynamics, results in a
    handful of very interesting tracks. ""Rockslide"" even edges toward
    brilliant, with a droning tone up front that seems to skim along the surface of
    the beat like a stone across water, its pitch bent into chord-like shapes that,
    heard over steady floor toms, even manage to get a pretty funky. Indeed, the
    sound of drums throughout is striking and weird in a good way-- the
    extreme aridity of the beats opening ""On"" is the sort of thing Steve
    Albini hears in his dreams, and the exceptionally spacious ""Pensive
    Boogie"" sounds like a sack of assorted percussion tumbling down the stairs
    in slow motion, with some of the sounds moving backwards. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Vertical Gardens"" is one of the places where the samples show
    their age, the cheap synth outlining the chords evoking early electronics
    nostalgia in a manner reminiscent of the bubbly, bright electro-pop of
    Schlammpeitziger, but with an additional layer of abstraction.
    ""Mote"", one of a few short interludes that take one idea and runs
    with it for a minute or two, gets a lot of mileage from some cut-up piano bits,
    sounding like a player piano with a shredded roll that has been left alone in a
    decaying ballroom.
    </p>
    All
    in all, <em>Cue </em>is very subtle. Aside from ""Rockslide"", none of
    the tracks leaps out and demands to be regarded, despite the widely varying use
    of textures, tempos, and layering. But it's the sort of record that gets more
    interesting the deeper you get inside, as its old and strangely disembodied
    samples assemble into something new and occasionally even fleshy.</div>"|10358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10358-cue/|7.1|Mark Richardson

Simian Mobile Disco were as deep in rock as a pair of quarrymen, even if you'd never know it to listen to this record. James Ford and James Shaw got their start in workman-like indie four-piece Simian, lost to the discount bins had SMD not branched sideways into success in the populist end of dance. That success first came with Justice's remix of Simian's ""Never Be Alone"" (titled ""We Are Your Friends""), released on Ed Banger-- a label which, for many people, might as well be a rock imprint. And as a production team, SMD did the rock remix thing and helmed the debut album from neon enthusiasts and indie rock serial daters the Klaxons.</p><p>
    But <em>Myths of the Near Future</em> was, even accounting for taste, a tinny din. It was the sound of its producers trying to futilely collate the rapid-fire ideas of a young band without the taste or craft to execute them without it sounding like a drunken bar fight. And Justice wields dance music as if fending off zombie attackers at the DJ booth. Meanwhile, SMD's excellent debut album as a stand-alone group, <em>Attack Decay Sustain Release</em>, is for dancing, not moshing-- especially if that's dancing in front of your bedroom mirror to the radio, like Tony Manero, primping before hitting the town.</p><p>
    What makes SMD a better <em>pop</em> band than Justice or the Klaxons is their commitment to clean danceable beats (the electro arpeggios of ""Sleep Deprivation"" clang as loudly and brightly as a Max Martin production) and lighthearted and immediate hooks (""Hot Dog"" turns robotized double-dutch taunts, motor-revving bass, and stampeding drums into the rollerskate chant the last Rapture album couldn't quite reach). But what really sells <em>Attack Decay Sustain Release</em> is Simian Mobile Disco's unerring devotion to always-hooky pastiche in the name of a good time, and to pop's unbreakable formalism when it comes to things like track length and the need for a kick-ass chorus.
    </p><p>
    Justice and the Klaxons are pastiche artists, too, but SMD's vision is friendlier, scornful of ""weren't the '80s <em>wacky</em>"" irony, with their ears wide open to such less-than-punk sounds as Bobby O's hi-NRG, Information Society's pure energy, Sweet Sensation's freefalling freestyle, and every lite-brite shade of pop-house and techno in the spectrum. ""It's the Beat"" falls over itself combining all of the above plus a New Order morse code bleep, a numerical-minded Kraftwerk squelch-melody, a Technotronic fanfare riff, and a rap from a Go! Teamer who wants to be Roxanne Shante. And forget rock, except for maybe the martial tempos, because there's nothing aggressive (read: ""overly masculine"") about SMD's mix, and nothing purposefully ugly, either. ""I Believe"" and ""Love"" both shamelessly borrow the classic big-fey-voice-over-booming-synth dynamics of Depeche Mode at their most pop and Erasure at their most soulful. 
    </p>
<p>
    For SMD, electronic music begins and ends with the radio, from Soft Cell to Crystal Waters, and so its over-the-top friendliness, immediacy, and excitement has a cramped, amped-up hysteria, like all great bubblegum. (It's also <em>short</em> like a bubblegum album-- 10 tracks in under 40 minutes, most songs being perfect A-side lengths for seven-inch singles.) And even as prototypical indie kid pop-cultural curators-- who else is so into old bubblegum sounds?-- SMD's knock-out craft just might win them a wide American audience. After all, another indie pop duo (who used to record for Stereolab's label!) went on to become one of the top-shelf post-rave pastiche pop acts <em>and</em> to sell out arena crowds. And if SMD aren't quite Daft Punk, <em>Attack Decay Sustain Release</em> is a good sign that their <em>Discovery</em> might be right around the corner.

    History has been kind to J. Swinscoe. Despite a five-year drought, his downtempo jazz outfit Cinematic Orchestra has maintained a level of after-the-fact credibility that perceived contemporaries like Nightmares on Wax, Lamb, and Skalpel would probably kill for in 2007. It's true that with the benefit of hindsight, a lot of the stuff from that early noughties post trip-hop milieu doesn't sound nearly as moony or as luxuriant as it once did. For better or worse, that general blueprint (loping rhythms, swooshy atmospherics, stirring strings, trembling female vocals) never managed to transcend the stereotype of being nothing more than a sonic duvet for the gentrifying frontlines; no wonder that as scenes went, it evaporated faster than you could spell ""Café Del Mar"".</p><p>
    But thanks mostly to 2002's superb <em>Every Day</em>, Cinematic Orchestra escaped that era pretty much intact. Where most of their contemporaries scored easy points by merging Hallmark-style sentimentality with wiffly atmospherics, Cinematic always seemed to aim higher, recruiting gnarled instrumental veterans, drawing deep from jazz, and making records that felt more like expansive, carefully constructed suites than collections of songs.</p><p>
    All of which is reason enough to be a little bit offput by Swinscoe's new direction. His first full-length since <em>Every Day</em>, <em>Ma Fleur</em> abandons the light touch of his prior efforts in favor of an almost aggressively pretty approach. Where Swinscoe's early records were coy slow-burners that captivated over time, <em>Ma Fleur</em> leaves no room for subtlety. From the lonely, pregnant piano chords that open the record to the spiraling strings that close it, this is instructively momentous music, a conveyor belt of carefully delineated deep sighs, thoughtful sounds and big moments. </p><p>
    If it all sounds a little too rich, well, it can be. The good news is that some of the songs do merit their lavish surroundings. With a monochromatic piano line and guest vocals from an androgynous-sounding Patrick Watson, opener ""To Build a Home"" is a candlelit ballad that bears more than a passing resemblance to Antony's work. Despite its beauty (or maybe because of it), it also establishes a stultifying air that the album never really shakes itself free of.  Sometimes, as with the gently fingerpicked ""Music Box"", the shimmering and stately ""As the Stars Fall Into You"" and the quietly explosive ""Breathe"", it's a look that serves Swinscoe well. But by the time he breaks the pindrop silence with a creeping string coda for what feels like the ninetieth instance in 35 minutes, you might find yourself wishing this particular ride had more than two gears, or at least that one of those two gears wasn't 'park'.</p><p>
    Sadly, there's nothing here that approaches <em>Every Day</em>'s most spine-tingling moment-- the Roots Manuva-aided ""All Things to All Men"". If <em>Ma Fleur</em> is any indication, Swinscoe isn't particularly interested in evincing those kinds of thrills anymore, and that's a shame, because records that try to do what he's doing here are a hell of a lot easier to come by. Slow, sugary, and perhaps a little too safe, this is not quite the return that Cinematic fans will want it to be.<br/>

The devil tells him that he has three choices as to where he'll spend his eternal damnation. The devil opens a door, behind which people writhe in perpetual flames. ""No way,"" says the guy. The devil opens another door, behind which people convulse on an electrified floor. ""Uh-uh,"" says the guy. The devil opens a third door. Behind it, people are buried to their necks in excrement, each sipping a cup of tea with one free hand. ""Well, beats the other two,"" says the guy. ""I'll take it."" He eases into the filth, and just as he takes his first sip of tea, a voice comes over Hell's intercom: ""Okay everybody, tea break's over-- back on your heads!""</p><p>
    The joke, like most, masks multiple profundities-- that we all create our own Hells, that none of our vaunted free will or personal agency will keep us from our final reward, and that poo is funny. But while most of us choose one Hell, Oxbow's Eugene Robinson is in the unique position of residing simultaneously in all three. A slab of lurid and tattooed muscle, often near-nude, Robinson strikes a fearsome presence at Oxbow shows, seeming to writhe as if burned and shudder as if electrocuted at once. (This is a guy who out-scaried Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart on his own song, a harrowing cover of ""Saturn"".) And given his gibbering delivery and nihilistic lyrics, which always seem unhealthily scatological even when they don't deal specifically with shit, he would probably be quite comfy in the third room of Hell, especially were the tea replaced with something more potent: embalming fluid, perhaps, or bleach.</p><p>
    Oxbow have been a metal band, one steadily moving into more credibly frightening territory. At this point, one can scarcely identify them with traditional metal's canned, often hokey menace, as <em>The Narcotic Story</em> fully embraces a sort of slow-burning, infernal blues. It's a malign transmission, sparser than Oxbow's more metallic styles, and, paradoxically, much heavier. After establishing its extreme poles with a brief intro of piercing ambient tones and heavy-bowelled bleats, <em>The Narcotic Story</em> sustains a deft balance between creeping dirges and panicky rock for its duration. Its evocative disorder is remindful of U.S. Maple, and Robinson's blood-curdling polecat yowl recalls David Yow and the Frogs in equal measure.
    </p><p>
    ""Geometry of Business"" is a raw-boned, blowsy blues with fuzz bass bombs and creeping pianos-- the lyrics, as elsewhere on the album, are mostly, mercifully, unintelligible. Through repeated false starts, the noodly quiet of ""Time Gentlemen Time"" arduously erupts into a sturdy rock slog, shrill tones rising up from the wrecked chords and howled imprecations. By the time the crusty blues-metal swagger of ""Down a Stair Backward"" bleeds into the orchestral butt-jazz of ""She's a Find"", it's clear that Oxbow's usual laddering plod is doubled in effect by the more elegant, tension-building passages that they've stitched, Frankenstein's-monster-style, into it. Every piano-laced tea break is cut short by a sulfurous blare, and then it's back onto our heads, back into Robinson's world of shit.

Even more than other potentially forbidding 2007 dance music sub-genres like minimal techno-- paired down to its ultra-serious essentials but at least always mutating along some new and/or interesting axis-- jungle long ago stopped moving for anyone not already down with the program. Offshore releases, then, are excellent points of entry not only because they're more inventive than most 21st century drum'n'bass (techno-tinged percussion that splits the difference between groove and experimentalism) but because they're friendly (which in this case just as often means they're pretty rather than catchy). They're a fresh take on the genre that also remembers you once listened to jungle to hear otherworldly sounds as well as rhythms that rewrote your working definition of ""funk"" with each new 12-inch.</p><p>
    The first official Offshore CD release since 2004's <em>Troubled Waters</em> mix CD, the 10 rarities and exclusives collected on <em>Buried Treasure</em> are an obvious way ""in."" Still, there are a few things you need to enjoy before bothering to venture into the modern-day jungle. A love of rapid-fire, jittery syncopations is key to enjoying a track like Graphic's ""Stop Motion"" which, true to its name, is speedier than any techno track you're currently enjoying and stops and starts like a city bus. Looped grooves and the layered interplay between different loops should sound appealing, too; ""Stop Motion"" is all about the dizzying ways Graphic trades off between a handful crunchy, choppy drum breaks, weaving in a smear of grumbling bass, the ping of an elevator reaching its floor, and a wobbly organ motif.</p><p>
    But mostly you've got to love drums. Whether it's the way Graphic and Slide push the frantic kicks and snares of ""Crash Kit"" through various EQ settings until they clonk like metal or clink like glass or how Fanu drives his very naturalistic-sounding blaxsploitation beats into a Cerberus-snarling hell ride on ""Defunct Drums' Depression Decade VIP,"" if tightened and twisted drum breaks for their own sake don't immediately get your nose open, <em>Buried Treasure</em> might take a couple spins to immerse yourself in. But one track that will spin everyone's head around on the first play is Sileni's VIP remix of his own ""Twitchy Droid Leg"", easily the most rhythmically complex four minutes you'll hear in 2007. (""Finally,"" a friend said after hearing it for the first time, ""your love of math-rock and your love of drum'n'bass are joined."") The original was the highlight of <em>Troubled Waters</em>, a two-stepping, timbrally-fucked robot rocker that ka-thunked and whirred like southern hip-hop gone horribly wrong.</p><p>
    Here, as lunar, bell-like synth tones (shades of early Aphex Twin) slur a melody in the background, Sileni seems to craft funky beats more like he's Matmos recording liposuction and other distressing bodily noises. Even though close-listeners can follow a syncopated pattern throughout ""Twitchy Droid Leg VIP"", it hits you as a riot of squishy squelches and groaning gurgles and Jabba the Hutt slurps. As the track progresses, spasming jazz drums try to kick their way out of the mucous-encrusted sonorities of Sileni's ""motherfucking robotic bounce tweaker beats."" For a genre that's so often stiff to the point of rigor mortis, Chris Leamy makes organic drum'n'bass that's more ""internal organs"" than stand-up bass and totally original. Why isn't this guy, like, hugely famous already? Somebody get <em>The Wire</em> magazine on the phone--or <em>Wired</em>, for that matter.</p></div>"|10325.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10325-buried-treasure/|7.0|Jess Harvell

    Bottom of the Hudson was once primarily a one-man band, releasing two patchwork demo-sounding albums before
    pulling together the effortlessly great and unfortunately overlooked <em>Holiday
    Machine</em> EP in 2005. That record was steeped in both the proud melodies and personal
    intimacy of 1990s indie, treading that balance easily thanks to the
    clean lo-fi aesthetic of bedroom auteur Eli Simon. In reviewing that EP for
    Pitchfork, I belabored a comparison between BOTH and Guided by Voices, which
    wasn't completely fair; it's not like they're the only two bands with equal
    affinity towards lo-fi recording and the British Invasion. They're
    both rare in how well they can balance the two, however, and <em>Fantastic
    Hawk</em> shows that and more. It's an album of simple, irresistible melodies
    and slow, subtle crescendos and insinuations that earn the band's occasional
    grand gestures.</p><p>
    While <em>Fantastic
    Hawk</em> makes use of a real studio, Simon's best songs transcend however
    they may be recorded. ""Pretty Much It"" exemplifies his ability for laconic
    vocal melodies that tug on the ears and pull us in like a familiar scent.
    ""Perfect Distillation"" (a phrase you'll likely only read in record
    reviews) builds slowly and cautiously to its perky, note-perfect chorus, while the
    ascending guitars on the sneaky coda of ""Suffering Time"" are cannily
    constructed and immaculately delivered. So there's tracks that would sound
    great in any setting, and tracks that meet new sounds halfway, like the
    woodwinds that pop up in the final moments of ""Fantastic Hawk"" or the
    Elvrum-like acoustic scrape of ""Rusty Zippers"", which puts all the burden
    on Simon's arresting vocal regardless of the oboes and zithers that garnish it.</p><p>
    There are also songs that, given the new studio treatment, should hit harder than
    they do: The raining marimbas and insistent guitar chug of ""Bee Hive""
    cry out for top-down highway drives, but its strangely demure rhythm section keeps
    it stuck somewhere between intimacy and grandeur. ""Over Engineered""
    is an overcooked lighter lifter with sheets of underwhelming shoegaze-stolen static. ""Cemetary Gates"" in particular punches
    at the walls of the band's limitations. From the staccato fake-out drums to the
    skittering drum pads, experimental and scattered under Simon's gift for
    traditional songwriting, its potential shines through while still begging for a
    more sympathetic producer.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, as with the case
    with many of our favorite lo-fi bands (including the aforementioned GBV), we
    tend to love them during their formative years and turn on them when they get
    access to real studios and recording budgets. Fickle, maybe, and not something
    to accurately level at BOTH, but maybe we love not only these bands' tunes but
    their potential, embracing their would-be classics in their roughened state
    while believing they'd conquer the world if given a chance. Bottom of the Hudson deserve more than
    their small, fervent following, but while <em>Fantastic Hawk</em> has
    plenty of new sounds and strong moments, it seems to lack that world-conquering

For a group who made their entrance with the autobiographical origin story ""Formed a Band"", the pledge that ""it's not irony, it's not rock'n'roll,"" and a humble and brash sound meant more to buttress singer Eddie Argos' wry observations than draw attention, landmines for a ""mature"" follow-up are everywhere. Change the lyrical approach to sober up the honest and clever self-indulgence, and you forfeit the angle that makes Art Brut unique and lovable. Pretty up the music too much, and you distract from and compromise Argos' regular-dude frontman bit. Merely remake <em>Bang Bang Rock N' Roll</em>, and risk the accusation that the band's concept was only good for one 30-minute shot, sentencing the group to the cult-band one-and-done footnotes. No wonder the second album is called <em>It's a Bit Complicated</em>.</p><p>
    Perhaps aware of this foreboding obstacle course, Art Brut have wisely managed to somehow make all of these mistakes and none of them, incrementally expanding their sonic palette while Argos evinces a slightly more grown-up perspective, yet never straying too far from the band's original M.O. Sure, there's a more muscular lead-guitar on most tracks here, they've discovered the joys of audible backing vocals, and a horn section even turns up on ""Late Sunday Evening"", but there aren't any ill-advised dalliances with laptop beats or orchestration or even, god forbid, ballads. Meanwhile, Argos' muse has perceptibly changed from ""gee-golly, I'm in a band!"" and bedroom performance anxiety to domestic living and the simple joy of music-listening without blunting his wit or giving in to the temptation to talk about fame and touring.</p><p>
    The subtle shift is apparent from the very start, as ""Pump Up the Volume"" hangs on a lead riff and an almost-solo more upfront than anything on <em>Bang Bang</em>, albeit far too slowly played to register as overly flashy. Meanwhile, the vocal is classic Argos, amplifying the dilemma of mid-makeout radio adjustment to epic proportions, interrupting a kiss to tentatively ask ""have you heard this song before?"" Sexxing is, in fact, on Argos' mind throughout the record, from the courtship drama of ""Direct Hit"" to stay-in-bed-baby pleadings of ""Blame It on the Trains"". ""Jealous Guy"" is even the polar opposite of the last record's slightly uncomfortable impotence trilogy, finding the singer pleading with his sleepy girlfriend to stay up and frolic while torturing himself with paranoia about her exes.
    </p><p>
    But more effective than these romantic ruminations are the tracks where Art Brut switches up their meta-aware music-about-music tendencies for the better, progressing from songs about making songs to songs about the irresistible urge to build a soundtrack to one's own life. In a way, ""Pump Up the Volume"" fits this category as well; if nothing else, it's about wanting to enhance an already, er, stimulating experience with the proper audio accompaniment. ""Sound of Summer"" is even more direct, fetishizing the process of creating the perfect mixtape in painstaking detail, right down to breaking the tabs ""so you can't tape over it ever."" The zenith of this subject is clearly reached on ""Nag Nag Nag Nag"", the band's between-albums single that amps up the central riff and sun-bleached backing vocals to make the song's dead-on coming-of-age headphones drama properly triumphant.
    </p>
<p>
    The upgrades in production values aren't always an improvement, however, as it occasionally comes at the sacrifice of the band's scrupulous spontaneity. Argos' self-aware humor is still present-- pronouncing ""here comes the really good bit!"" in the breakdown of ""Direct Hit"" or apologizing for his Germ-glish (""punk rock is nicht tot"") in ""St. Pauli""-- but doesn't produce as many banner-waving one-liners. Moments like ""People in Love"" and ""Post Soothing Out"" are more demure than anything found on the group's debut, and embellishments like the horn breakdown of ""Late Sunday Evening"" are a poor substitute for the homegrown fist-pump peaks of older tracks like ""Emily Kane"" and ""Modern Art"". 
    </p>
<p>
    These missteps are testament to Art Brut's hidden element: the band itself. While Argos draws the spotlight of most reviews (this one included), the rest of the band quietly adds its own crucial element, which at its best is a simple, raucous sound perfect for underscoring melodramatic tales of sex and rock. As ""St. Pauli"" nervously reflects, Art Brut are at heart a throwback punk band-- albeit one with a frontman that is far more charming, thoughtful, and witty than your typical three-chord bashers-- and two albums down, they're already bumping up against the constraints of that genre. By only gently nudging the musical formula on <em>It's a Bit Complicated</em>, Art Brut have succeeded in crafting a satisfying half-mature sequel, but may have only delayed, rather than thwarted, the sophomore jinx.

    It shouldn't have worked. And maybe, in 2003, it didn't: When a series of through-the-mail beat trades between Madlib and Jay Dee eventually coalesced into a full-length collaboration, the final result felt a little gimmicky at first. A pair of producer/MCs taking turns rhyming over each others' beats is unconventional enough, but when both of them had such disparate approaches at the time-- ever try listening to Jay Dee's smooth, uncluttered banger <em>Welcome to Detroit</em> and Quasimoto's blunted, dubbed-out <em>The Unseen</em> back to back, much less shuffled together?-- it was hard not to feel initially disoriented. Many critics (this one included) originally saw it as an enjoyable if disjointed effort, then eventually forgot about it once <em>Madvillainy </em>dropped a few months later.</p><p>
    Stones Throw's reissue of <em>Champion Sound</em>, then, seems to work largely as a ""hey, remember this?"" nudge, coming off the heels of the recent deluxe edition of Dilla's <em>Ruff Draft</em> EP in a similar bid to reestablish the value of an underheard record. Unlike <em>Ruff Draft</em>, <em>Champion Sound</em> was a widely-released, full-fledged album-- more slept-on than scarce-- and it's aged a bit better than early reviews might've anticipated. More than a few underground rap albums these days have shot for <em>Champion Sound</em>'s stoned-in-the-club vibe and fallen short, while Stones Throw has become indie rap's ""it"" label in recent years with albums much like this: collaborative efforts infused with Madlib's unpretentiously avant-garde spirit, weird enough to stay on the margins of current pop culture but accessible enough to stick on Cartoon Network's [adult swim] (where it seems a bit less bizarre next to willfully batshit stuff like ""Saul of the Mole Men"").</p><p>
    The main thing to keep in mind about <em>Champion Sound</em> is that the two main artists involved adapted to each other's production styles just as much as they contrasted. It's easy to theoretically pit Madlib's muddy, crackly, blown-out organics as a barely-compatible counter to Dilla's pristine digital precision, but there's a stylistic bleedthrough that seeps both ways. Madlib's beats here lack much of the skewed jazz eccentricity that his more familiar Quasimoto and Madvillain productions do. Instead, he fine-tunes his approach so that his more far-out tendencies-- reassembled bop flotsam and beats that have a hard time staying put-- are left to sneak in through the margins. There's odd little touches like the title track's Bollywood vocal (which, post-""Addicted"", didn't skew too far away from the mainstream anyways), the piercing, slightly warped-sounding sustained string note that runs through most of ""The Mission"" and the Asian/Middle-Eastern horn that trills through ""Survival Test"". But like the best Dilla tracks, the bass and drums are at the forefront and do most of the heavy lifting, and a couple of Madlib's beats, like the booming fist-pump rhythm of ""McNasty Filth"" and the insistent stutter-thump of ""Strapped"", feel like low-fi versions of Jay Dee's Slum Village work. 
    </p>
<p>
    Dilla's tracks don't rewrite his own plan as much-- which makes sense, since many of them preceded the idea of the collaboration in the first place-- but they're a bit filthier than usual, his glowing digital bass pushed until it strains; not for nothing is his best beat on here, a heavy slab of big-bottomed g-funk built around a disembodied soul wail and a airlock-tight drum loop, repurposed for a track called ""The Red"". And there's a few points that pick up the slack for the prog-fusion bizarreness Madlib pushed to the background: the melody for ""React"" is based around what might be a guitar riff or a clarinet sped up to a hummingbird tempo, ""Raw Shit"" hammers away at a tinny Farfisa that sounds like it's on its last legs, and ""Strip Club"" features a giggly steel drum that's about as sexy as a coconut bra. </p><p>
    Even if they're not much worth commenting on lyrically-- ""Shoulda never been allowed in the game/ All y'all fake gangstas now"" and ""My thug niggas know what I mean/ A live bitch, that's what I need"" are typical Jay Dee lines, while Madlib's appeal is mostly in his muttering, halting delivery-- the vocals also fit their productions in a complementary way. Jay Dee's elementary rhymes seem as loosely-assembled and grimy as Madlib's beats, while Madlib returns the favor by vocally skulking across Dilla's precision engineering with his conversational counter-rhythms. A few guests keep things switched up: Kweli's turn on ""Raw Shit"" has more value in his endearingly ridiculous half-sung hooks than his unremarkable verses, Frank-n-Dank give ""McNasty Filth"" the confident swagger the tear-the-club-up beat requires, and Percee P throws out so many acrobatic battle-rap turns of phrase on ""The Exclusive"" (""Perce is nice, worth the price, every verse entice/ one of the most praised men to surface twice on this earth since Christ"") that it's easy to forget he's only rapping for about 40 seconds.</p><p>
    Along with the requisite bonus disk of instrumentals and a couple hard-to-find bonus tracks (including the hilarious Madlib-helmed ""Pillz""-- ""Oh shit, I just took an X pill/ now I'm ready to <em>thwoop</em>""), the supplemental material includes a handful of remixes that don't quite fit in with <em>Champion Sound</em>'s original vibe. The beatbox-driven remix of ""The Official"" and the rework of ""Champion Sound"" that sounds like ""Whole Lotta Love"" on a busted harpsichord have their place on the second disc, far out of reach of their superior originals, but might not be enough to justify a purchase for fans who already got the CD first time around. Given its single-disc price, the Deluxe Edition of <em>Champion Sound</em>, like most reissues, has the most value for those who haven't gotten around to hearing the CD until now-- and they're coming to it at just the right time.<br/>

    In the hallowed halls of metaldom, the name Neurosis carries some pretty (no
    pun intended) <em>heavy</em> overtones: they're a staunchly DIY cult band with
    the most devoted following and a long track record of highly innovative
    thinking-man's metal. But anyone even vaguely familiar with their oeuvre would
    wisely <em>not</em> call them a doom band; they're way too varied
    for such a tag. On these San Franciscan metallurgists' ninth album, <em>Given To
    the Rising</em>, Neurosis are simply <em>not</em> fucking around. Within the first
    note you know you're in for a ride: no staple slow-building intros or
    atmospheric effluvia, just a crushing primordial mid-tempo riff that eventually
    falls into one of the album's repeating motifs of bendy, long-hanging funereal
    guitar lines, all braced with plenty of back-to-basics pummeling. The sense of
    purpose is developed further on ""Fear And Sickness"", where disjointed
    yet dissonantly harmonious axe lines dodge and dart in paganistic
    call-and-response around a swing-like snare and kick drum beat. These two dimly
    lit apocalypse-summoning tracks shine light on why <em>Given</em> very well may
    be the best Neurosis album in over a decade-- or at least since 1999's
    signature <em>Times of Grace</em>.</p><p>
    First a re-cap: It's difficult making a new album when you're a band like
    Neurosis. Much like the elders on which they were weaned (Black Sabbath, Pink
    Floyd, Black Flag, Swans), aspects of their sound have spawned entire
    micro-genres. Whether it be their kinetic mega-evil tribal drum-and-guitar
    interplay or their dense layering of creepy samples and textural atmospherics
    or their melodic instrumental passages that birthed the ""metalgaze""
    school-- see Isis and bands such as Cult of Luna and Mouth of the Architect for
    starters-- it's hard to stay fresh when everyone's copping your every move.
    Which is why <em>Given</em> feels so smart and so
    standing-on-the-throats-of-our-imitators-and-not-giving-a-fuck confident.</p><p>
    All the past doomsday bells-and-whistles are still prevalent, all the
    progressive guitar mayhem and Steve Von Till's classic Tom Waits-meets-Michael
    Gira vocals. But unlike their last couple albums-- most notably 2004's
    introspective and mostly-delicate and majestic <em>The Eye of Every Storm</em>--
    the noodley bits are tethered as if in direct response to all the
    quiet-loud-brood-quiet-loud brooding copycats. And songs like the two previously
    mentioned openers, as well as the Jesu-like ""Hidden Faces"" and the
    Mastodon-like chug-fest ""Water is Not Enough"", seem to be cribbing
    notes from the cribbers (as well as the non-copying competition) and then in
    turn streamlining the turns the cribbers previously cribbed. Such as the way
    that soundsculptor/keyboardist Noah Landis masterfully blends the dark ambient
    textures, not just for spooky intros and outros, but for dynamic passages of
    their own. Or the way that the songs-- most averaging around seven and a
    half minutes-- keep morphing from thunderous cacophony to desolate
    soul-searching melodic phrases, but with a mad scientist exactitude regarding
    all of the subtle, beautiful, and terrifying spaces in between. 
    </p>
<p>
    Even dynamically adroit acts like Pelican and, once again, Isis have yet to
    explore these depths of shifting-- and, most importantly, gradual-- peaks and
    valleys. Neurosis have once again conjured those ominous trance-inducing dark spaces, but
    they've placed them in canyons even more broad and deep.

    Rob Lowe of 90 Day Men has an interesting thing going
    with his Lichens project. He's working at the familiar intersection of abstract
    folk and drone, but he uses delays and samples to create heavily layered tracks
    in real time. So while he has on the one hand the Zen-like focus on tone of an
    Oren Ambarchi, wherein he's perfectly willing to let a plucked E-string decay
    without another sound for five or six seconds, he's also got his unusual
    approach to voice to fall back on, where his high-pitched whine can be folded
    in on itself, sucking up all the space as it's stretched out to the horizon.
    His pieces, which tend to be long, can be a bit like spinning plates, as he
    sets various sounds in motion and keeps them going while figuring out where the
    music is going next.</p><p>
    The DVD included with <em>Omns</em>, his second album for Kranky, shows how
    Lowe makes it happen in concert. Footage recorded live at Chicago's Empty
    Bottle is intercut with scenes shot in a forest; appropriate enough
    considering that Lichens sometimes sounds like a field recording of some
    Earth-worshiping pagan cult ritual, or perhaps a séance. It seems wrong to
    listen without a cone of incense smoldering away somewhere nearby, and it's not
    hard to understand why some might be put off by the overt mysticism. At one
    point during the film, the camera zooms in and catches Lowe closing his eyes in
    concentration as he wails toward the sky, bringing to mind for a moment the
    image of a young urban professional on a weekend <em>Iron John </em>retreat.</p><p>
    But it's easy to forget about that stuff when just listening to <em>Omns</em>,
    which is richer than the 2005 Lichens album <em>The Psychic Nature of Being</em>.
    Lowe does a nice job of varying his palette, mixing up the tone and timbre of
    the tracks to stay down in a certain groove while avoiding monotony. Both
    ""Vevor Of Agassou"" and ""Faeries"", for example, are built
    primarily around vocal drones. The former has Lowe massing his tones together
    to sound like insects trying to find each other in a pitch-black cave; the
    latter begins with a more a more ethereal/4AD approach and then brings in bits
    of piano for an acoustic contrast. But while these two are of a piece,
    ""Bune"" comes from somewhere else-- namely, the rock tradition-- as
    Lowe knuckles down for a slow burn, distorted, and heavily psychedelic guitar
    solo. 
    </p>
    The
    18-minute track with the Wheel of Fortune title ""M St R Ng W Tchcr Ft L V
    Ng N Sp R T"" is the record's obvious centerpiece, and seems to fold in
    bits of everything going on elsewhere. Beginning with some acoustic
    fingerpicking, it drifts into a synth drone, at then goes into an extended
    section of bird song. Eventually Lowe begins to sing along with the
    ornithological crew, adding his plaintive and vaguely liturgical wail to the
    chirps. If you're instantly turned off by anything smacking of new age this is
    obviously not for you, but Lowe conjures a rather uncertain mood with the
    track, generally favoring a slowly building tension despite the presence of the
    birds. Closing out the album is the two-minute electric guitar instrumental
    ""Sighns"", the aural equivalent of sunlight refracted through a bead
    of water, which turns out to be the right sort of coda after the record's
    subtle heaviness.</div>"|10339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10339-omns/|7.4|Mark Richardson

    As with so many acts on the Rune Grammofon roster, the duo of Eivind Opsvik and Aaron Jennings construct their work directly on the faultlines that separate each musical genre from the next. Their instrumental tides incorporate stray elements of folk, jazz, and country with an impressively gentle touch, as the two musicians invisibly blend acoustic instruments with subtle software effects. With the aid of such evocative titles as ""The Last Country Village"" and ""Lorinda Sea"", the liminal music on <em>Commuter Anthems</em> has melancholic, faintly nostalgic tug, as though absorbed in the quiet conflict between the present and the idealized thoughts of a mythic, pastoral history.</p><p>
    Opsvik &amp; Jennings-- New Yorkers by way, respectively, of Oslo and Oklahoma-- might sound like a name better suited to a law firm or a chiropractic clinic, and at points on <em>Commuter Anthems</em> they can perhaps seem rather too business-like in their approach. The two musicians have each been active in a variety of projects, largely grounded in jazz and experimental pop. On <em>Commuter Anthems</em>, their second album overall and their first on Rune Grammofon, the duo make a host of unlikely instrumental choices, joining melodic fragments of banjo and lap steel to jazz string bass and tranquil laptop figures. To their credit, Opsvik &amp; Jennings take care throughout to de-emphasize their composing and recording process, and they partner their individual styles so seamlessly that the album can often seem as a dream-wave transmitted directly from a single conjoined imagination.</p><p>
    True to its title, <em>Commuter Anthems</em> is filled with exactly the sort of distant, half-remembered melodic fragments that one might envision while nodding off on the evening train. ""The Last Country Village"" builds up from a base of acoustic guitar and tuned percussion to warm swells of lap steel, patiently chasing a sleepy melody that remains just tantalizingly out of reach. Wordless bah-dah-dah vocals decorate ""Port Authority"" and the title track, further lending to their ethereal daydream character. On such jazzier tracks as the lengthy ""I'll Scrounge Along"", the duo can call to mind the languid rumble of early Tortoise, while Jennings' contributions on guitar and a variety of string instruments echo some of Bill Frisell's cross-genre explorations. 
    </p>
<p>
    As the album progresses, Opsvik &amp; Jennings allow themselves extra enough driving time for a couple fruitful side trips. On the hypnotic ""Ways"" the duo take a break from forward momentum altogether, settling into one of the album's richest melodies with banjo and theremin for an idyllic respite amidst the tempered commotion. Here, as on the lyric ""Lorinda Sea"", the additions of banjo, pedal steel, and/or trumpet cast a wistful, rural glow that sways and hovers like pollen on a lingering summer breeze, only to soon be scattered by a shuffled rhythm or electronic edit. Throughout the length of <em>Commuter Anthems</em>, one can hardly help but wish that Opsvik &amp; Jennings had chosen to push these songs a little further, and take their melodies grander, or allowed their stylistic leaps to retain more of their natural dissonance. Lovely though the album is, the duo appear content to treat their <em>Anthems</em> with an air of light detachment, almost as if too much extra attention or creative interference might cause these fragile creations to vanish off into the twilight as suddenly as they've arrived.

    Does size matter? Now three albums in, the Polyphonic Spree
    would appear to be the indie rock band uniquely positioned to answer that question. The Dallas
    symphonic-pop chorale weren't the first under-the-radar group to mimic the
    overflowing orchestration of sunshine-pop acts the Fifth Dimension and the
    Partridge Family; Danielson did this in the 90s. But the Spree's 2002 debut coincided
    with a period of new respect for over-sized lineups, from Broken Social Scene and the Arcade Fire to Architecture in Helsinki
    and I'm From Barcelona, with even Belle &amp; Sebastian going <em>Godspell</em> for a minute there. Surely
    indie rock nerds couldn't just be overcompensating. <br/></p><p>
    In the battle of ""size of the boat"" vs. ""motion of the ocean,"" new Spree
    album <em>The Fragile Army</em> proves,
    perhaps appropriately...indecisive. Pre-release buzz centered as much on
    the band's shift from robes to black combat garb as on its new
    songs, but ain't nothing wrong with a good gimmick. <em>The Fragile Army </em>channels the group's positive
    collective energy into a more focused political solidarity, plus a few of Tim DeLaughter's best songs since his Tripping
    Daisy days. Still, the Spree's vision remains too vague,
    their revolutionary pop ambition too dependent on fuddy-duddy classical pomp, for <em>The Fragile Army</em> to rank as an unqualified
    success. <br/></p><p>
    Relatively speaking, the Spree
    have downsized. For <em>The Fragile Army</em>,
    DeLaughter and wife/co-leader Julie Doyle pared their joyous horde down to 24
    members from 28 and built their songs around the rock-oriented core of the group's
    vaunted live performances. In fact, the trilling flutes, imperial horns, and bombastic
    strings-- even the fleet-fingered guitar fills-- of energetic first single
    ""Section 22 [Running Away]"" sound almost incidental to this ordinary power-pop
    love song. If the Spree's cover of Tripping Daisy's ""Sonic Bloom"" on
    last year's <em>Wait </em>EP showed how
    DeLaughter's themes have stayed consistent, it also
    illustrated that a choir and orchestra are often embellishments rather
    than essential elements of his songwriting. Ho-hum rocker ""Section 23 [Get Up
    and Go]"" reiterates the point. 
    </p>
<p>
    Not so the title track, which needs all the bigness the Spree can muster (and the ""Karma
    Police"" piano of David Bowie cohort Mike Garson) to bring its anti-Bush ""Bohemian
    Rhapsody"" onto Broadway: ""It's time for you to lose your
    excitement,"" the choir repeats, whatever that means. But DeLaughter's biggest
    breakthrough on <em>The Fragile Army</em>
    comes with ""Section 29 [Light to Follow]"", which establishes the
    record's overarching subject-- ""love in a mixed-up time""-- and explores new
    sounds for the group, from electronic beats to an Air-like bass groove,
    achieving spacey ambiance instead of anodyne catharsis. Rich with guitar
    harmonics, ""Section 31 [Overblow Your Nest]"" is another of
    DeLaughter's more emotionally sophisticated songs and also an existential assertion of self: ""I want this world to know that I'm alive,"" goes a surging, ELO-like chorus lyric. 
    </p>
<p>
    That individualistic mantra is at odds
    with Spree's egoless concept-- many voices
    joining as one to accomplish any goal, overturn any war-monger. ""Together
    we're all right,"" DeLaughter intones on uncharacteristically bittersweet ""Section
    25 [Younger Yesterday]"", still sounding like Wayne Coyne. ""When we're
    both together, I know that we'll be just fine,"" the Spree chieftain adds on a lush slower
    song, ""Section 26 [We Crawl]"". Brief instrumental opener  ""Section 21 [Together We're Heavy]"" echoes the title track to the group's
    2004 album of the same name (minus the section number). In interviews, DeLaughter has been talking up utopia. ""It's a goal I think we all have deep down,"" he tells <em>Paste</em>. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Pop's most famous utopian, John Lennon, picked up Sir Thomas
    More where Karl Marx left him: No possessions, and no religion, too. Echoing Lennon and Ono's refrain ""war is over (if you want it)"" on finale ""Section 32 [The Championship]"", DeLaughter sings, ""Someday
    the world will be one if we try."" Fine, but one <em>what</em>? The Spree frontman's
    vision shares the unitarian communalism of other ""perfect
    societies""; on the other hand, President Bush's post-9/11 stranglehold over
    national policy relied on unity, too. We don't want campaign platforms from our rock stars, but it'd be nice if their idealism extended beyond well-meaning peer pressure. 
    </p>
<p>
    For Plato, a ""just society"" doesn't even have music. For Todd Rundgren, Utopia were a
    three-keyboard 70s prog-rock band. As for the Spree, it's hard to believe any utopia would sound like symphonic-veneered rock music-- a style some classic-rock mainstays adopted back when their forward-looking peers were developing new genres. <em>The Fragile Army</em> is an all-out
    orchestral and choral assault for optimism in a turbulent era, but only
    infrequently are the Spree's songs as
    memorable as their numbers (and changing wardrobe).

Torch-bearers Tortoise settled into a predictable, off-kilter groove with 2004's <em>It's All Around You</em> and riff-monsters like Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky sound less triumphant and more manipulative with every touchdown-worthy crescendo. In the current climate, a genuine post-rock stunner like Battles' <em>Mirrored</em> is considered more of a one-off shock than a revitalizing statement. So it's an odd time for cult post-rock heroes Kieran Hebden, Adem Ilhan, and Sam Jeffers to resurface as Fridge six years after their elegant high-water mark, <em>Happiness</em>. The return is especially strange considering the respectable indie success Hebden and Ilhan have achieved as Four Tet and Adem since 2001. Possibly by design, they won't have to worry about <em>The Sun</em> taking off and putting their solo careers on hold. Instead of combining to push their moody acoustic-electronic instrumentals into the future (or at least the present), Fridge come across as a nostalgia act on <em>The Sun</em>-- a hodge-podge of rough sketches dressed-up as a comeback.</p><p>
    While their output ranges from wiry guitar excursions to hypnotic krautrock to Eno wallpaper, Fridge excel most at subtle, scuttling foreplay-- their best work sounds like the first minute of every Sigur Rós song aired-out and deconstructed. As such, <em>Happiness</em> stands as their most complete record, teeming with  the meticulously precious production Hebden would later expand upon with 2003's Four Tet effort <em>Rounds</em>. <em>Happiness</em> is a benchmark of homed-in humility, revealing its gorgeousness in shimmers of warm acoustics and careful, cut-up percussion. By contrast, <em>The Sun</em> starts with a track more akin to Hebden's recent scattershot work with drummer Steve Reid than anything in Fridge's catalog. It's a jarring and showy Sun Ra-style introduction adorned with plenty of cymbals and feedback-- a ""look what we learned!"" moment that plays against the group's taut, minimalist strengths and a telling precursor of what's to come.</p><p>
    Hebden's-- and, to a lesser extent, Ilhan's-- impressive solo material also works against them in this context because we know the heights they're capable of on their own; in that light, most of <em>The Sun</em> sounds like a batch of slap-dash demos for other projects. The pretty-enough ""Our Place in This"" and Broken Social Scene-esque ""Lost Time"" lull like in-progress Adem songs, while the rumbling ""Oram"" and the stumbling ""Insects"" could very well be sub par left-overs from Hebden's last Four Tet album, <em>Everything Ecstatic</em>. The lilting ""Comets"", with its simplistic piano chords, loping upright bass, and looping drum machine, has the trio using repetition and tunefulness to its advantage-- too bad it's the exception rather than the rule here.
    </p><p>
    Free-spirited and Bonnaroo-friendly, <em>The Sun</em> is more of an alternate Fridge history (heavy on the rock-leaning jams of their early albums and EPs) than a progressive follow-up to <em>Happiness</em>. While the band has certainly grown musically, it also seems less patient and focused; much of the record feels like a hastily recorded jam session with a few superfluous electro-bobbles floating above the fray. More than anything, it's the sound of three long-time friends trying to stuff a couple new tricks into old memories and coming up with a discombobulated coda.

    Cuba was a late 20<sup>th</sup> Century anomaly: a repressive communist
    government that fostered a vibrant, influential, and essential musical output.
    Cuban sounds resonate and persist in music throughout Latin America, Africa
    (where some of the most popular styles have roots in the Cuban rhumba), Europe,
    and even, yes, the United States. Americans tend to think of Cuba as more
    isolated than it really is. You may not be able to fly there from our airports,
    but if you simply drive over the border to Toronto or Mexico City, no one will
    stop you.</p><p>
    In the 1960s and 70s, Cuban music played just as big a role in the
    development of popular music styles in Central and West Africa as anything
    coming out of the U.S. or Europe. Still, Cuba's lone record label, Egrem, is
    the property of a government with no real conception of how to run a business
    (check their housing policies for proof), and that means recorded music is
    erratically available outside the island, when it's available at all. It's been
    up to labels like Nonesuch, Escondida, and Honest Jon's to go in search of it
    and make it available.</p><p>
    Which is to say there's a lot we don't know about Cuban music and plenty of
    exploring to do. The guys at Waxing Deep, producers of a radio show and popular
    podcast, have taken note of the overwhelming response to the funky Cuban tracks
    they play in their sets and decided it was time to make some of this elusive
    music available to everyone, complete with well-researched liners and a wealth
    of background information. The music they've gathered comes mostly from the
    70s, with a bit of bleed into the 80s, and based on what I hear, I couldn't be
    happier about the implications of that ""Volume 1"" at the end of the
    title. 
    </p>
<p>
    One important thing to note before we get to the details is that Castro's government,
    for all its innumerable flaws and broad terribleness, has generally been good
    to its musicians. They were granted artistic freedom so long as the music
    didn't get out of line politically, professional musicians were on the government
    payroll and so had no worries about making ends meet, and subsidies opened
    top-tier music academies to anyone who was good enough and had the desire,
    eradicating established class barriers. Not a perfect system, but one that
    allowed for amazing variety and prolific creation. 
    </p>
<p>
    If you're into Cuban music beyond Buena Vista, Arturo Sandoval and Celia
    Cruz, you'll likely recognize some of these names-- Jaun Formell y Los Van Van,
    Orquesta Riverside, Juan Pablo Torres, Irakere-- but you'll likely scratch your
    head at some others. This compilation digs deep to provide a nice mix of
    straight-ahead funk and psychedelic experimentation, with frequent hints of
    more traditional sound. They've also mostly chosen individual tracks that
    haven't made it outside of Cuba before. 
    </p>
<p>
    Juan Pablo Torres and his band Algo Nuevo (""Something New"") check
    in with three tracks, including disc opener ""Son a Propulsion"", which
    is well described in its title. It brings the traditional song form of the son,
    which predominated in the 30s, to bear on stabbing horns, wicked fuzz guitar,
    dubby effects and funk drums. It's just an appetizer for the track that follows
    it, though. Irakere's ""Bacalao con Pan"" is an astounding slab of
    grinding, psychedelic funk that tosses freak-out guitars with bright horns and
    even a bit of salsa piano for a mix that justifiably became a massive Cuban
    hit. 
    </p>
<p>
    There's an abundance of weird sounds on the compilation. Síntesis' ""Con
    la Luz de la Mañana"" is crazy, synth-heavy fusion with stacked vocals and
    a definite European prog influence. Los Van Van's ""Y No le Conviene""
    is colored by a strangely arranged string section, and Grupo de Experimentación
    Sonora del ICAIC's ""Sondeando"" is government-sponsored free funk. The
    electric bass tone (chorus with light distortion) on Jorge Reyes' ""Pocito
    11"" is unbelievably grotesque, and the bass is the lead instrument for
    much of the song-clearly some very left-field American and European fusion
    records were circulating in Cuba when this was made. 
    </p>
<p>
    Even an old institutional orchestra, Orquesta Riverside, which thrived on
    Cuban radio since well before revolution was even a glimmer in Castro's eye,
    gets in on the action with a super-funky big band track that features great
    call-and-response vocals. I'm used to the group as a purveyor of something much
    more traditional (their early 78s are treasures), but damn it's fun to hear
    them getting up expressly to get down here. 
    </p>
<p>
    The compilation ends with its biggest shock: the psychedelic, Eastern-tinged
    trip that is Mirtha Y Raul's ""Casina Y Epidecus"", which comes
    complete with an oud part and a spoken word passage that Timothy Leary would've
    died for. It's a surprising end to a necessary and vital compilation that
    exposes a world that never deserved to be hidden. These artists took promise of
    artistic freedom they were given to heart and created some wonderful and
    innovative syntheses. This is what every revolution should sound like.

    When famed post-punks the Pop Group disbanded at the start of the 1980s,
    barely-legal frontman Mark Stewart joined forces with Adrian Sherwood, a white
    Briton dedicated to going where no dub reggae producer had gone before. The
    first album of this union, <em>Learning to Cope With Cowardice</em>, is still a
    proudly, profoundly disorienting act of oblique cold war criticism. Oh, and
    it's as funky as the early hip-hop Stewart was clearly digging as an import.
    ""The Wrong Name and the Wrong Number"", a bonus track included on this
    reissue, is listed as a ""DJ battle"" and sounds like it's cutting up
    Cheryl Lynn's ""Got to Be Real"" with the Funky 4+1's
    ""It's the Joint"". On the other hand, no Bronx block party was rocked
    by this much distortion, even through the crappiest speakers. And that's not to
    mention the samples of froggy doomsayer William S. Burroughs and a hysterical
    Stewart shouting ""This is a restricted area!"" when you least expect
    it.</p><p>
    As Stewart groans like a boy in the corner of his own songs-- much like his
    future friend Tricky later would-- and the drums pop like they're being dropped
    into a pot of hot oil, the zombie female backing vocals and vaguely Ethiopian
    saxophones on tracks like ""Liberty City"" and ""The Paranoia of
    Power"" twist roots reggae's trappings of earth-mother security into a
    hall-of-mirrors horror. And in Sherwood's hands, reggae steppers rhythms and
    American funk grooves-- played by members of bands like African Headcharge and
    Creation Rebel, who orbited Sherwood's On U Sound label-- lurched drunkenly
    through the hazy vale of dub's purposeful obfuscation. Throughout <em>Cowardice</em>
    Sherwood EQ's Stewart's voice into a thousand shades of fucked up, raises and
    lowers the volume level on the mix with a near-sadistic inexplicableness,
    phases everything until it curls like palm fronds, or blasts it mercilessly
    with grating noise.</p><p>
    But even obscured, the political ambitions of Stewart's lyrics are implicit
    in the album's title. ""Let's storm the citadels!"" he shrieks from
    nowhere on ""The Paranoia of Power"", except his mocking delivery (and
    the instability of Sherwood's mix) feels like a satire of such easily-stenciled
    politico slogans. On <em>Cowardice</em>, Stewart rejected both the
    easy-to-swallow, Day-Glo pop tranquilizers of the 80s and the bluntness that
    came to characterize the Pop Group's final records for wracked, ambiguous
    protest music. So who better to turn to for lyrics than a possible madman and
    authority-critiquing refusenik that was marginalized in his own time, only to
    later be viewed as a seer? On <em>Cowardice</em>'s version of William Blake's own
    wracked, proto-""the-personal-is-political"" English portrait
    ""Jerusalem"", the poet's mania becomes manifest as Sherwood mixes the
    drums as if your ear is laying on the snare and places Stewart's voice as if
    he's on the other side of a warehouse shouting through a megaphone that keeps
    shorting out, a taped orchestral version of the hymn wobbling triumphantly
    behind him.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Jerusalem"" has come to be seen by many as Stewart's defining
    moment, like hearing one English visionary stretched through another, and
    it is undoubtedly the most psychedelic (and weirdly beautiful) moment to come out of
    post-punk. Unfortunately, the bulk of <em>Learning to Cope With Cowardice</em>
    lacks the power ""Jerusalem"" comes by through its unearthly mix of the
    pastoral and the terrible. And as with the crumbling basslines and unspooling
    tape effects of the Pop Group's 1978 half-masterpiece <em>Y</em>, <em>Cowardice</em>'s
    sonic instability can be infuriating if you hate it when a good groove gets
    poked full of holes. When it comes together, however, the disorientation feels
    right on time for reissue in an era of renewed nuclear hostilities, as
    protesters clash at the G8 summit and we continue to drug ourselves on reality
    TV shenanigans and celebrity weddings.

    Robert Harrison formed Future Clouds &amp; Radar after the break-up of his
    former group, garage-pop hopefuls Cotton Mather, but it was a serious spinal
    injury that he says led to his new band's self-titled, self-released debut. He
    wrote from his bed for two years, then recorded and played with a revolving
    roster of Austin musicians. At 27 tracks covering a range of styles and sounds,
    <em>Future Clouds &amp; Radar</em> is predictably ambitious, overlong, and
    aggressive in its eagerness to impress. Like almost all double albums, it
    provokes the phrase ""needs an editor."" But this exaggerated scope
    makes a certain kind of sense: in a large scene clogged with new bands and big
    statements, selling yourself as a pop genius through this sort of monument to
    indie hubris at least gets you noticed.</p><p>
    And it just might work: already this debut has earned praise for its scope
    and has garnered comparisons to <em>The White Album</em>, among other doubles.
    Certainly the Beatles are Robert Harrison's primary frame of reference-- along
    with artists like George Harrison, John Lennon, and Wings-- but <em>Future
    Clouds &amp; Radar </em>is not the sort of interesting mess that <em>The White
    Album</em> was. Of course, there is so much material here that it inevitably
    hits all the marks: from wholly unlistenable (""Doctor No"") and
    bafflingly bad (""Cowboy Weather"") to decent enough (""Let Me Get
    Your Coat"") and actually really good (""Build Havana""). But even
    at its best, there's no connective tissue between these songs, no overarching
    theme or consistency of quality to justify its immodest length.</p><p>
    Harrison's everything-and-the-kitchen-sink production doesn't help, either.
    These songs are busy with sound, as if intended for a hyperactive child: in
    addition to the standard pop instruments, there are crickets, chimes, sitars,
    drones, static, ghostly background voices, errant beats, and floating samples
    of significant dialogue, as well as unidentifiable clicks, chirps, whirs,
    loops, bings, blips, pings, pongs, bells, and whistles. Such excess, however,
    does not denote originality or excitement in this case: despite Harrison's best
    efforts to cram these songs to bursting with so many Technicolor sounds, these
    two discs are relentlessly beige-- pop without any power, psychedelia rendered
    as easy listening. On songs like ""Malice of Stars"" and the cover of
    Bob Marley's ""Wake Up and Live"", the supersaturated production drowns
    the melodies in noise, distracting you from the songs' core. Elsewhere, it tugs
    the songs earthward, making them sound leaden and often annoyingly choppy. 
    </p>
<p>
    Worst of all, a certain smugness rules these proceedings-- the same kind
    that makes us scoff at baby-boomer blues rockers like Eric Clapton and makes
    hardcore Beatles fans largely unbearable. <em>Future Clouds &amp; Radar</em>
    gives the sense that Robert Harrison and his band make music with the
    conviction that their influences-- their idols-- are critically unassailable
    and that perhaps they are similarly unassailable by association. But no artist
    is merely the sum of his or her influences. It's not who you listen to that
    matters, but what you do with what you've heard. Future Clouds &amp; Radar do
    way too much, but not nearly enough.

    For all intents and purposes, the White Stripes appeared to be defunct in 2006, put on hiatus while Jack White gallivanted the globe with Midwestern pals the Raconteurs. The previous year's <em>Get Behind Me Satan</em>, commercial success that it was, sounded in retrospect like a man frustrated with his duo's limited options, fiddling with more keyboards and pedals than previous Stripes LPs. Coupled with White's perceptible glee at the Raconteurs' expanded sonic palette and shared frontman duties-- not to mention the more diverse wardrobe options-- some thought it unlikely he'd don the red and white again any time soon.</p><p>
<em>
    Icky Thump</em>, then, is a bit of a resurrection: Reuniting with Meg gives Jack the opportunity to slip back into sister-lover character, get his weird clothes out of the attic, and return to basement blues. After the straightforward radio-rock trappings of the Raconteurs,  <em>Icky Thump</em> packs an unexpected freshness, even given its back-to-basics premise; had it come immediately after <em>Satan</em>, it could have seemed like a cynical, regressive gift to the core fanbase, but following <em>Broken Boy Soldiers</em>, it recaptures a sense of goofy fun and a caustic edge that the duo haven't possessed since <em>White Blood Cells</em> launched them to the A-list.</p><p>
    Recorded over what qualifies as a marathon session for the Stripes (a whole <em>three weeks</em>), <em>Icky Thump</em> re-assembles most of the scrap-heap elements that characterized the White Stripes' pre-fame trilogy: grimy garage-blues, a left-field cover, bizarre spoken-word bits, and shameless Zeppelin and Dylan cues. The most obvious breaking development is White's instrument sound-- its tones are so aggressively tweaked that it's hard to tell whether he's playing a guitar that sounds like a keyboard or a keyboard being played like a guitar (prediction for the next White Stripes album gimmick: keytar). 
    </p>
<p>
    The leadoff title track declares this territory nicely, alternating an overdriven, tortured organ with savage guitar jabs, and already proving a better integration of keys and frets than <em>Satan</em>'s marimba experiments. ""I'm Slowly Turning Into You"" blends Wurlitzer verses with fuzz-guitar choruses almost seamlessly; ""St. Andrew (The Battle Is in the Air)"" finds White facing off against bagpipes (yes, bagpipes) with chainsaw seizures; and on ""Conquest"", he trades shrieking Casio tones with a trumpeter.
    </p>
<p>
    Yet, <em>Icky Thump</em> also treats us to a band that once again seems comfortable with its broken-in sounds, from the reverb-thud hammer of ""Little Cream Soda"" and the British Invasion 12-bar of ""300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues"" to the back-porch ditty of ""Effect &amp; Cause"". Perennially dismissed, Meg White once again puts the lie to the theory that John Bonham like totally <em>made</em> Led Zeppelin bro, squeezing the most from her limited repertoire and unsteady tempo when locking in with Jack on classic Stripes-stomp breakdowns like the one in ""You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told)"", where raw talent takes a backseat to chemistry.  The duo's effortless dynamic on ""Bone Broke"" dismisses the garage-rock trend starting to tiresomely re-bubble yet again amongst the indie dregs, showing that world tours haven't taken them too far away from sweaty suburban Detroit house parties.
    </p>
<p>
    But unlike most other 10th-time-around blues-rock revivalists, the Stripes don't settle for endlessly rewriting ""96 Tears"", as the record's two weirdest (and maybe best) cuts prove. ""Conquest"", with its theatrical vocal and faux-mariachi fanfares, teases a promising revved-up early Scott Walker direction until you realize that it's a meticulous recreation of the Patti Page original. ""Rag &amp; Bone"" with its spoken-word verses, is practically a thesis statement for a band that loves to write songs about itself, casting Jack and Meg as junk collectors with a way-creepy relationship, prone to amphetamine rambles and big, chunky rock choruses.
    </p>
<p>
    If there's a complaint to be registered about <em>Icky Thump</em>, it's that certain aspects of the Stripes' early character appear to have been annexed off: The sweet pop of ""You're Pretty Good Lookin' (For a Girl)"" would probably be Raconteurs property nowadays, and White's country dalliances (i.e. ""Hotel Yorba"") are totally absent. Revisiting old territory also carries with it the hazard of backward comparison, and the highest highs of <em>Icky</em> can't quite reach the altitude of the band's breakthrough singles, but some of that inadequacy is tempered by the group's more robust sound-- <em>De Stijl</em> now feels anorexic in a side-by-side taste-test. Whether it was remembering their own advice from ""Little Room"" or the freedom to write in another mode with the Raconteurs, White's strategy worked its rejuvenating magic, allowing the Stripes to roll back the stone on <em>Icky Thump</em>.

    basslines, dolorous chimes, reticular house percussion, and unidentifiable found
    sounds (TV static? Trickling water? Rocks banging together?), seems to dwell at
    the precise point where nature and industry become indistinguishable. It's a
    vantage point from which plants and machines become just more shapes to
    populate the surface of the earth, and from which humans are curiously absent.
    But Weber is not blind to the differences between the two, and <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">This Bliss </span>moves gracefully between
    visions of the natural world and its manmade counterfeits. Given the sweeping
    romanticism of his depiction of the former, it's not surprising that technology
    adopts a slightly sinister role in his work: If the music quite frequently
    drifts towards ""proper” dance music (often resembling the cavernous grooves of
    LFO's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Frequencies</span>, only with none of its playfulness), this is portrayed throughout as a
    sign that things are <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">very wrong.</span></p><p>
    As
    with Ellen Allien and Apparat's <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Orchestra of Bubbles </span>album from last year, Weber is
    less interesting in a sonic fusion of the human and the mechanic than he is in
    playing the differences off one another, and <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">This Bliss</span> mostly<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> </span>sidesteps the naturalist
    preoccupations of much recent German techno. For all its intricacy, its
    lushness, this music is clearly the product of a strictly mathematical technology,
    its clicks and whirs and tinkling arpeggios evoking images of an abandoned
    factory in which the machines quietly run themselves. The mechanical
    abstraction of ""Moonstruck"" counterposes an ominous, almost gritty bassline and
    depressive, atomized synth patterns that occasionally resolve into the vigilant
    bleep of a life-support machine (Note to producers: This trick always works),
    while for long sections the moody ""Urlichten"" <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""></span>sounds like it's being sucked
    through an industrial fan.
    </p><p>
    Even when Weber is
    indulging in crystalline and romantic visions of nature, the music remains a
    stage without actors: The sighing strings, furtive rustles and mournful horns
    of ""Saturn Strobe"" could be the sound of an abandoned forest
    patiently crafting its own elegy, utterly detached and yet quietly sorrowful as
    it awaits its own demise. Only in the anthemic final act of ""Walden 2"" is any
    light let in, with a succession of spectacular synth arpeggios that sound
    almost hopeful; but the moment passes quickly into a sense of remorse, as if
    hope is only defined by its own precariousness-- hope itself becomes too much
    to hope for in a narrative defined by decay. This overwhelming sense of loss,
    of something slipping away, becomes almost claustrophobic as the album
    continues, and exacerbates its context-dependence: In the wrong setting its
    pathos can become intolerable and its fragility ignorable. Choose your moments,
    however, and the quiet rebuke of this music makes for a magically humbling
    experience.

    Blaxploitation films of the 1970s have always been a wellspring of ideas for
    hip-hop. <em>Superfly</em>, <em>The Mack</em>, and <em>Dolomite</em> served helped
    cement concepts of black masculinity and gave rise to the pimp/pusher
    caricature still glorified by many modern day rappers. You get mad at Snoop for
    claiming that he's ""never met a bitch that a pimp can't slap""? Spread
    a little of that moral hysteria to the O.G.s like Rudy Ray Moore (of course,
    you might also want to save a little spite for the government goons who oversaw
    the assassination, imprisonment, and marginalization of black leaders following
    the riotous 60s).</p><p>
    And while it's no surprise that another rap group is adopting the
    flared-out, pimpadelic funk template of these films, it does come as a bit of a
    shock that this time Portland's Lifesavas are the culprits. After all, Lifesavas
    are the oh-so-conscious, Blackalicious-cosigned group of rap bohos who spent
    their 2003 debut, <em>Spirit in Stone</em>, ruminating on political apocalypse,
    spiritual desolation, and postmodern identity politics. But here the Portland
    trio jumps into the conceit feet first. They've adopted the personas of Bumpy
    Johnson (Vursatyl), Sleepy Floyd (Jumbo) and Jimmy Slimwater (DJ Rev Shines),
    and they traverse the mean streets of Razorblade City, ostensibly a stand-in
    for Portland but really more of an allegorical dump for all modern day social
    ills.</p><p>
    If you can get past the geeky premise-- and, admittedly, it's a big hurdle--
    the album is wonderful. From the outset, producer Jumbo absolutely nails the
    sound of blaxploitation films. His work lurches off the disk, strutting out the
    shuffling noir of ""A Serpents Love"" and the bouncy funk of
    ""Shine Language"" before dipping into the bleary, cerebral valleys of
    ""Take Me Away"" and ""No Surprise + Scene 1 + Fly Paper""
    (produced by Seattle beatsmith Vitamin D). Certainly Bobbie Womack's seminal <em>Across
    110th Street</em> soundtrack is a touchstone for the sound, but you can also
    hear echoes of Edwin Starr's <em>Hell Up in Harlem</em> and Willie Hutch's <em>Foxy
    Brown</em> score in the mix. And, as with everything that comes out Quannum
    camp, the sound is both satisfying dense and impeccably polished.
    </p>
<p>
    The album also manages to seamlessly employ live instrumentation-- it never
    feels as though the musicians are being incorporated for the sake of a gimmick.
    Of course, it also doesn't hurt that the album serves as a virtual reunion
    platform for the old Black Rock Coalition, with Vernon Reid, members of
    Fishbone, and George Clinton all dropping in.
    </p>
<p>
    On the mic, lead Lifesavas MC Vursatyl delivers a virtuosic performance. He
    overcomes a somewhat generic voice by stringing together rapid-fire metaphors
    and finely detailed ghetto surveys. For most the album, he veers away from
    anti-rap moralizing, instead opting for a broader social criticism. ""Shine
    Language"", in particular, is strong. The MCs assemble a visual pastiche of
    housing projects, murderers, maximum-security prisons, unemployment offices,
    and homeless shelters. But though imagery is bleak, the message is
    transcendent, and the song ultimately offers a testament to the power of
    self-determination. Vurs ends by asking the audience to feel the tension of the
    disenfranchised people when it's our time. This is not an easily digestible
    album-- it takes a few close listens-- but it's ultimately rewarding.

    Late last year Ángel Sánchez Borges released a mini-album of ethereal
    drone-pop under the name Seekers Who Are Lovers. Seekers could be considered a
    side project for Borges if he didn't have so many things going on at once; he's
    also an experimental video artist of some renown, and now returns as Antiguo
    Autómata Mexicano, the name he uses for instrumental journeys into beat-driven
    minimalism. In 2005 he released his debut AAM record <em>Microhate </em>on the
    German label Backgroung; follow-up <em>Kraut Slut</em> is his first release for
    the Tijuana-based label Static Discos.</p><p>
    Given the titles of the album and the first track here, ""Rother,
    Dinger, You, and Me"", you might guess you're in for a concept record. And
    ""Rother"" certainly delivers on that score, channeling the spirit and
    the sound of classic Neu! with almost frightening accuracy, but doing so in an
    even more compact and completely digital package. It's basically a cover tune,
    but covering a sound as opposed to a song; Borges programs a simple series of
    pulses to mimic the interplay between Dinger's stark and insistent drum pulse
    frames Rother's buzzing, carefully picked guitar. Both the idea and the
    execution are fantastic.</p><p>
    But <em>Kraut Slut </em>doesn't stay long on the motorik road.
    ""Mitte"" sticks with sharp, crackly beats but drapes over them a soft
    curtain of static and lush chords suggesting a much more amorphous and dreamy
    headspace. It has the pulse of techno, but in terms of mood ""Mitte"" is
    closer to the shadowy and sensual world of his Seekers work. Same goes for
    ""Extirpe"" which is mostly slow-drift synthetic drone, with just a few
    percussive beeps and rips lurking in the shadows, while ""Harm and Jazz"" kicks
    up so much digital dust it the foreground, a constantly shifting collage of
    machine noise and buzzes, you can barely make out the steady bass and drums
    moving somewhere behind. ""Malandro de Culto"" and ""Ill Stijl""
    are Borges' excursion into more dancefloor-oriented techno, and the latter
    especially, with its precise but busy array of bleeps, is a particularly
    focused beam of forward-moving energy.  
    </p>
<p>
    So then, album title and opening track aside, what exactly binds these
    disparate elements into a single project? Borges seems most drawn to
    micro-leaning computer music as a way to conjure atmosphere; there's a lot of
    suggestion in Borges' music, hints at various possibilities, and you never get
    the sense that the technology-- always at the forefront considering the
    persistent use of glitches and noise-- is the music's subject. On its own, <em>Kraut
    Slut </em>is an evocative sampling of the potential of computer-based minimalism
    with a handful of fantastic tracks; considered along with Borges' other recent
    work, the record makes him seem an even more compelling artist worth following
    closely.

Actually, it might be longer, since I'm not sure if ""vinyl crackle plus bass pulse"" really counts as a beat. Thomas' extended intros are nearly all atmosphere and ambient drift because he's serving notice on anyone who comes to his mixes looking for a little Saturday night fever. Thomas is keenly aware that a mix CD should operate on its own-- in this case more intimate-- terms. <em>Please, Please, Please</em> is an object made by one friend for another, rather than by a DJ looking to make 1,000 friends on the dancefloor.</p><p>
    Thomas gets so intimate, in fact, that he almost climbs into your inner ear. The opening of <em>PPP</em> takes the deliquescing church bells of Pantha Du Prince's ""Butterfly Girl (Pantha Lost the Beat Version)"" and the freefalling piano chords of Adolf ""DJ Koze"" Noise's ""Was Ist Zuviel Zeit? (Dub)"" and slides them across the big black headspace a good pair of headphones can create. His taste in beats tends towards the timbral/melodic as well; it's <em>five</em> tracks and a good <em>20</em> minutes before the recognizably jacking house boom-tick of Johannes Heil's ""Aquarius"" finally pokes its head above the surface of Thomas' aqueous mix, rippling like a lake under moonlight. The first half of <em>PPP</em> sounds like it should only be played around 4 a.m. at just-audible volume.</p><p>
    As <em>PPP</em> progresses, starting with the starved tribal house bongos and emaciated handclaps of Ricardo Villalobos' ""The Contempt (Trip Tollsmix)"" at the halfway mark, it picks up the pace with a string of beefy, if ultimately interchangeable, mid-tempo bangers, a slight capitulation to the fact that Thomas is supposed to be making a ""dance"" mix. This muscular middle peaks with the Detroit techno hi-hats and bouncy ball electro bassline of Reinhard Voigt's ""Suchtkultur"". And then, after an almost entirely instrumental hour, a charming (if cheesy) vocoder-hiccup cover of the Smiths' ""Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me"" by Brant featuring Mr. Roper sets up two leftfield diva tunes to close us out.</p><p>
    The baby's rattle electro beats of International Pony's ""Gravity"" are strung between tingly cartoon harp runs and keyboard trills coated with major label gloss, as the Pony playfully pitches up the kittenish female singer until she's as screechy as that Dan Deacon album. Thomas and Geiger's own remix of Stella's cover of Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" (follow all that?) mixes up live instruments (you can hear the frets squeaking), competent vocals (though hardly Nicks-ian), and a spacey New Order breakdown that then ditches the electric bass and jazzy drums for a spot-on early '90s techno pastiche. Like the rest of <em>PPP</em>, ultimately less of a state-of-the-nation dance mix than an idiosyncratic diversion, its inclusion is a sign that, though Thomas' mixing skills mean the disc flows smoothly, his ear for selection remains tuned to a very private channel.</p></div>"|10323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10323-please-please-please/|6.8|Jess Harvell

Note the number of fingers raised: One, the American-style middle finger, rather than the ""V"" more traditionally associated with obscene hand gestures in the UK. Whether or not it's an acknowledgment of his American audience, however, is almost irrelevant: Stateside fans can't walk into Target or Best Buy and look at the back cover firsthand. XL has limited American sales to digital distributors. That they made this decision for Dizzee's crucial third album, <em>Maths + English</em>-- a record that features his most Americanized production yet and a Yank-luring guest turn from Houston rappers UGK-- is a bit perplexing. Even if this decision turns out not to be a significant constraint on his American sales (or, let's go crazy here, somehow improves them), it says a lot about XL's lack of faith in the U.S. market for grime's international ambassador: Given how the notoriously fickle audience back home has gotten tired of waiting three years for the followup to <em>Showtime</em> and has gravitated towards the dubstep of Burial and Skream, Dizzee's best prospects for an expanded fanbase may well be across the pond.</p><p>
    Given his career arc, it's not impossible to see a precedent for a potential American breakthrough. With <em>Boy in Da Corner</em> as his scene's import-buzz breakthrough album, <em>Showtime </em>the self-conscious more-of-the-same-but-bigger effort, and now <em>Maths + English</em> as his post-genre American-mythos statement, Dizzee could very well be doing for hip-hop what many UK artists have done for rock: Reinvent its British adaptations on American terms and vice-versa. First single ""Sirens"" supposedly started as a KoRn pastiche, but it finished as the ungodly offspring of ""Straight Outta Compton"" and ""99 Problems"" (with a bit of Chemical-née-Dust Brothers' ""Song to the Siren"" thrown in). And album opener ""World Outside"" offers turbocharged ambiance, glassy percussive clinks, subwoofer-stressing bass, and a chorus that ends ""There's a world outside of the ghetto, and I want you to see it/ I can see it, I can see it, I can see it.""</p><p>
    It's easy to wonder if Dizzee is talking about more than one type of ghetto. You could hardly call the album on the whole ""grime"" without a qualifier or two, and only one track has a direct and uncontaminated lineage to his solo career's origins five years back: The belligerent touch-tone chirps of last track ""U Can't Tell Me Nuffin"", which shows up long after anyone who bothers to listen to the record in sequence will have discovered he's not making<em> Boy in Da Corner</em> anymore. And while it's impossible for any album where Dizzee's East London dialect figures prominently to be fully Americanized, there's a lot for the States to latch onto. </p><p>
    ""Pussyole (Old Skool)"" is the personification of this particular trans-Atlantic exchange: While the chorus hinges on a derisive term seldom heard in the States (at least past the second syllable), the beat is so instantly recognizable as the backbone of a beloved circa-88 club-rap smash that early leaks were described as riding the ""It Takes Two"" beat. (In a neat production twist, it also incorporates the sample source that was used in the intro to ""It Takes Two"", Galactic Force Band's 1978 astro-disco obscurity ""Space Dust"", but features an entirely different, more propulsive section of the original song.) There's other, newer-school forays into Southern turf: The spare, punchy post-No Limit synth strings and drum machine beats of ""Hardback (Industry)"", which sounds like it could've easily fit somewhere on Ludacris' <em>Back for the First Time</em>, the Timbaland slickness of flosser's anthem ""Bubbles"" and 2-step b-girl club banger ""Flex"", and the aforementioned UGK summit ""Where's Da G's"", which pulls off the admirable feat of sounding like grime when Dizzee's on the mic and Southern bounce/g-funk during Bun B and Pimp C's verses. The tail end of the album has its share of fellow Brits mopping things up guest-wise-- Lily Allen dominates the grating music-hall pseudo-ska ""Wanna Be"", while the Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner turns in a decent performance warbling the chorus of ""Temptation""-- but they don't set the tenor like the album's club-rap front half does.</p><p>
    The other major change in Dizzee's music-- some might say concession-- is his lyrical approach, which does less to cloak his rudimentary rhymes with busy pachinko-machine production and double-time verses. This is hardly a fault; like the circa-87 incarnations of Schoolly D or KRS-One, Dizzee's strength lies in the ability to wring ferocity out of uncluttered, straightforward verses. He shines when he gets philosophical about the police's role in the community on ""Excuse Me Please"", recounting the sickness and unease that came when robbing a couple on ""Sirens"", and seething with frustrated disappointment over the duplicity of an ex-friend (a maybe/maybe-not allusion to former Roll Deep mentor Wiley) on ""Pussyole"", but even the more well-worn hip hop subjects-- paranoia, phonies, how to survive the music industry-- flow viciously in a manner that's just about as good as anybody alive when it comes to completing the sound of a production. It works in a way that can't properly be evoked by just quoting lyrics; transcribing Dizzee's verses would be like printing the guitar tabs for ""Theme From Shaft"", reducing a point-blank gut-punch of a sound to its deceptively simple base elements. You could try, of course, and that'd make a track like ""Suck My Dick"" look like imbecilic bullshit -- ""I don't give a shit who likes it/ I don't give a shit who don't/ Don't tell me to change my fuckin' attitude because I won't"" -- but you'd miss the exaggerated schoolyard nyeah-nyeah inflections, the Lemmy-bassline cadence, and the sense of adolescent mischievousness that keeps it from becoming a self-serious, tiresome fuck-you tirade. You'd also miss the fact that those lines are accompanied by a bar of ""Yankee Doodle Dandy""-- he could be catering to American sensibilities on this album, but he's not caving into them.<br/></p></div>"|10309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10309-maths-english/|8.4|Nate Patrin

    Produced by Timbaland and co-written by Justin Timberlake, Rihanna's ""Rehab"" is a slight but solid entry into the rapidly-expanding Timbalake catalog. With its pillowy acoustic guitars and strings and rattling percussion, ""Rehab"" could hold its own against most of the second-half ballads from <em>FutureSex/LoveSounds</em>. But listening to the song, it's tough not to speculate how it might sound if Timberlake sang the whole thing rather than just the backing vocals. Timberlake's not Marvin Gaye or anything, but his falsetto is perfectly equipped to convey the track's plaintive, regretful sentiment. Rihanna, meanwhile...not so much. Here she comes closer than usual to depicting something resembling human emotion, but she still comes off sounding like a robot programmed to impersonate Alanis Morrissette. There's something puzzling about the way Def Jam has pulled out all the stops to anoint Rihanna as the world's newest pop superstar and to position <em>Good Girl Gone Bad</em> as its blockbuster summer tentpole. The chief characteristic of Rihanna's voice, after all, is a sort of knife-edged emptiness, a mechanistic precision that rarely makes room for actual feelings to bulldoze their way through. And that blankness, coupled with Rihanna's glaring lack of technical vocal skill, serve to make her a truly unlikely pop star.</p><p>
    In the past, Rihanna's best singles (""Pon de Replay"", ""S.O.S."") have camouflaged her weaknesses by reducing her voice to a chilly sound-effect, using her on tracks propulsive and streamlined enough that she doesn't have any room to do anything other than coo melodies over the top. On last year's Evanescence-esque ballad ""Unfaithful"", though, she sounded totally lost trying to execute r&amp;b runs that her voice just wasn't built to handle. Her current single ""Umbrella"" makes similar mistakes. The song's production gleams, but Rihanna's voice takes on an unpleasant icepick edge when she tries to fill the space between the slow-tempo beats. (A brain-numblingly awful Jay-Z verse helps nothing; it's like that guy's lost all interest in rapping.) ""Umbrella"" is uncompelling as event-pop, particularly because of the disconnect between Rihanna's cold, clinical delivery and the comforting warmth of the lyrics. Fortunately, most of <em>Good Girl Gone Bad</em> actually does the opposite, miraculously transforming Rihanna's all-consuming blankness into an aesthetic asset.</p><p>
    The majority of <em>Good Girl Gone Bad</em> doesn't qualify as r&amp;b even in its Ciara robo-diva form. Even the sleekest Ciara tracks revolve around projection of a certain emotional state: the kinetic thrill of dancing, the teasing self-assurance of denying admirers your goodies. But <em>Good Girl</em> is closer to teenpop territory, where sex and consumerism supersede personal connection. It's telling that a couple of the album's standout tracks come from Stargate, the Norwegian production team who made their name writing songs for posthuman British computer-pop entities like Mis-Teeq and Atomic Kitten. Stargate is responsible for the best track here, ""Don't Stop the Music"", an amazing bit of synth-bass Euroclub insanity; halfway through, sampled <em>mamasay-mamasa</em>s from Michael Jackson's ""Wanna Be Startin' Something"" come in and seamlessly blur into the track's overpowering beat. ""Push up on Me"" exploits the hell out of Rihanna's vocal similarities to any number of forgotten 80s Latin freestyle divas; she tries out a great clipped, staccato delivery over rapid-fire electro synth-blips. On ""Shut Up and Drive"", she sings about being a car looking for the right driver, appropriate considering that the song-- which samples New Order's ""Blue Monday""-- begins with über-processed new wave guitars that sort of sound like the Cars.
    </p>
<p>
    When <em>Good Girl Gone Bad</em> falters, it usually does so because Rihanna's been pushed too far into her slick comfort zone; ""Say It"" is an irritatingly trebly and thin track, and ""Question Existing"" rests on puerile psuedoporn lyrics about Rihanna staring at herself naked in a mirror. But the album pushes Rihanna's flat coo through a number of different musical contexts, always finding new ways to further gloss things up. And those ideas work way more often than not, so <em>Good Girl Gone Bad</em> makes for an unexpectedly varied and satisfying listen. She's still a long way away from developing a recognizable personality, but at this rate, she's never going to need one.

    I had the pleasure-- the privilege, really-- of seeing Dappled
    Cities live on their home turf of Sydney,
    Australia,
    several months ago. It's not every day or even every decade that I get to go to
    a concert in another hemisphere, and they put on a good show both times I saw
    them, once in an art gallery/clothing store and once in a club so sweaty the
    walls were dripping. What struck me even more, perhaps, was the row of utterly
    smitten expressions on the faces of the girls who crowded up to the front of
    the stages, sang along to every song and screamed their lungs out in the gaps
    between.</p><p>
    I think what I valued about the show was being able to
    experience a band that was trying to become an international entity on a local
    level, seeing those fans who'd watched the band grow up and looked up to them.
    The larger world will never understand a band in the same way as the people in
    its hometown, and it's background I wish I could get more often. Dappled
    Cities-- alternately known as Dappled Cities Fly-- have hopped stateside with the
    release of their second album, and it's a record that doesn't skimp on the
    grand gesture, opening with its most bluntly dramatic track.</p><p>
    The song is even called ""Holy Chord"", and it's a swelling,
    shimmering thing that announces the album with clipped verses that build up to
    a huge, grandiose falsetto hook. The band builds behind vocalist Tim
    Derricourt, finally leaping into a charge at the beginning of the third verse,
    where it begins building up again. The sound is built for an era where the
    Arcade Fire rules the indie rock world-- it's big and complex and pipelines emotion straight to your speakers. Derricourt shares lead
    vocals with fellow guitarist Dave Rennick and frequently plays the introverted foil
    to his partner's more theatrical presence. It keeps the album balanced and helps
    the flow considerably.
    </p>
<p>
    A frequently overlooked aspect of most great bands is the
    presence of an inventive drummer in the lineup, someone capable of more than just a standard beat. Hugh Boyce is such a drummer,
    and his work helps each song carve out a distinct identity behind its melody.
    ""Work It Out"" is the most obvious example of this, with its thundering,
    staccato snare runs and sizzling crash cymbal, but even his more subtle moments
    can subtly transform a song. On ""Beach Song"", for instance, he rides the toms
    on one and three, creating a heartbeat effect behind Ned Cooke's drifting
    keyboards. 
    </p>
<p>
    He brings this approach to the album's most obvious single,
    the sweeping, mid-tempo ""Fire Fire Fire"", which opens with a fanfare that
    sounds like it could either be guitars or keyboards or both. The song's
    delivery is restrained, even subdued, but it still sticks in your head right
    away-- its very restraint is probably a big part of what makes the moments where
    Rennick and Derricourt double each other or break into falsetto even more
    memorable. On ""Vision Bell"", the vocals trade off falsetto and normal lines,
    giving the song a conversational back-and-forth that draws you in. Bassist Alex
    Moore holds back until the second verse, and when he drops in, it completely
    changes the feel of the song, the way a rip tide changes the feel of a
    leisurely swim.
    </p>
<p>
    Dappled Cities are a mature band with a highly evolved sense of
    songcraft and arrangement. Aside from merely writing them, they know how to
    inhabit songs and make them breathe. It's that quality elevates <em>Granddance</em> beyond being simply good and
    makes it occasionally border on great.

It's kind of a reverse Wizard of Oz effect: Paying attention to the people behind the aural curtain makes their creations even more magical-- or at least trickier than the sounds alone might suggest. I've never seen Jazzkammer, the Norwegian duo of John Hegre and Lasse Marhaug, but based on their busy recorded output and mysterious use of guitar and electronics, my bet is they're fascinating to watch. I have seen Howard Stelzer, and he definitely is.  The Boston-based sound artist works mostly with cassette tapes, and the way he exploits this fading technology-- discovering sounds in rewinds, hiss, and dirt-- is a unique sight.</p><p>
    Given their intriguing methods, it's hard not to think of recordings by Stelzer and Jazzkammer as half-experiences, like a TV show with the sound turned off.  But their records are really starting points-- calling cards for the audiovisual experience each offers in concert.  <em>Tomorrow No One Will Be Safe</em>, taken from a 2004 Jazzkammer/Stelzer American jaunt, certainly contains enough interesting sonic matter to tide anyone over until either act's next tour.</p><p>
    The first cut, ""Requiem for Officer Bobby Barker"", is by Jazzkammer alone.  It begins nearly silent, with small, creaking sounds that evoke the minimalism of AMM.  As the pair gradually distribute metallic clangs, morse-code-like blips, and filtered static, their swelling mix becomes like a wordless shortwave radio conversation.  That the piece ends with a noisy maelstrom might be predictable, but it's the way Jazzkammer gets there-- building noise through patient, organic construction-- that's the surprise.</p><p>
    Stelzer follows with a stranger solo piece, ""Last Night at BLD"".  His sounds don't build so much as they randomly fire, shooting all over the place without any obvious interest in meshing or melding.  Springy twangs, warping scratches, and the sound of tape rolling over playheads all create a cartoon soundtrack without the music.  Close your eyes and you can almost see the ACME products exploding in time to Stelzer's picturesque noise.</p><p>
    Most compelling is the collaborative, album-ending title track.  Stelzer's tape warps chime in immediately, tempered by Jazzkammer's low guitar rumbles and electronic slashes.  Loops of noise provide rhythm here and there, but the main attraction is the connective tissue that the three use to string their noises into arcs.  Jump around the track and you'll swear all these different sounds couldn't possibly fit together, but somehow Stelzer and Jazzkammer make it all stick through simple listening and response. Whatever the shortcomings of improvised noise on record, releases like this are the only chance most people will get to hear these two Norwegian noise hounds meld minds with a Massachusetts tape addict.  As such, <em>Tomorrow No One Will Be Safe</em> is a pretty valuable document.<br/></p></div>"|10301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10301-tomorrow-no-one-will-be-safe/|7.0|Marc Masters

""Blinding Light"" ends the trio's second album with Kathryn Calder imparting a bit of wisdom for those who feel they might have lost their way: ""Sometimes when you're going down, you're going down no matter what.  Find the deepest well you can and climb on in and wait it out.""  Her retreat-and-wait mode of problem solving seems most appropriate for a child-- how many adults have Aesop on their bookshelves, after all-- and it appropriately draws to a gentle close a record that, not unlike a super-hip pre-school teacher, turns pop songs into proverbs.</p><p>
    Enthusiasm is not, ironically enough, something that Immaculate Machine approaches lightly. <em>Fables</em> has energy and vitality to spare, but any emotional release is consistently tempered by intimations for better living.  ""Jarhand"", the record's most effusive track, opens the LP with a ramp toward a pub-chant coda (sung by Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos and his new discovery the Cribs, who were recording at the same studio) that<br/>
    echoes Calder's occasional dalliances with the New Pornographers.  Like so many A.C. Newman songs, ""Jarhand"" also packs cryptically-worded, foreboding lyrics (""always want what you don't understand,"" then ""your time is coming up"") into a buoyant, shape-shifting melody.  Second track ""Dear Confessor"" continues the group's fiercely advisory power-pop spirit, warning those searching for treasure to trust their instincts, keeping in mind that ""maps won't show us where we're going.""</p><p>
    ""C'mon Sea Legs"" effectively reverses Calder's suggestions from ""Light"", urging the most delicate form of action:  ""come on now, put a sweater on and go outside for a while.""  The song opens with guitarist Brooke Gallupe alone on vocals, exposing his strained croon, which he augments with bits of dramatic affect substituting for range.  Calder joins Gallupe for the second half, and the song expands into a construction-paper wave of gentle encouragement.  Calder's voice is as spindly and emphatic as Gallupe's is deliberate and smug, yet both come across with a youthful fervor that outpaces either's ability.  The duo's harmonies thus become one of <em>Fables</em>' most memorable components, coming to full fruition on the foreboding ""Old Flame"", which more or less sounds like Archie and Veronica trying on the icy passion of John Doe and Exene Cervenka.  It's a fine pallette from which to work, leading the song to its well-earned fiery conclusion.  </p><p>
    The band wears didacticism well, but the album's catechizing can feel a become a bit cumbersome and murky at times.  This makes the Machine's enlisting of arranger-for-hire Owen Pallett seem like a perfect idea, and, as advertised, he leaves his clearly recognizable mark on two of Fables's best songs.  Pallett's strings creep in for the middle-eight of ""Roman Statues"" like the French horn in the Beatles' ""For No One"", and smear the sinuous ""Small Talk"" throughout with an airy, august drama.  </p><p>
<em>Fables</em> seems designed to be heard as an anthology of songs-- one that
    loosely uses the ideals, if not necessarily the style, of its literary
    predecessor-- and as such, doesn't present a uniform message, but a
    collection of disparate ones.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, <em>Fables</em> is least effective when its lessons are aimed inward instead of toward whomever might be within earshot.  There's nothing particularly wrong with a song like ""Nothing Ever Happens"", which sees the band go full-on into pop-punk ennui, but it feels out of place surrounded by its more lyrically adventurous counterparts.  Gallupe's voice temporarily channels Will Sheff on ""Pocket"", and his strident amorousness (""I'm out looking for sex but all I get is love"") does nothing as a penultimate song but starkly contrast with Calder's skittish closer.  When <em>Fables</em> succeeds, and it does more often than not, its songs tackle the tenuous stage of young life when quests for knowledge are pushed aside by harsh realities, offering well-intentioned advice to navigate these moments.  It's a pious sentiment indeed, perhaps best summed up with a lyric from ""Small Talk"": ""The big ideas somehow snuck in when we weren't looking, and scared away the light-hearted laughter of our innocence.""</p></div>"|10319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10319-immaculate-machines-fables/|6.7|Eric Harvey

The struggle of DIY indie bands can be over-romanticized, but in the case of Blitzen Trapper, the freedom to work at their own pace is most likely what brought them to come up with the cock-eyed stylistic blitzkrieg of <em>Wild Mountain Nation</em>. The steps up to it have been hesitant: The band's first two albums adhered to both earnest country-derived conventions and a modern disregard for the constraints of genre, somehow reconciling these two impulses to cook up perfectly listenable, if somewhat tentative, pop on tracks like ""Summer Twin"", ""Asleep for Days"", and ""Texaco"", to name a few. But aside from a few songs worth cherry-picking, none showed the work of a group destined for the spotlight-- or, for that matter, capable of deciding between being an alt-country revival act or boundary-blurring experimentalists.</p><p>
    It's better for all of us they've refused to focus. While I'm loathe to make a Pavement reference (lo-fi recordings! Slackers with guitars!!1!), <em>Wild Mountain Nation</em> comes closer to catching the carefree fuck-off sprawl of <em>Wowee Zowee</em> than any record in recent memory. Here the band sail through any number of genres and styles without giving off a whiff of effort, their apparent West coast breeziness covering for the judicious amount of detail crammed into nearly every song. Opener ""Devil's a Go-Go"" undermines its windmilling guitars with stuttering, unpredictable rhythm; those same hiccups slide inauspiciously into the unrepentant country/southern-rock of the title track. Singer Eric Earley double-tracks himself with as much personality as his reedy voice can muster, but there's a ringer somewhere in the Blitzen Trapper's pack of guitarists-- some Guitar Center regional manager bending notes with optimal precision, lifting these songs to more authentic peaks. Elsewhere, the prim and proper indie pop of ""Futures &amp; Folly"" collides with the snarling glam rave-up of ""Miss Spiritual Tramp"" (which features a brief harmonica and, swear to god, a jaw-harp hoedown). The canny snake-charmer guitar line of ""Sci-Fi Kid"" fits easily on any satellite radio playlist, yet here it's next to the gleefully raucous carnival stomp of ""Woof &amp; Warp of the Quiet Giant's Hem"". All of them demand equal attention on a dizzyingly sequenced album.</p><p>
    Compared to their previous albums, <em>Wild Mountain Nation</em> has a newfound and audible confidence. It's the work of an assured band who can not only treat genre like so much fingerpaint, but brave enough to play it straight for a minute-- not as an empty exercise, but a chance to aspire. ""Summer Town"" is the record's big breather, a washed-out AM country ballad on which Earley sings slowly and carefully through his most arresting lyrics while a harmonica, its tone sweet and simple, cements the song's yearning. Closing tracks ""Country Caravan"" and the western slowpoke ""Badger's Black Brigade"" are chummy and unpretentious sing-alongs, and while the former comes a little too close to the Eagles for comfort, it's only because of its fantastically broad but contagious melody. The home run, though, is the title track, conjuring up easy freedom-rock images and Last Waltz montages, but forget nostalgia and influence for just a moment: The whole song swings, the guitars bend as proudly and woozily as teenagers with stolen six-packs, and on every clear enunciation and careful slur, you can hear Earley's grin.
    </p><p>
    But as diverse as it is, and as joyous as it is, <em>Wild Mountain Nation</em> just has songs worth coming back to. It's the title track's early vocal hook that begs you to replay it before anything else, and then maybe the fact that it's so crammed with slide guitars that the edges glisten. The gentle, almost uptight pop (comparatively) of ""Futures &amp; Folly"" bely its resilient melody, as it's the nugget that holds up best after repeated listens. I could list more highlights-- like, the downtuned dark horse ""Hot Tip/Tough Cub"", or playful glam tribute ""Murder Babe"", or or or-- but if you're down with the diversity and can sit still while the band tears through every idea it has left, <em>Wild Mountain Nation</em> is a revelation from beginning to end.

Even as far back as 2004, on the heels of the <em>Kompakt 100</em> remix collection, Pitchfork techno guru Philip Sherburne pointed out in a <em>The Wire</em> magazine review that Kompakt's tenuous unity had already begun to crack into a confederacy of sub-labels-- Kompakt Pop, Kompakt Extra, and later K2-- all devoted to specialized tweaks on the sound of a label as catholic as any German techno imprint. Kompakt Extra was for the Speicher series, and the distinction made sense. The Speicher records were, at least in the arena of continental European post-techno, out-and-out bangers designed for maximum shirts-off, popper-fueled dancefloor humping. That wasn't something a DJ could always be sure of with a regular Kompakt release. Whatever the individual sound, Speicher releases always had a certain functional consistency-- a brand identity as it were.</p><p>
<em>Speicher 3</em>, the latest ""digital mix"" of recent Speicher singles by Kompakt's Michael Mayer and Jörg Burger, is proof that over the last few years either Kompakt's regular roster (many of which appear here anyway) has moved closer to the sound of Speicher or vice versa. Whereas Kompakt's early 00s mixes were often mid-tempo, melodic, and stuffed with quirky choices, there's far less difference between <em>Speicher 3</em> and Michael Mayer's techno-focused <em>Immer 2</em> on plain' ol Kompakt. For sure <em>Speicher 3</em> is still closer to something you'd hear on a Friday night than Tobias Thomas' recent, crepuscular come down mix <em>Please Please Please</em>. But now the rest of the clubbing world has caught up to Kompakt's version of minimal techno, or maybe it's Kompakt that's caught up to the rest of the clubbing world's version of minimal techno. A track like Superpitcher's ""Enzian"" retains the unearthly quality (those reverb-slurred chimes, for instance) that spreads like mist in a Hammer horror flick through much of his work, but the paired electro-house rhythm running underneath the briny mix means the dancefloor will stay full when the needle hits the groove.</p><p>
    Typical for a <em>Speicher</em> collection, the mix is fairly uniform in terms of tempo and structure, and as usual with Kompakt in straight-ahead mode (and minimal techno in general), the trick to enjoying <em>Speicher 3</em> is often about the ability to get lost in the each track's devilish details. Jurgen Paape's ""Fruity Loops #2"" is simultaneously the mix's most propulsive couple of minutes--that surging bassline splitting the difference between deep house and Detroit techno--and its most lovingly finessed, kitted out with multiple layers of shivery synth pads, clanging piano chords, and Italo disco arpeggios. But hewing to the series' stated mission of body moving, most of <em>Speicher 3</em>'s best tracks stick to the basic writ of hypnotizing dancers first and getting fussy with the sonics later, like Axel Bartsch stringing nothing but his percolating, compulsive handclaps across a bottomless pit of black low-end on ""Deal"". John Dahlback's ""Wet Summer"" squrims with pointillist synth blips and gurgles like a bucket full of robot grubs, but Misc's roid-raging post-acid house splurts and spizz over a jacking beat on ""Status Now"" revel in the restrictive pleasures of dance classicism.</p><p>
<em>Speicher 3</em> will be comforting terra cognita for longtime Kompakt fans, and like all Kompakt mixes, it takes a little while to move into first gear, Mayer and Burger continually preferring a long-view percussive tease to one hammering climax after another. The mix's <em>actual</em> climax, Motiivi:Tuntematon's ""Mankind Failed"", is almost an <em>anti</em>-climax, four minutes of charging drums that fizzle like a snuffed match only to flame up again into an atonal breakdown of gnarled, mile-high synthesizers and distorted digital feedback that's left to play out in all its 8:58 sturm-und-drang intensity. It's the ugliest sound Kompakt has ever pressed to vinyl, sounding more like a selection from Kevin Drumm's <em>Sheer Hellish Miasma</em>, and an utterly perverse way to close out a dance mix, even a dark one. If any artist on <em>Speicher 3</em> is one to watch, it's these three Finns, and even if it's not ""the point,"" the mix could have used a few more curveballs like ""Mankind Failed"". There's a point where brand consistency teeters on the edge of contemptible familiarity, after all.</p></div>"|10318.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10318-speicher-3/|6.4|Jess Harvell

Cex's vaunted aversion to continuity holds up-- all that remains from his last release, <em>Actual Fucking</em>, is a reprisal of that record's ""Denton"" (on ""Damon Kvols"") and similarly eye-catching graphic design.</p><p>
<em>Actual Fucking</em>'s cover depicted a guy jizzing, in big comic book droplets, on a girl's arched back.  <em>Sketchi</em> one-ups its predecessor with an altered still from <em>Twins</em>: A black cloud of smoke pours out of Danny DeVito, obscuring most of Arnold Schwarzenegger. In place of DeVito's face is an explosion and a collaged-in cloud of debris.  We're meant to recall the World Trade Center towers at the moment they came down-- Kidwell's provocations just don't stop.</p><p>
    Whether it's worth overcoming whatever reaction this elicits in you, I have no idea.  As it happens, <em>Sketchi</em> is one of Cex's best records: rhythmically convincing, menacingly dark. Distance and space are what Kidwell's added: The skittish, distant drum-and-bass of ""Rattler Bin"" comes as if from three or four blocks away, while  ""Camber Sands"" expands indefinitely out of a single sound, something like a hollow pipe falling to the ground. Late-period Boredoms and Cex's fellow Baltimore noise act Wzt Hearts come to mind on tracks such as the ocean-steady ""Goober Says"".</p><p>
    Plus, Kidwell's endemic hostility to his own audience finally comes in handy.  His new songs, in their repetitive cruelty, are more affecting for being abusive. ""Damon Kvols"", <em>Sketchi</em>'s restless opener, adds inaudible, howling chants and moans to an already centerless bass and impatient delay; the discomfort of the stray sounds and the low end's relentless pulse only multiplies over the track's 10 minutes.  Kidwell strips away all the extras-- including his recently ubiquitous vocals-- to bring you face-to-face with the almost sickeningly steady motion often hidden within his compositions.</p><p>
    Does anybody actually listen to old Cex records?  One byproduct of Kidwell's experiments has been to firmly date each record of his, in sequence.  But it's hard to imagine him being able to derail <em>Sketchi</em> and its persuasive simplicity, even if he doesn't make another record like it.<br/></p></div>"|10306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10306-sketchi/|7.0|Zach Baron

    That's it: Fire the drummer. Though it's a problematic if
    long-standing complaint, Pelican drummer Larry Herweg has consistently
    prevented his Chicago-based instrumental four-piece from being as transcendent as they've long been touted. On their third album, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">City
    of Echoes</span><span>, it's worse than it's ever been,
    largely because it now seems that the excellent and consistently developing
    guitar duo of Laurent Schroeder-Lebec and Trevor de Brauw are better than
    <em>they've</em> ever been. The compositions and performances have become more subtle
    and complex and, here, are occasionally as powerful as those early Pelican
    moments, when a young, passionate band would grind a handful of chords into fine,
    red-hot dust. But Herweg, unlike his flanking guitarists and even his bassist
    brother Bryan, hasn't progressed beyond his role of generally beating things
    hard and misguiding the upswing of a song by botching fills and missing beats.
    On </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">City of Echoes</span><span>, he muddles
    some of the album's most otherwise-transcendent moments, the album's approach
    of more density and less repetition giving him more opportunities for failure
    than ever before. Plenty of them are requited. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    This complaint is nothing new. Long before Pelican were
    popularly associated with the post-rock cadre that includes Explosions in the
    Sky, Mono, and a dozen other post-<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Young Team</span><span>
    acts, Kid606 mentioned that the band, drum machine and all, reminded him
    favorably of Godflesh. Oops. At this year's South by Southwest, one writer
    noted Herweg seemed to be made of wood. But </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">City of Echoes </span><span>demands a different drummer with finesse and a wide
    toolkit. After all, this is Pelican's big shot at making a more concise and
    dense album. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">City of Echoes</span><span> edges
    45 minutes, while 2005's </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw</span><span> was 14 minutes longer with one less track. Here Pelican spent more time compacting
    things, excising prior largesse, and letting each part stand out more by
    raising the contrast. As de Brauw told </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Decibel </span><span>reporter Andrew Parks in a fantastic, blunt feature,
    ""There was an intensity that wasn't there before in our songwriting-- a real
    heightened sense of awareness of each other's parts and a desire to write
    really compact, perfect songs."" </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But that entails a wider range of dynamics and a higher
    number of changes in less time, two qualities that lay a series of snare traps
    for Herweg. Consider the title track, the only piece here that breaks the
    seven-minute mark. The ideas warrant such length: Schroeder-Lebec and de Brauw
    diverge and converge, ricocheting between calculated broods and angular charges
    with guitar lines stretching as catapults. Less than two minutes in, half of
    the guitar duo is sprinting in sludge while the other is serializing a triumphant,
    ascending pattern. But if something sounds like it's unraveling, it is: As he
    does with almost all of his transitional movements, Herweg falls apart by a hit
    or two, chopping his hands and losing his place. It's awkward and unnatural, detracting
    from the intended motion entirely. Pelican proper sounds so good here, really:
    They're as aggressive and brimming as they are patient and smart, writing an
    anthem harmed by corrupted technique.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But it's not that Herweg simply can't<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> play</span><span>; he can't </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">place</span><span> properly in the band's evolving approach, either. Herweg sits the
    record's acoustic midsection out, but he spoils the album's other quiet track,
    closer ""A Delicate Sense of Balance"". He understeps his pace on a simple
    turn-around, but even when on point, his big, lumbering drums sound cumbersome and
    stiff. The guitars snake; he stomps, occasionally subdiving his beat without
    any awareness for the rest of the band. By the time the track peaks, Herweg
    stays in place. And, when one of the guitars finally trails off for the
    dénouement, Herweg's sore thumb is still there, negating delicacy. Herweg's drumming and complete oblivion to feel doesn't
    allow Pelican the range to be the exciting, dynamic band that's capable
    of the structural complexity they're interested in here. This makes
    <em>City of Echoes</em> static and, often, boring.
    </span>
</p>
    Ignoring the rhythm section and its side effects, though, this is the best
    Pelican album yet, largely because de Brauw and Schroeder-Lebec are only
    getting better in tandem, increasingly comfortable as complementary foils. On
    ""Far From Fields""-- one of the disc's late-breaking, open-vista tracks-- one
    guitarist embraces textural sweeps while the other builds through a surface
    staccato motion. Both guitars eventually arrive together, on top, flipping
    between near-harmonies and counterpoints. It's a special moment, pure
    finesse. Behind his kit, though, just as the guitars open up and soak in the
    shimmer of their sound, Herweg sounds like he's staring down, grimacing and
    just heave-hoeing, sticks in hands, oblivious to the aural eclipse happening
    feet away. If you focus too hard on how Herweg's trying to keep up (with
    himself?) and failing, you could miss the beauty of that moment, too. Or you
    could simply continue to demand more from this ""[quasi-] triumphant
    band.""

    At least with most bands working from the ground up, you'd be getting something weird. Unlistenable, maybe, but still weird enough to justify its small niche-audience release. Putting something so benign as Sean Na Na's latest, however, on an independent label like Dim Mak just strikes me as lazy, but singer/songwriter Sean Tillmann (Har Mar Superstar) needs an outlet for every persona-- even the bland ones. The most subversive band Sean Na Na  recall on <em>Family Trees</em> is the goddamn Shins. From the squeaky clean guitar lead to its superfluous baby-mobile keyboards and Tillmann's sudden over-reaching yelp, opener ""We've Been Here Before"" uncannily recalls James Mercer &amp; co. (that cover isn't helping), but marching in a midtempo lock-step rhythm where the Shins would have reached for something with an ounce of color or personality.</p><p>
    But whether they're clutching at someone else's coattails isn't the problem. If these songs were played by a four-piece guitar/drums/bass, some multi-instrumental indie band with a baseball-team roster, a midi orchestra, or a klezmer ensemble, they'd still be duller than a golf pencil simply because they aspire to so little. Tillmann's reaching on the opening track is about as exciting as it gets; on ""Don't Look Me Sideways"", he sounds like a understudy for a barbershop quartet, singing softly in his apartment so as not to wake the neighbors while the band putters away in the kitchen. Whatever aesthetic they're going for here-- 1970s power pop, 80s college-rock, or maybe more just 90s  rootsy innocuousness (wither the Counting Crows and, alas, Fastball)-- it sounds muddled, indecisive, and limp. I can barely recall another band playing it so annoyingly safe.</p><p>
    But the singer's voice is operatic compared to the range of his actual band. After the first half of this record, I wanted something, anything, to expand beyond their dorm-room pick-up band skiffle. Then I heard the leaden face-plant attempt to rock out with ""The Hunter"", and the first half didn't seem so bad after all. As a matter of fact, ""Fold, Hit, or Stand"" conjures up a vague country-influence with the twang of a  staccato guitar line and barroom piano. The lyrics, too, nearly elevate this power-pap to something stirring. They're often dark and introspective against the otherwise perky backdrops, populated by characters like the burnouts of ""Don't Look Me Sideways"", or the stressed baby daddy in ""Fold, Hit, or Stand"", or the jilted lover/voyeur in ""Can't Get a Spark"". Dark lyrics on top of happy music is a gimmick older than radio, and unfortunately, it's about the only thing <em>Family Trees</em> has going for it. <br/>

    I don't expect to hear too many complaints about the rating above. <em>Daydream Nation</em> is a great uniter: You'd be hard pressed to find many fans of indie rock who don't have some love for this record. That's partly because this record is great, sure-- that's one boring reason-- but it's also because this record is one of a handful that helped shape the notion of what American indie rock can potentially mean. It's almost a tautology: Indie fans love <em>Daydream Nation</em> because loving stuff like <em>Daydream Nation</em> is part of how we define what indie fans <em>are</em>.</p><p>
    Not that there wasn't plenty of underground music in the U.S. before this album's 1988 release-- hardcore punk, high-art avant garde, quirky college rock, DIY, weirdo regional scenes. But the notion that all those Reagan-era discontents might be in the same boat-- a new Alternative Nation just beginning to converge-- hadn't yet been fully articulated. Sonic Youth sensed that convergence in the making, and they were pretty sure it had something to do with Dinosaur Jr.: ""A new aesthetic of youth culture"", Thurston Moore called it in Matthew Stearns' 33 1/3 book about the album, ""wherein anger and distaste, attributes associated with punk energy, were coolly replaced by head-in-the-clouds outer limits brilliance."" Right. So the band writes the most glorious, accessible pop song of its career, calling it ""J Mascis for President""-- i.e., an underground-rock campaign song-- and it kicks off this record under the title ""Teen Age Riot"". What does that sound like if not the grand calling-together of a nascent underground audience?</p><p>
    Sonic Youth don't set the song up as a call to arms. Instead, Thurston, singing, is in bed, just like you might be while listening to it-- or to <em>Bug</em>, or <em>Surfer Rosa</em>, or <em>Isn’t Anything</em>, all of which came within the same year. Just two motes of potential energy, both waiting for Mascis to ""Come running in on platform shoes/ With [his] Marshall stack/ To at least just give us a clue."" <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=6rgBPMMJtIg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>The video for this song</strong></a> contains more images of musicians who <em>aren't </em>in Sonic Youth than musicians who are: Ian MacKaye, Patti Smith, Mark E. Smith, Iggy Pop, Black Flag, Sun Ra, Daniel Johnston, Neil Young, the Beach Boys-- a crash course in what still, almost 20 years later, looks like an indie canon.</p><p>
    Following that, the band spends this double album managing to inhabit just about every major strain of the underground, collecting and referencing each facet of what this ""new youth culture"" might look like:<br/></p>
<ul><li>avant-garde Downtown NYC new music, complete with odd harmonic collisions and screwdrivers wedged in guitars</li>
<li>hardcore punk sneering and double-time drumbeats</li>
<li>good old off-kilter, accessible collegiate pop music</li>
<li>gorgeous, oceanic ""head-in-the-clouds outer limits"" guitar stuff, which-- along with the previous year's releases from My Bloody Valentine, Dinosaur Jr., and the Pixies-- would define indie rock's guitar vocabulary as much as anything this side of Joy Division/New Order<br/></li>
<li>high-art, film, and literary references, ranging from the album cover (a Gerhard Richter painting) to the lyrics (which borrow from an Andy Warhol film and books by Harry Crews and Denis Johnson-- and this is <em>before </em>Denis Johnson published <em>Jesus’ Son</em>)</li>
<li>giant tongue-<em>near</em>-cheek rock gestures, like including a three-part ""trilogy"" and four Led Zeppelin-style icons representing the band members</li>
<li>slacker poses and goofy skater-kid trash culture</li>
<li>ambitious art-world braininess</li>
<li>this</li>
<li>that</li>
<li>the other<br/></li>
</ul><p>
    All melted down into one lump: ""Seamless"" isn't even the word.</p><p>
    Of course, now that a whole genre's grown out from <em>Daydream Nation</em>'s<em> </em>roots, all its ""difficult"" sounds, modified guitars, and strange collisions have become <em>de riguer</em>, invisible, and normalized, more clearly revealing the shimmering pop epics that always lay beneath. What's really shocking is the energy of it. This record's default setting is the place most rock bands try to work up to around the third chorus-- guitar players veering off into neck-strangling improvisations, singers dropping off the melody and into impassioned shouts. These songs <em>start</em> there and just stay. Usually the guitars spend a few bars wandering off and into sideways tangles, choking out their harmonies, and then come back together and spend a few bars pinning down the riff: On ""'Cross the Breeze"", that means Kim Gordon keeps returning to the same refrain, each time grunting it more insistently than the last. Sometimes they don't even stay there: Lee Ranaldo's ""Hey Joni"" starts off already on some next level of energy, and then Lee shouts ""kick it!"" and the band ratchets up to some <em>next </em>next level, and then he coasts up to one exhilarating shouted ""HEY!"" and the band bursts through a ceiling higher than you could have imagined at the start of the track. It's the kind of transcendent glory that crosses genres and even arts: that same in-the-zone feeling you get from a be-bop combo in top gear, a rapper at the absolute clear-eyed peak of his game-- hell, even an athlete in perfect function.</p><p>
    Lyrically, it's Thurston who turns in the rock slacker trash: When he's not just lying in bed, he's wandering around downtown Manhattan, getting mugged, blowing up amplifiers, and talking in a stoned skater-kid argot (""you got to fake out the robot!""). Lee, being Lee, exists on some more mystical future/past plane, located in dreams and open fields instead of on the Bowery. Kim's lyrics are the brutal, terrifying ones, each song outlining a flirtation with some demonic jerk. In ""Kissability"", it's a rotten entertainment mogul, pledging ""you could be a star"" and probably playing with himself under his desk. In ""Eliminator Jr"", it's Robert Chambers, the teenage rich-kid ""Preppy Murderer"", and a horrible little shit even before he raped and strangled Jennifer Levin behind the Met in Central Park. In ""'Cross the Breeze"", it may be the devil himself.  
    </p>
<p>
    This reissue does what reissues have to do these days, raising the volume to compete with all the over-compressed new stuff on your mp3 player. Someone's clearly taken care with the process, making sure not to spoil the wide dynamics of this music, but this kind of re-master isn't the best fit for the open-room feel of the original: I'd be lying if I said the crystalline brambles of guitar in these songs didn't suffer a little from being flattened out like this. (Steve Shelley's busy, subtle drumming gets a particularly raw deal.) Mild audiophiles-- or anyone attached to the feel of the original CD and LP issues-- might want to spring for the vinyl re-release.</p><p>
    On the plus side, this package is well aware that <em>Daydream Nation</em> is for celebrating <em>Daydream Nation</em>, and that there are already record stores where you can spend a year's salary on Sonic Youth rarities. Never mind the four covers included, or the home demo of ""Eric's Trip"" that quietly fades out the album disc: The treat, for this album's devotees, is a terrific, seamless collection of album-contemporary live performances, touching on every song on the album. (Yes, even ""Providence"".) It's a thrill, and not just for those who've heard this record enough times to need a fresh perspective. <em>Daydream Nation</em> was one great, liberated scribble on the mostly blank slate of what underground rock was starting to become, and through these tracks you get to hear the band take it out on the road and show it to everyone-- playing loose, sliding energetically through things they made precise on record. And, 12 tracks in, taking their J Mascis campaign song on a Straight Talk Expressway to Yr Skull.

    I poked fun at Darkel's ""Be My Friend""
    when I first <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/38993-darkel"">reviewed</a></strong>
    it, but that was probably the best track on Air lunar safarian Jean-Benoît
    Dunckel's disappointingly limp solo outing. Still, it came as a surprise to see
    this relatively sleepy song chosen to start the newest compilation by Paris-based label Kitsuné, which along with neighbor Ed Banger has played a huge role the
    past couple of years in expanding the intersection between indie rock and dance
    music. The best selections on the previous three <em>Kitsuné Maison</em> comps tended to be more muscular: Hot Chip, Klaxons,
    Simian Mobile Disco...hell, even underrated Swedish synth-popper Jenny Wilson. Darkel's
    fey, mid-tempo tune about forever friendship wouldn't be my first pick to get a
    party started.</p><p>
    So maybe it's a declaration of intent. Air can hardly be
    considered ""dance"", but they were one group both rock fans and
    electronic-music obsessives could agree on in the mid- to late-90s. They
    got pretty big, scoring Sofia Coppola films and landing whichever TV commercial
    placements Moby didn't, without sacrificing much critical esteem. Sure, the
    mid-80s PBS vibe of the synths on ""Be My Friend"" does jibe with the
    analogue nostalgia of some other <em>Kitsuné
    Maison </em>inclusions. But what the track lacks in dancefloor-friendly beats it
    may make up for in symbolism. Like: Axes, keyboards, it don't matter. And: This
    stuff is getting pretty big; Klaxons are on MTV.</p><p>
<em>Kitsuné Maison 4 </em>is
    another solid collection of previously 12""-only releases that stretch
    across the indie-dance axis. Some of the best cuts will already be familiar to
    most readers who keep track of this stuff, which it's still tempting to call
    silly names like ""nu rave"" or ""blog house"". The intoxicated
    blips and fractured loops of Thieves Like Us' ""<strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/42148-thieves-like-us-drugs-in-my-body"">Drugs
    in My Body</a></strong>"" accompany a frail indie-dude vocal, appropriate for
    going out or coming down. Feist's ""My Moon My Man"", <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/42184-feist-my-moon-my-man-boys-noize-remix-stream"">remixed</a></strong>
    here by Boyz Noize but originally from this year's excellent <em>The Reminder</em>, proves pleasantly
    well-suited to dry dance beats, robot guest vox, and a jerky bass groove. Adam
    Sky's remix of ""La Musique"", by Australian dance-poppers Riot in Belgium, adds sleazy
    electronics to a French-language club stomper. Fellow Aussies (and Kitsuné
    faves) Van She have remixed this track and <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/42403-dragonette-i-get-around-van-she-remix-mp3"">also</a></strong>  Dragonette's ""I Get Around"". The latter
    appears here in a Midnight Juggernauts mix, with sparkling, filtered synths
    around Martina Sorbara's digitally tweaked vocals about doing the wrong thing and feeling pretty right. 
    </p>
<p>
    There are pleasant surprises, too. Rambunctious Toronto duo Crystal
    Castles take a bewitched, bewitching turn on ""Knights"", which keeps
    their trademark 8-bit squiggles but buries a dolorous vocal in nocturnal
    distortion. Grime-informed UK
    band Hadouken! chat up a girl who's ""fit but fucking boring"" on
    ""Tuning In (H! Re-Rub)"", which sounds like the Streets for places with
    ridiculous cover charges and no jukebox. ""Yes, I've got a nice place/ And
    I don't mind, we can walk at your pace,"" frontman James Smith spits. The
    sing-song vox and stripped-down groove of Whitey's electro-folk ""Stay on the
    Outside"" is just a monster Led Zeppelin mash-up away from a White Stripes
    song.
    </p>
<p>
    OK, is the Kitsuné aesthetic ready for its media close-up? Yeah, in all likelihood, though perhaps thanks more to Simian Mobile Disco,
    Klaxons, and Ed Banger's Justice than <em>Kitsuné
    Maison 4</em>, which still lacks any tracks as instantly godly as those artists' best
    works. Nevertheless, the latest compilation shows what diverse results this approach may yield, from the guitar-driven dance-punk of London band Punks Jump
    Up's ""Dance to Our Disco"" (closer to Shy Child on the Rapture-Radio 4
    spectrum) to the rocking, Justice-like electro of Los Angelenos Guns N Bombs on
    ""Crossover Appeal"". Kelly, watch the charts.

    When Brooklyn noise fiend Carlos Giffoni set out for Japan last fall, he had
    just about finished his first all-analog solo album, <em>Arrogance</em>. Sticking
    to computer-less mode, he dubbed his five-date Far East jaunt ""The Synth
    Destruction Tour."" At a duo show with Merzbow, Giffoni was surprised to
    find Masami Akita in a similar mode. The King of Japanese Noise also chose to
    play the gig with only analog equipment, including his infamous homemade
    instrument comprised of springs and junk metal. It was the first time Akita had
    worked without a laptop or other digital implements in at least a decade.</p><p>
    Recordings from that date were released in April on Important as <em>Synth
    Destruction</em>, and now Giffoni has issued the pair's only other performance
    from the tour-- in a trio with Jim O'Rourke-- on his own No Fun label. O'Rourke
    edited and mastered the album's single 52-minute track, a relentless,
    exhaustive journey through nearly every synth noise imaginable.</p><p>
    Whirring static, spurting effects, heavy drones: everything you'd expect
    from three prolific noisemakers is here, all doled out in big, dense brush
    strokes. Yet <em>Electric Dress</em> is no oppressive onslaught. Each participant
    is careful to share and trade sonic space with the other, and what could have
    been claustrophobic or suffocating is instead a balanced improvisation, akin to
    a thoughtful free jazz session.
    </p>
<p>
    Most interesting is how no one here shies away from any kind of sound. Even
    the most standard synth noodlings and laser-like squiggles are given equal
    chance to make a dent. Any noise aficionado has heard all these sounds before,
    but the way the trio times them, massaging them to fit inside the mix's
    ever-changing shape, breathes new life into well-worn sonic tools.
    </p>
<p>
    Not that <em>Electric Dress</em> will win over many skeptics. The album is
    actually relatively easy to enter, opening with 20 minutes of varied sounds
    that form mini-patterns, even getting rhythmic at times. But once the noises
    pile up, things ascend into a challenging assault that rarely recedes. From
    there, a diverse collection of sonic parts add up to a monolithic sum-- the
    kind only noise obsessives are likely to sift through.
    </p>
<p>
    But for such diehards, <em>Electric Dress</em> is a ton of fun to get lost in,
    living up to any expectations these three daunting names might inspire. Merzbow
    was back in the States just recently to play Giffoni's No Fun Fest, but the
    creative success of this record demands that Giffoni return the favor, and get
    back into Akita and O'Rouke's sonic territory as soon as possible.

    It's a bit perplexing when a blog-- especially one as historically minded as Oliver Wang's encyclopedic Soul Sides-- releases a compilation CD, much less an ongoing series. For one thing, there's the financial aspect: several of these tracks have ostensibly been available for free download at some time or another. Why buy the cow and so on? More crucially, there's the technological aspect: Mp3 blogs offer a product that is supposed to make compact discs obsolete. So why bother retrofitting your merchandise to increasingly irrelevant technology, especially when sales of music in corporeal form are tanking?</p><p>
    While I can't speak for Wang or anyone at Zealous Records, there are two possible reasons for setting up this series on disc. First, the audience for decades-old soul music (aside from music critics of course) may tend to skew much older than visitors to sites like Stereogum or Said the Gramophone, attracting an audience that's still grumbling about the quality loss from vinyl to CD-- and don't get them started on CD to digital. So this is a means of branding Wang's site to a larger audience that might not look to the internet as a first source for music.</p><p>
    Second, the music nearly demands the medium. Apart from a few notable exceptions like Isaac Hayes' <em>Hot Buttered Soul</em> or Marvin Gaye's <em>What's Going on</em>, soul favors emotion conveyed in quick bursts rather than drawn out across an album, which has made the music easily compilable under endless themes-- artists, labels, songwriters, eras, cities, even subject matter. From <em>Memphis Soul Classics </em>to the Numero Group's Eccentric Soul project to the latest Trikont musical essay, the compilation may be the most effective delivery system for the music and the most useful summation of its development. Releasing CD-based compilations is a means for Wang not only to collect and comment on that history, but also to participate in it.
    </p>
<p>
    Just two volumes into its hopefully lengthy run, Soul Sides speaks to the depth and breadth of Wang's collection, mixing the new and the old, the obscure and, well, the slightly less obscure. These two discs cover decades, tracing the music from its roots to its current manifestations while offering an admirably inclusive definition of soul. Following the themeless but solid <em>Volume 1</em>, <em>Volume 2</em> is billed as a covers compilation, which is perhaps inevitable considering that the best tracks on <em>Volume 1</em> were Donny Hathaway's better-than-the-original take on John Lennon's ""Jealous Guy"" and Erma Franklin's ""Piece of My Heart"". Avoiding obvious choices and easy novelties, Wang unearths some gems: <em>Volume 2</em> kicks off with Sharon Cash's enormous and immediate ""Fever"", with its immense horns and her immenser vocals. Al Green doesn't change very much on the Beatles' ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", but his ecstatic delivery completely reinvents the tune. Following the organ-drenched uptempo jam of Spanky Wilson's ""Kissing My Love"", O.V. Wright's performance on his grave cover of Latimore's ""Let's Straighten It Out"" strikes a fine balance between despair over a lover's sadness and hope that they can resolve it, giving his pleading a sense of firm authority.
    </p>
<p>
    Wang's choice of songs is nearly impeccable, but his presentation seems problematic. <em>Volume 2</em> moves via unintentionally jarring transitions and awkward juxtapositions. For example, Green's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" sets up Esther Phillips' coolly bitter ""Home Is Where the Hatred Is"", which is then followed by Marcia Griffiths' slinky ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"". It's a strange sequence that detracts from Phillips' real-life hopelessness and makes the physicality of Green's and Griffiths' songs sound frivolous. 
    </p>
<p>
    Wang backloads <em>Volume 2</em> with single-play curios like El Michels Affair's nearly note-for-note re-creation of Isaac Hayes' ""Walk on By"" (itself a cover of a Burt Bacharach tune) and Laura Lee's sluggish ""What a Man"", which has none of the robust spirit of Linda Lyndell's original. These might have sounded stronger peppered throughout the album, but together, they weigh down the comp's second half. It might seem nitpicky to point out sequencing missteps like these, but any good compilation-- and especially a soul compilation-- should be able to generate a larger groove, with each track building on the previous to create a fluid arc from start to finish. The tracklist for <em>Volume 2</em> actively detracts and distracts from each song's impact and meaning, which makes the whole sound disjointed. But that's what playlists are for.

I first caught the Louisville group in the early 1990s while ""working"" as a college radio DJ. I didn't care much for chuckles in my music, but Ethan Buckler's Calvin Johnson-meets-Fred Schneider monotone on <em>Old Man on the Bridge</em> struck me as wonderfully weird. Fifteen or so years after that Homestead debut? Well, big ups for stamina.</p><p>
    Back then, something I'd zeroed in on and relished was that Buckler had been Slint's original late-80s bassist (he'd departed after recording <em>Tweez</em>). I was obsessed with everything Slint, so around the same time, in 1993, I was also keen on that fact that another Drag City act, Will Oldham, had taken the cover photo for <em>Spiderland</em>, but put out a collection of creaky, melancholic mountain music, <em>There Is No-One What Will Take Care Of You</em>.</p><p>
    Seems insane now, but there were legitimate ""late-night debates"" about authenticity, whether or not Oldham was shitting us with a sort of yokel punch line (one dude getting teary to ""I Tried To Stay Healthy For You""). Of course, turns out Oldham wasn't fucking with us. I mention this because in his transition from Slint bassist to B-52-style chanty ringleader, Buckler wasn't fucking with us either-- though his honesty is <em>much</em> less satisfying than Oldham's. What sounded fresh and unhinged in 1992 comes off here as pretty darn stale.
    </p><p>
<em>Buncha Beans</em> is a return to King Kong's traditional sound following 2002's <em>The Big Bang</em>, which found the band incorporating more electro accents.  The band's albums usually center on a specific theme; this one has an arc of animal stories involving cockroaches, monkeys, a ""funky mule"" (uh-oh), elephants, hippos, zebras, kangaroos, and, among others, a ""bald-headed"" eagle and pack of caribous watching steamrollers, bulldozers, and billions of people. Yeah, it's a critique of modern society, of us.  
    </p>
<p>
    Silly as the songs are and as half-baked as the critique comes off, King Kong often finds pretty fun grooves, like the up-beat, surfer-moseying ""Bulldozers"" or the disco high-hat swiveling ""Bug Make"". The storyline of the latter? You smash a bug, wonder ""what difference does a bug make?"" Cue the war/modernization theme and Kafka. Being ""tough in the city"" (or universe) comes up again on ""Tough Guys"", where Buckler's joined by a female vocalist for a sorta rising last-dance/prom-theme/Banana Splits/slow-mo Shaft anthem. Really. He ends the song-- over six minutes later-- with a spoken list of toughs, including my favorite, ""Sloped Forehead Ted."" What ties 'em together? Well, they know that ""cigarettes are not enough"" and ""they're all dead."" Yikes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    A pattern's developed over time and the album's title track follows a standard King Kong method of introducing a simple theme, maxim, or well-worn cliché, and then tweaking it with a play on words or subversive inversion. In this case, a bunch of beans come in various colors with different, shapes, dispositions, and fates. Some watch porno. Many create alienating societies. He doesn't mention it, but I'm guessing some even write record reviews for Pitchfork. Eventually, pulling a Walt Whitman, Buckler hits us with ""I'm a can of beans.""  As with most of the record, this a-ha's cute, but doesn't add up to a hill of...  <br/>

Given the hilariously horrified reaction that many in the dance music community have when confronted with the music of French duo Justice, you'd think they were two 300-pound rampaging Huns who sacked Berlin's Panorama Bar and made off with Ricardo Villalobos and Ellen Allien over their shoulders. Instead, Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay-- high school kids when Daft Punk's <em>Homework</em> dropped over a decade ago-- grew up, like many a young Parisian, filtering hard rock (never a French strong suit) through disco until it sounded more Judas Priest circa 1983 than Stardust circa 1998. Their ""new French touch,"" as the genre's being termed, actually feels like the caress of a sledgehammer.</p><p>
    Throughout <em>†</em>, Justice's long-awaited debut album, Augé and de Rosnay genuflect again and again in front of the Stations of French Dance Music: The metallic ripples of Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo's Crydamoure label, which once sizzled your ear hairs; Thomas Bangalter's Roulé imprint, and its champagne kisses and Chaka Khan dreams; the coke-mirror reflections of idealized 80s keyboards in Alan Braxe and Fred Falke's work; the tongue-lolling hip-hop buffoonery of TTC; Mr. Oizo's spritzing-sphincter bass and convulsing keyboards; and Jackson's OCD vocal edits. Listen to the Cassius-esque disco-twang of ""Genesis"" and tell me these guys are somehow dance-ignorant. But like two naughty schoolboys, they've got their fingers crossed behind their backs the whole time; one thing the duo is not is reverent.</p><p>
    Justice takes this history of the French rave era and blows it out by embracing 21st-century stadium-rock production. They squeeze everything into a mid-range frequency band so loud that the riffs on tracks like ""Let There Be Light"" and ""Stress"" practically cock-slap you in the face. (""Stress"" in particular sounds like a disco-era string arranger came to an in-house orchestra with the injunction ""make it sound like Emergency Broadcast System."") The drums on ""Let There Be Light"" and their big breakthrough single ""Waters of Nazareth"" are the rat-a-tat rhythms of electro scraping like Freddie <span class=""postbody"">Krueger</span>'s fingertips along the slimy walls of some basement dungeon. That's it-- engorged electronic riffs, dizzying astringent strings, vocal samples torqued to all hell, and nasty metallic drums. It's astoundingly unsubtle stuff and bracing as fuck, a decade's worth of French electronic music stripped down like a Peugeot parked overnight in a bad neighborhood.
    </p><p>
    Of course, if that's all <em>†</em> was, it would be unbearable for a full hour, and Justice's critics might have half a point. But the album's more varied than most folks will give it credit for. (Unfortunately, that variety also includes ""The Party"", featuring Ed Banger's abhorrent in-house female rapper Uffie.) ""D.A.N.C.E.""-- the album's slightly incongruous, <em>Schoolhouse Rock</em>-esque filter-disco track-- is Justice's only obvious stab at a capital-p pop crossover hit and you'll certainly be humming ""Do the D-A-N-C-E, 1-2-3-4-5"" whether you want to or not after hearing it. But like <em>Homework</em>, <em>†</em> is a harsh and mostly instrumental set that nonetheless plays like the ideal crossover electronic-pop record. Justice knows how to sequence a dance album to avoid drag and boredom, a skill more suited to hook-friendly architects than a putative demolition crew. The wistful instrumental vignette ""Valentine"", coming after the one-two slap of ""Phantom Pt. 1"" and ""Phantom Pt. 2"", is like a sour, <span class=""postbody"">palate-cleansing</span> appetizer between fat-rich courses in big ol' French meal.
    </p>
<p>
    But well-sequenced or not, <em>†</em> is also a sensation-for-sensation's-sake record, something French house has always excelled out-- even when it's been more classy than crass. Cheekily disregarding so many things that good dance music is ""supposed"" to have-- especially, you know, <em>bass</em>-- and in a post-microhouse era where ""quality sound design"" is a fetishistic obsession, Justice's digital distortion, 128kb-grade hyper-compression, and sometimes aggressively un-funky house sprays good taste with its pissed-up, pissed-off 3 a.m. musk. They've somehow managed to split dance music into a brother-against-brother battle, turning message boards into minefields and blog posts into mini-manifestos. There's no mystery to Justice tracks, true. But whether it's deep house revelers out of their heads on jacked-up gospel or folks in German basements getting down to their own form of minimalized riffing, club rats all over the world are just trying to have a good time. Even if Justice is more about throwing devil horns than doing the hustle, well, we're all still in the same gang.

    Beginning this past March, Los Angeles duo No Age released five impeccably decorated, vinyl-only EPs on five different labels. The blitz coincided with a seemingly endless string of live shows-- the kinds you go home and tell friends about. Not a bad one-two punch. Shattering eardrums in clubs is the most natural way to spread the word about your band, and their records were a smart way to spread a wealth of material while creating colorful collector's items in the process.<em> Weirdo Rippers,</em> an 11-song compilation consisting of highlights from those records, stitches songs together by sound and feel, rather than presenting them chronologically. The songs flow together swimmingly, and despite track-by-track brevity (three songs are under two minutes, three are under three) the group has mastered  a low-tech immensity, and the album builds into something much bigger than its constituent parts.</p><p>
    Guitarist Randy Randall and singing drummer Dean Spunt nabbed ""No Age"" from the 1987 SST compilation of the same name. The album featured Black Flag, Blind Idiot God, Henry Kaiser, Pell Mell, and others taking a stab at instrumental music-- not a bad historical, aesthetic, or West-Coast linkage. The band's coolly detached, eye-catching design schemes aren't random, either: Randall and Spunt, who were two-thirds of beloved noise-rockers Wives, are firmly entrenched in the L.A. DIY/art scene. They collaborate on visual/performance/video art and are connected to grassroots art space the Smell-- the building on the cover of <em>Weirdo Rippers</em>-- where you can score vegan pancakes, drink orange juice, and get a $5 haircut while watching Silver Daggers bleed the speakers. No Age played their first show there in April. <em> </em>(Continuing with the multi-trasking, Spunt also runs PPM! records, which has put out music by Wives, Mika Miko, KIT, Shoplifting, and John Wiese.)</p><p>
    A loud duo with art credibility, a massive touring schedule, and a one-man label in its ranks brings Lightning Bolt to mind; but No Age have a softer surf-psychedelic side that conjures another twosome: old Olympia favorites Kicking Giant. Or, as another Pitchfork staffer pointed out, the best K Records fuzz-rock band of all time, Lync. No Age, though, goes into an even airier, bedroom-pretty realm, with a punk rawness to their delivery. Their oft-chanted hooks (see ""Boy Void"" or ""Every Artist Needs A Tragedy"") are out-of-phase, the approach sloppy and spastic. At the same time, these songs come off soporific, restful, and totally in control. Nothing grates. It all feels soft and up-close. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""I Wanna Sleep"", maybe a mellow response to Harry Pussy's ""I Don't Care About Sleep Anymore"", is a feedback lullaby beneath mellow, chugging guitars. A similar rhythm opens ""My Life's Alright Without You"", which jump-cuts suburban goth to the Dickies' nasal  enunciations (""Well, I hate you/ I hate you/ My life's alright without you""), only after a shuffling loop. Every now and again the drums and vocal kick disappear, revealing that trippiness, which never quite goes away. ""Everybody's Down"" (full disclosure: I included it on a CD I recently curated) is the most rousing, kick-ass song I've heard in a while. Opening with brief spate of backwards distortion strands, it shifts to a speedy strum and doubled vocals shouting teen-bleak lyrics that culminate with a poppy shout of angstful communalism: ""Everybody's down/ Every soul in every town/ Everybody's got me going 'oooh ahhh ooh ahh ooh ahh ooh'."" A speedier shout and dust-kicking drum'n'guitar wrap it up with a clatter. 
    </p>
<p>
    Deerhunter's Bradford Cox <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/40381-guest-list-deerhunter""><strong>recently called No Age his favorite new band</strong></a>. Like Cox's crew, Randall and Spunt seem to be creating their own universe. In ""Loosen This Job"", after drum sticks tap out a code and distortion gently floods the room, Spunt asks, ""Why are there so many records in my life?"" Or at least it sounds like that. It's hard to tell. Whether or not that's what he says,  or what he means, he's right. Despite an overload of music these days, if often feels like there are fewer essential listens. At the end of <em>Weirdo Rippers</em>, you're left with a rare sense of having discovered something new.  Outside just their sound, No Age bring back the DIY energy of Kicking Giant and Lync and '90s zines and, importantly, a life away from computer screens.  The songs have thumping heartbeats. Each and every one. All the jangling feedback loops and cymbal submersions in the world can't hide that.

It can't help but feel symbolic when the Ladybug Transistor covers Trader Horne's ""Here Comes the Rain"", if only because the chorus is awfully similar to Jan &amp; Dean's ""Like a Summer Rain""-- a song this band covered a few albums back. Only a pop geek would spend much time noticing that the next track is vaguely in the style of Twinkle's 1964 hit ""Terry"", except that said next track is titled...""Terry"". And you'd never think that the album's second-best track, ""For No Other"", feels a bit like a song called ""Rushes of Pure Spring""-- not unless you'd heard that one on the Ladybug Transistor's second album. Oh, I'm vastly overstating the case: These are dim resemblances, not steals, and the ""Here Comes the Rain"" thing is surely intentional. But they do seem to reinforce the sense of a band that's still sorting out where to head next, not yet nailing it down.</p><p>
    They can be forgiven for that, especially after the departure of key member Sasha Bell. This is a figuring-things-out album, just as the vast Ladybug &amp; Friends roster of guest contributions suggests: Even the label's advertising copy calls it ""a promise of good things to come."" The good news is that they'd seem to have their eyes on a new path. A few years after 1999's fantastic <em>The Albemarle Sound</em>, the group's high point of paisley-covered indie pop baroque, they took a few steps back toward rock's middle ground, as if worried that all those stately arrangements and flute breaks were going out of style; it's made them more popular, but less interesting. On this record, they make some firm, decisive gestures toward a new direction: Their usual lush, languorous sound picks up tinges of well-heeled folk and country, and a few big doses of the warm, sentimental Nashville sound Lambchop used to trade in.</p><p>
    Bobby Goldsboro gets offered as one potential inspiration, and a listen to his 1968 hit ""Honey""-- lavished with strings, choir, and even theremin-- will explain the connection: Just compare with ""Lord, Don't Pass Me By"", the Ladybug Transistor's grand album closer. (Elsewhere, ""This Old Chase"" sounds, weirdly enough, like Ric Ocasek and the Cars going western.) This sound isn't in the least a bad fit: Singer Gary Olson is one of far too few guys in indie with the kind of rich, liquid baritone that can sell a slow, sad melody. That comes in handy through the rest of this record, too, which feels like a late-breaking, friends-and-all lap through the good old gorgeous: ""For No Other"" in particular is as deep and warm as anything they've ever done. When all those qualities come together with a solid song-- like the beautifully written ""Always on the Telephone""-- it's a real thrill, even before the astounding 80s-styled sax solo.</p><p>
    When it comes to staking out a new direction, these are solid results: You can't help but wish them lots of luck in pinning down their new sound, lineup, and working method, especially after the recent death of San Fadyl, one of the more lovable drummers in indie rock. As an album, though, this one feels like a bit of a stall-- a little filler, a little room to breathe, and a little time to make plans. The band's years making friends and fans all through the indie and indie pop worlds mean they've earned enough credit for people to bear with them, and even enjoy their work in progress-- but here's hoping they'll plow their new furrow as fully, uniquely, and single-mindedly as they did with <em>The Albemarle Sound</em>. <br/></p></div>"|10304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10304-cant-wait-another-day/|6.4|Nitsuh Abebe

<em>Ongiara</em> is named for the vessel the Great Lake Swimmers took to reach their initial recording studio on Toronto Island. But the real gem in this band's acoustics goes deservedly to Aeolian Hall in London, Ontario, where Vieux Farka Touré and dozens of others have performed, and where most of this album was recorded. The effect is, naturally, that of a live performance, which lends some color and depth to an otherwise bland, somnambulant group of songs.</p><p>
    Some of the contributions from several seasoned collectivists and soloists, including Owen Pallett's string arrangements, add washes of pleasure-- among them, Mike Bonnell's friendly-sounding organ at the edges of ""Backstage with the Modern Dancers"", or the trickling electric guitar on ""Changing Colours"". But others-- such as the lead banjo on opener ""Your Rocky Spine""-- are ultimately immediately disappointing and distracting. The perpetually slow pace isn't always necessary, either, and ploddingly cliché lyrics like, ""Where the wind takes you/ It takes me too/ When you change colors/ I change colors too"" add to the dearth of faux-folk motifs. Still, ""Colours"" has the pleasant ring of Mazzy Star: The subtle, lilting melody and assumedly natural reverbs are perfectly at home with the grunge aperitifs of the 90s.</p><p>
    Like many a competent folk singer, Tony Dekker has a full, warm voice that's perfectly suited to the recording atmosphere and the acoustic guitar, but it would be more enjoyable to see Dekker's vocals paired up with Lewis &amp; Clarke's complex, energetic string arrangements. If there are half a dozen additional instrumentalists on this album, most of the time you can't tell, whereas Lewis &amp; Clarke's small number still manages to sound like a controlled experiment in one guitar's response to nature, and each other instrument's response to <em>it</em>. ""Put There By the Land"" has the body and weight-- with just a few thick bass plucks early on and string pizzicato later-- to provide the shy vivacity the first half of the album could have used, and periodic electric guitar strums show us just the faintest glimmer of rock. ""Land"" also harkens back to sea shanties with pretty repetition from the violin, rather than being feather-light or overly ruminative.</p><p>
    Lovers (and players) of the guitar see intricacy in even its most subtle melodic inventions, and the beginning of ""Where in the World Are You"" shows potential. The lyrical narrative is also stronger, and benefits from surprising yet simple rhymes: ""I looked for you up in the tallest of trees/ Swayed back and forth in the mid-autumn breeze/ When the leaves reddened and left too/ I knew then that it wasn't you."" Still, what detracts from this album is just how light it is: It doesn't need anger, darkness, or mania to prop it up, but it does need variety and vivacity, something only tempo changes and more frequent sprinklings of different tones and bolder instrumentation could accomplish. </p></div>"|10300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10300-ongiara/|5.5|Liz Colville

    The cover photograph of <em>The Dark One</em>, the first record since 2001
    from Alsace Lorraine, seems designed to represent a symbolic break with the
    past from the band's previous (and only other) album, <em>Through Small Windows</em>.
    <em>Dark</em>'s picture shows a window, but from the outside of a building in
    disrepair, ready for renovation. The group itself has gone through a
    significant overhaul over the past six years-- the hiatus caused by core member
    Paul Francke's recovery from health problems and entrance into an Episcopalian
    seminary-- and <em>Dark</em> features a new vocalist, Isol, the former singer for
    Argentinean electro-pop group Entre Rios. Isol is also an illustrator of books
    for what she calls ""smart children"", and her lyrics-- highbrow
    narratives presented through a thick veneer of youthful wonder-- merge with
    Francke's hazy, weightless backdrops and wry introspection to create an muted,
    effervescent collection of ivory-tower indie pop.</p><p>
<em>Dark</em>'s clear highlight is ""Call for Papers"", which
    favorably compares to predecessors who've also highlighted the ""twee""
    in ""tweed"": the Magnetic Fields, Belle &amp; Sebastian, and especially
    Camera Obscura, whose wonderfully glum academic rebuke from last year,
    ""Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken"", feels like its companion piece.
    Taking a subject line of so many inter-collegiate e-mails seeking intellectual
    collaboration and re-imagining it as a plea for improved interpersonal
    communication might seem a recipe for disaster of the ponytail/elbow-patch
    variety, but ""Paper""'s duet is heartfelt and, in its own way, sweet.
    Isol responds to Francke's romantic plea (""How many times have I cut your
    hair?"") by lamenting her silence as a ""writer's block,"" arising
    as it does from a too-quantitative approach to love: ""weighing facts,
    cataloguing dreams.""</p><p>
    ""Papers"" comes during the middle of <em>Dark</em>'s first half,
    surrounded by likeminded songs that highlight the band's knack for wispy
    melodies, opaque literary pretensions, and, occasionally, bizarre yet still
    appropriate-sounding phrases. The chiming, xylophone-laden ""As We
    Fight"" mines the same Spectorian territory as the Pipettes, while featuring
    the lines ""Homeskillet, does she calm your Dad?"" and ""There is a
    way that clinically sad students in love talk, my darling."" ""Dulce et Decorum"" is a Cocteau Twins song masquerading as a Basil King
    motivational tract (""Vigilant bulrushes kneel before you, surround and
    guard you""), and ""One Day, Far Off, If the World Forgot""
    imagines a future where ""the world forgot all about rock"" and
    ""if in our teenage years, nothing changed."" It's not a sad song
    either, just cautiously speculative, from the same emotional distance the rest
    of <em>Dark</em> employs to good effect.
    </p>
<p>
    Like good intellectuals, Francke and Isol know in which tradition they're
    situated: Saint Etienne's Ian Catt and the Cocteau Twins' Robin Guthrie show up
    to remix ""Papers"" and ""The Tall Grass"", respectively.
    Unfortunately, Guthrie feels the need to create a stereotypically Cocteau-esque
    icy whirr, thereby sapping the original of its airy appeal, and Catt's version
    enriches ""Paper""'s sonics, adds a zither and melodica, but not much
    else. This is fine, though; Catt's and Guthrie's underwhelming remixes only
    prove that Alsace Lorraine don't need tacked-on cameos to flesh out or draw
    attention to their record; their original work does well enough on their own.

    It may seem cheap to bring
    up the departure of Nick Oliveri three years and two albums after he
    was fired from Queens of the Stone Age, but the more I listen to
    <em>Era Vulgaris</em>, the more I think his presence
    is sorely missed.  I'm not advocating the guy's return, but the tradeoff between Josh
    Homme's reserved cool and Olivieri's crazy-go-nuts screaming was one
    of the group's strengths in their heyday; years later, someone for Homme to play off would still be a welcome addition to the band.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    Queens of the Stone Age has been mostly Homme's show ever since, and it's been a mixed bag so far.  <em>Lullabies
    to Paralyze</em> was quality, a chance for QOTSA
    v2.0 to retrench and carve out their own niche, even if those who were less enamored
    with the album's glowering charms, saw that niche as
    a rut-- an example of what Oliveri's loss actually meant to the
    group.  If <em>Era Vulgaris</em> is any indication, the
    group felt the same way: This album tries its best to be
    everything all at once (often within one track), and in
    attempting to cover too much ground, the band loses focus and direction.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    It's not so much that the songs themselves are weak, just that many of the choices made in them are. For
    instance, ""Sick, Sick, Sick"" would be better off simply sticking with Homme's
    motor-mouthed singing and riffing; instead, the song bellyflops into a flat chorus where everyone sings
    like they're scared of their own voices.  (Since the Strokes' Julian Casablancas
    guests on this song, let's blame him. Why not?) Elsewhere, Homme
    spreads his falsetto all over ""Misfit Love"", where it'd be more effective in shorter bursts, while the obnoxious bridge on album closer ""Run Pig Run"" (it pops up <em>twice!</em>) kills any chance it might've had for worthy inclusion on a future edition of <em>Guitar Hero</em>. (Note to Activision: I am totally cool with requisite QOTSA singles
    ""No One Knows"" or ""3's and 7's"" bringing the rock fury and
    carpal tunnel.)
    </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
    The most enjoyable moments on <em>Era Vulgaris</em> come when the band treads off the beaten path. One of the album's standout tracks, ""Make It Wit Chu"",
    is a straight-forward blues-rock number plucked from the last <em>Desert
    Sessions</em> disc.  And the album's gentler digressions, like the
    guitar-weeping ""Into the Hollow"" and the mournful ""Suture Up
    Your Future"", reveal Homme has a surprisingly palatable softer side.   ""Turning on the Screw""
    and ""I'm Designer"" aren't exactly groundbreaking departures from the QOTSA's usual fare, but Homme's lyrical bent adds an interesting wrinkle. 
    No one's going to confuse him with Bob Dylan any time this century,
    but you could put much worse in your mouth than lines like, ""My
    generation's for sale/ Beats a steady job/ How much have you got?""
    or, ""You can't lose it if you never had it/ Disappear man, do some
    magic."" It's at points like these when <em>Era
    Vulgaris</em> truly comes to life.  Unfortunately for listeners, those
    moments are few and far between, leaving fans to trudge back to older Queens records for the fix they crave.

Hell, even his block party of a debut, 2003's star-studded <em>Here Comes the Fuzz</em>, had its share of interesting musical ideas. However, it's hard to look at <em>Version</em>--  a guest artist-boosted showcase that comes on the heels of Ronson's production work for Lily Allen and Amy Winehouse-- as anything but a cash-grab. Not that cover albums can't be eclectic, but there's little-to-no coherence between the songs chosen here except for the fact that the artists who wrote them are UK chart mainstays.</p><p>
    While song selection seems suspect on <em>Version</em>, it's not the deal-breaker. Ronson is a phenomenal multi-instrumentalist, but someone's gotta cut him off at a certain number of horn and string sections. For example, hearing a moody, standoffish anthem like the Smiths' ""Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before"" (its presence here a cheeky nod to critics who'd call this entire album superfluous) get dusted off and given the <em>Pygmalion</em> treatment smacks of indie blasphemy, the canned strings and Daniel Merriweather's schmaltzy croon clumsily converting Morrissey into a blaxploitation theme.</p><p>
    To Ronson's credit, what should be the most egregious track on the album, a cover of Radiohead's ""Just"", is actually a standout. Nicked from last year's abysmal Radiohead tribute album <em>Exit Music: Songs With Radio Heads</em> [<u><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/21232-exit-music-songs-with-radio-heads"">review</a></u>], the track finds Phantom Planet's Alex Greenwald adding a playful dose of white-boy funk, and is one of the few instances where Ronson's hip-hop proclivities come in handy. Still, slapping a brand new bag on these pasty-white-dude tunes more often bombs than not. Maxïmo Park's ""Apply Some Pressure""-- re-interpreted here with help from MP singer Paul Smith-- loses its jagged post-punk edge amidst the lush horns and thin symphonic outro, and the Zutons' ""Valerie"" gets mauled by Amy Winehouse, bent and twisted until it sounds like a spare part of ""Rehab"".</p><p>
    What this all boils down to is that Ronson probably would've been better off remixing these songs than dolling them up with droves of big-name mercenaries and genre-fucking. Most of <em>Version</em>'s tracks have little replay value, shaking your attention before you can say, ""So that's what 'God Put a Smile Upon Your Face' would sound like played by a high school marching band."" And of course, a handful of the originals just weren't that great to begin with. Maybe I'm giving Ronson more credit than he deserves, but the guy's too talented to smash square pegs into readymade round holes and abet the ongoing implosion of pop music as we know it.</p></div>"|10299.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10299-version/|3.3|Adam Moerder

<em>Soft Punk </em>is
    the first full-length album released by California harsh noise and parasympathetic
    drone aesthete John Wiese<em> </em>on New
    Jersey's Troubleman Unlimited, an eager imprint that's been treading the
    turbulent waters between sonic abstraction and punk aggression for a decade.
    Through TMU's small-batch/good-records approach, bands like Growing and Double
    Leopards share shelves with Meneguar and Panthers (not to mention Glass Candy,
    Tussle and The Walkmen), meeting somewhere near the fuck-all eruptions of Wolf
    Eyes and now in the careful and meticulous, feverish and intoxicating noise of Wiese.
    Recorded between 2002 and 2005, <em>Soft Punk </em>is
    a zenithal intersection of everything Wiese has done right for the past decade:
    Collagist tendencies meet drone hyper-abilities; assaulting glitches and
    glissandos come buried between near silence and hair-raising volume; beauty is
    refracted through sonic brutality.</p><p>
    The title <em>Soft Punk</em>
    seems to have two functions, then: Like its brilliant cover art by Kaz Oshiro--
    three bright pink Marshall amplifiers that are, <a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/wieseback.gif""><strong>as the back cover shows</strong></a>, simply
    stretched-canvas, three-dimensional paintings of such fantasy gear-- <em>Soft Punk</em> suggests looking and listening
    again, of rethinking that ugly noise/punk divide. Just when you think you have
    a handle on Wiese, he's onto something else. There's always a next level here.
    No, this isn't punk, and it's not soft. But it's not simple sheets of harsh
    noise, either. Wiese's constant push and pull and his eventual acquiescence to
    let things build and burn are capable of rock's epiphany and articulation, even
    if it's ""just a bunch of god damned noise"" in the end.</p><p>
<em>Soft Punk</em> is
    a statement of process, too. Under the name Sissy Spacek-- which he uses for
    both solo work and collaborations-- Wiese manipulates and processes his own
    recordings and spews them back as ultra-damaged, something-like-punk,
    more-like-noise spasms. Here, he's sampling his punk rock friends again,
    stacking those sounds-- crowd cheers, drum rolls, drumstick counts-- on top and
    inside of his own. During ""Snow Pit"", Wiese concentrates on snippets
    from Olympia trio Die Monitor Bats, using a live set's beginnings, ends, and
    screaming innards as heavy construction paper and bright crayons. He drops
    drumstick counts into the mix four times, sprinting in wildly different
    directions after each. It's either ""One, two, three, four, NEAR SILENCE"" or ""One, two, three four, OH SHIT! LOUD!"" Take your
    chances, sucker. 
    </p>
<p>
    Much like Japanese electronic composer Ryoji Ikeda,
    Wiese excels in making clean, precise cuts between drastically different
    sounds, building a drop-dead dynamic capable of stepping from almost-absent
    rumbles and hums to furious noise bursts. This is apparent on ""PS2"",
    where Wiese uses bait-and-switch, build-and-kill mechanics as his chief
    compositional tool. He buries valleys into peaks and somehow finds peaks that are
    higher and more rugged with uncanny persistence. A machine-gun rhythm reverses
    into a glitchy spasm, then settles into a pressurized monotone before ducking
    into near-nothingness. None of these sounds lasts for more than three seconds,
    but such vacillations never seem rushed with Wiese. He's always in control, the
    master of a sonic domain that reaches far-and-wide, high-and-low with
    enthusiasm and magnetism. It's as though he collects a world of sound and spits
    it out piecemeal-- methodically, dramatically, emphatically-- through a
    morphing matrix designed for ricochets. Falling in love with a sliver of sound
    only to be slapped senselessly by something totally unrelated? It's as
    maddening as it is exhilarating. 
    </p>
<p>
    But the proof is in <em>Soft
    Punk</em>'s center: During a three-track, mid-album stretch, Wiese eases
    into a neon pink drone, a beautiful sound that he just won't leave alone. He
    bends and shocks it, reshapes it, piles drums on top of it, overdrives it, and
    eventually altogether destroys it. When the track expires with a blitz of
    malformed waves, Wiese builds a perfect, long-tone aubade reminiscent of Jason
    Lescalleet's work on ""The Pilgrim"". For those who haven't heard it, ""The Pilgrim"" was Lescalleet's gorgeous 74-minute farewell to his deceased father, all gentle tones fanfaring gradually into outer space. For three minutes, Wiese sings a similar sigh, perhaps letting the body of the punk rock he's setting on fire burn away at the midpoint. And then, as he should, Wiese thrusts all of his weight into ""New Wave Dust"", perhaps the album's most chaotic, relentless, damaging track. 
    </p>
<p>
    Power electronics? Oh my. Punk rock? If only.

    Two years ago, summer was in full swing, the sun was shining, and James Toth
    had ten thousand records out. ""It's a fucking epidemic,"" wrote
    Pitchfork reviewer Brandon Stosuy, before giving Wooden Wand's solo outing <em>Harem
    of the Sundrum &amp; the Witness Figg</em> the notice it deserved. Toth had
    departed from his signature improvised collaborations with the Vanishing Voice
    in order to make a minimal, surprisingly spiritual collection of unadorned
    songs. Who knew for sure, before <em>Harem</em>, that beneath all the improv and WWVV's mountain-man affectations the group included at
    least one real songwriter? <em>Harem</em> staggers into the present as one of a
    few survivors of the plague of forgetfulness than has pretty much sent
    ""free-folk"" back to the wispy place from whence it came.</p><p>
    Wooden Wand &amp; the Vanishing Voice tapered off soon enough-- though not
    before releasing the NNCK-jazzed <em>Gipsy Freedom</em> last year-- and according
    to Toth are pretty much done: after <em>James &amp; the Quiet</em>, he's retiring
    the Wooden Wand mantle. <em>James</em> is a close cousin to <em>Harem</em>, featuring
    as it does Toth stripped down. But where <em>Harem</em>, in
    retrospect, benefited from the rush of creativity Toth was surfing-- its lo-fi
    unfinished veneer and Shrimper-style tape-distortion had all the hallmarks of a
    quick in-and-out job-- <em>James &amp; the Quiet</em> is a more deliberate
    animal. Produced in rich fashion by Lee Ranaldo, who also plays on the record, Toth's new record features comparatively elaborate arrangements built around the same basic guitar and vocal template, and not always for the better.</p><p>
    Listen to ""The Pushers"" and hear just how much more he's singing,
    how focused the mix is on his lyrics and voice. This is a bit strange, given
    that his writing tends towards the nonlinear and the oblique-- say, the
    Dylanesque koan of ""mutants and monsters did gather in the
    mausoleum,"" from ""Invisible Children"". A more favorable Dylan
    comparison (well, here's third: Toth's voice can be brutal) might apply to the
    nigh ecstatic ""Spitting at the Cameras"", a slow motion and abstracted
    ""To Ramona"". ""Spitting"" is raspy and melodic and beautiful.
    There, as elsewhere, Jessica Toth helps out with the vocals, and her voice is
    wonderful-- a husky hyper-articulated alto, an even tone skating easily over a
    whisky-soaked vibrato.
    </p>
<p>
<em>James &amp; the Quiet</em> is Toth's attempt at a singular presentation of
    himself as an artist-- ""an un-weird record,"" in his terms, designed
    to be music more synonymous with its creator than the wah-wah pedal wash that
    characterized his output with the Vanishing Voice. Along with ""Spitting"",
    the mid-record pairing of ""We Must Also Love the Thieves"" and
    ""Invisible Children"" arrives at this sort of portrait of the artist
    as back-porch master, playing sing-along songs in all the places you weren't at
    but wished you had been. As he writes in the latter, ""There's nothing in
    the light/ Just invisible children we sing to at night.""
    </p>
<p>
    But a little bit of this stuff goes a long way. The country-cooked
    minimalism of the drawling ""Blood"", the snake-charmer sleaze of
    ""In A Bucket"", the adjective-plagued ""Blessed Damnation"" (e.g.,
    ""The residue of collegiate superstitions will not be removed/ So you take
    your own gristle-caked notions for a walk in a dream"")-- it all starts to
    feel like somebody sticking their tongue into your ear. 
    </p>
<p>
    The fastidiousness of the sound on <em>James</em>, and the heavy emphasis on
    the artist at the other end of the speaker, can be a trap for Toth. In 2005,
    the distant production and spontaneous aesthetic of <em>Harem of the Sundrum
    &amp; the Witness Figg</em> held a lot of this discomfort at bay, even it if it
    cost Toth some notice. Maybe now he's overcompensating?

    Until now, the reputation of Northamptonshire
    home-recorder James Chapman has rested upon a couple of singles, ""Start
    Something"" b/w ""To the Sky"" and ""Lost My Soul"" b/w
    ""Sparks in the Snow"". The singles evoked a simpler version of
    Caribou, with their sorta-hip-hop beats and kinda-psychedelic pop trappings; of
    M83, with their swooping and unapologetically grand keyboards; and perhaps of
    the Postal Service, albeit one cured of the hiccups. But because Chapman
    forewent the use of computers in favor of recording straight to 16-track, the
    singles lacked the imposing stature of these digitally-inclined touchstones.
    For all of its luxuriant majesty, Chapman's music sounds somewhat aloof; the
    tape onto which it was recorded acts as a thin but palpable barrier between the
    music and the listener. This is not an unpleasant quality; in fact, the analog
    warmth of Chapman's compositions is among their most charming aspects.</p><p>
    As if realizing he'd found a winning formula on these
    early releases, Chapman opted to make them over and over again to flesh out his
    debut LP, <em>We Can Create</em>. As a result, the album-- which includes both
    ""To the Sky"" and ""Lost My Soul""-- contains no real duds,
    and almost any song on it would make a fine single. Taken together, however,
    the homogeneity of their construction dilutes their appeal. Track after track
    drops melodic and tonal variations into the same inflexible stencil-- one
    that's invariably linear, with a transparent, bar-by-bar approach to dynamic
    shifts. The drums, in particular, beg for some discrepancy-- virtually the same
    skittering smack pushes along the surging keyboards on each song.</p><p>
    Not that this formula doesn't produce some winners.
    ""So High, So Low"" is a perfect summertime confection, despite being
    the most formulaic song on the album-- it is, in fact, <em>transcendently</em>
    formulaic. Its title aptly summarizes its dynamics-- alternating between a
    lean, fuzzy synth throb and sweeping, overdriven ahs, its bright pastel
    contrasts and unforgettable melody elevate it above its peers. ""You Don't
    Know Her Name"" is almost as good, adhering to the same template in more
    intricate detail, but by ""Elouise"", with its buzzy synth wash and
    straightforward churn, one gets the sinking feeling that all else is
    preordained. The telegraphic urgency of ""It Will Find You"", with its
    trip-hop density and spaghetti-synths, provides a welcome contrast to the album
    proper's exaggerated sway, as does the vanishing and beatless ""Glory
    Verse"". There's a lot to recommend in Chapman's as-the-crow-flies approach
    to songwriting, but one wishes he'd occasionally slow down and take the scenic
    route instead.

    out of permanently defunct outfits-- labels of all sizes continue scrambling for new (and sometimes appalling) ways to 
    re-package, remaster, reissue, re-release, and re-squeeze artist catalogs dry-- and then some. The heartbreaking 
    part is that sometimes all that industry hustle yields devastating results: 
    Last November, Sony released a 19xCD box set of the Clash's 19 U.S.-
    and UK-charted singles from 1977 to 1985, complete with B-sides, promotional 
    bits, accompanying 12"" mixes, and the <em>Capital Radio</em> EP (which 
    was originally given away with copies of the <em>NME</em>, and previously 
    unavailable commercially, although the Clash fan club did reissue the 
    collection in 1977).<br/></p><p>
    With more than 60 tracks (laid 
    onto endearing faux-vinyl compact discs, each with paper liners), 
    the box was a sentimental and aesthetic triumph. But in pragmatic terms, 
    it was also vaguely infuriating: To listen to the entire collection, 
    you'd have to change CDs 19 times, or more likely, waste half 
    an evening loading all the discs onto your computer and constructing 
    your own playlist. Plus, it cost <em>$80</em>. Now, ostensibly on occasion of 
    the band's 30-year anniversary, <em>The Singles</em> box set has been squished 
    onto one reasonably-priced long-playing disc, the 20-track <em>The 
    Singles</em>: Included are all 18 A-sides from the box (no <em>Capital 
    Radio</em>), plus ""Train in Vain"" (the ""secret"" song-- and U.S. hit single-- tucked at the end of 1979's seminal <em>
    London Calling</em>) and ""Groovy Times"", a U.S.-only promo single 
    that was also included on <em>The Cost of Living</em>, a four-song UK 
    EP released in 1979.</p><p>
    The Clash wrote loads of political 
    songs, and Joe Strummer's extracurricular sermonizing only inflated the band's finger-wagging rep. But Clash records were never 
    didactic, cold, or patronizing-- <em>The Singles</em> is high proof 
    that the group (unlike other equally-adept, equally-great political 
    songwriters) were actually a killer party band. 
    Try broadcasting <em>The Singles</em> from top to bottom without sneering, 
    pogo-ing, fist-pumping, spitting, high-kicking, shoulder-popping, disco-shimmying, 
    or punching yourself in the thigh at least once. 
    Try not adding in your own background howls; try not 
    screaming ""Thinks it's not kosher!"" out an open window, collapsing 
    onto the couch, then returning to holler, ""This is a public service 
    announcement… with guitars!"" <br/>
</p><p>
    Clearly, the triumph here is 
    not so much the assembling of these tracks (these file-swapping times mean scoring rare cuts is less a victory than a banality), but the reminder that, after 
    all the mythologizing and eulogizing, the Clash were a band who released 
    a mess of mind-blowing singles. The songs seem to be organized in order 
    of notoriety (starting with ""London Calling"" and ending with ""White 
    Riot""), and unsurprisingly, it's the oft-forgotten middle songs that sound the best right now. 
    </p>
<p>
    1980's ""Bankrobber"" is 
    slathered with tin-can echo, so much so that Mick Jones' backing vocals 
    sound as if they're bring transmitted from space. Fold in a handful 
    of weird bass effects, and it starts to sound like the whole thing was 
    written and realized underwater, in zero gravity. The 
    notion that the song is actually about a kid whose dad robs banks because he doesn't feel like getting a real job suddenly seems irrelevant. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    1978's ""(White Man) In 
    Hammersmith Palais"" is equally surreal-- arguably the Clash's 
    first successful experiment with reggae, and written when Strummer was 
    bummed about staying up all night for a crappy reggae showcase (""Midnight 
    to six man/ For the first time from Jamaica/ Dillinger and Leroy Smart/ 
    Delroy Wilson, you cool operator"") at London's Hammersmith Palais, 
    ""(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais"" manages to indict power-pop, 
    shoddy reggae, and neo-Nazism in one four-minute span. Strummer 
    was openly pissed about the show's Four Tops-style geniality (""but 
    onstage they ain't got no roots-rock rebel""), but ""Palais"" 
    is plenty friendly itself, featuring a classic, singalong pop melody. 
    Likewise, ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""Know Your Rights"", and ""Clash 
    City Rockers"" are all timeless, addictive romps. As intellectual as the Clash may have seemed to some, their songs were
    always more ecstatic than enraged. Ultimately, the Clash endure
    because they inspire.

But what saves the Providence-bred quintet from being a mere exercise in college-radio nostalgia is that the sort of endearingly fidgety indie rock Get Him Eat Him deal in never really went out of fashion-- it just got its shit together and
    decided not let amateurism get in the way of ambition. Even in brief two-minute bursts, <em>Geography Cones</em> displayed no lack of grandeur, combining the sensitive melodicism that was intrinsic to so much 90s bedroom-rock with synth-heavy, progged-out arrangements. On <em>Arms Down</em>, that nervous energy matures into confidence.</p><p>
    The first words frontman Matt LeMay utters on opener ""2x2"" are, ""It's a familiar sound/ We're under attack,"" perhaps a knowing nod to its place in the canon of underachiever fight songs. But for Get Him Eat Him, resignation is best combated with celebration. The enemies ""beating [them] back"" are unidentified, but that's immaterial-- as ""2x2"" illustrates, the best part about going to war is getting to write your own cavalry song, and they've got guest trumpeter Zach Condon on hand to give it the coup de brass. Condon is but one of the special guests (the Wrens' Charles Bissell and occasional Broken Social Scene keyboardist Chris Brown among them) who lend <em>Arms Down</em> an expanse and emotional release that its predecessor sometimes lacked, whether because it had a more modest production budget or its oversaturated synth arrangements verged on schticky. Credit producer Jason Cadell (ex-Dismemberment Plan) for encouraging the band's art-pop fancies without buffing the jagged edges-- for all the horn charts and dense keyboard textures, you never lose the sense that these songs would sound just as good in a drunken, sweaty basement gig on campus.</p><p>
    It's tempting to gauge the influence of LeMay's writing career on his music, but, what the hell, I'll give in: <em>Arms Down</em>'s front-loaded sequence and tightly stuffed, multi-sectional song structures sound like the logical products of someone who's spent many a day sifting through stacks of unknown bands' CDs, plopping them on his stereo, and praying he won't be bored. To that end, Get Him Eat Him waste no time in seizing your attention: ""Diminutive"" manages to shift gears from urgent soul stomper to swooning, string-swept balladry with a remarkable ease worthy of Ted Leo; ""Push and Pull"" is a melancholic power-pop surge that, with the sudden intrusion of some piercing guitar tones, takes a sharp left turn out of the second verse and careens off the rails. Elsewhere, LeMay's GBV jones manifests itself in a pair of beauties: the gleaming, <em>Under the Bushes</em>-style ballad ""The Coronation Show"" and ace <em>Do the Collapse</em>-era rocker ""Leaders in Doubt"".</p><p>
    But as so many indie pop bands have learned, it's an exuberance that's difficult to sustain for the full duration of an album, even one that clocks in under 40 minutes. In its closing stretch, <em>Arms Down</em> settles into a comfort zone of sorts: The unpredictability of the songs' constantly changing structures starts to feel predictable in itself, and the unwavering sensitivity of LeMay's voice has the effect of making post-punky jangle-pop turns like ""CBT"" and ""Get Down!"" sound more uniform than they actually are. If Get Him Eat Him eventually succumb to battle fatigue, the effectiveness of their opening strikes is proof enough that their efforts were not in vain.</p></div>"|10317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10317-arms-down/|7.2|Stuart Berman

Each song set off in numerous directions, leaving the listener with that muddled feeling of flipping through too many channels, opening too many IM windows, or leaving bookmarks in too many books. The eight months between their debut and <em>Split Lips, Winning Hips, a Shiner</em> has given Shapes and Sizes time to streamline their songs, hone in on the best parts of their jumbled structures, and embellish those parts with engaging instrumentation, dynamic vocals, and smart lyrics. The stylistic shifts are still here-- they're just less jarring now-- and on the whole, the band seems to be paying closer attention to songcraft.</p><p>
    From leadoff track ""Alone/Alive"", it's apparent that keyboardist and co-vocalist Caila Thompson-Hannant has improved as a singer: She deftly navigates loud/soft, elated/depressed dynamics, and not just on this song. And while the boasts and hyperbole of their self-titled LP are still present, Thompson-Hannant tempers her shouts with whispers and moans, all of which melds beautifully with the blustery chaos and slight dissonance that colors the opener.</p><p>
    What makes <em>Split Lips</em> rise above similar albums is its ability to inflate small portions of songs into mini-showcases for, say, a few great bars of percussion (""Head Movin'""), gameshow synths (""Geese""), or pubescent cracks, shrieks, and hisses (""Can't Stop That (Sinking) Feeling""). That amplification comes in handy on ""The Taste in My Mouth"": Slower, shorter, and more mournful than most S&amp;S songs, its verses hint at domestic abuse and self-mutilation. Elegiac trumpets and a nervous tick on a single guitar string add to the tension. ""I'll suck my fingers until they're dry and numb/ And all the pain is in the taste in my mouth,"" Thompson-Hannant whispers meticulously, as if she's prepared to catch her words between her lips before they escape.
    </p><p>
    Guitarist and co-vocalist Rory Seydel still plays the straight man to his female counterpart's brashness. However, in ""Can't Stop That (Sinking) Feeling"", he briefly breaks free from his indie rock grumble: During the song's Sea and Cake-esque guitar progression, he repeats ""As I grow old!"" until Thompson-Hannant enters, backing up his anguish. Their frequent vocal interplay, combined with their loss-of-innocence lyrics, could get them mistaken for Rainer Maria. But Shapes and Sizes aren't all heart-on-sleeve declarations; they balance every weighty proclamation with humor, and-- <em>imagine</em>-- actually sound like they're having fun.
    </p>
<p>
    In fact, most songs here travel a range of emotions, but sadly some are sketches that could have been tacked onto other songs or relegated to B-Sides and tour EPs . ""Grassy Corner, a Sunset"" and ""Canvas Skies, Muslin Trees"", both ramblers, share so much but add up to so little. These missteps pass quickly, though. For the most part, Split Lips is a statement of newfound confidence that finds Shapes and Sizes growing without sacrificing their infectious, guileless innocence. Each repeat listen reveals new tunnels through the band's complex of melody and sound, and each turn feels new and untrodden.

Singer and songwriter Craig Klein took that misfortune as an opportunity to redouble his songwriting efforts, however, augmenting them with the sort of historical research made possible by his day job at the Chicago Public Library.  A couple of years later, he emerges with <em>Ice Station</em>, a concept album about an imagined trip from Siberia to China and back again.</p><p>
    Like any travelogue worth undertaking, <em>Ice Station</em> concerns itself not as much with the destination as the process of reaching it, and each song is a keenly crafted and ingratiating set piece documenting an imagined journey.  Much of the record's crystalline desolation is no doubt due to Klein's collaborator Joshua Eustis, previously known for his sharp, electronic dissonance with Telefon Tel Aviv.  Here, the guitars purr robotically, the drums are as flat and unforgiving as the white tundra, and Klein's voice resonates like a warm radio signal.  Echoes of dark, pliable post-punk bass appear frequently, as does the lonesome electro-gloom of Casiotone for the Painfully Alone and the understated eccentricity of early Pinback, but Klein's work here is set apart by its clean, simple approach to moody expressionism.</p><p>
    The record abounds with the sort of spaciousness and clarity that come from an all-too-rare effective translation of environment to music, and its vague narrative of adventure and romance is impressively heightened with a keen ear toward the forcefulness of big, dramatic moments.  ""The Shortest Way to China"" opens with a guitar tightly wound into a thin screech, before giving way to a towering chorus.  ""Ice Station"" complements its bassline, which rumbles like an icebreaker engine, with clipped puffs of breath and the spectral repetition of ""Ulan Bator"", the Mongolian capital that doubles as a steady vamp. ""Odessa"" is a cantering road fable about a journey to the titular city, and Klein's weary, melismatic vocals on ""A Kind of Solution"" feel like an exhausted plea to a long-lost lover.</p><p>
    Throughout <em>Ice Station</em>, the sense of cinema is palpable; Klein and Eustis' music seems designed to aurally evoke elements David Lean's panaoramic stoicism, the glimmering dystopia of Blade Runner, and Robert Flaherty's lonesome minutae.  If the record has a fault, it's that its last quarter relaxes a bit too much, gliding to a gradual conclusion instead of going out with a bang.  But it's a minor quibble-its best quality is Klein's ability to make restraint sound fresh and vibrant, and it offers evidence that his own isolation, digging through stacks of dusty reference books, helped immeasurably to create <em>Ice Station</em>'s ingratiating sense of frozen solitude.</p></div>"|10285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10285-ice-station/|7.5|Eric Harvey

    simmering late 1970s punk scene. They were also one of the first to come to the
    conclusion that punk<span> </span>just wasn't
    enough.<span> </span>Following 1977's monster
    ""(I'm) Stranded"", the Saints branched out with ""Eternally Yours"", soon going
    even further afield with ""Prehistoric Sounds"". Casual fans checked out, and
    soon so did co-leader Ed Kuepper, leaving partner Chris Bailey to carry on with
    the Saints name.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The recent reunion of fellow Aussie pioneers Radio Birdman
    has somewhat overshadowed the continued output of the Saints, which aside from
    the very rare reunion with his old bandmates remains Bailey and whomever he
    calls his bandmates. As recently as 2005 that included Martin Wilson-Piper of
    the Church, but with <em>Imperious Delirium</em> the Saints are down to a trio.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Still, Bailey is at the helm, and he plays all the guitars,
    so it's a Saints record. Close enough, right? It's to both the band's credit
    and detriment that <em>Imperious Delirium</em> could have been released at nearly any
    time in the last 30 years by nearly any neo-punk guitar band from that span. Of
    course, the Saints aren't just any band, and this is 2007, not 1977. So how
    much of the Saints legacy should be taken into account when assessing the record?
    </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    On its face, <em>Imperious Delirium</em> sounds like a promising,
    above-average demo, muddy sound and all. It's more than listenable if totally
    unexceptional stuff. But if it weren't by the Saints, would we be listening at
    all? And if it had come from the Saints circa '77, would be still be listening
    to it today?
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Probably not. If anything, the album hearkens back to the
    days just before punk, when garage and pub rock ruled the underground and bands
    like the Stooges, MC5 and later the New York Dolls bridged the gap between rote
    riffage and something louder, faster, leaner and meaner. Ironically, for a band
    with so much history and now a whopping 13 albums to its name, the Saints here
    sounds like they're just getting their feet wet, readying themselves for a
    revolution yet to come. It's the most retro of retro stances, and the results
    are predictably modest. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    ""Other Side of the World"" could be a nice forgotten Johnny
    Thunders ballad, while ""So Close,"" ""Je Fuckin' T'Aime"", and ""Drowning"" sound
    like little not-quite classic garage nuggets/Nuggets. When Bailey gets poppy,
    as he does with ""Getting Away With Murder"", ""Learning to Crawl"", and ""War of
    Independence"" you can hear a bit of Tom Verlaine in his writing, or at least
    Television aficionado Steve Wynn of the Dream Syndicate.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    It's fun but spotty stuff,<span> </span>and ultimately less than impressively mundane. What's
    missing is any real sense of inspiration or imperative, any compelling reason
    for it to exist outside of extending a legacy that many would argue ended at
    the dawn of the 80s. Change the name, or change the direction, but a legendary
    band in name alone does the legend no favors.

    You're not even really reading this. Why would you? I could rate this album a 12 divided by Q or say it's on par with seven ham-and-cheese Hot Pockets and it wouldn't matter. Anyone who cares has already marched to their nearest independent retailer and purchased <em>Excellent Italian Greyhound</em>, laughed aloud at the dog picture, shook the unmarked CD from the gatefold cover (because Steve Albini hates digital recordings-- and <em>you</em>), and spun the vinyl with warm, grating satisfaction. The reviews are irrelevant, and one from Pitchfork probably means even less to Shellac listeners than most.</p><p>
    Shellac's audience is built-in and guaranteed in a way that, despite Touch &amp; Go's perfectly respectable roster, no other active band on the label can claim; they're the last real band standing on the last real label standing. Steve Albini's notorious reputation may precede him, but Shellac have maintained their integrity by cutting out the promoters, the promos, the PR, the interviews, the hype, and the bullshit. Who cares about integrity any more, you ask? Just wait. One day you'll tell your kids who Albini and Ian MacKaye were and get blank stares in return. You'll watch your children grow up to become managers and ""indie"" PR shills for groups with at least two exclamation points in their bandnames while you shout about how ""back in my day, bands used to stand for something"" while slack-jawed, iPod-toting orderlies push your wheelchair in a circle around the nurses' station at the old-folks home. That Shellac continue to seek the shortest path between the music and the fans is a point worth repeating.</p><p>
    Yet there's a point, I think, when the fans will wonder what they're getting beyond a pat on the back. <em>Excellent Italian Greyhound</em> is unique in being one of very few albums anticipated for seven years-- a punk-rock eternity-- that still feels rushed. Albini and Bob Weston are both very busy engineers, and Shellac was never a full-time gig for either of them, <em>or</em> drummer Todd Trainer, so no one within reason gets pissy over the wait between their records. Plus, the band's very occasional live shows (which have thankfully increased in number lately) are still essential life experiences. Of course, you could say the same for a band like Fugazi, whose last release, <em>The Argument,</em> came out way back in 2001: They pushed past boundaries and expectations until the very end before wisely resting on their laurels. Here, Shellac are simply digging in their heels, relishing their in-jokes, and doing what they do best-- and not much else. 
    </p>
<p>
    All that said, <em>EIG</em>'s first half is a holy affirmation, and maybe short of ""Prayer to God"" features the band's best opening track. ""The End of Radio"" is a minimalist three-chord funeral march for (you guessed it) radio, as Albini assumes the character of the last DJ (and man) on earth, screaming dedications to a deserted planet. While the vocals aren't as foaming as they've been during live performances, the more desperate and pathetic tone fits this clever conceit. Albini errantly lets out nervous patter and thanks non-existent sponsors before wailing, <em>""Can you hear me now???""</em> and letting loose with the crackling guitar lines we love Shellac for. ""Steady as She Goes"" is another live staple finally seeing release, exemplary of the thin, metallic chug they've patented, though it's without the tension or left turns of their earlier work. 
    </p>
<p>
    The band saves the stretching out for side two.  ""Lulabelle"" is undoubtedly the strangest and most difficult track to get through: Its heavy riffage is interrupted by a long segment of the Sinatra-like crooning of some pretty unsettling lyrics, plus voiceovers from maybe-movie announcers and Strongbad. The juxtaposition is hilarious and disturbing, and while you may never play it more than a few times, it's the most confrontational the band gets on this record, as well as closest in spirit to <em>At Action Park</em> or Albini's former projects. ""Boycott"" is a quick-and-dirty anti-capitalist rant from Weston, and though the metronome tick of the instrumental ""Kittypants"" strikes me as filler, the other instrumental, ""Paco"", is a vicious highlight with atmosphere that's as sparse and evocative as an Ennio Morricone score.  The odd interlude that introduces ""Spoke"" gives way to straight-up punk rock with unintelligible screaming from both Weston and Albini. I can't help but feel like the joke's on the listener here, but it's hard not to smile at it.</p><p>
    I bring up Fugazi because they're the only of Albini's like-minded contemporaries still (maybe) kicking, and because the Weston-sung ""Elephant"" makes the curious choice of directly quoting them at the start (""Here comes the argument""), before proceeding with some slippery bass chords  and militant rhythms that are pretty darn close to sounding like the flagship Dischord band. Elsewhere, the relentless hammer-ons and spat-out non sequiturs of ""Be Prepared"" (""I was born wearing pants!"") stop abruptly in midstream to start an oddly cheerful groove that sounds not unlike Thin Lizzy. It's a gleeful moment, but there was a time when Shellac barely acknowledged other bands, leaving a blazing trail of influence in their stubborn wake. Not only is <em>Excellent Italian Greyhound</em> Shellac's most off-the-cuff record; it's often an uncharacteristically indebted one. 
    </p>
<p>
    For those of us scratching our heads and laughing at that album cover, anyone who's seen the band live knows that they're hysterical, and <em>EIG, </em>like <em>1000 Hurts</em> before it, proves you can still provoke listeners without being uniformly dour. Even at their silliest, even when they're treading water, no one else sounds quite like Shellac, and anyone who professes to be a serious music fan without having spent quality time with the band's albums should be forced to familiarize themselves. This just wouldn't be the first record I'd force on them.

It's the kind of obsession that bores your friends and alienates folks who casually ask, ""So, heard any good records lately?"" If those people do go on to check out the band, they tend to reply: ""It just sounded like a lot of noise with some dude moaning/yelling about scrapbooking and Whole Foods.""</p><p>
    And that's why it's great! Now signed to obscure boutique label Sub Pop and already on their second album, the brand new <em>Hope For Men</em>, Pissed Jeans' rock is sourced in the early-80s loose-booty sludge of Flipper and Black Flag, the tightly wound treble-spray of late-80s/early-90s noise-rock such as Drunks With Guns and the Jesus Lizard, and a maxed-out Paypal account's worth of hyper-obscure hardcore nobodies who put out one awesome 7"" before permanently taking that job at Orange Julius. It's an ugly sound-- sometimes frenzied (the sawn-off boogie of closer ""My Bad"") and sometimes totally entropic (the glue-huffing feedback-dub bummer ""Scrapbooking"")-- that I can't get enough of. Unlike so much music in 2007, whether it's Justice or the Arcade Fire, Pissed Jeans doesn't want to inflate your sense of euphoria. They want to stub out enthusiasm like a cigarette on a forehead.</p><p>
    Plenty of folks who grew up with hardcore have since moved onto its noisier or artier or less-traditional cousins. (Or they've written it off entirely thanks to the Victory Records version where the multiple T-shirt designs are pretty cool and all the bands fucking suck.) Pissed Jeans singer Matt Korvette also runs the White Denim label, which has put out great, smartly packaged, and obtuse offerings by not-really-hardcore weirdos like Baltimore's tweaked circuit-benders Leprechaun Catering and English improv-rock druids Aufgehoben. And when Pissed Jeans want to, they can certainly delight in noise for noise's sake. Just listen to <em>Hope for Men</em> opener ""People Person"": The buzzing that swarms throughout the song like a B-movie's worth of giant locusts isn't even solid enough to pass for a riff. Those squeals and sobs are like rock music made by sadists who join a seal clubbing expedition because they like the sounds the seals make when clubbed. <em>Hope for Men</em> is generally a little slower and lower than Pissed Jeans' 2005 debut <em>Shallow</em>, like the three-minutes of drunken stumblebum riffs lurching back and forth on ""Fantasy World"" or bad-vibes whirlpool of ""Secret Admirer"". But ""bash first and ask questions later"" tracks like ""A Bad Wind"" and ""Caught Licking Leather"" are reminders of why your tense, agitated ass started listening to punk rock in the first place.</p><p>
    After I wrote about <u><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/42780-pissed-jeans-ive-still-got-you-ice-cream-stream"">""I've Still Got You (Ice Cream)""</a></u>, I was gently chided for treating the lyrics, in which Korvette seems to claim that no matter how bad things get he can still enjoy a frozen treat, in some sort of ironic ""LOL guy is writing a song about ice cream"" way. Not so! What makes Pissed Jeans' lyrics great <em>is</em> the real-world specificity of them. Dude gets bummed. Dude has ice cream. Dude feels better. Who among us can not relate? ""Scrapbooking"", which crawls for five-minutes over broken piano keys and is sung like a version of Black Flag's ""Damaged 1"" written by a dude with a normal-sized neck, appears to be about, you know, scrapbooking. On ""The Jogger"", a few minutes of sewer drip ambience, Korvette beefs about the kind of Whole Foods-shopping, Bally's Fitness Club membership-having, shirt-tucked-in douche who makes the rest of us feel vaguely bad about our record collecting and drinking-unto-blackout lifestyles. And really, whether or not Korvette is dead serious or taking the piss, he knows, like all great comedians, that it's at least 75% in the pained, sexually frustrated, stubbed-toe delivery. If you've just been fired or dumped and are currently contemplating either drinking an entire case of generic beer or setting an orphanage on fire, this is the album for you.</p><p>
    When life got too heavy in 2006, and it often was, I listened to <em>Shallow</em>, laughed my ass off, and felt better. <em>Hope for Men</em> makes me laugh even harder. (And, you know, bang my head, kick over newspaper boxes, bare my teeth at small children, want to form a Halo of Flies cover band, stuff like that.) Listening, I was often reminded of Lester Bangs famously playing a suicidal friend Public Image Ltd.'s ambivalent death dirge ""Theme""-- the track's another good sonic reference point for Pissed Jeans, come to think of it-- and asking if John Lydon groaning ""And I wish I could die"" over and over again was therapeutic in any way. The joke of the small indignities and crushing defeats is on all of us, and <em>Hope for Men</em> is currently one of the few records you should pull out-- both at your darkest moments and just the times when some jerkoff gets the last bagel at Dunkin' Donuts in the morning-- to remind yourself that no matter how many times you catch your dick in your zipper, metaphorically or literally, it's better to laugh along. That, and there's always ice cream.<br/></p></div>"|10311.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10311-hope-for-men/|8.1|Jess Harvell

For those half-to-fully-baked music fans who gloriously tripped on Mr. Stephen McBean's wild retro-rock ride, Black Mountain, don't go expecting a similar buzz from sobering side project Lightning Dust. Sure, they sound like they're named after a volatile drug combination (PCP and pop rocks?), but as Lightning Dust, Black Mountaineers Amber Webber and Joshua Wells seek better living through histrionics, not chemistry. Fortunately, they didn't also kick their awesomely nasty late 60s/early 70s rock habit, making their self-titled debut just as potent a blast from the past as their full-time band.</p><p>
    Webber's dour vocals attracted some criticism on <em>Black Mountain</em>, and in the context of that free-wheelin' album, the gripes are somewhat fair. However, with opening track ""Listening On"", Webber and Wells make no bones about the pall cast over their new incarnation. Like nearly every track on the LP, you can count the total instrument and vocal parts on one hand, a compositional illusion that seems to catapult Webber's stark quivering wails out of your speakers. Even ghostlier, the absence of percussion and other auxiliary touches helps to create ephemeral melodies that materialize briefly, only to vanish at the delicate touch of an organ key.</p><p>
    As sparse as the duo's toolbox appears, their album has a pronounced dramatic landscape of suspenseful highs and tranquilized lows, thanks both to Webber's powerful emoting and Wells' ivory-tickling flair. ""Castles and Caves"", the album's five-and-a-half minute centerpiece, consists only of piano, vocals and a brief cello part, but when those left-hand keys are pounded during the final chorus, they pack the gravitas of a full-blown orchestra. It doesn't hurt that the piano riff lifts King Crimson's ""In the Court of the Crimson King"", though, as so many Black Mountain reviews point out in nauseating detail, these guys clearly aren't afraid of walking the line between artistic gesturing and flat-out mimicry.</p><p>
    However, while very transparent influences sometimes hamper Black Mountain's music, Lightning Dust racks up a much smaller tab borrowing classic rock ideas. Instead, sheer paucity, a typical symptom of side projects, plagues the duo. With ten tracks clocking just over a half-hour, the debut whets the palette but fails to satiate the stomach, instead leaving us with brief, majestic tracks that hint at something more epic. Although catchy, haunting three-minute howls like ""Highway"" or ""Breathe"" come as second nature to the duo, their attempts at curveballs and changeups miss the mark, as drab hoedown ""Wind Me Up"" and gooey FM ballad ""When You Go"" respectively show. Still, when these two stick to their comfort zone, they make magic happen, proving Lightning Dust to be another crag on Black Mountain worth scaling.</p></div>"|10278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10278-lightning-dust/|7.2|Adam Moerder

    music of the past 100 years, but pity the poor musician who actually
    tries to push its boundaries. While Eric Clapton and John Mayer reap untold
    fortunes toeing the middle, the most interesting variations of the blues often
    go marginalized as edgy niche offerings. Veer too far from tradition and you're
    likely to be considered separate from that tradition entirely.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    To be fair, James Blood Ulmer is a bluesman only in the sense
    that Ulmer's onetime mentor Ornette Coleman is a bluesman. Yes, the blues is
    there, but such reductionism only captures part of the picture. Indeed, Ulmer's
    always been predisposed to Coleman's harmolodic theory of rhythmic convergence,
    especially as applied to jazz and funk, and though the blues isn't typically
    busy enough to take total advantage of Coleman's pioneering crosscurrents,
    Ulmer's been working overtime all the same to mesh his divergent influences.
    </p><p>
    He's been on a roll, too, embracing a brand of far from
    smooth blues with newfound vigor. 2001's <em>Memphis Blood: The Sun Sessions</em> teamed Ulmer with guitarist/producer
    Vernon Reid (of Living Colour fame), and the chemistry was perfect; one
    shouldn't forget Reid cut his teeth with former Ulmer and former Coleman
    bandmate/fellow harmolodic traveler Ronald Shannon Jackson. With Ulmer at his
    best using the blues as a jumping off point for his trademark jagged solos,
    often delivered in tandem with Reid's distinctly less-traditional playing, 2003
    saw the arrival of <em>No Escape from the Blues: The Electric Lady Sessions</em>,
    which kept the train a-rollin', as it were, summoning equal parts Hendrix and
    Howlin' Wolf. 
    </p>
<p>
    2005's beautiful, haunting solo venture <em>Birthright</em> aside, <em>Bad Blood in the City: The Piety Street Sessions</em>, continues Ulmer's electric
    odyssey with a handful of original compositions supplementing some choice
    covers, simultaneously platforms for social criticism and launching pads for
    some colliding guitar duels. 
    </p>
<p>
    Once again, Reid produced the album, and once again Ulmer
    chose a historic studio to set the mood: From Sun to Electric Lady and now to
    New Orleans' Piety Street. The setting is wholly appropriate, as few cities
    have earned to right to own the blues in the 21<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 9.16667px"">st</span> century as
    obviously as New Orleans has. The city's rife with heartache and heartbreak,
    teetering in purgatory on the brink between urban revival and ghost town. 
    </p>
<p>
    Needless to say, Ulmer's got hurricanes and floods on the
    mind, too, and the album begins with the Ulmer original ""Survivors of the
    Hurricane"". Coming off the spare but hardly subdued <em>Birthright,</em> the slamming
    New Orleans funk and searing electric guitar comes as something of a shock, but
    a welcome shock at that. This isn't the mournful blues but its angry, riled-up
    cousin, and the killer playing reflects that. 
    </p>
<p>
    On Junior Kimbrough's ""Sad Days, Lonely Nights"", Ulmer sings
    like he's been gargling paint thinner, while his band (including Reid on banjo
    and guitar, and longtime compadre Charles Burnham on violin and mandolin)
    provides the perfect complements of swinging rhythm and steady pulse. ""Katrina""
    is slightly more somber, though far from toothless, yet ""Let's Talk About
    Jesus"" (featuring singer Irene Datcher) is a more optimistic hunk of
    gospel-soul, a wash of wah-wah guitars, dancing percussion and Hammond organ
    bouncing off one another while Ulmer preaches the Christian ethic of charity
    that seems to have left New Orleans behind.
    </p>
<p>
    In terms of tribute, Ulmer hits up all the big names-- John
    Lee Hooker's ""This Land is Nobody's Land"", Willie Dixon's cynical ""Dead
    Presidents"", Howlin' Wolf's ""Commit a Crime"", and Son House's ""Grinnin' in Your
    Face""-- but recontextualizes them to fit the album's theme of hard times
    Crescent City rebirth. ""This is a burial ground, and I don't know why,"" Ulmer
    singers in the voodooed-up ""This Land Is Nobody's Land"", but one suspects Ulmer
    knows the answer. In fact, it may even have something to do with those dead
    presidents.
    </p>
<p>
    After this salvo, Ulmer may be preaching to the converted
    when he sings ""There Is Power in the Blues"", though he chooses to end the album on a more accusatory note
    with ""Old Slave Master"", which lists the Katrina aftermath as just the latest
    in the long line of wrongs that have trapped millions of Americans in seemingly
    unchangeable circumstances. It's
    an astute and natural way to underscore the blues as a living thing, not just
    the sum of its traditions, still mutating and moving forward to encompass
    whatever it encounters. From the sound of things, we shouldn't count Ulmer as
    one of the trapped.

Instead, his appeal rests on three pillars: his overdriven Tony Robbins motivational-speaker rhetoric, his usually-multitracked slow-motion groan, and the churning, monolithic doom-rap production style pioneered by frequent collaborator Shawty Redd. Those three selling-points don't look like much on paper, but they were enough to make for two compulsively listenable albums. <em>Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101</em> and <em>The Inspiration</em> both shifted more than a million copies in a period when albums aren't selling well at all, and they did it on the strength of the triumphantly larger-than-life persona that Jeezy's created for himself. When those three pillars come together right, Jeezy sounds enormous. Without them, he'd be nothing, and that's why you never hear him on tracks that don't match his singular aesthetic. But <em>Cold Summer</em>, the new album from Jeezy's group USDA, mostly does away with the sweeping production and the success-above-all exhortations. When Jeezy is alongside compatriots Slick Pulla and Bloodraw, he loses his emotional strive, instead bullshitting about the day-to-day minutia of drug-dealing. And the production mostly comes from relatively anonymous and untested unknowns, all doing their best to approximate Shawty Redd's titanic lurch and only occasionally succeeding. As for Jeezy's voice, it takes up a whole lot less space, leaving room for his less distinctive friends. And still Def Jam released <em>Cold Summer</em>, and it debuted in Billboard's top five, selling nearly 100,000 copies in its first week. Young Jeezy is good at what he does.</p><p>
<em>
    Cold Summer</em> is just the latest in a near-endless string of entourage albums. Whenever a rapper finds success these days, it seems inevitable that he'll eventually scoop up a bunch of hometown buddies and throw them all on an album. Every once in a while, these albums will exploit the hell out of a couple of powerful new voices and build on the established star's appeal; Tha Dogg Pound's <em>Dogg Food</em> immediately springs to mind. More often, though, these albums come off as quickie cash-grabs, diluting their stars' talents and letting a bunch of lesser talents waste everybody's time; consider, if you will, the St. Lunatics' <em>Free City</em>. <em>Cold Summer</em> mostly fits into the latter category; Slick Pulla and Bloodraw lack Jeezy's worldbeating charisma, and Jeezy more often than not descends to their level over the course of the album. Legend has it that Slick Pulla is the guy who first convinced Jeezy to rap, but his husky, punchline-heavy style never makes much of an impression. Pulla had a scene-stealing verse on the original version of Jeezy's ""Trap or Die"": ""Don't talk to square niggas, you know, Spongebobs/ Kanye West niggas, talkin' through the wire, dog."" On <em>Cold Summer</em>, though, his most quotable line is this: ""The shields in this bitch; we seek and destroy/ Your boy got a mind like Sigmund Freud."" That's just not going to cut it. As for Bloodraw, his singsong wheeze blurs into the background more often than not. Bloodraw and Pulla aren't terrible or anything, but they both share space with a genuine star, and both sound workmanlike and indistinct in comparison. As for Jeezy, his sense of purpose only rarely surfaces; for the most part, he's content to kick banalities alongside his friends.</p><p>
    The album has a few bright spots. The regal horns of opener ""Focus"" animate the song's trap-rap cliches. ""Check"" boasts disorienting waves of swarming synths and a Bloodraw chorus that actually works. ""Live My Life"", with its shimmering acoustic guitars and its warm, slow glide of a chorus from Outkast-affiliated crooner Scar, is genuinely pretty. But most of the tracks here sound chintzy and samey, their bargain-basement beats melting into a tedious lump and bottoming out with a remarkably unseductive troika of sex-songs at the middle of the album. We've been hearing a lot of these entourage albums lately, but most of them have been coming out on Koch, an indie-label apparently willing to release music from the crews of B-list rappers like Slim Thug and B.G. I can't for the life of me figure out why Def Jam, still the most important rap label in existence, would take a flier on the two jokers who stand next to Jeezy onstage, and maybe it's telling that the resulting record sounds for all the world like a Koch product. The single best moment on <em>Cold Summer </em>comes at the end of the album: the remix of <em>The Inspiration</em> single ""Go Getta"", which features strong and memorable guest appearances from Bun B and Jadakiss. Slick Pulla and Bloodraw, appropriately enough, are nowhere to be found.</p></div>"|10282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10282-cold-summer/|4.5|Tom Breihan

    A few months ago, on a weeknight when I just wanted to catch the ""American Idol"" results and be in bed at a reasonable time, I was coaxed out by some friends to catch a set by those young, Manic Panic-coiffed Brazilian indie kids Bonde Do Role. Tired and cranky, I gave Bonde my best arms-folded, disdainful rock critic ice grill for as long as my shriveled Grinch heart could hold out. I wasn't quite sure when the band finally won me over-- was it the track that chopped up Europe's ""The Final Countdown"" or when singer Marina Vello stuffed her microphone down the front of her tights and began air-humping with Pretty Ricky vigor?-- but my crankiness quickly melted away in the face of the trio's pungent and playful shtick, oversexed and overdosed on the beat from Tone-Loc's ""Wild Thing"".<br/></p><p>
    Bonde do Role are constantly bracketed with CSS and Diplo in the press. The Diplo
    connection is obvious: The dilettante cratedigger discovered them on a
    vacation to Rio and released an earlier EP on his boutique
    label, Mad Decent. But forget the association with CSS, the adorable day-glo cult cargo
    that washed up on American shores at roughly the
    same time: They may share an unusual fashion sense (Marina, sporting a Paul Revere and the Raiders-style pudding-bowl haircut, stuffs herself into a pair of too-tight leopard print
    stretch pants), but Bonde's jones for baile funk, the popular fusion of hip-house, Miami bass, and Latin beats that rose to international prominence in recent years, thanks in part to championing from a number of acclaimed DJs, sets them apart.<br/>
<em></em></p><p>
<em>With Lasers</em>, the group's debut album, opens with a Van Halen hammer-on, Gregorian chanting, and a growling computer voice that falls halfway between Vincent Price and the iron man who kicked off Rob Base and DJ EZ-Rock's ""It Takes Two"". And what we get for the rest of the album isn't so much indie kids versioning baile funk as... antmusic! Maybe it's just the fact that 10 of its 12 songs clock in under three minutes (some barely squeak to two), or that the platonic baile funk beat sounds so much like an off-brand Latin version of the Burundi stomp with some added Salt-N-Pepa snap and pop, but you can totally imagine Marina as the take-no-shit 21st-century Annabella Lwin with bandmates Pedro D'Eyrot and Rodrigo Gorky acting as the two-man Bow Wow Wow behind her-- especially on ""James Bonde"", with its distorto-twang surf guitar, or the Bo Diddley cruise-ship sound of ""Tieta"".</p><p>
    Bonde do Role may have inherited their homeland's love of really crappy sounding 808s and breakbeats that rattle like coconuts in the breeze, but they friggin' <em>love</em> cheesy guitars. I mean, terrible sports bar blues-band buttrock licks and 90s grunge grunts (an earlier single turned the detuned wah riff of Alice in Chains' ""Man in the Box"" into a dance hook), and the hairiest of hair metal. Just like baile funk. And also like baile funk, you can't really describe it as ""ersatz"" because the whole genre is ersatz as fuck, and Bonde's baile is one, two steps from the ""real"" thing.  Cheerleader chants and horny panting! Incredibly cheap programmed drums and pop culture quotes! Booty bass beats and inexplicable Afrika Bambaataa shoutouts played on Todd Terry's vocal-chopping keyboard! (Bonde loves the vocal stutter effect almost as much as they love guitars.) As with baile funk, this low-budget throwback is an aesthetic virtue for Bonde do Role. It's a building block-- the horns on ""Tieta"" are as tinny and off-the-rack as any Trinidadian soca hit, while ""Caminhao de Gas"" rocks  and the 8-bit video game hook-- not a necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention third-world practicality.</p><p>
    Those of us lacking a functional understanding of Portuguese will have to approach the chants as universal party-starting sex-urge noises that go beyond language-- which isn't hard to do, really, since Bonde probably aren't exactly flipping Rakim or Lil' Wayne level metaphor. If <em>With Lasers</em> suffers for anything, it's the fact that no one's figured out a way to get sweaty leopard print crotches onto CDs just yet. I do wonder how much of my enjoyment derives from my memories of the Bonde do Role live gig and its awkward but non-ironic booty popping, pheromones, and spilled beer. But there's still a lot of pleasure to be had during the humid months this year  in imagining the Bonde kids shaking their barely-legal, jiggling stuff as they trade off raps on record like Run-DMC. And if you're part of the generation that's erased the distance between dancing and dry humping, <em>With Lasers</em> should easily get you through a long, hot summer of awkward hook-ups at backyard barbecues.

When
    they hit the ground running in the late 1990s, they were greeted with such an
    intense blizzard of critical acclaim that they were damned never to live
    up to the expectations set for them. Their fingerprint, first established on a series of excellent early EPs and solidified on their
    unremittingly brilliant debut album <em>Internal Wrangler</em>, is unmistakable: Drawing from dub, surf-rock, doo-wop, psych, British jazz, girl
    groups, the Velvet Underground, and everything in between, it's a sound that stimulates countless record-collector pleasure centers. And yet, for whatever reason, their successive albums have all felt relatively lacking, failing to fully recapture the diversity of their debut.</p><p>
    Now comes <em>Funf</em>, a collection of odds and ends pulled from the steady flow of three-song singles that have
    accompanied each of Clinic's albums, covering the period from <em>Internal Wrangler</em> through last year's <em>Visitations.</em> Funny enough, the random, fractured flow of the disc is the closest the band has come to recreating the aesthetic their fans have pined for since<em> Walking With Thee</em> changed the script
    with its consistent, icy sound. Unfortunately, the quality of the material widely varies.</p><p>
    The
    disc opens with ""The Majestic"", from the ""Return of Evil Bill"" single, an instrumental track that might have served as an alternate <em>Internal
    Wrangler</em> opener if ""Voodoo Wop"" hadn't bettered it. Radiating the haunted surf
    vibe Clinic have often explored, it packs enough material for a whole suite into just
    two minutes. The alpha, however, is quickly followed by the omega: ""The
    Magician"" B-side ""Nicht"" is just horrible, an overdistorted punk rant that
    transforms familiar Clinic territory into a dense, impenetrable mess. Nothing else on <em>Funf</em> approaches this nadir, but much of
    it comes off as subpar variations on sounds they've delivered more capably elsewhere. The
    ""Second Line"" single's ""Magic Boots"" is like a less memorable, vocal version of
    ""Hippie Death Suite"", for instance, while ""Christmas"" (off ""Come Into Our
    Room"") falls somewhere between ""Earth Angel"" and ""Goodnight Georgie"". With its
    jazz-inflected, smoothly flowing guitar part and well-placed hook, ""Christmas"" is something of a rarity on <em>Funf</em>: a well-executed run that actually earns its inclusion.<br/>
</p><p>
    There are a couple of others here that deserve another look. ""The Castle"" (from the flip of ""The Return of Evil Bill"") is one of the record's best tracks, employing the
    overdriven organ sound of ""2nd Foot Stomp"" and spotlighting a classic, clenched-teeth vocal from frontman Ade Blackburn. ""Lee Shan"",
    originally a B-side to ""Harvest (Within You)"", rides a repeated piano phrase
    through a cavern of Spector-esque reverb, but instead of a Carole Kaye bassline
    and a soaring vocal, we get Blackburn's paranoia and nail-biting surf guitar
    with a bit of spooky reed organ. It's a good example of Clinic doing their best
    to subvert the expectations set up by the obviousness of the
    influences at work in their music. 
    </p>
<p>
    Apart from these, there are a couple of surf-style tracks that sound
    kind of cool but don't feature much in the way of melody, some other tracks that were
    obviously left aside in favor of better ones, and a handful of go-nowhere experiments like
    ""Dissolution; The Dream of Bartholomew"", which aimlessly meanders between
    passages of stinging fuzz guitar and twinkly noises. Clinic completists aren't likely to find much of note here, as they'll already own all of these tracks and more (the collection is far from definitive, leaving off several b-sides, including ""Stardust"",
    ""The Sphinx"", ""Saxon Road"", ""Cutting Grass"", and ""Mechanical Madrigal""), but those open to traversing the band's more haphazard experiments may find a few fleeting moments of worth.

Condoleeza Rice rape jokes and ""flied lice"" prank calls to Chinese restaurants aren't just goony shock-jock hijinx, they're the signs of an arrogant sense of bad-boy entitlement that values offense as the driving force of humor instead of a potential side effect. Worse still, these ideas of what makes for outrageous humor are depressingly uniform: A 2003 <em>Entertainment Weekly </em>article revealed that, when pressed for accounts of the ""craziest thing ever done in their studio,"" three different DJs from three distinct regions of the country all answered to the effect of a woman spraying some sort of beverage out of an anatomical region invariably referred to using baby-talk euphemisms. <em>Rock and roll!</em></p><p>
    For roughly 10 years, radio host/comedy writer Tom Scharpling and Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster have built on that uncomfortable dynamic in an escalatingly absurd and elaborate fashion, and there's a pointed jab at the current character of American radio and its listeners beneath the surface of their call-in sketches. Despite the often-irritable undercurrent to his radio program <em>The Best Show on WFMU</em>, Scharpling is the quintessential demoralized straight man: Frequently lamenting the craziness of his callers, snapping ""GET OFF MY PHONE"" at some of the more problematic cases, and preemptively warning the addled listener on the other end of the line to steer clear of ""toilet talk""; many of his conversations with callers end with a rapidly-deflating, high-pitched sigh, as though he considers himself lucky to get out of that exchange alive.</p><p>
    The other half of the <em>The Best Show</em> team is Wurster, who regularly calls in as a character whose belligerence, delusion, ignorance, or just plain sociopathy ricochets madly off Scharpling's uneasy attempts to make sense out of the situation, and that's where <em>The Art of the Slap</em> gets its material. This 3xCD set is the fifth in a series of releases that dates back to the original 1997 bit ""Rock, Rot &amp; Rule"", and while it skews a bit weirder than previous entries-- Tom has an extended conversation with a carp-- it still sticks with what works. The Scharpling &amp; Wurster formula is airtight: Tom takes a call from a vaguely shady-sounding man who usually has prior business with Tom or, alternately, some sort of response to something said at some previous point during the show. The conversation goes smoothly for a few minutes until Wurster's caller lets some uncomfortable detail slip and everything starts to unravel in a horrific mess: The guys who were supposed to repair Tom's computer are a bunch of roid-raging jocks who opted to smash his PC instead; a tornado survivor who pledged to turn his life around two years ago is calling back to hawk his ""Pimp City"" video game and a series of celebrity blackmail videos; the carp turns out to be a fratboyish jerk. Things inevitably go sour, and Tom finds himself the brunt of some sort of elaborate impending threat, assuming the caller doesn't have his own to worry about. And it all builds to a peak over the course of twenty-plus minutes. (Unsurprisingly, the duo ply their trade on community radio, where this kind of indulgence gets appropriate breathing room; an episode last December condensed the previous week's bit into a two-minute commercial ""morning zoo"" pace and it landed with a thud.)</p><p>
    Naturally, it's how the two riff on the structure that makes each bit. Wurster tends to drop several reoccurring catchphrases (""Define…,"" ""Yes, why?"", ""Wait, whaaaat?"") that wryly betray his character's dimbulb obliviousness, and while he doesn't have the most versatile or easily-disguised voice-- listen for three weeks and you'll be able to spot a Wurster call a mile away-- he manages to find a way to make each call unpredictable. Scharpling is largely left to react, which he does with superb comedic timing; often all he needs to do is skeptically repeat one of Wurster's more ridiculous assertions or laugh in incredulous horror to keep the momentum going. Some bits tend to wander thematically, like ""Postal Slap Fight"", which starts as a tirade against Tom's music snobbery and subsequently covers subjects ranging from the merits of ""Vice President Lon Chaney"" to the fictional Alan Alda/Brendan Fraser movie <em>President Baseball</em> to the caller's professional slap-fighting league. Others feature an extended scenario, like horror film auteur Trent L. Strauss (director of <em>You're Soaking in Her</em> and <em>Art School Arsonist</em>) laying out the entire plot of his ludicrous upcoming project <em>The Toolbelt Killer</em>: it's a movie about a disfigured Lowe's employee who enacts revenge against the town that shunned him for coming from the wrong side of the tracks-- the rich side.</p><p>
    The undisputed highlight of the set is the ""bonus CD"" detailing the triumph and tragedy of alt-rock remainder bin fodder Mother 13, who planned to conquer the music world by becoming the first band to play Mt. Everest. Part 1 features the arrogant, preening alt-rock frontman Corey Harris, whose band plies its trade at assorted corporate-sponsored festivals such as the Huggies <em>Fall Into Softness Tour</em>, hyping the all-star bill and detailing his regimen of mountaineer training-- which mostly involves beer and a fake rock-climbing wall at a local shopping mall. Part 2, recorded a week later, is the grisly aftermath, in which a wheezy, whimpering Harris elaborates on a morbid but uncomfortably hilarious series of disasters: Buddy Guy dies during the ascent and is abandoned in a ""blues igloo"", Clarence Clemons comes down with snow madness and commits unthinkable acts of cannibalism, and a member of the Polyphonic Spree falls off the peak; since the band is roped together, he brings them all down with him. ""Wow,"" Scharpling concludes at the end of the call, ""this kinda puts a damper on the show."" It also makes <em>The Art of the Slap</em> one of the easiest comedy record recommendations of the year, proof that shock and provocation work best when it's the host who's taking the brunt.</p></div>"|10276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10276-the-art-of-the-slap/|8.5|Nate Patrin

    There is more luster to the Icelandic, 14-member Benni
    Hemm Hemm's second album, as the brassy pomp of their self-titled debut is mostly
    abandoned, or tucked into the opening and closing corners of each piece. In its
    place are the shimmers of the guitar and delicate wind passages:
    ""Brekkan"" is content to have a glockenspiel and strings sift lazily
    through the pretty three-note descents of the brass which, though usually
    overpowering, back off to give the drums and bass center stage. What the album
    mostly figures as is an understated decoration of a landscape: the few repeated
    words of ""Snjórljóssnjór"" and its locomotive rhythm, or the dusty
    desert suggested in the banjo strums of ""Stoffer"".</p><p>
    But the pulse of <em>Kajak</em> turns out to be measured by
    those punchy hodgepodge introductions and exits, where cymbals, strings, and
    all manner of brass crash in unison, thus forming the lump of material from
    which the meat of a song is carved. The ""meat,"" particularly on
    ""Stoffer"" and finale ""Egísa"", can suffer by being whittled
    away to almost nothing, resulting in listless rhythms, epically held notes, and
    rocking-chair guitar patterns. Sometimes, as on ""Abbastúfur"", this
    stripping away works: Benedikt Hermannsson conducts bass and tenor male
    vocalists around the soft and glittering sounds of the guitar. The full,
    flawless sound of this chorus is one of the best features on the album, and
    reappears later on ""Ég á bát"". When the song builds to include basic
    punches of percussion, the brass threatens to overpower the human voices, but
    in the end each part perfectly complements the other.</p><p>
    There was considerably more English on the debut, but it seems inconsequential
    here that the lyrics are in Icelandic. ""Sex eða sjö"" is another quiet
    number that succeeds because it's pulled out of somnambulism by marching drums,
    another strong chorus, and most of all, the deep vocal lines. The urgency of
    many instruments joining in sets many of the songs apart from the ruminative,
    airy acoustics of a song like ""Ég á bát"". Still, by changing up predictable
    guitar chords just slightly-- by hollowing them out and creating surprising
    vocal harmonies around them-- the songs become summery memorabilia as opposed
    to forgettable. But for almost every one to finish with a bombast flourish à la
    Neutral Milk Hotel can be frustrating, and when such colorful volume is fully
    embraced (""Mónakó""), the song is too brief, its consistent 1:49 of

    Immediately on the Only Children's second album, Josh
    Berwanger makes his frustrations known: over a determined Stones riff on
    ""Tired of this Town"", the former Anniversary frontman and indie lifer
    sings, ""Tired of being wrong/ Tired of singing songs/ Tired of not acting
    my age."" The nine songs that follow on <em>Keeper of Youth </em>elaborate on
    his disappointments, some of which are well founded, others a little tiresome.
    Certainly Berwanger and his band are entitled to them: he's been making music
    for nearly a decade, a once-hyped artist surpassed by many subsequent
    flavors-of-the-month and now an outsider proud of his flyover-state heritage.
    The Kansas-based Only Children express this wizened anomie with a bar-band
    ethos that glorifies immediate riffs, unpretentious lyrics, chorus hooks that
    make a virtue of predictability, and the mournful country flourish of pedal
    steel. It's classic rock freighted with punk dissent.</p><p>
    The Only Children make it work often on <em>Keeper of
    Youth</em>, but their mission gets the better of them. The melodramatic strings
    on the title track and the convincing reggae rhythms of ""Hide Your
    Sorrow"" fare much better than the ridiculous gospel posturing of
    ""Amen Amen"". Heidi-Lynne Gluck's feminine vocals nicely complement
    Berwanger's howl on ""Invisible Streets"" and the quiet closer
    ""Blackheart of Life"". ""1969"" starts with a near-perfect
    rock couplet: ""Said you were leavin'/ And then you stole my car,"" but
    Berwanger screws it up almost immediately: ""Said you'd feel a whole lot
    better/ Drivin' some place [wait for it] far.""</p><p>
    The reigning tone of <em>Keeper of Youth</em> is prideful
    nostalgia. Berwanger glories in looking backwards for inspiration and guidance,
    but he too readily buys into classic rock myths that should have faded away
    when baby boomers started subscribing to <em>Modern Maturity</em>. ""What
    happened to the spirit of rock and roll/ I guess it died a long time ago,""
    he sings on ""Invisible Streets"". ""But that ain't true/ Do you
    remember Dylan and the Rolling Stones, Muddy Waters and the Ramones..."" Please, tell us more about these good ol' days when
    music mattered. ""Dusty Magazines"" wants it both ways: after
    lambasting critics, Berwanger bitches about record labels whose next-big-thing
    tunnel vision has generated so much crappy music. But he's just preaching to
    the choir. A truly controversial statement illustrates how readily the Only
    Children would change places with the popular bands: ""My band's got what
    it takes/ But we just can't catch a break."" It'd probably be heartbreaking
    if it didn't sound so self-pitying. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Keeper of Youth</em> recalls another
    state-of-the-indie-career album: the Wrens' <em>Meadowlands</em>, a wrenching
    collection of songs about lives wasted in the indie trenches. The comparison is
    instructive and the artists' frustrations similarly sympathetic, but instead of
    playing like their live(lihood)s depend on it, the Only Children sound like
    they're retreating into their record collection. Even though their bitterness
    was more acute, the Wrens' frustrations felt more universal, to the extent that
    <em>Meadowlands</em> perfectly expresses every thirty-year-old's sense of time
    wasted and opportunities lost.<em> Keeper of Youth</em>, on the other hand,
    sounds like the Only Children are too tired to see beyond themselves.

He'd already proven, both under his own name (recording for Ghostly and its Spectral sublabel) and as False (for Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 and Minus labels) and Jabberjaw (for Perlon), that he could stretch and twist his Slinky-like tracks to traverse any hairpin of techno's staircase. Now, word was, Dear was turning towards even greater accessibility with a record that would bring a new sense of songform to his gritty, agreeable beat structures.</p><p>
    But while six of <em>Backstroke</em>'s eight tracks featured vocals (as did ""Dog Days"") and fell into the occasional verse/chorus structure, the record failed to deliver Dear a wider audience. His voice, even with its odd pitch, put its shoulder to the wheel in the service of pop, but the tires were worn from burning rubber behind a disco stoplight; its tracks felt like retreads-- cracked, wobbly, a little thin. I still enjoy the record, but compared to the staggeringly confident tracks Dear released as Audion in just the last year -- ""Mouth to Mouth"", ""I Gave You Away"", remixes for Claude VonStroke, Hot Chip, and Black Strobe, anthems all-- it's difficult to hear <em>Backstroke</em> as the work of the same individual.</p><p>
    With his new album, <em>Asa Breed</em>, Dear finally makes good on his long-awaited metamorphosis. It's not that the record is a straightforward pop romp: It's still anchored in Dear's lumbering beats, its rhythms cobbled together from misfiring drum machines and colored with barely-in-tune keyboards and yellowing room tone. Still, Dear pulls together his widest array of elements yet, not just in terms of instrumentation-- electric and acoustic guitars, live drums, and haphazard percussion all play strong roles-- but also style: Hints of new wave, indie rock, Afropop, and even country enliven <em>Asa Breed</em>. Dear's mercurial approach to genre, however, feels less like dabbling than a kind of shambling dandyism, trying on mismatched styles with a sidelong wink in the mirror.
    </p><p>
    The most immediate change is that Dear's voice now sits front-and-center in every track. Actually, make that front-and-center and side-to-side: Virtually every song features two- or three-part, multitracked vocals, encompassing his natural baritone, a more idiosyncratic midrange, and finally a warbly falsetto, generally digitally smeared as a sort of pitch-correction. It's not the greatest voice in the world, but he uses it well, sliding into the notes, lingering on his vowels, and greasing the mechanistic clutter of his backing tracks. It's a suggestive and evocative voice, though exactly what's being suggested is often left ambiguous. On the downcast ""Deserter"" it's impossible to miss the influence of Joy Division's Ian Curtis; on the ruminative ""Fleece on Brain"", his backing <em>Ooh-ooh</em>s sound like a scrap of 1960s pop that's wafted in on some errant, psychedelic gust. Sometimes, the vocals themselves mutate into something approaching pure musicality, more sensibility than sense: On ""Will Gravity Win Tonight?"" it might take you dozens of listens to realize that the background babble is really the mantra-like repetition, ""More work to be done.""
    </p>
<p>
<em>Asa Breed</em> is a moody record, thanks in no small part to its affirmational lyrics and plaintive guitars. Some critics have found fault with Dear's way with words, and he does occasionally misstep, but more often than not, his slightly cryptic character sketches work well, allowing ambiguous narratives to sprout from the cracked pavement of his productions. The lyrics invite all manner of questions. Who are ""Don and Sherri""? If love is ""such a tricky thing/ Can include diamond rings,"" is that a good or a bad thing? (Dear is married.) And in a record so filled with self-doubt, how much is pure literary invention, and how much points to a crack in the artist's own psyche? It's so rare to get any sense of dance artists' personae that Dear's ambiguous, occasionally confessional lyrics take on extra weight. Part of the pleasure of <em>Asa Breed</em> is its introduction of a character we've never met before; Dear's reluctance to reveal only sends you back into the music looking for answers. (Some of those answers will surprise you: the closing country dirge ""Vine to Vine"", featuring a Johnny Cash-like spoken word drawl, is about a paternal ancestor of Dear's that was allegedly gunned down by Texas Rangers over a century ago.)
    </p>
<p>
    The other thing that keeps me returning to <em>Asa Breed</em> again and again, beyond its individual songs' inventive, engrossing composition and production, is the pacing of the album. It's moody, yes-- even a jaunty track like ""Fleece on Brain"" feels haunted and fraught with anxiety-- but the record's sequence pinballs from brassy electric bumpers to pensive pits and suspenseful pauses. The first four songs seem to circle a common mood as if poking and prodding from every angle, shining a Maglite in the recesses of a deep funk. (The way he wields phrases suggests the minimalist he's always been, twisting and spinning a few sinewy strands into a rope as tough as woven steel; you can hear Audion's druggy abandon throughout, in slow, grinding synthesizers and tones that change color as gradually as a darkening, stormbound sky.) With ""Elementary Lover"", Dear abruptly changes course, channeling the Tom Tom Club. ""Don and Sherri"" plunges back into the murk of a humid dance floor. ""Will Gravity Win Tonight?"" is bitter black tea as a sort of palate cleanser; ""Pom Pom"" is a bizarre, Beach Boys-influenced miniature (at 2:39, it's the shortest song on the album, by two seconds); ""Death to Feelers"" is a kindergarten tale of unrequited love for toy piano and tambourine. And the last four songs usher us out in a kind of extended dream sequence of organs, acoustic guitars, country yelps, the Sea and Cake lounge jazz, and the totally unexpected American Gothic of ""Vine to Vine"".
    </p>
<p>
    Maybe it's because Dear has worked on the album, off and on, for the past three years that its stylistic drift is so wide; what's remarkable is how well all the pieces sit together, and how convincingly they lay out a series of stepping stones. Ultimately, the path leads back inside the album itself, breeding as many questions as certainties. One thing remains clear, though: As producer, songwriter and persona, Dear has come into his own with <em>Asa Breed</em>, a bootstrapping album that not only reveals the miles walked, but an ambitious road map ahead.

    More than any other R. Kelly release, <em>Live! The
    Light It Up Tour</em> encapsulates the man, the myth, and the freak in all his singular insanity. Like an unholy cross between Marvin Gaye and Peter Sellers, the r&amp;b architect plays several roles throughout the performance, from booty-ogling King Dong to Patrón-popping master of ceremonies, but none is more indelible than R. Kelly: Singing Comedian.</p><p>
    On
    an extended version of ""In the Kitchen"", Kells dry humps an imaginary
    cooking buddy with the vigor of five Emerils before bringing out
    a chubby dude with an Abe Lincoln beard and sleeve tats to launch some R.
    Kelly apparel into the cheap seats with a t-shirt bazooka. (He does all this while wearing an R. Kelly t-shirt himself.) After singing the lines,
    ""I gotcha so wet, it's like a rainforest/ Like
    <em>Jurassic Park</em>
    except I'm your sexasaurus baby,"" in the middle of an a cappella version of
    new song ""The Zoo"", he's greeted with a mix of incredulous screams
    and laughs. ""There's such a thing as a sexasaurus,"" deadpans Kelly. ""The Zoo"" is only one of several out-and-out joke tracks on the controversial star's ninth LP, <em>Double Up</em>, which
    puts his stand-up routine to the fore; against next-level metaphorical ridiculousness like ""Sweet Tooth"", the jeep-sexing ""Ignition (Remix)"" seems Ben Stein-straight.</p><p>
    Hardly a stranger to absurdity, Kells has been studying the art of crazed hilarity for more than a decade. Years before ""Trapped in the Closet"" cast its spell, he was yodeling randomly on ""Get Up on a Room"" and puncturing
    Pavarotti with ""The Opera"", both off of 1998's <em>R.</em> But 21 counts of
    child pornography derailed his ribald candor in 2002, resulting in the spiritually minded <em>Chocolate Factory</em> (2003) and <em>Happy People/U Saved Me </em>(2004). Then people
    started to forget about that tape and R. Kelly started to embrace his flightier
    fancies with force. Now, five years after he was first arrested on those
    infamous charges and with no trial date in sight, <em>Double Up</em> aims for the funny
    bone. Instead of going up against the likes of Dave Chappelle (""Piss on
    U"") and ""Weird Al"" Yankovic (""Trapped in the Drive
    Thru""), Kells attempts to join them-- and top them. 
    </p>
<p>
    In a sense, it seems more apropos to judge <em>Double Up</em> as a
    comedy record than as a pop record. To wit, ""Sex Planet"", with
    its middle school Uranus-isms, is a tad amateur night. Kells
    fares better when he attempts to conflate his ""Closet""-style soap
    opera mastery with his still-peerless way with an r&amp;b hook. Atop a
    featherweight beat on ""Best Friend"", Kelly acts out a nightmare
    scenario where all he can do is worry about his wife's fidelity and bitch about
    toilet paper while holed up in prison due to some vague crime. And though that
    may not sound like much fun on paper, the songwriter uses his keen, Seinfeld-like observational skills to find punchlines in strange places. Plus, the track's underlying sadness gives it a perverted confessional quality.   
    </p>
<p>
    Now 40 and facing a difficult divorce, Kelly sometimes sounds like a man too old for the club but too
    stubborn and horny to turn away. Thankfully, he's somewhat aware of this predicament; the singer mines humor as a hapless rube to Usher's young turk in the love triangle saga
    ""Same Girl"" and a stumbling, regretful drunk on ""Leave Your
    Name"". (What's mid-life-crisis without the R.?) But
    while the album contains enough ""Did ya hear that?!"" couplets to keep even the
    worst Technorati slut stocked with catchphrases for weeks, such one-off bits and scenes lack the repeatability of more traditional pop smashes.
    Luckily, Kells provides a couple of those, too; ""I'm a Flirt""
    (Remix) and ""Hook It Up"" are relatively light on guffaws, but they're
    both equipped with warm, forever-bounce beats that defy gimmicky plot
    twists, age, dubious morality, and shameless fuckaphores.
    </p>
<p>
    When talking about the impetus behind ""Trapped in the
    Closet"" in a November 2005 appearance on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"", Kelly
    said, ""Sometimes you can go through so much that you can't do nothin' but
    laugh."" In 2007, he still faces multiple counts of child pornography
    that could put him in jail for up to 15 years. His daughters, currently ages 9 and 7, will soon be old enough to comprehend
    their father's legal troubles (and his songs). On <em>Double Up</em>'s opening salvo, ""The
    Champ"", he claims, ""I've confessed my sins and still didn't find
    peace."" His moment of reckoning is moving closer, however slowly. But, until then, he's chuckling; comedy, after all, is just tragedy plus time.

    Unless you bought the original LP-only issue of <em>Shortwave Music</em>,
    released on Germany's Raster-Noton in 1997, there's a good chance you've never
    heard Muzak like this. Even then, <em>Shortwave Music</em> wasn't new-- it
    comprises recordings made all the way back in 1982 by William Basinski, during
    an especially prolific phase of musical experimentation that generated an
    archive that sat dormant until the last ten years, when the multimedia artist's
    release schedule has suddenly become quite busy. All of that work involved
    looped sound in one way or another, and this is no exception.</p><p>
    By 1982, Basinski had already created most of the great stockpile of loops
    that have brought him recent acclaim, and seeking a new source of sounds, he
    turned to radio. He sampled short phrases of Muzak and slowed them down until
    they were unrecognizable, drifting ghosts of themselves. The samples were then
    looped at varying lengths and combined two at a time with the crunchy surface
    texture of shortwave broadcasts. The pieces of music that result are tense,
    droning and dissonant to the point that they barely qualify as ambient-- you
    really can't help noticing them (my wife certainly does, and they drive her
    nuts).</p><p>
    If you followed Basinski's releases on Raster-Noton, you've already heard
    the fullest realization of this approach on <em>The River</em>, one of Basinski's
    defining works. If you haven't started listening to him yet, I'd recommend
    hearing that before taking in the five tracks compiled here, as it's the most
    impressive of his shortwave works yet released. This is the experimentation
    that lead him there, and it's for listeners who want a deeper understanding of
    the process and the sound. 
    </p>
<p>
    There are two main points of dynamic tension in the music: the shifting of
    the main musical phrases as two loops of varying length repeat out of sync, and
    the random rise and fall of shortwave static set against the two steady loops.
    The best of the five pieces here (""Particle Showers"" is a bonus track
    not on the original LP) is the 23-minute ""On a Frontier of Wires"",
    which really lets you marinate in the technique. One of the loops is also an
    especially intriguing phrase that sounds like it's searching its way through
    the soup of static and reverb. 
    </p>
<p>
    The other pieces are shorter, though no more direct. ""Evening
    Scars"" is perhaps the most interesting texturally, the way it takes place
    in extremely low registers and is built off of eerie loops that convey an
    underwater feeling. Basinski has carved out an unmistakable sound, and though
    he's walking familiar ground here, it's a beautiful and striking place to
    return to.

    The line between relatable and mundane has been a hard one for rap artists
    to straddle: for every time Del complained about the Oakland public transit
    service on <em>I Wish My Brother George Was Here</em> or Devin the Dude stressed
    about how to stretch $17 on <em>Waitin' to Inhale</em>, there've been countless
    other underground MCs who rhyme about the struggle of their daily lives with
    the same ground-down fatigue that makes their living situation hard to tolerate
    in the first place. They spend so much time talking about their humble
    regular-guy status that they forget to draw an identifiable picture of what
    it's really like to be there -- and often what you're left with is PSA rap,
    something that somberly feeds you information you already know and thinks it's
    important for doing so.</p><p>
    Blue Scholars frequently risk falling into this trap during their sophomore
    full-length <em>Bayani</em>, even if they've got distinctiveness on their side.
    They play up their otherness as a nationally known hip-hop group from Seattle,
    dropping evocative regional references from 1980s Sonics fixture Xavier McDaniel
    to front-line accounts of the World Trade Organization demonstrations, while
    their ethnicity (MC Geologic is Filipino-American; DJ/producer Sabzi is of
    Iranian heritage) stands out as a prospective dialogue-starter in such a
    race-conscious genre. But while there's admirable intent behind their
    working-class solidarity, the album could use a bit more levity and funk for
    fans still riding high off the party-political momentum of last year's
    brilliant Coup album <em>Pick a Bigger Weapon</em>.</p><p>
    That said, you can't lay any significant blame on Geologic's ability as a
    lyricist: while he tends to rest his lyrics' weight on a well-worn brand of
    conscious populism, they're strung together with some worthwhile wordplay and
    frequent flashes of narrative sharpness. The immigrant story in ""The
    Distance"" pivots quickly from idealism to cynicism on a pointed phrase:
    ""But this life was premised on a lie/ Instead of being promised by society
    the nature of economy is sodomy/ Ten generations of property turn to poverty.""
    ""50K Deep"" is a firsthand perspective to the aforementioned WTO
    protests (""I admit, had to split when the first gas canisters hit/ Felt it
    burnin' my nose, eyes and lips"") that brings a personal context to an
    event that's become largely forgotten during the Bush era. And where some
    battle-rap-bred MCs might relate a childhood growing up broke in the 80s
    strictly in pop-culture touchstones and throwaway metaphors, ""Morning of
    America"" ties in Geo's childhood memories of <em>Purple Rain</em>,
    Transformers, and the Cosby Show into the larger, more unsettling era those
    icons were a distraction to -- a time that also saw the Iran-Contra scandal and
    the hate-crime murder of Vincent Chin.
    </p>
<p>
    But the thing that makes <em>Bayani</em> approach tedium is the tone of Geo's
    voice itself, so laser-focused on the words at the expense of inflection that
    it borders on monotony. The chorus of ""Back Home""-- a call to return
    our soldiers back from the front-- demands a certain intensity for it to
    resonate, especially with such straightforward phrasing behind it (""We say
    bring 'em back home/ For my brothers and my sisters who been gone too long/
    Saying bring 'em back home/ And I don't want to have to keep on singing this
    song""). But he sounds more defeated than defiant, as if he just got a look
    at the Democrats' compromised no-timetable Iraq funding bill. It deadens the
    anthemic potential of a few other cuts, too-- ""Fire for the People""
    talks about clenching fists with a tone that couldn't crack a hard-boiled egg,
    and the hitches for breath on ""Still Got Love"" are more noticeable
    than the conflicted bitterness and frustration over ingratitude that should be
    powering it. (The chorus does, however, reveal a decent capacity for half-sung
    cadence.)
    </p>
<p>
    Fortunately, whatever force is lacking in Geologic's voice is largely offset
    by Sabzi's beats. His style is packed with dynamic low-end and clean, glossy
    updates on late-70s/early-80s r&amp;b, drawing on the last ten years' worth of
    East Coast and Midwest neo-soul-rap production with strands of the Roots, the
    Ummah, and Hi-Tek running through. There's lots of odd and unique little
    touches that tend to stick out: a hook that could've been a straightforward
    Bill Withers interpolation is hollowed out into a series of truncated
    syllables; a vocoder bridges the gap between Zapp and fellow Seattleites United
    State of Electronica; a guitar riff is bent so far out of shape it's hard to
    deduce what genre it originated from. Even if the record skews towards the
    mellow and the downtempo, it sounds better each time you play it -- and when that
    happens with production it usually means the rhyming will grow on you. Even if Blue Scholars are conscious rap's next great hope more or less by default, <em>Bayani </em>hints that maybe they aren't as ordinary as they say they are.

    Amid the post-<em>Smile</em> hoopla of 2004, I nervously predicted a Beach Boys backlash. Of course, I'm happy to report I couldn't have been more wrong: Panda Bear's everywhere-praised <em>Person Pitch</em> might be trippier, or the
    Crayon Fields' <em>Animal Bells</em> more
    charming, but <em>Five Roses </em>is as upfront as either about its debt to 2007's oft-name-checked Brian Wilson. Most
    overt is ""Maybe Lately"", which plays off the angelic verse melody of
    ""Don't Worry Baby"" before dissolving into shiny electronics.
    ""And maybe when we're older I'll be less afraid/ And maybe when it gets
    colder you can come to stay,"" Van Pelt sings in a near-falsetto. Layers of
    high-pitched vocal harmonies likewise give a <em>Pet Sounds</em> sound to polished midtempo pop-rockers ""Hold Your
    Secrets to Your Heart"" and ""Have You Seen in Your Dreams""; the sparkling arpeggios on ""Beach Baby"" could almost
    be a slowed-down recreation of the opening guitar chimes of ""Wouldn't It
    Be Nice"". You know, pleasant vibrations.</p><p>
    Miracle Fortress' tracks can sound as much like cybernetic love songs as teenage symphonies, suggesting another influence on Van
    Pelt's studio exercise: fellow texture-lover Brian Eno. Van Pelt's washes of dreamy
    synths and synth-like guitar leads over straight-ahead strums on opener ""Whirrs"" or the atmospheric ""Little Trees"" recall
    the way Eno achieved like-minded combinations during his 70s peak-- though
    without similarly commanding tunes or vocal presence, the comparison isn't entirely complimentary. Moreover, Van Pelt doing Eno is blander than the real dude's best: On songs like cloying ""Blasphemy"", the myriad electronic
    effects barely disguise what's basically lackluster acoustic rock. ""I know
    always we're on different trains/ Sunday meet me, see me here again,"" a
    multi-tracked Van Pelt peeks out from the whirring soundscapes on
    ""Poetaster"".
    </p><p>
<em>Five Roses</em> reveals
    Van Pelt as a talented producer who knows his way around summery pop songs. Still, the album at times indulges Van Pelt's ear for textures a bit much. Miracle Fortress' use
    of traditionally nonmusical sound effects-- cats meowing, birds chirping, or,
    on the title track, a propeller-like whir-- can end up being more memorable than
    the songs such noises adorn. In a perverse move, Van Pelt saves the strongest track,
    ""This Thing About You"", for last; bouncy tambourine and a
    gauze of effects-laden guitars put life into old love-song lyrical tropes. Like Eno, like Wilson,
    Miracle Fortress sounds best when the productions serve the songs.

    Paul McCartney is truly in a class of his own, but not always for the right reasons. The enduring cultural importance of his accomplishments-- and the fact that his private life still moves tabloids in the UK-- affords him a greater stature than your average classic-rock icon. His formidable bank balance suggests that his ongoing recording and performing career is motivated by something more significant than financial gain, but unlike fellow 60s survivors Bob Dylan and Neil Young, McCartney's senior years have not produced an album to challenge the notion that all his best work is decades behind him.</p><p>
    He came close with 2005's mostly acoustic <em>Chaos and Creation in the Backyard</em>, a deliberate and welcome retreat to the homespun simplicity of his 1970 self-titled debut. But while <em>Chaos</em> may have been the best album of his post-Wings career, it still felt a touch too familiar to constitute a <em>Time Out of Mind</em>-style late-career surprise. You have to wonder if McCartney's unwavering dedication to maintaining his cheery, ""cute one"" persona negates the sort of sobering introspection that aging rockers often require to create revelatory, relevant albums in their sixties.</p><p>
    That McCartney's latest album is being released through an exclusive retail agreement with Starbucks only serves to reinforce the most damning stereotypes about him: he's too safe, too typical, too square. And on first song ""Dance Tonight"" <strong>[<a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/43137-paul-mccartney-dance-tonight""><u>video</u></a>]</strong>, he plays right to latte-swilling crowd, with an egregiously innocuous mandolin-folk hootenanny (""Everybody gonna dance tonight/ Everybody gonna feel alright"") custom-built to have his target demographic tapping along on the steering wheels of their Beemers. It's perhaps the least exciting, least arousing song about moving to music since Genesis' ""I Can't Dance"". But as <em>Memory Almost Full</em> plays out, you get the sense that by opening the album with this trifle, McCartney is perhaps intentionally pandering to those stereotypes, and that ""Dance Tonight"" could very well be a sitting-duck decoy for an album that turns out to be a lot more idiosyncratic than its coffee-chain marketing plan suggests.</p><p>
    For one, McCartney isn't just writing love songs here; he's writing sex songs. Take the boudoir-bound white soul of ""See Your Sunshine"", which, if you can forgive the lame mad/sad/glad rhyme scheme, could be the smoothest (read: horniest) thing he's written. And if ""Only Mama Knows"" plays like a standard-issue rocker-- a less fun ""Junior's Farm"", to be exact-- it could be the first song he's written about trolling airport lounges for one-night stands. All of which would suggest that <em>Memory Almost Full</em> is Macca's post-Heather rebound album. As he insisted in last month's <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/42799-interview-sir-paul-mccartney""><u>Pitchfork interview</u></a></strong>, his recent, media-saturated divorce proceedings had no bearing on the songwriting, much of which predates <em>Chaos</em>. However, at this stage in his career, one of the most daring things McCartney could do is show us that even the eternal thumbs-aloft optimist we see hamming it up at photo-ops and awards-show presentations can occasionally crack under the scrutiny. The stress seems to show on the opening line of ""Ever Present Past"" (""I've got too much on my plate/ Ain't got no time to be a decent lover"") but the song turns out to be just another reminiscence for the good ol' days, albeit with a perky new-wave rhythm that's almost novel enough to make you overlook the fact the song lacks a real payoff chorus.</p><p>
    These songs comprise <em>Memory</em>'s patchy first half, betraying the album's piecemeal recording process. But even these unremarkable turns are dotted with interesting production quirks (the tremolo-heavy guitar fuzz on ""Ever Present Past"", the foreboding string sweeps that bookend ""Only Mama Knows"") that suggest a more mischievous spirit lurking behind the pedestrian songwriting. Thankfully, McCartney's oft-overlooked eccentric streak is given freer rein on the album's second half, which feels far more cohesive and substantial thanks to an <em>Abbey Road</em>-like aversion to between-song gaps and an affinity for choir-like vocal effects that momentarily turns the enterprise into a Queen album. In particular, ""Mr. Bellamy"" rates as a worthy addition to his canon of stodgy-English-folk character studies, colored by baroque flourishes, baritone backing vocals and a coda reminiscent of the eerie, dying moments of ""Magical Mystery Tour"". McCartney can be guilty of tripping the light bombastic (see: the squealing guitar solos on overblown power ballad ""House of Wax""), but he also knows when to keep it lean and mean: ""Nod Your Head"" sounds like ""Why Don't We Do It In The Road"" as remixed by Sonic Youth, a blues goof given a palpably more threatening edge by a spark-shower of abrasive feedback textures.</p><p>
    Piano ballad ""The End of the End""-- an uncharacteristically somber meditation on looming death-- is being positioned as <em>Memory</em>'s defining moment, but the obligatory string-section swells and a too-cute whistling solo detract from its affectingly melancholic melody. For a more honest portrait of Macca '07, look to <em>Memory</em>'s best (and loopiest) song, the self-effacing retro-culture commentary ""Vintage Clothes"". The sprightly piano intro initially suggests a rewrite of Fleetwood Mac's ""Say You Love Me"", but its West Coast idyll is soon pushed askew by a skittering dub break and subliminal synth/bass frequencies; top it off with some vintage Wings-style harmonies and you've got a prog-pop triumph just waiting to be to covered by the New Pornographers. Sure, the song's opening salvo (""Don't live in the past"") is a bit rich coming from someone who still makes millions by singing 40-year-old songs in sports arenas. But for the two minutes and 21 seconds it takes for ""Vintage Clothes"" to traverse its shape-shifting universe, the sentiment rings true-- because the song proves that McCartney still knows the difference between just singing about the past and measuring up to it.

<em>Fort Nightly</em> is
    that rare debut where potential isn't the operative word-- White Rabbits deliver the
    whole package straight away. The NYC six-piece writes great songs that merge rhythmic
    intensity with grandiose melodrama in a seamless and inventive package. Opening the album with a
    sinister left-handed piano riff, ""Kid on My Shoulders"" features steam engine drums that give the song's many
    hooks ample chance to sink in. It's a track that keeps getting
    catchier as it goes, ending with a choral coda that has a monumental sweep. Opening
    an album with a headrush like that will be a good strategy from now until
    humans finally wipe themselves out, but plenty of albums peter out after this
    kind of track. <em>Fort Nightly</em> doesn't-- thanks to the band's enormous bag of musical tricks.</p><p>
    The piano, especially the lower
    octaves, is hugely important to a lot of the group's best tracks, though you might not
    realize it at first. It slots well into the band's big, spacious sound, and it
    helps ground the multi-layered vocals and keep the frequently surf-inspired
    guitars at bay. The piano also frequently adds what Duke Ellington once
    referred to as ""the Latin tinge""-- its lead on ""Navy Wives"" provides a tango accent to the song's subtle ska rhythm, one of many tracks that sport a major second-wave ska influence. As far as that's concerned,
    this band is a lot more Specials than Madness, keeping its content mostly dark and
    serious rather than jaunty and jovial.</p><p>
    As important as the piano is, though, the band's biggest
    weapon is the vocals. The leads are strongly melodic, with just a slight
    gravelly edge, and the production puts them front and center without forgetting
    everything else. Around the lead vocals you get everything from doubling that
    simply fortifies the melodies to soft ""ooh-aah"" backing harmonies to weirdness
    like the freakish falsetto choir that pops up twice on of reggae-spiked ""March
    of Camels"", accompanied by a nicely funky staccato piano riff.
    </p>
<p>
    The simple
    doubling on the fractured verses of the title track heightens the uneasy
    atmosphere created by the positively evil piano undertow and chunky march/funk
    drums. The song breaks out of the dark forest with a stately piano melody in
    the middle, only to be sucked back in again.<em> Fort Nightly</em> can
    be appreciated both for its overarching vibe and for minute details such as the very subtle,
    hair-raising organ part that perks up just long enough in the second verse of ""Dinner
    Party"" to shake the song out of its rhythmic comfort zone. It's a great debut
    for a band with an impressive, distinctive sound.

The first record to come out of D.I.Y. as it's defined by this Soul Jazz compilation was also one of the first British punk records: the Buzzcocks' <em>Spiral Scratch</em> EP, represented here by the deathless ""Boredom"". But, of course, D.I.Y. wasn't a movement in the usual sense-- more like the parallel activities of a whole lot of bands who didn't fit in anywhere, and mostly didn't even have much of an affiliation with each other. Luckily for them, punk opened up possibilities for a lot of other kinds of misfit music to find some kind of audience, however small.</p><p>
    The world could use a great one-disc survey of the UK do-it-yourself scene's early years, which the likes of Hyped2Death's Messthetics series have been documenting; unfortunately, this isn't it. For one thing, a definitive D.I.Y. compilation would have to include something by the Desperate Bicycles, who made their own process and ideology the subject of their best single, ""The Medium Was Tedium"". (The Desperate Bicycles have never permitted their music to be officially reissued; you can hear them with a little Googling, though.)</p><p>
    For another, about half of <em>D-I-Y</em> is actually from records released by labels that weren't run by their artists, which muddies the point. It's more like a random sampling from the early years of independent distribution, which makes for more interesting reading than listening. And the album's chronological scope extends from 1977 to Red Lorry Yellow Lorry's 1986 instrumental ""Paint Your Wagon"", whose brittle, doomy crunch doesn't have much of an aesthetic relationship to, say, ""Boredom"". There seem to be a handful of compilations struggling to cut themselves loose from this disc: one of them might be comprised of icy, pasty Brit-funk (A.P.B.'s ""All Your Life With Me"", Glaxo Babies' ""Shake the Foundations"", Biting Tongues' ""You Can Choke Like That""), another devoted to Suicide-inspired electronics and ghostly dub throbs (the Naffis, Russ McDonald, Windows, Thomas Leer, Throbbing Gristle), another filled with poets and comedians who found that music was a better way to get people to pay attention (Artery, Patrick Fitzgerald, the ridiculous pre-Simply Red band Frantic Elevators).</p><p>
    All that would be fine if <em>D-I-Y</em> worked as an album. But it doesn't, really, despite the presence of some extraordinary songs: Swell Maps' buzzbomb ""Let's Build a Car"", Blurt's monomaniacal headbutt ""The Fish Needs a Bike"", Kleenex's joyfully crude ""Ain't You"" (one of only two tracks here with women's voices), Scritti Politti's flutter-crawling dub mutation ""Skank Bloc Bologna"". The presence of the latter two is just a reminder of how much better Rough Trade's long-out-of-print <em>Wanna Buy a Bridge?</em> compilation, on which they both appear, documented the musical and historical moment this hints at. Everything on both that record and <em>D-I-Y</em> has its jagged edges, but <em>Bridge</em> fit them together into an improbable, luminous mosaic. This collection is just a pile of broken glass with some beautiful shards in it. </p></div>"|10275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10275-d-i-y-do-it-yourself/|5.9|Douglas Wolk

    Like most of the Anticon roster he's helped curate, Tim
    Holland, aka Sole, is a rapper-as-slam-poet, purposefully eschewing hip-hop
    iconogrphy in lieu of abstruse, intellectualized streams-of-consciousness over
    cold, unforgiving beats. Alongside fellow Anticon artists and former tourmates,
    Holland's website links to a Noam Chomsky torrent site and a database for
    vegetarian recipes, echoing his persona as a loquacious lefty, with equal
    tendencies toward introspection and anti-capitalism. Holland's keen eye toward
    self-branding, however, led to the Mansbestfriend series, on which he allows
    himself a high degree of experimental latitude, free of the burden of his more
    established moniker. On <em>Poly.sci.187</em>, Holland takes what some might see
    as <em>too</em> large a step into new territory, however. He completely excises
    his own lyrics, substituting archival digital audio clips of religious
    conservatives, popular culture oddities, and political dissidents-- thus
    emerging, more or less, as a DJ Shadow for the Huffington Post set.</p><p>
<em>Poly.sci</em> came into being while Holland was
    touring Europe, a location doubly important for its geographic and ideological
    remove from the right-wing American political atmosphere. Fittingly, then, the
    record opens with ""Dedemma Speaks"", a bit of biographical role-play on
    which exiled early 20th century anarchist Emma Goldman is heard to say ""I
    will leave the country rather than deny my ideas."" An ominous, <em>Endtroducing</em>-style
    tableau underscores ""The Teachings of Leviticus"", over which a
    distorted female voice, culled from archive.org, recites bizarre anachronisms
    from the most politicized of Bible books, including: ""If a man has sexual
    relations with an animal, he must be put to death. He must also kill the
    animal."" That the quote is not too dissimilar from something former
    Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum actually said publicly is the song's most
    distressing element.</p><p>
    Later, ""Spin the Humans"" begins with the
    voice of a young boy, snatched from YouTube, advocating for peace in Lebanon,
    then giving way to <em>Poly.sci</em>'s best instrumental moment, an insistent,
    darkly rhythmic Middle Eastern groove. The title of ""Humans"" is
    clarified at the song's end, when Holland abruptly cuts in audio from an
    episode of ""Wheel of Fortune"" taped in the New Orleans Superdome,
    complete with over-excited, whooping American college students eagerly awaiting
    cash and prizes. As an attempted political manifesto, the jarring transition
    could certainly be regarded as binaristic, but it's also thought provoking and
    entertaining, which counts nearly as much with the milieu is Web 2.0 musique
    concrète.
    </p>
<p>
    Holland devotes as much time for less political
    instrumental excursions as well, and with a good degree of success.
    ""Wilting Onward"", which he describes in the liner notes as emerging
    from ""a time period when I had basically gotten sick of the sound of my
    own voice and everything I have to say,"" surrounds a plaintive female
    vocal sample with menacing drums and increasing layers of fuzz, before segueing
    nicely into the dissonant, string-laden ambience of ""High Noon and
    Sobered"". ""Allieverwanted"" and ""Stuck in My Head Since I
    Was 12"" return to the old-school rap on which Holland was weaned, and
    late-album highlight ""Missile Defense"" is tumultuous drum-and-bass
    shoegaze.
    </p>
<p>
    The Mansbestfriend series was inaugurated when Holland
    realized the potential of wholly computerized modes of production, and acquired
    its title from the nickname he gave his Mac G4. While <em>Poly.sci</em> might
    risk alienating the fervent fanbase he's built through his <em>sui generis</em>
    flow, it's still the most complete realization of his original impulse. More
    importantly, though, and to Holland's credit as a producer, <em>Poly.sci</em>
    proves that he can remove his signature musical element and still create a
    record that pushes many of the same affective buttons while moving out in
    unconventional directions. Rappers like Sole-- strident, politically and
    tech-savvy, Caucasian-- do share one linguistic affinity with the progressive
    activists they often strive to emulate: they often overspeak the boundaries of
    their chosen medium. The rap idiom, like the news media, operates most efficiently when
    filled with short, cadenced blurbs of sound; in this sort of environment, more
    potent messages can be delivered when the speaker himself pipes down and lets
    others do the talking.

    that it's not going to be another <em>Summerteeth</em>-- still the band's most successful attempt at casting their country-rock
    rusticity in a gilded, big-production glow. That it's Wilco's second
    lowest-selling record (after debut <em>AM</em>) may put me in the minority, but after
    spending a few lazy Sundays with the debut EP by Illinois, I'm pretty sure
    these guys can relate. They may hail from small-town Pennsylvania and have a
    banjo player as a frontman, but Illinois' stock trade is roots-rock
    uprooted: Dust Bowl balladry that's been yanked out of the soil and set free
    to float away.</p><p>
    If Illinois don't add anything new to the indie rock conversation, they are
    clearly well-versed in the proper lingo: this seven-song EP hurtles skyward
    on a billowy bed of ""ba da ba ba bas,"" those onomonopoetic endearments that
    softened up a million Pavement and Yo La Tengo songs. Illinois are decidedly
    less obtuse in their emotional expressions: That the chorus to opener ""Alone
    Again"" repeats the phrase ""I'm alone again"" pretty much sums it up. But even
    Illinois' most downcast songs possess a heady grandeur that serves to leaven
    their simplistic, sad-sack sentiments, particularly on splendorous piano-pop
    serenade ""What Can I Do For You"", whose dejected disposition (""So this is
    goodbye/ I miss that look in your eye"") is remedied by a swooning chorus and
    a tasteful banjo break that's more affective than decorative in function.</p><p>
    What's most impressive about Illinois at this early stage is their ability
    to indulge in lovelorn lyricism and cosmic-cowboy reveries while honoring
    pop music's premium on levity and brevity (the longest song here clocks in
    at 3:14). And besides, it's not all tears-in-beers here: ""Screendoor"" is 128
    seconds of acoustic-strummed rolling rock and call-and-response ""ooh ooh
    ooh"" elation, and the uncharacteristic hayseed funk of ""Nosebleed"" offers a
    quaint reminder of that fleeting period in the mid-90s when anyone
    associated with Beck got an instant deal with DGC and the Flaming Lips hit
    the top 40. The latter song's quirks-- distorted megaphoned vocals,
    compressed drum beats-- reappear in much less satisfying form on the
    concluding spoken-word ramble ""Bad Day"", which feels more like a B-side toss
    off than a closing statement, and suggests Illinois will need more than just
    a few banjo plucks to establish their own singular personality. Still, amid
    the grand lineage of bands named after states, I'll take 'em over
    Texas or Kansas.</p></div>"|10262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10262-what-the-hell-do-i-know-ep/|6.8|Stuart Berman

For their first full-length album on Ecstatic Peace, the collective typically (formerly?) known as Sunburned Hand of the Man have scaled back to become simply the Sunburned, and they have streamlined their sound as well, evidently in quest of an express route to extra-dimensional nirvana. Gone-- for the most part-- are the expansive tribal jams and creaky backwoods funk that characterized such top-notch Sunburned releases as <i>Headdress</i> or <i>No Magic Man</i>, replaced instead by a far more conventional noise-rock strategy.</p>
<p>Regardless of what name they're traveling under, the Sunburned have continued to produce and release so many recordings that it becomes difficult to make any grand, sweeping announcements about any one individual album. But suffice it to say that <i>Z </i>definitely ranks among the heaviest and most No Wave-influenced artifacts in their prodigious catalog. As with many a noise act before them, John Moloney and company here seem to retreat to the squalling riff destruction of the Dead C or early Sonic Youth almost as if reverting to their natural default setting. And though the work they capture in this feral state makes for some fine bottle-smashing entertainment and plenty of ephemeral thrills and spills, <i>Z</i> remains one of the group's least distinctive releases to date and is so unlikely to reach ""go-to"" status in your already teetering Sunburned stack.</p>
<p>Moloney has described <i>Z</i> as being an acknowledgment of ""infinity and the double dimension we all live in but don't fully understand."" With that in mind Sunburned have here designated each of the album's five tracks with an ascending number of infinity symbols. The first of these pieces commences with a brief snatch from one of the group's familiar pan-ethnic rituals, before suddenly dropping out-- with no further preamble-- into a maelstrom of distended noise. Beneath thick curtains of soaring feedback and amp distortion, Sunburned's elastic rhythm section rolls and roils through the album's first two tracks in continuous free-rock turmoil, their ramshackle psych-rock grooves recalling Acid Mothers Temple at their most fried.</p>
<p>Sunburned pause for a brief gulp of brown oxygen on the album's third track, on which some of the collective's latent Butthole Surfers tendencies are allowed room to fester. As Moloney gibbers with an incoherent ecstasy, the guitars scribble mysterious figures on the cave walls as landmarks for future pilgrims. So rejuvenated, the collective is then ready to address the album's final two mammoth improvisations (that would be ""four infinity symbols"" and ""five infinity symbols""). On these long-winded tracks the group's sound mutates into increasingly unrecognizable forms, their squiggly blasts of analog electronics nodding more to Wolf Eyes and their disorienting ilk than to the group's own past wide-open cooperative ceremonies. As <i>Z</i> screeches to a close with the sound of a solo human voice electronically dilating into oblivion, perhaps the Sunburned are suggesting that in the face of such infinity, each of us must ultimately approach alone. Hopefully, however, this album does not indicate that on their path forward, SHotM will feel the further need to shed or otherwise abandon the potent communal narcosis that has carried them this far.</p></div>"|10268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10268-z/|5.8|Matthew Murphy

    For a live album to make sense, it needs to document a moment worth remembering. The recent tread toward ""instant live"" records epitomized the live album as concert memento, delivering freshly burned CDs into the hands of eager concertgoers mere minutes after a show's end.  Other live artifacts seek to preserve a crucial moment in the performer's career, frozen in time (hopefully) with one's energy and excitement intact.  This just-released document of a three-year-old Guided by Voices show-- part of New West's extensive <em>Live From Austin, TX</em> series-- is the concert album at its most mundane and frustrating, showcasing a perfectly fine performance by a very good band and nothing more.</p><p>
    Guided by Voices never released a truly seminal live record, though the career-spanning live performances compiled as <em>Live at the Wheelchair Races</em> from the <em>Hardcore UFOs</em> box set come close. For the most part, GBV's extensive concert bootlegs are best described by phrases beginning ""the one where"" (i.e., ""have you heard the one where Bob gets drunk and asks whose dick he's gonna have to suck to hear something in the monitors?""). Sadly, this new 2xCD concert document seems like an average night out for late-era Guided by Voices. Making matters worse is the fact that the band's big live finale was already released in the form of the <em>Electrifying Conclusion</em> DVD.  Two-and-a-half years after the band's breakup, <em>Live From Austin</em> evokes none of the poignancy of the band's beginning, middle, or end.</p><p>
    The performances on <em>Live From Austin</em> are unerringly solid, and the setlist is characteristically thorough.  The sound quality is not bad for a live show, though Bob Pollard's vocals tend to overpower everything else in the mix.  As is often the case with live GBV recordings, the banter often outshines the music, starting when Pollard interrupts the crowd's chant of ""G! B! V!"" with ""sing it!  Learn it!  Know it!"" and then introduces ""Demons are Real"" slurred to sound kind of like 
    ""Stevens are Real"".</p><p>
    Highlights from the set include early favorite ""Pendulum"", ""Everybody Thinks I'm a Raincloud (When I'm Not Looking)"" from the band's final album <em>Half-Smiles of the Decomposed</em>, and all the usual mid-period ""hits,"" played no better and no worse than usual.  Pollard's trademark oddball sloppiness, coupled with the workmanlike<br/>
    proficiency of his bandmates, does not necessarily make for an engaging long-term listening experience. If you've seen or heard a live GBV show from the group's final 10 or so years, you probably have a pretty good idea of how these songs are performed-- tight, energetic, entertaining, but often lacking the ineffable magic of the band's best work.</p></div>"|10281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10281-live-from-austin-tx/|4.5|Matt LeMay

    For years it seems Wheat fans have fallen into two camps. On one hand there are those who prefer the band's second album, 1999's <em>Hope &amp; Adams</em>, which featured pop music sharply refined to its sleekest, simplest assemblage of elements: a riff, a verse, a chorus, a fade, not necessarily in that order. Minimalist to a fault, <em>Hope &amp; Adams</em> sounded like it was made to be shed immediately: Its appeal continues to lie in its embrace of the ephemeral as transcendence. Then there are those who prefer Wheat's 2001 major-label debut<em> Per Second Per Second Per Second...Every Second</em>, which refines Scott Levesque's songwriting and finds him organizing his ideas within more traditional song structures. The result is a power-pop album that's more memorable than its predecessor-- but in this case, that's a neutral adjective. To fans of <em>Hope &amp; Adams</em>, <em>Per Second</em> sounds too polished and radio-friendly, as if the band (or their label) were smoothing over their eccentricities for a spot on the <em>Elizabethtown</em> soundtrack, but to fans of <em>Per Second</em>, <em>Hope &amp; Adams</em> sounds hopelessly obtuse, wasting its potential hooks on songs that seemed unfinished.</p><p>
    Ostensibly, Wheat's fourth album, <em>Everyday I Said a Prayer for Kathy and Made a One Inch Square</em>, attempts to reconcile these two factions by giving musical weight to Levesque's songs while avoiding obvious pop structures. In doing so, however, it has the potential to alienate both camps: Toying with sound and rhythm, noise and melody, <em>Square</em> is less minimalist than <em>Hope</em>, more fractured than <em>Second</em>. It's the band's first record in nearly four years, during which time they were dropped from their label and long-time member Ricky Brennan departed. But <em>Square</em> is not a return to form, mainly because Wheat have never really had a set form to begin with.</p><p>
    The songs on <em>Square</em> follow their own logic, as if Wheat are trying to make them move nonlinearly. After a burst of synth noise, opener ""Closeness"" sets up a wordy chorus that eventually gives way to a passage of ahooooo's that goes on about twice as long as you'd expect before returning to the main melody. ""Little White Dove"" ends with a lengthy coda that layers Levesque's vocals in a round with Brendan Harney's rolling snare. These songs always promise some sort of pop pay-off-- a supremely catchy hook, a buoyant riff, a momentous push-- but make a point of rarely delivering on it. Sometimes this tendency can be frustrating and even a little disingenuous on the band's part, as if Levesque and Harney are consciously holding back. As a result, <em>Square</em> sounds like an album lacking verses and choruses and comprised entirely of bridges. 
    </p>
<p>
    But Levesque and Harney aren't subverting listener expectations so much as they are ignoring them altogether, so the album's disjointedness, mostly comes across as playful, allowing each passage to stand on its own: the guitar fanfare on ""Init. 005 (Formerly, a Case of...)"", the high-hat-heavy beat on ""I Had Angels Watching Over Me"", the spoken insistences on ""An Exhausted Fixer"", the crack in Levesque's voice as he tries to hit the high notes on ""Saint in Law"". In a sense, these moments exist independently from one another, like the one-inch squares for Kathy that fill up the package design. By the middle of the album, the songs have grown almost collagistic, especially the pairing of ""Init. 005 (Formerly, a Case of...)"" and ""Saint in Law"", but they are merely an intermission before the reinvigorated rush of ""What You Got"" picks up the frayed pop threads again and carries it through to the instrumental closer ""Courting Ed Templeton"".
    </p>
<p>
    Weaving through these moments is a larger story of loss, grief, and recovery, as if a single tragic event has inspired this album. Levesque constantly hints at it by flirting with lyrical cliché. The chorus of ""Move=Move"" seems to crib from Sting-- ""the things u love should be set free""-- but Levesque tempers it with a dose of realism-- ""The things u love can get off track/ Because everything don't come back."" On ""I Had Angels Watching Over Me"", the Hallmark-friendly title forms the basis of an uneasy conversation: ""I recall a friend said, I had angels watching over me/ I thought that they were making fun of me."" Levesque's dryly self-deprecating delivery makes the line register as a humbling joke. Fortunately, that story remains just under the surface throughout <em>Square</em>, where you can make out its shape but not its specifics. It's enough to give weight and direction to what otherwise might simply seem like separate one-inch squares of music.

    There is no more delicious experience as a music critic than being accused of sexism. It's a delight to hear via e-mail how your opinion on one particular album by one particular artist can be extrapolated to a worldview that favors the marginalization and stereotyping of an entire gender. This despite all my best efforts to avoid the common pitfalls of a community that continues to be dominated by male voices: no sexualized descriptors like ""chanteuse"" or condescending adjectives like ""cute,"" no allegations that there is a male Svengali behind the curtain, no commentary on how attractive (or un-) I find the artist in question.</p><p>
    Yet all the same, I still feel pangs of guilt when I look at my music library and see the men outnumbering the women by a healthy margin. It's better than it once was, and two of my last three year-end favorites were bands with female singers, but the disparity remains undeniable, an easily interpretable manifestation of my personal taste. It doesn't help matters that recent indie rock trending, particularly the rise of coffee-shop folk, has pushed a lot of female artists in a rather dreary direction; in other words, there are a lot more Cat Powers these days than Sleater-Kinneys.</p><p>
    Not that there's anything wrong with Chan Marshall, though her sparse and moody sound can very easily become too slick or too dilute in the wrong hands. Shannon Wright lives dangerously on this border throughout <em>Let in the Light</em>, sticking close to the usual guitar and piano-centric formulas and singing in a distinct but familiar low, raspy alto. The production skews twilight, the arrangements tend to be solo, and her lyrics bend towards the poetic and the metaphorical, with a couple maybe/maybe-not Dylan references thrown in for good measure. All par for the singer-songwriter course.
    </p>
<p>
    Wright also drifts back and forth on the casual vs. formal axis, some tracks (""Defy This Love"", ""Steadfast and True"") built on recital-proper piano parts, while others (""When the Light Shone Down"", ""In the Morning"") shamble along at a sleepy pace and leave the edges rough. The fancier piano numbers are more unique, but also more restrictive: Wright composes pretty instrumental melodies with a classical flourish one rarely hears from a rock artist on ivory keys, but their complexity leaves little space for her voice to navigate, even in solo arrangements. With the guitar, the opposite tends to be true, as Wright's deliberate and mellow style calls out for some caffeine and mimes <em>Girlysound</em>-era Liz Phair a bit too closely.
    </p>
<p>
    The coffee theory is borne out by the more strident tracks, which tend to be album highlights, especially in contrast to the majority melancholy. ""St. Pete"" is built on Wright's most jagged guitar part, and requires her to go beyond her currently-preferred whisper to a slightly snotty bellow more in line with her earlier full-band sound. That welcome snarl comes back on the choruses of ""Don't You Doubt Me"", where an unleashed drummer and two off-kilter guitars lend the tune a discomforting urgency, and the album-closing ""Everybody's Got Their Own Part to Play"", a triumphant piano-rock epic with an acidic underbelly. 
    </p>
<p>
    These flashes of menace amidst the hazier surroundings make me wish they were more frequent, that Wright still favored the toothier approach of her previous records. It's these harsher moments that separate her from the indie female singer-songwriter pack, a clique that seems increasingly drawn into the dreary hypnosis of heavy atmosphere and somnambulant tempo. Ah, but perhaps I shouldn't generalize.

And it's true that a minor-key, Dischord-inspired edge balanced out their emotional evangelism. Nevertheless, in almost every Engine Down song, there came a point when Keeley Davis would launch into a rafter-shaking blare that was related to the guitars churning below it only by key. At these moments, you had to contend with the uncomfortable realization that you <i>were </i>listening to emo-- nth wave, suburban, mall-friendly emo.</p>
<p>No one knows how Denali fans regarded Denali, because no one has ever met one. This isn't meant to be as snarky as it sounds-- in fact, Denali were pretty good. Maura Davis' pipes were even more imposing than her brother's (one imagines Richmond homeowners taping up their windows against high-decibel shattering when the Davis family went Christmas caroling), and Denali had a more nuanced style than Engine Down-- slinky and glacial, it was a sort of electrified lounge-noir. But Denali were that archetypal band that lacked memorable songwriting to bolster their cool sound. They were easy to like, but too compositionally effaced to love.</p>
<p>After the demise of both bands, the Davis siblings reunited (with talented Engine Down drummer Cornbread Compton) as the power trio Glös, and their debut scans as a mature corrective to their juvenile excesses. This would explain any number of decisions on <i>Harmonium</i> that would seem to play against their established strengths. If you've spent your musical career recording vocals that absolutely crush everything else in the mix, then on your mature album, you might decide to filter them so heavily that they sound recorded via long-distance call. If both of your singers are known for scenery-chewing crescendos, then you might keep them low in the mix, seldom breaking free from their dusky minuet. And if you're smart, then you might retain the more winning characteristics of each band-- in this case, Engine Down's syncopated thrust and Denali's stripped-down smolder-- to create lean, sinewy dirge-pop of unexpected sophistication.</p>
<p>If this approach sounds formulaic, it can be, and some songs on <i>Harmonium</i> seem to overcompensate for their creators' prior intemperance. These suffer from the Denali-syndrome: They sound good, but are difficult to distinguish from one another. The album opens with ""Unharmed""-- a reversed guitar figure launches a gritty, minor-key scrape contrasted by floating trebles, then collapses into a slashing grind that's somehow heavy and buoyant at once. The sound is enticing and specific to Glös, but plays out predictably over the next few tracks, which, while pinioned by crisp dynamic shifts, run together in a shadowy, glittering blur.</p>
<p>This isn't true of the album's midsection, which profits greatly from a bit of stylistic variation. ""Telepathy"" uses a runaway jangle, elastic bass, and damaged guitar flourishes to drive home its potent vocal line, and ""Tainted"" is an album-stealing standout that crackles like a live wire, mostly because the Davis siblings capitalize upon the harmonic possibilities of their dual vocal prowess rather than tip-toeing around them. Singing two different vocal lines that tangle and then surge together amid thunderous percussion, their new sound comes into full flower, and the slight vocoder accents on Keeley's voice are surprisingly effective. Glös is already a more captivating idea than Engine Down or Denali, and they should only improve as they put more distance between themselves and those towering shadows.</p></div>"|10265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10265-harmonium/|6.6|Brian Howe

Smith had lent his signature talky vocals to two remixes of Mouse on Mars' ""Wipe That Sound"" for a 12-inch. His pinched rants ripped apart the sugary pop     buzz that Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma had conjured on the MES-free original version, which had appeared a few months earlier on the duo's <i>Radical Connector</i> LP. They'd taken all that time to assemble dense tracks and memorable hooks, and     Smith sounded like he'd just stumbled in off the street to grouchily announce whatever random thoughts happened to pop     into his head. Though Mouse on Mars had been enjoying a bump in popularity     at the time, owing to their recent turn to pop, no one seemed to pay much attention to     that single. It seemed reasonable to write it off as a joyless dead-end     experiment and nothing more.</p>
<p>So it comes as something of a surprise now that Mouse on Mars     and Smith apparently found the one-off inspiring enough to record an entire     album together. <i>Tromatic Reflexxions</i>, their (first?) full-length, reflects the general tenor of that original collaboration, even featuring one of the ""Wipe That Sound"" remixes in a slightly different form, and retitled ""That Sound Wiped"". Somehow, even though ""That Sound Wiped"" sounds just OK, the     ideas presented actually gain some cumulative force as they're hammered at again and again over 48 minutes. In this way, the record operates something like a Fall album, wearing you down with its relentless energy.</p>
<p>Some have noted that Von Südenfed occasionally sounds like Smith is knocking     back at the early LCD Soundsystem singles, on which he'd been such a clear influence, and opening track     ""Can't Get Enough"" is probably the reason for the comparison. St. Werner     and Toma have crafted a crunchy, bouncy beat with a bassline not terribly far     from ""Losing My Edge"", and of course, Smith carries on like the     scenester-baiting O.G. that he is. It's a solid kickoff that also lays out     the project's tight parameters: Its grooves are harsh and noisy,     often stuttering about in strange ways, and they strike a strong contrast to the accessible pop tendencies of Mouse on Mars' clubbier recent material. Meanwhile, Smith's voice is     slathered in reverb, EQ'd to give it     midrange-only bite, and occasionally chopped into bits and inserted where its     abrasion can be best felt-- the sonic equivalent of a pebble in a shoe.</p>
<p>The first eight songs stick closely to this template with slight variations,     like a catchy chorus hook (""The Rhinohead"") or a ridiculously broken     beat that seems to bypass your hearing entirely and head straight for the     fragile equilibrium maintained by your inner ear (""Serious     Brainskin""). It's a weird stretch of music, sometimes exciting, but also     oddly monotonous-- especially considering the tightly packed and maximal     approach to sound-- and ultimately a little draining.</p>
<p>They finally decide to mix things up a bit during the album's last quarter. ""Chicken     Yiamas"" begins with acoustic guitars playing some mutant blues. Smith says something about a yardbird and how he has two bones, but there must be     something about those drumsticks because he ululates wildly, sounding more     energized than at any other moment on the record. ""Jback Lois     Lane"" is mostly just a goof, a field recording dominated by a lawnmower as     Smith speaks to someone only partly coherently in the middle distance. This     leads to a bubbling tune with a vaguely West African guitar line and plenty of slide. Smith sounds like he's having a lot of fun by now, and his rhythmic feel     is completely on as he negotiates the groove with strategically elongated     vowels. How did we get here? What does this all add up to? Hard to say. <i>Tromatic     Reflexxions</i> sounds like three guys having a great time ignoring whoever     might be asking these questions.</p></div>"|10279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10279-tromatic-reflexxions/|7.0|Mark Richardson

    Like it or not, a lot of today's mainstream rock acts are resurrecting the lost art of the concept album to surprising degrees of success. While old staples like Nine Inch Nails or Red Hot Chili Peppers spiced up their recent twilight albums with the respective themes of apocalypse and love-via-music, newer groups have embraced the concept album to the point of self-reinvention. Take My Chemical Romance-- whose <em>Welcome to the Black Parade</em> LP's affinity for Queen-sized riffs and glam-rock pomp raised many elitists' eyebrows-- making Top 40 music more intriguing for an indie contingent long nauseated by the Linkin Parks and Nickelbacks of the world.</p><p>
    Then there's the Killers, the synth-rock monoliths inexorably linked to Brooklyn parasites the Bravery. Although <em>Hot Fuss</em> served as the nefarious stem cell to the seemingly hundreds of new wave/post-punk revivalist clones-- the Bravery included-- Brandon Flowers &amp; co. risked alienating their fanbase by swapping 80s icons on <em>Sam's Town</em>, replacing airy Duran Duran electro-pop with stone-washed Bruce Springsteen ethos. No matter how many prefabricated altercations Flowers and Bravery frontman Sam Endicott want to engage in, the latter can't deny his debt to the former: The Bravery's self-titled debut flourished in the new-wave niche carved out by the Killers. Unsurprisingly, the band now appears at a loss for a next move on their follow-up, <em>The Sun and the Moon</em>, jilted by a dance-rock scene that's grown less and less forgiving with every soulless, four-on-the-floor wannabe anthem.</p><p>
    To understand what a failure of a record this is, you have to consider the few redeeming qualities of the band's self-titled debut. Despite its shameless Cure copping, ""An Honest Mistake"" left open the possibility of the band becoming a jaded, Americanized Franz Ferdinand, while ""Fearless"" and ""No Brakes"" flashed subtler, smarter synth and basslines than nearly anything on <em>Hot Fuss</em>. However, seeking to now eschew their blatant touchstones, the band strips down to a more guitar-based mush not beholden to any one or two specific influences, but remains shockingly unoriginal nonetheless.</p><p>
    Modern rock fixture Brendan O'Brien mans the boards here, spackling the band's sound with as much fluff and plastic as his early 90s records had grunge and feedback. First single ""Time Won't Let Me Go"" candy-coats Endicott's slit-wrist pathos, wrapping sunny organs and Coldplay-style reverb riffs around the frontman as he bitches about how dreary life was before he became a fabulous rock star: ""I never had a summer of '69/ Never had a Cherry Valance of my own/ All these precious moments you promised me would come in time.""</p><p>
    As annoying as Endicott's mascara-tainted bellyaching was on the Bravery's debut, his histrionics-for-the-masses commandeer the group's stylistic direction on <em>The Sun and the Moon</em>, cheapening already trite regurgitations of Robert Smith confessionals by bloating them to anthemic proportions. ""Every Word Is a Knife in My Ear"", an utterly unsexy, castrated version of ""Take Me Out"", wouldn't even be plausible as a sticker on a goth teenager's bookbag-- let alone as a relatable relationship grievance. Even worse, ""Tragedy Bound""-- the album's stab at a tearjerking, showstopping acoustic ballad amidst a barrage of smug one-liners and putdowns-- follows the traditional Britpop formula for lamenting female depravity, right down to Endicott occasionally lapsing into a mopey British accent.</p><p>
    There was a time when the most desperate of <em>NME</em> apostles could argue that the Bravery had simply been victims of indie elitists' version of McCarthyism. After all, Razorlight, the Killers, and any number of other hacks hailed as part of a dance-rock revolution by the notorious British tabloid had heated purists' blood to a boiling point, practically guaranteeing the Bravery as DOA when their debut hit. However, <em>The Sun and the Moon</em>-- an album content to find hooks with the least resistance, to place the last 10 years of indie rock in a blender, and try to foist that gruel as something novel, to offend the very art of rock'n'roll-- vindicates even those extremists who practically urged to blacklist this band. Have you <em>no sense of decency</em>, Bravery?

    Vapnet occupy a space somewhere between Swedish dance and
    Swedish pop, favoring the motion of the former and the bright melodies of the
    latter. Perhaps there's nothing intrinsically original or even noteworthy about
    that combination, but the band-- which includes Martin Abrahamsson, Martin
    Hanberg, Anna Modin, and David Nygård-- puts a personal stamp on its music. Vapnet favor open-ended song structures that
    permit long instrumental passages and unexpected melodic twists, even though
    Abrahamsson and Hanberg typically write traditional verse-chorus patterns. In
    2006, when Sweden seemed to produce great acts on a weekly basis, Vapnet's
    dense production and inventive arrangements made their full-length debut, <em>Jag Vet Hur Man Väntar</em>,
    a stand-out, one whose concept-- each song was named after a street in their
    hometown of Östersund (thanks to reader Fredrik for that info)-- helped to frame
    the music without constraining it.</p><p>
<em>Något Dål</em><em>igt Nytt Har
    Hänt</em>, their EP-length follow-up, isn't an epilogue to that album, but an
    expansion of its sound. Vapnet have obviously spent a lot of time in the studio
    since <em>Jag Vet Hur
    Man Väntar</em>, laboring over these new tracks and ambitiously filling
    each one with as many ideas as they'll hold. Fussiness becomes them: The music
    is polished without sounding slick, busy without sounding overloaded, and cerebral
    but warm. All those sonic details add up to a compelling, often exciting whole:
    On ""Släpa Hem Mig"", each softly percussive tone has been painstakingly sculpted
    to shift the accent from beat to beat. Opener ""Tjernobyl"" falls away for a few
    seconds of abrupt silence before its final verse-- it's both a dramatic pause
    and an intake of breath before the rush of melody.</p><p>
    These studio elements mingle easily with the band's live
    instrumentation, striking a fine balance. Every track on <em>Något dål</em><em>igt Nytt Har
    Hänt</em> has its own signature instrument: Modin's
    flute plays a soft, simple theme on ""Tjernobyl"" that blossoms into something
    large and almost transcendent by song's end, and on ""Häll ihop"", Jens Lekman's
    baritone mingles with Per-Olof Stjernered's reedy saxophone over a subtle bossa
    nova-inflected beat. Abrahamsson's melodica glides across the shuffling dance
    rhythms of ""Tar Tillbaka Det"", shedding all of the instrument's connections
    with Damon Albarn. On ""Mera Om Varandra"", a choir of voices joins Hanberg on
    the final chorus, as if the EP has been secretly building to that moment all
    along, while Nygård's trombone provides a poignant denouement on the brief
    closer ""Tjernobyl (Repris)"".

    But nothing is as it seems with Vapnet. The band's name
    means <em>weapon</em>, yet their music sounds
    too upbeat and unabashedly enthusiastic to be threatening. The title <em>Något Dål</em><em>igt Nytt Har
    Hänt</em> even
    translates (roughly) to <em>Something new bad has happened,</em> but the songs betray no sense of doom, at least not musically.
    In fact, the obvious joy these musicians take in crafting such sophisticated,
    surprising songs has made them one of the most interesting bands in Sweden--
    or anywhere else for that matter.

    Like Andrew Bird and Final Fantasy, Amanda Kapousouz can
    turn a stringed instrument into a full band. An Athens-based musician who also
    performs Celtic-tinged acoustic folk under her own name, she plays a number of
    instruments on <em>Liar and the Thief</em>,
    her debut as Tin Cup Prophette (which was released locally in early 2006 and
    is now getting a wider push), but the primary element on all her songs is
    the violin, which she loops and manipulates into a versatile range of sounds
    that coalesce into dark melodies and exotic rhythms. As it is for her
    male counterparts, this concept is a freeing innovation that allows Kapousouz to test
    the limits of her instrument and exert greater control over her music. In execution, however, Kapousouz-- who collaborated with Daniel
    Rickard of Parker and Lilly-- distinguishes herself from her loopy peers by
    eschewing both indie rock and art pop to mold her langorous strings into sharp
    beats and tense, decidedly urban mood music.</p><p>
    Kapousouz's approach works best on ""Going Numb"", which
    begins with nervous plucks that form an unsettling staccato rhythm. Then come
    the Mike Oldfield-style bells, still suggesting otherworldly menace even nearly 35
    years after <em>The Exorcist</em>, followed by
    a bassline and strings that have been manipulated to saturate the low end. Over
    this carefully textured backdrop, Kapousouz sings about her body emptying
    itself out, her voice sounding simultaneously desperate and distant, as if
    inhabiting some middle plane. The instruments each fall away, only to build
    back up for a dramatic push on the chorus. Overall, it's the most effective
    showcase for Kapousouz's loops and vocals and easily the most fully realized
    track on the album.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, every other song on <em>Liar and the Thief</em> inhabits the same cramped, forbidding space as
    ""Going Numb"", but fails to capture the song's expertly calibrated dynamic. There
    are highs, of course: On the title track and ""80 Days"", her plucks and staccato
    bows coalesce into strict military beats, and elsewhere, longer notes add
    background dissonance, adding to the somber tension. With its low guitar and
    almost chirpy bells, ""Poster"" is a down-key song that places Kapousouz's
    layered vocals in an almost-live setting. 
    </p>
<p>
    But there are also many lows. As studiously experimental as
    her music is, Kapousouz's songs are uniformly, almost monotonously somber, with
    trip-hop beats that recall Sneaker Pimps more than Portishead. Those rigorously
    thudding rhythms create strictly regimented tempos that rarely change within or
    among the songs, and as a result, she has very little opportunity to alter her
    vocal delivery, as if she's stuck on tortured setting. As a result, her songs
    hit the same pained marks over and over, eventually blurring together into a
    slightly amorphous whole. Too carefully textured to be demos, the songs nevertheless
    sound like first stabs at a promising project.

    gold rush. Major-label debut <em>Don't Bring
    Me Down </em>came out to polite Coldplay comparisons in 2002, but that must not
    have been enough for EMI/Virgin. Subsequent releases, including 2003's <em>Extended Play </em>EP and their David
    Fridmann-assisted 2005 sophomore album <em>Ozona</em>,
    have trickled out on indie labels. Disappointingly, Goldrush's third proper full-length <em>The Heart Is the Place</em> sounds like the work of a band
    still rehearsing for Keane-level background-rock stardom. <br/></p><p>
    Around the internet, Goldrush's RIYL pretty much comes down
    to the melodic shoegaze of Ride plus the ringing folk-rock of Neil Young circa <em>After the Gold Rush</em>. Um, OK. Now,
    Goldrush probably know Ride better than I do; I may have listened to
    ""Vapour Trail"" nearly every day for six months back in 2003, but
    these guys backed ex-Ride frontman Mark Gardener on his 2005 solo outing.
    However, the glinting acoustic guitars, thinly compressed lead guitar whorls, and
    unobtrusive electronics of <em>The Heart Is
    the Place</em> have more in common with Snow Patrol's sensitive arena-rock, minus Gary Lightbody's underrated songwriting acumen.  Nor is the stoned-Young piano homage of <em>The Heart Is the Place</em>'s ""Yours and Mine"" enough to earn such a slick-sounding record a
    prominent spot in that Canadian's ragged lineage.</p><p>
    Like similarly over-polished UK rockers Fields, Goldrush do have catchy moments.  ""Every One of
    Us"" is a light, inclusive pop song that sets cleaned-up shoegaze
    cloudbursts against
    vaguely uplifting hooks and synthesized strings. ""We are not the way that
    we were/ She will forget about you, so forget about her,""
    vocalist/guitarist Robin Bennett sings with breathy emotion, capping one of the
    band's more memorable melodies. The next track, ""Can't Give Up the
    Ghost"", may be a weeper reminiscent of Jimmy Eat World's dippiest ballads, but it's a
    candidate for the Zach Braff sweepstakes. ""If you're really so small/ In the scheme of it all/ Then you've gotta stand tall,""
    Bennett insists. Goldrush get more compelling, if less immediate, on weirder
    songs like ""Sun in Your Eyes"", with its angelic harmonies and an eerie horn section out of Radiohead's ""The National Anthem"".<br/>
</p><p>
<em>The Heart Is the Place</em>
    is the latest in the recent trend of EZ-indie albums that sound like they're
    trying so hard not to stand out that they, indeed, fail to stand out. Even the
    occasional distorted guitar solo, as on ""We Will Not Be Machines"", is still
    restrained enough to keep from alienating potential record-buying
    demographics. On this song and elsewhere, Bennett's lyrics are often so simple and declarative as to be
    meaningless: ""Words are sometimes so obscene,"" he sings. On the title
    track, Bennett adds, ""Maybe the best is yet to come/ Just you, me, and
    everyone,"" a line that could've been sung by, well, just about anyone. Then
    again, anyone can strike it rich in a gold rush, too, with the right amount of luck.
    It's what happens after that counts.

    There's about eight years between the first and second tracks on <em>Unbreakable</em> <em>(A Retrospective)</em>, immediately revealing how much
    the Afghan Whigs developed over a decade, what was gained in the process, and
    what was lost. Opener ""Retarded"", from 1990's <em>Up In It</em>, a lo-fi maelstrom of raw, threatening guitars, introduces
    the band's defining elements: the knife-fight between guitar players Greg Dulli
    and Rick McCollum, soul and funk melodies ratcheted to aggressive tempos, and
    Dulli's in-character performance (""Motherfucker lied to you,"" he snarls), which
    detractors would label ""posturing"" throughout the 1990s. Following ""Retarded""
    is ""Crazy"", from the band's 1998 swan song <em>1965</em>;
    it's slicker and more controlled, dialing down its tempo and
    filling its empty spaces with ""Soul Finger""-style party chatter, yet sacrificing not
    one iota of menace.</p><p>
<em>Unbreakable</em>, a
    best-of collection that democratically gathers tracks from every facet of the
    band's career, along with <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/forkcast/43234-the-afghan-whigs-im-a-soldier-magazine""><strong>two newly recorded songs</strong></a>, is a sort of last laugh.
    Despite their stature today (there's a 33 1/3 book on <em>Gentlemen</em> in the works), the band-- and especially Dulli-- were
    largely neglected during the 1990s, relegated to second-tier status behind alt- bands such as Live, Alice in Chains, and Candlebox. Formed
    in Cincinnati in 1986 and defunct
    by 2001, the Afghan Whigs were one of the few alt- bands to flourish on a major
    label, where greater control and bigger budgets allowed them to indulge every
    sinister urge. While alternative rock radio still sported untucked flannel, the
    Whigs looked dapper in all black or tailored suits. When popular music was at
    its most studiously PC, the Whigs emphasized the sexual, and Dulli played
    power-struggle games that many read as misogynist.</p><p>
    While their peers could barely see past the Who, the
    Whigs were digging through the Stax Records catalog and covering the Supremes (""Come See
    About Me"" is included here). Even on their early tracks, the band found a way
    to integrate African-American sounds and influences into their white rock:
    ""Turn on the Water"", from 1991's <em>Congregation</em>
    (whose album cover infamously features a nude black woman holding a white baby, no less)
    uses Isaac Hayes' wakka-chikka guitars as a punk accessory, and its jumpy
    guitar riffs instill these songs with a sense of motion that suggests amped-up
    r&amp;b. <em>Black Love</em>, the band's 1996
    blaxploitation-rock epic, should have been the culmination of this trend, but
    in 1996 it sounded overdone and obvious. <em>Unbreakable</em>,
    however, reveals <em>Black Love</em> to be a
    closet singles album, fitting three still-visceral songs into the tracklist but
    making ""Blame Etc."" and ""Honky's Ladder"" the most glaring omissions.
    </p>
<p>
    With more dry wit and intelligent frustration than was often
    recognized, Dulli's lyrics were also intensely personal in their intimate
    sadomasochism, to the extent that he invited Scrawl's Marcy Mays to sing ""My
    Curse"" on <em>Gentlemen</em> because he
    couldn't bring himself to do it (nor could the producers include it here). Taken at face value, though, Dulli's songs made
    him out to be an asshole, so that's what people assumed he was. And he likely
    played that up, too. But on <em>Unbreakable</em>,
    the hyperbolic tension of his lyrics plays as an amplification of his own
    angst, not as a one-to-one projection. He wasn't necessarily the people he sang
    about, but they were certainly part of him. The leering threats of ""Be Sweet""
    and ""66"" might best be read as useful exaggerations. And yet, Dulli's voice
    wavers on the quieter, slower numbers. He misses notes on ""Faded"", muddles his
    phrasing on the new track ""Magazine"", but never self-censors. He lets the
    moment stand, powerful in its imperfection, the sound of someone trying to convey overwhelming inner conflict. At a time when many
    bands strained to project anguish, Dulli kept his
    performances as raw as the hurt he's singing about.
    </p>
<p>
    The two newly recorded tracks-- the band's first since their
    break-up in 2001-- are surprisingly strong, picking up pretty much where <em>1965</em> left off. It's nice to hear
    McCollum's guitar slicing at Dulli again and Curley's bass trying to break them
    up. After the military grunts that count off ""I'm a Soldier"", the band launches
    into a massive gospel assault that prominently features Memphis vocalist Susan
    Marshall (who also appeared on <em>1965</em>),
    as if they had the audacity to rewrite ""Gimme Shelter"" with a three-note chorus
    and cagier lyrics. Written shortly before the band split six years ago, ""Magazine"" begins as
    a slow ballad, but builds into something more angular, lacking a hook but still
    intriguing. 
    </p>
<p>
    Rather than presenting these songs chronologically-- starting
    with their earliest Sub Pop  singles and
    ending with their newly recorded tracks-- <em>Unbreakable</em>
    is sequenced more organically and intuitively, mixing together songs from each
    phase of their career so that they comment on one another. Ultimately, the
    tracklist comprises a larger, self-mythologizing narrative-- culminating in the
    sweeping drama of ""Crime Scene Part One"" and ""Faded"", both from <em>Black Love</em>-- that fits well with the
    Whigs' album-as-song-cycle approach. <em>Unbreakable</em>
    is one of those rare career compilations that shows its subject in a new and
    immensely flattering light, with the potential to clear up past misperceptions
    and to reveal vast complexities that were previously overlooked.

    When Robert Pollard disbanded GBV, but
    announced he still intended to record, the big question was: ""...then
    why bother?"" Pollard was the obvious creative center of the
    group, to the point that, particularly in the later years, many considered GBV little more than a revolving door (which
    isn't very fair to guitarist Doug Gillard, among many others). What would be the point of continuing under his own name? Another EP
    from Pollard is hard to get excited about considering the deluge
    around it, but it's a good time to stop and address that earlier
    question of why. Having released a good chunk of material in the
    two years since disbanding GBV (you expected anything less?) with collaborative
    partner Todd Tobias as producer, we're finally getting an answer--
    and you might not like it.</p><p>
    The uncertain sound of the ""record""
    button being pressed couldn't be more comforting at the top of
    opener ""Come Outside"", and the string section that follows
    couldn't sound simpler or sweeter. A promising, wordless start, but these
    interludes are bookends on mostly predictable material. While
    the final moments ""Circle Saw Boys Club"" has an unexpected
    escalation into grandeur, and ""Touched to Be Sure"" features the disc's
    most memorable melody, both tracks are ponderous, sluggish, and
    smothered in easy-atmosphere background synthesizers.</p><p>
    Fortunately,
    the whole of the EP is much more diverse, with the aforementioned
    bookends and interludes that push Pollard out of his comfort zone. There's the warm organ drone of ""Wickerman Smile"" and the
    instrumental ""Waves, Etc."", with keyboards that'd be
    comfortable on an Angelo Badalamenti soundtrack or (more likely) a Circus
    Devils album. And then there's the eight-minute ""Cats Love a
    Parade"", which follows much the same pattern as ""Boys Club"" or
    ""Touched"", before taking a left turn into a near-industrial lurch
    halfway through, while Pollard adopts a husky, creepy tone and
    repeats the song's strange chorus at length. These three songs
    together suggest similar tones to Pollard's recent Merge albums, but with
    higher compositional ambition that approaches his traditional DIY
    stadium-rock from another angle. 
    </p>
<p>
    The variety represented here isn't just reassuring,
    it's badly needed. And while it's not surprising that the Pollard/Tobias
    partnership might return to the well and draw inspiration from their
    material together as the Circus Devils, to take their more
    synth-oriented work and add a dash of Pollard's everyman guitar strums
    and his newly acquired sensitive bleat to create flowery
    adult-contempo pap-- this isn't a road I want to follow him down.
    Perhaps he'll continue to stretch his compositions, but if the choice
    is between ""Circle Saw Boys Club"" or the strange ambitions of ""Cats Love a Parade"", I
    choose door number three.

    At the tail end of last year, Espers' Meg Baird released <em>Leaves From Off the Tree</em>, a collection of traditional English and Appalachian folk songs recorded in a trio with British singer Sharron Kraus and her Espers bandmate Helena Espvall. Casting aside Espers' baroque psychedelia and hushed electricity, Baird and her friends showcased a breathtaking affinity for this traditional material with their spare, homespun arrangements and bracing vocal harmonies. The relaxed atmosphere and spirit of that album now shines through again on <em>Dear Companion</em>, Baird's captivating new solo collection of traditional ballads, unlikely covers, and well-crafted originals.</p><p>
    Recorded in her Philadelphia attic apartment between sessions for <em>Espers II</em>, the album features Baird using only her voice, guitar, and/or mountain dulcimer. For these deeply intimate recordings, Baird has clearly chosen songs that she knows inside and out, and is so able to treat each with an overriding empathy and affection. Her faith in this material helps give <em>Dear Companion</em> its easy air of self-assurance, but most often it is her astonishing voice that draws the attention. At once delicate and earthy, Baird's vocals sound naturally suited to the purpose of breathing fragile new life into these romantic tales of love gained and lost, as she firmly stakes a claim in the folk lineage alongside such 60s-era artists as Shirley Collins or Anne Briggs.</p><p>
    Two of the traditional songs on <em>Dear Companion--"" </em>The Cruelty of Barbary Allen"" and ""Willie O'Winsbury""-- also appeared in different versions on <em>Leaves From Off the Tree</em>. And Baird's stunning performances here amply illustrate several of the reasons why these ballads have been among the most frequently re-interpreted (and dissected) folk songs of the past few centuries. Outfitted with their simple, eternal melodies, each of these songs frames a deceptively oblique romantic narrative that is open to enough analysis and interpretation to fuel a full semester's gender studies curriculum. (Poet and scholar Robert Graves, for example, once even speculated that the poor misunderstood Barbary Allen was in fact practicing witchcraft and murder.) For her part, Baird wisely chooses to let these songs speak for themselves, delivering them simply with a thoughtful, meditative air of eyewitness. 
    </p>
<p>
    Although several of these traditional ballads do feature some anachronistic imagery and language--including the occasional reference to kings, maidens and lords-- Baird is careful to balance the album with several tracks of more modern origin, skillfully blurring the distinction between the various vintages. The infidelity and loss of the title track--an old Appalachian folk song--is mirrored almost exactly on Baird's stoic version of Jimmy Webb's ""Do What You Gotta Do"", a song perhaps most memorably associated with Nina Simone. And Baird strikes the album's most sensuous note with her cover of ""Waltze of the Tennis Players"", which was originally written and recorded by the obscure 70s folk act Fraser &amp; Debolt. ""My love for you is an overnight sensation,"" she sings in a seductive near-whisper, a sentiment which surely echoes the thoughts that fans of exquisitely wrought folk music will have for this lovely and enrapturing album.

    Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori pioneered the theory of the ""uncanny
    valley."" It holds that humanoid robots produce positive emotional
    responses in humans both <em>up to</em> a certain point of realism (the
    ""barely-human"") and <em>after</em> utter realism has been achieved. The
    gray area in between is the uncanny valley, a level of not-quite-realism that
    produces feelings of unease. Think wax mannequins and lifelike yet gesturally
    stilted automatons, how they seem to question fundamental boundaries of the
    human.</p><p>
    The natural history museum-- especially the small-town variety that get by
    on ingenuity more than funding, where cavemen, Native Americans, flora, and
    fauna are frozen in glass-encased, fluorescent-lit pantomime-- resides in the
    uncanny valley of humanity's relationship to nature. Feltbattery's homemade
    sound art is the natural history museum in a recorded format. In the small
    North Carolina town of Hillsborough, Benjamin Trueblood and friends run
    birdsong, minimal percussion, humming voice, flute, recorder, and charango (a
    small South American lute) through pedals and laptops, arranging them in long,
    cycling loops. While the skewed natural representations of <em>It Had Wings</em>
    produce a lingering eeriness, their beatific phrasing undercuts their sense of
    unease. Here are some excerpts from the Feltbattery blog:</p><p>
    ""<em>Spring is creeping in, soggy toes and green everywhere...I've been
    paying attention to the colony collapse situation with our friends the bees and
    listening to the forest with all my little second graders. So much life and so
    much death...Incidentally, the house finches that inspired the piece 'a house finch'
    on </em>It Had Wings<em> have returned to nest in the rafters of my porch. I am
    going to try to record them again and perhaps make a video...</em>"" 
    </p>
<p>
    The reverent attention writ large in these musings is what makes
    Feltbattery's compositions resonate more broadly than their minimal sound
    palettes would seem to merit. On a subconscious level, art retains the aura of
    the work that went into it, and pragmatically, Trueblood's diligence has
    produced a compositionally sly album that works equally well as one long arrangement
    or eight discrete movements. Each track is dominated by a handful of repetitive
    rhythmic elements and a mood; a hypnotic continuity is achieved largely by
    holding over one element of the previous track in each new one. 
    </p>
<p>
    So leaving behind the twittering nest of ""Birds Flew"", squiggly
    flutes plunge into the insistent rhythm and thickly textured ratcheting sounds
    (rather like something snorting and rooting in turf) of ""Meganser
    (Hooded)"". The flutes, shakers, and rooting sounds are rounded out by
    burbling hand percussion, woodland chatter, and cicada chirrs on ""Mock
    Influenza"", and the chirring bends into a high insectile whine amid the
    amplified beat of wings, insistent metallic percussion, and loopy vocal
    harmonies with jarring rhythmic squawks of ""Garuda"". The spiraling
    squawks gradually overtake the track and become the foundation of ""Split
    the Polygon"", then sporadically reappear throughout the monastic drones
    and graceful, chuffing fans of ""A House Finch"", which works itself
    into a gently convulsive electrical storm. 
    </p>
<p>
    The final two tracks are a digest of the record's motifs, making for an
    understated crescendo, and <em>It Had Wings</em> ends with the snore of something
    that sounds large, something that, despite the record's placidity, one hopes
    will not wake up. Such ominous notes occur throughout Trueblood's idyllic
    meditations, and paired with the album's almost-natural affect, it renders his

Many of its best artists (Fugazi, Nation of Ulysses, Circus Lupus) approached transcendent outrage in oblique and radically different ways, but they all sounded larger than the sum of their parts. In the past few years, bands such as Q and Not U and Black Eyes drank deep from a more tourettically rhythmic form of rage, but it's been rage just the same. D.C. punk bands, however, rarely last for more than an album or two, and both of those bands have already broken up; the only surviving band from Dischord's mid-90s peak is Lungfish. In recent years, the label has gone small, releasing a string of records that look inward as much as outward, like the two prettily hushed albums by Ian MacKaye and Amy Farina's Evens. And now they've got Antelope, a trio who's muted restraint often prevents them from writing songs that even resonate as songs, let alone anthems; draw from that whatever conclusions you like about the state of American post-punk.</p><p>
<em>Reflector</em> is Antelope's first full-length, if you can call a 10-song, 25-minute CD a full-length. It might be the cleanest-sounding record that Dischord has ever released-- or at least since that last Fidelity Jones album. Everything is restrained and minimal: the flinty and trebley guitar lines, the clearly enunciated vocals, the tick-tock pulse-drums. Sometimes, that cold sparseness serves the band well, as on the opening title track, which marries a glimmering motorik bassline to a gorgeously longing vocal from former Vertebrate Bee Elvy. Other times, it results in annoying messes like the obnoxiously monotonous ""Contraction"", which manages to be harsh and choppy without building up the slightest hint of catharsis and which seems way longer than its two-and-a-half minutes.</p><p>
    Eventually, a pattern emerges. The band splits its vocal duties between two poles, with Elvy's melodious coo sharing space with the violent adenoidal honks of fellow former Vertebrate Mike Andre and former El Guapo and Supersystem member Justin Moyer. (Andre and Moyer's vocals sound so alike that this review originally credited all of them to Moyer.) When Elvy sings lead, the songs are usually slight, diffuse, supple and pretty little trifles of kraut-psych wonder. When Moyer or Andre sings lead, the tracks begin to sound like a fourth-grader making fun of you. In Supersystem, Moyer's nasal yawp was put to good use, bouncing around in that band's sometimes-glorious, always-furious dancepunk clutter. In Antelope's geometric openness, though, that voice has nowhere to hide. Tracks like ""Justin Jesus"" sound informed by Lungfish without actually rocking at all, a hard thing to pull off, and his lyrics tend toward inscrutable bullshit: ""Pisces in the breach/ An elemental monument to mirth/ A psychic stand/ Three-fingered hand."" And so Reflector is a curious document of a band at a crossroads. Right now, they're half of a good band. If they let Elvy take over completely, they could blossom into a melting mountain of gooey beauty. If Moyer and/or Andre takes control, they'll march onward toward unlistenability. And if they continue to split duties, they'll keep churning out slight and half-decent albums like this one. Knowing D.C., though, they'll probably break up before moving in any of those directions. <br/></p></div>"|10256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10256-reflector/|5.1|Tom Breihan

    There's little use in debating whether or not Jeff Buckley's legacy is best served by a seemingly endless stream of posthumous releases.  Buckley's music and persona are cemented in the pop music canon even before the repackaging, re-sequencing, or re-mastering. And given that Buckley only released one proper LP in his lifetime, it makes sense that these reissues-- including the latest, <em>So Real--</em> offer little in the way of either consistency or deeper perspective.</p><p>
    Playing more like a label-mandated promotional release for an
    up-and-coming artist than a thorough retrospective of one of rock's contemporary greats, <em>So Real</em> showcases the arc of Buckley's career in a chronologically scattered and not-particularly-enlightening way. Buckley's three best-known releases-- the <em>Live at Sin-e</em> EP, <em>Grace</em>, and the unfinished <em>Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk</em>-- each encapsulates a distinct moment in Buckley's career, and together constitute a fairly complete snapshot of his musical goals and aspirations. This compilation, however, demonstrates no such personal depth, showcasing Buckley's talents while omitting his inspired missteps.</p><p>
    There's very little new that can be said about the cuts taken from <em>Grace</em> and <em>Live at Sin-e</em>.  The choices are even pretty obvious: ""Lover, You Should've Come Over"", ""Grace"", ""Last Goodbye"", and ""Hallelujah"" from the former; ""Mojo Pin"" and ""Je n'en Connais Pas La Fin"" from the latter.  Mediocre outtake ""Forget Her"" and a sped-up ""road version"" of ""Eternal Life"" are culled from the still-freshly-released ""Legacy Edition"" of <em>Grace</em>.  The only at all questionable omission here is that of ""Morning Theft"", a fan favorite and by far one of the strongest tracks on <em>Sketches</em>.</p><p>
    The three tracks chosen to represent <em>Sketches</em>-- ""The Sky Is a Landfill"", ""Everybody Here Wants You"", and ""Vancouver""-- all speak to the largely unacknowledged influence of D.C. art-rockers Shudder to Think on Buckley's later work. After the release of <em>Grace</em>, Buckley spent some time playing bass in Shudder guitarist Nathan Larson's underrated Mind Science of the Mind project, and the influence is apparent in <em>Sketches</em>' flashes of inspired, angular weirdness.  Listening to ""The Sky Is a Landfill"", in particular, it's clear that Buckley was beginning to explore a more discordant and subversive approach, even if he hadn't quite figured out how to execute it.  One can see why Buckley wished to re-record the songs that were released as <em>Sketches</em>-- while his vocals are in prime form, his band lacks the cohesive, communicative energy that makes Shudder's <em>Pony Express Record</em> so amazing.</p><p>
    You can hear Buckley growing more lyrically adventurous too, with similarly mixed results.  The straightforward, lovelorn words of ""Last Goodbye"" and ""Lover, You Should've Come Over"" perfectly suit that era of Buckley's material.  The more impressionistic lines of ""The Sky Is a Landfill"" and ""Vancouver"" are a striking contrast; ambitious, overreaching, and occasionally very awkward and clumsy.  No matter how many live albums, B-sides, and covers surface, the unbelievably sad truth remains that the record <em>Sketches</em> hints at-- a more sinister, dissonant and explosive take on Buckley's heart-on-sleeve romanticism-- will never be heard. </p><p>
    The inclusion of a single previously unreleased track (a fairly predictable cover of the Smiths' ""I Know It's Over"") hints that this compilation is meant for completists as well as newcomers.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have much to offer either.  Buckley's legacy is necessarily imperfect, inconsistent, frustrating, and exhilarating, and the ""best-of"" treatment ultimately does nothing to bring out the best in his work.<br/>

First, you have cheapies like <i>Beach Boys Greatest Hits Vols. 1, 2 and 3</i>, each gathering a dozen or so singles into a succinct package. With such a deep collection of quality hits,     the Beach Boys could continue to repackage these in various combinations     forever. Various permutations can still be found on cassette in gas     stations from coast-to-coast.</p>
<p>Then there's <i>Endless Summer</i>, from 1974, the prototype for the     expanded compilation that gathers hits but also attempts to position the band as an iconic snapshot of a bygone era. It's hard to convey now how massive that double-LP set was during the remainder of that decade. Widely considered     all the Beach Boys anyone ever needed, <i>Endless Summer</i> charted for three straight years and launched the idea of the band as     a touring oldies act-- a nostalgic fantasyland you could revisit where Vietnam never     happened and baby boomers never had to face the responsibilities of     parenthood. Almost everything on the record predated <i>Pet Sounds</i>, before things     got heavy and complicated. Even #1 single ""Good Vibrations"", often called the band's (and sometimes pop music's) peak, had to wait for the CD     reissue in the 80s to come along for the carefree ride. In 2003, a new set, <i>Sound of Summer, </i>properly updated the ""Only Beach Boys You Ever Need"" comp for the     era of the 80-minute CD, and (again) went multi-platinum.</p>
<p>The third kind of Beach Boys collection tries to tell the alternate history     of the band-- the one that didn't stop making music after <i>Smile </i>fell     apart in 1967. This Beach Boys had to contend with an increasingly awkward-sounding bandname, naïve politics, a shift in creative energy away from Brian Wilson, and     a generally fuzzy notion of what ""The Beach Boys"" as an idea was all     about. Most Pitchfork readers are familiar with this period of the band's career--     they're used to debating how <i>Wild Honey </i>stacks up against <i>Sunflower</i>,     and trying to figure out which of the mid-70s albums has the most to recommend.     But most of this stuff, to many music fans, remains largely off the radar. These are the fans that     alternative-history Beach Boys comps mean to bring into the     fold.</p>
<p><i>Good Vibrations</i>, from 1975, <i>Ten Years of Harmony</i> (1981),     and <i>Sunshine Dream</i> (1982) were the first of these alternative     histories, each offering a look at the ""<i>Pet Sounds </i>and after"" Beach     Boys from a slightly different angle. The new compilation <i>The Warmth of the     Sun </i>takes a similar approach and applies it to the Beach Boys' entire     career. So along with a generous helping of the post-<i>Smile </i>material (nothing from <i>Pet Sounds </i>or <i>Smiley     Smile </i>is here), there's also a sampling of minor earlier hits. There's even     one 80s curio: a truly awful version of ""California Dreamin'"" cut     for inclusion on <i>Made in U.S.A.</i>, the 1986 half-old-faves/half-deep-cuts     compilation notable for including four tracks from the then out-of-print (!) <i>Pet     Sounds</i>. ""California Dreamin'"" is the highest-charting single     here, hitting #8-- on the Adult Contemporary chart, that is. On the Pop charts,     like almost all of these 28 songs, it didn't crack the Top 40.</p>
<p><i>Warmth of the Sun </i>isn't chronologically sequenced; instead, songs seem to be grouped together     in a rough thematic configuration. ""All Summer Long"" is an excellent     opening thesis, but then the comp detours with four kitschy throwbacks in a row-- two about surfing (""Catch a Wave"" and     ""Hawaii"") and two about cars (""Little Honda"" and     ""409""). The chorus of ""Little Honda"" is still something to     behold, the way the backup vocals chug along like pistons while Mike Love gets     us up to third gear. But ""409"" sounds like a middling test-run from     the Chuck Berry rip-off days, and the dippy ""Hawaii"" is interesting     only as history (""I don't know what town you're from, but don't tell me     they have bigger waves/ Everyone that goes comes back with nothing but     raves"").</p>
<p>The meat of the lesser pre-<i>Pet Sounds </i>material are the songs that     showed how far Brian Wilson's art had come even before he was considered a     great artist. ""Let Him Run Wild"" (remixed for stereo here) is one of     his most fully realized arrangements, the surging dynamics in the chorus     perfectly mirroring the narrator's unhinged frustration at an unrequited     lover's fondness for the bad boy, while Mike Love's ""guess you know I     waited for you, girl"" bass part allows him to regain his composure.     ""The Little Girl I Once Knew"" follows, and then when the bass notes     introduce the breathtaking ""Wendy"" (also in a new stereo mix, with     the famous cough deleted), we get the perfect triptych of romantic     longing, Beach Boys-style.</p>
<p>Then come the post-<i>Smile </i>years, from which <i>The Warmth of the Sun </i>chooses     remarkably well. Songs like ""Forever"", ""Friends"", and     ""Feel Flows"" demonstrate how they turned into a very capable-- even     adventurous-- group of songwriters. They were becoming ""West Coast"" in     the 70s sense of the term, with songs that were tuneful, professionally sung and     recorded, laidback, and vaguely spiritual. Throw in ""Til I Die"",     ""Cool, Cool Water"" and the album version of ""Surf's Up"" and     you're talking about tremendously sophisticated pop that ably extended the     innovations of the 60s, admittedly by recycling old ideas.</p>
<p>We end, appropriately enough, with the couples-only prom-night classic     ""Warmth of the Sun"". In addition to being one of the Beach Boys' most     beautiful ballads, it also represents Capitol's hopes for the continuing appeal     of the band's catalog, a collective wish that their music is permanently     embedded in pop music's DNA, and that it, like the warmth of the sun itself, will only grow stronger in the coming years. As long as these kinds of smartly sequenced compilations keep on coming, such longevity seems like a safe bet.</p></div>"|10271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10271-the-warmth-of-the-sun/|8.6|Mark Richardson

For his solo debut, <i>Poste e Telegrafi</i>, Stefana treats his     guitar like a quarter-piece of the puzzle. He collaborates with six people and     avoids the guitar altogether on two of these seven tracks. He alternately     employs the 1980s electronics artifact the omnichord, a ""strings machine,""     various African percussion instruments, and vinyl loops to build intricate,     subtly shaped substrates for his meticulous, twang-redolent guitar fantasies.     Largely because it avoids the solo guitar record template, <i>Poste e Telegrafi</i> is one of the most     striking works you'll hear from a young composer all year.</p>
<p>It's     not as if Stefana is hiding anything. His guitar playing is graceful and     dexterous, his fluid phrases are precise without feeling stiff. He's not trying     to make himself sound better by playing with slouches, either. The cast here     includes guitar maverick Marc Ribot, Italian songwriter Marco Parente, and     Brian Eno/Nick Cave collaborator Leo Abrahams. But of special interest is     Ribot, who's spent the past two decades planting six-string sparks in albums     like Tom Waits' <i>Rain Dogs</i>, Richard     Buckner's <i>Devotion &amp; Doubt</i>,<i> </i>and     several volumes of John Zorn's <i>Film Works</i>.     A young guitarist and composer trying to establish himself while asking Ribot     to take a solo on his debut is tantamount to Menomena asking David Byrne to     sing a song on their first record. But on ""Poste e Telegrafi Blues"",     Stefana and Parente build a bouncing groove, all heavy, stutter-step drums and     arpeggiating electronics, only for Ribot to light it on fire. He swoops in and     hurls out one of the most vital, urgent solos of his career, his savage, gritty     tone biting Keith Richards circa ""Sympathy for the Devil"" while     teasing out the melody in broken clips and phrases like your favorite     saxophonist between 1960 and 1967. It's a brilliant minute.</p>
<p>Smartly,     ""Blues"" is both the album's centerpiece and climax, the track's     frenetic action a fitting apex for the three cuts surrounding it on either     side. The rest of <i>Poste e Telegrafi</i> either builds to or from Ribot's massive solo through Stefana's beautiful     guitar-and-sidemen hazes. ""Semi Tostada di Cielo"", the anchor of the     first half, showcases Stefana alone, his Bill Frisell-built guitar phrases     registering like sentimental confessions without words. But much like one of     his few ranking contemporaries, James Blackshaw, Stefana is only intrigued by     the sound of his own guitar only to a point. Midway through the nine-minute     odyssey, he corrodes his own pearl, fancying a cacophony of hammered West     African percussion staple the balaphon and letting barely perceptible guitar     tones slip beneath. The guitar ultimately crawls from the confusion, emerging     shaken, its slow, sliding moan a bit closer to expiring in the song's second     half.</p>
<p>The     album's falling action hinges on ""Whales Cemetery,"" Stefana's duet     with Enrico Gabrielli's bass clarinet. Stefana's playing is reserved and razor     thin here, setting the bait for Gabrielli's colossal terratone. When it     arrives, it shakes the framework, pushing the capacity of its microphone and     your speakers, and saturating the ground beneath Stefana's Morricone-like     portrait. It's dramatic and careful, a more compelling use of torpid, heavy     winds than either Earth or Sunn 0))) has found through Steve Moore's trombone     on <i>Hex</i>, <i>Altar</i> and <i>Hibernaculum</i>.     Gabrielli's clarinet is impressive, in large part, because of Stefana's     constraint as a composer and arranger. That is, Gabrielli's presence means so     much because he plays for much less than half of the piece.</p>
<p>All     of Stefana's compositions are defined somewhat by negative space, meaning he's     able to say as much with the absence of a note as he is with the presence of     20. Opener ""Western Soda"" stumbles forward in regular rhythmic     convulsions, a junk percussion loop reminiscent of Tom Waits' <i>Real Gone </i>allowing Stefana's picked-and-strummed     banjo notes to drop casually and naturally, like hued leaves in the autumn     wind. On the austere ""Motel"", Stefana climbs up and down one gentle     pattern, eventually doubling the guitar and letting faint veils of feedback and     a web of cymbal scrapes fall between his most distant notes.</p>
<p>The     ends of Stafana's phrases, though, are about not perfecting the right note,     but, instead, letting the assumed resolution arrive slightly altered. The     climax, to wit, is one lonesome pedal steel note pushed through a web of     effects. It sounds more like Glenn Branca conducting 100 guitars than one being     built into something else entirely, like a cathedral carved from a single     stone. These are rare talents for someone so young, and, given <i>Poste e Telegrafi</i>,<i> </i>Stefana sounds as if he'll be wielding     them among the heavyweights for a long time to come.</p></div>"|10245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10245-poste-y-telegrafi/|7.8|Grayson Currin

    Lewis and Clarke, fronted by singer-songwriter Lou Rogai and here helped by
    Eve Miller of Rachel's and Russell Higbee of Man Man, have for several years
    quietly glorified the sound of strings. This second full-length is a pared-down
    complement to 2005's blues-inspired <em>Bare Bones and Branches</em>. <em>Blasts
    of Holy Birth</em> is at times cloying, weepy, and overly familiar, but at
    others it's a naturalistic vision that creates a hunger for some the simple,
    rural images conjured by the instruments.</p><p>
    Sometimes words get in the way, as on ""We Think We Have Eyes"", a
    song thick with a generalized guilt and self-awareness. Greed is a perfectly
    apt subject from a ruminative musician, but the lyrics here are delicately
    trampled upon, potentially forgettable and incidental, perhaps because Rogai's
    voice has all the force of a light breeze. While his tone complements the
    soothing guitar and occasional cello, it's less successful as the carrier of a
    message. Still, the song's undulating chorus recalls the rare beauty of Matt
    Pond PA, who's also a contributor here. Rogai's lyrical dive-off just before
    this moment is perfectly executed, the words punching out their meaning in
    time to the strings.</p><p>
    Tara Jane O'Neil has a command of atmosphere similar to Lewis &amp; Clarke,
    the way she showcases the string family without overindulging how instinctively
    <em>of the land</em> they are. The wandering slides and sixth chords on the
    opener ""Secret of the Golden Flower"" are a reminder of this
    respectful approach, where a very simple grouping of sounds are pushed to their
    limits with a few effects. The mystical, natural homages in Rogai's vision are
    conveyed, though our notion of what exactly the ""golden flower"" is
    remains vague. The following title track is less successful, its sweet sap and
    lullaby rhythm too predictable, the instruments too obedient to the typical
    progressions. But at nearly seven minutes, it's not all dross: the quiet
    moments (plucks) and loudest (shimmying ascents) are fairly interesting.
    </p>
<p>
    The runaway road-trip ballad ""Comfort Inn"" is a little too Ray
    LaMontagne, with vocals turned up and guitar plucks skittering around the
    song's hollow, empty room. The contrast it makes to ""Black Dove"" and
    to the final track, ""Be the Air We Breathe"", actually bolsters them
    all -- to shift from this man-and-guitar stereotype to the gorgeous summit of
    ""Breathe"" is a worthy journey. ""Breathe"" is where Rogai
    realizes the most redeemable elements of his other tracks: little alterations
    of typical chords, locomotive but understated drums, a forceful but controlled
    rhythm, and several layers of string dialog. ""Black Dove"" works with
    similar success, with more thunderous guitars evoking an idealized environment
    that's unplugged, untouched, and unspoiled.

    Unless you're a coffee-addled Seattle scenester with a keen
    ear to the ground, chances are you heard of Night Canopy because their lineup
    contains former Pretty Girls Make Graves drummer Nick DeWitt, not because
    they're fronted by Emerald City singer-songwriter Amy Blaschke. In DeWiit's
    soon-to-be extinct former band, the drummer/multi-instrumentalist busted his
    ass to keep up with PGMG's breakneck tempos and swirling melodies. Night Canopy
    must feel like a retirement home for DeWitt by comparison, as he peppers
    Blaschke's easy-does-it folk numbers with innocuous instrumental texture.</p><p>
<em>Of Country and Honey</em> essentially sounds like a singer-songwriter solo
    album that scored a primo arranger in DeWitt. Blaschke's moody tales of love
    won and love lost take center stage here, even if that means downplaying the
    rest of the band. At her best, Blaschke writes gnarled folk songs able to
    conjure the haunting demons her previous-- and blander-- solo material could
    only allude to with cheap lyrics. At her worst, she sounds like backwater from
    Saddle Creek, her vanilla dirges plodding about as forgettably as Maria Taylor,
    the tempo, at times, even <em>slower</em> somehow.</p><p>
    Hopefully, as the album's schizo nature suggests, Blaschke is at a
    crossroads stylistically and not entirely wedded to this ""Home on the
    Range""-sounding filler. As with nearly every ""tortured""
    singer-songwriter these days, publicity releases and half-assed write-ups will
    throw out Elliott Smith comparisons. In reality, neither Blaschke's depression
    nor dementia can hold a candle to something like <em>Either/Or</em>, though her
    country-tinged catatonic despair echoes more recent acts Cat Power or
    Broadcast. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Signs of Life"" bucks the linear songwriting found on most of <em>Of
    Honey and Country</em>, with a creepy organ and clanging percussion burying
    Blaschke's distant vocals. Even further out in left field, the 80-second French
    number ""Elle Etait"" recalls Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot's
    collaborations, explosively jumping from one melodic idea to another at the
    sound of a massive cymbal crash or squealing violin. 
    </p>
<p>
    These avant-garde tracks are exceptions, however, as most of this album
    falls within the conventionality of an open mic at Starbucks. Opener
    ""Seasick Casanova"" very acutely forecasts the album's low-lying
    goals. Kicking off with a hokey ocean wave sound effect, Blaschke's songwriting
    colors too perfectly within the lines, content with lullaby-level complexity.
    Even more disappointing, Blaschke doesn't sound engaged in her own songs, even
    with a ripe title like ""Seasick Casanova"". On stripped-down tracks
    like ""Tell Me You Been Lyin'"" and ""Double or Nothing"",
    DeWitt gets sent on an apparent bathroom break, spotting Blaschke's acoustic
    ditties with little more than some keyboard or (seriously) chirping bird sound
    effects. 
    </p>

    Except for some brief, urgent outbursts, Blaschke's charisma could use a
    jumpstart-- or at least DeWitt could take the heat off with something more
    scintillating than his quaint, table-setting accompaniments. Hopefully Night
    Canopy's still a project very much under construction, a team-up that just
    hasn't found its chemistry, because as their default songs reveal, the band's
    got its fair share of kinks to work out.

Boeckner's Handsome Furs, his Wolf Parade side project with fiancée Alexei Perry, also locates its tired heart in a machine. When Boeckner told Pitchfork a few months ago that Handsome Furs were ""basically Wolf Parade without the guy that everybody likes and no real instruments,"" he might as well have said, ""...with a drum machine instead of a drummer."" That trade-off seems to have determined their debut album's tone and texture, because each of the record's nine songs moves to a precise beat that's rarely changed or improvised, doesn't adjust speeds, and can't sense the intentions of the other players. Thus, <em>Plague Park</em> creates a feeling of listlessness and jet-lag-- too much potential and too little movement.</p><p>
    This was always the band's intention, it seems-- even in their most prominent press photo, they display a disaffected, decadent boredom. Because each song on <em>Plague Park</em> seamlessly moves into the next, and since both halves of Handsome Furs make a living as writers (one of Perry's poems was part of ""Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul""-- rock!), the album is best approached lyrics-first. It's difficult to tell who contributes what, since Perry is a poet and Boeckner penned Wolf Parade's best words.</p><p>
    As is often the case with Wolf Parade lyrics, the songs here scorn technology, ""progress,"" and urban life. ""Hate This City"" lays down the band's philosophy pretty clearly: ""We can get you anything you want/ But you won't know what it's for,"" Boeckner sings over weak static and a sickly, spare beat. Synths dance around a handful of notes to make it a sleepwalking lullaby. In ""Cannot Get, Started"", the title's comma forces a pause that acts in much the same way as the electronics on the record-- Boeckner and Perry loathe modernity, but need to make it visible in order to show you how it works. That anger sometimes fades into grudging acceptance, however-- and on ""Dead + Rural"",
    it's clear that the alternatives are just as disheartening.
    </p><p>
    Handsome Furs make sparse and minimal music, but stating an intention doesn't remove it from discussion. The album is only nine tracks long, but for all its brevity, it seems to last a while-- and even has time to repeat itself.  The album's middle section sticks to the same tempo, the guitars all use the same strident strum and texture, so by the time Boeckner sings, ""If there’s a god/ He holds you closely/ Inside these walls"" during ""Dead + Rural"", <em>Plague Park</em> itself is tightening around you, its airless, thin synths and florescent-lighting hum draining your energy. 
    </p>
<p>
    The power of Boeckner's songwriting is in its harmonic simplicity. In that way, his work is a lot like the Constantines'-- each artist wrings quite a bit out of four or so chords. Despite Boeckner's obvious talents-- he's clearly refined his songwriting gifts-- and the presence here of a worthy collaborator, Boeckner most excels when he works alongside someone who provides a stronger contrast. In Wolf Parade, Spencer Krug helps provide that balance; without Boeckner's typical foil, the results remain impressive, if not quite as compelling.

    Victims of many a lazy finger-wag for their heavy Stereolab borrowings, Electrelane have spent almost a decade refining their thick-set guitar ballads without really gaining much ground. On their latest album, <em>No Shouts, No Calls</em>, the all-female group displays a production-free grittiness that makes it sound less of this era, but closely adjacent to it.  It looks backward, disdainful of the current indie picture-- particularly England's, where buzzsaw guitars and post-Strokes poses remain bewilderingly en vogue.</p><p>
    It's a relief, then, that organ showcase ""Tram 21"" shows no ambition to
    transform the band's sound into something more immediate or trendy--
    say, shiny production, domineering vocals, or an untested instrumental
    formula. Since 2004's dark and deeply affecting <em>The Power Out</em>,
    the group has abandoned French lyrics in favor of singing in English or
    just plain keeping their mouths shut-- 2005's <em>Axes</em> was largely instrumental. On <em>No Shouts, No Calls</em>,<em> </em>the Krautrock-esque sonics of the band's last album have been fused with <em>The Power Out</em>'s flair for continental pop, but it's the guitars that sing loudest: Each of the album's tepidly sung but
    passionately orchestrated songs is a
    raucous, quietly impressive guitar overture with garnishes of
    organ and keyboard.</p><p>
    ""In Berlin"" blends four harmonies-- vocals, guitar, bass, and violin-- to craft a resolution-free dirge accompanied by nearly unintelligible lyrics. Indeed, on much of the album, the vocals work more as a separate instrument or additional melodic line than any sort of verbal communication. On ""Between the Wolf and the Dog"" the band is happy to revive its instrumental beginnings with a metal-inspired interlude, highly repetitive and stretched to epic length. It's one of the album's strongest tracks, defying structural logic with a long intro and a surprising, cheery chorus at odds with the song's frenetic, Fugazi-like sound. Ghostly vocals are a perfect addition to another torrential but hygienically precise jam session, ""Five"", but again, they serve as a tinselly bit of color, much as the strings, keyboard, or farfisa do on other tracks.</p><p>
    Oddly, a banjo makes an appearance on ""Cut and Run"", one glimmer of the band embracing new ideas. The group also embraces the cute chorus on ""Between the Wolf and the Dog"" and makes an entire beachy ballad of it: The guitars stay quiet; the dry, hollow vocals sound as if recorded in a closet; and punchy drums and tambourine obediently steer clear of the urgency displayed elsewhere. ""The Lighthouse"" is the most magical moment on this album. Its frantically circling keyboard arpeggio (the track repeats the same melody at both rapid and slow speeds) perfectly captures the band's energy, best displaying how this album-- and this group-- distinguishes itself in a stubbornly crowded field.

    So many bad things have been done to Africa
    over the years that this album cover just seems like piling on. My colleague
    Rob Mitchum remarked that Lupe Fiasco and his astral appliances must be floating
    just out of the frame. Garish as it is, with its NES Power Glove, laser-eyed
    bear, a dude eating a massive cheeseburger, and a beer cooler crushing Madagascar, the
    cover art is actually sort of a reflection of the record. There are, like, 50
    guys in this band (actually just nine, but it seems like 50 sometimes), and the
    songs are stuffed with objects in motion bound together only by grooves that
    suggest large collections of LPs from 1970s Germany.</p><p>
    If your average stoner jam band had ambition, this is the
    type of sound it might reach for-- a bit heady, suggestive of hallucinogenic
    chemicals, all over the stylistic map, and too long in several spots. An
    overabundance of length is perhaps the album's weakest point, in fact. It's
    over an hour long where a more traditional LP length might've been a better fit
    for the material. They don't hold back on giving you the extended jams,
    either: Opener ""Sufficiently Breakfast"" is a 16-minute instrumental. The bassline is a little bit Boredoms, a little
    bit Neu!, and the drums smack along deeply in the pocket. After about two
    minutes, the guitars come in, and the next five minutes are a blur of awesome
    astral jamming. It reaches a point of excess toward the end, but concludes
    marvelously with a return to the original groove.</p><p>
    A couple of tracks indicate that these guys could be a pretty
    formidable indie pop band if they chose to focus in that direction. ""That Don't
    Work That Well For Us"" turns the mob-speak of its chorus into a catchy hook by
    placing it over  the last kind of drum
    beat you'd expect in a peppy, up-beat pop tune. ""The Love of the France"" is even
    better-- it has this 80s Creation Records vibe to it, with the lightly
    filtered, fey vocals, and acoustic guitar high in the otherwise electric mix.
    It's like something the older college-aged sibling would've mixtaped for the
    younger high school-aged sibling back home in 1990, and it snuck up on me to
    become my favorite moment on the album. 
    </p>
<p>
    The album is such a widely mixed bag that it's tough to find
    a central thread to talk about. ""Whalebone"" is an eight-minute slice of cosmic
    krautrock, ""California Still Rules"" and ""101 Miles and Runnin'"" are good
    psychedelic hard rock with strong group vocals, ""Feeder Band"" is a long, New Age-y
    twiddle that for some reason reminds me of the old Simpsons Halloween episode
    where Homer falls into the third dimension. It doesn't all work, as one might
    imagine. ""Digital Shrimp"" is a bleepy, boring drag, and ""Wizard of Points""
    starts out cool with heavy drums and crazy vocoder but drags it out too far. By
    far the least forgivable song is the last one, though. ""Never Gonna Touch the
    Ground"" is a leaden, even insulting ersatz reggae track complete with
    embarrassing fake Jamaican accents-- even the way it's listed on the back cover
    makes it look tacked on. 
    </p>
<p>
    You might've noticed a lot of compound adjectives up there,
    and it's simply because there is no easy, direct way to describe what this band
    does. If they can decide what kind of band they want to be, or at least more
    fully unify their disparate elements, they'll be a force to reckon with. As it
    is, there are a handful of pretty awesome tracks on the album, and it's well
    worth checking out for people who like their rock with a touch of adventure.

For Mando Diao, <em>Ode to Ochrasy</em> predictably marks the point where these Swedish garage-rockers trade in their leathers for Nehru jackets, and tidy up the student-squat squalor of 2004's <em>Hurricane Bar</em> with some incense and expensive-looking import rugs.</p><p>
    But as evolutions go, <em>Ode to Ochrasy</em> makes for a particularly awkward adolescent phase, the sound of a band that is outgrowing their loud-fast-rules roots but still too timid to sever them completely. <em>Ode to Ochrasy</em>'s disjointed nature is reinforced by the fact that, with few exceptions, its tracklist segregates the band's two principal songwriters, Björn Dixgard (the one who sounds like Noel) and Gustaf Noren (the one who sounds like Liam), to separate sides, making it feel like two albums.</p><p>
    Side one belongs mostly to Dixgard, who seems determined to both preserve Mando Diao's Scando-Libertines rep and subvert it-- a relationship that ultimately proves irreconcilable and produces the album's most ill-advised turns. With its ""Heart Full of Soul"" fuzz riff and Jacques Brel-inspired imagery, ""Amsterdam"" signals a pronounced shift in the band's direction, but its attempts at evocative narrative are undermined by would-be clever lines that fall flat (""When I came to in Amsterdam, the hotel showed a movie/ with Marlon Brando and his friend Paciiiinooo""-- why not just say you watched <em>The Godfather</em>?) and a wannabe profound chorus (""I talked to god on the telephone/ But I really can't tell you what he told me but he was alive"") that confuses the meaningless for meaningful. And though ""Good Morning, Herr Horst"" and ""Long Before Rock 'n' Roll"" provide swift, skiffle-punk kicks, momentum is stalled by buzz-kill ballad ""Josephine"", while the acoustic title track seems emblematic of the album's wayward ambitions: a populist life-during-wartime lament framed around a made-up fantasy world of the singer's own design and comprehension.</p><p>
    So it's with considerable relief that Noren appears mid-album with ""Morning Paper Dirt"", a power-pop pick-me-up that serves as a fitting companion piece to his <em>Hurricane Bar</em> standout ""Annie's Angle"", and effectively signals his seizure of the album's reins. Though guilty of faceless student-disco fodder (""TV &amp; Me"") and the odd lyrical clunker (""I woke up on your kitchen floor with a headache made in hell""), Noren proffers a more agreeable evolution for Mando Diao's mod-rock by upping the Hammond-organ soul quotient and toning down the punk fuzz for a loose jangle: ""Song for Aberdeen"" and ""The Wildfire (If It Was True)"" are spirited, spilled-pint communions that suggest early E Street Band more than the band's usual Anglo influences. And with orchestro-ballad ""The New Boy"", he shows other retro-minded rockers that there is a future beyond rewriting the Beatles-- that is, rewriting solo Lennon. In the lawless terrain of rock'n'roll, sometimes the best move forward is not the most challenging one, but the most obvious one.</p></div>"|10251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10251-ode-to-ochrasy/|5.4|Stuart Berman

<em>A Tribute to Joni Mitchell </em>is a cobbled-together set featuring songs
    specially recorded for the occasion and a few that have been lying around for
    ages. The first thing I did when it showed up in my review queue was make my
    own version of the tribute, with Mitchell's originals side-by-side with the
    remakes. I've liked Joni Mitchell's music for a long time, but this disc has
    given me a much greater appreciation for what a great performer she was. The
    reason is pretty simple: most of the people on this compilation can't handle
    her stuff, or screw it up trying.</p><p>
    Mitchell is often lumped in with the mostly abhorrent 1970s
    singer-songwriter thing, but unlike contemporaries who emerged from the last
    wave of folk as hippiedom broke apart and sank into the cultural memory, she
    was an explorer. Even her early folk material, which is pretty musically basic,
    exhibits deep idiosyncrasies-- the way she attacked a melody doesn't really have
    a parallel, and there's an extemporaneous energy to her performances that makes
    her hard to imitate.</p><p>
    This adventurousness spilled out into the music in the mid-70s, as she
    incorporated jazz on 1974's <em>Court &amp; Spark</em> and dove in the
    avant-garde on the following year's <em>The Hissing of Summer Lawns</em>. This
    stretch of her career, extending through <em>Hejira</em> and <em>Don Juan's
    Reckless Daughter</em> to 1979's <em>Mingus</em>, is my personal favorite, and it
    accounts for a fair number of the covers included here, including all of the good
    ones. 
    </p>
<p>
    Starting with the positive, Björk's take on 1975's ""The Boho
    Dance"" is a small joy-- one of today's most unique female vocalists taking
    on one of the most unique female vocalists of the 70s. She makes the song her
    own, turning it inward with <em>Vespertine</em>-ish twinklings. Caetano Veloso's
    version of ""Dreamland"" is a perfect execution of something that makes
    total sense. The original's sparse arrangement was nothing but vocals and
    percussion, and Veloso preserves that, changing out the Afro-Caribbean track
    for an Afro-Brazilian assault. Hearing it sung by a guy who has slave ancestry
    and calls the song's Dreamland home gives even heavier weight to the images of
    Walter Raleigh and Chris Columbus walking out of the waves. 
    </p>
<p>
    Elvis Costello gets together with a woodwind ensemble to cover <em>Hissing</em>'s
    ""Edith &amp; the Kingpin"", and it has that minimalist intensity he
    does so well. For his part, Sufjan Stevens seems to be having fun leading off
    the compilation with his version of ""Free Man in Paris"", and he puts
    perhaps more imagination into his contribution than anyone else here. Even so,
    some of his moves don't work. He replaces the original flute fanfare with a
    dryly-recorded horn arrangement that sound like it's introducing a network news
    winter storm report, and the first verse is underwhelming, but he saves it by
    completely re-inventing the chorus at about twice the original tempo. Not
    competing directly with Joni pays off. 
    </p>
<p>
    Then there's the rest of it. Emmylou Harris sounds okay taking on the
    latter-day Mitchell tune ""The Magdalena Laundries"", mostly because she
    lets the song's tale of girls spirited to a convent to protect their families'
    reputations speak for itself. But Prince's take on ""A Case of You"",
    aside from being completely incongruous, is excruciating. First of all, it's
    not much of a tribute to drop the verses you don't feel like singing, but more
    importantly, the arrangement is Prince at his sappy, syrupy, high-note-milking
    worst, and it rapes the song of its import. Brad Mehldau's jazz piano interpretation
    of ""Don't Interrupt the Sorrow"" is boring in all caps, even if it
    obviously took a lot of thought. 
    </p>
<p>
    The final tier of covers is reserved for the boring, the uninspired, and the
    slavish imitations that can't match what they're imitating. James Taylor does
    ""The River"" and can't even sing the melody, K.D. Lang tries to <em>be</em>
    Joni on ""Help Me"" and fails over a limp arrangement and naff
    production, Cassandra Wilson's ""For the Roses"" is minimal to a fault,
    and her vocal barely leaves a three-note range. I'll give Sarah McLachlan
    credit for trying to do something interesting with layered vocals on
    ""Blue"", but that doesn't actually make it good. 
    </p>
<p>
    I feel like it's an indie rock cliché saying that the good tracks are by Björk,
    Sufjan, Elvis Costello and Caetano Veloso, but it's true. There's just no
    reason for a version of ""Ladies of the Canyon"", sung by Annie Lennox
    with fake koto flourishes and hideous sequenced tabla in the background, to
    exist. Listening back to the all-Joni version of the record, it's clear that
    this is a musical legacy that deserves a lot better.

    Like the Sarah Records bands they owe so much of their musical aesthetic to, Austin indie rockers Voxtrot have, up to this point, relied upon EPs and seven-inches as their preferred modes of distribution. But unlike their twee-pop predecessors, the band also enjoyed the promotional boost of the mp3, and nurturing from online music communities which allowed them to leverage their few brief releases into a contract with the Beggars Group. Now backed by an honest-to-god record deal, and with fans eagerly awaiting their next step, the band has attempted to transfer their mastery of the EP format to a full album. Unfortunately, it turns out to be something of an awkward translation.</p><p>
    During the first episode of the band's YouTube album-recording documentary ""Reaching for the Lasers"", bassist Jason Chronis admits, ""Everybody in the band was ready for things to sound more advanced. We only have three EPs out; it's funny that on our first album we feel like we have to make fairly big changes."" Thus, the extended dramatic opening and string-laden climax of ""Introduction"", which feels like the prelude to something extravagant.</p><p>
    Densely detailed, thinly produced EP tracks like ""Raised by Wolves"" and ""Mothers, Sisters, Daughters &amp; Wives"" are perfect candidates for bigger-budget expansion, and Ramesh Srivastava's songwriting style-- loquacious, emotionally insecure, buoyant, and tidy-- carries over to <em>Voxtrot</em> in full force. The ""Kid Gloves"" lyric ""cheer me up, I'm a miserable fuck"" may not halt the Smiths comparisons any time soon, but the song's propulsive power-pop backdrop suggests a well-executed fleshing-out of the sound that gained the group such a strong following. Likewise, ""Firecracker"" ascends an Arcade Fire-style bridge toward a
    satisfying, rocking chorus. Moments like these, however, are too few and far between,
    as the majority of the record's new tracks need to either be more focused or show more dynamic range.</p><p>
    Voxtrot songs tend to rely
    more on successive alterations to near-melodies than full-on excursions
    into big, transcendent melodic moments. Yet while the band continually
    strives for hugeness on their debut long-player, they opt to force the issue through instrumental layering
    and sheer volume rather than re-tooling the songs at
    the base level. ""Easy"", for example, desperately wants to gleam but is flattened and disallowed the dynamic spikes it deserves. It's far from empty ambition-- more like unrealized potential-- but the band's M.O. here makes for a frustrating listen. </p><p>
    Srivastava's singing voice-- previously an attractively coy, boyish warble-- is a big casualty here, stretched beyond its very limited range, yet still trying to express sentiments fit for a late-night phone call. His coo feels appropriate when crafting a tranquil melody on ""The Future Pt. 1"" or demurely lamenting on ""Steven"", but it struggles to keep up with harder numbers like ""Brother in Conflict"" or the cluttered closer ""Blood Red Blood"", finding itself buried in the mix. It suffers a bit of melodramatic misuse as well, most obviously on the mushy late-album slow jam ""Real Life Version"".
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, that Voxtrot failed to make a career-defining record on their first
    attempt should not be held against them-- it was simply turned around too quickly. Their internet
    celebrity has uniquely magnified their tenure and significance, and the
    resulting echo chamber of hype and anticipation has more than likely
    placed an unfair burden on them to produce a work out of frame with their
    intentions. If Chronis' above quote is an indication of the full group's
    mindset while recording, they placed similar pressure on themselves as
    well. As a result, <em>Voxtrot</em> shows a young band eagerly trying to have it
    all: attempting to establish a mature musical identity while aiming for a
    wide audience. Voxtrot may very well have a great pop record within them,
    yet their first effort stumbles from the band's enthusiastic, ambitious
    attempt to produce it immediately.

Most     recently, Britons the Pipettes broke hearts in matching costumes,     while El Perro del Mar cried Swedish tears into orchestrally fluffed pillows.     And don't forget Johnny Boy's ""You Are the Generation That Bought More     Shoes and You Get What You Deserve"". Some bands add the Velvet Underground     to the formula, whether in the sweet noise squall of the Jesus and Mary Chain     or the Concretes' misty Mazzy Starscapes.</p>
<p>When I first encountered Lucky Soul, on last year's chic indie pop     comp <i>The Kids at the Club</i>, all I     could hear was the past.

The syrupy orchestration of ""My     Brittle Heart"", the group's first single, takes from Phil Spector's     ""Wall of Sound"" not the overly familiar drum patterns, but the grand,     open-hearted directness, as huge and as potentially embarrassing as first love. ""Liberty is wasted on     me,"" sings frontwoman Ali Howard, cribbing a line from 1991 Morrissey B-side     ""I've Changed My Plea to Guilty"". Another Lucky Soul single,     ""Lips Are Unhappy"" remembers the Motown lesson on amplifying emotion by     seeming to suppress it, as Howard calls for us to ""shake, shake, shimmy,     shimmy"" (for sure!) over sunny-day tambourine and velveteen harmonies.     ""I'm tired of keeping composure when I'm not supposed to feel sad,""     she sings on ""One Kiss Don't Make a Summer"". The tracks of her tears     are easy to trace.</p>
<p>Still, <i>The Great     Unwanted</i> isn't the kind of album that leaves you walking out humming     ""Be My Baby"". Guitarist, primary songwriter, and arranger Andrew Laidlaw     pays more attention to composition than to homage, and Howard has an unshowy,     girlish voice that's nevertheless more polished than usual in indie pop, with     shades of Dusty Springfield, Sandie Shaw, and Petula Clark. She can cast a     spell over upbeat Northern Soul floorshakers like ""Getta Outta     Town!"" and bouncy     third single ""Add Your Light to Mine, Baby"". But she's just as     at home on decorous torch songs like guitar waltz ""Baby I'm     Broke"", aching finale ""The Last Song"" (with its reviewer-ready     ""the penultimate beat of the drum"") and the smoldering ""My     Darling, Anything"", which pours sugar in the singer's wounds with musical     puns about missed beats and a heart that goes ""skip-skip-skip""     like a scratched-up CD. It's the type of sumptuous bubblegum that made an     impressive showing on Pitchfork's ""<b><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/37886-the-200-greatest-songs-of-the-1960s"">The     200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s</a></b>"" but rarely places on year-end     album lists.</p>
<p>On ""The Great Unwanted"", Lucky Soul decisively align themselves with the uncool, a not uncommon move that rings true mostly due to the music's non-appetite for winks.     ""Look for us, we were the casualties/ Forever paying the price for a life     less boring,"" Howard proclaims. Elsewhere on the album, the toweringly     embellished title track from recent EP <i>Ain't     Never Been Cool</i> once again sides with the unfairly unloved. Which on one hand     could be viewed as commercially astute; the latest girl-group revival can't     last forever. Then again, that's where things get really poignant. Howard     has chosen whole-broken-heartedly to     stand among the pop-besotted, lonely souls to whom the Smiths addressed another     B-side, 1985's ""Rubber Ring""-- the huddled masses whose lives were once saved by a song. If we don't love her, who will?</p></div>"|10248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10248-the-great-unwanted/|8.0|Marc Hogan

    Ohio's C. Spencer Yeh is known for drone. (He named his record label Drone Disco, after all, and it’s far heavier on the former than the latter.) But the noise the avant-violinist bows and scrapes up on Burning Star Core's new <em>Operator Dead, Post Abandoned</em> is thick with textural variation, far more so than the steady, implacable screech of many 21st-century identikit dronesters. This is thanks to the constantly undulating layer of gritty analogue and piercing digital electronics from Yeh and bandmates Mike Shiflet and Robert Beatty, as well as the scattered percussion of drummer Trevor Tremaine. (Tremaine plays electronics too, because really, you can never have enough). In fact, the very listenable, if undeniably hairy, <em>Operator Dead</em> is the best BxC record to date, a master class in grotty, lo-fi droneology.</p><p>
    Sometimes the drones on <em>Operator Dead</em> scream until it sounds like the record's lungs are going to implode. At others, they're pretty, if not quite pastoral. (Occasionally, the band goes for both extremes on the same track.) Over the 19 minutes of opening track ""When the Tripods Came"", Yeh and crew build a resonant buzzing like a tamboura run through a distortion pedal-- you assume this is Yeh's violin, but the density of the music makes a mockery of figuring out which sound comes from which player-- that's joined by pounding, tribal drums and free flurries of cymbal by Tremaine. The electronics sound like everything from bagpipes squawking through crappy reverb to the traditional roar of psychedelic guitar fuzz. The track's opening half is actually intoxicating-- almost inviting-- but it slowly tangles into a climax of ear-bleed noise before painfully, and abruptly, shorting out.</p><p>
    The rest of <em>Operator Dead</em> feels like its aftermath. The 16-minute title track is similar to <em>Repent</em> and <em>White House</em>-era Dead C, full of sibilant scrap yard percussion and the suffocating feeling that the band has set a gasoline fire in its practice space and is slowly asphyxiating on the fumes. The album's two shorter codas are equally narcotic, especially the almost-beautiful shimmer of ""Me and My Arrow"". (But ""The Emergency Networks Are Taking Over"", which starts like a free jazz drummer sitting with the Bernard Herrmann orchestra only to finish up with the noise of a melting calliope, is also thrilling.) So Yeh knows his drones, and he also knows drones are tricky things. When you listen to a drone, you can start to hear a world of infinite texture. Or you can become bored enough listening for variations to go back to playing Wii tennis and listening to Lil Wayne. And actually, none of what Yeh does here is a strict, by-the-book ""drone""-- BxC's tracks are far too busy for that, always providing plenty to listen for--but throughout <em>Operator Dead</em>, Burning Star Core does explore the immersive capabilities of noise, the drone's capacity to ""snow you under."" The band wants to overwhelm you, and it succeeds.

There's something worth noticing there: You see the signs representing a vowel sound, but you don't say ""ahhh."" Instead, this Brooklyn band decides how you should pronounce its name, and it upsets your expectations in the process. You feel the same displacement when listening to <em>GAame </em>(no pronunciation key given), Aa's debut LP. The band employs its own secret language across the record's 13 tracks, and because the group doesn't give the listener a key, its grunts, howls, and cries become part of the rhythm of <em>GAame</em>, an album where rhythm is privileged above all.</p><p>
    Of course this remapping brings up comparisons to other rhythm-is-all, language-is-secondary bands, such as Animal Collective, Liars and OOIOO. While there is something (little-a) animal about Aa, <em>GAame</em> doesn't have the same sweaty, visceral propulsion of AC's <em>Feels</em> or the wildman roar of Liars. Instead the album is insect-like, full of seemingly chaotic rhythms that are, on closer inspection, guided by complex systems.</p><p>
    Think of <em>GAame</em> as a container for different suites, each guided by their own pacing and palette of sounds. These tracks also bleed into one another-- a feature that the iPod ruins. Opener ""Deathmask"" is <em>GAame</em>'s overture, a 30-second sampling that begins with the same eerie tension that ends the whole record. On ""Time In"", that palette is wet fingers on glass, flicking cicada wings, vespine drums that keep low to the soil. ""Best of Seven"" speaks in strident ringing school and sleigh bells. For ""New Machine"" and ""Thirteen"", Aa use synths as rhythm-- in the former they approximate chirps and chortles; they rise and fall like gentle respiration in the latter. ""Manshake"" shows the band at their best: Not just noise, not just drums, but something that reaches ecstatic, bombastic heights.
    </p><p>
    Since <em>GAame</em> works as a suite, it also suffers from being a little too cohesive. Sometimes Aa draw the connections between songs too strongly, which means the record can drag toward its end, when the listener has long been ready to drop the repetition and move on. And sometimes the vocalizations are all wrong. Take the shouted opening to ""Time In"", in which the vocalist shouts out a list of puns, including, ""You've got <em>GAame</em>."" Its micro-rhythms and elephantine horns would have been better off alone. 
    </p>
<p>
    The vocal doesn't work because cliché doesn't suit Aa's intentions. <em>GAame</em> wants to function the same way the band's name does-- as a way to control your attention by forcing the unfamiliar. So the sounds we're used to hearing disrupt an otherwise strange experience. Move into the familiar and the structure collapses.

    not so distant future where I'd be grumpily moaning about how Alan Braxe and Fred
    Falke's ""Rubicon"" had a lot to answer for, I'd have called you a crazy,
    fun-hating nut. Alas, as proof that too much of anything can make a man go
    sour, here I am, in 2007, feeling pretty much that exact way about cokey French
    electro-house, the 80s, and goddamn it, even arpeggios. To be fair, I'm not
    sure that anyone could have predicted a sudden, abundant upswing in fake cop
    show theme electro over the last three years-- not to the extent that we got
    it, anyway-- but I guess that's what happens when you spend too much time as a
    culture fixating on ""Grand Theft Auto"", ""Miami Vice"", and the relative merits of Giorgio Moroder.</p><p>
    Thankfully, we're in the hangover stage of that particular long weekend, which
    means that not only is France's Kavinsky at the wrong party, he's late to it.
    The followup EP to 2006's <em>Teddy Boy</em>, <em>1986</em>
    is at once indebted to Braxe's early work and yet somehow utterly impervious to
    it. As pure homage goes, Kavinsky's sounds are dead on, his structures work, his
    chord changes feel right, but, ultimately, there's no blood here. It's how most miniature
    movements end, really; eventually something comes along that has all the
    on-paper characteristics of the original thing and absolutely none of its joy. This
    is that.</p><p>
    In what I guess is meant to be a cute thematic quirk, <em>1986 </em>is a mini
    sorta-concept EP about...driving. With its comic book depiction of a drug
    cartel-type wearing a racing jacket and driver's gloves, the album artwork
    hints at the video game-reinforcing theme. Those who bother to dig deeper into
    the ""back story"" will be thumped over the nose with a silly tale about how 1986
    was the year Kavinsky crashed his Ferrari Testarossa, only to come back as a
    zombie hell bent on...what, it never says. Haunting a dead horse?</p><p>
    That all the song titles sound like driving games doesn't help to
    disabuse us of the notion that Kavinsky made most of these tracks in between
    serious face time with his PS2. There's ""Wayfarer"", ""Grand Canyon"", ""Dead
    Cruiser"", the pointlessly expository ""Flashback"" (which advances the car
    crash storyline with a 90-second skit featuring news reports, police sirens, and
    what sounds like a lost soundtrack to a body magic fitness tape) and, just for
    good measure, a SebastiAn remix of 2006's ""Testarossa Overdrive"". With the possible
    exception of ""Grand Canyon"", which has a nice shimmer to it, none of them feel
    particularly essential; what they might do is make you pine a bit for the days
    when Braxe and Vitalic and Daft Punk were doing this sort of thing with style. A
    craven attempt to dine out on the last remaining scraps of appeal for this
    particular strand of French house, <em>1986</em>
    is a bloodless miss; less Jan Hammer,
    more nail in the coffin.</p></div>"|10173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10173-1986-ep/|4.0|Mark Pytlik

Dance sets poppy enough to beg constant repetition. Fun songs     about love. Love songs about fun. These are just some of the reasons why Hot     Chip may be the closest thing we have to an indie music Switzerland. Different     factions  may try to claim them as their own, but the London electro-pop     quintet has managed to remain largely nondiscriminatory with their output. It's so-called ""poptimism"" of the best kind: Hot Chip's answer to every genre always seems     to be a resounding, open-armed ""yes.""</p>
<p>Spanning blue-eyed soul, synthpop, r&amp;b,<span> </span>and geek-rock, Hot Chip's musical hybrid is a lovable (if unlikely) one-- and, mostly for utilitarian reasons, it's not one you'd expect them to clearly communicate during the course of a single-CD mix. Nonetheless,     that's exactly what they do with their entry in !K7's acclaimed <i>DJ Kicks</i> series. A mulched-up whirlwind of pretty much everything they hold near     and dear, the disc darts through drivetime FM soul, goofy techno, cartoonish fun, and big synthpop moments, taking the best few minutes (or in some cases, few <i>seconds</i>) of each of these 24 tracks and cramming it all into a breakneck 68 minutes.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, the only way anyone     could ever pull this off would be to cop to a bit of A.D.D., so <i>DJ Kicks</i> flits excitedly and     unapologetically from one listening station to the next. Amidst the madness,     though, there is a vague sense of order in the form of four loosely defined     acts: a) The goofy party stuff, b) The retro block, c) The techno half-hour,     and d) The closing free-for-all. It's a structure that basically mimics that     of their more substantial live DJ sets, albeit on a much more condensed scale.</p>
<p>Hot Chip's occasional proximity to yacht rock has been     well-documented, and it's a sound they good-naturedly embrace here by     bookending their mix with two derivatives; first, the opening ballad ""Nitemoves"",     courtesy of new act Grovesnor (aka former Hot Chip drummer Rob Smoughton),     which starts with a WKRP-ready palette of Rhodes piano and blue eyed vox before     sputtering into a mess of programmed drums and synth squibbles; later,     Joe Jackson's ""Steppin' Out"", which they show deference to by playing out in     full. There's also pinches of hip-hop here and there, such as a quick verse     from Positive K's 1992 hit ""I Got a Man"" and current Baltimore phenom     Young Leek's ""Jiggle It"". That the latter is preceded by New Order's ""Bizarre     Love Triangle"" and followed by Etta James' ""In the Basement"" should clue you in     to what you're in for. This is fun by the minute-- no buildup, all payoff, but     happily, it works.</p>
<p>The mini techno set in the latter half of the mix provides a     bit of room to breathe, and gives Hot Chip a chance to acquit themselves as     guys who are just as capable of spinning at five a.m. as midnight. Selections from     Dominik Eulberg, Gabriel Ananda, and Marek Bois all stand out, but it's Noze's off-kilter     ""Love Affair"" that has the last laugh, melding a tight, clattering groove with     an English lyric made charming by the French accents singing it: ""I wash my fit     and I feel so good/ I brush my tiff and I feel so good/ I clean my nose and I'm     ready for my love affair/ For my love affair!"" A beguiling mix of technical precision,     fun pop, and dumb humor, it's the one track on the mix you suspect Hot Chip probably     feel closest to.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, the reason this works so well     is because Hot Chip never seem <i>too</i> close to any of the music presented; there's a nice democracy to the way this stuff's     been blenderized to a neon pulp. It provides the sense that they're too busy rummaging     through their record bags for the next big moment to worry all that much about things     like pace and structure. Turn yourself over to those moments for an hour, and you     won't end up worrying much about anything at all.</p></div>"|10250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10250-dj-kicks/|8.0|Mark Pytlik

    Black Moth Super Rainbow apparently consists of a few pals with
    funny nicknames like Tobacco and Father Hummingbird, who dress strangely,
    occasionally wear masks, and make music together off in some isolated rural area near Pittsburgh. It all sounds suspiciously engineered to cultivate an image for the band as eccentric pop outsiders. Fortunately, the backstory
    doesn't matter much, because the first thing to do with a record like
    BMSR's latest, <em>Dandelion Gum</em>, is to forget about who made it: The music discourages any engagement with personality. For one thing, the album's vocals are warped beyond repair by vocoder, even when its tracks occasionally veer toward
    a mutant electronic version of sun-drenched folk-pop. Most of the time, you can't
    understand a thing being said, but here, that's not a problem: The meaning of the
    music comes through regardless.</p><p>
    As a band, Black Moth Super Rainbow, have been toiling away for a few years now,
    amassing several full-lengths, CD-Rs, and collaborations, most notably
    a 2006 split EP with the Octopus Project. But where the group's earlier records, when not traveling a purely instrumental path, incorporated more or less ""regular"" singing, <em>Dandelion Gum</em> takes a big risk: It relies on a single vocal filter throughout the course of the entire album. Typically, a processed voice so readily becomes the focus of a song that, without at least <em>some</em> change to the effect, a full record can seem samey or redundant. Luckily, Black Moth have an unusual enough mood going
    here that the uniformity becomes a strength. The vocals are playful but not
    played for laughs; to me they sound claustrophobic, almost sickly.
    It's not a voice that brings shiny singing robots to mind, but rather
    people who've spent so much time indoors that their bodies have begun to
    change in unhealthy ways. To that end, the vocoder gives the record a shade of darkness it
    wouldn't otherwise have.</p><p>
    The keyboards throughout sound vintage, with textures
    that bring to mind Mellotron and Moog, while the guitars are thin, trebly, and
    speckled with analog dust. The central pulsating riff of ""Sun Lips""
    sounds an awful lot like the dream-channeled refrain of ""Strawberry Fields
    Forever"", even as it's used in service of what is ultimately a
    tremendously simple little pop tune. ""We miss you in summertime,"" the
    singer (that would be Tobacco on the mic) intones through his machine, and
    since it seems kind of like a love song, the presence of ""we"" is a
    little odd. Does he have a mouse in his pocket? Maybe it's one of those songs that
    seems directed to a woman but is really about weed. Somehow, though, it works. Chalk it up to the world of this album. 
    </p>
<p>
    If much of <em>Dandelion Gum</em> sounds like something
    recorded at home on the cheap, ""Rollerdisco"", which forms an
    impressive 1-2 punch after ""Sun Lips"", demonstrates that Black Moth gets the
    most out of their modest set-up. Like much of their past work, it comes over like a spry, airy, and tremendously
    evocative instrumental Boards of Canada interlude, from back when the Scottish duo
    still did that sort of thing. And the acoustic guitar loop in
    ""Jump Into My Mouth and Breathe the Stardust"" has the old-tape-found-under-a-tree-stump vibe that gave BoC's <em>The Campfire Headphase</em> an appealing sense of water-damaged
    psychedelia. Early Beck is even invoked on ""Melt Me"", which
    sounds an awful lot like what ""Devil's Haircut"" would have been had
    Carl Stephenson helped lay it down for <em>Mellow Gold</em>. Still, despite the
    occasionally folky melodic sensibility, Black Moth's aesthetic is always
    spacey-- they're more likely to be scoring a laser show at a planetarium than
    busking on a street corner. 
    </p>
<p>
    Wherever these guys are holed up and whether or not
    they really call the drummer Iffernaut, <em>Dandelion Gum </em>is a nice surprise
    and a good example of why doing one thing very well is sometimes more than enough.

    With <em>Mapmaker</em>, Parts
    &amp; Labor display a newfound matur-- wait, come back! I know what
    you're thinking. ""Maturity"" means new heights for some, and a
    slower and duller version of the same for most. For noiseniks
    like Parts &amp; Labor-- a band that wears its hardcore roots on its
    sleeves-- maturity would likely mean the latter. I wouldn't blame
    anyone who read that and immediately thought of all the
    <em>Sandinista!</em>s and <em>Candy Apple Grey</em>s
    crowding the used bins of record stores worldwide. P&amp;L have the same members as on last
    year's <em>Stay Afraid</em>, as well as the same basic sound: uptempo noise
    punk with the irrepressible drums of Chris Weingarten, blurting and
    squealing keyboards to replace guitars, and the vocals always set to
    a strident, monotone bellow. However, <em>Mapmaker</em>
    does everything else it can to diversify their sound without
    sacrificing the winning formula they've established.</p><p>
    On paper, these new flourishes are
    signals of a band that's probably spinning its wheels: horn
    sections, more vocal harmonies, more open space, more slow songs... but bear with me. <em>Stay Afraid</em> wasn't just
    exhilarating, it was exhausting and bordered on uncomfortable in its
    relentlessly treble-heavy attack. A little open space does wonders
    for the band, especially on tracks like ""Ghosts Will Burn"",
    where the death rattle of a cheap keyboard precedes vicious stabs of
    distorted bass and a precise drum beat that murders the fourth bar
    while letting an ominous air fill the other three. Plenty of
    inadvisable influences killed punk bands, but a little bit of funk
    never hurt. ""The Gold We're Digging"" adds a bit of rave-era rhythm to
    its sober sloganeering, and ""Long Way Down"" is makes more
    stunning use of space with firing-line percussion and ringing high
    notes that nearly falls apart before rising up in a wave of cacaphony
    and thundering low-end.</p><p>
    The growth extends to second vocalist
    BJ Warshaw, whose ""Brighter Days"" is his best spotlight track
    thus far, unaccompanied vocals juxtaposed with rhythmless noise
    interludes, all grounded by the album's most  calculated melody.
    Elsewhere, the dominating textures on ""Fake Rain"" and ""New
    Crimes"" are their nimble clean guitar lines. Even the more obvious dynamic tricks, like the
    disorienting attack-and-retreat of ""Camera Shy"" or the simmering
    tension of ""Unexplosions"", still have plenty of mileage when in their hands. As for those horns, opening track ""Fractured
    Skies"" tucks them into a final gasp on its gargantuan final chorus,
    spending every moment of its frenetic drumming and counterpoint
    keyboard squeals building up to that one moment-- they know you gotta
    earn those horns, and they do.
    </p>
<p>
    The band didn't need to grow up in any way, especially as it's only been a year between releases. Regardless, Parts &amp; Labor took cues from their
    forebears and tried their hand at a more diverse record without
    losing the thread, leaving the more wildly experimental work for
    their tour EPs and pushing at the walls of the box they established
    with <em>Stay Afraid</em>. By now, we know there doesn't

    Villalobos' <em>Alcachofa</em> or
    Daft Punk's <em>Human After All</em>, the impact of Âme's hypnotic 2005 anthem ""Rej"" has been delayed; 18 months or so after its release,
    dance music is beginning to respond with a swathe of club tracks that recast
    the space between deep house and minimal as that between orchestration and
    Steve Reich chime-loops (hello, Henrik Schwarz). You might expect Âme's debut
    DJ mix <em>…Mixing</em> to
    speak to this development (""where is Rej?"" asks the tongue-in-cheek sticker on
    the front of the CD, presumably so that I don't have to), but instead it talks
    around it, weaving a constellation of influences and reference points that
    almost too-perfectly circumscribe Âme's sound-- too-perfect, because the result
    sometimes feels a bit like a list of ingredients rather than the finished
    product.</p><p>
    Perhaps because Âme's
    current sound tends toward the monolithic, the gentle eclecticism on display
    here struggles to startle: Âme's penchant for moody hippy disco, lush vocal
    garage, dreamy tech-house, scaly minimal and nervous Detroit techno seems so reasonable, it's hard to imagine that this could result in
    efforts as disorienting as ""Rej"" or the recent ""Fiori"". But reasonability isn't the
    worst thing you could accuse a DJ mix of, and one of the pleasures of <em>…Mixing</em>
    is precisely how logical
    and familiar Âme's aesthetic seems-- even the unashamedly pretentious use of
    Tangerine Dream-style synthesizer epics to open and close the mix seems
    cheerfully appropriate.
    For people who
    look to dance music for sonic revolutions, the album's appeal will be limited. The sound of this music-- clean but amorphous, accomplished but not complicated, existing in a space
    where acoustic and electronic sounds merge and become indistinguishable-- gestures towards a sense of timelessness that usually prevents it from sounding
    futuristic, or even retro-futurist. At its most intoxicating-- the gorgeously
    soporific disco of Double's ""Woman of the World"", the orchestral grandeur of
    Henrik Schwarz's remix of Coldcut's ""Walk a Mile in my Shoes"", the bruised
    atmospherics of Atjazz's ""For Real (Version Remix)"" or the existential diva
    echoes of Ben Westbeech's ""So Good Today (Yoruba Soul Mix)""-- the sensation is
    perhaps rather that of a future of damaged dancers looking back to the past for
    shelter and succor; the utopian or dystopian resonances of this music are
    given shape insofar as they excluded from the frame.</p><p>
    Perhaps best of
    all is Carl Craig's 12-year-old remix of Jonny L's ""This Time"", in which a
    female diva's declaration, ""there's no need to climb the mountains high"", is
    looped into an ominous ""high-igh-igh-igh"", while the jazz-house groove builds
    to a seemingly infinite plateau of intensity. At once luxuriant and slightly
    unnerving, the track exposes a darkness at the heart of opulence, the
    ""timelessness"" of the music now an eerie sign that the embodied world has
    fallen away, leaving no path back to reality. At these moments the mix comes
    closest to capturing the mystical feel-- if not the specific sound-- of ""Rej"",
    which repeats its haunting motif to the point of monomaniacal delirium, a
    soundtrack to some arcane pagan rite.
    </p><p>
    ""Mystical"" is not
    a vibe that deep house has had much truck with historically. ""Soulful,"" yes,
    even ""spiritual,"" but the voluptuous warmth of the music has usually been
    immersive rather than overwhelming, beguiling rather than bewitching. In its
    decision to cover so much historical and stylistic ground rather than burrow
    deeper into this as yet still under-explored aesthetic, <em>…Mixing</em> can feel like a bit of a missed
    opportunity; compared to recent efforts from Âme's labelmate and occasional
    collaborator Dixon, it doesn't go deep enough. Still, as an introductory biography on how the duo
    got to this point, it succeeds admirably. Let's just hope they have a sequel
    planned.

The mind-blowing unknown opening act is a familiar enough trope, but the then-Philadelphia band's set didn't blow me away so much as gently but firmly guide me into the their corner.  Playing first of three at a big club can be daunting, and sure enough the band performed to an almost-deserted Bowery Ballroom without the benefit of a soundcheck.  And yet, they pulled off a surprisingly solid set with just the right balance of eagerness and gentle self-deprecation.  Too much self-awareness can kill a young band's appeal and leave genuine charisma reeking of transparent manipulation, and it was refreshing to see a band that seemed so at ease, especially given the circumstances of the show.</p><p>
    Nearly four years later, a similar sense of ease permeates the band's debut, <em>Flight of the Bass Delegate</em>.  The album has its fair share of genre-hopping, but never in a way that seems obnoxiously cool or haphazardly referential.  If anything, the dub and reggae nods on <em>Flight of the Bass Delegate</em> come off as...kinda dorky.  The Jai-Alai Savant are not dabblers, and they follow through some of these stylistic cues with an aplomb that at can be both disarming and distracting.</p><p>
    The brief introductory track ""Data Massagana"" is both justified and obliterated by the unstoppable, explosive ""Arcane Theories"".  Here, the band's pop and post-punk sensibilities come to the fore; ""Arcane Theories"" pairs the unrelenting muscle of a Fugazi song with massive, sun-soaked harmonies.  It's pop music based in rhythm, not melody-- singer Ralph Darden doesn't have much of a range, and many of his melodies don't extend beyond four or five notes.  But his short, repetitive harmonized vocal phrases make for an integral and memorable part of the album's overall feel.</p><p>
    The best moments on <em>Flight</em> are generally the most intense and concise. Again, this is not a band that drops aesthetic signifiers and then moves on; they commit, and sometimes they'll chase a groove a little too far. ""Scarlett Johansson, Why Don't You Love Me?"" adds just a bit of reggae syncopation to the band's propulsive sound, to great effect.  The seven minute-plus ""The Low Frequent See""-- the title of which should put to rest any questions regarding the band's nerddom-- finds its way to a number of cool sounds and interesting instrumental moments, but such explorations almost always seem to come at the expense of focused songcraft.</p><p>
    Still, this is the age of shuffle, and there are some kind of unbelievably ass-kicking tracks to be found here.  And, even when the band meanders, they do so whole-heartedly. Though it was long in the making, this is still their first release, and it certainly isn't short on good reasons to keep paying attention. <em>Flight of the Bass Delegate</em> has some very good stylistic ideas and some very good songs, even if they don't always happen at the same time.  </p></div>"|10237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10237-flight-of-the-bass-delegate/|6.5|Matt LeMay

<p>Malcolm Gladwell     groupies can tell you all about ""connectors,"" roaming     person-to-person hubs that link disparate corners of society. Well, in the late     1960s, Betty Davis-- then Betty Mabry-- was the link connecting such luminaries     as Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone and Miles Davis, the latter ultimately contributing     his last name through a relatively short but tumultuous marriage.     His 1968 album <i>Filles     de Kilimanjaro</i> features then-model Betty on the cover; the track     ""Mademoiselle Mabry"" was inspired by her.</p>
<p>As legend has it,     Miles grew jealous of Betty's friendship with Hendrix (which Miles allegedly     suspected may have been more than that), but Betty's place in the middle of     this intersection of geniuses apparently resulted in more than just divorce     filings. By popular account, it was Betty who turned Miles on to Sly and Jimi,     which in turn may have been the catalyst for Miles' most radical musical     evolution: the still awe-inspiring <i>Bitches Brew</i>, released in 1970, a     year after his separation from Betty.</p>
<p>Betty Davis' own     response was her self-titled 1973 debut, a groundbreaking slab of funk that     featured a huge hunk of the Family Stone (it was produced by drummer Greg     Errico) and fused soul, sex, and hard rock like the best Sly or Funkadelic     disc, albeit from a female perspective. But if George Clinton waved his freak     flag proudly, Betty Davis wore it as underwear then rubbed your face in it. An     oft-quoted passage in Miles Davis' autobiography gets it just right: ""If     Betty were singing today she be something like Madonna, something like Prince,     only as a woman,"" wrote Davis back in 1989. ""She was the beginning of     all that when she was singing as Betty Davis.""</p>
<p>No doubt. <i>Betty     Davis</i> never gives up in its aim to seduce and destroy; songs like ""If     I'm In Luck I Might Get Picked Up"", ""Ooh Yeah"", and ""Game     is My Middle Name"" are raw and relentless in their intent. Then-Afrophile     nympho Brian Eno might have called it <i>Music for Fucking</i>, though the     semi-classic ""Anti Love Song"" is music for fucking <i>with</i>,     specifically fucking with a former lover many suspect is Miles, but who might     as well be any man stupid enough to do Betty wrong (in every sense).</p>
<p>Davis' part     banshee/part Amazon shriek isn't the smoothest delivery system for seduction,     but it does get the point across. Supposedly it was Marc Bolan who encouraged     Davis to write her own songs, and there's no question Davis understood the best     way for her to perform them was to wail like she was about to bite someone's     head off.</p>
<p>As underscored by     Oliver Wang's informative liner notes (drawn in part from one of the only     interviews Davis has consented to in the last several decades), Davis'     ever-growing sense of empowerment played a part in her decision to self-produce     her 1974 record, <i>They Say I'm Different</i>. While the self-titled disc's     band (which also included Neal Schon on guitar and future disco queen Sylvester     on backing vocals) was dissolved, the sound remained mostly the same, and     Davis' outré sexuality just as out there.</p>
<p>On ""He Was a Big     Freak"", she essentially spars with a lover over who is freakier: the     whipped or the whip-wielder. ""Git In There"" is house party in     progress. The defensive title track finds Davis casting herself against her     grandfather's more traditional blues favorites, while ""Don't Call Her No     Tramp"" makes a distinction between an ""elegant hustler"" and a     hooker (according to Wang, the song drew the ire of the NAACP for its     ""demeaning"" depiction of black women). It's a slightly slicker album     than its predecessor, but no less unreserved.</p>
<p>Yet despite the fact     that these albums drip with personality, Betty Davis remains something of an     enigma. Her catalog (including a short but confusing and uneven string of     follow-ups to <i>They Say I'm Different</i>) have gone in and out of print over     the years, while the singer herself is reportedly living in Pittsburgh, broke,     bemused but largely ignoring the attention her brief career continues to     garner.</p>
<p>And no wonder: Light in the     Attic claims Davis never received any royalties from previous releases. Without     steady checks coming in, what's cult fame even worth? Better to just keep on     keeping on and let other folks parse out the legacy, but hopefully these     reissues will remedy the situation.

    Dungen took longer to catch on than your average overnight sensation. In 2004, momentarily existing outside the micro-managed Web 2.0 landscape, the band shouted a hearty Swedish ""surprise"" with their excellent <em>Ta Det Lugnt</em>.  It may have been the language barrier-- or the fact that the collection was released by Subliminal Sounds, a smallish Stockholm-based label known as much for its exotica/cocktail bent as for its underground psych fetish-- but the group seemed to come out of nowhere, with little advance word or ground-level buzz.</p><p>
    Of course, we're talking stateside reception. At home in Sweden, they'd already undergone a post-major label backlash (and, after flourishing elsewhere, a sheepish critical rebirth). Since those days of relative anonymity, though, Dungen have toured extensively as a four-piece, reissued and reconfigured older material, and connected with the New York-based Kemado label, who in 2005 issued a super-sized <em>Ta Det Lugnt</em>.  Despite the flurry, Dungen's reputation still rests on that one gem of a record in its original, slimmer state: The early material wasn't that great, and the extras included on the deluxe edition felt gratuitous.</p><p>
    Now, three years after that album's first release, Dungen has issued <em>Tio Bitar</em>, album number four.  Worth the wait? Well, bad news first: There's no ""Panda"". But then, it's a different, imperfect monster: <em>Tio Bitar</em> explores the mellower side of psychedelia, working
    largely as the dusk-backdropped counterpoint to the band's earlier
    fireworks. Dungen mastermind Gustav Ejstes has spent the past few years studying
    fiddle with a Swedish master,
    and while it adds another distinctive layer to the group's
    distinguished sound, its omnipresence lends the album a decidedly
    different feel. Perhaps the album's strangest attribute, though, is how even a
    few of
    the best songs here-- excluding, of course, tracks like ""Gör
    Det Nu"" or ""Du Ska Inte Tro Att Det Ordnar Sig"", on which the band unequivocally succeeds-- come off as something gorgeous in the
    background, rather than the in-your-hair, fist-pumping rockers Dungen seems to have intended.
    </p>
<p>
    The record opens extraordinarily with ""Intro"", a fried stage-setting
    rocker that massages one of guitarist Reine Fiske's majestically distended,
    havoc-wreaking
    guitar lines (and extended chords) through repeating flutes and
    busybody drums. As counterpoint, the next track,
    ""Familj"",
    is pleasantly airy, an afternoon Dungen pastoral that could go on
    forever. Then, the band summons stormclouds with the blustery, thundering ""Gör Det Nu"", echoing ""Intro"" in sheer fret magick, and shredding off any remembrance of its golden-skied predecessor.
    </p>
<p>
    But, perhaps acknowledged by its title (<em>Tio Bitar</em>
    translates as ""10 Pieces""), the album doesn't always congeal. One song
    may uncharacteristically plod while the next overreaches. Most of its
    tracks are brief-- six clock in under four minutes, one above eight-- but while the tracks weren't much longer on
    <em>Ta Det Lugnt, </em>they all <em>felt</em> titanic. Granted, <em>Tio Bitar</em>'s
    aesthetic pull aims for somewhat different horizons than the last album's
    larger, more energized sound, but-- tough love, guys, tough love-- where even <em>Ta Da Lugnt</em>'s verdant
    instrumentals hooked talons into you, a few of these suites slide past
    like water off a duck's back.
    </p>
<p>
    Instrumentally, of course, the album is airtight. Its loose, colorful sunbursts of bright fiddle,
    guitar, organs, drums, tambourines, and flute find the band perhaps at their most technically proficient to date. In promotional material, we're
    reminded Dungen is basically the omni-instrumental Ejstes accompanied
    by guitar ace Reine Fiske, and here, Fiske's leads are the stars: Despite the band's overall move toward a quieter gentleness, his guitars cook with a unrestrained, Hendrixian sizzle. The drums, too, have their colossal moments-- especially when twisting out
    seismic rolls on ""Svart Är Himlen"". (Who's the more fun
    multi-instrumental drummer, Mascis or Ejstes?)
    </p>
<p>
    Still, chops alone can't salvage the midtempo ""Ett Skäl Att Trivas"", which sounds and feels like Dungen, but, with its lifeless drums and soporific bassline, bores very much unlike Dungen. Or, the one gigantic track,
    ""Mon Amour"", which recedes into extended soloing, forgoing the band's usual, admirable restraint for the kind of hippie self-indulgence they've always managed to transcend. Even given these disappointments, though, the record is far from a dramatic departure from the band's previous outings-- you'd certainly never mistake it for another band-- and its few missteps are well balanced by a handful of blissful, seismic bright pockets. Just be ready for its late-afternoon haze: Leave your acid on the porch and grab the bong instead.

There's the band's sincere initiative to start a sanctuary for primates, and the quotes DeGraw's given this site-- he imagines that gorillas ""look at what we have done, how we have fucked up so many pure and beautiful things, and they just all make a pact to stay somewhat primitive, to keep existing in a more natural state. They sit back and laugh amongst themselves at the ridiculous things that humans do."" DeGraw hints at an easy metaphor-- GGD as Macy's Day Parade floating ape, New York's backyard naturalists.  And yet, far from primitive or pure, Gang Gang Dance are some of the city's most savvy editors, imposing order while making it look like chaos.</p><p>
    They do love their mythology.  The gorilla talk is another decoy in a long string of dodges, joining the guerilla art and Ghostface T-shirts and their frontwoman's rough-edged sex appeal as ways of understanding the band when deeper understandings are slow to come.  Given how fragmented and harsh their sound sources are, and how unwilling their records are to betray the fact that their music does in fact live and thrive on rhythm, it's no surprise people often take them at their word.</p><p>
    The long-delayed <em>Retina Riddim</em> began as a film project.  Using the band's past records, practices, and live performances as source material, DeGraw matched video to audio; <em>Retina</em> is, like Panda Bear's recent <em>Person Pitch</em>, a synthetic collage masquerading as an organic outburst. GGD have always cultivated the rhythmic potential in virtually everything at hand.  The difference here is minor, loops and samples standing in for live and spontaneous edits.</p><p>
    Split in its final incarnation over a DVD and CD, <em>Retina</em> is the natural result of years of careful attention by the band to the smallest aspects of their own sound.  At the outset of ""Retina Riddim"", an old-world violin pings around, each scrape and incidental ricochet looped and layered.  Something hollow falling to the ground provides a beat.  Liz Bougatsos's distorted chanting swirls up, new chimes and violin registers following behind it.  An air-horn sounds, a baby chuckles-- at one point, what sounds like a gunshot cues up a disco charge, gabber by way of the subway or the sewer.</p><p>
    GGD share a common approach with Panda Bear and his Animal Collective bros but unlike that sector of their cheerful lite-noise brethren, choose sample sources as ugly and jarring as possible.  This can hide how sophisticated their compositions are.  <em>Retina Riddim</em> is probably one of the year's only records that could handle a bit of a comparison to Proust-small things, memories, snatches of sound and sensation recur again and again.  Time passes but it's not a linear time. </p><p>
    Somehow it's hard to like the DVD as much-something about literalizing the audio.  There are kaleidoscopes.  The screen bifurcates, fractalizes.  There are ocean shots and shots of Bougatsos outdoors. The footage is sharp-- for instance, the chopped and looped live performance towards the end is such a good representation of what you're hearing you can't help but laugh - but there's more to what they're doing than the DVD's all too literal smoke and mirrors.  Even monkeys know not to mess with a good thing.</p></div>"|10241.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10241-retina-riddim/|7.5|Zach Baron

    Titan is a Brooklyn quartet into excavating late-1960s/early-70s progressive
    psychedelia. Along with mostly instrumental incense burners comes attendant
    throwback imagery-- note the suitable-for-black-light mushroom and freehand
    lettering that melts across the CD's inner flaps-- and long titles to match
    reasonably lengthy songs. Really, no need to dig further than the title, <em>A
    Raining Sun of Light and Love For You and You and You</em>, to find those ingredients displayed.</p><p>
    To get a good sense of the sound of the four atmospherically analog boogie
    bongs on Titan's first non-CD-R studio recording project, skim the
    instrumentation listed at the band's MySpace page. Adding some DayGlo flesh to
    the drums, guitar, and Fender Jazz bass are a parade of synthesizers and
    pedals. It's the sorta stuff that makes kids who've never heard Hawkwind or
    Amon Düül II yell, ""Hawkwind and Amon Düül II!"" (sometimes adding Ash
    Ra Tempel because it appears on the label's cover sticker).</p><p>
    In my teens I went through a severe psych era, aided by walks to the
    now-defunct Sound On Sound records in Highland Park, NJ and hitched rides to
    the Princeton Record Exchange. At that time, anything even slightly swirly,
    extended, or stinking of pot (or Wayne Rogers) was purchased. As a result, I have the record collection of a geeky senior citizen,
    including hundreds of albums from the period Titan loves as well as post-70s
    players who've shared that fixation. Closing my eyes, opening my ears, and
    placing <em>A Raining Sun of Light</em> in that context, I'd say it lands
    somewhere in the lower middle of the other revivalists.
    </p>
<p>
    Which is too bad. The record actually begins more than promisingly. At the
    onset, ""Annals of the Former World""'s out-of-phase, pseudo-sacred
    vocals and pastoral acoustic guitar warp into a tripped Can freak-out in the
    course of ten truly compelling minutes. It's a beaut. Or fast-forward to the
    album's final seconds when the acoustic spire returns after the sounds of
    crickets and a truck, a tinny micro-jamboree from outer nowhere. What happens
    in between?
    </p>
<p>
    There are other successful turns of phase, but across 42 minutes of Comets on
    Fire on Acid echo rides, projectile Neu! vomits, flanged crescendos, and some
    right pretty guitars (respect), an uninspired sameness eclipses the
    proficiency. Ultimately it's the less polished, odd rumblings that stay with
    you, start to feel like a tease beneath the weight of a too-well-oiled
    juggernaut. The players are obviously compatible and technically astute, but on
    the whole the collection isn't specific or individual (or warped or weird)
    enough to inspire return trips. Dudes need to spring more leaks.

    It's a maxim among many who think about such things that no new technologies are ever really ""new,"" but are hybrids and re-conceptions of pre-existing modes of doing similar things.  For its part, the record album, despite the second term's indication of a collection of disparate works, has never shaken its association with the narrative format, where songs are chapters and musicians storytellers.  As actual works of literary art, concept albums tend to approach the idea of ""story"" rather loosely, a function of the obvious fact that songs have nothing on words as tale-creators.  Perhaps then, the Gainesville power-pop band Morningbell is on to something with <em>Through the Belly of the Sea</em>, which they've styled after that most nonlinear of the fictional arts, the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books.</p><p>
    Even aside from the music, then, <em>Belly</em> sits at a rarified, if not necessarily sought-after, level of indie rock ironic nostalgia, by combining the classic rock-ness of the concept album with the dime-store novelty of the Bantam book series. The trick to the album is simple, and seems like a fun idea; you read the liner notes while listening, and after each track you are given two choices as to your next move. Relax on the coral reef? Fight the mysterious sea monster? The world is yours.  For a lot of people, shuffling music around is a daily activity, so <em>Belly</em>'s batshitness is of a much lesser conceptual realization than that of, say, <em>Zaireeka</em>.  But in a way, this is the most compelling aspect of Morningbell's gimmick; its regressive approach toward listening technology, limiting iTunes' infinite-choice power to but two post-song options. Along that line, perhaps a good idea to market the CDs might be a slogan like one from the back of a comic book: ""Magically Transform iTunes Into a Paperback!""</p><p>
    The record as either music or narrative, however, does little more than tread water. The tale told is of some sort of vague oceanic exploration, and it becomes quickly clear that the songs, for the most part, have little to do with adventure or science fiction. Reading the half-paragraphs that carry the story forward takes about 15 seconds each, after which the waiting game starts for something exciting to happen in the song, which invariably does not. Opening track ""The Speed of God"" is impassive keyboard pop-as-expedition-launch, which leads to, without option, to a brief interlude on track seven. I read during this song that a JOLT!!! happens as my ship is attacked by a sea monster, but the music-- which aims for <em>The Life Aquatic</em> but lands somewhere in a Krofft Brothers interstitial-- is indifferent. I decide to ""flee,"" and end up ""Lost Again"", before opting to watch an octopus walk across some coral, both excursions set to slight mid-tempo indie pop.</p><p>
    I'll stop short of recommending a Rick Wakeman or Jethro Tull degree of
    nutty orchestration for an album with this set-up, but Morningbell's
    anonymous, aqueous Shinsiness is much too thin for the fantastic voyage
    they seem to have in mind. That <em>Belly</em> could be listened to in its published running order without any huge change in effect is a testament to either the universality of its lyrics (hope, fear, going home, etc.), or the more likely explanation that the Choose Your Own Adventure idea is, well, a rather thorough publicity gimmick. Morningbell's real breakthrough with <em>Belly</em>, then, instead of any adventurous narrative novelty, is its unique way to gain notice for otherwise timid music.<br/>

    Among critics and fans, the
    National's third album <em>Alligator</em> has
    become synonymous with the term <em>grower</em>.
    Released to minor acclaim early in 2005, the album has since quietly and steadily built
    up a large, avid listenership. Matt Berninger's
    lyrics-- initially off-putting and seemingly obtuse in their non sequiturs and
    stray details-- proved unpretentiously poetic over time. His sober
    baritone and dogged repetition of phrases and passages made it sound like he
    was trying to figure the songs out in tandem with the listener. The band, meanwhile, played around the hooks instead of hard-selling them, so that in a
    sense, despite two previous albums and a killer EP, we all pretty much learned
    how to listen to the National on <em>Alligator</em>,
    eventually finding deeper shades of meanings in the words, sympathizing with
    Berninger's anxieties, laughing at his grim jokes, and tapping out the band's
    complex rhythms on desktops and steering wheels.</p><p>
    It's a testament to the good will engendered by <em>Alligator</em> that fans are now likewise calling the National's follow-up,
    <em>Boxer</em>, a grower. Despite the scrutiny
    greeting its release (brought on by the inevitable leaks), many listeners seem
    to be approaching these songs patiently, giving <em>Boxer</em> the space
    and time to reveal its dark, asymmetrical passageways. In a sense, the album
    demands it. The same elements that kept listeners returning to <em>Alligator</em> (Berninger's clever
    turns of phrase, the band's dramatic intensity) are present on <em>Boxer</em>, but are now more restrained and
    controlled. <br/></p><p>
    From the first piano chords on opener ""Fake Empire"", the National
    create a late-night, empty-city-street mood, slightly menacing but mostly isolated. The 10 tracks that follow sustain and even amplify that
    feeling, revealing the band's range as they play close to the vest. Aaron and
    Bryce Dessner's twin guitars don't so much battle one another as create a unified layer that acts as a full backdrop for the other instruments, while touring member Padma Newsome's
    string and horn arrangements infuse songs like ""Mistaken for Strangers"" and the
    stand-out ""Ada"" (featuring Sufjan Stevens on piano) with subtle drama. But <em>Boxer</em>
    is a drummer's album: Bryan Devendorf becomes a main player here, never merely keeping time but
    actively pushing the songs around. With machine precision, his fluttering tom
    rhythms add a heartbeat to ""Squalor Victoria""
    and give ""Brainy"" its stalker tension. In fact, the title <em>Boxer</em> could conceivably be a reference to the way his rhythms
    casually spar with Berninger's vocal melodies, jabbing and swinging at the
    singer's empathies and emotions.
    </p>
<p>
    Despite this implied violence,<em> Boxer</em> doesn't have the same aggressive self-reckoning and
    psychological damage assessment of <em>Alligator</em>. Here, Berninger sounds like he's able to look outward from that mental space instead of further
    inward. He observes the people around him-- friends, lovers, passersby--
    alternately addressing them directly and imagining himself in their minds. Or,
    as he sings on ""Green Gloves"", ""Get inside their clothes with my green gloves/ Watch their videos, in their chairs."" He sounds more genuinely empathetic than
    previously (the accusatory <em>you</em> from
    the first two albums is thankfully absent), toying with ambiguity and backing
    away from outright satire. Certain themes continue to prevail: He maintains a
    fear of white-collar assimilation, addressing ""Squalor Victoria"" and ""Racing
    Like a Pro"" to upwardly mobile hipster-yuppies (""Underline everything/ I'm a
    professional/ In my beloved white shirt""), and clings to his American angst
    (""We're half awake in a fake empire""), as though recognizing the world's craziness
    makes him more sane.
    </p>
<p>
    Better even than these songs are the three
    mid-album tracks that toy with a love = war metaphor that miraculously avoids the obviousness that implies.
    On ""Slow Show"", over background guitar drones and a piano theme that echoes U2's ""New Year's Day"", he daydreams, ""I want to hurry home to you/ Put on a
    slow dumb show for you/ Crack you up."" But the capper is in the coda: ""You know I
    dreamed about you for 29 years before I saw you."" That hard-won contentment
    begins to crumble in ""Apartment Story"", in which the world invades the couple's
    shared space, and in ""Start a War"", where the possibility of loss looms
    threateningly. ""Walk away now and you're gonna start a war,"" Berninger sings
    against the band's simple, uncomfortably insistent rhythm, his concrete fears
    giving the song the extra heft of the personal.
    </p>
<p>
    Obviously, it's pretty easy to read a lot into the
    National's music and especially into Berninger's lyrics, but that shouldn't
    imply that <em>Boxer</em> is a willfully difficult
    or overly academic work. Like those on their last album, these songs reveal
    themselves gradually but surely, building to the inevitable moment when they
    hit you in the gut. It's the rare album that gives back whatever you put into
    it.

Now we're faced with Stars' <em>Do You Trust Your Friends?</em>, which we may someday see as the tipping point from indie rock remix albums being idle, indulgent fan-club novelties to becoming inescapable annoyances.  Helpfully, it gathers all the transgressions of the trend into one convenient package: incestuous choice of collaborators, unimaginative use of technology, and reconfiguration that uniformly fails to improve on the originals. It also ups the criminal ante by revisiting, track-by-track, an album that's already three years old (<em>Set Yourself on Fire</em>) and splitting the time between flimsy remixes and lazy covers; in other words, Stars has <em>commissioned their own tribute album</em>. The sheer egotism is the most impressive thing about it.</p><p>
    Final Fantasy's leadoff take on ""Your Ex-Lover is Dead"" sets the tone, lying limply between remix and cover. Preserving Torquil Campbell and Amy Millan's vocals, Owen Pallett fills in the rest with waltzy piano and random string bursts that seem fairly oblivious to the song, sounding more like an audition to be Jon Brion's film-soundtrack intern than a new take on a song that was already more effectively cinematic to begin with. And Pallett's not the only one who utilizes the ""hey let's attach the original vocal track to whatever random shit we have lying around"" method, as the Most Serene Republic short-circuit the glistening synth-pop of ""Ageless Beauty"" by layering Millan's singing over an aimless acoustic jam, and the Stills use ""Soft Revolution"" as a riff-and-solo trashcan, with a horrible pan-flute solo as frosting.</p><p>
    Even when the covers sound less like a band cleaning out their hard drive, the reinterpretations misunderstand Stars' appeal and strengths. Both Apostle of Hustle's slack ""One More Night"" and the Russian Futurists' breakbeat-and-power-chord ""The First Five Times"" over-masculinize the sleepy and sensitive Stars sound, while retaining none of their romantic grandeur. Only Broken Social Scene alumnus Jason Collett's top-to-bottom remake of ""Reunion"" offers any sort of surprising alternate take, turning the song into a ragged, Stonesy number that's far enough afield of Stars' usual M.O. to justify the makeover.
    </p><p>
    In the actual remix department, there are multiple examples of the most common rearrangement gaffes. Camouflage Nights' ""Celebration Guns"" and the Dears' ""What I'm Trying to Say"" (inexplicably split into two parts) both commit the crime of reproduction, with new versions mostly adhering to the originals' structure and sounds and merely moving the sonic furniture around a bit (""hey, what if the chorus drumbeat was the drumbeat for the verses!""). Then there are the tracks that are completely electronified, but to little result, like the Junior Boys' phoned-in ""Sleep Tonight"", perhaps the most promising (given the Boys' remix know-how), and therefore disappointing, track on <em>Friends</em>. Minotaur Shock (with ""The Big Fight"") and Metric (""He Lied About Death"") at least get a little ambitious, but both leave the oven undercooked, the former rendered somewhat uncomfortable by gallons of empty space, and the latter fixated like a third-grader on the swear-word lyric ""don't fuck with our lives"" as it runs a psych-loop treadmill.
    </p>
<p>
    All together, <em>Do You Trust Your Friends?</em> is an ideal demonstration of why the trend of indie rock remix records should be snuffed out before they becomes industry standard. While we understand the urge to create this kind of stopgap project, either as a way to keep an artist's name in the newswire, a chance to make some extra pocket change with minimal work, or an opportunity to promote some musical pals, as an artistic statement these releases almost uniformly fail to creatively re-imagine any of the source material, only serving to fill the market with inferior versions. Ideally, indie bands will restrict their remixing impulses to B-sides and blog leaks, utilize artists with some experience and talent in the art, and spare us from the feeble, immaterial album-length likes of <em>Friends</em>.

    A brief series of birdcalls open Pterodactyl's
    self-titled debut. The misty chirps don't evoke the prehistoric lizard after
    which the Brooklyn-via-Ohio band named themselves-- more like the tiny
    creatures that wake you early on weekends. Regardless of who owns the peeps,
    it's a fitting 11 seconds, because even when Pterodactyl pushes for fury, a
    melodic sweetness and nerdy fragility hover within the trio's chiming guitars
    and cymbal crashes: These birds cackle, giggle, brim with sugar-coated
    spastics.</p><p>
    Folks use ""Brooklyn noise-rock"" to describe
    things that aren't so noisy, and maybe not even from Brooklyn. This particular
    not-so-noisy Brooklyn band is often linked to labelmates Parts &amp; Labor.
    First the practical reasons for the pairing: two thirds of P&amp;L released
    Pterodactyl's last 7-inch, along with the vinyl version of this one, on their
    Cardboard label. You could connect dots musically, but it's more telling to jot
    differences: drummer Matt Marlin goes easier on his equipment than P&amp;L's
    Christopher R. Weingarten; Pterodactyl's harmonies aren't as sonically or
    psychedelically deep; P&amp;L is a longer-running crew, able to draw from a
    bigger aesthetic/experiential bag of licks.</p><p>
    Pterodactyl can be raw,
    goofy, or upfront. The album's most compelling tracks, though, sport a high level of
    sampler-amped sumptuousness; they find a way to loop and rotate without losing steam. ""Safe
    Like A Train"" turns Sonic Slinty sharps into merry-go-rounds layered with
    clipped nasal pop-boy song-birding; on ""Polio"", muscular, slaphappy
    drums and slippery guitars lap against high, airy Jane's Addiction vocals;
    ""Three Succeed"" pits loping Deerhoofed staccato with duct-taped
    harmonies that make perfect sense on a label run by Oneida. The rush of
    ""Ask Me Nicely"" is a pummeling, snotty punk blast. 
    </p>
<p>
    Not everything is such a triumph. ""Rampage, Pt.
    1"", which introduces a mid-level pace and Modest Mouse-like sing-a-long,
    drags, though there's still something slinky about it. Also scattered
    throughout the program are a few too many micro-sound bits/bytes and
    instrumental fragments that, unlike the initial tweets, don't add much
    beyond padding... Not bad, but might as well cut to the chase. 
    </p>
<p>
    Thankfully, momentum's recovered torrentially on
    ""CHX. BX."", a Lighting Bolt-speed rocker, and the stately,
    time-ticking closer ""Esses"", which finds the group
    experimenting successfully with a slow-arcing six-minute build of
    barber-shopped, Beach-Boyed pop. Where those tiny incidentals and mid-tempo songs drag, this expansion's an emphatic exclamation. 
    </p>
<p>
    As groups grow increasingly sophisticated in genre
    blending, they can reject simplicity en route to aesthetic expansiveness.
    Spread your wings bravely, cool-- but it doesn't always work. As 2001 as it
    sounds, sometimes it best suits a group when they forgo the fancy shit and just
    rock. Interestingly, ""Esses"" shows Pterodactyl <em>are</em> capable of
    opening it up incrementally-- something to look forward to in the future. For
    now, the youngsters' collection, one of my favorite surprises of 2007,
    more often than not hits best when it plows ahead like an out-of-control
    pickup truck.

    With their infamously hectic live show and small catalog that's been
    tantalizing but spotty, I never thought the Narrator wanted to be just another
    above-average indie guitar band. I just figured they had yet to realize their
    ambitions on record. With <em>All That to the Wall</em>, however, the Narrator
    have indeed recorded an above-average indie guitar record, and in doing so have
    probably made their most cohesive and listenable full-length yet.</p><p>
    Don't take that as backhanded-- there's no way to capture in the studio
    hoarse catharsis, ringing ears, collapsing floorboards, errant bodily fluids, saxophonists in pink bunny suits, or whatever other shit happens at the band's shows, and I'd guess this
    record is borne of that realization. It's not a question of lowering the bar;
    it's knowing the difference between a performance and an album. The basic sound
    of the band hasn't changed significantly, but the difference is clear right
    away: On opener ""Son of Son of the Kiss of Death"", the guitars are
    still winding and spidery, but the vocals have been refined considerably, their
    frayed and flailing yelp becoming more expressive at every turn. The stiff
    fingering of the verses shifts to a surprisingly catchy, straightforward
    chorus, with just a few keyboard notes poking through before they finally grind
    through some cacophonous bent notes in the outro. Even with that, they sound
    more patient, balanced, and focused.</p><p>
    No doubt that they're stronger songwriters now: anthems like
    ""SurfJew"" can stand up to rushed beats and sweaty deconstruction on
    stage as well as repeat listens on headphones. (Best I can tell, it's about a
    west coast Bar Mitzvah, but the band's lyrics have been largely nonsense and
    that trend continues here.) But more than that, they've integrated their
    previously rough edges and found ways to responsibly sabotage their perkier pop
    tendencies, presenting accessible songs with unusual production choices.
    ""Son of the Son of the Kiss of Death"" stops everything for a
    backwards-sucking string sound, there's a theremin-like keyboard drone in
    ""Speeding up the Gang"", and later tracks like ""A Decade in
    Kentucky"" utilize strange echoes and flanges. 
    </p>
<p>
    The record's centerpiece is a Bob Dylan cover. If that surprises you, the
    song they chose will really throw you: ""All the Tired Horses"", which
    is given a faithful and somber reading. Not only does it show how far their
    singing has come, it also includes anachronistic production touches like
    heavily-reverbed Max Weinberg-style drum hits and the synthetic pluck of
    simulated strings, lending it a nostalgic but weirdly out-of-time quality.
    Funny that there's a gradual downhill slide after the cover, though there's a
    memorable staccato delivery in ""Papal Airways"", and a weary but
    impressively building melody on ""Breaking the Turtle"", one last gasp
    of the band showing what they're made of before the tired, almost pop-punk
    toss-off of ""A Decade in Kentucky"". 
    </p>
<p>
    Armchair critics have long cited ""All the Tired Horses"" as a sort
    of commentary on the creative exhaustion Dylan was feeling at the time, a
    judgment based on the homonym present in the lyric, ""How'm I gonna get any
    riding done"" (substituting ""writing"" for ""riding"").
    Given the more sluggish second half of this record, you could say the Dylan
    song signifies the Narrator's fatigue-- they did lose a drummer not long ago, and grabbed fill-ins from Russian
    Circles and Oxford Collapse to finish the record. But there's something
    endearing in how they present this on-the-nose version of an imperfect castaway
    with all sincerity. The Narrator sound better on record with less to prove,
    making imperfect pop out of their rough edges, and turning fuck-ups into hymns.

    Sick, sick, sick. That's what this album is. Oh sure, it sounds pretty, with
    its gentle, mostly acoustic arrangements, whispery vocals, and other folkish
    whatnot, but wait a second. All those references to grinding bones and eating
    flesh and burying things aren't metaphors or poetic turns of phrase-- they're
    actually about killing people, eating them, and burying them. Songwriter and
    principle vocalist Jacob Thomas Berns sounds musically well adjusted, but I get
    the feeling he was the kid who worried his eight grade English teacher with
    disturbing journal entries about sexual violence and cold-blooded murder.</p><p>
    Berns is abetted by two accomplices in these crimes. Multi-instrumentalist
    Ernest Christian Kiehne, Jr. colors the arrangements with jaunty banjo, some
    lovely steel guitar, and the occasional subdued organ part, while second
    vocalist Sonya Maria Cotton, who is a really damn fine singer, gets down in the
    dirt with Berns and assists in the drownings, statutory rapes, and shootings
    with disconcerting ease. ""Let me cover you up/ With my flannel shirt/ Your
    skin so cold without a skirt on."" Those are the opening lines of the
    record, on a song called ""Better For It, Kid"". Uh, yeah. Take the
    ""kid"" part literally and you pretty much figured out what happens in
    the song.</p><p>
    The very next track, ""Mess Around"", opens with a guy talking to a
    young girl, telling her it's okay if she wants to mess around, and goes on to
    say that her body will be found before her hair can grow out long. But the
    music is this pretty acoustic fingerpicking and the vocals are more fragile
    than Delftware-- it's an insidious and nauseating juxtaposition, but it's no
    worse than some of the darkest murder ballads that populate the established
    songbook. If nothing else, the little bird that lit down on Henry Lee has some
    company now. 
    </p>
<p>
    So here's the thing: I can't decide if this is all unforgivably repulsive or
    totally ingenious. The record disarms you so thoroughly with its gentleness and
    lack of dissonance that when you get to figuring out the content, you almost
    become like one of the victims from Berns' songs. There are moments of striking
    beauty, like the steel guitar intro to ""O, Ohio"" or the organ passage
    that takes up the end of ""Buried Treasure"", which is fairly close to
    Low's ""Sunflower"" in its overall feeling. Cotton's lead vocals on
    ""Swimming in the Swamp"" are coldly perfect as she sings
    matter-of-factly about disposing of a body with dirt in its mouth in a vast
    swamp. 
    </p>
<p>
    My overall impression is conflicted-- the songs are nice-sounding but not
    terribly memorable melodically, and they all tend to follow a formula of a
    couple verses followed by a short instrumental passage, the last of which
    finally goes fully electric, with a wailing e-bowed guitar part. As much as I
    love brevity, I think they might benefit from stretching out a bit and
    developing the stories in the songs. The combination of dainty folk music with
    murderous and lecherous themes is decently executed, but you have to wonder if
    they can do it again without it feeling tired. Personally, I can't decide
    whether to listen to it once more or stop Berns before he kills again.

    It's not hard to imagine a time when music comes from increasingly obscure sources, out from a corner of the smallest bedroom in an apartment shared by four people blogging about four different records, arranging tours on the fly (with about a 50-50 ratio of confirmed dates to TBAs), producing impeccable hybrid music for god knows what audience of downloaders and strangely bedfellowed word-of-mouthers. I'm not just talking about experimental stuff either, but ""pop"" and ""dance"" and ""indie,"" and did I mention ""pop""? It's not hard to imagine this because it's already happening. Chances are, you or someone you know has turned out a track in the last few months that sounds suspiciously accomplished, oddly amazing, and perhaps even deserving of widespread recognition; sure, software and various electronic machinery make music production easier, but they don't necessarily make it ""good,"" which is why people like Maurice Fulton, Kathy Diamond, and [insert your friend here] are such badasses.</p><p>
    Fulton has been making and house and future-soul tracks for more than a decade under the guise of at least a dozen aliases and (usually) short-lived groups-- which means, you can't exactly call him a bedroom producer. However, in the best indie tradition, he manages to maintain an almost iconoclastic, stubbornly outsider profile. His fans (hello there) endlessly sing his praises while his gigs go late into the night and attract a weird mix of clubbers, hipsters, and electro-musos, but his MySpace blog posts can read like rants from an exiled deviant, going so far as to blacklist any potential ""friends"" repping for a certain hated former label. His records with wife Mutsumi Kanamori as Mu feature some of the best electronic, dance-ish music of the decade, yet still seem on the outer fringe of what you'll hear in a club on any given night.</p><p>
    Diamond's résumé isn't as full, but she's hardly less independently minded. Originally from Sheffield, UK (Fulton's current residence), she describes the long, frequently frustrating road to self-releasing her music on her MySpace bio, and though that kind of story is hardly rare for independent musicians, the quality of the songs on her debut album is. <em>Miss Diamond to You</em> (with production credits for Fulton, though ""performed"" by his Syclops alias) is hard soul for beardos. However, it's also got hooks all over the place, accentuated by Fulton's never-intrusive mix of rock drums (""programmed"" of course), funky bass (definitely <em>not</em> programmed), and a countless array of synth patches that he uses both sparingly and to perfect accompanying effect. And yes, there's something about the record that sounds borne of a couple of people holed up in a small Sheffield studio; perhaps it's consistency of the sound from track to track, or maybe it's just the top-heavy, ultra-compressed timbre of Diamond's vocals which sound a bit on the demo-y side compared to, I don't know, Timbaland producing Nelly Furtado.
    </p>
<p>
    Still, the songs and the beats don't lie: This is a good record. Diamond's vocal melodies in tunes like opener ""Between the Lines"" or her underrated 2006 single ""All Woman"" are airy but syncopated and percussive at just the right moments, as any melody worth its pop has to be. Her ""watch me, see me, love me, push me, pull me"" over Fulton's tight arrangement of slap bass, handclaps, and funky chicken-scratch guitar is like hearing Kylie Minogue perform with Chic, and when Fulton brings in the cavernous echo and salsa percussion on ""Until the Sun Goes Down"", what could easily have sounded overstuffed and eye-rollingly ""eclectic"" just comes out like a self-contained block party. Indeed, when the snare figure comes in, shortly succeeded by the churning, Tangerine Dream-y synth patterns (an increasingly hip sonic reference for dance producers), the track could pass for a break in a Mu song. And then Diamond comes in with the vocal, and it becomes immediately apparent: This is Pop. 
    </p>
    Ultimately, I guess that's part of the only disappointing aspect of the record. Where these songs beg to be played loud for large numbers of happy people, the vaguely homemade sound occasionally compacts what should be expansive. Make no mistake, subtle details of record mastering or mixing aren't enough to sink the songs, and if you heard this stuff in a DJ set between, say, a Lindstrøm track and a Deodato re-edit, you wouldn't notice anything except how hard it was tell which tracks were new and which were from 1983. And even then, you probably wouldn't care: The modern independent musician not only refuses to die, she's getting better and better every night.</div>"|10233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10233-miss-diamond-to-you/|7.8|Dominique Leone

    This piano/electronics duo is an arrangement Ryuichi Sakamoto has been
    recently exploring in concert, with ultra-minimalist Alva Noto among others, so
    it seems a natural for his second collaboration with Christian Fennesz.
    Listening to <em>Cendre </em>after returning again to <em>Sala Saint Cecilia,</em>
    their EP from 2005, affirms that the two records couldn't be more different.
    The latter was a single live 19-minute track that found Sakamoto inhabiting the
    abstract digitalia we've come to associate with Fennesz, directing his diverse
    talent toward epic computer-based composition. <em>Cendre </em>feels like a
    meeting of equals occurring precisely halfway between the two.</p><p>
    The obvious precursors here are the two albums composer Harold Budd made
    with producer Brian Eno. Like <em>Ambient 2/Plateaux of Mirror </em>and <em>The
    Pearl</em>, <em>Cendre </em>consists of one person playing delicate pieces on an
    acoustic piano while another fills the ample spaces with electronic treatments.
    Eno's contributions to the Budd records were sometimes so subtle you weren't
    sure he was doing anything beyond giving the reverb slider an occasional bump.
    Fennesz' omnipresent drones and crackly beds of sound, on the other hand, are
    central here, providing a virtual room for Sakamoto's piano and regularly
    shifting the tone of the pieces by several shades in a given direction. Fennesz
    also plays and processes guitar, and he and Sakamoto both are credited with
    ""laptop.""</p><p>
    There's an intriguing openness to this music, a sense of suggestion that
    nonetheless refuses to favor any particular mood. Fennesz and Sakamoto seem to
    be constantly searching for those in-between spaces, where serenity is infused
    with a sense of uneasiness and hope is laced with dread. The music's emotional
    cast can move in any of several directions depending on what the listener
    brings to it. Because of this atmospheric flexibility, <em>Cendre </em>as a whole
    is at first difficult to get a handle on, and single-word song titles like
    ""Trace"" and ""Mono"" provide few clues. 
    </p>
<p>
    Sometimes the musicians seem to be pushing against each other, as on
    ""Aware"". Here Sakamoto's right hand plays a soft melody while the
    disconcerting electronics stew and churn, a veritable cauldron of trouble and
    unease. ""Glow"" derives its energy from the contrast between the
    measured piano lines and the unpredictable surges of feedback and bits of
    cut-up guitar, which emerge like random flutters of sound bouncing against some
    Chopin nocturne. Elsewhere, the two composers seem to be working in concert
    toward a single goal, as with the title track, which is mostly electronic drone
    with bits of a garbled transmission and just a foreboding bass note or two from
    the piano. 
    </p>
    Ever
    since having my guts torn out by an encounter with Satie's <em>Gymnopédies</em>
    many years ago, a certain kind of piano makes me a little suspicious. From
    watching films, we're so used to hearing spare keyboard melodies propping up
    melodrama, it can seem too easy to rig an effect, so I've always got an ear out
    for something that feels manipulative. This music, which is most interesting
    when the record is heard at its full length, seems to come from a different
    place. With its even mood and patiently unfolding tracks, <em>Cendre </em>leaves
    a lot of time and space for contemplation, and there is the sense that the
    listener is expected to do some work to ""complete"" the music. <em>Cendre</em>
    seems to be a series of exquisitely phrased questions that we're all to answer
    as we wish.</div>"|10236.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10236-cendre/|7.9|Mark Richardson

It's the kind of amorphous sound mass you imagine at the beginning of the universe, an obliterative black-hole suction that takes modern cues only from the intuitive progressions of jazz and the chaotic sound atmospheres of electronic devices. Not to mention that post-rock is in the habit of forcing its cues, determined to hit that cathartic peak before the tape runs out. Supersilent, meanwhile, arrives at catharsis torturously if at all, preferring to let their variations unspool organically, reveling in unresolved tension and inertia.</p><p>
    On his third full-length album for Rune Grammofon, Supersilent's virtuoso trumpeter Arve Henriksen explores the genesis of his own universe: <em>Strjon</em> is the medieval name of Henriksen's home town-- it roughly means ""streaming water,"" which even the most unsympathetic listener would have to admit is germane to the album's fluid, natural sound. Drawing from a wealth of home-taped sounds from his youth in Stryn, Henriksen recruited his Supersilent band mates Ståle Storløkken and Helge Sten to produce the album and to add keyboards and guitars to Henriksen's trumpet and electronics. But <em>Strjon</em> isn't an early demos thing; Henriksen simply used these early sketches as templates, allowing his modern polish to dovetail with his youthful zeal.</p><p>
    The result is a quietly stunning album of fugues, stasis, and moods. Given the starkness of its sound palette and the restraint of its compositions, its allure is uncanny-- that melancholy trumpets threading through evocative drones doesn't wear thin over the album's forty-seven minutes is a testament to Henriksen's compositional ingenuity and ace musicianship. The album opens with ""Evocation"": The sinuous, quavering trumpet figure is at once ominous and inviting; it has a palpable whooshing quality that makes it sound almost like a reed instrument, and you get a distinct sense of the musician's subtle embrasure behind the sounds. As a bowed drone pushes in for contrast, Henriksen's theme breaks out of its unsteady rut and waxes lyrical. Amid the gently reverbed guitars of ""Leaf and Rock"", Henriksen plays a slightly throttled and darkly romantic theme that cracks emotively at its root notes. His trumpet springs tiny, squealing leaks over the angelic glimmer of ""In the Light"", and lurches through damaged iterations of the caesurae-divided theme of ""Evocation"".
    </p><p>
    Elsewhere on the album, Henriksen breaks away from this satisfying but circumscribed approach to tinker with rhythm and mood. On ""Twin Lake"" cavernous guitar twinkles play off of hovering keyboards and Henriksen's bracingly high trumpet runs. Its nighttime-at-the-wharf aura is so strong you can practically smell the brine; all that's missing is the caw of gulls and the lonesome clank of a rusty pylon bell. The title track consists of nothing more than a primordial, modulating rumble; it's a study in soupy inertia. ""Green Water"" is light and airy with an atonal atmospheric buffer; percussive pings make it feel less nebulous than most of the album. ""Black Mountain"", a gyroscopic whirl of clipped, aggressive synth peals, is also atypically kinetic. And on ""Glacier Descent"", which is remindful of Growing with its shivering melodic cycles and low textural rumbles, Henriksen intones clear vowels over droning throat singing, gradually gathering it all up into a celestial crescendo. It's worth noting that the presence of a voice doesn't humanize ""Glacier Descent"" to any greater degree than the instrumental songs on <em>Strjon</em>, an album that is remarkable for its intimacy and wordless expressivity.

    headlines overseas last year for the label bidding war that ultimately found
    them a place with venerable Warner Music Group subsidiary Atlantic.
    If there's anything American indie rock fans have largely rediscovered in the
    last couple of years, it's that a jump to a major label doesn't necessarily
    mean a band has started to suck. Among the more recent examples, Death Cab for Cutie and then
    the Decemberists executed the transition with only minor stylistic changes, the latter group if anything becoming weirder.</p><p>
    Fields haven't started to suck, either, but they <em>have</em> gone
    from winsome guitar-pop group to unwieldy big-room behemoths. Maybe
    they figured Muse's shift toward glammed-out dance-rock on last year's <em>Supermassive Black Hole</em> left room for another purveyor of overly
    compressed post-Radiohead mope. <em>Everything
    Last Winter</em> still has the close boy/girl harmonies, insistent
    songwriting,  and restrained squalls of
    the band's early releases, including 2006's <em>7 From the Village </em>EP; it's still, in the words of Pitchfork's
    Stuart Berman, a ""Zach Braff panty-remover soundtrack."" On the other hand, it's
    harder to get someone else naked when you keep putting on more and more layers
    of clothing.</p><p>
    Like another hushed UK indie band gone arena-ready,
    Snow Patrol, Fields really do have the tunes and the detached grandeur to one
    day potentially play big venues. While their
    songs may lack the wounded emotional verisimilitude of Gary Lightbody's best
    work, they share his Glasgow
    band's predilection for restrained, shoegaze-indebted white-noise tendrils. Single
    ""If You Fail We All Fail"" distills the band's perpetually ascending
    shimmer into nearly six minutes of electronic Slowdive swirls, submerged acoustic
    guitars, and the vocal interplay of singer/guitarist Nick Peill with
    keyboardist Thorunn Antonia. ""I need you as much as they do,"" the two
    murmur, their vaguely pleasant vagueness almost (but never quite) overcome by superfluous overdubs and
    reverb. This is where college-town babies come from.
    </p><p>
    As big as the heart-swelling hooks get, though, Fields are
    more memorable when they let their early-1970s folk ghosts creep into the
    corners of their songs like dusty cobwebs. Antonia's breathy coo takes the
    lead amid the modal whir of ""Feathers"", but the song loses its way in
    the woods during a final crescendo of whitecapped guitar, strings, and effects.
    The lofty vocal harmonies of Peill, Antonia, and drummer Henry Spenner finally
    get some space to settle in on languid acoustic waltz ""Schoolbooks"".
    Songs such as these, the ironically sweet ""Skulls and Flesh and More""
    and lilting campfire closer ""Parasite"" suggest Fields might've been like a
    more mystical Magic Numbers if there had never been a Doves or Elbow. 
    </p>
<p>
    The band (and producer Michael Beinhorn, whose
    credits include Korn, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Soundgarden along with Mew and
    Herbie Hancock), must have had other ideas. Surging opener ""A Song for the Fields"",
    here in its latest of many incarnations, encapsulates Fields' shift from
    folk-tinged British rockers to red-line anthem hawkers, thick with so many
    heavily compressed effects and guitar fireworks that the song has, paradoxically,
    gotten less direct even as it's become more radio-polished. Perhaps it's as Peill proclaims
    over a Snow Patrol thrum on ""Charming the Flames"": ""Passion
    makes you vain."" Halloween-ready rocker ""The Death"" is an
    ill-advised sojourn into demonic whispers (unsurprisingly, Beinhorn has also
    produced Marilyn Manson). On the Pete Yorn-like ""You Don't Need This Song
    (To Fix Your Broken Heart)"", yet another track that undercuts its
    catchiness with anonymizing slickness, Peill adds, ""Sing this song like any
    other one/ 'Cause they're all the same."" Thing is, they're really not, but on <em>Everything Last Winter</em> it eventually starts to sound that way.

The setup made sense; since Carlos Giffoni's solo work to that point consisted primarily of electronic-based noise, it figured he would surround himself with like-minded sound-makers in a group setting.</p><p>
    It turns out that show was an anomaly-- Monotract's roots actually lie more in fractured punk rock than experimental noise. Since forming in Miami in 1998 (and moving to New York in 2000), they have produced a slew of releases exploring many sonic styles and instrumental configurations. But most often, the group starts from a foundation of guitar, bass, and drums. Last year's <em>Xprmntl Lvrs</em> gave the most balanced version of Monotract's noise/rock amalgam, with punkish beats and semi-melodic vocals grafted to harsh electronics and guitar distortion.</p><p>
<em>Trueno Oscuro</em> (which means ""Dark Thunder"") also stitches rock and noise into one monstrous hybrid, but leans farther toward the rock side than any previous Monotract release: Nearly every song here has a big, bold beat, supplied by the mix-dominating pound of drummer Roger Rimada. On top of that huge pulse, Giffoni and bassist/vocalist Nancy Garcia spin thorny noise, sauntering bass, and rhythmic vocal chants. This spastic combination can produce oddly funky tunes-- a kind of skewed dance-noise akin to the fractured chug of RTX, the disco damage of Ciccone Youth, or even the hardcore crunch of Atari Teenage Riot.</p><p>
    There's also something sultry and even seductive about the way Monotract swings and sways here, especially during the songs sung by Garcia. On ""Big N"", her breathy half-spoken vocals cascade over Ramada's hip-hop beat like syrup over pancakes, while her urgent yelps at the close of ""Muddy Thunder"" bewitch like Lydia Lunch's best screams.  On the only cut without drums, ""Under My Arm"", she tentatively whispers over whirring drone, her voice a siren as entrancing as Kim Gordon's on Sonic Youth's ""Shadow of a Doubt"".</p><p>
    When Rimada and Giffoni sing, Monotract's sound gets a little less unpredictable. The marching thump of ""Ballad of Lechon"", DNA-like stop/start of ""Cafu y Kaka"", and metallic stomp of ""Mar Roja"" are all meaty enough on their own, but strung together they feel like blurry photocopies of each other. But whatever repetition <em>Trueno Oscuro</em> suffers from is easily offset by the record's many high points, making for another unique entry in Monotract's rainbow-colored catalog.</p></div>"|10211.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10211-trueno-oscuro/|7.3|Marc Masters

His heritage implies this; much like his father Loudon and his mother, Kate McGarrigle-- as well as spiritual contemporaries ranging from Randy Newman to Van Morrison-- Wainwright is cut from the cloth of songwriter for whom youth isn't an essential component of creativity. A quick scan through Wainwright's discography reveals he often falters when he self-consciously asserts his age. Whether in occasionally cringeworthy attempts to massage fragments of popular culture into his comi-tragedies (see 2003's ""Vibrate"", on which he crooned ""My phone's on vibrate for you"") or his increasing propensity for folding rock music into his otherwise anachronistic cabaret pop, Wainwright generally works best when he's trying to be outside of his time, not of it.</p><p>
    Continuing in the tradition of 2003/04's double-shot of <em>Want One</em> and <em>Want Two</em>, <em>Release the Stars</em> finds Wainwright flitting between opposite poles-- lovestruck and glib, opulent and gimmicky, overblown and undercooked-- with rumpled uncertainty.  To be fair, it doesn't take much to locate the source of his wanderings; unlike most new artists, Wainwright came out of the gate with an incredibly assured aesthetic. Both his 1998 self-titled debut and his 2001 follow-up <em>Poses</em> were remarkably developed records-- the former establishing his way with a wending, operatic arrangement; the latter proving his songs nicely amenable to tidy flourishes of 70s AOR. Since then, whether out of boredom, excitement, or desire for the mainstream acceptance he's so frequently pined for, Wainwright's expanded his sound, tempering his natural inclination towards opulence with different song styles and textures, always with mixed results.</p><p>
    A theatre buff, Wainwright has always known the value of a good opener, and <em>Release the Stars</em> is no exception. ""Why does it always have to be fire and brimstone?"" he wonders in the explosive curtain-raiser ""Do I Disappoint You"", which itself sounds a bit like five orchestras playing out the second coming. That's followed by first single ""Going to a Town"", which balances simple piano chords against a uncommonly pointed lyric: ""I'm going to a town that has already been burnt down/ I'm going to a place that has already been disgraced/ I'm gonna see some folks who have already been let down/ I'm so tired of America."" With all kinds of satisfying variations and twists on the main melody, it's the rare political song that actually hits its mark, and is easily the album's highlight. </p><p>
    As is often the case, Wainwright's ballads account for a disproportionate amount of the standout moments. With its gentle turns of phrase and slow string arrangements, ""Nobody's Off the Hook"" recalls what still might be his finest single song, 2001's ""Poses"". Elsewhere, ""Leaving For Paris No. 2"" finds Wainwright at his most lovelorn, wrenching a meandering ballad out of a churning piano motif. </p><p>
    As he's always been better about writing about romance than sex, there are some clunkers to contend with as well. None of are more forgettable than the tepid bar-room rock of ""Between My Legs"", in which a small army of lite rock guitar peels soundtrack Wainwright ""shedding a tear"" you know where. Meanwhile, allegedly based on Wainwright's one-night stand with the Killers' Brandon Flowers, ""Tulsa"" opens with a killer jab (""You taste of potato chips in the morning/ Your face has the Marlon Brando club calling"") and descends into self-aware pointlessness. Even worse is ""Slideshow"", a six-minute epic that rests on a ludicrously overwrought refrain: ""And I better be prominently featured in your next slideshow."" </p><p>
    Such frequent attempts to elevate the banal into the meaningful ultimately keep <em>Release the Stars</em> from achieving any significant momentum and only add weight to the notion that Wainwright's shaky aim-- rather than his lack of talent-- might be his biggest downfall. Nonetheless, it's hard to take away from what he's already accomplished. At only 33, he's quietly amassed a body of work, the best of which rivals most of his  singer/songwriter contemporaries. If we do ever get that masterpiece, it'll be straight icing.<br/></p></div>"|10235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10235-release-the-stars/|6.7|Mark Pytlik

Now forget I mentioned both those names, much less ""minimal house music,"" because <em>Rumpelzirkus</em>, Kalabrese's beguiling debut album, absolutely deserves to be heard on its own terms.</p><p>
    The record opens with a platitude wrapped in a cliché, as a Jamaican-accented voice-- certainly not Kalabrese's-- deadpans, ""Where's the future? It's not the past, it's not the present. It's…the future."" You can take your finger off the eject button, though. This isn't some European roots-reggae travesty; that's just Kalabrese's off-kilter sense of humor. Living up to the latter half of its name, <em>Rumpelzirkus</em> carries about it an air of the carnivalesque, or at least the tongue-in-cheek, that verges on the outright bizarre. (What else are we to make of a song like ""Aufm Klo"", that begins with Kalabrese, sounding a bit like Bob Dylan as filtered through a vocoder, singing, ""I got pain in my ass…""?)</p><p>
    Beyond that tongue-in-cheek intro, there's actually next to no reggae here, beyond the obvious genetic trace of dub that enlivens all electronic music. There's just as little overt futurism, if by futurism you mean the streamlined forms and steely timbres that have electrified the electronic-music imaginary since Kraftwerk and Cybotron. <em>Rumpelzirkus</em> is a bit of a head-scratcher: Is it a click-house album aimed at listeners who prefer real live instruments or a lush comedown reverie for real live clubkids? Really, it's both of those things and more.</p><p>
    Most of the album's cuts ride a bumptious 4/4 beat, which won't be surprising given the album's distribution via Kompakt and Kalabrese's own discography. (Perlon published his best known single, and various of his tracks have appeared on James Holden's <em>At the Controls</em> session, the Four:Twenty label's <em>Circoloco at DC10 Ibiza</em> showcase, and Akufen and Tyrant's respective Fabric mix CDs.) But this is hardly your bog-standard <em>oonce-oonce</em>. Most of Kalabrese's beats are made not with drum machines or soft synths but clattery samples swathed in natural reverb: sticks on rims, pots and pans, creaky bedsprings, drunken handclaps. He's not afraid of a fat analog kick or fizzy, filtered white-noise hi-hats, but the machine aesthetic never dominates-- especially once we move out of the percussive layers. With the exception of a few growling analog synthesizers, electric and acoustic instruments dominate-- low-slung electric bass, kalimbas, glockenspiels, tambourines, horns, and acoustic guitar-- giving rise to the specter of folk-house, or maybe, just maybe, something we might call <em>strum</em>inal.</p><p>
    But ultimately it's not what Kalabrese puts in his music that's important, but his sophisticated compositional sensibility. At their best, Kalabrese's songs draw simultaneously from dance music and pop songwriting, fusing a rare sort of architectonic strength with a tender, unabashedly sentimental sense of narrative.</p><p>
    In keeping with all good dance music, there is no real division between the rhythmic and melodic registers. On ""Deep"", for instance, a lone acoustic guitar figure taps out a gleaming ostinato pattern that the beat warily circles like a side-stepping spider. On ""Heartbreak Hotel"", hand drums, spindly guitar lines, Moogy squeals, and groaning vocal harmonies string together a kind of pointillistic approximation of a country ballad. ""Not the Same Shoes"" starts off almost like a parody of a minimal house track, complete with a baritone voice supplying an eighth-note <em>boom-boom-boom</em> pattern, before blooming into a gravelly duet with the Swiss laptop chanteuse Kate Wax. He-said/she-said verses make a play for radio-readiness as vines of bright analog synthesizer go climbing like morning glory through the track's percussive lattice. (It's a remarkably similar strategy to that used by LCD Soundsystem's ""Someone Great"".)</p><p>
    On the very best songs, Kalabrese extends his ambitions beyond the horizontal, proving himself to be a remarkably talented songwriter, full stop. ""Hide"", featuring the rosin-throated Guillermo Sohrya, goes so far as to suggest José González' acoustic mood pieces as fleshed out with Afrobeat-inflected guitar licks, swirling Hammond organs, jittery synthesizer blips and a woozy barroom guitar solo. Cozy as a duvet, its most immediate reference point might be Yo La Tengo's ""Autumn Sweater""-- but better written, better produced, and better suited for tugging heartstrings to the point of unraveling. It's a shame that Valentine's Day is behind us, because ""Hide"" is the lovers' mixtape closer of the year.</p><p>
<em>Rumpelzirkus</em>' greatest asset might just be its sense of surprise, rolling as magically haphazard as a jam band in top form. Just listen to the way ""Oisi Zuekunft"", the album's oddball opener, evolves unexpectedly from a grab-bag of po-faced phrases and sly musical jokes into a slow-burning groove: the last third of the song squeezes the horns into a bellows that stokes the funk and blows away any stray trace of irony. (Just as almost every individual track displays a remarkable sense of development, the whole album is marked by a masterful sense of flow: given that the 11 cuts were initially released on three 12-inch E.P.s, <em>Rumpelzirkus</em> makes for an uncannily cohesive longplayer.) The same trick inflates the closing ""Body Tight"" from its anemic percussive opening into a billowing sentimental singalong. <em>Rumpelzirkus</em>'s title, it turns out, has less to do with circuses than with the fairy tale of Rumpelstiltskin (or in German, Rumpelstilzchen): Kalabrese takes straw and spins it into gold.</p></div>"|10230.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10230-rumpelzirkus/|8.4|Philip Sherburne

    There's a tendency among Americans to think of the Bahamas as
    nothing but a tourist destination, a place to go snorkeling and get a tan. We
    tend to forget that people live there, that people were living there even
    before it became one of the first places in the Western
    Hemisphere to be spotted by Europeans. The country's population
    today is made up largely of the descendants of British loyalists who fled the U.S.
    after 1783, the slaves they brought with them and escaped slaves who took
    advantage of the short water route to the islands after slavery was abolished
    in the Crown colonies in 1834.</p><p>
    The islands achieved self-governance in 1964, and 10 years
    later became fully independent from Britain,
    but most of the country's cultural and popular influence from outside came
    across the Straits of Florida. In the 60s and
    70s, that meant jazz, rock, soul, and funk. The island
    of Grand Bahama is the closest to Florida, and during
    those decades played host to an intriguing music scene that lightly
    Caribbean-ized American soul and funk. The music that scene produced during its
    heyday is, like so much other global music from that era, very much in danger
    of disappearing from the collective memory-- a hot, rainy island that gets nailed
    by about one major hurricane each decade isn't the most conducive environment
    to keeping tapes and old LPs in top shape.</p><p>
    Enter Numero Group, whose Cult Cargo series, now two
    volumes, extends the brilliant restoration work of their Eccentric Soul series
    beyond U.S. shores. They chose the word goombay for the title because of its
    myriad meanings on Grand Bahama-- it's a flavor,
    an annual festival, and most importantly for our purposes, both a drum and the
    style of music for which that drum provides the rhythm. In the 60s, Grand
    Bahama was in the early stages of a tourist boom that continues to
    the present day, and tourists begat hotels begat bands begat recordings. The
    key figure in the island's scene was a man named Frank Penn, a bartender/barber/carpenter
    who found himself in possession of the Bamboo East when its owner hopped the
    pond to the States. 
    </p>
<p>
    Penn set about transforming it into a youth music hotspot
    and ultimately parlayed its success into a record label, GBI International,
    which released most of the music on this compilation. Penn himself shows up on
    instrumental and vocal versions of his song ""Gimme Some Skin"", offering the
    opening couplet ""Black is beautiful/ White is nice"" in a gentle falsetto that
    floats right over the top of the locked-in drums, wah-soaked guitar, and bright,
    catchy horns. As his country gained its independence, Penn was integral in
    helping the people of his island discover their own thing, and
    interracial harmony was part of that vision. 
    </p>
<p>
    There were also plenty of good bands for Penn to record, and the
    Mustangs were one of the best. Their two tracks here are both laid-back soul
    killers. ""Whatcha Gonna Do 'Bout It"" bumps along on a slow but insistent
    rhythm, with the lead vocals joined in two-part harmony on key phrases, while
    ""The Time For Loving Is Now"" seems to be balancing influences from all over the
    Western Hemisphere, from Jamaica to Cuba to Detroit. The compilation
    incorporates a fairly eclectic batch of songs, including a few truly unexpected
    gems: Ozzie Hall's cover of Paul Desmond's ""Take Five"" is a brilliantly funky,
    even noir-ish recasting of the song (it also ignores the 5/4 rhythm that helped
    make the original famous), while Sylvia Hall's ""Don't Touch That Thing"" takes a
    slightly racy schoolyard chant advocating abstinence (""don't touch that
    thing/your belly gonna show,"" concludes the chorus) and turns it into a slice
    of breezy, instantly memorable funk.
    </p>
<p>
    All these other artists are pretty much hors d'oeuvre for
    Jay Mitchell, though. The Grand Bahama native rules this compilation like he
    ruled the scene in Nassau,
    the Bahamian capital he left for as soon as he could. Mitchell very nearly had
    a career in the States-he toured with Otis Redding, who was slated to produce
    an album for him, but he instead returned to Freeport,
    Grand Bahama after tiring of road life and the pressure of trying to make it in
    the ocean of American pop music. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's clear from the five tracks here that he could have gone
    as far as he wanted to. The man was an adroit bandleader who presided over
    lengthy funk workouts like ""Funky Fever"" and ""Tighter &amp; Tighter"" with
    charismatic authority, leading the band into fantastic breakdowns full of nasty
    breaks and peels of psychedelic guitar. He was capable of sweetness, too, as on
    his smooth, elegant 1968 cover of Edwin Starr's ""I Am the Man For You, Baby"".
    His ""Goombay Bump"", written by Penn, is a distinctively Bahamian creation,
    creating a dance around a fluid local rhythm. But it's his mind-blowing 13-minute cover of ""Mustang Sally"" that best highlights his genius. Apart
    from the lyrics, it doesn't even resemble the song we know, riding a sick drum
    beat and a healthy slathering of Hammond
    organ until it boils over. 
    </p>
<p>
    That cover closes the disc, which is fitting, because I
    don't know what you'd follow it with. It's a perfect capper for yet another
    ridiculously great compilation from Numero Group. It's not a perfect disc,
    mostly because of an embarrassingly inept cover of ""Theme From 'Shaft'"", but it's so full of great,
    nearly lost music that it's hard to fault the inclusion of a head-scratching
    curio like that. On the whole, <em>Grand
    Bahama Goombay</em> offers a peek into a musical world well worth preserving,
    and I can't wait to see where Cult Cargo goes next.

Suppose someone told you the Harlem Shakes were from, say, Albuquerque and they employed good use of that ""Albuquerque keyboard sound."" Now you probably never heard of a keyboard sound from Albuquerque, but you may find yourself knowingly nodding anyway, and you have instant (albeit false) familiarity with this brand new group. Well, the Harlem Shakes aren't from Albuquerque, they're from (surprise!) New York, a city that rouses about a gazillion times more presumptions about its bands than nearly anywhere else on Earth.</p><p>
    Blame it on the NYC indie explosion at the beginning of this decade, when bands as disparate as the Strokes, Interpol, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs were all credited with capturing the Big Apple's essence. At this point the label almost carries a stigma of pleasure and privilege, one which the Shakes-- a smart, young quintet that's run themselves ragged by endless touring and recording without a record deal the past few years-- just don't deserve.</p><p>
<em>Burning Birthdays</em> drips with sweat and elbow grease, though the EP is hardly a taxing listen. Despite toting an array of genres and ADHD song structures, the band seamlessly bounces along with the continuity of a stripped-down pop punk band. ""Red Right Hands"" opens with an artsy post-punk guitar line that nearly buries lead singer Lexy Benaim's vocals before melting into a warm, shuffling blues chorus wrapped in 21st century keyboards. Adding some muscle to the band's sound, a wall of backing harmonies supports nearly every song, a secret weapon that works especially effectively on opener ""Carpetbaggers"". While Benaim's thin vocals sometimes feel lost amidst the swirling instrumentation, the rest of the band coats nearly every melodic line on this track with a sunny splash of Beach Boys-style harmonies, elevating a simple ditty into full-fledged power pop anthem.
    </p><p>
    Unlike so many up-and-coming New York bands, the Shakes avoid lingering in one narrow-minded framework. The harmonies may lend themselves to some throwback Spector-era comparisons, and some of the grander choruses may resemble a primordial New Pornographers or Walkmen, but thanks to a frenetic clip of hooks, you can't simply pigeonhole <em>Burning Birthdays</em>. Like a lot of young bands, the Shakes make several impressive nods to their formidable iTunes library, but a distinctive sound hasn't <em>quite</em> jelled yet. While 90% of <em>Burning Birthdays</em> feels like a tangential homage to the band's pet influences, the remaining portion hints at exciting things to come. This five-song combine workout proves the Shakes have the mental and physical tools to succeed at a higher level, but for now they're just blue chip prospects taking all their cues from the pros.

    homepage the fastest, a label like Dischord-- purposefully small, resourceful, and
    geographically focused-- often skates just beneath the world-wide wheel of
    publicity. To wit, while everyone was busy forming a mid-autumn opinion on
    Annuals, White Whale, and Matt &amp; Kim last year, Dischord was busy doing what
    it's done for 27 years: Putting out fine records by District of Columbia bands
    from a small office on Beecher Street. While you were streaming, the Evens,
    Soccer Team (""Traffic Patterns"" kills), and-- most notably-- French Toast released
    largely unbuzzed, very good records. Indeed, elbo.ws reveals exactly </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">one
    </span><span>blog hosted </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">one</span><span> song from French Toast's excellent second album, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ingleside
    Terrace</span><span>. In an even more damnable deed, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ingleside
    Terrace </span><span>was released in October. This is finally our review. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ingleside Terrace</span><span> is no groundbreaking album, but it does represent a
    long step forward in French Toast's short evolution.</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic""> In a Cave</span><span>, French Toast's debut as the duo of James Canty and
    Jerry Busher, was just fine, its ramshackle looseness worn best by Canty's
    imprecise guitar playing splayed out beneath his sociopolitical screeds and
    Busher's convoluted grooves building a base for his weary observations.
    Multi-instrumentalists both, Canty and Busher split drum, bass, guitar and lead
    vocal duties almost exactly in half. That in mind, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">In a Cave </span><span>often felt wobbly and overly stylized. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ingleside Terrace</span><span>,
    though, adds third member and songwriter Ben Gilligan, and that changes
    everything. His thick-tongued flair and proletarian logic (""I'd be better at
    kissing if my teeth were all straight"") supply French Toast with equal parts
    Television thrum (""Take Me All the Way"") and mid-'90s alt.rock jangle (""Settle
    In""). Gilligan's addition gives the rest of the band room to breathe, too.
    Ideas and songs seem fully realized: The pop pops and the sulk sulks, and, over
    12 tracks, three strong, separate, ultimately connected voices emerge. Busher,
    for instance, supplies two of the record's best moments with tracks recorded in
    his bedroom using loops, E-bow, acoustic guitar, keyboards, and tape decks.
    Busher's ""Treason"" and the eerie, perfectly couched rant ""Brejnev"" are the
    least </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">rock</span><span> songs on this record,
    and they seem perfectly comfortable with that rank. Closing track ""Fork in the
    Road""-- a full-band affair with Busher on guitar and James and Brendan Canty
    shaping a taut, automated rhythm-- even lets Busher imply a psychedelic oeuvre to
    French Toast, multiple guitars washing over one another and a stardust of
    staggered, dissonant keyboards.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But French Toast are plenty grounded here: Even as a
    three-piece, they sound leaner and more focused, thanks in no small part to the
    production work of older brother, Fugazi drummer and <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Burn to Shine</span><span> co-founder Brendan Canty. The kiss-off opener ""The
    Letter"" keeps the bros-in-a-basement rough edge intact, but its hinges swing
    better than anything from </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">In a Cave</span><span>,
    low-key three-part harmonies and a simple, driving rhythm invoking Leo at his
    most direct. It's a James Canty track that falls perfectly into ""Protest Sign"",
    a parallel Busher kiss-off that sounds like Mission of Burma throwing its hands
    in the air at political reform. Bad relationships and misguided political
    efforts eschewed by way of introduction, French Toast is free to coalesce as a
    three-piece for the entirety of </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Terrace</span><span>, and that's exactly what they do. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ingleside Terrace</span><span> boasts impeccable pacing, especially for a new
    lineup built on the backs of three divergent songwriters. Sure, they don't have
    a shtick and they don't have a PR machine at their back, but let this humble
    Dischord entry ($10 post-paid and available by mail order, as always) spin more
    than once, and you'll wish it was still October and you ran a blog.<span> </span></span>

    It's no secret: Nowadays, most mainstream rappers aren’t
    rappers. The majority just throw a few bars together around Christmastime before
    getting back to their real hustle, whether it be acting, designing clothes, or
    thinking about how to make Rick Ross the next Biggie Smalls while sitting
    behind a desk in a sharp suit. So when Lil Wayne calls himself the ""best
    rapper alive,"" the claim isn't that controversial-- it increasingly seems like he's one of the <em>only</em>
    rappers alive. And he's pissed (see above).</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    With <em>Hip-Hop Is Dead</em>, Nas tried to resuscitate the culture
    with a hit-and-miss jumble of grumpy nostalgia and over-the-hill
    soul-searching; it was a far cry from indie-rap's nagging grandmother pose, but
    the album didn't hold much hope or promise for the future. With its free-associative, intangible, postmodern pull, <em>Da Drought 3</em>, by
    contrast, sounds a lot like the future. Released on the internet for free, the 29-track, 100-plus minute,
    DJ-less behemoth finds Lil Wayne sidestepping the music industry-- and the
    mixtape industry-- while delivering similes, jokes, and flows by the ton. After
    last year's stunning <em>Dedication 2</em> tape with DJ Drama, <em>Da Drought 3</em> ups the ante
    in almost every way possible.
    </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    To use a distinctly Wayne-ian analogy-- that is, part '80s
    baby trivia, part ridiculous, all true-- the New Orleans
    native is akin to one-time ""American Gladiators"" champion Wesley ""<strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL68dw4Ipxg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Two

    Wayne goes headlong into an
    inherently absurd competitive atmosphere (i.e. modern hip-hop) and dominates.
    He scoots around giants, making the most of his nimble, versatile patter. No
    longer satisfied with being a southern rap ambassador, Wayne emphasizes his
    range with a cross-country, cross-generational, cross-genre beat selection here, from
    the Southern R&amp;B of Ciara's ""Promise"" to the neo-soul of Gnarls
    Barkley's ""Crazy"" to the moody New York bap of Jay-Z's
    ""Dead Presidents II."" It's effortlessly encompassing. Then there's
    the quicksilver flow and morphing subject matter, from the West Coast
    gangsta-isms of ""I'm Blooded"" to the off-the-wall Cam'ron-esque abstractions
    of ""Live from 504"" to the MF Doom-style kitchen talk. No assembly required-- everything to everybody. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    It's fitting, then, for the MC to start the album off
    rhyming over a snap music smash (""This Is Why I'm Hot"") originally
    made by a New York rapper (MIMS)
    trying to pander to a nationwide audience. As if to underline his alien
    mystique (""I am just a Martian, ain't nobody else on this planet""), Wayne
    goes international on the track, working a Jamaican flow simply because he can. Later, while introducing
    his revamp of T.I.'s ""Top Back"", Wayne clarifies, ""T.I. is the king-- don’t get that shit twisted/ And me? I am the
    best rapper alive."" The difference-- divine right vs. tireless
    politicking-- is spelled out through Wayne's
    regional-poaching as high-art stumping. Work, man, <em>work</em>.<span> </span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    At one point, Wayne
    poses the question, ""I'm crazy for bein' Wayne
    or is Wayne just crazy?"" And
    while that chicken/egg query may be unanswerable, there's no doubt Wayne
    makes several insane decisions on <em>Da Drought 3</em>-- choices no other rapper would
    ever consider. Take ""My Daddy"", Wayne's
    spirited defense of his close relationship with surrogate father Brian
    ""Baby"" Williams over Danjahandz's untouchable ""We Takin' Over"" beat. Instead of just ignoring the hubbub, Wayne
    calls attention to it with one of the set's most jaw-dropping tracks. When he
    says, ""Damn right, I kissed my daddy,"" it's not a confession as much
    as a chest-pumping pronouncement, i.e. why don't <em>you</em> kiss <em>your</em> daddy? Then, the
    heartfelt justification: ""Who was there when no one wasn’t? Just my
    daddy."" Finally, Wayne goes
    into light-speed, forgoing typical syntax for a trail of breathless keywords: ""Beef,
    yes, chest, feet, tag, bag, blood, sheets, yikes, yeeks, great, Scott, Storch,
    can I borrow your yacht?"" And just like that, a winning defense turns into a
    staggering offense. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    More zaniness as Wayne gets all MySpace stalker over Ciara's ""Promise"" with a love letter to the Atlanta
    R&amp;B singer that's at once nebbish, cartoony, hilarious, and sweet. ""I
    know that this is pretty awkward for me,"" he mumbles, his typical playboy
    routine neutered by a celebrity crush. Even after countless, detailed blowjob
    verses and rhymes about slipping women pills to get them into bed, the rapper's crazy-in-love yammering (""Nasty as I wanna be or nasty as you like me to be/ I
    hope you like me too now you know I like you too"") somehow still comes off as
    earnest. It's a rare moment when Wayne
    comes down from his interplanetary star-search and joins every other guy who's fallen
    for Ciara's ""Promise"" video. ""That chair or stool move was cool,"" he gushes. Yeah, it was.<span></span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Along with its bounty of blog-worthy one-liners (Wayne can be heard imitating
    Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Bernie Mac and Bobcat Goldthwait across the record)
    and its fascinating internal weed/food cycle (which you can read about in
    Julianne Shepherd's <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/42484-column-interrobang-25"">recent column</a></strong>), this latest opus from Lil Wayne is marked with a beguiling sense of infatuation. The rapper is in love with language, left-field references
    to <em>Gremlins</em> and <em>Harry and the Hendersons</em>, the man who helped raise him, his
    hometown, Ciara and-- even after more than 10 years of professional
    experience-- hip-hop itself: ""I just love music, I love to rap, I love what
    I do,"" he says. That much is clear.

Is the City of Angels the sunny fulfillment of the American dream as portrayed by any number of Hollywood films, or is it the through-the-looking-glass-darkly noir of Raymond Chandler and James Cain? Can the key to the decoding the vast intellectual sprawl be found in quasi-scientific sorcery of L. Ron Hubbard and Aleister Crowley, or in the compromised pop art of Edward Ruscha?</p><p>
    Of course, L.A. is all of the above-- to paraphrase an old tourist slogan: L.A. is where it all comes together, for better or worse. And for the past decade it's also been the home to a burgeoning underground hip-hop/soul/electro scene. Acts such as Flying Lotus, Nobody, Georgia Anne Muldrow, and Guns 'N' Bombs are carving out a niche that will hopefully some day rival the late-50s, early-60s glory years of West Coast free jazz, when musicians such as Ornette Coleman, Eric Dolphy, Don Cherry, and Billy Higgins subverted traditional jazz structure and forever altered that genre's landscape.</p><p>
    And whatever success the current scene has can be traced back, in part, to Stones Throw Records and it twin titans of hip-hop, Peanut Butter Wolf and Madlib. So, the prospect of an L.A. edition of <em>Time Out</em> hosted by that pair looks amazing on paper. Personally, I can't imagine a better person to chronicle the chaotic history of L.A. music better than the Beat Konductor, whose own ADD avant garde aesthetic mirrors the city's restless and on-going search for definition. And while no one is going to mistake Peanut Butter Wolf for a Duck Tours guide, the Stones Throw founder and DJ is affable and witty enough to fulfill his task as subterranean guide.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the package is underwhelming. Sure, PBW's DVD works well enough as a hipster tour guide: He hits all the right spots-- night spots the Social Trust, Cinespace, and Greenlight as well as cool fashion/ culture spots such as Barracuda, Blue Chips, and Suro-- and carries it off with an intimacy and wit that personalizes the entire experience. If you're a PBW groupie, or maybe if going to L.A. for the first time, it's probably required viewing. But honestly, we're not in the business of reviewing DVDs, particularly ones of the travel guide variety. </p><p>
    Which leaves us with Madlib's mix CD. The tagline on here is that the disk is a reflection of Madlib's L.A., but at least half the artists here aren't even from Los Angeles. Dabrye, Jay Dee, Phat Kat, and Cybertron are all from Detroit; Sun Ra hails from Chicago; and the handful of Lee Perry collaborators (the great Prince Jazzbo, Burning Spear drummer Leroy ""Horsemouth"" Wallace) are from Jamaica. Sure, there are some great tracks here. The quirky, windy Mark Murphy track, ""Sly"", produced by Herbie Hancock, is an odd pleasure, while the Outlaw Blues Band delivers an appealing slice of psychedelic blues with ""Deep Gully"". The sporadic insertion of his own tracks, including the exclusive (and mediocre) ""Infinity"", suggests that perhaps Madlib is attempting to trace his own music genealogy. In fact, many tracks hint at Madlib's reckless disregard of traditional song structure. But if self-illumination is the goal, then the CD fails to really highlight the breadth of Madlib's aesthetic. </p><p>
    At best, the disk approximates the dadaist, ramshackle charm of his <em>Blunted in the Bombshelter</em> disk. Both mixes are full of unexplained pans and level tweaks, and stock dialogue makes its way into several songs. But the thing about the <em>Blunted</em> was that at least it had a central point: namely, mixing the Trojan catalog. In the end, the CD is enjoyable yet kinda pointless. It feels as if Madlib spent 30 seconds in between bong packs assembling a playlist. Sure, you could do worse, but Madlib could also do better.</p></div>"|10227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10227-time-out-presents-the-other-side-los-angeles/|6.0|Sam Chennault

    I was pretty sure I liked Sweden's Hello Saferide for her
    lyrics, mostly. Under that name, singer/songwriter Annika Norlin's 2006 U.S. debut, <em>Introducing...</em>, set out a personality that won me over like late-night conversations with
    a new close friend-- full of warmth, humor, and the kind of gnawing insecurities that tend
    to interest me more than caricatured angst or weepy bathos. Instead of asking
    what drew me in about her almost defiantly direct indie pop sound, I found
    myself wondering how her words managed to make her come across as some kind of Scandinavian kindred
    spirit, and whether other people would be moved in the same subtle way.</p><p>
    So of course, Norlin's latest album is entirely in Swedish.</p><p>
    A
    language barrier hasn't stopped Pitchfork's growing cohort of Swede fanciers from drooling all over groups like Dungen and Vapnet (honorable mench: [ingenting]),
    just as it didn't stop many of us from digging the Welsh-language outings of
    Super Furry Animals or Gorky's Zygotic Mynci a decade earlier. Still, I wasn't sure I'd get as excited about a Norlin record without being able to
    understand her touchingly weird words about AltaVista
    stalking, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and those first nervous steps toward true human intimacy.
    </p>
<p>
    Needn't have worried. On Norlin's Swedish-language debut
    as Säkert! (literally, ""Safe!""), she's back with more of her alternately giddy and aching fresh-air pop, shading the AM-friendly side of the 60s through a post-Sarah Records lens to sit alongside the likes of Sambassadeur, Vapnet, or Acid
    House Kings. Perhaps producer Henrik Oja of ""outlaw
    mutation boogie"" band the Spacious Mind enlivens Norlin's aesthetic with
    an outsider's touch, after another fragile popster, Niccokick's Andreas
    Söderlund, produced <em>Introducing...</em> Still,
    the Skittles-colored arrangements here are merely whizzbang fancier, not really much
    different: acoustic and electric guitars, keyboards, piano, tambourine,
    glockenspiel, and touches of programming, Rhodes,
    or quirkier instrumentation like accordion or clarinet.</p><p>
    Odds are Norlin's frank voice and candy-twirling melodies explain
    more of what I like about her songs than I'd ever expected. First single
    ""Vi Kommer Att Dö Samtidigt"" (""We're Going
    to Die at the Same Time, You and I"", according to an English-language <strong><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/theanimalfiveplease"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a></strong> version) certainly suggests as much, even
    though I now know its peppiness matches a lyric about friendship that's not nearly as
    creepy as its title suggests-- or, creepy in a cute way, at least. Norlin's
    electro-pop duet with Markus Krunegard from Laakso can stand up with
    countryfolk Club 8, and her pairing with Vapnet's Martin Hanberg, ""Sanningsdan"",
    is as head-noddingly catchy as tracks like that band's ""Rådhusgatan"". <br/></p>
<p>
    While a clutch of faster songs recall the infectious energy
    of Hello Saferide's ""My Best Friend"", slower piano waltz ""Ditt Kvarter"" comes closer
    to the quiet charm of Canadian folk-popper
    Christine Fellows' ""Paper Anniversary"". Clarinet-driven ""Du Kanske Var På Holmön"" evokes
    the eerie hangover of <em>Introducing...</em>'s
    ""Saturday Nights"". Finally, spare closer ""Är Du Fortfarande Arg?"" is
    reminiscent of the first Norlin song I ever heard, ""The Quiz"", and at last makes me start copying the lyric sheet into online translators--
    to little avail. ""If I blush when I sing, that's good,"" Norlin has
    said of the lyric-writing process behind Säkert! (at least, that's my best translation). That blush was part of what caused her English-language
    songs to glow, but for now just the sound of <em>Säkert! </em>might be enough.

    Has there ever been a guitar hero with a more misleading moniker than David
    Torn? With his violent, evocative surname, you expect Torn to really shred, to
    take that fretboard and rip it to pieces. And he does that, but not the way you
    might expect. His is a more considered virtuosity, a style that stresses mood
    and amorphous cloud technique over light-speed pyrotechnics. Torn doesn't rip.
    He weaves, he pulls, he draws.</p><p>
    ""Why would a first-rate guitarist want to sound like a third-rate
    saxophonist?"" someone once asked, rhetorically, of guitar-synth whiz Alan
    Holdsworth. While no less adept at transforming his axe into something else,
    Torn has taken a more tasteful tack. He comes from the Robert Fripp and Michael
    Brook school of style and discipline, which is why his playing has been
    enlisted so often as backdrops for film scores and for experimental-minded pop
    stars like David Sylvian and Bowie.</p><p>
<em>Prezens</em> marks Torn's return to ECM, for whom he recorded his
    breakthrough <em>Cloud About Mercury</em>, for the first time in over two
    decades. He's joined on the disc by the capable team of Tim Berne on alto sax,
    Tom Rainey on drums, and Craig Taborn on keys, who as a trio comprise Berne's
    Hard Cell but here fill out Torn's ranks as a full-fledged (albeit bass-free)
    jazz quartet. Not that ""jazz"" really does the music justice. If only
    it were that simple.
    </p>
<p>
    Part of the fun of <em>Prezens</em> is dissecting its various components,
    especially given such a shape-shifting presence as Torn. While there's no
    confusing Torn with Berne (one of the best skronkers in the business) or
    Rainey, he and Taborn seem to be sharing duties when it comes to harder-to-place
    sci-fi effects and general otherworldly sounds, at least until the inevitable
    fireworks erupt.
    </p>
<p>
    When they do, several minutes into the first track ""Ak"", the
    effect is a brief but shining free-for-all, a jazz-blues jam where the players
    are encouraged to step on each other's toes. Yet nobody trips. They understand
    how to give one another just enough room to navigate, and when they do overlap,
    they do so sympathetically, with each instrument supporting the other in
    sometimes surprising ways.
    </p>
<p>
    It's Torn and Taborn who provide the bulk of the atmosphere in ""Rest
    &amp; Unrest"", which brings to mind what the Orb might have sounded like
    as a jazz outfit. But it's Torn and Berne who start out with the mood-setting
    in ""Structural Functions of Prezens"", an epic track that sounds
    almost aimless and wistful until Rainey takes over, his snare cracks and cymbal
    crashes like the patter of rain on the windowsill during a heavy storm.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Bulbs"" drifts closer to prog territory, not unlike some of the
    more recent iterations and side projects of King Crimson, the sound of the 21st
    century schizoid man taking his meds, mellowing out a little, then suddenly
    realizing he took the wrong pills before really freaking out. ""Sink""
    briefly brings the funk before shifting in and out of phase, making room for a
    serpentine guitar solo that sets Torn adrift in a sea of electro-acoustic
    strangeness before bringing it all back to a warped kitchen-sink groove.
    </p>
<p>
    The epic ""Neck-Deep in the Harrow..."" is another great example of how
    the players can balance staying busy without cluttering up their music, the
    compositions shifting and tilting every few minutes. Noir atmosphere. Metallic
    outbursts. Drowsy space music. Blues dirges. Dubby detours. Electronic
    deconstruction. Lesser musicians might have gotten lost up their own asses.
    Torn and his band make all these twists and turns make sense, and tracks like
    the syncopated album closer ""Transmit Regardless"" give recent
    Radiohead a run for their money.
    </p>
<p>
    Track after track, the same questions are raised: What are those low groans
    that keep bubbling up from the depths? Is that Torn sounding like a flute, or
    Taborn? (Or, for that matter, Berne?) And who's in charge of the digital
    distortion? How much is live? How much is looped? How much is composed, how
    much is improvised, and how much was pieced together after the fact, Teo Macero
    style?
    </p>
<p>
    In one sense, you can only answer these questions watching the group's live
    interplay, in the flesh. On disc, the best you can say is that whatever they're
    up to and whoever's doing it, it sounds right, so it's best to just go with it.
    Indeed, <em>Prezens</em> provides ample proof that you needn't be traveling at
    top speed before everything becomes a blur, and that a blur can often be just
    as beguiling and beautiful as more sharply defined trips. Just be sure to put
    on your thinking cap and hold on tight.

The tricks and tenets of the form have been so integrated into different realms of music production that they're simply part of the weather. Disembodied echoes, horizontal smears, transfigurations of details into plot-points and vice versa-- all such things are base elements that owe to the days when reggae producers started wondering what might be hiding between the wires in their mixing desks.</p><p>
    It would be hard to overstate the importance of dub in electronic music, but it's also easy to take for granted. Part of that owes to how literally dub gets invoked by those most closely associated with it: When the likes of Pole or Rhythm &amp; Sound show their devotion to the dub methodology they hold dear, it tends to come out sounding more or less like re-versioned reggae. Drums fan out over bulbous bass-lines, tempos skew slow, melodies grow lazy and warm, and so on.</p><p>
    Sasu Ripatti is less literal. Under his working guises as Luomo, Uusitalo, and Vladislav Delay, the Finnish producer has allied with dub as both a method and a mindset. It starts with the interrelation of his three personae, which itself functions as a sort of dub gesture. But it's most evident in the way he trips and rubs each and every element of his sound as it transpires, whether under the schedule of house (cf. Luomo), techno (Uusitalo), or dub that wanders out of line.</p><p>
    The last one is what plays on <em>Whistleblower</em>, the eighth album credited to Vladislav Delay. The sounds are the same as they've always been: miasmic synth tones, rubbery kick-drums that stutter and tap, weird whirligigs given to tumbling around what could well be a big washing machine filled with an irradiated syrup of significant thickness. They're basically the same sounds that Ripatti mines as Luomo and Uusitalo, minus any veritable rites of rhythm.</p><p>
    As Luomo has grown evermore sensuous and inviting, the common knock against the work of Delay is that it's all a big tease. (Who could resist the desire to hear Luomo when he's so close at hand?) But while the tease does in fact taunt in tracks that rarely build beyond a lumbering yawn, the Luomo aura helps as much as it hurts, mostly by making Delay's dubby hesitations and ambient lack of pacing resonante all the more for the decisions they imply. When a series of pounding sounds wanders into a 12-minute track like “Wanted To (Kill)"", what initially scans as arbitrary carpentry noise falls into a hypnotic pulse, in part because you're listening for it. Likewise the barely-suggested sound of a voice cut up in ""Stop Talking""-- the mere chance that it might turn into a lush chorus in the fashion of Luomo makes it sneak into an ear all the deeper.</p><p>
    That's not to say that <em>Whistleblower</em> isn't worthwhile on its own terms. Few producers have as varied a store of sounds to draw on as Ripatti. And he never just plugs them in, which proves all the more evident when he's at his slowest and most patient. It's a wonder to hear how he tweaks and customizes every little fidget in ""I Saw a Polysexual,"" just as it's stirring to hear when he pulls back to haunt in ""Lumi."" You could fashion a Venn diagram to make sense of the effects as they relate to Luomo and Uusitalo, or you could just draw a circle and stay inside.</p></div>"|10209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10209-whistleblower/|7.1|Andy Battaglia

    Marc Bolan may be dead, but Battles can rebuild him. They have the technology. On ""Atlas"", the second track on the band's debut album, drummer John Stanier's pistons pump out a steroidal version of Bolan's trademark shuffling stomp-beat. His three bandmates-- Ian Williams, Dave Konopka, and Tyondai Braxton-- constrict their two-note keyboards and one-note guitars until the song  coalesces into a stiff, slick, swinging robot rock. It's like a skills-exchange workshop where mechanically minded krautrockers are encouraged to share their knowledge with remedial class glam bands only interested in big beat thrills. And as the almost-club-friendly single, it's the perfect introduction to the rest of <em>Mirrored</em>, easing you into the album's mix of over-the-top whimsy, extreme analogue rhythms that are often as much jazz-fusion as IDM as tech-metal, vocals that would do Roger Troutman proud, and vise-tight, ""live or laptop?"" musicianship connected as much by USB ports and Firewire cables as the improvisatory interplay of four dudes just jamming.<font face=""Arial"" size=""2""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial""></span></font></p><p>
    In fact, Battles may be the first band to really play
    with the way that 21st century software can extend and distend the sound of a
    rock band in real time; <em><span style=""font-style: italic"">Mirrored</span></em> moves
    in ways that Battles' first two instrumental EPs--post-rock played with the
    locked-down seriousness of modern techno--only suggested. Early Battles shows could
    sound like a metal band performing Steve Reich's <em><span style=""font-style: italic"">Music for 18 Musicians</span></em>, and <em><span style=""font-style: italic"">Mirrored</span></em>
    spurns solos, favoring a caffeinated maximalism where compositions are built
    out of 100 microscopic parts. The guitarist/keyboardists string together tracks
    out of riffs that crisscross with the careful preplanning of a subway system.
    Each instrument on opening track ""Race In""-- Stanier's
    military-precise massed snares, the guitars tensely climbing up and down a few
    notes, what sound like synthetic tubular bells-- is added with the deliberate
    patience of a Terry Riley composition. The song feels nervously repetitive,
    like it's suffering from OCD.</p><p>
    If you've seen Battles live, you've probably seen the phrase ""ex-members of"" written on the flyer, and so maybe none of this surprises you. Save Stanier, everyone in Battles is a multi-instrumentalist, playing a prog album's worth of guitars, electronics, and/or keyboards. Braxton's put in time splitting the difference between IDM and avant-garde electronics; Konopka played with underrated indie instrumentalists Lynx, Stanier drummed for scholastic-metal pioneers Helmet; Williams finger-tapped for Don Caballero. But while there's certainly more than a shade of math rock's intricacy on <em>Mirrored</em>, tracks like the terse, tambourine-rattling quasi-funk of ""Tonto"" or Stanier's time-signature and tempo fuckery on the crescendo-crazed ""Tij"", the stern stuff is continually undercut by a vibe that's more romper room than po-faced. The ""hook"" on ""Race In"" is a whistle-while-you-work chant that they're probably humming down at Fraggle Rock. The astounding ""Rainbow"" spins into dizzying Rube Goldberg corkscrews of keyboard, xylophone, and giddily speed-attenuated symphonic metal drums. It sounds like the band is trying to recreate the Looney Tunes cartoon where Bugs and Daffy are dueling orchestra conductors, each driving their ensembles to crazier and crazier call-and-response peaks.
    </p>
<p>
    And what makes <em>Mirrored</em>'s merry melodies really stand out isn't the crazy quilt structures or needlepoint precision of the playing. It's the frenzied gibberish of Braxton's pitch-shifted and electronically processed vocals-- a kind of ecstatic robot that's speaking in cartoon tongues. When ""Atlas"" dropped a few months back, those vocals were a squeaky line in the sand for old fans, and across the internet, everyone had the same thought: ""Why are Battles suddenly aping the Animal Collective?"" But Avey Tare and company hardly invented high-pitched sing-song vocals-- just ask David Seville. On ""Leyendecker"", Braxton croons in a falsetto that's been whipped up by technology until it sounds like a neutered D'Angelo. Combined with the music, a low-res quasi-R&amp;B beat as grainy as a glitch track, Braxton's circuitry pushes ""Leyendecker"" into far stranger places than any the Collective has wandered into. Throughout <em>Mirrored</em> he shreds his vocals with the post-human glee of Warp labelmate Jackson and His Computer Band, whether it's the joyful opening burst of voice on ""Ddiamondd"" that spits pitch-bent consonants, or ""Tij"", where Braxton pants and wheezes in a creeped-out asthmatic lower-register. You couldn't even approximate ""Leyendecker"", or any of <em>Mirrored</em>'s 11 tracks, with just acoustic guitars and voices.

<p>
    At the same time, listen closely to the intro to ""Atlas"" and you'll hear the pedal on Stanier's kit hitting the kickdrum in the physical world of the studio, pushing air as the hammer connects with the skin. Even when reminiscent of the unfeasible programming of post-drill'n'bass electronica, Battles' spastic drums are being played in real time, with the brute force and metronome-focus of a guy with a background in heavy rock. But its avant-pop hooks and ultrabrite melodies are being dissembled and reassembled by pitiless CPUs in equally real time. It's thrilling and disorienting because the virtuosity of both man and machine means that, unlike earlier rock/techno hybrids hampered by both technically unskilled players and crude technology, Battles sound is indivisible. Battles may not be the world's first bionic rock group, but they've done more to extend the idea of a flesh-and-blood band enhanced by computer technology than anyone since the late, lamented Disco Inferno. <em>Mirrored</em> is a breathtaking aesthetic left-turn that sounds less like rock circa 2007 than rock circa 2097, a world where Marshall stacks and micro-processing go hand in hand.

    ""Meet me outside the skating rink/ Your mom is a bitch/ I
    don't care what she thinks/ Of me."" When Ladyhawk frontman Duffy Driediger
    barreled into ""Teenage Love Song""-- the most endearing 150 seconds on the
    band's self-titled 2006 debut-- with those words, you could have sworn
    Southern rock had a new poet laureate, still wet behind the ears and
    punch-drunk with enthusiasm. The best part of that idea, though, was knowing
    that Ladyhawk was from Vancouver, British Columbia, a Canadian port city with one of the highest costs of living in the world. The most essential music from
    the southeastern portion of the United States has long been united by the same
    sense of exposed nerves and uncloaked emotions, as integral to the songs as the
    sounds themselves. Neither Lynyrd Skynyrd, Sam Cooke, nor Superchunk hedged bets
    for subtlety's sake or pursued passivity for passion. On both their sweeping
    debut and the vinyl-only, six-track follow-up <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fight for Anarchy</span><span>, Ladyhawk (like their Canadian predecessors the Band
    and Neil Young) haven't either. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fight for Anarchy </span><span>offers
    a different approach toward their same humid feelings. While nine of the 10
    tracks on </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ladyhawk</span><span> were
    straightforward, electric-guitar marches, five of the six tracks here are
    rooted in piano or acoustic guitar. That's not to say </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fight</span><span> is more docile: In fact, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fight for Anarchy</span><span> is the most musically aggressive batch of Ladyhawk
    songs yet, in terms of both musicianship and production. ""Boy You Got Another Thing
    Coming"" is a downtrodden, bitter fuck-you to the girl that left guitarist Darcy
    Hancock lonesome, high, and dry. He's backed by wailing cello, ramshackle
    acoustic guitars, and commiserating harmonies until two minutes in, when he
    funnels his emotional damage through a minute-long, razor-thin knife of
    feedback posing as a solo. He's out to damage his heartbreaker's hearing, and,
    when the track limps to the finish line, his punishment is the only thing left
    standing. Closer ""You Ran"" sounds like a Carey Mercer nod, the heavy strum of a
    barely tuned acoustic guitar and Driediger's shouting-down-the-hallway vocals
    nearly overloading the microphone. The band bleeds at track's end into a great
    sonic mess, unintelligible moans, smeared guitars and a sole clattering drum
    bashing against each other. Ladyhawk are still singing about loving women,
    bearing busted hearts, and running wild, but they didn't take these chances
    before.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The risks work only in clips, though. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fight for Anarchy</span><span> was recorded in one session
    between tours, and imperfections remain exposed all over the place, with
    aberrant beats, notes and tones popping from every song's surface. While the
    same could be said of Neil Young's </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Tonight's the Night</span><span>, those flaws were bolstered by a devastating
    emotional gravity (a member of Crazy Horse and a roadie had just died of
    heroin) and some of the best songs Young has written. Here, Ladyhawk just
    sounds alternately mad, sad, and stoned, and most of </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fight for Anarchy</span><span> runs only like a sketchbook for what could have
    been. ""Boy"" and the 45-second acoustic interlude ""Amber Jam"" are endearing
    enough; however, opening quick takes on ""War"" and ""If You Run"" seem like wasted
    statements warranting a little more preparation.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But what <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fight for Anarchy</span><span> lacks in absolute worth it makes up for in potential: Sonically,
    lyrically, and structurally, Ladyhawk are restless here, proclaiming that they've
    got more to offer than the ragged, social-renegade rock they wore so well on
    last year's debut, even if they're still sorting through the kinks of making
    outsider interests coalesce around Driediger's beer-breath anthems (they are).
    Interestingly, the two Canadian acts whose raucous Southern nature is reflected
    in Ladyhawk's raw-nerve tendencies-- the Band and Young-- had the same
    problem: Robbie Robertson has long said that he felt the need to shelter the
    Band from his interest in 20th century composition, and Young hit the biggest
    brick walls of his career when his experimental reach far exceeded his grasp.
    But Ladyhawk are of a different time and place, when dissonance and abstraction
    aren't mere avant artifacts or obtuse anathema. Somewhere between Frog Eyes'
    saturated northern sprees and My Morning Jacket's distended southern rails,
    Ladyhawk will eventually find their place: </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Fight for Anarchy</span><span> doesn't quite put them there, and that's OK. They've
    proven they have the interest and energy, if you'll just give them time.</span>

    This Danish quintet's first full-length release on Home Tapes is a full
    of dark and radiant songs that compete and unite at equal turns.
    The album opens with the peaceful, anemic bombast of ""Sleep Tight"",
    its winds and strings chugging through crashes of cymbals
    and bass. An ominous chorus of voices enforces a marching cadence, but
    the precision breaks midway for guitars and distant howls reminiscent of Animal
    Collective's <em>Campfire Songs</em>.</p><p>
    Incorporating so many instrument families into one sound is difficult, and Slaraffenland have
    some trouble with ""Show Me the Way"", which ineffectively plods and
    floats with punches of saxophone and trombone and flits of guitar and drum. At only two minutes it never quite lures us in, but it's the only
    track that doesn't.  ""The Run Up"" is another
    softhearted interlude that coaxes the ear with soft harmonies and the powerful
    foundation of brass in low registers. ""This One Will Kill Us"" starts
    with a disappointingly rote guitar intro, but gives way to an aquatic dirge of
    twinkling guitars and a suffocating saxophone. It's an immensely evocative
    atmosphere, and devolves back to post-punk for the close, creating our slow,
    drawn out shock that these two sounds can come from the same band.</p><p>
    The minor key of ""Roed"", with its squirming hint of synth and
    elongated guitar static, makes for a darker mood we only hear in brief segments of
    other songs. But this song is also a conclusive chapter to the death march of
    ""Sleep Tight"". As an antidote, the following ""Watch Out""
    gives us a trombone set to a percussion section-- unusual on this album, where
    guitars and cymbals often mark the beat. The tinge of post-punk shout-outs in
    the lyrics (""You better watch out"" is hollered intermittently) make
    pretty good sense, as all the other instruments are similarly content to wow us
    with surprise: they skulk creepily, or suddenly arrive and recede. Even this
    song's gorgeous climax is understated, the brass rolling around in chaotic
    scales, guitars whining in the reverbed background-- but no instrument too
    loud, and none abrasive.
    </p>
<p>
    It's easy to imagine Slaraffenland scoring a film or an installation-- their
    rendition of the title subject on ""Ghosts"" is spot on, bringing in a
    mix of soft, textured aural luxury with ominous industrialized beats. Here, in
    a story-like arrangement, the first mood builds to the highly effected second,
    instead of sandwiching the noise within the calm as happens frequently in
    previous songs. The album as a whole is a brave perambulation, drawing on the
    acidic thunderstorms and gorgeous lullabies of two great Icelandic exports
    (Björk on ""You Win"" and Sigur Rós for aching closer ""How Far
    Would You Go""). In music, it's not often that this borderline
    overindulgence, where structure and uniformity are all but forgotten, works.
    But here the members of Slaraffenland showcase their virtuoso skills and
    shared vision, always modestly.

    Vocalist John Gleason and guitarist Jeremy Benson wrote the Roadside Graves' first song, ""Song for a Dry State"", following a cross-country road trip to Utah. And judging from the New Jersey group's vibrant third album <em>No One Will Know Where You've Been</em>, that's hardly the last time they've drawn inspiration with a little help from Rand McNally. The album showcases the Roadside Graves' affection for the American landscape-- both physical and musical-- and hearkens back to the days when long-distance drivers were at the mercy of whichever classic rock or country station carried the strongest signal, and those lonely instances when a well-timed selection from Creedence, George Jones, or the Band might make your whole evening.</p><p>
    After beginning life as a trio, for the bulk of <em>No One Will Know Where You've Been</em>, the Roadside Graves have settled in as a versatile seven-piece outfit. Thanks largely to the band's Jersey roots and Mike DeBlasio's dramatic contributions on piano and organ, this lineup all but guarantees a few unavoidable E-Street echoes. But their sweet-tempered country-rock is far more slippery than it might first appear, buffered as it is by rich Jayhawks vocal harmonies, Benson's quicksilver guitar leads, and frequent detours that can occasionally conjure images of a roadhouse Bad Seeds. These unexpected instrumental flourishes serve well to illuminate the intimate psychic geography that Gleason ambitiously maps out in his lyrics.</p><p>
    ""If California didn't end, you'd still be driving around,"" Gleason sings to the wayward characters that populate ""If California Didn't End"", one of several examples in his lyrics where lives and plans are forcibly reconfigured by the facts on the ground. This theme is repeated on the album's best track, the triumphant ""West Coast"", a bittersweet tribute to family and the heart's resilience. ""I've got a heart that won't quit, won't break/ no matter what you do"" the Graves sing together, with a passion and vitality that quashes any hint of melodrama, the irresistible chorus framed perfectly by Benson's sun-drizzled, Jerry Garcia guitar. 
    </p>
<p>
    Elsewhere, the album's shades can take a darker hue, as on the cheerfully macabre ""Women in Black"", which finds the Roadside Graves taking their name rather literally with a car-crash narrative that nearly skirts into ""Teen Angel"" territory. And on the folk-like ballad ""The Black Hills"", Gleason further internalizes the details of the American topography, repeating ""She walks the Black Hills for me"" with a baleful gravity. These gloomier passages are balanced out by the presence of spirited, sawdust-floor country numbers like the rollicking ""Man at Every Port"" or ""Stranger"", whose closing guitar jam should easily gather the My Morning Jacket faithful into the congregation. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""I've drank enough to know that I've drank enough,"" announces Gleason on the world-weary ""Live Slow"", the one track that seemingly comes closest to encapsulating the enduring spirit behind <em>No One Will Know Where You've Been.</em> Performed with an uncommonly deft touch and subtle grace, these songs concern themselves primarily with the pause for breath that comes after reaching their original destinations, and the long, careful glance at the atlas that should come before determining what exactly is supposed to happen next.

    New Orleans-born, Chicago-residing duo Telefon Tel Aviv introduced their
    limpid post-rock blend of digital blips and organic murmurs on 2001's <em>Fahrenheit
    Fair Enough</em>. In 2004, second album <em>Map of What Is Effortless</em> took
    them beyond instrumentals, but their songs didn't always live up to their
    soundscapes. That shouldn't be a problem on <em>Remixes Compiled</em>, which
    collects seven years of the duo's work remixing other people's songs and serves
    as a decent introduction to Telefon Tel Aviv's singular brand of glitchy,
    melodic chillout music.</p><p>
    This is a remixer's remix compilation. Telefon Tel Aviv's remixes are all
    extensions of a common aesthetic, a fact that's particularly remarkable if you
    grew up with the idea of these comps as schizophrenic cash-ins full of your
    favorite rock group's DJ-tweaked B-sides. Quick-pan beats, twinkling acoustic
    guitars, and warm synths put the Telefon Tel Aviv stamp on songs by artists as
    disparate as Nine Inch Nails (a percussive, previously unreleased mix of <em>The
    Fragile</em>'s ""Even Deeper"") and, one track later, Bebel Gilberto
    (transporting Gilberto's loneliness contemplation ""All Around"" into
    the lonelier void of outer space). A remake of Oliver Nelson's ""Stolen
    Moments"" gives the jazz-blues classic's melody to a Loyola University
    Chamber Orchestra subtly beset by computerized dentist drills, memorably
    combining old and new. A sensitive, Rhodes-washed version of Apparat's lap-pop
    anthem ""Komponent"" also carries the Telefon Tel Aviv signature.</p><p>
    Still, <em>Remixes Compiled</em> shows only glints of the heightened intensity
    that occasionally peeked out from the duo's typically more reserved tones on
    their last album. An exception is the compilation's concluding remix of
    ""Knock Me Down"" by Hefty label head John Hughes' Slicker project.
    Here, the electro-funk original's fatherly mantra-- ""You are my only
    girl,"" vocalist Khadijah Anwar soothingly proclaims-- juts out from quiet
    beginnings into a thorny tangle of distortion and dying synths. A previously
    unreleased take on American Analog Set's ""The Green Green Grass"" also
    has a big, noisy chorus and a bit of the vitality of <em>Map of What Is
    Effortless</em>'s quirky ""My Week Beats Your Year"".
    </p>
<p>
    Most times, <em>Remixes Compiled </em>is content merely to maintain the duo's
    restrained cool, whether amid ringing synths and distant horns in a mix of
    Hughes' ""Got Me Lost/ Driving in LA"", or human-breath percussion and
    late-night electric piano on a version of AmmonContact's ""BBQ Plate"".
    Much as on the albums, the songs don't always live up to the sounds (Nitrada's
    breathily sung ""Fading Away"" is just one not particularly memorable
    example). But one hopes this clear view of where Telefon Tel Aviv have been
    will give the duo inspiration for how to refine their approach still further on
    albums-- and remixes-- yet to come.

    Jeff Tweedy's restlessness has always been one of his greatest strengths. Since Wilco's inception more than a decade ago, his willingness to explore an ever-widening spectrum of sounds and genres, and to keep the revolving door of the band's line-up well-oiled, has paid off in a discography that's as diverse as it is indispensable. Though his songwriting DNA was bound tight during the later days of Uncle Tupelo, Tweedy has nurtured it in different ways with each successive album, from the transitional sunset country-rock of the first two, through the keyboard-thick pop of <em>Summerteeth</em>, the fractured deconstructions of <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em>, and the languid abstractions of <em>A Ghost Is Born</em>. Following that last record, Wilco swelled to its largest and (according to Tweedy himself) best lineup ever, with the addition of guitar hero Nels Cline and utilityman Pat Sansone. Charged up and bursting with eccentric and experimental talent, Wilco Mk. 5 seemed poised to generate the band's finest-- or at least most interesting-- music yet. Instead, it produced <em>Sky Blue Sky</em>.</p><p>
    An album of unapologetic straightforwardness, <em>Sky Blue Sky</em> nakedly exposes the dad-rock gene Wilco has always carried but courageously attempted to disguise. Never has the band sounded more passive, from the direct and domestic nature of Tweedy's lyrics, to the soft-rock-plus-solos format (already hinted at on <em>Ghost</em>'s ""At Least That's What You Said"" and ""Hell Is Chrome"") that most of its songs adhere to. The lackluster spirit even pervades the song titles: ""Shake It Off"" is probably most accurate (not to mention the album's worst track), but ""On and On and On"" and ""Please Be Patient With Me"" are both strong alternatives.</p><p>
    It's hard to contest Tweedy's headspace in the making of <em>Sky Blue Sky</em>-- the record's themes of exhaustion and hesitantly returning to normalcy are particularly resonant in the wake of his recent rehabilitation. Perhaps it's just a shame that the music fits the message so well; just as the chaos and space of <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> fit with that record's message of communication breakdown, <em>Sky Blue Sky</em>'s soothing classic rock elements feel like a desperate pursuit of comfort. Even the noisy guitar interludes (often led by Tweedy rather than Cline) play a dramatic role, absorbing the frustrations Tweedy must have accumulated during all the difficult moments documented in the record's lyrics. 
    </p>
<p>
    Among <em>Sky Blue Sky</em>'s most distressing attributes is its misuse of the experimentalist weapons at Tweedy's command: drummer Glenn Kotche is given no room to stretch beyond routine time-keeping, and Cline is used for his capacity to rip and wail rather than his ear for texture and atmosphere. Case in point, the drowsy opener ""Either Way"" sleepwalks through a list of indecisive sentiments (""maybe you love me, maybe you don't"") before breaking for a Cline solo that's straight-up Weather Channel Local on the 8s. Elsewhere the sextet lineup tends to overplay what should be a collection of fragile, lonesome material. Multiple songs (""Impossible Germany"", ""Walken"") end up in multi-guitar Skynyrd jam sessions or <em>White Album</em> aspirations (""Hate It Here"") that sound more homage than heartfelt. Meanwhile, quiet moments such as ""Leave Me (Like You Found Me)"" are marred from being delicate <em>Being There</em> throwbacks by excessive noodling and Tweedy's passive-aggressive self-pity.
    </p>
<p>
    On the other hand, ""Side With the Seeds"" is the rare track where the new band demonstrates its chops without getting in the way of the song. With a soulful vocal, intertwined piano and organ, and guitar conversations that build to melodic peaks over a loosely swinging Kotche drumbeat, it's way jambandy, but epic and triumphant nonetheless. And speaking of the granola crowd, the acoustic simplicity and warm harmonies of ""What Light"" make it the <em>American Beauty</em> nod that Wilco's always been itching to play, even if the song title calls for an exclamation point (or at least a question mark) and is sung with an indifferent period. 
    </p>
<p>
    For a band who can credit a hefty part of their charm to always thinking they're weirder than they actually are, stripping away the disconnect between Wilco's earthy adult-alternative center and their more recent ambitious aspirations-- whether they're exploring Krautrock, breaking into a Sonic Youth freakout, or sabotaging a song's structure-- reveals a fairly traditional band that's emerged from their ""weird"" phase a markedly less interesting group than they were before they entered it. Perhaps after giving the band-member carousel another spin, Tweedy merely ended up with the wrong personnel to articulate his mood here. If that's the case-- as long as his restless habits hold-- we may only need to wait one more album for message and messenger to click back into alignment.

    Joe Strummer lived just long enough to see his luster
    fade. You can't read a Strummer profile nowadays without a snide mention of his
    privileged upbringing, backhanded accusations of opportunism, or some sneaky
    assault on his revolutionary man-of-the-people credentials. Some have even gone
    so far as to suggest that Strummer was a secret admirer of Margaret Thatcher, or at
    least a politically ambivalent populist.</p><p>
    If there's anything Joe Strummer made clear right up to
    his untimely death, it's that he loved life and loved the world, and all it had to
    offer. He was an idealist who embraced diversity in art with the same arms that
    embraced diversity of opinion-- the same arms he sometimes raised to
    defend the things he held sacred and assail the things he found offensive.
    Strummer fought the good fight not as a rigid dogmatist or a didactic preacher
    but as an optimist who at his heart hoped for everyone to feel the enthusiasm he
    radiated on record, on stage, or on the radio.</p><p>
    Strummer himself best sums up his appeal in an
    interview excerpted on <em>The Future Is Unwritten</em>, a soundtrack tribute to
    Strummer by way of his songs and the songs he liked, timed to a new Julien
    Temple documentary of the same name. ""Joe, we're going to have your name
    up on screen,"" goes the TV producer. ""Would you like anything under
    your name? Would you like 'Mescaleros' or 'The Clash' ...?"" he asks,
    trailing off. ""I'd like you to write 'Punk Rock Warlord,'"" deadpans
    Strummer in response, without missing a beat. ""With 'Warlord' being one
    word."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Joe Strummer didn't care what anyone thought of him-- probably punk's most basic, honest position, though one unlikely to endear him
    to all. ""I don't care to belong to a club that accepts people like me
    as members,"" quipped Groucho Marx, a man as likely a hero to
    Strummer as that other Marx. And, as <em>The Future is Unwritten</em> attests, he was
    a complicated man, if not necessarily conflicted, something this disc points out
    by way of several jarring juxtapositions. 
    </p>
<p>
    A ragged demo of ""White Riot"", which opens with Strummer's a cappella shouting, rubs up against Rachid Taha's recent cover
    of ""Rock the Casbah"", only to be followed by two of Strummer's favorite songs:
    Elvis Presley's ""Crawfish"" and Tim Hardin's ""Black Sheep
    Boy"". After a soundbite in which Strummer explains the epiphany-like
    effect of the 1968 cultural revolution and a spin of the MC5's ""Kick Out
    the Jams"", the disc shifts to his own pre-Clash response to
    changing musical trends: ""Keys to Your Heart"", an innocent little number performed by his pub-rock band the 101ers. 
    </p>
<p>
    From here the compilation shifts to the Clash era, which any
    fan of the always-evolving band knows drew from wildly disparate ends of the
    musical spectrum, and didn't stay stereotypically ""punk"" for very
    long. To whit, <em>The Future Is Unwritten</em> includes tracks from U-Roy and
    Ernest Ranglin, Bob Dylan doing ""Corrina, Corrina"", Nina Simone covering the Bee Gees' ""To Love Somebody"", and Eddie Cochran's ""Nervous
    Breakdown"", all simmering somewhere in the Clash's gumbo. 
    </p>
<p>
    As a full portrait of the band, however, the
    selection is naturally less rounded than, say, MOJO's ""Radio Clash"" freebie
    from a few years back. But as a snapshot of Strummer's particular influences--
    which in turn rolled into the Clash-- it at least provides a little
    perspective. For example, the Clash's cover of ""Armagideon Times""
    (included here) may not be as iconic as Willie Williams' original, but it's
    certainly credible, in no small part due to Strummer's enthusiastic delivery. 
    </p>
<p>
    The tragedy of Joe Strummer, of course, is that little
    of his post-Clash work stood up to his previous high-water marks, and that goes
    for the various soundtrack, Mescaleros, and Latino Rockabilly War tracks
    included. For that matter, the unreleased Clash track ""(In The) Pouring
    Rain"", recorded live in 1984, isn't one of Strummer's best, either, but
    both it and his subsequent band work shows even average Strummer material to be of
    value. 
    </p>
<p>
    Is <em>The Future is Unwritten</em> essential
    listening? No. Is it educational? A little. Is it entertaining? Definitely. Four
    and half years after his death, the world's changed a lot, but Strummer's
    rightful place in it remains the same. ""Without people, you're
    nothing,"" declares Strummer in one final clip. ""People can change
    anything."" Well, we can't bring Strummer back. But with discs like <em>The
    Future Is Unwritten</em> we can at least pretend he's still here.

    Many listeners first became aware of Jana Hunter through her appearance on 2004's catalystic folk
    compilation <em>Golden Apples of the Sun</em>, curated by her
    friend and sometime collaborator Devendra Banhart. Not out of place for a neo-folk comp, her
    song ""Farm, CA""-- a dark country-ish tune with haunting strings and
    lackadaisical acoustic guitar-- didn't fully intimate the depth and diversity
    of Hunter's songcraft and wise-beyond-her-years croon. Then she hit us with
    the dusky, dreamy full-length <em>Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom</em>. Similar
    in feel to Banhart's early lo-fi bedroom album <em>Oh Me Oh My, </em>and to a degree, CocoRosie's early ramshackle naiveté (minus the corn and bloated
    self-importance), the dimly lit, introspective,
    and cathartic nature of that excellent debut felt almost hermitic. Appropriately, the record also <em></em>marked the launch of
    Gnomonsong, the label started by Banhart and Vetiver's Andy Cabic.</p><p>
    For her sophomore release, <em>There's No Home</em>, Hunter stands in the
    light, brings along a few friends, and seems ready to go emerge from her cave. The album opens with ""Palms"", a
    meditative invitation (""I open my hands to you/ I've showed you my palms/
    I've showed you my soft skin for what it really was"") wherein Hunter's
    breathy, long-held chorale-like voice reaches out to someone who she senses is nearby, but in fact, is ""already long gone.""</p><p>
    Hunter's tone quickly changes
    with the sassy second track ""Babies"", a tune evocative of <em>Moon
    Pix-era </em>Cat Power. One of Hunter's poppier numbers, its ""bah bah bah"" backing vocals are accompanied by bouncing drums while strings and
    guitars spiral around. It's also a great example of what makes Hunter's music so rich:
    Here, she tills a fertile bed of melancholy, only to yield colorful, joyful flowers. One
    contributing factor to the album's relative lightness-- like <em>Blank Unstaring</em>,
    it's pretty blue on the whole-- is the concise and fluid songwriting: Most of these songs are under three minutes. 
    </p>
<p>
    The emotional complexity-- or rather, saddled contradictory
    feelings-- aren't all that set her apart from her peers: She also draws on influences from outside folk which, largely due to her finger-style treatment and accompaniment choices, wind up adhering to a folk template. For example, the excellent ""Vultures"" pairs a
    rhythmic, flamenco-like guitar part with syncopated drums, evoking a dusty
    desert highway. The country- and gospel-tinged ""Bird"", and the
    experimental ""Pinnacle"", add fusion drum flourishes, angular
    electric guitar bursts, and feedback drones that wouldn't sound out of place on
    a Ghost or Six Organs of Admittance record. ""Recess"" is a somber
    ballad akin to some of the Pretenders' saltier sad songs. And
    ""Sirens"", stylistically in line with numbers like ""All the Best
    Wishes"" and ""The Earth Has No Skin"" from her debut, is a ballad
    with minor-chord arpeggios and the waltz-like time-signature used in all those 60s girl-group
    breakup songs.
    </p>
<p>
    Hunter's winding melodies possess a mysterious déjà vu quality, like lost
    tribal folk hymns, and the captivating sense of mystery inherent in her voice, which is at once both husky and wispy, is enhanced by keeping the subject matter purposefully vague. She often employs the Björk-like lyrical conceit of using ""it"" to refer to some ambiguous source of discontent or exaltation. Once again, take the poetic
    ""Vultures"" (""I can feel my thoughts a circling like vultures do/
    When it comes on/ Comes on so strong"") or the reflective
    ""Babies"": ""For many reasons I left my home/ Most of the reasons
    I still don't know."" Which leaves us to guess, finding our own empathic
    reasons.

    Sometimes I feel for Guillermo Scott Herren. His almost-namesake, Gil Scott-Heron, could get
    away with nearly anything in his prime, partly because his reputation preceded him, and partly because he had enough inborn charisma and cool to pull off virtually anything-- even to the point of making decent spoken word records. But perspective is everything, and because he's known primarily for his ""glitch-hop"" project Prefuse 73, even Herren's most esoteric works tend to be processed by most listeners as having some relationship to hip-hop. Like an episode of ""Three's Company"", hilarious
    misunderstandings ensue.</p><p>
    To be sure, Herren's new Savath &amp; Savalas album, <em>Golden Pollen</em>, would make a <em>terrible</em> hip-hop record. In fact, it might actually have been the worst Spanish-language hip-hop
    record of all time, putting it about a notch below
    Gerardo's <em>Mo' Ritmo</em>-- if it was a hip-hop record at all. Fortunately, it's not: Just as Herren's work as Prefuse 73 fits neatly amid Warp Records' boundary-pushing electronic fare, Savath &amp; Savalas plays to the Anti label's artist-as-personality aesthetic.</p><p>
<em>Golden Pollen</em> shines a
    brighter spotlight on Herren himself than it does on the equipment he uses to arrange his instruments (a variety of
    traditional Latin American stringed instruments, percussion, vibes, and
    synths) into loungey,
    modernist folk pastiches. Granted, he does pull in help from Tarantula A.D.'s
    Danny Bensi, Battles' Tyondai Braxton, Triosk drummer Laurence Pike, singer/songwriter Mia
    Doi Todd (who sings wraithlike harmonies amid the intro's cinematic string flurries),
    and Ghostface, who takes the lead vocal on slow-burning anthem ""Estrella de Dos
    Caras"". Wait, did I say Ghostface? Make that José González. 
    </p>
<p>
    But most of the album focuses on Herren himself. His voice, featured more
    prominently here than ever before, is a nice surprise-- a soft Spanish coo that integrates with floating vibes and skittering flamenco
    guitars, creating a uniformly placid yet dramatic sonic
    surface. Some of the songs are just a hair away from traditional: ""Apnea
    Obstructiva"" and ""Olhas"" betray nothing of their producer's
    usual post-modern leanings and wouldn't sound out of place on a compilation of modern
    Latin American folk. 
    </p>
<p>
    Elsewhere, Herren shows his colors, using sturdy traditional compositions as
    canvases for his deft collages. The clip-clopping percussion and flecked guitar
    of ""Paisje"" emerge from abstract atmospheric rumbles, while the
    dense, off-kilter blur of ""Concreto"" seems held together only by
    Herren's sedate croon. The dark romantic ballad ""El Solitario"" blooms
    out of a spring-wound electro meltdown, as does the cymbal-crashed tone-droner
    ""Faltamos Palabras"". These touches, combined with Herren's
    consistently lively playing, make for a seamless album that should be just
    inventive enough for his fans, yet comfortable enough to draw in listeners for
    whom the term ""Ableton plug-in"" has no significance. 
    </p>
<p>
    This seamlessness is at once an asset and a shortcoming. It can be exquisite
    in short bursts, but drags a bit over the course of this 16-track
    album, which is too homogenous in its dreamy, mid-tempo mood to justify its
    length. Despite the consistent allure of its sounds, <em>Golden Pollen </em>becomes
    tedious; by its final third, the songs sound so familiar you might keep
    checking to see if it's cycled back to the beginning. There's a very strong EP
    here, even a good short album, but you know these rap guys-- always gotta make
    an hour-long album, even when they don't have the material to flesh it out. And
    even, apparently, when they're not actually rap guys. But no one's forcing anybody to wade through the whole thing at once, and as a series of moments, <em>Golden Pollen</em> stands with 2004's more concise <em>Mañana</em> as further proof that there's more to Herren than looking for the perfect beat.

    Geek rock's always been a pseudo-genre that stinks of stylistic
    hair-splitting and a cock-rock-normative mentality. Okay, so someone like
    Rivers Cuomo indisputably qualifies as ""nerdy,"" but take a look at
    rock's ""coolest"" icons--Mick Jagger's high school report card was
    immaculate, Led Zeppelin obsessed over Tolkien, and countless guitarists from Eddie
    Van Halen to Slash spent their teenage years hunched over a fretboard
    memorizing scales and chords. In the cafeteria of rock, the line between the
    nerds' and cool kids' tables appears infinitely blurrier than real world high
    school stratification. Then again, none of these artists ever sounded as
    vulnerable as Minneapolis's Seymore Saves the World, a pop rock trio seemingly
    doomed to relive their high school tribulations for an eternity.</p><p>
    As their name suggests, the band revels in a Peter Parker-like
    transformation from zero to hero, their superpower being frontman Scott Hefte's
    brainy lyrics and turn-on-a-dime melodies. Joined by ex-Tapes 'n Tapes bassist
    Shawn Neary and drummer Shawn McGregor, the band's sound borrows a great deal
    from similarly wry piano-based 1990s pop artists such as the New Radicals or
    Fastball. However, no influence more blatantly shows through these twelve songs
    than Ben Folds. Like <em>Whatever and Ever Amen...</em>, Seymore's self-titled
    debut engages in a nostalgic, one-sided repartee, conjuring wince-worthy high
    school themes like sports (""Track Star"", ""Team Player"") and
    awkward teenage poetry (""Love Song"", ""The Night""). Although
    at times Hefte resembles the chatty ""Remember that time senior
    year..."" stereotype, he packs enough interesting melodies to accompany the
    rants. On ""Red Wing"", Hefte goes ga-ga for some girl named Mary
    Christmas, though the real story lies in the song's pulsating rhythm, which
    climaxes at a meaty fuzz-bass bridge.</p><p>
    As well executed as these songs are, the album sorely lacks any landmarks to
    latch onto. The keyboard/bass/drums texture never changes throughout the album,
    no genre outside of piano pop is ever touched. The final third of the album
    especially drags, as each song ends on a show-stopping rally cry so desperate
    to provide closure for an album's worth of salad days nostalgia. The band's ad
    hoc sound makes sense considering this is, after all, one of Hefte's side bands
    away from the buffer Minneapolis trio Superdanger. Whereas that band's vocalist
    Caleb Rick has a slacker howl to complement Hefte's nasally whine, Seymore
    doesn't enjoy such versatility, and their self-titled album sounds like a stray
    piece that'd be more engaging connected to the rest of the puzzle.

    I first saw Dan Deacon play live in August 2005, just after I moved to Baltimore. The occasion was a ""bridging-the-gap"" measure at a local loft space to foster unity between the city's art-damaged noise kids and its breakbeat-loving club kids. By the time I arrived, a balding, baby-fattened fellow with a patchy Brillo frizz of beard was unraveling a mess of electronics on a table in the middle of the dancefloor. And once all the plugs were plugged and the jacks were jacked, this man, Dan Deacon, turned himself on.</p><p>
    What came out of the PA was a barrage of cheap-sounding, rainbow-hued, breakcore-tempo electronic noise. It felt like I was hearing my entire childhood record collection of cheerful kiddie 45s sped up on a hotrodded Fisher Price record player. Deacon himself was dancing along with a joyous palsy, singing through a scrim of squeaky effects. In a night where I'd shown up wanting dance music, Deacon had completely upended my expectations. He also made me a fan for life. A small handful of the grouches stood with incredulous arms folded across their chests and everyone else proceeded to freak the fuck out, almost as wildly as Deacon himself. Welcome to Baltimore.</p><p>
    ""Wooody Wooodpecker"", the opening track from Deacon's Carpark Records debut <em>Spiderman of the Rings</em>, combines everything awesome-- and potentially alienating-- about
    Deacon's music into 3:50 and sticks it right at the beginning of the
    record. Here, he loops and distorts the famous cartoon character's convulsive laugh over a sizzling synthesizer crescendo, a needling 12-note keyboard melody, and mechanical percussion that winds to a point where a human drummer's tendons would snap. It's like Deacon's switch got stuck somewhere between ""irritate"" and ""captivate"" and he decided to never bother fixing it.</p><p>
    Despite its cacophonous electronic surface, the best of <em>Spiderman of the Rings</em> hits the pleasure centers with a string of great pop singles. ""The Crystal Cat"" could almost be a straight-up surf-rock tune until the moment when Deacon's leader-of-the-pack goon croon becomes a grotesquely twisted helium shriek and the drums explode like illegal fireworks. ""Okie Dokie"" is basically ""Wooly Bully"" rewritten with Deacon's handmade tone generators and ring modulators. 
    </p>
<p>
    See, Deacon makes ""noise rock"" that taps directly into the great lineage of batshit bubblegum pop. <em>Spideman</em> connects at various points with Kasenetz and Katz, Sam the Sham, happy hardcore and gabba techno, ""Surfin' Bird"", the twinkly melodies of an infant's mobile (the unexpectedly gorgeous ""Big Milk""), the Ramones, Koji Kondo (composer-in-residence for the Nintendo Entertainment System), Max Martin, and Daft Punk. On an earlier EP, 2006's <em>Acorn Master</em>, Deacon covered Bobby Darin's ""Splish Splash"". That spastic take on a rock'n'roll classic feels with hindsight like an obvious run up to <em>Spiderman</em>.</p><p>
    But there's at least one song on <em>Spiderman</em> that betrays his deep background in more cerebral electronic and avant-garde music. Deacon is a core member of Baltimore's Wham City crew-- a Baltimore loft/show space and arts collective-- and the 12-minute ""Wham City"" is this album's centerpiece. In this tribute to his friends and his former home, you can hear hints of all sorts of hypnotic beats, from Neu!'s motorik percussion and Kraftwerk's synthesizers to Steve Reich's mallets and Terry Riley's keyboards. But as a sing-along-- or chant-along in this case, one of the catchiest of the year-- it also hints at a deep love of old ""Sesame Street"" records and a full collection of ""Muppet Show"" DVDs. Even when Deacon goes epic-- and pays tribute to the hardcore experimental composers he studied in college-- he can't resist the urge to play up to your inner child.  </p><p>
    Like all the kid-friendly stuff that informs his sound-- pop bands, candy ravers, Carl Stalling, noise bands in stupid masks, rap music reduced to a bunch of catchy catch-phrases, and jumping on your bed with friends-- Deacon doesn't care about looking cool. (Rock magazine stylists will never get within 100 feet of the guy.) And if you're down with the cause (Wham City fliers flatly stated ""no jerks""), Deacon wants you to join him in adding silly joy to a world that's been feeling pretty drab. This fearlessness in the name of trying to make people happy spills onto <em>Spiderman of the Rings</em> like neon poster paint. The album deserves to make song-and-dance man Deacon a superstar, or at least as much of a superstar as the Dean Martin of self-soldered electronics can be.<br/>

And who could blame him? A president he didn't vote for had just won another four years-- missteps into lecturing could be forgiven. The old Francis, the quirky, quipping storyteller, triumphantly returns on <em>Human the Death Dance</em>, his second record on Epitaph, to his unique blend of diaristic, down-to-earth meditations, eerie soundscapes, and loopy abstraction.</p><p>
    Not that an herbivorous slam poet from Rhode Island, to put it frankly, would be expected to drop politics altogether. The personal is especially political on ""Underground for Dummies"", a biting, but never bitter, record of Francis's long tango with the music industry. And he's losing patience with the close-mindedness within his own art form: ""This is hip-hop for the people/ Stop callin' it emo!"" Francis sees nonsense everywhere. On ""Midgets and Giants"", he lampoons subcultural bullshit across the board, from the doe-eyed disciples of <em>8 Mile</em> (""a promotional tool, shithead/But not for you, shithead"") to the sexed-up and curiously alive Suicide Girls.</p><p>
    And the mission to broaden hip-hop's palette (and palate) presses on behind the curtain, where usual suspects-- Sixtoo, Alias, Reanimator-- switch off with other outer-rim stars. cLOUDEAD's Odd Nosdam blends ghostly atmospherics and Golden Age breakbeats on the opener, while composer Mark Isham lends a swank, silver-screen drama to ""Good Fashion"". Isham's tender union of piano, harp, and strings nearly steals the show on ""Water Line"", a spoken-word diatribe on not doing your job, and not just in New Orleans.</p><p>
    ""Got Up This Morning"" sways to Buck 65's high-tech confederacy of fiddles and harmonica, before Francis' female companion poses that timeless question: What would Bukowski do? Pendulums may swing and paradigms might shift, but you can always count on underground hip-hop for those endearingly nerdy, English-major moments. If you decode Jolie Holland's dreamy sighs on ""Black Out on White Night"", rumor has it you'll hear Dante.</p><p>
    As you circle deeper into the record, whispers of the old confessionalism get louder and louder. ""Going Back to Rehab"" weaves allusions to the greats, Nas and Biggie, into a six-minute tapestry that encompasses everything great about Sage Francis's strongest album to date: Its neon rainbow of tones and moods, the almost telepathic harmony between producer and rapper, the riveting fault-line tiptoe between memoir and manifesto.</p></div>"|10186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10186-human-the-death-dance/|7.9|Roque Strew

    The Mary Onettes, a guitars-and-keyboards band from Sweden, don't make any excuses about sounding awfully 80s, and their indie-romantic touchstones aren't so different from any other new-wavers': This debut album includes broad, obvious borrows from both New Order and the Cure, and fainter echoes of plenty of other stars from that constellation. The main difference is the side of this stuff that they're interested in borrowing. These days, lots of acts look back on New Order as the serious-minded dance-music pioneers who made ""Blue Monday""; the Mary Onettes sound more intrigued by the swoony, chart-topping pop of a song like ""Regret"". Lots of acts draw on the Cure for their spikiness, their spookiness, their goth; the Mary Onettes would rather compete with ""Just Like Heaven."" When they reach the height of unembarrassed pop on this record-- on a song called ""Under the Guillotine"", which their singer pronounces, lovably, ""gilly-o-teen""-- it's not hard to imagine them being shoved unnoticed into a glossy 80s-station lunchtime playlist, somewhere around ""I Melt With You"" and ""Take On Me"" and ""Under the Milky Way"".</p><p>
    And so here's the slick, earnest, romantic, spiffy-haired pop music that most of today's new-wavers try their best to harden up and steer clear of, generalized and blurred out to the point where it feels more like just big dreamy radio anthems than an <em>imitation </em>of anything-- we endeavor not to stereotype, but how Swedish is that?</p><p>
    Like all experiments in the field of ""perfect pop,"" it has its pros and cons. The good news is that bright, breezy, joyful retro always beats the kind of retro that pretends it's still fierce and original, and the generalist pastiche of the Mary Onettes' big singles feels generous, charming, and not at all ripped off. ""Lost"" might start out a bit New Order, but it quickly blows up into grand teen-movie hooks that only a grump could find much fault with: They actually capture that ideal mid-80s quality of sounding like they're posing happily in slow motion, one of the music video's many gifts to the vocabulary of actual music. This is their main strength, really-- on songs like ""Lost"" and ""Void"", the Golden Age they're conjuring comes back through their melodies and song structures, not just the superficial business of synth settings and production styles. (Melodies rarely feel like they're copying anyone in particular; an era, a genre, but rarely anyone in particular.) They're good enough at this that even when their retro styles are amusingly blatant-- the glacial synth-bath of ""The Laughter"" is just a recreation of Cure songs like ""The Funeral Party"", and ""Slow"" nips happily from all of New Order's shiniest hits-- it doesn't seem to matter: It's the hooks you're listening for, not the style, and these guys' hooks are practically out there wrestling with Tears for Fears.</p><p>
    The bad news is that it <em>does </em>matter, something that comes clearer when the band isn't so much reminding you of another era. You're listening for dreamy hooks, not style, sure-- but once they drop that borrowed style, it turns out they don't have a whole lot of their own. We have a word for good, earnest, romantic hook-writers lacking in style, and that word turns out to be ""corny"". Tracks like ""Pleasure Songs"" and ""Henry"" feel like their swoon potential is buried in a sea of middling pop-band moves (and tame, muted production that sands off what few rough edges liven up their stage show)-- an even bigger shame when, as on the chorus of the former, the melody really does seem worthy of some starry-eyed daydreaming. Style is a hard thing to come by, and these guys may not ever come around to much of their own. But if they can turn out a few more singles like ""Lost"" to slot onto mixes and obsess over for a few weeks, well, that'll be plenty appreciated on its own.<br/>

But it speaks volumes about their direct, affecting songcraft that principals Karen and hubby Don Peris can boast of a past collaborating with Natalie Merchant, soundtracking ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and ""Party of Five"" episodes, and writing songs for Amy Grant's Christian catalog, and yet, 18 years after their band's formation, find themselves right at home releasing a string of quality records for an indie label that counts My Morning Jacket and Mark Kozelek as alumnus.</p><p>
    Even by the Innocence Mission's modest standards, <em>We Walked in Song</em> is especially spare in presentation-- we don't hear drums till the final chorus of the fourth track-- but draw from a deep tradition of solitary music: from Appalachian folk and gospel hymns to breezy bossa nova and the third Velvet Underground album. The myriad of regional and historical influences are appropriate analogs for a record that's often consumed by thoughts of travel-- not from a romanticized, escapist point of view, but from the perspective of those left behind.</p><p>
    Beyond giving Karen's peculiar Joni/Newsom coo all the room it needs to soar and sigh, the stark arrangements-- built around Don's dew-drop guitar lines-- make the introduction of each new detail seem all the more purposeful, like the way the Hammond organ gives the third verse of ""Brotherhood of Man"" an extra nudge toward the finish line, or how the subliminal string arrangements and piano chords lurking in the shadows of ""Love That Boy"" seem to push Karen's object of affection further out of her reach. When the drums finally appear for the finale of ""Into Brooklyn, Early in the Morning"", in this album's calming context, the effect is as almost momentous as the opening kick-drum crash of ""Be My Baby"". But this careful craftsmanship would feel overly precious if these songs didn't possess a pleasing, lived-in familiarity that makes you think you've already internalized them through of a lifetime of AM oldies-radio osmosis.</p><p>
    In their less captivating moments-- which emerge in the album's third quarter-- the Innocence Mission can succumb to a certain folk-circle innocuousness (""A Wave Is Rolling""), but even these more typical turns are adorned with intriguing touches-- like the orchestro-flamenco flourishes on ""Over the Moon""-- that enhance <em>We Walked in Song</em>'s air of muted majesty.  ""You'll never lose that light,"" Karen sings on ""Song for Tom"", though it could easily be a song for them: a testament to the durable, slow-burn beauty of their work, and their softness of touch-- a light that rarely feels lite.</p></div>"|10205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10205-we-walked-in-song/|7.5|Stuart Berman

    Kali Holloway, lead singer and lyricist for the Affair, has the kind of
    voice that sounds like it emanates from her entire body. Somewhat low and
    earthy, it's reminiscent of Mary Weiss of the Shangri-Las but with a punk edge,
    and I bet she'd do a mean karaoke version of Pat Benatar's ""Love Is a
    Battlefield"". Holloway would probably sound like she was wailing even if
    she whispered into the microphone, though there's no way of know that from
    listening to <em>Yes Yes to You</em>. On the 13 songs on the band's debut
    full-length, life is apparently always intense enough to warrant a full wail.</p><p>
    Which is funny, considering how simple and innocent some of these little
    stories are. The Affair continually draw inspiration from the early 1960s, but
    not so much in sound as in subject matter. Take ""Andy"", a knockout
    girl-group rewrite that finds Holloway adding a tinge of longing to her bellow
    as she outlines a scene that sounds jacked from an early episode of ""Happy
    Days"": ""Andy, Andy, Andy, the first date was heavenly/ In the movies
    on the balcony/ When they dropped the lights"". You just know Andy has
    freckles. Holloway's post-movie designs are equally pure: ""I want to make
    out like bandits with you."" The possibility of heavy petting, apparently,
    will be taken up at a later date, maybe after the archetypal ""1-2
    (pause), 1"" drum finishes beating.</p><p>
    If the lyrics to ""Andy"" seem inspired by third-generation memories
    of the Kennedy years, the music updates the sound at least to the 70s. Neel
    Arant plays organ like she's auditioning for the Attractions while the guitars
    retain a pleasantly thick crunch, the sort of garage tone that's been such a
    constant in rock and roll it's hard to peg it to an era. Nothing else here is
    as catchy-- nothing to be ashamed of, really, few songs anywhere are-- but
    another half-dozen tracks acquit themselves nicely. Opener ""Unwanted
    Company"" has a dull, almost half-spoken melody on the verses that nicely
    deflates expectations for the massive chorus hook. ""Honey"" is another
    charming ode to the values of another era (""You want to take it slow/
    Let's go/ Take it back from 10 to zero"") and the song's bubbling organ
    base is the prefect soapbox for Holloway to stand and project from. 
    </p>
<p>
    Lyrically, at least, they border on twee, but it's interesting to hear such
    naïve sentiments coming from a singer who sounds so worldly and strong. Yes,
    the record flags in its final quarter, but that's not such a big deal. The
    Affair seem more like a few-tracks-at-a-time kind of outfit anyway, the type of
    band that'll find its way into mixes on the strength of their occasionally
    brilliant hooks and clear, consistent viewpoint.

    It's a little difficult not to hum the melody to
    ""Daydream Believer"" during the opening of ""Here Comes the
    Phantom"", the first track from the Clientele's third full-length album.
    The chords bump against those of the Monkees classic without mimicking them
    precisely; it's not <em>what</em> is played that sounds so familiar, but <em>how</em>,
    as the piano moves with a whimsical bounce that evokes someone dancing in
    a brightly-lit studio with walls the color of a television's test pattern. And
    when Alasdair MacLean begins to sing, it's like all the rain that fell during
    the first 50 or so songs the Clientele recorded has finally given way to
    sunlight: ""April in my mind, but I can't sleep/ So I took
    a walk around the trees/ And what did I see?/ Summer waits in the leaves/ As
    lovely as I've ever known."" We hear of cops picking flowers while walking
    their beats and a heart that plays like a violin. We've been introduced to a
    new Clientele world. But it's not all golden shafts of light: ""Happiness
    just comes and goes,"" MacLean sings to finish out the verse.</p><p>
    Listening to <em>God Save the Clientele </em>I keep
    thinking of how, through their first two albums, various EPs, and the godlike
    singles collection <em>Suburban Light</em>, the Clientele seemed defined by a
    certain kind of thoughtful stasis. They were the band that to casual observers
    sounded the same from track to track, employing a handful of production tricks
    and a slightly larger handful of lyrical themes to articulate a rich and
    complex world informed by magical realism, memory, and the ache of nostalgia.
    For good or ill, this uniformity seems to be slipping away. <em>God Save the
    Clientele</em> sounds like the work of the same band, but it shows them in a
    new, brighter light, broadened in both sound and outlook. In terms of sonics
    and tunes, these changes are welcome and logical, expanding upon the sound with
    which they made their name without sacrificing intimacy or risking coming across overcooked.</p><p>
    Most of these tracks were recorded by Lambchop's Mark Nevers
    at his Beech House studio in Nashville. Brian O'Shaughnessy, who worked on <em>Strange
    Geometry</em>, also recorded two numbers and mixed the lot. String
    arrangements-- and there are lots of them-- are again by Louis Philippe, the
    indie pop veteran with the golden ears. Suffice to say, <em>God Save </em>sounds
    warm, balanced, and absolutely gorgeous. Nevers' commitment to analog and his
    stated desire to recapture the depth of field of the finest recordings from the
    1970s are matched well to the Clientele's classicist aesthetic. The range of
    guitar tones, along with tasteful use of orchestrations, piano, and pedal
    steel, has led to an album that sounds absurdly expensive and lush for an indie
    release.
    </p>
<p>
    The band's easy melodicism is intact. ""Here Comes
    the Phantom"" and ""Bookshop Casanova"" are the sort of peppy,
    tuneful pop that would have sounded odd coming from the Clientele five years
    ago. The latter has been remarked upon for its Beatles-referencing lyrics
    (""You've got my name/ Pick up my number/ Come on, darling/ Let's be
    lovers"") and an overall mood that brings to mind the Fab Four (seems like
    there's probably a writer of paperbacks lurking somewhere in this particular
    shop). ""Winter on Victoria Street"" sounds like a Clientele title of
    old but it's another swinging track that, like ""Bookshop"", has lyrics
    that work the edge between longing and lust (""Watching a movie and getting
    bored/ Trying to get up with the girl next door""). ""The Queen of
    Seville"" might be the most beautiful ballad the band has recorded, with a
    Erik Satie-like piano line, acoustic guitar picking that oozes melancholy, and a
    radiant pedal steel that sounds dialed in from a rain-soaked countrypolitan
    dream. 
    </p>
<p>
    Balancing its sonic pleasures, <em>God Save </em>is more
    difficult to get a handle on lyrically. Which is ironic, considering that
    MacLean's words now seem simpler, more direct, and ultimately more grounded in
    pop tradition. On early singles like ""Reflections After Jane"",
    MacLean's viewpoint seemed utterly strange and simultaneously familiar, like he
    was pointing out things we'd all noticed but no one had bothered to articulate.
    ""On the bridge the workers pass in threes and fours and fives,"" he
    sang back then, and you could see those dudes in your mind, striding along with
    their lunch pails, and you knew it was important even if you weren't quite sure
    why. The instantly evocative couplets here are harder to find, and there are
    more references to a larger, more generalized big picture. Another of the
    album's stronger songs is titled ""From Brighton Beach to Santa Monica"",
    which is a whole lot of real estate, even if the verses are actually quite
    specific. (""Voices in the park following us down to Vincent Street/ Ghosts
    inside the yard, rattling their balls and chains."")
    </p>
<p>
    ""The Dance of the Hours"" sets prose to music,
    and the quickly whispered words are impossible to catch on record. Fortunately,
    they're included in the album's liners. The song's tale is quintessential
    Clientele, telling of a tiny knight found in a back garden by a child. It's the
    kind of story that could be covered in 10 words but MacLean takes a couple
    hundred anyway, teasing out every detail of the small figure's appearance
    (""I realize now that his delicate frame could only have been nourished by
    medieval foods: turnips, blood sausage, perhaps songbirds roasted in a thin,
    toxic sauce of mercury"") and circumstances. That feeling of a banal moment
    being imbued with so much potential significance, if only one would only take
    the time to comb through it, is what the Clientele's music captures at its very
    best. <em>God Save </em>may not get there quite as often as <em>Strange Geometry</em> or the songs collected on <em>Suburban Light</em>, but it does
    so much else right such potential shortcomings are easy to set aside.

In a way, that's kind of a shame. When I say the Vancouver-based     trio's early recordings are among the cutest things I've heard, I'm giving some     of my highest praise, but to most people, ""cute"" probably means     something less, well, substantial. Especially when applied to three young women     with only modest technical chops, the term could seem both confining and     condescending. Sure enough, Cub were moving in a noisier direction by 1997,     when they called it quits. In interviews, singer/bassist Lisa Marr would     emphasize her smoking and drinking, two very grown-up vices; at another point,     then-drummer Neko Case shocked an unruly audience member with a roundhouse     right. Twee as <i>fuck</i>, maaan.</p>
<p>Cub may have been understandably uncomfortable being     written off as cute, but their music-- mostly punky three-chord twee-pop similar     to Sacramento's Tiger Trap or a Pacific Northwest all-girl Ramones-- was often     more memorable, emotionally affecting, and flat-out <i>fun</i> than so much of     the self-serious, middlebrow cock rock that tends to top year-end lists. Their     1993 collection of EPs and new material, <i>Betti-Cola</i>, which features     future New Pornographer and solo songstress Case behind the kit on a couple of     tracks, shows Cub finding their ramshackle, sweetly innocent voice. When they     began to toy with their squeaky-clean image on 1995's <i>Come Out Come Out</i>,     a good band got even better. Both albums, recently given the deluxe-reissue     treatment on original label Mint, come as endearingly awkward reminders of a     free-spirited enthusiasm too often missing in today's crop of licensing-ready indie-pop     upstarts. At least cuteness can be controversial.</p>
<p>Featuring cover art by Archie Comics artist and <i>Josie     &amp; the Pussycats </i>creator Dan DeCarlo, <i>Betti-Cola</i> compiles Cub's     early Mint EPs, <i>Pep </i>and <i>Hot Dog Day</i>, and adds 15 newer songs--     plus, on this reissue, four previously 7-inch-only tracks and one live     ""Wipe Out"" goof. Girly and unabashedly juvenile, <i>Betti-Cola</i> lets Marr, guitarist/singer Robynn Iwata, and a rotating cast of drummers     breeze through songs about chinchillas, dolphin boys, flying carpets, and     eventual Destroyer guitarist Nicolas Bragg; like Jonathan Richman post-<i>Modern     Lovers</i>, Cub prove that childlike whimsy can be, in the words of Joe     Harvard, ""a purer form of rebellion."" As with most proudly amateurish     bands, Cub actually improved given practice, so jangly mid-album tracks like     lonesome ""Pretty Pictures"" and popsicle-packing ""A Picnic""     are among the best here, charming and melodic. ""It's true, the world is     ugly/ But everything could change,"" Marr sings on ""Someday"", a     wrenchingly optimistic love song for no one. The covers-- the Beach Boys'     ""Surfer Girl"", Beat Happening's ""Cast a Shadow"", Daniel     Johnston's ""Tell Me Now""-- are well chosen, always neatly suited for     Cub's powerfully light-hearted delivery.</p>
<p>Cub tighten up as a band still more for <i>Come Out     Come Out</i> without losing their appealing simplicity, thanks in part to     increasingly confident songwriting. Having a full-time drummer, Lisa G.,     probably also helped. The reissue tacks on an alternate version of adorable     watching-you-sleep song ""Your Bed"", a silly live version of     ""Cast My Shadow"", a sillier radio rendition of the debut's ""My     Chinchilla"", and an, uh, ambient-house mix of early song ""Go     Fish"", but the original full-length itself still stands as one of the     better twee-pop albums from an era that also brought us great material from the     Pastels, the Softies, Rocketship, Tullycraft, and others. ""New York     City"" captures the joy of being young and in love in a big city, with     fuzz-tone guitars and girl-group melodies, while organ-accented     ""Everything's Geometry"" goes for jangly guitars but fuzzy math:     ""If 1 is 3 and 3 is 9, then we can be happy all of the time."" Here,     pumpkins turn into princesses, and a ""flaming red bobsled"" can be a     thing of menace. A closing Go-Go's cover, ""Vacation"", is as     deceptively exuberant as you'd expect.</p>
<p>The album takes a darker turn on songs like     bloodstained ""Life of Crime"", but it never loses its spirit of fun.     Where <i>Betti-Cola</i> seems assured of the modern ideal of romantic love, <i>Come     Out Come Out </i>interjects playfully self-aware anxiety next to the giddiness     of tra-la-la love songs like ""I'm Your Angel"". On ""Tomorrow Go     Away"", Marr sings (with some irony): ""We never talk of love/ 'Cause     I'm much too cool for that now/ And you fuck me on the floor/ 'Cause there's no     room for a bed... We eat lunch with your parents while you're wishing I was     dead."" It's been said that you can reason someone into believing in God,     but you can't reason them out of it, and I wonder if it's the same way with     true love: Once you've taken that leap of faith, does everything change? Bad as     they may have wanted to be, Cub landed squarely on the side of the angels. And     that's totally punk rock.</p></div>"|11902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11902-betti-cola-come-out-come-out/|8.0|Marc Hogan

    At their worst, mash-ups can come across as patronizing in-jokes,
    elbowing your sternum at how totally way-out crazy it is that two
    pieces of music from disparate genres can actually coexist in the same
    space. The lazier bootleg artists stick to a predictable formula: Look
    for the most incongruous styles you can beatmatch, give the resulting
    track a cringeworthy portmanteau of a title (""Smells Like [insert
    Britney Spears reference here]""), and jam that culture for all it's
    worth. Maybe that's why mash-ups fell out of favor after their <em>Boom Selection</em>-fueled circa-2002 heyday: The idea worked a lot better when it wasn't the three-minute, 192 kbps version of a rimshot.</p><p>

    crunk and comparatively obscure electro-house theoretically smacks of
    hipster goonery. (If the name ""Tha Pumpsta"" hasn't yet dislodged itself
    from your memory banks and forced some bile into your throat, I'll give
    you a minute.) The (stereo)typical audience for this type of thing
    tends to skew towards the superficially trendy, and the first minutes
    of the mix-- Lil Jon yelling over gleeful, chirpy Euro-scuzz electro--
    might elicit either baffled amusement or embarrassed revulsion,
    depending on how tired you are of club kids screwing around with crunk.</p><p>
    But if A-Trak is prone to a certain level of aesthetic smartassery,
    he's no charlatan. In the decade since he won the 1997 DMC World DJ
    Championship at a prodigious 15 years of age, he's turned the art of
    turntablism back toward its original party-rocking focus-- the dude can
    scratch and beat-juggle, but he's just as skilled at maintaining
    momentum and crafting seamless segues. And while listeners might look
    at <em>Dirty South Dance</em>
    on paper and formulate some sort of genre hierarchy-driven classism in
    its blueprint, the mix works simply because it largely pretends that
    line doesn't exist. (And considering how Tag Team's ""Whoomp! (There It
    Is)"" turned Kano's 1980 Italo-disco track ""I'm Ready"" into one of the
    first nationally massive Southern bounce hits, it's not that much of a
    stretch.)</p><p>
    Most of the blends are effective to the point of essentially
    supplanting the original tenor of the instrumental portions, and while
    A-Trak tends to tweak the rap a cappellas in order to better fit the
    rhythms, the best ones still feel like dance on the Dirty South's
    terms. The cartoon ghettotech Peanut Butter Wolf mix of Baron Zen's
    ""Turn Around""-- one of the more stilted moments on  Stones Throw's <em>Chrome Children</em> comp-- sounds
    a lot more natural with Da Backwudz' unruly ""I Don't Like the Look of It
    (Oompa)"" laid over it. And Rick Ross' ""Hustlin'"" is fused to Simian
    Mobile Disco's ""Hustler""-- a matchup obvious enough that Cadence Weapon
    attempted it sometime last year, though A-Trak's take (titled, yeah,
    ""Hustlin' Hustler"") does more to trim the empty spaces from Ross' vocal
    and heightens the velocity of the SMD original. The result is that each
    beat of its amped-up electro rhythm turns into a foil for Ross'
    deceptively-calm voice to ricochet off.
    </p>
<p>
    But while most of the cuts tend to lean a bit more heavily towards the rhythms of the indie-dance set and modify the vocals accordingly, they hardly detract from the MCs' original qualities. Yung Joc's ""It's Goin' Down""'s is stretched out over the throbbing raver punk of Soulwax ""E-Talking (Nite Version)"", his cadence drawn out to a relaxed drawl that makes his declaration ""err'body loves me/ I'm so <em>fly</em>"" sound twice as smooth as the original. Rich Boy's ""Throw Some D's"" is turned into a  halting but forceful hip-house vocal to match Para One's remix of Daft Punk's ""Prime Time of Your Life"". And Clipse's ""Wamp Wamp"" is scattered frenetically across Alex Gopher's retro-electro ""Motorcycle"", their tempo (and the Neptunes' lingering steel drum hook) ratcheted up to Bambaataa velocity. (One aside: A-Trak, who got his first turntable as a bar mitzvah gift, noticeably omits Malice's ""It cools to a tight wad/ The Pyrex is Jewish"" verse.)</p><p>
<em>Dirty South Dance</em> isn't an entirely accurate title, though, and there's a decent-sized glut of international debris that breaks the theme. And aside from the Pack's Bay Area anthem ""At the Club""-- with its glassy-eyed ""in the club, I shake my ass/ At the party, I shake my ass"" chorus sounding enough like a stereotypical deadpan electroclash chanteuse to feel right at home alongside Cassius' ""Feeling for You""-- most of them push the mix out of focus. Gwen Stefani's dippy ""disco Tetris"" dud ""Yummy"" clashes against the disco Katamari Damacy of LCD Soundsystem's ""Time to Get Away"", French rappers TTC sneeringly sing-song their way through ""Quitte La Piste"" (which, to its benefit, features a synth hook that sounds like a Ducati exhaust hooked up to a pipe organ), and the mandated-by-law appearance from M.I.A. has her muttering ""XR2"" over a Giorgio Moroder track-- which sounds all right, but why should she be the one get all the <em>Scarface </em>quotes?</p><p>
    As if there was still any question that this techno shit belongs anywhere near hip-hop, A-Trak ends his mix with a good Q.E.D.-- naturally, it's Timbaland's beat for ""My Love"", which he lets fly at its own familiar pace for a moment before frantically juggling it and eventually cranking it up as fast as it'll go, transforming it into a dizzying explosion of breakbeat hardcore that sounds like the Prodigy circa 91. It's one of the most berserk codas you'll ever hear in a dance mix, but A-Trak knows well enough to bring that beat back down to its original pitch before switching the lights off. He may have just spent the last 50 minutes pairing off some unlikely artists, but he's too busy moving the crowd to smirk at the results.

    Paul Duncan is the ghost in his own songs. His low, wounded voice barely registers the swells and fades of the music or the unsettled worry of his lyrics, simply drifting away as his songs veer off in unexpected directions. Like Will Oldham, he undersings to remarkable effect, yet never sounds detached or uncommitted. Instead he simply mingles with the instruments, often allowing the music to eclipse his own performance. That in itself is no mean feat: Duncan's previous albums, 2003's <em>To an Ambient Hollywood</em> and 2005's <em>Be Careful What You Call Home</em>, were subdued and quiet to the point of being minimalist. However, the austere surface could barely conceal the painstakingly textured blend of organic elements (acoustic guitars, reticent rhythm section) with synthetic (spacey squiggles, canned beats), creating a space where Duncan's voice was merely one sound among many.</p><p>
    With<em> Above the Trees</em>, his third album, Duncan at last features more prominently in the production, seemingly overtaking his accompaniment or at least drawing even with it. Again, this is no meager accomplishment, as the album sounds louder and fuller, boasting a full-band sound and a collaborative dynamic, as if Duncan and his backing musicians worked the songs out on stages across America, fine-tuning each verse and crescendo in front of responsive audiences. Strings mimic his vocal line on opener ""Red Eagle"", subtly reinforcing the chorus melody and focusing the spotlight directly on the guy whose name is on the album cover. ""The Fire"" and ""The Lake Pt. 2"" lope along at a deceptively gentle midtempo, while ""High in the Morning"" and ""Country Witch"" achieve an electric country-rock momentum similar to Magnolia Electric Co. Only ""Parasail"" falls flat: the rhythmically churning guitars sound brutish and obvious in this context, although perhaps the song translates better live.</p><p>
    Duncan doesn't jettison all of the loops and beats of <em>Be Careful</em>, but submerges them in the mix, where they can compliment, rather than compete with his band [who are credited with playing computer, modular synth, (d)rumble, shirts, and piano innards]. The approach creates a sense of depth in the production and a parallax relationship between the instruments, as if their roles and relationships are constantly changing. As <em>Above the Trees</em> progresses, Duncan and his band indulge these spacier elements, occasionally to the detriment of the song (as on the noisy ending of ""Parasail"") but mostly to the benefit of the album's tone. As always, atmosphere remains crucial, but the difference is that the guitars, horns, strings, drums, and especially Ken Champion's otherworldly pedal steel create the nighttime ambience rather than CGI. In doing so, they not only push Duncan to the forefront, but tether him to the earth.

    Music fans know the phrase ""indefinite hiatus"" as one filled
    with foreboding-- it's so often meant as a substitute for ""done for"" that's
    practically viewed as a euphemism. When Mother Hips began their indefinite
    break after crowning their career with 2001's excellent <em>The Green Hills of Earth</em> LP, it seemed logical that they might be
    hanging it up for good. They'd just dropped their best record, and the idea of
    going out on top has at least some appeal to most people. Well, it turns out
    they weren't done after all, and on the evidence of <em>Kiss the Crystal
    Flake</em>, it's a welcome return.</p><p>
    This, their sixth LP, follows on the heels of last year's
    promising <em>Red Tandy</em> EP and doesn't
    skip a beat getting back to the band's rootsy mix of 70s rock and power pop.
    Songwriters Tim Bluhm and Greg Loiacono split the duties slightly in favor of
    Bluhm, which means the album as a whole is tilted just a bit more toward the
    power pop side. The sound is about as bread-and-butter rock'n'roll as you can
    get, mostly limited to the four band members with the occasional keyboard
    embellishment or trumpet.</p><p>
    Both songwriters sound recharged, and the band, with new
    bass player Paul Hoaglin, seems glad to be back at it, taking time to jam a bit
    and let the guitars loose on a few songs, but always bringing it back to tight,
    melodic songcraft before things get out of hand. If anything, it reminds me of the direction Sloan has gone-- using their
    muscle to reinforce their popcraft and not as an end in itself. Loiacono's
    slowly churning, Tom Petty-influenced ""Confirmation of Love"" is a good example,
    using the hard downward strumming of the chorus as a mere table-setting for the
    really big hook, one powerfully delivered ""she went down to California,"" that
    plays off all the charged meaning the name of that state has acquired in the
    American subconscious. 
    </p>
<p>
    Bluhm chips in a couple of quality slow songs himself. ""Let
    Somebody"" makes great use of the blend of Bluhm's smooth voice and Loiacono's
    rougher tone on the chorus harmonies, while ""Not So Independent"" fakes you out
    with a stomping guitar intro before settling back into a recollection of a
    fireworks display at a beach party. On the higher tempo tip, ""Time We Had"" is
    one of the best pop songs in the band's catalog, with great doubled vocals from
    Bluhm and a brief guitar solo that sneaks in a new hook at the end.
    Loiacono's ""No-Name Darrell"" is stuffed with Beatles chord progressions and
    accomplished falsetto vocals, but shies away from a typical song structure,
    instead moving through multiple ideas as they arise.
    </p>
<p>
    I can't imagine anyone who followed Mother Hips in their
    initial run being unhappy with this, and people who came on board at the end
    for <em>Green Hills</em> will find the same
    forces that made that record so broadly appealing at work here. <em>Kiss the Crystal Flake</em> is the sound of a
    refreshed band making as solid an album as they ever have.

    Elliott Smith's legacy is best spoken by his records.  For all the emphasis placed on his unhappy backstory and the distressing nature of his death, Smith left behind a body of work that defies and exceeds any stereotyping. Sadness may be the easiest emotional current to pick up on in his songs, but Smith's expressive range was as wide as it was subtle; his music could be angry, funny, hopeful, and despondent, often at the same time. <em>New Moon</em> collects two CDs' worth of material recorded around the same time as 1995's <em>Elliott Smith</em> and its 1997 follow-up <em>Either/Or</em>, and unlike typical posthumous releases (not to mention <em>second</em> ones), is a genuinely worthy addition to a stunningly consistent catalog.</p><p>
    Part of what makes both <em>Either/Or</em> and 1998's <em>XO</em> so essential is Smith's avoidance of ""classic album"" compartmentalization; you don 't get ""the sad song,"" followed by ""the experimental song,"" followed by ""the upbeat song."" Smith didn't record specifically towards any album, he just recorded-- more or less constantly. At their inception, the songs compiled for <em>New Moon</em> were no less significant than those that wound up making the cut for <em>Elliott Smith</em> and <em>Either/Or</em>, and for the most part they're no less developed.</p><p>
    Smith's signature style is more musical than it is aesthetic; from the lo-fi folk of <em>Roman Candle</em> through the muscular chamber-pop of <em>Figure 8</em>, Smith's songwriting tics remain completely recognizable.  <em>New Moon</em> is overflowing with characteristic melodic turns and unexpected chord changes, yet still covers a good deal of ground stylistically.  The chugging acoustic guitar of ""Big Decision"" conjures Johnny Cash, while ""New Monkey"" subtly nods to a similarly titled Beatles song.  Each song seems fully realized in its own right; for a 2xCD posthumous compilation, it's unbelievably refreshing to not pick up even the slightest whiff of exploitative barrel-scraping.
    </p>
<p>
    Like much of Smith's material from this era, <em>New Moon</em> is by and large quiet, acoustic, and emotionally complicated.  It's easy to see why Smith's music earned him a reputation as a ""sad sack,"" but such dismissals don't really hold up to any scrutiny. When asked whether he considered himself a ""lo-fi"" artist, Smith once responded that he simply didn't want the recording process to be ""a drag.""  Smith's interest in the the expressive potential of recording comes through loud and clear on <em>New Moon</em>; even when the subject or tone of a song is depressing, it still carries an unmistakable note of joy.
    </p>
<p>
    Which is certainly not to say that <em>New Moon</em> finds him sounding ""happy.""  Many of the songs here are almost unbearably melancholy, but their weight is the product of expert craft, not wanton self-indulgence.  The coda of ""Talking to Mary"", in which Smith repeatedly intones ""One day she'll go/ I told you so,"" would not be nearly as powerful without the subtle tension and movement in Smith's guitar part.  ""All Cleaned Out"", which hints at the musical and lyrical concerns that Smith took up with <em>XO</em>, is made all the more affecting by a second vocal line that injects well-placed harmonies into an already memorable melody.  Every musical decision on <em>New Moon</em> feels both intuitive and considered; never obtrusive or distracting, but thoroughly rewarding when examined in depth.
    </p>
<p>
    Nowhere is this clearer than on an early version of the career-making ""Miss Misery"".  This is the fourth, and earliest, version of this song that I've heard, and it speaks to the incredible care and refinement that went into Smith's recordings.  The melodic backbone of the song is definitely present on this version, as are formative fragments of the lyrics, harmonies, and arrangements.  It's fascinating to hear this track in such an early stage, but downright humbling to connect the dots to the song it eventually became.  Smith had an uncanny and arguably unmatched talent for developing his music to suit his ever-evolving arrangement and production techniques, and every intermediate version of ""Miss Misery"" makes perfect sense the way it's performed and recorded.
    </p>
<p>
    Phrases like ""rare talent"" are thrown around all the time these days, but this compilation makes painfully clear just how unique and valuable this music is.  Smith's visionary qualities were not terribly flashy or transgressive, and his great musical gifts were not those of innovation.  Instead, he steadily and quietly wrote, honed, and recorded a body of beautifully executed, deeply moving records not quite like any others.  Consider him the patron saint of hobbyists, a talented and dedicated craftsman with a tireless love of the creative process.

    The word ""crooked"" pops up frequently in the lyrics to Page
    France's new record, and its two definition<em>s</em> apply to<em> </em>both sides of the band's one-of-a-kind theatricality.  ""Crooked"" can refer to either dishonesty or a physical irregularity, and on <em>Page France and the Family Telephone</em>, the group's third and weirdest album to date, singer and lyricist Michael Nau navigates both iterations; the lopsided celebration of ""Mr. Violin
    and Dancing Bear"" (""You get what you get/ When you bite from the tree/ A crookeder you, and a crookeder me"") coming after the trickster vibe of
    album-opener ""The Ruby-Ring Man"", in which he confesses: ""I lie so
    well, I even start to buy it, too.""</p><p>
    Over the course of Page France's three full-lengths, Nau has gradually removed himself
    as the lyrical focus. The boyish sensitivity of <em>Come, I'm a Lion </em>gave way to
    <em>Hello, Dear Wind</em>'s conceptual folk, and on <em>Telephone</em>'s ""Circus Head (Nobody Knows)"" he admits to creating an album-long disguise for himself as a
    Barnum character-- a huckster, unsuccessful joke-teller, and magician
    with a playfully devious streak. And in the long tradition of sad
    clowns, Nau is nothing if not painfully self-aware.  In a voice
    reminiscent of Sonny Bono's pinched paisley caterwaul, he laments on ""A
    Belly to the Sea"": ""So I fear it's all a joke, that I just wasn't
    supposed to make/ Apples in a cloud of smoke/ So fake, I'm so fake."" Then, on ""The Joker's Joke"": ""I am a stagefright comedian, that nobody
    wants to go see again/ My jokes are so long out of season, but they're
    laughing at me.""</p><p>
    Of course, like the fairy tales, Bible stories, and lullabies to which <em>Telephone</em> is clearly indebted,
    external sinister forces lurk just beyond the flower patches.  Page France keep them at bay, partly with a miniature army of
    sunny guitars, glockenspiels, and the merry harmonies of Whitney
    McGraw, but also by motivating the more potent force of simple, blissful
    naivete.  ""Beware the bug-infested apples,"" Nau warns on ""Rooster
    and Its Crow"", before scampering up the tree and picking a basket full
    of them for his sweetheart.  This instance of winsome romance
    streaks through <em>Telephone,</em> best expressed at the close of
    ""Wet Dog Afternoon"": ""I still love you dear, perhaps it gets the best
    of me sometimes.""
    </p>
<p>
    As happens with all Page France records, <em>Telephone</em>'s overt Christian symbolism will no doubt result in many scrambles to alternately celebrate or
    bemoan the Almighty's infiltration of indie pop.   But those searching for evangelical underpinnings of Page France songs are barking up
    the wrong apple tree.  Nau's interest is much more arty than devotional, merging surrealist lyrics (the sun as
    a giant ""eye,"" for example) with Biblical imagery (""I led a king through flaming
    doors"") as a formal experiment,
    relying on both aesthetic traditions to help him express the dark
    underpinnings of even the most sunny scenarios.
    </p>
<p>
    This braiding of the
    unconscious with the Unknown, as crookedly rendered as it might be, is <em>Telephone</em>'s
    greatest charm-- an inventive intertwining that gives the record a woozy, playful charisma.   Like Danielson's Daniel Smith, Nau creates a loopy musical world concerned with the extratextual elements of organized religion, with any converts he attracts along the way merely interested in playing along.  Like religion, music only exists inasmuch as it is performed, and on <em>Telephone</em>'s closer ""Casting Day"", Nau seeks to recruit a new crop of participants for his next show, asking: ""Who do you wanna be? In that crooked afterlife, at the bottom of the sea?""

Her bag of tricks isn't exactly bulging-- she usually uses multi-tracked vocals wrapped in organ drones, acoustic guitar, and a light dusting of percussion. Yet the tone-hymns she spins from those basic elements are unmistakably her own. Burke expanded this alchemy to perfection on 2005's <em>Lepidoptera</em>, using atmospherics to weave songs and melodies to create environments.</p><p>
    On <em>Alone in the Dark Wood</em>, the fifth Fursaxa full-length, those atmospheres and environments dominate. There is less to latch onto in the way of structure or melody; where on <em>Lepidoptera</em> Burke developed ideas over long arcs, here she opts for smaller sketches (almost half of the tracks hover in the two-minute range)-- more like haiku than short stories. Yet her curling plumes still entrance, the musical equivalent of a hypnotist's watch swinging before your eyes.</p><p>
    True to its title, this album has the aura of a late-night hike in which ghosts seem to waft up from the misty ground. On ""Lunaria Enters the Blue Lodge"", a creaky organ melts into acoustic guitar strummed in cresting waves. ""Bells of Capistrano"" mixes monasterial chimes with flutes chirping like insects and birds, while the shimmering, Steve Reich-like ""Clé Elum"" resembles a sonic smoke signal coming from a far-off gamelan orchestra.</p><p>
    The best pieces on <em>Alone</em> don't evoke environments as much as they create sonic universes.  On ""Sheds Her Skin"", Burke sounds like the ghost of Tiny Tim, offering delicate ukulele-like strums and warbling vocals akin to Yoko Ono's experiments.  The a cappella ""Nawne Ye"" spawns a choir from Burke's chants, and ""Alone in the Dark Wood"" bewitches with detuned guitar and distant moans. Most mesmerizing is ""In the Hollow Mink Shoal"".  Here, Burke's tentative vocals match the endearing hesitance of Vashti Bunyan, and lead deftly into a mind-locked acoustic séance.</p><p>
    That's all a lot to chew on, but the most impressive aspect of <em>Alone in the Dark Wood</em> is how Burke's layered vocals never grow stale. In so many songs, cycles of wordless purr recur nearly to the point of rote repetition. But like an endless chant that clears a meditator's mind, Burke's singing is more a portal than a pat device. And at its best, Fursaxa's music is a Zen koan, as mysteriously unsolvable as it is beautifully simple.<br/></p></div>"|10182.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10182-alone-in-the-dark-wood/|7.7|Marc Masters

    One thing that separates humans from other animals is the ability to imagine
    a world without oneself in it. This extends to the world after your death,
    places you're unlikely ever to visit, fantasy worlds that don't actually exist,
    and of course the world as it existed before you were born. As such, we have a
    strange ability to be nostalgic for things we never actually experienced, which
    keeps young bands coming back to music that bloomed and faded long before they
    could walk, much less be cognizant of cultural currents.</p><p>
    The members of French quartet Plastiscines weren't around for the first wave
    of punk-- they were barely in primary school when Nirvana broke-- but that
    doesn't stop them from having a genuine affinity with the sounds of the UK and
    Manhattan undergrounds from ten years before their time. The ""Hey, I can
    do this too"" spirit of early punk is what shines through most brightly
    here, though the notion is filtered through the Libertines, the Strokes and
    riot grrrl. There's very little information on this band in English, but the
    hilariously/horrendously translated interviews I've read all seem to detour
    into observations of how unusual it is for four 19-year-old French women to
    start a punk band and release an album, along with discussions of the attendant
    resentment they've incurred in their homeland.</p><p>
    The band's approach is basic, a few chords chugging along on distorted
    guitars, drums and bass thudding away, but lead vocalist Katty has a low,
    brassy voice, backed by exuberant group singing from her bandmates that puts
    them closer to the Clash's pop classicist end of the punk spectrum. The album
    is split between French and English songs. Though the English can be charmingly
    awkward, with strangely accented words and syllables, I generally prefer them
    in French, where their confidence really comes through. 
    </p>
<p>
    One exception there is ""Human Rights"", one of a couple songs that
    finds the band reaching into the political realm with a plea for consideration
    over a rugged punk tune that takes a few cues from the Adverts. Lead single
    ""Loser"" is sung entirely in French apart from the title, which works
    well with the great chorus melody. This song best showcases the group's pop
    chops, and ultimately, I think they have more potential moving in that
    direction than they do getting more agitated. 
    </p>
<p>
    Further evidence is on display in ""(Zazie fait de la) Bicyclette"",
    which nips at the group vocals with new wave organ and accentuates the
    bounciness of the rhythm with bubbling glockenspiel. It's something of a nod to
    the groovy pop of 1960s France, where eccentricity and humor rode shotgun with
    arty seriousness. Likewise, ""Pop in, Pop Out!"" is a hugely enjoyable
    nod to the excitable ye-ye pop of a long-gone era-- that could totally be
    Brigitte Bardot squeaking out the title between instrumental spasms.

    Producer Maxime Schmitt, a longtime Kraftwerk associate and EMI record
    executive, keeps things stripped and focused on the girls, but more
    importantly, he hasn't pressed them to expand the songs beyond their natural
    lengths. More than half the album's thirteen songs clock in under two minutes,
    and the whole thing whips by in less than a half hour, which is perfect for
    this kind of thing. The Plastiscines offer basically what you hope for from
    musicians their age: huge potential for the future and a lot of fun right now.

    What an opportune time for a Fucking Champs release.
    Seems every Joe Indie's been losing their shit over some record with guitars
    that sound like they're playing violin parts, employing homophony, polyphony,
    counterpoint, and all those other concepts taught in any high school's
    state-mandated music appreciation class. Artists ranging from Mastodon to
    Ratatat to Marnie Stern have whetted the indie audience's appetite for tight-yet-intricate axe compositions, and the veteran Champs, composed of two
    indie-metal lifers and ex-Nation of Ulysses guitarist Tim Green, make a case
    for the old guard on <em>VI</em>.</p><p>
    In the past, this portion of a Fucking Champs review
    would be reserved for prog-rock apologies/pleas aimed at indie fans repulsed
    by shifting time signatures, modes, and advanced guitar playing techniques.
    However, with the number of ambitious, technically adroit albums released and
    praised today (c.f. <em>Ys</em>, <em>Welcome to the
    Black Parade</em>, <em>Friend and Foe</em>, etc.), you'd possess a lot of gall to
    dismiss the Champs as pretentious or esoteric. <em>VI</em> strips down the prog
    to an ingestible 2-guitar/drums setup, forgoing many of the spacey,
    Yes-influenced synths and flare of previous releases and instead narrowing its
    focus on more immediate hooks and transitions.</p><p>
    ""The Loge"" kicks the album off on an
    accessible note, stomping through a series of melodic patterns not inherent to
    metal guitar but pretty ass-kicking all the same. Whereas a lot of math rock
    tries to obscure its nerdiness with stygian minor modes and excess distortion,
    this opener contains equal parts pomp and fist-pump, even during its palm-muted
    grinder of a bridge. The wistful ""Spring Break"" boasts its share of
    metal emasculating as well, bookending its middle rawk-out section with an airy
    guitar opening and carefree closing solo. The brief transitional tracks
    particularly flash a lot of nuanced ideas, such as the stately ""Abide With
    Me"" or ""Champs Fanfare"", both potential national anthems for
    countries that don't yet exist, or the eerily calm ""Insomnia"", one of
    the few instances of synths on the album.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, the threat of novelty still haunts the
    Fucking Champs, and with the recent explosion of Nintendo-core bands, that
    threat feels more real than ever. The intro of ""Fozzy Goes to Africa""
    sounds like the soundtrack for a pixelated, 8-bit kid embarking on his first
    RPG journey, while the remainder of the song stagnates on a seemingly
    never-ending meat-and-potatoes AOR riff. This prosaic plug-and-chug songwriting
    pops up in several other tracks, hardly tempered by the baroque King Crimson
    knockoff ""Dolores Park"" or the band's best stab at Xanaxed Madchester,
    ""That Crystal Behind You? (Are You Channeling)"". Still, <em>VI</em> serves as a fun changeup
    both to today's more doomsday prog-metal and hipster-approved electroclash
    fugues. The album, while technically proficient, packs enough surprises and raw
    energy to avoid rote Yngwie Malmsteen-esque ""songwriting"" tropes.
    Don't be surprised if this heady offering leaves you less eager to fire up your
    lighter and crowd surf as it does to fire up your TI-83 and take the math
    portion of the SATs.

    If you wanted to find the last time Björk really let her hair down on a record, you'd have to look all the way back to 1995's <em>Post</em>. From ""Army of Me"" (its video found her driving a tank and wearing gold
    teeth) to ""It's Oh So Quiet"" to ""I Miss You"", that record sired some of the
    most vibrant songs of her career. It's a side of her we've only caught in brief
    glimpses ever since. <span> </span>In the course of moving
    back to Iceland after a letter bomb scare in 1997, engaging in psychological warfare with Lars Von Trier on the set of 2000's oppressively bleak
    <em>Dancer in the Dark</em>, falling in love
    with Matthew Barney in 2001, giving birth to her second child in 2002, and of
    course, just getting older, Björk's output has become increasingly austere and inward-looking.
    The unhinged, mischievous screamers that were once her calling card are now mostly
    a thing of the past, replaced by songs that more closely resemble holy moments
    than sing-alongs.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But in her pre-game interviews for <em>Volta</em>, Björk hinted that it might finally be time to flip the
    switch back. ""All I wanted for this album was to have fun and do something that
    was full-bodied and really up,"" <u><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/42181-interview-bjrk"">she told Pitchfork</a></u>-- one of a handful of interviews to feature descriptors like ""fun""
    and ""poppy"" and ""accessible."" Disappointingly, it turns out that Timbaland and
    the Technicolor artwork were red herrings-- <em>Volta</em> is not Björk's pop record. Figuring out <em>what</em> it is, actually, is a much more difficult task; where even her
    most divisive albums have managed to push her artistic boundaries, <em>Volta</em> feels limp
    and strangely empty-- almost unfinished.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Its emptiness is doubly disappointing when considering the
    caliber of guest performers involved. In addition to Timbaland, <em>Volta</em> features Antony Hegarty (of &amp; the Johnsons fame), improv drummer Chris Corsano, Lightning Bolt drummer Brian Chippendale,
    Konono No. 1, Malian kora player Toumani Diabate,  Chinese pipa player
    Min Xiao-Fen, and a 10-piece Icelandic brass band. Some of that guestlist goes wasted;
    Chippendale is banished to slow-build purgatory on the brooding Antony duet ""The Dull
    Flame of Desire"", while Konono No. 1 are reduced to fighting for space with 37
    other elements in the already overstuffed ""Earth Intruders"". Even Timbaland's
    contributions feel oddly apathetic; aside from ""Earth Intruders"", which pales
    in comparison to any Timbaland/Björk collaboration you'd hear in your head, neither of his other productions bear much of his imprint at all. With its distorted, squelching rhythms,
    ""Innocence"" sounds, ironically, more like the work of longtime collaborator Mark
    Bell, and ""Hope""s scampering percussion and spindly kora lines, while interesting,
    are marred by an atrocious lyric about terrorism: ""What's the
    lesser of two evils?/ If a suicide bomber made to look pregnant/ Manages to
    kill her target or not?""
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    For a record ostensibly about tribalism and reconnecting
    with our animal sides, much of <em>Volta</em>
    plods. Insulated with samples of running water,
    long, mournful horns, and gently plucked pipa, ""I See Who You Are"" is a tranquil
    lullaby without much of a melody at all. ""Vertebrae by Vertebrae"" rests on a
    looped horn sample not far from Peter Thomas' ""Bolero on the
    Moon Rocks"" (sampled by Pulp on ""This Is Hardcore""), but <span> </span>Björk can't take it
    anywhere, instead filling its five minutes with runs from her catalog
    of preferred vocal shorthand scribbles. On the heels of those two songs, the
    rhythmless ""Pneumonia""-- which finds Björk utterly adrift melodically-- is an even harder sell.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    There are, of course, a handful of lovely parts as well. While I have problems with the
    way ""Earth Intruders"" <em>sounds--</em> muddy, clunky, overcompressed, and not nearly
    as aerodynamic as you'd expect a Björk/Timbaland track to sound-- its charm comes
    through with time. With lyrics pulled from a Russian poem made popular by
    Andrei Tarkovsky's <em>Stalker</em> (how's <em>that</em> for pop!) and regal, curling horns reminiscent
    of the crescendoing strings in Henryk Gorecki's 3rd Symphony (uh,
    ditto), the 7½-minute Björk/Antony duet ""The Dull Flame of
    Desire"" is a darkly elegant setpiece that beautifully showcases both voices. Ultimately,
    though, it's the industrial jackhammering of ""Declare Independence"" that
    steals the show. Built around a wriggling synth lead, some brash EQing,
    and white-hot swaths of digital noise, it's a gloriously messy few minutes-- one of her most transcendent tracks to date.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    In the end, though, those golden moments are too few and far
    between, and the slow, unfurling, lingering moments too long. If the critical
    and fan response to this album reflects that of the fascinatingly eccentric (but largely maligned) <em>Medúlla</em>, I'll be curious
    to see how she responds. Until then, <em>Volta</em>
    is mostly proof that Björk is as fallible as the messy, unpredictable humanity
    she celebrates, and that even her definition of ""pop"" is avant-garde.

    I've never seen the Sea and Cake play, but I wouldn't
    be surprised if they did so with their backs to the crowd. Their albums have
    never been unapproachable-- most of the time, in fact, they're pretty and
    inviting. They have great ears for rhythm, borrowing from bossa nova and
    Afro-pop, and they've a charming vocalist in Sam Prekop. And yet they can come
    off as stuffy and cerebral-- the kind of band categorized as ""pop"" by default,
    the way you'd use the word to describe Stereolab or their neighbors and contemporaries
    Tortoise. These qualities became even more prominent with the keyboards and
    electronic dalliances on albums beginning in 1997 with <em>The
    Fawn</em> up through 2003's <em>One Bedroom</em>. So I picture them on stage
    interpreting some fluttering theme over bongos and layers of analog keyboards,
    their brows furrowed over nailing a sound rather than playing a song.</p><p>
    Whether ethnic or electronic, whatever the Sea and Cake
    runs through their eccentric filter winds up sounding slightly
    ""off,"" either from the space and ambiguity in their
    compositions or the hoarse peculiarity of Prekop's voice. Yet even a more
    direct, backyard-barbecue-ready album
    album like <em>Everybody</em> still works. In
    fact, it may fit the band's idiosyncrasies even better. In moving a little
    closer to the middle-of-the-road, they start exuding something long absent from
    the group: warmth. The band that once cultivated abstraction and aloofness now,
    as elder statesmen of Chicago post-rock, stuffs its liners with pictures of
    their hometown next to guitar tablatures spelling out the chords for their
    songs. The Sea and Cake want to be your friends, all of a sudden. To make
    another one of those inevitable Chicago comparisons: in a catalog full of stiff
    frosts, this record is the thaw. Its spring release couldn't be more perfectly
    timed.</p><p>
    ""Up on Crutches"" quickly sets the tone with a
    sparkling, insistent strum, a typical rock pattern from the drums, and Prekop
    sounding breathlessly nonchalant while the rhythm builds. ""Too
    Strong"" has the typically effete melody you'd expect from the band, though
    it's far more immediate and has a stunning slow jangle of a chorus, deft and
    breathtaking in its quiet appeal. Not to make him self-conscious, but age suits
    Prekop well, as he creaks earnestly and sounds wizened and authoritative no
    matter what he's singing about. This is especially noticeable in
    ""Middlenight"", where he pines about a possible ""return to better
    days"" while pedal steel guitar warms the soles of listeners basking in its
    gorgeous mid-tempo strumming. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>Everybody</em> picks up the pace in more than one
    spot, however: ""Crossing Line"" is one of their best pop songs,
    hummable and slick with a buzzing single-note guitar tearing through Prekop's
    cheery ""doot-doo-doo""' and simple requests (""All I need's a
    little smile""). There's some syncopation in ""Exact to Me"" that
    recalls their love for the bossa nova beat, though it's far too straightforward
    and sinewy to fit in with their earlier work. Likewise with the monotone pluck
    of ""Lightning"", with a rhythm so tricky it'd sound like a CD skipping
    if not for the calming consistency of Prekop's crooning. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's a shame that adjectives like ""pleasant""
    wind up sounding backhanded or inadequate; maybe ""playful"" is a
    better word for <em>Everybody</em>. That it still sounds mischievous and human
    through the band's studious chops and omnivorous listening habits is no small
    feat, as these qualities have eluded them for quite a while. It's been four years since their
    last album, and Chicago's post-rock heyday has past, but the Sea and Cake remain relevant simply by becoming more transparent.
    They're still in the business of being a pop band, and this might be their most
    direct pop record.

One was a famous affair with slightly-off pop and the other was a secret crush on free jazz. Fans may have seen the signs in 1994's <em>Through the Hill</em>, his record with ambient composer Harold Budd. Partridge finally fully liberates his love for Pharaoh Sanders and Albert Ayler on <em>Monstrance</em>, reuniting with keyboardist Barry Andrews (who left XTC in 1979, later starting Shriekback) and recruiting Martyn Barker (drummer in Andrews' band). Together they abandon the domain of shimmery pop with a twist for a moody, dissonant netherworld.</p><p>
    It bears repeating: Don't expect to encounter XTC here. And good luck finding Shriekback. But if you take <em>Monstrance</em> on its own terms-- bringing a yen for improvisational, instrumental music-- you might feel the strange thrill of eavesdropping on a freewheeling, nonsensical conversation. Culled from roughly eight hours of recordings, we still get to hear the awkward lulls, the autistic blurts, the little foils that often enrich the surrounding noise. Lightly edited and proudly free of overdubbing, <em>Monstrance</em> allows concepts to roam, phrases to drift.</p><p>
    The record's long prelude, ""I Lovely Cosmonaut"" unfolds in slow motion, as a rhythm of silences accrues in the potholes, everyone swerving around it, stubbornly, until a fuller rhythm crystallizes. ""Winterwerk"" is not as coy. On the contrary, Barker turns it into twirling, tropical carnival. Nevertheless, the longer tracks are the richest here. Coming in at 16 minutes, ""Priapple"" is arguably the centerpiece of the album. Partridge heroically sticks to a pair of fuzzy chords, as Andrews mounts a relentless and chaotic siege, while Barker answers with erratic percussion.</p><p>
    Every song-- and not always for the better-- seems to be at war with itself. ""Chaingang"" milks a sense of unease out of two rhythms, Partridge's ragged Beefheart riffs in 7/4 and Barker in 4/4, that fleetingly lock into place. These blink-and-you'll-miss-it resolutions, each one a tiny solar eclipse, give the song its thrilling air of flux and incompleteness. During the whole drama, Andrews remains the outsider looking in. He works this same routine in the first half of ""Torturetainment"", while he drills holes-- it literally sounds like heavy machinery-- into the oddball groove Partridge and Barker crafted together.</p><p>
    Calling this ""unlistenable noise"" is baffling. This record falls closer to the viscous, chaotic beauty of <em>Swans</em> than the poisonous crunch of <em>Metal Machine Music</em>. All the stretches of darkness have real depth, while at its calmer and more intimate moments, Monstrance evokes the stoic, spacey impressionism of ECM chamber jazz.</p></div>"|10184.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10184-monstrance/|7.5|Roque Strew

In his hometown, he's something of a pop phenom, but he's totally unknown outside it. Blaqstarr (no relation to Mos Def or Talib Kweli) makes Baltimore club music, the frenetically physical hybridized form of black dance music that's thrived for nearly two decades in the 410 area code but which has only started to make inroads outside it. And even as club tracks find their way into the record crates of out-of-town hipster DJs, the music's producers have yet to taste anything resembling national fame. Blaqstarr's club-rap tracks for local MCs like Young Leek (""Jiggle It"") and D.O.G. (""Ryda Girl"") have helped his clients secure major-label contracts, and he's also produced his own apocalyptic local club anthems like ""Hands Up Thumbs Down"" and ""You Keep on Fuckin' Around"". But Blaqstarr himself has only recently signed his first national record deal, and it's with a small start-up rather than with a hegemonic major; he's now the second signee to Diplo's Mad Decent label, following the rabble-rousing baile funk trio Bonde Do Role. As Baltimore rap blogger and former Pitchfork contributor Al Shipley recently pointed out to me, there's a pretty good chance that all of Blaqstarr's Mad Decent 12""s combined won't sell as much as one of the mix CDs he sells exclusively at the local Baltimore shoestore chain Downtown Locker Room.</p><p>
    So maybe it makes sense for Blaqstarr to try out his weirdest sounds on the <em>Supastarr</em> EP, his first national release. Club is generally a fairly utilitarian form of dance music; most tracks loop a couple of identifiable drum-breaks and slather them with instant-recognition samples. Most of the track's on <em>Supastarr</em> stick with club's relentless BPM-levels, but they're emptier and spacier, leaning hard on echo-effects and awkwardly lurching beat constructions. More than most club producers, Blaqstarr layers his productions, adding and subtracting different elements throughout their running times. On a few tracks, he also sings in weightlessly airy falsetto-rasp. The title track repeats a single phrase over and over like a mantra (""I like the way you move, I love the way you are/ I love your sexy ways, girl, cause you're my superstar""), giving the song a sort of hypnotic beauty that rarely finds room to surface in a genre as dense and hectic as this one. On another song, ""Rockstarrz"", he multitracks his voice into a ghostly Boyz II Men chorus, ominously cooing over a loop of fluttering strings and muted horn-stabs. ""Tote It"" uses gunshot sound-effects as percussion. ""Check Me Out Like"" phases its ravey synth-beeps back and forth and sounds best when the drums drop out completely. ""Shake It to the Ground"" has a guest-spot from the 16-year-old female rapper Rye Rye that would sound like garden-variety kiddie-rap if not for Rye Rye's eerie deadpan delivery and for the disorienting layers of echo that Blaqstarr piles on, both of which turn it into something bizarrely ominous and otherworldly.</p><p>
    For all its showy production tricks, though, the EP feels something like a work in progress, a young producer playing around with different sounds to figure out what suits him best. Most of the tracks don't have the fiery immediacy of something like ""Hands Up Thumbs Down"", and not all of the ideas work. And for anyone used to hearing club on radio mixshows or mix CDs, it'll always be a bit weird to hear a bunch of club tracks arranged as discrete individual songs, not given a chance to build on each other's momentum. But that's fine; this is a twelve-inch, after all, and it almost certainly works better as a DJ tool than as a stand-alone release. And it's still club music; even at its most complicated and counterintuitive, it's still funky and insistent as all hell. But it's also something more than that; when those chilly layers of vocal samples and stripped-down drum-loops work, they add up to something really exciting. If anyone is going to push club music outside Baltimore's city limits and turn it into the bizarre pop subgenre it could be, Blaqstarr could be the one.</p></div>"|10188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10188-supastarr-ep/|7.1|Tom Breihan

    bought synthesizers. Philadelphia-based quartet Hail Social trade the post-post-punk herky-jerky of their self-titled 2005 Polyvinyl debut for
    this year's self-released sophomore effort, <em>Modern
    Love and Death</em>, moving toward synth-pop without giving up the first album's
    dancefloor aspirations and plentiful hooks. The group seem to have lost some of their personality in the exchange.</p><p>
    Classics Dept. in-joke moniker aside, Hail Social have been
    slickly populist since the beginning. That's part of their appeal, but the
    watered-down vibe too often accompanying such boomer-friendly accessibility is
    also the band's biggest stumbling block. On <em>Modern Love and Death</em>, the shadow of radio nostalgia
    hanging over Hail Social's Franz Ferdinand-skinny, Duran Duran-humongoid debut
    (""Radio, radio,"" singer Dayve Hawk proclaimed) recurs both sonically
    and lyrically. ""All night, we can listen to the radio,"" Hawk suggests on vocoder-enhanced ""All Night"" over romantically gooey synths that could've been eBayed from fellow Philadelphians Hall &amp; Oates. A track later, the
    title number goes in for funky guitar licks and four-on-the-floor beats (too clean
    to be Shitdisco, not stark-raving enough for nu-rave) as Hawk imagines ""no
    more songs, no more favorites."" Could this be love? ""It felt a
    little more vacant,"" Hawk muses in his polished tenor.</p><p>
    At times <em>Modern Love
    &amp; Death </em>reaches radio-appropriate catchiness, but that doesn't mean the songs are necessarily memorable. Nothing here tops opener
    ""Annabelle"", with galloping drum programming and disco hi-hat
    decorating Hawk's sentimental reminiscence about a neighborhood bad girl.
    ""Hell belongs to us,"" he quips, but he's just as likely to repeat such standard-issue
    pop pleasantries as ""You're the only girl that I will ever love."" Where
    a group like Hot Chip would explore robot-of-love sonics and give even a song
    about (say) a ""Boy from School"" a distinctive angle, Hail Social's
    tunes sound like they could've been played at any 80s-themed party in the past
    five years. ""I don't know if I can live without you,"" Hawk worries on
    ""Heaven"", another standout in terms of tunefulness, if not aesthetic
    or, um, lyrics. <br/>
</p><p>
    Right, right, not everything people dance to needs to be Dostoevsky,
    let alone LCD Soundsystem, but Hail Social's lack of unique characteristics becomes
    a bigger bummer on the second half of <em>Modern
    Love and Death</em>. Y'all don't want this party to fizzle out early, right? ""One
    U Love"" blips and bleeps into rapidfire verses, but it's pretty much the
    tonight-let's-be-lovers rule that makes exceptions like Natasha Bedingfield's ""(I
    Wanna Have Your) Babies"" so refreshing. Then again, ""The Strangest Things""
    lurches into an insistent ""Blue Monday""-like bass line, but listen to
    the two tracks side by side and the differences between New Order's trailblazing
    genius and Hail Social's shiny, retro adequacy should be quickly apparent. Hail Social may be glad to give the people what they want, but they don't seem to know what people really want.

Recently signed to Matador, the Melbourne trio Love of Diagrams invoke this moment of revolt on <i>Mosaic</i>, their full-length debut. With mad scientific precision, they clone that factory-town aura of blankness and unrest, as well as the bohemian suspicions of structure and prettiness for its own sake. This may as wel be a love letter to 1978. It might also have been a mere period piece, but every detail is emotionally spot-on, a lovingly crafted balance of fury and malaise.</p>
<p>Even Love of Diagrams' bare-bones palette looks like a reaction to Thatcher-era excess. Opener ""Form and Function"" reveals a simple blueprint: nervous drumming from Monika Fikerle, low-frequency ennui from bassist Antonia Sellbach, all mantled by Luke Horton's guitarwork. After 2003's <i>The Target Is You</i>-- their wordless, Sonic Youth-inflected debut-- Horton and Sellbach proved they could do a great Thurston and Kim, too. Yet on its own, Sellbach's deadpan witch-chant calls to mind Siouxsie Sioux, or the other Kim. There's this classic, spellbinding hollowness to it.</p>
<p>And it works its magic on ""Pace or the Patience"", which zips from earthbound dub to a passage of chiming lightness before reverting, inevitably, back to Sellbach's wistful indictments: ""You came in with flying colors."" Meanwhile Horton, tired of pleasantries, yells past her, ""Well, can I give it to you?"" There are a million ways this can be protest song, and a million it can't. In ""At 100%"" it could go either way, too: the steely jerk and winking corporate-speak could pass as an attack on the workplace, modern love, or, what the hell, modern love in the workplace.</p>
<p>Better not to know. They are usually going so fast, riding their hurried Krautrock rhythms, they almost race past any stable meanings. But when they downshift to slower tempos, they tumble clearly from outrage to resignation. Somewhere under the sludge of ""Ms V Export"", you suspect, lurks a pop song, all the balladry filtered through Sellbach's robotic delivery. You can hear more notes of defeat, but in the coiled-spring, Devoesque ""Confrontation"", the hope drowns it out.</p>
<p>Granted, historical accuracy has its downside. No wave and post-punk came from cold places, after all, and for every lightning-flash of dark and dissonant drama, there were untold stretches of dreary, bloodless austerity. Love of Diagrams undoubtedly realize this. They have learned from their forebears' mistakes, keeping Mosaic predictably terse and tense, but they achieve something else: a strange spartan beauty, full of listlessness and all kinds of longing.</p></div>"|10185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10185-mosaic/|7.6|Roque Strew

    Fickle sadists that we are, we want our artists to lay their suffering out for us without being, you know, <em>too </em>emo-obvious about it. So even though Of Montreal's <em>Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?</em> leads off with the thesis statement ""we just want to emote 'til we're dead,"" we find ourselves too distracted by the shiny synthesizer baubles and merrily chugging machine rhythms to immediately pick up on the record's gloomy words and themes. By the time we realize the record is an auditory record-keeping of Kevin Barnes' marital and psychiatric struggles, the hooks are already sunk and we're singing along to his pain and agony, and feeling really good and terrible about it.</p><p>
    You'd think that trick wouldn't work again, that the bite-size format of <em>Hissing Fauna</em>'s sister EP, <em>Icons Abstract Thee</em>, would be an easier and happier pill to swallow. Wrong. Rather than cobbling together the chaff from <em>Hissing Fauna</em>, it's more like a condensed version-- the Reader's Digest summary of its parent album's themes and sound. In this highly concentrated form, Kevin Barnes' romantic anguish is even more difficult to voyeurize. Bearing in mind that the record is only 20 minutes long, there's a disturbingly high proportion of dear-diary lyrics dripping with self-loathing and anger:</p><p>
    1) ""Every thing is in the trash, and it's my fault/ I destroyed us, I know, it's unrecoverable""
    </p>
<p>
    2) ""I am a flaw/ I'm a mistake/ I am faulty/ Always break""
    </p>
<p>
    3) ""My heart is juvenile/ And my character's not so hot""
    </p>
<p>
    4) ""Please don't lose any sleep over me/ Baby, I hardly exist""
    </p>
<p>
    5) ""Is happiness even possible?""
    </p>
<p>
    6) ""Tonight I feel like I should just destroy myself""
    </p>
<p>
    7) ""I lost so much in our collapse/ Now my only hope is gone""
    </p>
<p>
    8) ""I'm killing myself, but it's not suicide""
    </p>
<p>
    9) ""I never ever wanted to write this song/ I always thought things would change somehow/ And we would start getting along/ But it's <em>hopelesssss</em>"" (italics for multi-Barnes overdub emphasis)
    </p>
<p>
    Yikes. But like <em>Hissing Fauna </em>before it, Barnes' bitter self-reflection is largely surrounded by a candied sugar shell, the same techno-updated hyper-pop the group is known for. Opening track ""Du Og Meg"", in fact, is probably closer to Of Montreal's early sound than anything on <em>Hissing Fauna</em>; its sunny guitar riffs and horn-section breakdown are vintage Elephant 6, and only the drum programming dispels the throwback illusion. A fairytale retelling of Barnes meeting his wife abroad, bringing her on tour to hock merch, and eventually proposing, the song's innocence also recalls the group's more romantic days, songs in love with love like <em>Coquelicot</em>'s gorgeous ""It's Just So"".
    </p>
<p>
    But this moment of fleeting happiness is just a cruel setup by narrator Barnes, and the rest of the EP is a headlong descent into DSM-IV depression. ""Voltaic Crusher"" is a peppy number more in line with the band's current synth-pop leanings, a busy rhythm track underscoring a melody competition between bass, guitar, and keyboards as Barnes pleads with God to send his wife a better man than him. ""Derailments in a Place of Our Own"" and ""Miss Blonde Your Papa Is Failing"" come closer to the sad-sack approach the band has astutely avoided, both largely solo acoustic tracks lacking the giddy complexity of the <em>Hissing Fauna</em> material, the arrangements trading gleeful escapism for seething anger and fragile honesty.
    </p>
<p>
    These stripped-down tracks are just a mellow calm before the climactic storm of ""No Conclusion"", the most ambitious and breathtaking portion of Barnes' pop opera of depression and despair. Consisting of roughly five songs sutured together Fiery Furnaces-style, ""No Conclusion"" is among the most complexly catchy contemplations of suicide ever committed to tape. Here, Barnes doesn't attempt to even flimsily cloak his feelings, going so far as to address himself by name within the song (""Don't worry, Kevin""), while the music hops maniacally from idea to idea behind him. The track is filled with meta-moments, most blatantly the two instances when Barnes mentions ""repeating"" before a multi-track loop is triggered; a clever joke, until the sad realization that there's not even a band present to share his pain, just a computer running Reason. By the end, Barnes reaches his most desperate point (see #9 above) and loops it relentlessly like self-flagellation...until a mournful string section echoing the chord progression gently ushers him off-stage. 
    </p>
<p>
    Those 10 minutes of music make <em>Icons, Abstract Thee</em> worthwhile all by themselves; after all, it is half the EP's running time, and will likely end up as one of 2007's finest musical accomplishments. It's a worthy final sequence to the saga that <em>Hissing Fauna </em>and <em>Icons, Abstract Thee</em> comprise, bravely integrating real-world emotion into Of Montreal's cartoonishly sugar-high sound while the band finishes its metamorphosis into a more electronics-based state. It's enough of an achievement that we can forgive being seduced by Barnes' pop talents into dancing to his anguish; let's just hope he has happier experiences to report on next time around.

    There are plenty of reasons to write off Lavender Diamond as intolerably precious: their bandname, their showtune-like arrangements and vocals, or frontwoman Becky Stark's billowy pink dresses that make comparisons to Princess Toadstool just <em>slightly</em> too easy. To date, the band's most excessive gestures have been their most successful.   The recently re-released <em>Cavalry of Light</em> EP reaches its apex with its opening track: ""You Broke My Heart"" is a bulletproof wide-eyed stomper that embraces the band's potentially cloying approach with gusto.</p><p>
    Until now, Lavender Diamond had struck me as a band willing to plunge unreservedly into its own aesthetic world-- to embrace theatrical bombast without stopping to look over its shoulder. But with the release of their debut album, there's already some speculation as to whether Stark's fruity delivery can be chalked up to genuine eccentricity or art-school put-on. Of course, any kind of wink-and-nod assurances that Lavender Diamond are ""in"" on their own shtick would have destroyed their mystique. And similarly, any attempts to temper their sound with rote signifiers of sincerity would have stripped them of the persuasive charm that made their EP so promising.</p><p>
    Miraculously, Lavender Diamond manage to evade both of these traps on <em>Imagine Our Love</em>. But there's a potentially bigger problem: Rather than developing or disavowing their penchant for glittery spectacle, they play it just a little bit too safe throughout, delivering a record with few glaring flaws but just as few highlights.</p><p>
    ""You Broke My Heart"" finds its near-equal in ""Open Your Heart"", bringing to mind what ""Downtown"" might sound like had it originally been performed by Julie Andrews instead of Petula Clark. The melody and flow of ""Here Comes One"" has a ""Sesame Street Theme""-like irresistibility .  ""Like an Arrow"" is less melodic and more meditative, but manages to cultivate a mood without falling back on sheer ambiance. But there isn't much else of note beyond these few moments. Stripped-down, bluesier numbers like ""Side of the Lord"" and ""Garden Rose"" offer a welcome respite from the record's usual pageantry, but the subtlety and repetition that enhance Lavender Diamond's best songs also doom these weaker ones. Most of the hooks on <em>Imagine Our Love</em> appear within the first 30 seconds of their respective songs, and when that initial idea needs work, as is often the case, its gradual development and expansion doesn't exactly make for an enthralling listen.  </p><p>
    Given the amount of attention Lavender Diamond has received lately, it's easy to forget that this is their debut album.  Though ""You Broke My Heart"" made for an incredibly solid and self-assured first step, <em>Imagine Our Love</em> finds the band not quite sure how to deliver on their strengths.  Which, for all the hype and expectation, is hardly the worst that could happen.<br/>

Therefore, when Indie Band X drops a debut album stylistically stitching together, say, Italian disco and early Modest Mouse, the accomplishment's somewhat demystified by the insane amount of exposure we all enjoy in the Information Age. Despite this phenomenon, Brooklyn's Alex Delivery sounds intent on blowing your mind on their expansive and ambitious debut, even if you're familiar with all their go-to tools and tricks.</p><p>
    In many ways, <em>Star Destroyer</em> sounds like prog tailored for a hipster audience that hates nearly everything prog's about (dramatic climaxes, technical proficiency, rich instrumentation), though likes having several chic genres crammed down their throat on nine minute-plus tracks. Furthermore, many of these songs contain a strange blend of aestheticism and ascetism, whether by preemptively deflating a potentially epic melody or shaving down noisy krautrock into harmless laptop pop. Catchy opener ""Komad"", for example, initially extends Sebadoh's lo-fi pop to the same cacophonous degree as Iran's <em>Moon Boys</em>, though midway through transmogrifies into a space-age motorik freakout, its mechanical synths and beeps starkly contrasting frontman Robert Lombardo's all-too-human vocals.</p><p>
<em>Star Destroyer</em> may be a pretty opaque record, particularly on first listen, but its brief flashes of hooks often shine through the murky krautrock and shoegaze. The mild pretentiousness of ""Komad"" comes down to earth on ""Rainbows"", the following track. Canned strings and soothing keyboards compliment Lombardo's serene vocals, unlike other passages on the album where feedback squalls and jarring percussion poke holes in the leading melody. At just over two minutes, ""Scotty"" feels like an insignificant blip sandwiched between two behemoth tracks, though the track's goofy carnival feel provides a much-needed break from the plodding stoicism of <em>Star Destroyer</em>'s longer songs.</p><p>
    The drastic shift from tight and catchy to protracted and cerebral is easily <em>Star Destroyer</em>'s most frustrating characteristic. While the binary works on a song like ""Komad"", other lengthy tracks like ""Sheath-Wet"" and ""Milan"" fail to create stylistically disparate sections that are equally interesting, degenerating instead into repetitive jams that never quite jell. This is not a plea for catchier songs, either, but rather for more ear-grabbing ideas that can unfold over a nine-minute track coherently. Thankfully, these guys show a glimpse of that promise with closer ""Vesna"", an intergalactic ballad reminiscent of David Bowie's Berlin albums. As their gorgeous impressionistic album art indicates, Alex Delivery loves revealing pretty ideas at obtuse angles, always wary of cheapening their songs with direct, straightforward hooks. Even more promising, they clearly have the encyclopedic musical knowledge and sonic mastery to craft an album that both borrows from their influences and puts a unique, innovative spin on them. For now, however, Alex Delivery's got a bit of a mad scientist streak, still searching for some method to their madness.</p></div>"|10170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10170-star-destroyer/|6.7|Adam Moerder

    Amandine is a geographical conundrum. Start with their second LP, <em>Solace in Sore Hands</em>, and try to pick the
    region of the American mainland Amandine calls home. Opener ""Faintest of
    Sparks""-- with its sinister banjo rail and hard-lined persistence that
    together recall the ""The House Carpenter""-- makes its writer seem
    like a Southeastern Americana immigrant, moving somewhere in the Appalachians
    on the heels of a bitter breakup and an introduction to Harry Smith. But then
    there's the earthen imagery of ""Better Soil"" and its major-chord
    acoustic jangle, bolstered by a maladjusted fiddle and clanging piano.
    Mellencamp is from Bloomington, right, and that place is an indie rock nexus?
    But so are Athens and Seattle, and ""Silver Bells"", all strident strum
    and stuttering drums, makes Amandine sound like it spent half a decade camping
    with the Shins outside of Sub-Pop's window.</p><p>
    Here's something surprising, though: Amandine is a four-piece from the
    Southern tip of Sweden, and they're fronted by Olof Gidlöf. Not John, James,
    Sam, or Joe-- Olof. And as charming as it may seem in theory for a band to
    explore the connections between American roots music and its Scandinavian
    counterpart, Amandine does so without a strong sense of self. <em>Solace in Sore Hands</em> sounds exactly like
    another faceless album about distance putting pressure on stretched
    heartstrings. Gildöf occasionally seems optimistic for his future, but his
    misery and the circumstances he laments-- war, small towns, traveling careers--
    are his preferred muses.</p><p>
    In one sense, this resembles the approach of the band's 2004 debut <em>Leave Out the Sad Parts</em>, but, sonically,
    Amandine is bigger now. There's a tightly controlled veil of electric feedback
    on ""Faintest of Sparks"", and ""Our Nameless Will"" splits its
    choruses and verses between plucked banjo and overdriven guitar paired with
    big, languid rock drums and bass, respectively. By those terms, though, every
    piece of Amandine's discography has hitherto been only another point in making
    Gidlöf's laments a little more dramatic, a little bit louder. Such excuses only
    go so far, and here, regardless of the band's past, the climaxes and crescendos
    are rushed, pre-emptive, and undeserved. On ""Chores of the Heart"",
    Amandine goes straight for the throat, springing from a one-guitar, 35-second
    intro into a loud first verse, complete with a plodding rhythm section and a
    howling organ. But there's little other excitability. Still, the guitar somehow
    manages to believe Gidlöf when he concludes, ""We've been wading in water
    so dark/ Now we're drowning in the chores of the heart."" 
    </p>
<p>
    Gidlöf is writing about the same motif of impending heartbreak he's mined
    for three years now, but he still doesn't <em>own</em>
    it. David Karsten Daniels, who shares the Fat Cat mantle with Amandine now, has
    based both of his albums around one breakup: The first, 2004's independently
    released <em>Angles</em>,<em> </em>was grief-stricken but undecided. It felt
    as if Daniels was still too sad to make a sustained, articulate statement. But
    this year's <em>Sharp Teeth</em> was a bold
    move, its arrangements-- Dixieland funeral marches, distended crescendos,
    painfully quiet brooding-- proclaiming that Daniels had finally conquered his
    hurt and used it to his advantage. Gidlöf lacks the conviction to direct his
    troubles into either strong songs or fodder for his clearly capable band. His
    three-shades-of-grey writing opens the door for any old arrangement that will
    do, and the band generally mirrors its principal writer, taking the tired sound
    that comes with the least resistance.

Nadel relates an anecdote that seems too perfectly symbolic to be true: A teenaged Cohen, after reading a book on hypnotism, successfully hypnotizes and undresses the family maid. This is the stuff of parable, presaging the hands-on mysticism, conflicted morality, and voracious lust that would come to define Cohen's art. The story also speaks to the peculiar effect of his music-- few singers leave us feeling so mesmerized and vulnerable.</p><p>
    On paper, Cohen's music is astoundingly simple. Because he became well-known as a poet and novelist in his 20s, there's a popular misconception that he didn't begin to play music until he started releasing albums in his 30s. But he became infatuated with the guitar at an early age, played in a country band called the Buckskin Boys at McGill University, and accompanied his poetry readings with live jazz, inspired by the Beat poets for whom he was a little too aristocratic to be taken seriously. He didn't become known as a musician until his 30s, but he was moving toward it his whole life, in an attempt to put his poetry where he thought it belonged-- with the people, not the academy.</p><p>
    Because of this long gestation period, Cohen's music seemed to emerge fully formed, and the qualities that dominate his first three, newly reissued albums can be succinctly cataloged. There's his reedy baritone-- a humble, melancholy  instrument and an inviting source of warmth; there's his unique guitar style-- most of his songs are built from delicate webs of musky, finger-picked flamenco or broad, awkward chord progressions; and there are his lyrics, tracing out the hidden contours of love, lust, sex, religion, responsibility, and history through an inflexibly personal lens.
    </p><p>
    There's also the uncanny ambiance of the songs, the almost brutal frugality of which is offset by calliope, bells, keyboards, strings, horns, and Jew's harp. While Cohen was resistant to such embellishments and particularly displeased with John Simon's arrangements on his debut, they've worn into the songs' creases. These reissues do a good job of bringing out the instrumentation
    without crowding Cohen's voice or tainting the music's dark thrall, and an early version included on <em>Songs from a Room</em> reveals that ""Bird on a Wire"" isn't quite ""Bird on a Wire"" without those drafty keyboards pushing in under it. 
    </p>
<p>
    This is enough to explain why these albums are good, but what makes them great is the ongoing search for personal truth and spiritual grace that they express, and how they manage to always embody both sides of their thematic coin. Everything is married to its dark twin: Freedom and shelter in ""The Stranger Song"", laughter and tears in ""So Long, Marianne"", salvation and destruction in ""Joan of Arc"", whom Cohen often used as a symbol for spiritual discipline and the power of womanhood. 
    </p>
<p>
    We find this same dual nature in Cohen himself: Born to a stern religious father and a bohemian mother, Cohen's sensibility was forged in the tension between the liberal and the conservative. He's been a religious sensualist, a student of police work and law, bourgeois outsider poet, and disciplined dabbler in marijuana and LSD. While he emerged as a Dylan-inspired folkie, his music was anachronistic and only nominally political, less concerned with the timely issues of the day than the timeless issues of the spirit. Cohen was interested in ""The Old Revolution"", with its outmoded concepts of chivalry, and its religious (not secular) imperatives. The political ferment of the 60s manifests only obliquely, as in ""Story of Isaac"", which is as much about Cohen's awe of his father's stern religion as it is about the sacrifice of youths upon the altar of war. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's appropriate then that Cohen's songs present him to us in far-flung locales. ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" finds him in a cold New York hotel, catching snippets of music wafting up from Clinton Street. In ""So Long, Marianne"", he's probably on Hydra, a pale spectre amid the Grecian island's greenery and whitewashed terraces. In ""Suzanne"", eating Chinese oranges on the St. Lawrence river in Montreal. In ""Diamonds in the Mine"", checking his empty mailbox on an isolated farm outside of Nashville. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    All three of these albums, despite their musical simplicity, are leavened with the wisdom that comes from such a diverse existence. 1968's <em>Songs of Leonard Cohen </em>contains many of his most essential songs-- ""Suzanne"", ""Master Song"", ""Stranger Song"", ""Sisters of Mercy"", ""So Long, Marianne""-- and establishes the themes and stylistic tics he would pursue relentlessly over the ensuing decades. John Hammond, the album's original
    producer, fell ill during the process and was replaced by John Simon;
    the two bonus cuts are from the Hammond sessions. ""Store Room"" emulates the
    restrained urgency of ""Teachers"" while ""Blessed is the Memory"" is more
    prayerful; both feature rather incongruous Ray Manzarek-style organs.
    </p>
<p>
    A long-time country music fan, Cohen would travel to Nashville to record his next two albums. 1969's <em>Songs From a Room</em> is similar to his debut: Just as <em>Songs of Leonard Cohen</em> replaced original producer John Hammond, who had signed Cohen to Columbia (as well as Billie Holiday and Bob Dylan) with John Simon (then just off the Band's <em>Music From Big Pink </em>and Simon and Garfunkel's <em>Bookends</em>), this album was started with the Byrds' David Crosby and finished with Dylan producer Bob Johnston. It also contains a number of Cohen's signature tunes, including ""Story of Isaac"", cover song ""The Partisan"", ""Lady Midnight"", and the seminal ""Bird on a Wire"", whose iconic opening lines (""Like a bird on a wire/ Like a drunk in a midnight choir/ I have tried, in my way, to be free"") were cited by Kris Kristofferson as his desired epitaph. It seems a direct continuation of his debut, and in truth, the debut seems superior simply for having come first.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, any seeker can become lost, and on 1971's <em>Songs of Love and Hate</em>, Cohen shows signs of disorientation. Though he's backed by a crew of ace musicians, including Charlie Daniels on fiddle, the record is thinner and less even than the first two. In contrast to his early precision, Cohen takes some wild swings that miss the mark, such as the weird Santa Claus imagery on ""Dress Rehearsal Rag"" and the uncomfortably strained singing style he adopts on ""Diamonds in the Mine"", which might be chalked up to an insecurity about his voice encouraged by his negative press. It's also a more blatantly depressive album than the first two, lacking hopeful equanimity, and does indeed reflect a period of great depression and uncertainty in Cohen's life. 
    </p>
<p>
    But elsewhere on <em>Love and Hate</em>, he's in his finest, subtlest form-- ""Avalanche"", ""Last Year's Man"", and ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" alone justify the album's classic status. Despite its relative flaws, it's an indispensable document in the development of one of the 20th century's most enduring artists.

Nadel relates an anecdote that seems too perfectly symbolic to be true: A teenaged Cohen, after reading a book on hypnotism, successfully hypnotizes and undresses the family maid. This is the stuff of parable, presaging the hands-on mysticism, conflicted morality, and voracious lust that would come to define Cohen's art. The story also speaks to the peculiar effect of his music-- few singers leave us feeling so mesmerized and vulnerable.</p><p>
    On paper, Cohen's music is astoundingly simple. Because he became well-known as a poet and novelist in his 20s, there's a popular misconception that he didn't begin to play music until he started releasing albums in his 30s. But he became infatuated with the guitar at an early age, played in a country band called the Buckskin Boys at McGill University, and accompanied his poetry readings with live jazz, inspired by the Beat poets for whom he was a little too aristocratic to be taken seriously. He didn't become known as a musician until his 30s, but he was moving toward it his whole life, in an attempt to put his poetry where he thought it belonged-- with the people, not the academy.</p><p>
    Because of this long gestation period, Cohen's music seemed to emerge fully formed, and the qualities that dominate his first three, newly reissued albums can be succinctly cataloged. There's his reedy baritone-- a humble, melancholy  instrument and an inviting source of warmth; there's his unique guitar style-- most of his songs are built from delicate webs of musky, finger-picked flamenco or broad, awkward chord progressions; and there are his lyrics, tracing out the hidden contours of love, lust, sex, religion, responsibility, and history through an inflexibly personal lens.
    </p><p>
    There's also the uncanny ambiance of the songs, the almost brutal frugality of which is offset by calliope, bells, keyboards, strings, horns, and Jew's harp. While Cohen was resistant to such embellishments and particularly displeased with John Simon's arrangements on his debut, they've worn into the songs' creases. These reissues do a good job of bringing out the instrumentation
    without crowding Cohen's voice or tainting the music's dark thrall, and an early version included on <em>Songs from a Room</em> reveals that ""Bird on a Wire"" isn't quite ""Bird on a Wire"" without those drafty keyboards pushing in under it. 
    </p>
<p>
    This is enough to explain why these albums are good, but what makes them great is the ongoing search for personal truth and spiritual grace that they express, and how they manage to always embody both sides of their thematic coin. Everything is married to its dark twin: Freedom and shelter in ""The Stranger Song"", laughter and tears in ""So Long, Marianne"", salvation and destruction in ""Joan of Arc"", whom Cohen often used as a symbol for spiritual discipline and the power of womanhood. 
    </p>
<p>
    We find this same dual nature in Cohen himself: Born to a stern religious father and a bohemian mother, Cohen's sensibility was forged in the tension between the liberal and the conservative. He's been a religious sensualist, a student of police work and law, bourgeois outsider poet, and disciplined dabbler in marijuana and LSD. While he emerged as a Dylan-inspired folkie, his music was anachronistic and only nominally political, less concerned with the timely issues of the day than the timeless issues of the spirit. Cohen was interested in ""The Old Revolution"", with its outmoded concepts of chivalry, and its religious (not secular) imperatives. The political ferment of the 60s manifests only obliquely, as in ""Story of Isaac"", which is as much about Cohen's awe of his father's stern religion as it is about the sacrifice of youths upon the altar of war. 
    </p>
<p>
    It's appropriate then that Cohen's songs present him to us in far-flung locales. ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" finds him in a cold New York hotel, catching snippets of music wafting up from Clinton Street. In ""So Long, Marianne"", he's probably on Hydra, a pale spectre amid the Grecian island's greenery and whitewashed terraces. In ""Suzanne"", eating Chinese oranges on the St. Lawrence river in Montreal. In ""Diamonds in the Mine"", checking his empty mailbox on an isolated farm outside of Nashville. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    All three of these albums, despite their musical simplicity, are leavened with the wisdom that comes from such a diverse existence. 1968's <em>Songs of Leonard Cohen </em>contains many of his most essential songs-- ""Suzanne"", ""Master Song"", ""Stranger Song"", ""Sisters of Mercy"", ""So Long, Marianne""-- and establishes the themes and stylistic tics he would pursue relentlessly over the ensuing decades. John Hammond, the album's original
    producer, fell ill during the process and was replaced by John Simon;
    the two bonus cuts are from the Hammond sessions. ""Store Room"" emulates the
    restrained urgency of ""Teachers"" while ""Blessed is the Memory"" is more
    prayerful; both feature rather incongruous Ray Manzarek-style organs.
    </p>
<p>
    A long-time country music fan, Cohen would travel to Nashville to record his next two albums. 1969's <em>Songs From a Room</em> is similar to his debut: Just as <em>Songs of Leonard Cohen</em> replaced original producer John Hammond, who had signed Cohen to Columbia (as well as Billie Holiday and Bob Dylan) with John Simon (then just off the Band's <em>Music From Big Pink </em>and Simon and Garfunkel's <em>Bookends</em>), this album was started with the Byrds' David Crosby and finished with Dylan producer Bob Johnston. It also contains a number of Cohen's signature tunes, including ""Story of Isaac"", cover song ""The Partisan"", ""Lady Midnight"", and the seminal ""Bird on a Wire"", whose iconic opening lines (""Like a bird on a wire/ Like a drunk in a midnight choir/ I have tried, in my way, to be free"") were cited by Kris Kristofferson as his desired epitaph. It seems a direct continuation of his debut, and in truth, the debut seems superior simply for having come first.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, any seeker can become lost, and on 1971's <em>Songs of Love and Hate</em>, Cohen shows signs of disorientation. Though he's backed by a crew of ace musicians, including Charlie Daniels on fiddle, the record is thinner and less even than the first two. In contrast to his early precision, Cohen takes some wild swings that miss the mark, such as the weird Santa Claus imagery on ""Dress Rehearsal Rag"" and the uncomfortably strained singing style he adopts on ""Diamonds in the Mine"", which might be chalked up to an insecurity about his voice encouraged by his negative press. It's also a more blatantly depressive album than the first two, lacking hopeful equanimity, and does indeed reflect a period of great depression and uncertainty in Cohen's life. 
    </p>
<p>
    But elsewhere on <em>Love and Hate</em>, he's in his finest, subtlest form-- ""Avalanche"", ""Last Year's Man"", and ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" alone justify the album's classic status. Despite its relative flaws, it's an indispensable document in the development of one of the 20th century's most enduring artists. Cohen potently captures the pull between safety and the unknown, love and freedom, spirituality and sensuality: a panoramic view of human experience, rendered through the work of one exceptional artist.

On Seefeel's MySpace page, there's live footage of ""Industrious""-- from their 1993 album <em>Quique</em>-- at a Russian festival in '94. The band doesn't quite stand still; bassist Darren Seymour does some kind of spastic dance during the bridge. But something about the basic immobility of the band-- attempting to recreate its pulsing, programmed loops live on stage, a music that pours My Bloody Valentine's oozing pink and purple plasma onto techno's chrome skeleton-- is tied to a long-gone age of implacable MIDI-sequencing, lacking the real-time software flux available to Christian Fennesz or the freedom of movement enjoyed by modern cyborg bands like Battles.</p><p>
    But only a maniac would claim that Kraftwerk's neon lights shine any less brightly because they didn't have Ableton Live, and Seefeel's music continues to sparkle 14 years later, an entire generation having built an ambient-motorik noise-pop aesthetic around <em>Quique</em> songs like ""Plainsong"". Too Pure finally brings the album back into print after far too long with this double-disc ""Redux Edition"", and listening now, you'll hear the beginnings of a still-thriving genre that remains slippery and unnamed, purely electronic music with a strange, tangy rock aftertaste-- think Tim Hecker's own post-shoegaze explorations into ultra-violet noise, Nathan Fake's plastic techno My Bloody Valentine homages, M83's heavily sequenced Vangeliscapes, a good chunk of the Darla Records catalog, and the  twinkling textures of Mouse on Mars, who sent Too Pure a mash note with their demo after they had become infatuated with <em>Quique</em>. Even starting out in a genre where texture and noise already did much of the heavy lifting, the ""rock band"" version of Seefeel was just a shadow on the studio wall by the time of <em>Quique</em>, making it kind of proto-IDM before the genre even really had a name.</p><p>
    And in this rock-free space, the eight minutes of opener ""Climatic Phase No. 3"" actually sound like ""Comedown Phase No. 3"". It's just the barest tinkling of percussion, a rising and falling bass line to provide a barely audible pulse guiding the track, and the laziest melody Kevin Shields or Robin Guthrie never wrote. Not afraid to name a song ""Spangle"", that most overused of adjectives when it comes to post-Cocteau Twins' guitar atmospherics, Seefeel's canvas on <em>Quique</em> was the azure 8-bit horizon of a computer game where the band blew pixilated clouds that spritzed digital mist and crafted minimal hooks from just hypnotic smears of faraway feedback and Sarah Peacock's nape-of-your-neck intimate whispers.</p><p>
    Needless to say, if Seefeel's pace gets to, say, mid-tempo, the band's pretty damn worked up. The songs stretch out like groggy limbs after a mid-day nap, and the band is often at its best when it's at its most languid, as on the impossibly sensual and nearly static ""Filter Dub"". The underrated, understated rhythm work--rarely brought up when critics like me start talking alliterative nonsense about vapor trails and guitar swooshes--scrapes and pulses more than it pounds or strides, often recalling a stiff Kraftwerkian metal-on-metal version of polyrhythmic sway of Polynesian percussion. The silvery splash of the cymbals on ""Industrious"" is just another harmonic color in the palette; the chittering ""Through You"" sounds like gamelan recast with Atari-era tools.</p><p>
    In the band's attempt escape rock's orbit, the second disc of nine unreleased tracks and rare cuts melts any remaining physicality away until all that's left is, as the band titles the last track, a ""Silent Pool"", even removing most of the ""techno"" from ""ambient techno."" The ""avant garde"" mix of ""Charlotte's Mouth"" mutes the original's percussion until it's the spectral, washed-out blur of an underdeveloped Polaroid, and the eerie ""My Super 20"" blows barren winds as cold the bleakest tracks on AFX's <em>Selected Ambient Works II</em> or the arctic static of Thomas Koner. Moving to labels like Warp and Rephlex and exploring a more purely electronic sound--guitarist Mark Clifford went on to a long and fruitful techno career as Disjecta and other pseudonyms--was perhaps Seefeel's only option as they forced a rock/techno fusion that the technology of the time couldn't quite accommodate. But while it would have undoubtedly been interesting to see where the band might have gone in the anything-goes laptop age, <em>Quique</em> still sounds timeless.</p></div>"|9993.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9993-quique-redux-edition/|8.4|Jess Harvell

    Already David Wingo's résumé has been discussed almost as
    much as his music. He is a film composer by day, most notably for the movies of southern director David Gordon Green (including his upcoming <em>Snow Angels</em>), and this experience may or
    may not be relevant to his debut with his band Ola Podrida. It's tempting to
    read these 11 songs on the group's debut as extensions of Wingo's
    soundtracks, as the band name implies: Ola Podrida is a variation on the
    Spanish term <em>olla podrida</em>, which
    refers specifically to a stew and generally to any sort of miscellany. <em>Podrida</em> itself means rotten, suggesting
    a dish made of ingredients unused in previous recipes. The implication is that
    this group is a secondary outlet for Wingo and the album a catch-all for
    mood-setting music that didn't fit into a film.</p><p>
    If that's really the case, it's impossible to tell.<em> Ola Podrida</em> is a cohesive, confident album
    full of folky, quiet guitars and thoughtful lyrics that coalesce into
    complete songs. But what sets the group apart from similar acts like Iron &amp;
    Wine and Paul Duncan is its cinematic flair: Wingo treats his words like
    images, so that the music acts like a soundtrack that gently reinforces their
    meaning and impact. These songs are like short films-- action sequences (the
    fiery ""Cindy""), montages (the humorous ""Photo Booth""), denouements (the stark
    closer ""Eastbound"")-- but the band's spartan sound never makes that idea too
    obvious. Ola Podrida, which began with Wingo as its sole member but has grown
    to a full lineup, make the most of only a handful of instruments: Acoustic guitars
    pluck ruminative melodies while synths softly suggest atmosphere. Singing with
    an open twang that sounds both observant and expressive, Wingo performs most
    songs by himself, even playing piano on ""Eastbound"".</p><p>
    Appropriately, Wingo's lyrics emphasize the visual, and his
    songs are full of off-hand concrete imagery, such as these lines from ""Day at
    the Beach"": ""I played in the waves like a five-year old, timing my jumps with
    the rolling tide"". However, the songs are most effective when he leaves certain
    specifics to the listener's imagination. In the middle of the plaintive ""Run
    Off the Road"", in which a woman gauges her life's course through the changes in
    her old home, he sings, ""When you showed up at the farm, visions of the summer
    flying past you/ The foxes had torn up the mother and her pups, and the well was
    full of flies."" The violence occurs off-screen, but its aftermath lingers in
    this southern gothic quatrain, feeding the song's meaning and mystery.
    </p>
<p>
    All is not so bleak. ""Photo Booth"", about lovers slowly growing apart,
    repeats a playful refrain: ""Dog's asleep out in the yard, cat's up on the roof/
    We're out drinking at the bar, down each other's pants in the photo booth.""
    Wingo's characters-- all of the lovers, friends, acquaintances, passers-by who
    inhabit these songs-- hover teasingly between real and fictional, suggesting
    typical songwriterly confessionalism but slyly undermining those expectations.
    For this reason, ""Jordanna"" is one of the album's many triumphs, showcasing not
    only Wingo's shapeshifting songwriting (in which verses bleed into choruses
    with such fluidity that it's often difficult to distinguish the two) but also
    his descriptive powers. The song is an ode to a powerful performer, and the
    words and music give listeners front-row seats: ""You drink from your flask and
    ask if anyone here has a favorite,"" he sings, then adds, ""I don't care what you
    play, just do it in your old fashioned way."" Wingo sounds like he wants to
    believe in the power of music to set the world to rights, and on ""Jordanna"" he
    comes away with what seems at first like cold comfort, but reveals a musical
    generosity that's almost like a mission statement: ""I don't know if there's any
    point to it all, but I sure like hearing your voice.""

    the price is right. But the Jesus and Mary Chain's Jim and William Reid and
    Ben Lurie are the only ones who can claim to be reuniting twice. However, if they did Coachella for the money, then their other recent venture-- backing up the youngest Reid sibling, Linda, in Sister Vanilla-- appears to be for the love. Or, at least, their participation suggests a token gesture
    of gratitude to the one person who can probably keep the two brothers from
    kicking the shit out of each other.</p><p>
    Though <em>Little Pop Rock</em> is Sister Vanilla's first album, the lineup
    effectively formed on the Mary Chain's 1998 swan song <em>Munki</em>, on which Linda lent her pretty-vacant vocals to
    the revved-up Ramones pastiche ""Mo Tucker"", a sprightly performance that
    contrasted sharply with the femme-fatale cameos the band routinely farmed
    out to Hope Sandoval. Nine years later, this enthusiasm appears unabated on <em>Little Pop Rock</em>, on
    which Linda sings with the wide-eyed wonder of a fan girl who gets to front
    her favorite band: ""<em>Honey's Dead</em> and <em>Psychocandy</em>, I listened to them all
    the time,"" she sings on ""K to Be Lost"", her sense of awe undiminished by the
    fact she's related to the guys who made them.</p><p>
    As it's genetically impossible for the Reid clan to sound like anything
    other than the Jesus and Mary Chain, it's no surprise that <em>Little Pop Rock</em>'s
    acid-casual serenades-- centered primarily on the symbiotic relationship
    between getting high and feeling low-- could've featured on any Mary Chain
    album from <em>Darklands</em> onward. And that's a comment on both the songs' lack of
    deviation from the JAMC's Sunday-morning-Velvets songbook, and the songs'
    consistent quality and unhurried charm.</p><p>
    But the steady, metronomic nature of rockers like ""Jamcolas"" (just like the
    title says: the JAMC gone pop) and the cheeky <em>Let It Bleed</em> tribute ""Delicat""
    is undercut by a more free-spirited approach to the album's quieter moments,
    like the casually anarchic piano plinking that closes the opening ""Pastel
    Blue"", a gentle acoustic lullaby wherein Linda recounts a car crash caused
    by her zoning out to the Pastels. How appropriate then that <em>Little Pop Rock</em> comes full circle with ""The Two of Us"", a closing Stephen Pastel duet
    powered by an inviting Stereolab drone that provides the proverbial
    exclamation point to a mutually beneficial family affair: The sister gets to

    Joseph Arthur has about as much freedom as a
    musician can get. He has his own studio, owns his own record label, and has a
    backing band on call whenever he needs them. Let his sixth album then stand as
    a reminder that, sometimes, freedom isn't a good thing. <em>Let's Just Be</em> sounds like it came together on the fly, in jam
    sessions that didn't stem from any kind of solid idea. There are moments on the
    album that left me speechless the first time I heard them. I just don't think I
    was properly equipped to process the precipitous drop in quality between Joseph
    Arthur's past offerings and this one.</p><p>
    Arthur peaked in 2004 with <em>Our Shadows Will Remain</em>, a lucid, occasionally even ingenious
    meditation on living in a time of war. But here it's difficult to find any focus.
    Moreover, Arthur's tendency toward experimentation seems to have devolved to
    rote sonic noodling that goes nowhere. There are a few quality tracks among these 16-- enough for a
    pretty good EP-- but this is an 80-minute album with at least an hour of
    stuff on it that sounds at best like studio outtakes.</p><p>
    I can get behind the gentle acoustics and subtle electronic
    shading of ""Take Me Home"", for instance-- it has a fragile beauty that echoes
    some of his best quiet work for Real World and Vector. The album's nine-minute
    finale, ""Star Song"", has some of that as well, combining an American roots
    aesthetic with some vaguely South Asian overtones, harmonica rubbing up against
    guitars tuned and processed to sound like sitars. It's startling to hear
    something so interesting and affecting close out a record like this, and it at
    least leaves some hope that this is merely a short detour in Arthur's career
    and not a sign of things to come. 
    </p>
<p>
    Beyond those songs, though, there's not much. ""Lonely
    Astronaut"", the album's 20-minute centerpiece, begins on reasonably solid
    ground, with acoustic guitars strumming away, but Arthur's gravelly voice
    sounds like it doesn't even know the lyrics and he falls way down in the mix.
    After a certain point it just wanders off into a hideously boring vamp with
    sounds randomly rising and falling as voices repeat single syllables over and
    over but not in any particular pattern or rhythm. Listening to the whole thing,
    which I've done several times now, is genuinely grueling. It's exhibit A in the
    argument that having 80 minutes available on a CD doesn't mean you have to fill
    it.
    </p>
<p>
    Other songs are terrible for more pedestrian reasons. He
    sounds more like he's puking than singing as he screeches his way through
    ""Cockteeze"" over lumbering, sloppy riff rock, but it's not nearly as horrendous
    as ""Shake It Off"", where he sounds like he's trying to imitate first an eagle and then a sheep as he
    vocalizes the title refrain. It might be a joke, but if you weren't in the studio when it was recorded, it's not very funny. The next song is unironically titled ""Lack a
    Vision"", and though it's merely boring and not outright bad, it's truly an
    unfortunate phrase to have on the album's back cover. 
    </p>
<p>
    There's plenty of evidence outside of the general sloppiness
    of the playing and forced-sounding ""out there"" production that this was kicked
    together in great haste: witness Arthur instructing the band on the form of the
    song in the middle of the already rehearsal-ish ""Yer the Reason"". He could have
    at least overdubbed the planned solo he mumbles about. It's almost
    disappointing that there's any good music on this thing, because the bits he
    seems to really be engaged with, like the faux-country of ""Precious One"" or the
    folky ""Gimmie Some Company"", are bound to be lost along with the rest of it, much
    of which is simply unendurable. Here's hoping he got it out of his system.

For the classmates he's leaving behind? For that van full of kids who drove drunk into the storm ditch after prom? No, if the speaker is Carey Mercer, who fronts Victoria, B.C.'s Frog Eyes, he's bawling because he's supposed to be an adult now and what's more a
    man, but there are no men around, only military
    blowhards, craven merchants, and drunken dads.</p><p>
    Frog Eyes have been a band more namechecked than listened to, thanks to now-and-then keyboardist Spencer Krug's other groups (Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown), and Mercer's collaboration last year with Krug and Dan Bejar of Destroyer under the guise of Swan Lake. While Mercer shares his friends' elliptical and bombastic rhetoric, he's at once more of an orator and more of a synesthesist, working with smears and splatters more than melodies, and bringing his own fixations.</p><p>
<em>Tears of the Valedictorian</em> is Frog Eyes' first substantial advance since 2003's <em>The Golden River</em>, which was a fanciful songcycle on a backdrop of ecological anxiety. <em>The Folded Palm</em> (2004) approximated the frenzy of their shows, but at the expense of the songs. The intervening mini-albums were pleasant small-scale studies. <em>Valedictorian</em> again mobilizes the band's full palette-- Mercer's wife Melanie Campbell's stomping drums and flat stutter cymbals, Krug's keyboards switching from crosshatch shadows to radiant showers, Michael Rak's grounding bass, Mercer's and McCloud Zicmuse's light-seeking insect guitars and, always, Mercer's gibbering, his croon, his grumbles, his yodeling yip.</p><p>
    Mercer stands in the lineage of rock frontman as half-carnival-barker, half-gnostic-preacher that Greil Marcus describes as the ""crank prophet,"" from Screamin' Jay Hawkins through Arthur Lee of Love, Captain Beefheart, David Thomas of Pere Ubu, Tom Waits, and the Pixies' Frank Black. But Frog Eyes' sound owes more to early Roxy Music-- music that filtered out blues in favor of high modernism-- as well as advertising jingles and John Philip Sousa. In keeping with Victoria's Brit-dominated demographics, it also recalls English music hall, though the hall is on a riverboat and the river on fire.</p><p>
    Mercer's preoccupation here seems to be masculinity, as it often has been in rock, the music of boys coming of age. But unlike Mick Jagger or Bruce Springsteen (whose trace, as so often these days, shows up here in some surprising runs of piano fills and exhortations), Mercer is stalking the heath of manhood's ruination. He turns over artifacts of Romanticism like an anthropologist on a dig, sketching out the landscape and puzzling over how these dick-swinging ancients survived. His yowls are the cry of somebody waking up from history with a hangover-- ""he was what the Poor call the Maimed,"" he sings-- as its dreams disperse over the horizon of legibility.</p><p>
    I don't mean to make Mercer sound like a nostalgist. His voice is
    nothing if not urgently present, struggling to pull his warring selves
    into some workable here and now. He invokes patriarchs just to dispose
    of them, from the ""Roman ambassador"" who is ""torn apart by plaster and
    reassembled after"" in the opener, ""Idle Songs,"" to the ""druken and
    besotted father figure"" who's pushed out to sea on an ice floe in ""Evil
    Energy, the Ill Twin of..."" They stand between Mercer and a longed-for
    future in which the masculine spirit somehow gets sane and whole.
    Meanwhile, touchingly, that bad dad out on the ice ""trembles and he
    trembles and he puts his heart on tremble.""</p><p>
    Mercer breaks from the crank-prophet line in that he wants to defeat his solipsism, to hack his way out of the thicket of male ghosts and build relationships-- with nature, lovers, family, his band and the listener. This album is peppered with references to himself as singer, from the epic second track ""Caravan Breakers, They Prey on the Weak and the Old"" (""I bet you are sick of hearing songs about the trail"") to the entrancing near-closer ""Bushels"", which assures ""there's a colony in song"" and ends on the simple statement, ""I was a singer and I sang in your home."" In between comes ""The Policy Merchant, the Silver Bay"", an acoustic, falsetto-sung ballad in which he teases, ""Mercer is a merchant, a policy merchant/ He calls himself urgent!/ He gathers all of the urchins up in their tearaways/ He gathers them into his palm and then he sings 'Another Day.'""</p><p>
    These wry acknowledgments feel especially gracious from a singer who is so under siege by sound and by the unending, unpredictable demands of all the voices of past and future birthing and dying in his gullet. But that's what Frog Eyes achieves here, not just in the songwriting but in the band's new dynamic range and precision-- for the first time, there's space in their hermetic universe for the rest of us. It's graduation day.</p></div>"|10167.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10167-tears-of-the-valedictorian/|8.5|Carl Wilson

    If you wanted to make an effective argument in favor of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's career, musical relativism would be the best place to start.  There's not much doubt, especially after listening to <em>Baby 81</em>, as to what BRMC does, nor could it be ignored that they do it particularly well. The band's four albums have overtly displayed their method: well-worn rock symbology adorned with modern flair and presented as variations on a common theme.</p><p>
    While BRMC's update of one of rock's most lingering yarns (itself never more than a performative construct) can at times feel like a well-executed recipe, it more often comes across as a cold, cynical ploy to revive rock's extended adolescence.  Past themes of rebellion, self-empowerment, and rock'n'roll salvation are in full force on their new album, and the mythology that started to pervade rock music after the Summer of Love-- especially the hippie blooze of T. Rex, the Rolling Stones' satanic majesty, and the equally-orchestrated rune-lore of Led Zeppelin-- remain the band's preeminent generic signposts.</p><p>
    On their first three records, BRMC's paint-by-numbers psych-blues approach resulted in some pretty good songs.  From their 2000 debut, ""Whatever Happened to My Rock 'N Roll"" had the branding power of an Apple ad, but it was fun nonetheless.  <em>Take Them On, On Your Own</em>'s ""Stop"" was a dude-ish <em>Slider</em> update, and <em>Howl</em>'s title track was an effectively whiny, densely engineered blues meditation.  There's nothing even remotely as enjoyable on <em>Baby 81</em>, however: The closest they come is the piano-driven ""Window"", which starts promisingly before spinning its wheels for six minutes, and first single ""Weapon of Choice"", which strangely feels like another band imitating the Club.</p><p>
    Most unfortunately, <em>Baby</em> furthers the band's ham-handed thematic extractions of evil from the everyday. Love is lethal, women are insidious, sin is everywhere, rock is redemption, you know the drill. For whatever reason, they still think it effective to use ""666"" in a song title, but without any hint of the theatrical appropriation of the beast-sign's former employers. Here, the number's ""conducer"" is some chick, the star of a ""Sympathy for the Devil""-type narrative complete with a ""how do you do"" play on words. The band's more recognizably annoying Harley-revving guitars underscore ""Took Out a Loan"", which uses an empty heart as collateral, ostensibly at the First Bank of Eternal Damnation, and ""Berlin"", a swaggering Bolan rip about a vague search for romantic redemption. The song's refrain expresses <em>Baby</em>'s leaden attempt at quasi-political macho vigor: ""Suicide's easy/ What happened to the revolution?""</p><p>
    On the band's MySpace page, Peter Hayes describes the type of empowerment the band strives for on <em>Baby 81</em>: ""Personal revolt. It's gotta start somewhere, and if it ain't on a personal level, it's too easy to beat the crap out of governments with words. Start with yourself and hopefully you get enough people doing it on their own and we can all come together."" With supposedly meaningful songs, however, bands don't get points just for trying, and BRMC's calculated notions of revolution and struggle are vague to the point of meaninglesness, with the clanky effect of a carefully-worded political stump speech. But the group soldiers on,  their main weapon a lack of self-awareness disguised as apathetic cool. Despite critics continuing to brazenly compare them to the Jesus and Mary Chain (it's the hairstyle, dudes), the truth is that BRMC is a big, dumb band who writes big, dumb songs, proven by <em>Baby</em>'s ""All You Do Is Talk"", which is separated  from the Fray by only a few melodramatic degrees.  There is nothing inherently bad about over-earnest rock clichés and thuddingly obvious arrangements, and there are quite a few bands who can pull it off very well.  But BRMC's problem is that they don't seem to recognize their superficiality and continue to make music with the pose-striking potency of a glossy Budweiser Music sign hanging in a college bar.

    be the next Nirvana, there was talk that Birmingham,
    Alabama, might be the next Seattle.
    Just like every other next Seattle
    prediction, it didn't come to pass. Verbena all but vanished, and
    prognosticators began looking elsewhere for new next Seattles:
    Williamsburg, Omaha,
    Montreal, somewhere in North
    Carolina. Even if it lost that buzz, Birmingham did
    manage to produce such solid acts as Azure Ray and its solo projects, Louis Schefano
    (of Regia and Louis), and 13ghosts, and the city continues to cultivate an
    indie scene centered around clubs like the Bottle Tree. Then there are those
    two ""American Idol"" winners... just
    kidding.</p><p>
    More recently, this hospitable environment has given us
    Through the Sparks, a group of childhood friends who pooled all their equipment
    into the makeshift Alamalibu Studios. Their first full-length, <em>Lazarus Beach</em>, follows their 2005 debut
    EP, <em>Coin Toss</em>-- both on local Skybucket
    Records. Like labelmates and fellow Birmingham
    natives 13ghosts, Through the Sparks favors a slightly ramshackle approach that
    incorporates disparate styles into a compelling clutter. <em>Lazarus</em><em> </em><em>Beach</em> is a sophisticated sprawl of
    sound and songs, with elements of power pop, 70s singer/songwriter, prog, indie
    guitar rock, and even some smooth southern soul.</p><p>
    The album opens strong with ""L. Roi"", on which Jody Nelson
    sings about a friend who committed suicide. As a deceptively chirpy six-note
    melody gently nudges the song along, Nelson sounds like he's struggling to
    maintain his composure, and just when it sounds like he might lose it, a
    saxophone comes in from nowhere, offers a few kind words, then ushers the song
    to its gentle finale, where Stax horns offer comfort. ""L. Roi"" derives its
    power from its subdued performance-- no ""Black Parade"" hysterics-- and serves
    as a fine introduction to the band.
    </p><p>
    Such is the gravity of that opener that everything
    afterwards feels a little frivolous by comparison, but at least Through the
    Sparks realize that personal loss doesn't make them unique. Instead, they look
    outward-- way, way outward. ""Mexico
    (Every Last Buffalo)"", one of many
    concept-driven songs on <em>Lazarus</em><em> </em><em>Beach</em>,
    considers American imperialism as wanderlust on a grand scale. Decorated with a
    hint of bossa nova organ and a nervously double-time guitar solo, the lyrical
    imagery sounds pat, its whimsy a little too forced: ""Please Dianetically
    explain this urge to roam,"" Nelson sings. ""In the name of Kennedy let's give
    the moon a mall."" But the slow-building momentum, culminating in Spoon-ish
    repetitions of ""shake shake it off/ For a second"" (the song's best moment and
    perhaps the album's), could excuse any sin.
    </p>
<p>
    Through the Sparks' eclecticism can be exciting as well as
    a little frustrating, as these songs indulge seemingly every idea that crossed
    the band members' brains. A short carnival interlude interrupts the otherwise
    tight ""Falling Out of Favor with the Neighbors"", drawing attention from
    Nelson's sh-boom-booms on the final chorus. Most of the album's second half
    sounds discursive and unfocused: The short ""segue"" tracks are intrusive when
    they actually register with your ear, while songs like the instrumental ""The
    Smile of Your Shadow"" and ""Only the Messenger"" sacrifice melody for murky
    atmosphere. Fortunately, these dubious experiments are redeemed by songs like
    ""Local Moon"", which channels a young Elvis Costello, and ""The Final If and
    When"" and ""A Natural Machine"", which end <em>Lazarus</em><em> </em><em>Beach</em> on a strong note. If digression
    is a local tendency-- and an admirable one at that-- then Through the Sparks
    are best when they're most disciplined, when their musical wanderlust doesn't
    take them <em>too</em> far off track.

    The voice and presence of Portland's Honey Owens has a lent a captivating accent to every group she's been involved with, whether it's the dub-inflected Nudge or the roots-centered improv of Jackie-O Motherfucker. For her latest project Valet, however, Owens proceeds alone, shaping her environment with spare, dreamy traces of voice, guitar, and free-spirit drones. On Valet's debut <em>Blood Is Clean</em>, Owens uses her solitude to maximum effect, crafting a singularly hypnotic album that is at once intimate yet deceptively expansive, her every spectral breath and note focused in an uneasy, almost supernatural isolation.</p><p>
    Then again, it could be said that perhaps Owens is not quite so alone here as she might first appear, as her stated intention for Valet's work is to operate as a medium, channeling sounds from an unknown realm. And there's no question that <em>Blood Is Clean</em> is charged with a disquieting, otherworldly energy-- even for listeners skeptical of Owens' spiritualist designs. In this regard, Valet bears favorable comparison to such free/drone contemporaries as Charalambides' Christina Carter or Fursaxa's Tara Burke. Yet Owens takes care never to allow any stray loosened spirits to crowd her out completely, and each of these eight pieces is composed and performed in a voice that is wholly and irretrievably her own.</p><p>
    To achieve her mystic sound, Owens utilizes a number of subtly variant techniques, but she recorded the bulk of this material in live single takes with few added overdubs. Aside from her distinctive, impressionistic vocals and guitar, many of her other source materials seem deliberately obscure, an ambiguity which contributes directly to the music's unsettling glow. On the opening invocation ""April 6"" she frames her wordless vocals against a shifting backdrop of submerged percussion and winds, granting the performance the clouded perception of some distant, half-remembered ritual. This effect is repeated on ""Mystic Flood"", which draws inspiration from Haitian Voodoo drumming to further its mysterious, almost subliminal pulse. 
    </p>
<p>
    Elsewhere, Owens reluctantly makes a few marginal concessions to more conventional song structure. On the spectacular title track, her molten psych-guitar figures emerge from beneath a dense, virtually motionless bass rumble while she sings ""My blood is clean but the devil's in me"" with a chilling detachment. ""Tame All the Lions"" works a lurching, bone-simple riff into a swirl of wall-rattling distortion, while the potent ""My Volcano"" echoes Loren Mazzacane Connors at his most desolate. Throughout these songs, Owens' vocals remain a familiar yet inscrutable element, her whispery-- and, yes, honeyed-- delivery as seductive as it is vaguely unnerving. 
    </p>
<p>
    As might be expected with music so spontaneously channeled, there are plenty of lulls on<em> Blood Is Clean</em> where apparently the spirits lacked anything fascinating to share. The album closes with ""North"", a 13-minute textured drone that, charming though it is, feels rather lackluster coming on the heels of the rest of the album's spirited, emotive display. These occasional lapses notwithstanding, <em>Blood Is Clean</em> shows Valet to be yet another fruitful project for Honey Owens, whose music evidently rings pure no matter what company she's keeping.

Two years later, and her latest offering of somber goo finds itself stuck in the middle of poignant scenes from a slightly more popular television drama, ""Grey's Anatomy"".  A recent episode actually utilized two tracks from <em>Lynn Teeter Flower</em>.  ""Clean Getaway"", featuring Taylor's frail croak and the sparse acoustic veneer listeners come to expect from her work, was a perfect fit for its associated scenes of antiseptic regret and recrimination.  The full-rock-band moves of ""Good Start"", on the other hand, clash with the poignant moments it was meant to soundtrack, just as Taylor's sad-sack ruminations on the track slap clumsily against the instrumentation that tries its best to coax some catchiness from the song's melody.  It's hard to keep toes tapping, though, when you sound like Eeyore's mother on an ether binge.</p><p>
    Suffice it to say that if you're a fan of Taylor's first album, then you're going to find similar stuff on <em>Flower</em>.  Whether she's giving the rhythm section a cigarette break, trying to approximate the sound of an anesthetized New Pornographers, or adding the same sort of pseudo-dancey Casio flourishes that have colored her work since the first Azure Ray album, Taylor never fails to instill the same sense of inescapable inertia throughout.  Unless you're drinking gallons of the street team Kool-Aid, repeated exposure will only make each subsequent listen even more of a chore, and whatever charms her music might possess get washed away.  A voice that might sound haunting or weary in a charming fashion at first quickly becomes a mewling sigh afraid of its own volume.  Her melodic knack is apparent, but there's only so much morose mid-tempo pop one can take, and it'll take a lot more than a fleeting dalliance with some Mellotrons to cover that up.  Once upon a time, this sort of bait-and-switch was accomplished thanks to her Azure Ray partner, Orenda Fink. As lugubrious as Taylor's music might seem at times, Fink's own 
    despondent dolorous haze made her partner in crime seem like a spastic 
    pixie.   Without Fink to play Sadder Cop to Taylor's own Sad Cop, the jig is most definitely up.</p><p>
    Given the alternative to the M.O. that's presented on this album, though, I'm all for Taylor turning her modest niche into a shallow grave.  ""Irish Goodbye"" presents a peppier version of Taylor's block-rocking beat manifesto, but it gets waylaid by an awful rap (indie style, of course) that would probably turn even the most ardent backpackers against the stuff.  If that's what this record could have been, then by all means, Maria, please trot out more deathly songs about clichéd devil dreams and self-recriminating passive-aggressive relationships (and feel free to close with some clip of a younger you singing the name of the album over and over in an awkward and winning fashion).  However, if given my druthers, I'd rather have an album full of songs like ""The Ballad of Sean Foley"", Taylor's collaboration with Saddle Creek sugar daddy Conor Oberst.  Though Oberst is officially given a co-writing credit, the song's word-per-minute rate, and its folky obsession with naming landmarks and cities, makes me think he should be given at least three-quarters credit.  His presence as a back-up singer also flatters the song, as well as Taylor's performance. Taylor doesn't necessarily snap out of the tortoise-like torpor she's painstakingly established throughout this album, but for a few minutes, you can see some light at the end of the tunnel, and imagine what it would sound like if she finally did.</p></div>"|10169.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10169-lynn-teeter-flower/|4.7|David Raposa

    In the early 1960s, James Brown was a hustler. As his nickname

    playing as many as five shows a day. Hustlers have to be flexible,

    Of the 20 singles (two unreleased at the time) whose A- and B-sides
    are collected on this volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only exercise in
    blessed completism, 13 were chart hits, and it's still easy not to
    have heard most of them, wedged as they are between the roaring soul
    of his early years and the funk he'd invent a few years later-- only
    ""Night Train"" appears on his <em>20 All-Time Greatest Hits</em>. Beyond that
    half-instrumental cover of a 1952 Jimmy Forrest r&amp;b hit, they include
    three 30s-era pop songs, one of them recorded with an orchestra and
    a choir; a raw, frantic ripoff of the Isley Brothers' ""Shout""; a trio
    of delicately balanced original ballads with Brown's voice slicing
    across their grain; covers of country hits by Kay Starr
    (faithful-ish) and Cowboy Copas (unrecognizable); a mashed-potatoes
    riff offhandedly overdubbed with JB yelping his tour itinerary; a 10-year-old R&amp;B tune that had recently been a hit for Gladys Knight,
    recast as an organ instrumental; and a two-part secularized version
    of the gospel tune ""Mary Don't You Weep"".</p><p>
    That's an enormous variety of stuff-- even more enormous, if you count
    B-sides and non-hits like the incredible rock'n'roll freakout ""I've
    Got Money"" and the scenery-chewing blues ""The Bells""-- and it also
    encompasses a lot of covers. (Some are unacknowledged, like the
    instrumental ""Night Flying"", a not-fooling-anybody variation on Bill
    Doggett's ""Honky Tonk"".) Brown's discography in these years was
    shaped by his ongoing tussles with King Records, which had moved him
    up from the less-promoted Federal imprint but encouraged him to cover
    songs from its publishing catalogue. By 1963, when <em>Live at the Apollo</em>
    was the hottest album in r&amp;b and Brown was selling out venues across
    the country, he was practically on strike against King, and they were
    pumping out whatever ballast happened to be in the archives.
    </p>
<p>
    Fortunately, most of the ballast was still pretty juicy. Brown's band
    in this period was one of his best: The rubber-band note-snaps of
    guitarist Les Buie, and the New Orleans second-line-inspired clatter
    of drummer Clayton Fillyau (or Fillyua; he's identified both ways in
    the extensive liner notes), gave the group its toughest attack yet.
    And Brown's voice was as monstrously strong and supple as
    it ever got. Mr. Dynamite hadn't figured out how he was going to
    change the world yet, but he knew he had to get everyone's attention
    first.

    Those inclined toward improvised music can usually find something worthwhile in all forms of it. But even the most blindly faithful recognize when a session shoots so high that it sounds more like a rocket than a record. <em>The First Original Silence</em> is that kind of instant attention-grabber. Original Silence use the same tools as many improv groups: rolling percussion, squawking horns, guitar feedback, and scraggly electronic noise. But these six sound-crushers have added some sort of performance-enhancing drug, injecting their sound with energy rare to any music, improvised or otherwise.</p><p>
    That shouldn't be a surprise given the pedigree of the participants. High-level improv is routine for sax player Mats Gustafsson and drummer Paal Nilssen-Love (both from free jazz dynamo the Thing), guitarist Terrie Ex of the Ex, bassist Massimo Pupillo of Zu, and guitarist Thurston Moore and Jim O'Rourke (on electronics here) of whatever it is they do. But improv history is littered with mediocre records made by well-heeled musicians unable to get out of each other's way.</p><p>
    Original Silence avoid such pitfalls by committing to improv-<em>rock</em>, the kind that actually sounds like experimental rock music rather than just rock musicians noodling. This is due mostly to the heavy gravitational force of Nilssen-Love and Pupillo, whose metallic rhythms swing between structure and freedom. The closest parallel to their bombastic stomp is the hammering lurch of Norwegian trio Noxagt; in fact, much of The First Original Silence sounds like Noxagt gone free-jazz, an enticing prospect to be sure.
    </p>
<p>
    Recorded during a 2005 tour of Italy, the album gets off to a ferocious start, grafting Minutemen-like bounce to Gustafsson's guttural horn playing. ""If Light Has No Age, Time Has No Shadow"" continues to hurtle forward from there, remaining insistent and vigorous through 15 minutes of tonal changes. Most impressive is how the musicians never step on each other; their fluid exchange of sonic positions almost feels conducted. When Pupillo backs down, Moore or Ex fills in with cutting string-work, only to slip underneath O'Rourke's squiggly slashes, which in turn make way for Gustafsson's full-body bellows.
    </p>
<p>
    The 45-minute closer ""In the Name of the Law"" is understandably not as high-speed. It does have stretches of mass hysteria, especially a crazed section starting around eight minutes in, where a nearly-4/4 beat, wailing guitar noise, and Gustafsson's Albert Ayler-esque squalls evoke the Stooges' ""L.A. Blues"". But even the most placid moments crackle. Stretches of electronic whirr, minimal guitar clang (reminiscent of <em>Evol</em>-era Sonic Youth), and thick atmosphere all emit an electric charge. Even the final 15 minutes, a nearly rhythm-less denouement, has enough plot points to keep you turning the sonic pages.
    </p>
<p>
    Long improv tracks have become such a cliché that they often seem doomed to fail. But Original Silence attacks these two epics like sprints instead of marathons, and<em> The First Original Silence</em> proves you don't have to stop playing to catch your breath.

    symphonic music, with clear beginnings, middles, and ends. Bands like Growing--
    who favor guitars and pedals and analog machines and leave a tail of patch
    cords dragging behind them as they move from town-to-town-- seem like they're
    always tinkering, listening to each other, and deciding in the moment what
    comes next. This analog-based live approach can lead, oddly enough, to heavy
    use of repetition. Sometimes Growing stay with a certain effect, holding it and
    letting it spin in place until they figure out where they're going to go next.</p><p>
    Such repetition is key to their latest album <em>Vision
    Swim</em>, as is the sense of in-the-moment discovery. Here Growing often seem
    like they're tending a sound garden more than composing. ""Morning
    Drive"" begins with a throb of acidic feedback drone that never lets up,
    giving the tune the 4/4 pulse of mid-tempo techno. And when guitar sounds
    gradually come in, they're unstable notes flying all over the place, circling
    and tearing off like flies trying to dodge the tail of an angry cow. Whether or
    not it was all planned out in advance, the track sounds like something created
    by listening as much as playing, as if bassist Kevin Doria and guitarist Joe
    Denardo didn't know themselves exactly where it was going and after eleven
    minutes just decided to wind it down. This looseness gives ""Morning
    Drive"" a nice sense of unpredictability, its emotional ambiguity and
    zig-zag direction helping to reinforce repeat plays.</p><p>
<em>Vision Swim </em>makes clear that Growing are at
    their best when their music has these frayed edges. The pure drone of 2004's<em>
    Soul of The Rainbow And The Harmony Of Light </em>on Kranky, for example, was
    solid but had nowhere near this amount of personality; a more restless music,
    away form the quest for the perfect harmonic sequence, is where Growing's
    strengths lie. Sometimes, as on the 15-minute ""On Anon"", the various
    guitar delays, crunching distortion and squiggly notes assemble into a
    torrent of sound that's loud and frightening with a molten core of beauty that
    even a kindergartener could appreciate. Here they approach the sublime tension
    perfected by Black Dice on ""Endless Happiness"", where they manage to
    be simultaneously both fuck-you obnoxious and warmly ingratiating.
    </p><p>
    Nothing else on <em>Vision Swim </em>quite approaches the
    knockout power of ""On Anon"" but all of it is at least pretty good.
    ""Emseepee"" also creates a bedrock bass rhythm off which playful bits
    of distortion pivot, ""Lightfoot"" turns white guitar noise into a wave
    pool, pushing forward with discrete surges of feedback. I haven't heard quite
    enough Growing to call this their best record, but it sounds to me like they're
    thinking hard about what goes where and why, finding new ways to get the most
    out of their varied sound palette.

The sampled instructor's voice on ""Air Waves (Intro)"" promises ""pure consciousness,"" but after the ensuing track full of simmering bass drone, all you get from ""Under Skin or By Name"" is a hammer to the face with ""HAWKWIND"" scratched somewhere on the wooden handle. White Hills have a few tricks up their sleeves, but even if they didn't, they manage to take the judicious wah-wah and space noises from Lemmy's old, infamous, severely underappreciated band without forgetting the role rhythm played in it.</p><p>
    Note how long it takes to get to the rock, though, and how quickly it recedes. By ""Under Skin or By Name"", it's apparent what the band wants to do, but it's only at the record's end where it puts together everything it <em>can</em> do. <em>Glitter Glamour Atrocity</em> is far more carefully and deliberately paced than any listener would assume from its scuzz-rock title and cover, and the moments of ambience and calm might just outnumber the stretches of full-on freak-out.</p><p>
    ""Air Waves"" isn't exactly spitting in your mouth, featuring a stiff,
    tasteful rhythm and an almost jangly guitar line; the tribal groove of
    ""Spirit of Exile""-- the album's most accessible moment-- simmers
    gorgeously without ever bubbling over. And, after four minutes of
    palette-cleansing hum with ""Distance"", comes an acoustic-led
    instrumental. It's almost an entirely different band that comes in with
    the brick-heavy psychedelia of ""Love Serve Remember"", but the
    transitions feel natural. It's during that track's politically dour death
    march (""never question these words I say"",
    they chant) where the band really begins to stretch out, as the guitars recede for a woman singing ghostly lullaby and a
    recorded-- and heavily edited-- speech from George W. Bush, devilishly
    rearranged to have him label himself a terrorist and a threat, showing
    more culpability in this re-constituted address than in his entire
    presidency. Then, a guitar solo.""
    </p><p>
    In fact, White Hills don't really let it all out until the near 14-minute closer and title track, when they finally throw everything they have at the wall-- the riffs, the solos, the pedals, the pre-recorded proselytizing-- and it sticks like projectile puke. <em>GGA</em> doesn't tease, necessarily, it's just overwhelmingly patient. It's a tribute to heroes, it's a modern twist, it has a current of political unrest, but above all that it knows when to hold back. This is an honest-to-god-album, with peaks and valleys, crests and chill-out sections-- hell, ""Glitter Glamour Atrocity"" alone has all that. You might take only one or two songs away at first blush (probably ""Spirit of Exile"" or the title track), but it's a consistently engaging listen from end to end.

    Panthers' career has been a case of two steps forward, one step back. The Brooklyn proto-punk band began their public life with <em>Are You Down??</em>, an album of polemical art-skronk so joyless, so overcooked, and so hell-bent on fingerbanging the boneheaded revolutionary specter of MC5 that it was essentially unlistenable. The album was plastered with more bumper-sticker rhetoric than a Whole Foods employee's Volvo, and while it most of it rang hollow, the bit about Panthers wanting to destroy art seemed on the money. If it were the only album they'd ever released, a sort of musical slash-and-burn, you'd have to give them credit for walking the walk.</p><p>
    But it wasn't, and Panthers 2.0 retraced their steps through rock history to figure out exactly where they'd lost the plot on the debut. The result of these bug patches was an EP called <em>Let's Get Serious</em>, and, well, it did and it didn't-- Panthers got serious about monster riffs and coherent song structures, but toned down the overbearing gravity of the lyrics. They were still throwing stones, but it suited them better in this hard-charging rock powerhouse than their former art-damaged glasshouse.</p><p>
<em>Things Are Strange</em>, like <em>Let's Get Serious</em>, found Panthers just as learned in the sweet science of riffology as in post-structuralism and Hegelian dialectics. Only problem was the trend toward tuneless, tensionless epics that reminded us in no uncertain terms that Panthers were a very <em>serious</em> band. Two steps forward, one step back. If Panthers stay together until 2050 or so, they might wind up becoming the greatest band in the world.
    </p>
<p>
    But this is 2007, and Panthers are still improving by gradual degrees. On their latest LP, they've made another vital step toward shedding their excesses-- quite literally. Where <em>Things are Strange</em> lost steam whenever it meandered away from its blistering grooves, <em>The Trick</em> sticks to the beaten path: Panthers saddle up bucking bronco riffs and ride the hell out of them for a minute or three, no detours. It's a rock <em>qua</em> rock record, with all the circular reasoning that entails: It rocks because it rocks; rocking is worth doing because rocking rocks; <em>ad infinitum</em>.
    </p>
<p>
    And like anything with a value defined mostly by tautology, it has the potential to seem tedious, even vacuous, to any but the truest believers. For all the raw power of <em>The Trick</em>'s riffs and the better-than-usual efficacy of Jayson Green's slightly aloof sneer, it's a slow starter. ""Goblin City"" promises excitement as its fuzz-bomb chords crash in over stony snares, but for an ostensive rave-up, it's a little <em>too</em> lean; a sizzling fuse that never quite explodes. ""Listen to Me"", with its cock-out guitar cascades and strangulated chorus, would be more sympathetic if Big Business wasn't doing the same thing, but with a sense of humor. The title track simply plods.
    </p>
<p>
    But about halfway through the album, a shift occurs-- Panthers abandon moody micro-epics and really start to cook. ""Long Time Coming"" sizzles; overdriven surf-guitar peals bend into a syncopated stomp with the muscle-bound percussion. ""Panther Moderns"" actually establishes some drama with its hazy distortion overture, drama that comes to fruition in the snarled guitar lead that leaps out with Green's confident vocal turn. And ""Uncertainly"" burns down and rebuilds thrillingly for two intense, time-lapsed minutes. Hopefully, on their next effort, Panthers will focus in tighter on the searing energy that they wear better than heavy atmosphere. If the current trend continues, they'll will, but they'll also do something else to undercut it. Guys, do not add that keytar!

Out there it's taken for granted that the houses will be drafty, the winters uniformly long, and that, on any given trip to the local supermarket, one might spot Thurston or Lou or Kim or J, on-and-off locals for more than twenty years. This is the quiet corner of the American indie elite, alive and well, where the long sleep between 1983 and 2007 feels more like a light daydream, and where the gap between a record then and a record now is no bigger than the label change from Homestead and SST to Geffen or Fat Possum.  Dinosaur Jr., Amherst's native sons, have no business releasing a record as eerily faithful to their own past as this one, but here it is, in all its low-key glory.</p><p>
    The nostalgia this thing exudes is hard to pin down.  Jess Harvell's generational <strong><a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/17020-dinosaur-youre-living-all-over-me-bug"">invocation</a></strong> in 2005 at the reissue of the three records the original Dinosaur lineup made in 1985, 1987, and 1988 is as good as any representation of the utter and complete solidarity and identification a certain enormous group of fans of Alternative Rock (read: everybody of music-listening age in the nineties) had-- <em>has--</em> with this band.  Just throw on anything from <em>Dinosaur</em> to <em>Without a Sound</em> and watch your elders go slack-jawed.  Imagine our surprise when we finally became old enough and realized that the battered weariness that was always there in their music and in J Mascis' ever-thinning voice was perfectly suited to actually being a little bit old.</p><p>
<em>Beyond</em>, the band's first record as the selfsame trio since 1988's <em>Bug</em>, benefits enormously-- more so even than fellow MA-veterans Mission of Burma or latter-day Sonic Youth-- from the years, experiences, successes, and disappointments elapsed between then and now.  It's been an eternity since the sludgy Jurassic ooze of their debut, <em>Dinosaur</em>, the light-bursting-through-trees melody of <em>You're Living All Over Me</em>, the clean lines of <em>Bug</em> and Mascis' subsequent solo expeditions, under his own name and that of his old band. But none of the three ever stopped making music, whether Lou (Sebadoh, Sentridoh, Folk Implosion, and solo), J (Witch, the Fog) or otherwise (Murph?). Their music aged naturally along with them.</p><p>
    Beneath <em>Beyond</em>'s crystalline production is the sublime result: years and years of weariness and aging and conflict put back into the bottle (with the same label no less-- the cover is as precise a rendering of that late-eighties SST aesthetic as anything from the actual era).  Less a theme park of the past and more of an actual trip there-- think Coney Island-- <em>Beyond</em> is nostalgic for everything but the band's own glory days. If anything, it's an exercise in making their entire twenty-year output sound contemporary again.</p><p>
    It's easy to spot parallels (""Crumble"" smacks of ""Repulsion"" to me; the guitar-work in ""Pick Me Up"" cribs vaguely from ""Feel the Pain"") but what struck me about <em>Beyond</em> is how little time I've spent thinking about any of their old songs since I got a copy.  And I can't be the only one whose blood-pressure went up a bit when the first single, ""Almost Ready"", dropped-- the obvious return of Murph, picking out on the snare all the melodic nuance of J's return-to-the-big-time riff, the sanded-down and low-pitched reverie of Mascis' voice, an almost platonic ideal of a Dinosaur Jr. song.  Add the follow up, ""Been There All The Time"", the crusading guitar line and signature self-doubt-- ""Can I be there all the time?""-- and the inevitable solo and the revelation dawns: they are the exact same band they were.
    </p><p>
    Lack of a certain kind of ambition has always been Dinosaur Jr.'s style, and songs like ""Crumble""-- which is built like and plays like every other slacker mope couch-song these guys have written-- reconstruct their ancient, ever-present atmosphere of escapism.  The two Lou Barlow songs, ""Back to Your Heart"" and ""Lightning Bulb"", are keystones here, as well as the latest ambiguous entries into a now-infinite history of hatred and reconciliation between the band's two songwriters-- ironically, both new songs are reminiscent of nothing so much as Mascis' solo work.  Mascis returns the favor on ""I Got Lost"", which is not recommended listening for moments of extreme emotional vulnerability, and on ""We're Not Alone"".  The false ending on that song halfway in, its tired collapse and tentative resurrection, is either a great metaphor or just a beautiful thing-- maybe both.</p><p>
    The lyrics aren't the primary focus here-- and they never were for these guys-- but it's hard to argue with the generic uplift of ""This Is All I Came to Do"" and ""Pick Me Up"", throwbacks to a certain era where we all sang along to songs made up of nothing but platitudes.  The record brings back the kind of push alt-rock would later turn into shove, a call to arms short of the usual pressgang.</p><p>
    Invert everything I just said and you get the critique: same-old things, one song seeping into another, tired nostalgia, nostalgic tiredness, ear-bleeding country-for-old-men.  But for all the ubiquity of Dinosaur then and now, I can't think of one band but Dinosaur Jr. able to do what they do.  If it's nothing special, perennially under-dogged and wasted, who doesn't want more of it?

(Honestly, you'd think we'd be onto the guy's shtick by now.) As with Tarantino's previous soundtracks, <em>Death Proof</em> skids across decades, countries, and cultures like Kurt Russell's <em>Grindhouse</em> deathmobile, taking in Italian B-movie soundtracks (the queasy ebbing and flowing flute and strings of Ennio Morricone's ""Paranoia Prima""), American pop-soul (the Coasters' noirish doowop ""Down in Mexico""), and British glam (the fuzzed-out boogie bop of T.Rex's ""Jeepster""). Taraninto treats his soundtracks like he treats his films, as if the invention of the VCR abolished the space-time continuum and suddenly all genres, decades, and countries existed at once within one parallel Hollywood universe.</p><p>
    But with Tarantino's pop song sound markers becoming iconic in their own right-- I'm pretty sick of seeing Michael Madsen hacking off that cop's ear every time I turn on the oldies station-- the guy obviously knows a thing or two about picking a memorable song to match a memorable image. Despite the years that separate them, most of <em>Death Proof</em>'s tunes do sound like they could have been plucked from three decades of double features at the drive-in, even if April March's ""Chick Habit"" really sounds like interstitial music from the <em>Powerpuff Girls</em>. Hell, Jack Nitzsche's ""The Last Race"" and Eddie Beram's ""Riot in Thunder Alley""-- a deliciously schlocky combo of fuzz bass, cheesy new-for-1967 sitar, and cod-Latin drumming that will have you instantly imagining teenage rabble cruising down two-lane blacktop to a middle-aged man's idea of rock'n'roll menace-- were already B-movie standards before being repurposed by Tarantino. And like all of Tarantino's soundtracks, <em>Death Proof</em> comes with dialogue from the film that wears itself out before the first play through, though thankfully these snippets are much easier to get rid of in the age of iPods than they were with the <em>Pulp Fiction</em> soundtrack. (Unless you were one of those people who actually figured out how to program a CD player.)</p><p>
    So Quentin once again collects a pretty killer clutch of semi-familiar and downright unknown pre-80s pop, rock, and soul; he probably made some awesome mixtapes for his friends before he was famous, too. But <em>Death Proof</em> raises the same old unfortunate parallel between Tarantino's big-budget exploitation flicks that quote the history of low-budget cinema and his major label soundtracks that repackage golden oldies and thrift-store obscurities now for iTunes. Tarantino spent $53 million and three years to recreate a B-movie era where directors were lucky to get $53,000 to crank out a whole flick over a three-day weekend. Likewise, you can spend $19.99 on <em>Death Proof</em> at Best Buy or dig up a .99 copy of that Joe Tex album at your local Salvation Army. It might sound even better on vinyl, in much the same way that the movies Tarantino pays homage to with <em>Grindhouse</em> are more fun when you catch them on late-night TV than they are when they're lovingly restored by the AFI and turned art-house respectable.</p></div>"|10156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10156-death-proof/|6.8|Jess Harvell

Ben + Vesper's jangly weave of guitar, accordion, organ, piano, and drums might be richer and bigger than their acoustic guitar-and-campfire predecessors, but these are songs for everyperson, tough, frank, and, miraculously, never the least bit precious.</p><p>
    Occasionally, Ben + Vesper's doting coos and warm freak-folk(ish) pop can prove reminiscent of other (equally whimsical) boy-girl outfits-- the Handsome Family and Ida, in particular-- but <em>All This Could Kill You</em> (which follows a seven-song EP, <em>More Questions</em>, released earlier this year) is boosted into distinction by Danielson/Danielson Famile mastermind Daniel Smith's rich, cuddly production: All 13 songs here are impeccably recorded, tender, balanced, and gorgeously organic. Smith's label, Sounds Familyre, is releasing the record, and elsewhere on the album, Smith's fingerprints are equally indelible: <em>All This</em> was recorded in Smith's studio (the New Jerusalem Recreation Room, deep in Smith and the Ben + Vesper's home state of New Jersey), and incorporates the contributions of plenty of Smith's pals and former collaborators, including Famile member Elin (also Smith's wife) on backing vocals, Famile member David (also Smith's brother) on drums, and longtime Famile accomplice Sufjan Stevens, who offers up banjo, recorder, piano, oboe, percussion, and backing vocals. Likewise, Ben's big brother and childhood friend-- Josh Stamper and Chris Weisman, respectively-- add arrangements and man various noisemakers, from guitar to marimba. All that friend-and-family closeness leads to songs that feel especially easy, which each musical piece slipping into simple, hand-holding harmony.</p><p>
    While the record's melodies are, for the most part, uniformly sweet and memorable, Ben's big, booming vocals (offset, naturally, by Vesper's breathy murmur) provide a welcome shot of weird: on opener ""Door to Door"", Ben bellows ""They will reach out and hold on to you/ Go on, introduce yourself or they will do it for you""-- and while he may be speaking about any number of benign things, the line turns more dark and sinister with each deep, baritone rumble, the kind of warning you're sure to heed. ""Rockaway Twp."" is a sharp acoustic/accordian throwdown (that half-sounds as if it could have been plucked from the new Vetiver record), a rare piece of beauty culled from a town better known for its strip malls (that ends, appropriately, with the caveat ""I wanna live in the country""). <em>All This Could Kill You</em> is packed with grim observations and impressive sonic flourishes-- enough to make you wish you had more talented friends.</p></div>"|10171.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10171-all-this-could-kill-you/|7.5|Amanda Petrusich

""I know all whales can sing"" is not the most profound opening line, but the quick, rough rhythm sets an appropriate tone for an album is chock-full of rhythmic lullabies that hint at folk standards, 1960s pop icons, and the topical colorings of indie rock.</p><p>
    The album's first single, ""The Sleepless"", makes a seamless transition from the opener. It curls around the ear with the soothing homemade guitar strums last heard on the Shout Out Louds' <em>Howl Howl Gaff Gaff</em>. A sweet, diffident electric guitar and a kick drum build the structure of the song around soft, simple flashes of pulse and silence. The melody is familiar chords in a hop-skip decent; the chorus is a metallic clash of ardent relationship analysis. ""Let's try it out now/ Breathe it in now/ And all we have is now."" It's certainly no bucket of cold water, as lyrics go, but Nick Delffs (also of Castanets) contemplates a fine balance, meandering between bliss and its opposite in a slice of pleasing, sunny rock.</p><p>
    The band lists its first two influences on MySpace as ""weather, the Beatles,"" and such candid sensitivity is completely obvious in its music. If the familiarity of ""We Will Rise"" approaches ubiquity, it's only because the Shaky Hands harness a sound that's been omnipresent for the past five years, permeating, if not always originating in, Portland and Seattle. The band's instrumental formula here combines minimal but clean fireside production with guitar, violin, the softest of percussion, and vocals that never overpower, instead relinquishing their grip to clarity of message. Sometimes that message is supposed to be unintelligible, emotive squirming, as on ""I'm Alive"". Foot taps make their entrance on this track, where Delffs quietly warbles for a long stretch of verse before another heavy, messy chorus makes its mark-- then the song is over. Such is the structure of the album, songs as short as pop songs, lackadaisically perky and energetically sulky.</p><p>
    ""Another World, Pt. 1"" appears halfway through the album, an interlude of feathery cymbals, lazy string pulls, and ponderous guitar strums: an indie orchestra tuning up. What bolsters the second half of the album is a more energetic turn to rock: Instead of splicing brief tracks with soft/hard alternations, ""Host Your Day"" has a more powerful bass line, a grating, minor-key guitar riff in one corner, a vigorous chorus that remains in the same creeping key, and ""la la la"" backup vocals. The pleasure of unaffected production means that ""Whirling Wind"" has a clean, organic, live flavor: guitar and vocals are coated in a hum of flutes and strings drawn out over the entire song. ""Hold It Up"", a doomsday, howling rush-through, hints at the built-up, near-anthemic structures of bands with bigger sounds. The material may not be breathtaking, but it's often invigorating, proving why this uncluttered, posture-free scene is more a scene than a fad.</p></div>"|10148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10148-the-shaky-hands/|6.9|Liz Colville

    On ""We're on the Road"", the song/skit that
    introduces his first live album, <em>Revenge!</em>, Robbie Fulks puts forth an
    outdated and ungenerous view of the long-running tension between artists and
    record labels. He stages a fictional cellphone call with Yep Roc prez Glenn
    Dicker, who informs Fulks that the label needs a new product from which to
    wring dirty filthy record-label lucre. It's a joke, of course-- and who knows?
    Dicker may even be in on it-- but not a very good one. Yep Roc in particular
    has never seemed in it for the money-- the label is home to seasoned cult
    artists like Robyn Hitchcock, John Doe, and Paul Weller as well as to future
    cult artists like Rock Plaza Central. Yep Roc even gave Fulks a home, and he's
    not exactly generating Arcade Fire-sized buzz anymore.</p><p>
    The label=bad, artist=good worldview, besides being a
    little too pat, peaked at approximately the same time as Fulks' brand of
    smart-ass, backwards-looking alt-country-- somewhere around 1998. Now, in 2007,
    there's a throwback quality to his throwback music: he was looking back to what
    he perceived as a better country-music era, and on <em>Revenge!</em> he's looking
    back to when that sort of nostalgia had more cultural weight and commercial
    potential than it does now. You'd almost expect to see swing dancing at his
    shows.</p><p>
    Equitably representing each of Fulks' albums and
    peppered with new songs and a few covers, the 2xCD <em>Revenge!</em> features an
    electric set on disc 1 and an acoustic set on disc 2. Electric is his more
    natural setting, not just because his backing band is better, but because the
    tone of that show compensates for his weak vocals. At its best, the first disc
    reveals the breadth and strength of Fulks' songwriting: ""You Shouldn't
    Have"" and ""Fixin' to Fall"" hew closely and sometimes cleverly to
    knee-slappin' country wordplay (example: ""Thanks a lot for wreckin' my
    heart... You shouldn't have""), and ""Mad at a Girl"" is unabashed
    power pop in the Rhett Miller vein. On the other hand, songs like ""Rock
    Bottom, Pop. 1"" and ""The Buck Starts Here"" seem too clever by half,
    riding a concept for a couple verses too long. 
    </p>
<p>
    Fulks comes across as a needy performer. Entering the
    stage to audience chants of ""Robbie! Robbie!"", he actually joins in
    with them, then later asks, ""Was that good enough?"", with just enough
    irony that it's not <em>too</em> transparent. Throughout the set, he shouts and
    cajoles his audience like he's Sam Kinison: ""Smoke 'em if ya got 'em,
    motherfucker!"" he screams by way of introducing ""Cigarette
    State"". His demeanor quickly becomes off-putting and creates a strange
    mood in the set, but all's forgotten when he strikes the first chords of the
    chugging ""Let's Kill Saturday Night"", the title track from his
    ill-fated 1998 major-label debut. More so than its studio counterpart, this
    live version sounds rocket-powered, as Fulks vents small-town, working-class
    disappointments that barely disguise his own career frustrations. For once the
    stakes sound dire. 
    </p>
<p>
    The acoustic set replaces that needy persona with a
    slyer, more self-impressed version of ""Robbie Fulks,"" one prone to
    in-joke exchanges with his band as well as tongue-in-cheek musical passages.
    It's as much a stand-up routine as a concert, which might be entertaining and
    personable with the right performer (see Tom Waits' <em>Nighthawks at the Diner</em>),
    but it severely leaches songs like ""In Bristol Town One Bright Day"",
    ""Bluebirds Are Singing for Me"", and an otherwise adequate cover
    of the Carter Family's ""Away Out on the Old Saint Sabbath"" of any
    gravity. It doesn't help that Fulks performs a silly,
    vocoder-assisted cover of Cher's ""Believe"" that's just a waste of
    time. Ironic covers of pop songs... how novel! 
    </p>
<p>
    Without the energy of the electric set, the acoustic
    set can only highlight Fulks' weaknesses as a performer. He may be a talented
    songwriter capable of witty wordplay and studied mimicry, but his pencil-thin
    voice sounds sarcastic and self-aware even when he's serious, to the extent
    that he almost always seems to be satirizing the old country music he professes
    to love. <em>Revenge!</em> suggests that he loves the applause and attention too
    much to surrender the stage or even rethink his approach. Maybe that's his own
    way of keeping it real, but is anyone asking him to sell out anymore?

    breakthrough album <em>Let It Die</em>, Leslie Feist claimed, ""It may be years until
    the day my dreams will match up with my pay."" Now, after countless sold-out
    shows across the world, close to half of a million records sold, and placement in a
    commercial for British bed manufacturers Silentnight,
    it seems safe to say this NPR darling's ""pay"" should be satisfactory.
    But, while Feist may now be able to afford the idyllic hideaway she pined for in
    ""Mushaboom"", the Calgary native still wouldn't be able to enjoy its creature
    comforts thanks to her hectic,
    frequent-flyer schedule. Alas: Faraway, so close. Brimming with heartbreak,
    solitude, and foggy memories, Feist's ""dreams"" still sound distant on
    <em>The Reminder</em>, the singer's outstanding third album.</p><p>
    Mostly written on the road, the new LP gets its inspiration
    from the disconnections of non-stop, intercontinental hotel-jumping. Talking
    about her ephemeral lifestyle in an interview with Pitchfork last year, Feist
    said, ""You just never set roots; you take pleasure in simple
    conversations, because you know you're not going to have much more than that.""
    Though she's trekked on her own and with bands including By Divine Right and
    Broken Social Scene for more than a decade, the 31-year-old songwriter sounds
    desperate for something more than ""simple conversation"" here.</p><p>
    Unlike the half-covers/half-original split of <em>Let It Die</em>,
    every song but one was at least co-written by Feist on<em> The Reminder</em>. (And her
    buzzing take on the traditional playground sing-along ""Sea Lion Woman"" makes it
    distinctively Feist-ian anyway.) Whereas her last album's smoothed-out eclecticism
    could be both daunting and empty, <em>The Reminder</em> is equally diverse yet more
    full-blooded. From the indie pop of ""I Feel It All"" to the creeping
    electro-ballad ""Honey Honey"", the album ambles effortlessly; its
    musical palette is wide enough to stave off repetition yet innate enough to
    offer an intense cohesiveness. The record's keen combination of off-the-cuff
    production and no-fat songwriting is likely linked to its method: With several
    songs whittled down over years of performances, Feist-- aided by her
    usual one-named conspirators Gonzales and Mocky, along with Jamie Lidell and
    others-- recorded them in less than a week in a manor
    outside Paris. Fleeting touches from horns, glockenspiels, makeshift choirs,
    and other subtle <em>accoutrements</em> never announce themselves ostentatiously.
    Instead, the LP relies on a modest refinement that breaks with current
    singer-songwriter trends  that promote infinite ambition in lieu of the
    basics-- melody, arrangement, feeling.
    </p><p>
    Hardly the first singer-songwriter to love, live, lose, and
    emote, Feist once again elevates herself above countless other diary-keeping tunesmiths
    with a voice that could make even Dick Cheney weep. Marked by specks of Dusty
    Springfield's soul, Björk's confrontational adventurousness, and Joni Mitchell's
    warmth, the singular allure of Feist's vocals is difficult to deny or
    overstate. You might hear her over cappuccino-machine hisses in Starbucks, but
    her direct-line moans easily cut through the biscotti muzak. And on <em>The
    Reminder</em>, her whisper-to-wail control-- exemplified by stark heart-tuggers
    ""The Water"" and ""Intuition""-- is even more striking than
    before.    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    ""With sadness so real that it populates the city and
    leaves you homeless again,"" coos Feist on ""The Park"", a
    desolate, lovelorn lament. The song-- with its references to a relationship torn
    by distance, omnipotent nature (a carefree bird can be heard mocking Feist's sadness in the background), and a hazy ""past"" that offers partly-forgotten flickers and flashes-- is a fitting summary of <em>The Reminder</em>'s wounded
    pleas. Leery of a sixth sense, the songstress concludes ""Intuition""
    with a question, ""Did I miss out on you?""-- its insolubility packing
    more ache than a hundred clear-cut break-up songs. Such eternally
    spotty ""what if?"" queries needn't always strike such dour chords. On the shaggy,
    Broken Social Scene-esque romp ""Past to Present"", the refrain (""There's
    so much past inside my present"") has the singer embracing yesteryear with a proud
    vitality. But no matter where she sits on love's teeter-totter-- down on the
    after-the-fact apology of ""I'm Sorry"" or aloft in heady infatuation
    on ""Brandy Alexander""-- her philosophy-of-self is sound.      
    </p>
<p>
    After inconclusively rifling though her personal
    history for 12 songs, Feist finally seems to reach an Emersonian transcendence
    on finale ""How My Heart Behaves"": ""I'm a stem now...fanning my
    yellow eye,"" she sings over wafting piano and harp. Though the song reads
    like a zen tutorial to her own unsettled emotions, it still finishes with a
    query: ""What grew and inside who?"" What she's referring to isn't exactly clear-- and that's the point. Pasts pass. People stay, go. But finding sanctuary within half-realized dreams and faces? Timeless.

Ono has obviously withstood mucho public flagellation, and every piece of writing about her seems sadly obliged to start off with a lame variation on ""hey, did you know Yoko Ono was also a conceptual art and art-rock and disco pioneer?"" as a preemptive strike against sexists, Beatles-partisans, and fans of conventional wisdom. Now that early 1980s dance music has been firmly established as part of the canon, Yoko's diva bonafides may even seem obvious to many casual listeners; in the club world, they were always obvious. In 2003, she even scored a No. 1 hit on <em>Billboard</em>'s dance chart with a ""Walking on Thin Ice"" remix EP.</p><p>
    ""Open Your Box"" is an Ono song from 1971-- before the disco era, back when she and John Lennon were still working out their Arthur Janov lessons-- that's also a new collection of Ono dancefloor remixes. The list of remixers-- Basement Jaxx, Danny Tenaglia, Superchumbo, Murk, DJ Dan, Felix Da Housecat-- looks like it was cut straight out of DJ chart from a mid- to late-90s issue of <em>Mixmag</em>, when someone like Tenaglia could play to thousands of people in even a second- or third-tier American city. Compared to today-- when imported German DJs spin imported German minimalism in the tiny sweatbox basement bars-- these remixes, with their old-school garage-y snares, and jeep booming basslines, project a kind of bigness that's been long-sidelined in hipper dance music circles. The expensive sounding deep house synth pads and tribal beats of <em>Open Your Box</em> scream 1996, a time when clubs came with multiple floors, aluminum walkways, and $10,000 lighting setups.</p><p>
    It's initially a weird fit with Ono's music-- especially if you're expecting something like the pensive, psychedelicized touches of ""Thin Ice""-- basically taking her out of a lineage that includes John Cage and Richard Maxfield and dropping her into one that includes Jocelyn Brown and CeCe Peniston. Sometimes, as with any good mercenary modern day remixer, these producers simply beef Ono's songs up for the dancefloor of their day, as with Felix Da Housecat's ""Tribute Mix"" of ""Walking on Thin Ice"", where he keeps the groaning, icebreaker bassline and the piano offbeat and adds louder ""Billie Jean"" drums and a strobing synth riff, like a modern day electro-house single has been plopped on top the 1980 original. Compare that with the Pet Shop Boys' ""Electro Mix"" of the same song, which has a beat straight out of a Stevie B freestyle single and the roaring, rusted chainsaw bassline that Vitalic favors when out for blood, with only the vocal remaining from the original. The PSB's ""Thin Ice"" has been beefed up all right, but for the dancefloor of 1986, not 2007.</p><p>
    Throughout <em>Open Your Box</em>, Ono's halting delivery makes her sound like world's first electroclash vocalist, and her vocal eccentricities save us from the godawfulness of an era when Hot Chip and Peter Bjorn and John are our new schmindie diva overlords. The ""our weekend in Ibiza"" synthesizers and off-brand arpeggiated bassline of Sapphirecut's remix of ""I Don't Know Why"" is nicely tweaked by Ono shouting ""you bastards!"" on the bridge, in a Mu-anticipating shriek-growl that sounds like she's been cornered in a prison knife fight. But in a blind taste test of several of these remixes you might not guess Ono was involved at all. Basement Jaxx processes her voice on ""Everyman Everywoman"" until she sounds just like Kele Le Roc over a snapping disco track full of their usual bells and whistles, and on Orange Factory's ""Down and Dirty"" remix of ""Yang Yang"", Ono is vocodered into a Troutman-esque gremlin and blurred into an anonymous orgasmic sigh over a brutally functional garage bounce. It's these tracks that make you realize the essential silliness of turning such an idiosyncratic vocalist into an interchangeable disco dolly, but on the other hand, as much as I'd like to hear what a fellow weirdo like Ricardo Villalobos might do to her work, hearing Ono over these bombastic butt-wigglers did make me happily nostalgic for 90s dance music, for which I was grateful. Little Louie Vega is not your enemy, and neither is Yoko Ono.</p></div>"|10162.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10162-open-your-box/|6.7|Jess Harvell

<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ghosts of Marumbey</span><span>
    starts on land: A doleful resonator guitar moans wide and long over a stoic acoustic. This could score
    a film on the American Heartland-- a wide camera
    lens panning over grasslands and closing in on a small town in
    Kansas or Oklahoma. The resonator slide eventually starts
    smiling moments after the acoustic guitar takes the lead and lift, its
    ascending scale lighting an optimistic skyline. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    But guitarists Mike Tamburo and Ken Camden offer this flash
    of innocence only to bury it immediately. Six minutes in, the floodgates swing
    open, and the drone that's been surfacing beneath turns bitter and greedy. Eventually, it swallows everything around it: <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Marumbey</span><span>, after
    all, feels cosmic, infinite even. This is a record of extreme empirical and emotional
    breadth, its beautiful highs (like the blissful guitar line of the opener,
    ""Two Doors from the Corner"") and its savage lows (like ""Beneath the River"",
    the suffocating, exhausting drone it segues into) offering enough space for
    dozens of interlaced travails. </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Such range is fitting, as Pittsburgh's Tamburo gathered
    sounds of 12 artists-- from as close as Louisville, Kentucky's Keenan Lawler to as
    distant as Honk Kong's Wilson Lee (aka Fathmount)-- after a lonely solo tour to form what he
    calls here the Universal Orchestra of Pituitary Knowledge. He improvised for
    hours with Lawler in Kentucky and sat in a Brooklyn loft with members
    of Bloody Panda while adding extreme low-end textures to one passage. Tamburo
    and Lee shipped unfinished files to one another with yousendit, while he and
    Brad Rose in Tulsa passed bits over Soulseek. When Tamburo finally set down to
    mix the album as one uncut piece last year, he was staring at 217 separate
    tracks collected piecemeal over seven months. A week of sleepless mixing later,
    he emerged with one of the year's most striking records, an impressively
    cohesive and demanding narrative through a lifetime of bright days and bad
    luck: If the wide-eyed guitars of ""Two Doors From the Corner"" are birth, for
    instance, then subsequent phases are maturation, near-death, deliverance,
    perseverance, curiosity, fear, death, and hopefully being remembered among the toils
    of the living.<span></span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    On every level, <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ghosts </span><span>is </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">not</span><span> your average avant
    album. While Tamburo certainly cultivates the spirit of John Fahey, Robbie
    Basho, and even Delta masters like Mississippi Fred McDowell, he employs his
    guitar technique only as an inlet into something much bigger than six strings.
    And while those remarkably saturated collagist drones that form the record's
    center bare the formidable influence of filmmakers Brion Gysin and Stan
    Brakhage and the intricate surround sounds of La Monte Young and Terry Riley, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: italic"">Ghosts</span><span> is too grounded and focused to be written off as an
    experiment alone.</span>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<span>The colossal roar of ""Beneath the River"" illustrates the
    panic slowly starting to sink in as drowning begins, just as the Kraut-like
    rhythmic repetition of ""Six Minutes After Breathing"" shows the curiosity-filled
    survivor tensing with reentry anxiety. Not coincidentally, the last two track's
    are the album's quietest: Centered around a church bell, a persistent violin
    drone and minor, glitchy electronics fighting for air, ""And Death Will Be No
    Resting (Tigers Walk in Circles Around Their Dead)"" signals a slow, resistant decline that's smeared across the
    first minute of the closing title track. That's when Tamburo returns to guitar,
    this time unaccompanied. His playing is nervous and unsettled, rapid series of
    notes and concomitant dissonance marking the mood of a troubled wanderer
    arriving somewhere new and cold. With a minute left, those notes hit their
    fever pitch, and it feels like Tamburo is strangling his guitar. Finally, he
    lets go, finds a chord, strums it hard and dodges it. Then resolution, now
    silence. It's likely that this album's hero is finally dead. But if this is
    hearing him drown, it should make you stronger.</span>

    First,
    a confession. I recall avoiding Robert Gomez's last album, 2005's <em>Etherville</em>,
    because it arrived emblazoned with a sticker proclaiming the presence of
    special guest Norah Jones. At least that's how I remember it. This wasn't
    because of any antipathy toward Jones, but simply because it felt like such a
    brazen display of opportunism, as if the presence of the jazz/pop darling (who
    apparently once dated Gomez's roommate) alone was enough to lure anyone to the
    disc. If Gomez was any good, I figured, he or his label wouldn't have resorted
    to such desperate attention-getting measures.</p><p>
    Needless
    to say, my decision was wholly unfair, and somewhere in the back of my mind I
    felt bad about it. No one gets to choose their fans, and besides, Jones seemed
    like a genuine supporter, showing up to watch the Texas-based Gomez and singing
    along to boot. So in a roundabout sense it was still Jones who made me give
    Robert Gomez another shot-- and by that I mean a first shot. And as so often
    happens when irrational thoughts and irrational expectations lead to irrational
    actions, a fair shake evinced the folly of my misplaced suspicions. It turns
    out Jones-- and more than a few others-- were onto something.</p><p>
    Astute
    readers might cite Norah Jones as misdirection, or at least a red herring,
    compared to the news that Denton, Texas, home of Centro-matic, Midlake, and
    others, has catapulted yet another would-be hero up from its ranks. <em>Brand
    New Towns</em>, Gomez's second rock album, also marks his debut for Simon
    Raymonde's Bella Union imprint, and as such stands to gain the songwriter a few
    new fans, at least among those predisposed to trust the ""cooler""
    taste of former Cocteau Twin (and Denton booster) Raymonde. 
    </p>
<p>
    Like
    Midlake, Gomez has an odd pedigree-- he had a stint in a circus and also
    studied Cuban music. Also like Midlake, those strange résumé builders have
    given way to a 1970s AOR fixation, specifically the smooth Fab Four-fixated pop
    of ELO, plus a bit of the Beatles' dark stuff, by way of Beatles-nut Elliott
    Smith, a looming, unavoidable influence. 
    </p>
<p>
    The
    lush and quietly quirky tracks that lead off <em>Brand New Towns</em>--
    ""Closer Still"" and ""All We Got""-- wouldn't be out of place
    on any of Smith's later albums, where his recording budgets caught up with his
    ambitions and he was better able to emulate the instrumentation and techniques
    of his idols. Gomez has Smith's double-tracked whispered vocals down, too,
    though he self-consciously camouflages them midrange in the mix. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""The
    Same Sad Song"", despite the title, is peppier stuff, as is ""Back to
    Me"", more Jeff Lynne in mood, melody, and approach. The album vacillates
    between those two styles, with Smith's ghost haunting ""Perfect""
    (""...without me,"" goes the downer lyrical kicker) and ""If I Could
    Have You Back"", while ""Mistress"" and ""You Need
    Somebody"" explore the sunnier, slightly more optimistic side of misery. 
    </p>
<p>
    There
    are no stinkers in the bunch, and a couple of stunners, but ultimately Gomez
    shows himself a better craftsman than songwriter. The tunes, quality or not,
    start to blend together, the pacing begins to drag, and the buried vocals
    disguise what may be the key contextual/conceptual glue holding the whole thing
    together. But <em>Brand New Towns</em> is still pretty impressive, even when it's
    not much more than simply pretty. With a lot of Texas singer/songwriter types
    still trying to be the brand new Townes, it's always welcome to hear someone
    with different ambitions. Granted, they're perhaps ambitions no less difficult
    to realize, but Gomez sounds up to the challenge.

    Joining Grandaddy slightly later than its
    founding members and leaving just before of their official 2006 disbandment,
    guitarist Jim Fairchild has embarked on a solo career that seems to profit from
    the slow-growing and modest realization of his own music. Many of the songs on <em>Ten
    Readings of A Warning</em> have existed for some time, but changes in
    Fairchild's career and the accumulated encouragement of well-known peers
    spurred the album's recording. It is a deeply ruminative and powerful
    collection whose homespun production is emboldened by Fairchild's transient
    West Coast ""studio""-- familiar or borrowed houses in cities like Los
    Angeles and Portland. He harnesses the best elements of collaboration, in which
    ex-Sleater-Kinney drummer Janet Weiss and Modest Mouse percussionist Joe
    Plummer, to name but two, respond to Fairchild's vision by contributing the
    backing drums to Fairchild's guitar, keyboard and vocals.</p><p>
    Fairchild had been plagued by the thought of becoming a singer until Isaac Brock and
    others played mascot. His vocals may not be striking, but they possess the
    clean, familiar tones of John Vanderslice and suit the wide-open sound of his
    songs. Even the plugging, lilting, but ultimately simple ""Killing
    Sheep"" is memorable, especially when spiced up with an electric guitar
    solo that remakes his vocal line with a grungy sound and grungier note pattern.
    The following ""Pile of Burning Leaves"" has a quiet narrative intro
    that develops into a punchy atmosphere of piano, slightly echoed drums, rangy
    guitar, and clear, loud, but controlled vocals. The clipped line ""Not
    having a baby"" pairs itself with the title as a macabre and evocative
    scene made more sentimental by its musical accompaniment.</p><p>
    ""Mouth in A Cloud of Smoke"" is the juicy
    center of the album, but lacks the shy, sweet elements of the opening tracks.
    Instead, it defies technology by sounding perfectly recorded despite its
    origins in a makeshift living room studio. Brian Deck, who has also worked with
    Modest Mouse and Iron and Wine, mixed the record, so perhaps that has something
    to do with it. Like the gutsier instrument showcases on Andrew Bird's latest,
    ""Smoke"" is stronger in number, dependent on thick, low piano thirds
    and seamlessly loud, almost liquefied electric guitars. When Fairchild's vocals
    join the melody, he's not overpowered, instead complementing the pomp with a
    human adamancy that lends meaning to all the noise. ""I Know It's
    Wrong"" follows it with a similarly chunky, resilient piano-guitar-drum
    fusion, but the composition has a little too much of a stronghold on its catchy
    melody and precise rhythm to really set itself in the mind, at least initially.</p><p>
    The album is sandwiched by cozy, effects-free instrumental atmospheres, its four
    central tracks (""The Velvetest Balloon"" and ""Love Leave""
    are two more standouts) being the most fun because of their anthemic, crowded,
    but ultimately neat-freak compositions. Fairchild plays with the same tools
    later, bringing a piercing keyboard cadenza into the middle of acoustic guitar
    ditty ""Backward Forward Through"". The songs benefit from these
    mood-altering featurettes, the keyboard being Fairchild's greatest help because
    of its versatility. But it's the guitar that he's known for, and when electrified
    and given center stage, the songs shine. As gritty bit parts on ""Sprinting
    Hyphens"" and ""Summer Stay"", the guitar is useful but doesn't
    always save the songs from the tepidity that ubiquitous acoustic guitars can be
    guilty of. His lyrics remain arcane and romantic until the end, creating a
    tapestry of what we can assume is an epoch of love in bliss, turmoil, and
    transience. Often addressed in second person, they are only coaxed into our
    consciousness by other moving, colorful ingredients, which spark songs that are
    digestible, addictive, and sometimes magnificent.

Amazingly, he also managed to make these records formal challenges to fixed ideas about culture and genre. And at the time, the Family Stone's seven albums-- now boxed in a purple paisley time capsule from Epic/Legacy (as well as available separately), complete with obligatory remastering job, new liner notes, plenty of period photos, and of course bonus tracks-- were released, his message (""we are family,"" essentially) couldn't have been needed more urgently. When the Family Stone released <em>Stand!</em> in 1969, images of lynching trees (Medgar Evers had taken a bullet only six years before, and Malcolm X two years after that), fire hoses turned on freedom marchers (Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy dead less than a year), and soldiers in flag-draped coffins (30,000 Americans killed in Southeast Asia by May 1969) were present tense for Sly, and for his audience. We also live in troubled times, to be sure, and it's perverse to compare body counts in very different wars. But a cynic might argue that we'd need to <em>have</em> a modern day leader like King or Kennedy before we would need someone to articulate their loss.</p><p>
    If no one thinks they can change the world anymore-- and personally, I think that's bullshit-- it's because our expectations have been turned to mush, until people my age are almost born suspicious and resigned. It's been 36 years since Sly released <em>There's a Riot Goin On</em>, his masterpiece, and that's a lot of time for cynicism to build up like a blood clot or a fat blockage. Television has led me to believe that when the Family Stone were new, folks actively believed they were gonna paint psychedelic flowers on the citadels of power, and it made Sly's fusion of rock and r&amp;b more than a post-modern exercise in mixing styles and his in-yer-face integrationist aesthetic vital to his audience in a way that's probably hard to take 100% seriously when you're experiencing ""the 60s"" through black-and-white photographs of marches and atrocities in 10th-grade history textbooks. And if you want a potted pop history of the changing musical and social mores of the 1960s, <em>The Collection</em> is better than 100 History Channel (or VH1) documentaries combined. Just look at the album covers and interior photos: On 1967's <em>A Whole New Thing</em>, despite the pink shirts of his bandmates, saxophonist Jerry Martini is still wearing a sensible brown blazer to go with his (eww) socks and sandals. By 69's <em>Stand!</em> he's dressed in something that seems to cross <em>The Sword in the Stone</em> with <em>Easy Rider</em>, even if he still kind of looks like Rip Torn has wandered into a production of <em>Hair</em>.</p><p>
    In 1965, DJ Sly Stone was spinning on San Francisco's KSOL when both the pop and R&amp;B charts were full of records like Junior Walker and the All-Star's grinding, horn-driven smash ""Shotgun"" and James Brown's epochal ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"", and when <em>Rubber Soul</em> and <em>Bringing It All Back Home Again</em> suddenly inflated rock's sense of self-esteem. Hired to produced many a San Fran hippie band before they had fully grown out their manes, Sly was eagerly sucking all of this new musical input up as his band-- both literally familial in the case of brother Freddie Stone and sister Rose, and also a mixed-race family in the ""brotherhood of man"" sense-- was gigging around town. Despite its title, the Family Stone's 1967 debut <em>A Whole New Thing</em> was a feverish but half-congealed fusion that's simultaneously the band's most straight-up rock (""I Cannot Make It"" is pure British invasion and the Saturday morning lysergic soul of ""Trip to Your Heart"" has the band playing like a dosed Banana Splits) and the most straight-up r&amp;b (the churchy, organ-driven ""Let Me Hear It From You"") album. The reissue includes two single takes and three unreleased tracks, including the jazzy, strutting ""Only One Way Out of This Mess"", which includes Sly's first sorta, kinda direct statement of purpose: ""Knock the corners off the squares/ We hate nothing and love the rest/ We're all divided into equal shares.""
    </p><p>
<em>A Whole New Thing</em> bounced off the charts. By 1968's <em>Dance to the Music</em>, Sly hit on perhaps his greatest idea (with a little nudging by Clive Davis, eyeballing the label's bottom line): Re-introducing his whole new thing-- Gregg Errico drumming a beat for even the least funky feet, Freddy Stone's bluesy guitar break, Larry Graham's thick-hipped fuzz bass, Sly's organ, and the huffing-and-puffing horn section-- with the punch and pop novelty appeal of a rock'n'roll dance instruction record. By the end, a lot of people realized that, hey, maybe this stuff <em>does</em> go together, and the song got to No. 8 on Billboard's pop chart. (The album fared less well.) The band, somewhat infamously and ironically, felt the capitulation to CBS's AM-radio aspirations made them squares, which shows what musicians know. The reissue includes two single takes (""Dance to the Music"" and ""Higher"") as well as three unreleased tracks and an instrumental. The best, ""Soul Clappin',"" is really just ""Dance to the Music"" in dub with new lyrics-- and way more hand clappin'.
    </p>
<p>
    1968's <em>Life</em> was another box office stiff, a fusion of raw <em>Nuggets</em> garage swagger with pop-friendly <em>Shindig!</em> dance band boogaloo. Freddy Stone is its star, ripping into raunchy, juiced psyche licks on ""Dynamite!"" His feedback groans like he's stabbing his amp with a knife, Link Wray-style. ""Plastic Tim"" quotes ""Eleanor Rigby"" before bursting into a slick electric blues backed with showbiz horns straight off the Vegas strip, and Errico's tightly clenched snare break on ""Love City"" reinserts the funk the band thought it had lost on ""Dance to the Music"".
    </p>
<p>
    By 1969's <em>Stand!</em>, worries about split differences and clashing genres had become irrelevant. The title track is gospel dressed in its Sunday's best that slips into a pair of bellbottoms in its final moments; ""Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey"" has the band skewering racial epithets over blues whacked out on fortified wah-wah; and ""I Want To Take You Higher"" is Sly parting the Red Sea at Woodstock, set to fire-spitting rock and testifying soul getting down like a long estranged couple having the craziest make up sex possible. And speaking of doing it: While you could almost imagine some virginal pop singer covering the winsome ""Somebody's Watching You"", Sly's 13-minute, acid-addled, guitar-soaked ""Sex Machine"" (no relation to James Brown's) suggests that shacking up with Sly Stone would result in blown minds as well as bedsprings. Containing its most radical music to date, <em>Stand!</em> was also the album that put the Family Stone over the top commercially, containing the haiku-brief (only 2:22) No. 1 smash ""Everyday People"".
    </p>
<p>
    Then spokesman-for-a-generation Sly cracked under a massive feeling of impotence about his inability to stop the abyssal reversals he saw on the political and social horizon, a mass Nixon-era capitulation that would be later papered over by glib ""have a nice decade"" smiley face bullshit . (Check out Greil Marcus' essential <em>Mystery Train</em> for the story of one of the most shocking aesthetic and moral flip-flops in pop history.) Even if you came to Sly's work completely ignorant of its history, a simple A/B comparison between <em>Stand!</em> and 1971's <em>There's a Riot Goin' On</em> would tell you that some horrible transformative event had occurred to turn his flamboyant and friendly music so frigid and frightened.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Riot</em>'s first line is solipsism as an ideal-- ""Feels so good inside myself/ Don't wanna move""-- and throughout, the lyrics tell you over and over that what optimism and effort will get you is a good kick in the teeth. The music was the rainbow colors of the earlier albums run together into a grey, sludgy mid-range where the flat-sounding bass was often mixed higher than anything else and the sound mix shifted in ways more Lee Perry than George Martin. Errico's stadium-sized human turnarounds are frequently replaced on <em>Riot</em> by a hissy and hollow drum machine, and Sly sings like he's pushing sewer slurry through his esophagus.
    </p>
<p>
    ""Stand"", Sly sang a year before. ""Don't you know that you are free/ Well, at least in your mind if you want to be."" On <em>Riot</em> Sly climbed inside his mind and found its solitude the only safe haven, to the point that he almost never ventured out again. What kind of freedom is that? Those of us who call <em>Riot</em> our favorite album might do well to take a moment to think about championing a record that intimates contact with humanity will give you cancer of the soul. But it's an ugly message that's surprisingly easy to take after nearly four decades of reduced horizons and guarded cynicism as guiding forces in pop culture.
    </p>
<p>
    Two years separated <em>Riot</em> from <em>Fresh</em>, and it probably felt like a shaky hand of reconciliation offered towards his fanbase. Now it sounds like a quiet-- quite often literally quiet-- masterpiece of reductionist funk, retaining the minimalism of <em>Riot</em>'s static-y pops for drums, its bubbles of bass, its flickers of wah-wah. With a wink at his own newfound resignation, Sly turned the Broadway-ready pop existentialism of ""Que Sera, Sera"" into something more suited to a New Orleans wake. His singing is less phlegmatic and growly than on <em>Riot</em>, which means it's friendlier, though he's still holding back, sliding into ululations that are sucked into gravelly moans. 1974's <em>Small Talk</em>, on the other hand, really does cross the line from minimalism to minimal ideas; lying in bed for the photoshoot probably didn't help deflect accusations of laziness. From there, Sly never really disappeared, Miles Davis or Brian Wilson style, but judging by the stooped, gnarled, beyond-sickly looking man that toddled out on stage at the Grammys a few years ago, it might have been healthier for him if he had, rather than stage successive comebacks into the mid-80s while drugging himself half to death.
    </p>
<p>
    Sly's decline-- none of the four albums the Family Stone made after <em>Small Talk</em> are included on <em>the Collection</em>, with good reason-- and oldies station over-exposure make it easy to take him for granted. Hell, it's equally easy to dismiss the 60s entirely as some model for progressive politics when you're watching commercials for baby boomer-themed internet destinations during ""American Idol."" But of course this is why high-voltage jolts like <em>The Collection</em> are necessary correctives for lazy cultural memories and jaded attitudes. And for music so tied to images of ""the 60s,"" <em>The Collection</em> still sounds, weirdly, right up to date, having been endlessly recast and recycled in the digital age. (Just for fun while listening, count how many times you think to yourself ""oh shit, that's where X sampled X from."" I stopped around 57.)
    </p>
<p>
    And socially, well, it's easy to find yourself agreeing with the ashen nihilism of <em>There's a Riot Goin' On</em> since it comes wedded to Sly's most fully realized music, but I do wonder how healthy it is to prefer it to his earlier work. I had been listening to <em>The Collection</em> for months when the Don Imus scandal broke, and initially, as I watched the abject, mortified faces of the Rutgers University women's basketball team, I thought about the way that <em>Riot</em> reneged on just about everything in life beyond breathing and eating, how it's
    become this totem for fans and critics who feel any attempt at social change is
    ultimately futile. But then I noticed how the mixed-race basketball team seemed almost confused by this unexpected flare up of old-school racism from a sad old man, something so many successive generations had been quietly working to erase. I realized that-- however he later trashed his own achievements, and however much rock critics prefer the album where he most soundly trashed them-- Sly's positive-but-never-corny early records had long since succeeded in making him one of the everyday people who helped to, however slowly and in whatever part, change the way we related to each other as Americans. Plus, you know, they've got a good beat and you can dance to them.

The first collaboration between Khaela Maricich (previously the only Blow member) and Jona Bechtolt (YACHT), they put it out in 2004 as the inaugural Pregnancy Series release, curated dually by Portland hometeamers States Rights Records and Slender Means Society, and had it reissued by K this year after commissioning remixes (from Lucky Dragons, Strategy, and Alan Fortarte of White Rainbow, among others) for most of the original tracks.</p><p>
    Those few who copped a copy at the time likely found it easy to recognize big pieces of it on the Blow's 2006 full-length <em>Paper Television</em>. Each record features tricky couples math, naturalism-as-sex-and-love metaphors, YACHT's propulsive synthwork and Maricich's pointedly broken syntax:  Maricich asked the boy on ""Hey Boy"" ""why you didn't call me?"" and told another lover ""You don't even believe in outer space/ Equal to the rate at which you doubt my crying face.""  Some dude asks her to put her heart in his hand and even though she knows he might hock it she can't keep it in her pocket, so, oh man.</p><p>
    The Blow beat accusations of exhibitionism and confessionalism the same way rappers do-- with specifics, and without being particularly sentimental.  Rock 'n' roll, de-abstracted.  When on ""The Sky Opened Wide Like the Tide"" she's wondering where her friends are tonight, her guesses are practical, a citywide Olympia, Wash., tour: ""Are they at the Reef?  Are they at Ben Moore's?  Are they at the Capitol Theater?""  By <em>Paper Television</em>, YACHT caught up, plundering commercial radio airwaves for regional rap crazes (snap music, hyphy, crunk, etc) and Timbalandesque gorgeous sound to put together the perfect palate for his partner's rapper sensibility.  <em>Poor Aim</em>, for Bechtolt, was a more mixed bag-- ""Hey Boy"" came from J-Kwon's ""Tipsy"", a Billboard #2 that year, but most of his other original tracks stuck hard to the indie-dance friendly sped-up rave that the Blow are now notable for barely using.</p><p>
    The hip-hopization of indie rock was (is) a long time coming.  By commissioning the six new remixes here, the Blow admit their songs aren't perfect, could be different, or better, and that they're open to new ideas.  It's a casual gesture, too-- no pretense of their art as island-- inviting friends and like-minded people to make new work from theirs.  The newly remixed <em>Poor Aim</em> is reminiscent of other Portland documents (the States Rights Records Bro Zone compilation comes to mind), on which artists feature other artists guest on and remix one another's work, bringing a mixtape mindset to an arena where work usually has to be singular and hermetically complete just to be taken seriously. On ""The Love That I Crave"", Maricich sings, ""I'm so tired of being wasted just chasing the same old thing/ I want to get hit by a big thing, come take me, change me,"" which is as good an explanation of why they bothered to remix all this stuff as any.
    </p><p>
    YACHT and Maricich both take the opportunity to do reworks of their own, one way they embrace the evolution of their group.  YACHT's ""Hock It"" remix loops the track's catchphrase to give it a chorus-- important for those commercial aspirations-- and also update it: give his track more heft, more G-funk, more quirk.  His new ""Hock It"" is less linear, more club-worthy. 
    Los Angeles-based Lucky Dragons aka Luke Fishbeck is the one non-Portland remixer.  But it was his sojourns in Portland and tours with Portland artists over the last four years that helped YACHT, E*Rock, Bobby Birdman, and co. create their DIY-laptop scene.  His Blow remixes are the smartest-- turning ""The Sky Opened Wide"" back into the gypsy ballad that it was before the electronics got to it, all wistful violin, guitar, and recorder; then taking the ""we're over here"" samples from that same song and making a new one of his own to close the record: pitch-shifting computer flutes; floating voices; samples cut in and out and scrambled, gently.</p><p>
    Strategy, a Portland-based remixer, LCDs-out ""The Love That I Crave"", glamming up the vocals and giving it a disco sheen, while Alan Fortarte takes ""Hey Boy"" to it's ""Tipsy""-limit, chopping up Maricich's ABCs.
    It'd be easy to say then that the upshot of <em>Poor Aim: Love Songs</em>, v. 2, is process-in-motion, or window-into-band-at-work, proof of evolution, etc but if that stuff exists here it's on the fringes.

    that of most bands' introductory work. Not to discredit their
    songwriting skills or adroit musicianship, but partially this is
    because, technically, this is their second record. They began as the
    mostly post-rocked, sometimes chamber-rocked and metallicized
    Tarantula A.D., who released an EP and the crazy eclectic <em>Book of Sand</em> album. Not sure why they changed their name-- the band still
    consists of the same three multi-instrumentalists who rock guitar,
    bass, sarod, cello, piano, organ, banjo, spoons, and drums among them--
    but hopefully it wasn't for disassociation of their past.</p><p>
    The primary fault with <em>Book of Sand</em> was a tendency
    to over-do the cutting-and-pasting of genres: sometimes you just
    wanted the haunting strings to stick around and totally
    encapsulate you before the Sabbathian sludge pulled your head back down
    into the mud, or vice versa. On <em>In Your Time</em>, this new
    revisioned creature seems to have digested their past, understood their
    strengths and weaknesses, and created a surprisingly refined album. 
    As Tarantula, vocals weren't around all that much but
    impressed when they were; as Priestbird, the devotional rites to hard rock are
    smartly the centerpiece, and the classical piano and
    strings are the elements that tie up the
    songs' endings and beginnings. Dynamic opener ""Life Not Lost"", for example, winds note-y stoner-rock
    riffage around Mark Lanegan-sounding whisper-singing before expanding
    into a brilliant collage of clanky percussion and spooky cellos. ""Hand That Draws"" begins with subdued
    atmospheric strings, breathy vocals, and gently plodding piano
    before bubbling and building into a Soundgarden-esque grunge-y chug.</p><p>
    The chamber parts are also given their own time to shine:
    Rather than, like with Tarantula, being awkwardly wedged into the
    mid-section of a portly rocker, some tracks such as the beautiful Erik
    Satie–like piano composition ""Guest Room"" or the piano-driven and
    string-accompanied ""Kliminz"" are allowed to flaunt their compositional prowess. Similarly
    ""Jackyl"" is an acoustic guitar finger-style tune channeling Jimmy
    Page's classical Indian/Bert Jansch braiding and revisiting Tarantula's
    folk flirtations. Besides the folky guitar bits, <em>Book of Sand</em> had
    guest vocal appearances from Devendra Banhart and CocoRosie's Sierra
    Casady, and the latter returns within the narcotic vapors of <em>In Your Time</em>'s very
    Beatles-esque-- specifically, ""Blue Jay Way""-- ""Last to Know"".</p><p>
    Much
    in the way that newer Queens of the Stone Age has expanded and deepened
    their Kyuss chaos into lysergic Zeppelin-y goodness, Priestbird have
    let their rock sink deep and the ornamental accessorize only where need
    be, but similarly with quite Zeppelin-like results: Take for example the
    album's best track, ""Season
    of the Sun"", which blends all of the bands elements perfectly: husky
    whispered vocals swirling around
    melancholic and subdued yet ominous and still-heavy
    guitars, with accentuating piano flourishes. It's very much in the vein of
    Unwound's swan song <em>Leaves Turn Inside You</em>. This gem
    alone is worth the price of admission, and I can't wait to see what strange
    and magical beast they transform into next time.</p></div>"|10135.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10135-in-your-time/|7.5|D. Shawn Bosler

So it makes odd sense that, while most improv groups release live recordings in long unedited tracks, No-Neck instead opted to trim their 70-minute set from the 2005 Victoriaville Festival into a nine-song, 45-minute album. More surprising is how they did the trimming. The group's open-ended music usually climbs and crests, but here we get short chunks cut off before they can grow, like clouds waiting for some elusive wind to push them forward. That may sound boring or frustrating on paper, but in reality it can be peculiarly hypnotic.</p><p>
    With most improv, the fascination lies in how unscripted sound forms compelling arcs. Here, the puzzler is how No-Neck can generate so much interesting noise without moving forward. There's no shortage of activity in the band's gurgling soundscape, so the stubborn ability to stand still is entrancing.
    The best example is ""Lady Vengeance"", which combines prickly guitar with creaky atmosphere and portentous piano, resulting in a paralyzed tension.  ""Dosed Cremant"" follows with brief noodlings chopped into aural haiku, and the dreamy ""Four Head Food"" is even more narrow. Rather than opening up its sound palette to any possible event, it focuses on a thin strip of mesmerizing sounds. Like many of these cuts, it works best on headphones, as microscopic tones become sharper when heard at close range.
    This tactic of isolating small vignettes doesn't always work. The hammering piano of ""Pylorus in Repose"" is tedious, and the goofy growls grafted onto ""Julius: Tainted by Ore"" are more off-putting than amusing (assuming they were meant to be funny).</p><p>
    Ultimately, No-Neck are still at their best when they let themselves breathe. ""The Cacao Grinder"" is an instant classic: electronic sketches, intermittent percussion, and clipped guitar slowly coalesce into a collective tribal groove. Sly musical figures that were present from the start become more vivid once a rhythmic outline is traced around them. ""Brain Soaked Hide"" pulls the same trick in a more rocking context, pushing female hums, loping bass, and wandering guitars toward a stoner-rock apex reminiscent of Bardo Pond or Hawkwind.  
    It would be wrong to expect a group as excitingly impulsive as No-Neck to stick to the proven forms those two tracks represent, and the rest of <em>Nine For Victor</em> is definitely an intriguing experiment. But knowing this band, it's probably the last of its kind anyway, and that may be for the best.</p></div>"|10142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10142-nine-for-victor/|7.1|Marc Masters

    Book of Bad Breaks</em>-- Thee More Shallows' third album-- is outstanding. The meat of the album is generally good, with strong vocals and decent songs,
    but there's enough gristle on this record that it ultimately obscures some of
    the pleasures of listening to it. On their previous (and best) album, 2005's <em>More Deep Cuts</em>, Thee More Shallows seemed headed
    toward a sort of Flaming Lips-inspired audio playground; they're still
    messing with sound, but this time the experimentation is more
    noise-oriented, and that unfortunately means some tracks are slathered with messy,
    unflattering sounds and distortion.</p><p>
    The best songs harness the noisiness and transcend it, while
    others are simply hobbled by it. ""Oh Yes, Another Mother"" falls into the former
    camp, whipping along on a killer drum beat that boils to a frenzy as the song
    reaches its peak. The song is led off by a separately sequenced intro track
    consisting of a small string arrangement and some hints of percussion. Dee
    Kesler's high yet full vocals are underpinned by an ever-growing drone that
    threatens to overtake it after the second verse, but recedes for the quiet
    coda.</p><p>
    The noise is likewise sculpted and tightly controlled on
    ""Night at the Knight School"", which gets beyond its somewhat gimmicky title
    with lyrics that could apply to just about anyone in college-- the
    song's character is focusing on the pain of a toothache to stay awake and finish his work
    amidst a host of distractions. Buzzing guitars and keyboards are manhandled
    into melodic shapes to create secondary hooks. The song that follows, ""Proud
    Turkeys"", is perhaps the most confounding thing on the record. Brief strings
    are swallowed by a flat-out ugly guitar part and thrashing drums, and the first
    stab at a verse is a disorganized, tentative build-up to the non-sequitur line
    ""proud turkeys with the gift of flight."" It recovers from the sloppiness as it
    goes on but never really becomes much of a song, instead settling for an atmospheric
    violin coda.
    </p><p>
    Listening to the record as a whole is a strangely dividing
    experience-- on the one hand, it's impressive that so many of the songs are
    strong enough to overcome the over-saturation in the production. But on the
    other, it's a shame they couldn't just let these songs simply flower on
    their own without a big fuzzy weight tied to them. Because of the way it's
    recorded, <em>The Book of Bad Breaks</em> is a
    record that takes a bit of time to work your way into, but some of what sounds
    merely noisy on an early listen reveals itself as more detailed and nuanced
    once you get to know it.

Appropriately, <em>Woke on a Whaleheart</em>, Callahan's first release under his birth name, is also his least explicitly experimental. Anchored by Callahan's deep, loping pipes and rich string arrangements courtesy of Royal Trux's Neil Michael Hagerty (who also co-produced), the album is a relatively straightforward collage of country, folk, and classic Austin indie. <br/></p><p>
    Callahan may finally be stepping into his own name, but in both narrative and sound, <em>Woke on a Whaleheart</em> is insistently vague, riddled with half-thoughts and muddled images. Accordingly, opener ""From the River to the Ocean"" flatly implores us to ""have faith in wordless knowledge""-- to submit to the nebulous truth inherent to all big things (see: love, nature, and death). <em>Whaleheart</em>'s instrumentation follows suit, meandering and slack, with bits of piano and percussion, twisty guitars, and itinerant melodies. Imprecision is hardly the backbone of great art, but it's still strangely easy to be seduced by Callahan's cloud, and if you can learn how to listen to his loose, flowing stories without scouring the sky for a payoff, there are plenty of bits to enjoy here.</p><p>
    Lyrically, themes range from banal (in ""A Man Needs a Woman or a Man to be a Man"", Callahan finds his rose-addled bedroom kinda girly, declaring ""It's pretty womanly in here!"") to metaphysical (in single ""Diamond Dancer"", a girl dances herself into a diamond, ""doing the thing as she dreamed it."") The jangly, sweet-faced ""Sycamore"" finds Callahan crowing hard about
    the cycle of life over tinny guitar and light drums: ""He taught me to
    love in the wild and fight in a gym/ He taught me the bottle gives
    birth to the cup/ And you won't get hurt if you just keep your hands
    up/ And stand tall/ Like Sycamore.""
    </p><p>
    Callahan's voice, meanwhile, is thick and precise, tempered only by the smallest hints of grit-- on ""The Wheel"" he channels Outlaw composure, sounding like a cross between Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings with all his round sounds and bellows. The track even features gospel-singer back-up (provided by the lovely Deani Pugh-Flemmings) and vaguely biblical spoken proclamations (""The wheel has turned one full circle/ Time for my meal of wood"").  
    </p>
<p>
<em>Woke on a Whaleheart</em> is a deceptively easy listen-- steady, lulling, and vehemently organic-- but consequently, it can begin to feel invisible. Sound fades into sound, until silence is noise. Still, it's hardly facile: Violinist Elizabeth Warren and guitarist Pete Denton make sparks, and various other players dip in and out, offering Wurlitzer, found sounds, Farfisa, lap steel, glockenspiel, and Hammond organ. Callahan may have ditched the instrumental, uber lo-fi methodology of his earliest days, but <em>Woke on a Whaleheart</em> is still a fully realized event, if not necessarily a game-changing one.

    It's possible to listen to and discuss this album
    by married couple Avey Tare (real name: David Portner; main gig: Animal
    Collective) and Kria Brekkan (aka Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir, formerly of Múm,
    lots of guest appearances since) on a conceptual plane. As has been widely
    disseminated in the online community, <em>Pullhair Rubeye</em> was essentially
    complete last December when, prompted in part by a viewing of director David Lynch's <em>Inland Empire</em>, Portner and Valtýsdóttir decided to
    reverse the tapes and release the album with all the songs running backward.</p><p>
    There's plenty of experimental music out there-- long drones, say-- where such
    a move might have gone unnoticed; this isn't one of them. The original tapes
    consisted of earthy, folky songs of simple construction consisting of mostly
    acoustic guitar, piano, and voice. 
    Some potentially interesting questions crop up. Portner and Valtýsdóttir
    knew lots of people would re-reverse the record to hear its source; indeed,
    plenty of computer-savvy fans have already ""fixed"" <em>Pullhair
    Rubeye</em>, and-- what do you know-- in its original form, it's a damn nice
    album.</p><p>
     Though Portner and Valtýsdóttir's main projects have little in common, here they are
    aesthetically simpatico. Relative to the dark material Portner released on his
    half of a 2003 split EP, these tracks show him with an interest in singsong melody
    and childlike simplicity as pronounced as that of his partner-in-crime Panda
    Bear. And while I am no fan of Valtýsdóttir's infantilized coo of a voice, I
    like it in this context better than anywhere outside the first Múm record. So I
    highly recommend that Animal Collective fans seek out the re-reversed copies of
    <em>Pullhair Rubeye</em>. They are enjoyable. And the computer-savvy downloaders helped make them.</p><p>
    Another point of interest: there is something compelling about how
    ""acoustic"" music can become ""electronic"" merely by running
    the tape backward. In their original form, these are ""songs;""
    reversed, if they are going to be appreciated at all, these ""songs""
    are heard as ""ambient pieces."" So yeah, conceptually, <em>Pullhair
    Rubeye</em> might have something on the ball, and I'm always a fan of playful gestures.
    But then there's, you know, the thing that sits on store shelves and costs
    money. And that version of <em>Pullhair Rubeye</em> is remarkably dull. 
    </p>
<p>
    For me
    personally, the irony is that I've long considered myself the biggest sucker
    ever born for the simple backward effect. In reviews I've praised passages for
    their ""disorientation"" and ""peculiar sense of longing"" that
    were no more than a couple of notes tapped out on a piano and flipped over in
    Pro Tools. I admit it; it's easy to pull off, but backward instruments can still
    get to me. Probably all that time as a kid spent listening for Satanic
    back-masking when I should have been outside playing kick the can (or maybe it was those Beatles records).</p><p>
    A whole
    album of this one effect, however, the reverse piano and reverse guitar and
    reverse voices going from decay to attack over and over and over again for 31
    minutes... man, it's not just boring, it actually becomes depressing. It all
    kind of bleeds together into one bland and undifferentiated sonic blob that I never need to hear again.  
    That's one nice thing about living when we do, though: Unlike Lou Reed fans
    with <em>Metal Machine Music</em> or Flaming Lips fans with <em>Zaireeka</em>, no
    one is going to pick this up on a whim without knowing what they're getting
    into. The information is out there. Everyone who knows and cares about the
    Animal Collective, everyone who follows the doings of Kristín Anna
    Valtýsdóttir, all these folks also spend time online and so know <em>Pullhair
    Rubeye</em>'s story. So it's not a rip-off, at least, we have to give them that.
    It's also no fun whatsoever to listen to.

In the age of James Murphy and Girl Talk, even the most trifling mid-album house track better have some Krautrock or Lee Perry allusions if it's going to catch anyone's attention. I don't mean to sound overly critical, since this is hardly a new occurrence. Juan Atkins and Derrick May were spraying Funkadelic all over ""Radio-Activity"" back in 1986 and Larry Levan laced Jamaican dub with powdery disco at a time when both genres barely even existed. But my contention here is merely that the most prominent DJs and splicers are increasingly satisfied to sacrifice any sustained sense of mood for the sort of obligatory thrills of, say, binding Blondie to Nurse With Wound. Which is precisely how Optimo ended their most famous album, the terrifically silly <em>How to Kill the DJ, Part II</em>.</p><p>
    Optimo is JD Twitch and JG Wilkes, two peerless DJs at Glasgow's Sub Club who have spent the past decade mixing the most fashionable concoctions of post-punk, techno, and funk into everlasting bouts of grinding pop psychosis. Their names became household with 2004's double-disc <em>Kill the DJ II</em>, which gnashed through the most guttural beats of everything from Laibach to Carl Craig. It was arguably the best mix album of that year, but it spent half its time crawling out from the trenches it kept digging itself into. In the eternal battle between novelty and momentum, <em>Kill the DJ II</em> tended to side with the former. After this epic anthology of drooling hipster name-dropping, 2005's <em>Psyche Out</em> was a genuinely enjoyable jolt of dance purity that managed to segue in a couple prog songs without losing any velocity. <em>Walkabout</em> completes that trend. It's uncompromising and unadulterated and consists entirely of pure synthetic electricity. There's still a tremendous amount of diversity here-- hell, the title cut's from Throbbing Gristle's <em>20 Jazz Funk Greats</em>-- but it's all in the service of the same pulsing circuits of rhythm that act as Optimo's neo-acid foundation.</p><p>
    Beyond the sheer consistency, the new album seems even more deeply affiliated with Eno, the Detroit scene, and Basic Channel. It may as well be a European Union symposium on house, from the most moronic Glastonbury tent to the dankest Cologne dub basement. It courses through British industrialism, German minimalism, Scandinavian sound sculpture, and Dutch slapstick without ever missing a mark. With the exception of Boris' benzo-blasted psych-coma (""My Machine"" off <em>Pink</em>), <em>Walkabout</em> unloads glowing synth circuitry and metallic meltdowns like an hour-and-a-half evacuation's going on at the club. Throbbing Gristle's cloying twitters are swallowed whole by Grungerman's industrial grab-bag of warehouse rave: factory alarms, stomping feet, chiming glass, and the faint hum of house music from a distant building. Pan Sonic fumbles around, enveloped by burnished electronics and trodden by some delightfully tacky Latin settings off a Casio. Who cares whether Databrain's ""Electrofrogs"" exhibits the slightest trace of originality? It's impossible to impugn heaps of handclaps and hi-hats piled under hulking resonators.</p><p>
    Undeniably, the most impressive portion is the middle, where Philus spins cell-phone tones into gorged pop and Shane Berry alchemically converts spitting into doo-wop amidst razor-carved reels. Even the least memorable track here, Godsy's ambient ""The Grass Runs Red"", is covered in the ecstatic noise of dribbled static and foam. And, as a testament to the producers' prowess, one should note that the best moments are in the transitions, not in the songs themselves. Witness the tipping point between Lenny Dee &amp; Nicolai Vorkapich's ""The Virus"" and Philus' ""Kuvio 3"". It's like an Apollo mission heard through a rusty screen door, or like a laserium with construction defects. The sheer depth and <em>volume</em> of the tracks are immediately perceptible to even the laziest listener.</p><p>
    Lest I appear overzealous, it would only be fair to note that <em>Walkabout</em> isn't inventing the wheel here. There's nothing distinctive enough to leave indelible imprints upon the history of dance mixes, and there isn't anything so spellbindingly creative it demolishes the very scaffolds of electronic music. While I'm glad Optimo have loosened the mash-up mentality's grip on their otherwise accomplished albums, they've yet to release anything propulsive enough to leave listeners in a permanent state of withered euphoria. Better to say Optimo have come one step closer to perfecting their deadly stockpile of broiling rave and retro homage.</p></div>"|10138.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10138-walkabout/|7.9|Alex Lindhart

    recognizable and quickly absorbed, there are still bands, albums, and catalogs
    that just take more time. Their value only reveals itself with patience: the
    hooks are obtuse, the choruses demure, and the memorable details deep in the
    strata of the mix, only discerned with headphones on the fifth or sixth or
    twentieth listen. Not every note brings instant gratification, and not every
    melody is a quick fix. 
    Part Chimp is not one of these hard-to-grasp artists. What's the inverse of
    a velvet hammer-- a massage from a horny gorilla? A tickle with a scythe blade?
    They've got it down: this UK band strikes a rare balance between oppressive
    guitar sludge, questionable recording fidelity, and brazenly stupid hooks. They
    even marshaled some the squalls of noise from post-rock's heavier acts-- being
    Mogwai protégés helps-- on their sophomore album, 2005's <em>I Am Come</em>.<em> Cup</em>
    has neither the steel-toe kick in the sweet tooth of their debut, Chart Pimp,
    or the cohesiveness of <em>Come</em>, but to expect either from an odds-and-sods
    comp would be silly.</p><p>
    That Part Chimp have yet to conquer America is criminal
    and unfair; <em>Cup</em> may not be the greatest starting point, but then, any
    first exposure to Part Chimp is the best exposure. Start here or start
    anywhere, just open your goddamn ears already. 
    For the already-converted American fans who didn't pick up the excellent
    ""New Cross"" single as the band last toured through the States, Cup
    combines that track with alternate takes and obscure sides that even
    file-sharers would have trouble finding, making it a welcome compendium. The reckless
    tempo belies the patient build in tension on the single version of ""Bring
    Back the Sound"", which trots out far ahead of the jet-engine distortion of
    ""Crash the High Octave"", or the monotonous crunch of
    ""Seedsy"" or its heavier but hard-to-distinguish cousin, ""Miser
    Chimp"", tunes which are (relatively) less subtle while still making the
    band's irresponsible-yet-accessible appeal plain. 
    The simple climb of ""30,000,000,000 People,"" an earlier version of
    an <em>I Am Come</em> highlight, sounds monolithic and unrelenting here, but the
    following ""New Cross"" and it's accompanying B-sides are this disc's
    linchpin.</p><p>
    ""New Cross"" is slicker, scarier, and more metal than
    anything in their catalog, but with punk-worthy pummeling of the toms and
    bickering twin guitar lines adding to its rubbery low-end melody. While the
    bluesier strut of ""Black Water"" is more obvious, it's no less
    gratifying. The real curveball is ""And Hell is Behind Me"", ten
    minutes of knuckle-dragging rhythm with no trace of melody-- just echoing
    dive-bomb guitar scrapes, answering machine messages, and mercurial, piercing
    feedback. 
    Taken from a four-way split single, the suspenseful drum performance and dry
    guitar tone of ""Once More Forever"" make for a gripping left-turn in
    the band's material. ""Wild Honey Pie"" is less essential; whether it's a
    tribute to the Pixies' inspired deconstruction of the song or just an
    opportunity to confuse, it's simply a fun and irreverent throwaway.</p><p>
    It's hard
    to predict from these old non-album sides where the band's next album will take
    them, but given the deadly concise ""New Cross"" sharing space with the
    lumbering and discordant ""And Hell is Behind Me"", their upcoming
    material could go anywhere. This compilation buys you some time to scramble for
    their two LPs and say you were there first before Part Chimp brought a dazed
    and deafened world to its knees.</p></div>"|10144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10144-cup/|7.4|Jason Crock

    Consider the branch of post-rock that was more or
    less introduced by Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Mogwai in the late 1990s, and
    is now practiced by Explosions in the Sky, Mono, and others. This music focuses on songs with slow, spare
    beginnings that steadily climb to huge crescendos bursting at the seems with
    guitar strums and, often, violin swells. It's easy to
    forget just how powerful this stuff sounded on first exposure. All of a sudden
    the direct and emotionally charged communication of film soundtracks was
    available from instrumental rock bands. And live, man, with the loud climaxes
    even louder, it was something to behold.</p><p>
    Still, something strange has happened with this sort of music since. It's
    almost as if the sense of structure laid out in the late 90s proved to be so
    winning, bands grew afraid to mess with it. Some do what they can to branch
    out, such as Mogwai, who on record moved on to other things long ago. But it's
    strange how predictable this music, which depends partly on surprise for those
    big moments to resonate, has become.</p><p>
    You could almost compare it to 12-bar blues, where after the second
    repetition of the first couplet you can feel in your body which chord is coming
    next; when bands of this ilk stick to the quintessence-- which is most of the
    time-- you can anticipate every modulation of sound well before it arrives.
    Here on their debut record, England's Yndi Halda adhere closely to the
    ""classic"" form of this kind of post-rock. Over four tracks that
    average about 15 minutes per, they milk the formula for everything it's worth.
    </p>
<p>
    How much is left to milk, and exactly what it's worth at this point, will
    vary a lot from listener to listener. Suffice to say Yndi Halda generally do this
    thing pretty well. The production is nice, the crescendos crash, the strings
    and guitar distortion are impressively loud. It's a well-established form, and
    they hit their marks. They even add a new wrinkle in the form of wordless
    vocals that crop up here and there, most notably on the last section of the
    17-minute ""Dash and Blast"". Hearing the mass of voices belting out
    ""Dah-da-dah-du-dah"" in time with the guitar melody sounds a bit
    cheesy when it first hits, but then begins to sound pretty great, in part <em>because</em>
    it sounds a bit cheesy. The voices are a tad clumsy but in a charming way,
    which, after all the by-the-book moves in a form that takes itself so
    seriously, is welcome.
    </p>
    Still,
    the changes from bar to bar on <em>Enjoy Eternal Bliss </em>are so telegraphed, it's
    hard to get excited, especially if you've heard a good bit of this kind of
    thing already. They can play their instruments, and they've mastered the sound.
    Yndi Halda know their way around the build, so here's hoping they spend their
    next record thinking out how the music might be taken apart.</div>"|10131.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10131-enjoy-eternal-bliss/|5.1|Mark Richardson

As ""Dumb Luck"" opens Dntel's latest, with Jimmy Tamborello singing solo about how success is just a fluke (""it's dumb luck that got you here""), we shouldn't necessarily assume he's feeling sorry for himself over the gold-selling crossover smash he enjoyed as one half of the Postal Service, a project that began at the end of Dntel's last album as a singular collaboration with Ben Gibbard called ""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"".</p><p>
    But even as the pair traded subtlety for preciousness when launching their collaboration upon the teeming masses of postal workers, marketers, and prime-time drama soundtrack coordinators, <em>Give Up</em> hit its mark more often than <em>Dumb Luck</em> does. Of course, those are two completely different bands; it's a little more fair to compare this album with his last, 2001's <em>Life Is Full of Possibilities</em>, as the two are so sonically close. Gibbard's not here, but guests like Conor Oberst, Jenny Lewis, Grizzly Bear, Lali Puna, and Mia Tai Dodd do contribute, lending vocals to Tamborello's unpredictable electronic pop. The tracks here have the same small surprises-- ear candy fighting with open spaces and dead air, clicks and pops parrying with naked and vulnerable emotions. But the guest's contributions are bit more incongruous this time around, and where <em>Possibilities</em> was haunting and desolate while being quite cathartic, <em>Dumb Luck</em> simply mopes through its duration.</p><p>
    The opener and title track shifts the focus to Tamborello's voice, and the song really is an acoustic ballad at heart, though there's plenty of drum pads and distorted winds howling over it. Grizzly Bear's contribution is barely noticeable to the largely electronic and heavily-treated ""To a Fault"", and ""I'd Like to Know"" reminds the most of Dntel's earlier work only because of Valerie Trebeljahr (Lali Puna)'s voice, whose icy ambiguity remains perfectly matched to Tamborello's coy, suggestive sonic palette. Not quite so with ""Roll On"", where Tamborello seems to act as a backing band rather than a collaborator. The finger-plucked guitar and plaintive speak-sing sounds like a cast-away from Lewis' recent album with the Watson Twins, <em>Rabbit Fur Coat</em>, with clicks and hisses that threaten to spill over the composition like an overstuffed sitcom closet as she cracks wise and faces hard facts (and clichés) about unrequited affection.
    </p><p>
    ""Rock My Boat"" skirts the line between Dntel's downtempo magic and soggy trip-hop, not helped by obvious acoustic plucking and inane lyrics (""where angels get their wings/where babies get their names"" and similar tripe). Fog's appearance lends to the more sparse and adventurous ""Natural Resources"", with oscillating tones and the unexpected crooning of woodwinds, but Andrew Broder barely sings his was through its clumsy lyric. Conor Oberst is handed the ""Evan and Chan"" of the record with ""Breakfast in Bed"", with one bare, disorienting keyboard loop like a hearing test administered by a drunk that puts all the spotlight on his vocals. Oberst's performance is restrained and surprisingly palatable as he sings about the aftermath one night stand, but aside from a few golden details we can rely on him for (cleaning wine from coffee cups, or attentively making ""sure you're breathing with a hand up to your nose""), the terminally heartbroken act was a little more believable than his sensitive gigolo.
    </p>
<p>
    While some of the album's songs are terrifically cloying, I can't call it a disappointment; it's more a case of diminishing returns. You could fall on the axiom that a happy song is much harder to write than a sad one, but Tamborello's already proved himself wildly successful at happy songs with the huge crossover success of Postal Service. Perhaps it's a case of the Postal Service's broad strokes communicating more than the finer brush of Dntel. Happiness is a far more complicated emotion on <em>Dumb Luck</em>; when it comes, it's fleeting, bewildering, and undeserved. But from a musical standpoint, I'd rather hear Tamborello fake his way through sounding happy than sitting dumbfounded and complaining when the real thing shows up.

    It's hard to believe in this age of exhaustive and exhausting music coverage, but there are still times when albums that could someday be hugely important slip through the cracks and all too quickly out of people's minds. The most glaring example of this injustice I can think of is Max Tundra's 2002 record <em>Mastered by Guy at the Exchange</em>, an album me and a small pocket of the Pitchfork hivemind  is viciously in support of, even half a decade later. An absurdly inventive and manic piece of computerized composition, <em>MBGATE</em> seemed to be fanfare for the future of pop music, or at least the indie-prefixed strain thereof, where modern technology met playfully skewed catchiness. Yet the sound of lap-pop veered instead towards recapitulating synth-pop tropes and rutting in melancholy, and nobody seemed to notice Max Tundra's valiant efforts.</p><p>
    Jona Bechtolt, who records as all-caps YACHT when he's not half of the Blow, appears to have noticed, even if it took him until his third recording under the moniker to let it show. YACHT's first two albums, <em>MEGA</em> and <em>Super Warren MMIV</em>, were both middling endeavors of laptop navel-gazing, the kind of home-beat experimentation that has glutted the market for much of the mid-aughts. But on <em>I Believe in You, Your Magic Is Real</em>, Bechtolt appears to have remembered the <em>MBGATE</em> lesson that home computer music and poppy fun need not be mutually exclusive entities, freeing himself to produce an album that strives for, and fleetingly reaches, the unpredictable yet lovable heights of its ancestor.</p><p>
    Bechtolt isn't totally unfamiliar with the concept of injecting some computer embellishment into indie-ish songwriting, having performed similar duties as IT Guy for the Blow. But <em>I Believe in You</em> is another step beyond merely adding programming to Khaela Maricich's relatively straightforward tunes, occupying the same beat-prankster territory as Tundra while not drifting too far into the abrasiveness of breakcore. ""We're Always Waiting"" is a prime example, first toying with an 8-bit version of the ""Time Is Tight"" vamp, pausing mid-song for a tongue-in-cheek materialist cheerleader chant, and climaxing with a proggy astral synth being henpecked by ringtones and presets. ""It's Coming to Get You"" runs a similar path with a primal-punk drum foundation and cutesy woah-oh-oh backing vocals, while ""See a Penny (Pick It Up)"" puts Jamie Lidell-style falsetto faux-soul singing and a chugging guitar riff against a musical backdrop that changes every 30 seconds, finally exploding in a skittering-beat orgy.
    </p>
<p>
    All these experiments could easily sink under heavy pretensions (as one might argue the instrumental ""If Music Could Cure All That Ails You"" does), but Bechtolt lightens his ballast with a sense of humor throughout. It doesn't always work; introducing fellow laptoppers Eats Tapes for a ""solo"" halfway through ""It's All the Same Price"" is pretty funny, the chopped-and-screwed outro to ""Drawing in the Dark"" not so much. Occasionally Bechtolt's jokes don't just fizzle, they cross the line into outright annoyance, like the meta-aware ""The Magic Beat"" (basically Bechtolt singing about how awesome he is over a loop too busy to claim perfection) or the Kanye-esque shout-out speech of ""Your Magic Is Real"". But even the missteps are indicative of a playfulness lacking on previous YACHT efforts, a charismatic goofiness that pervades the music as well as the lyrics and interjections.
    </p>
<p>
    While <em>I Believe in You, Your Magic Is Real</em> doesn't approach the future-thrill that <em>MBGATE</em> gave a small portion of us five years back, it does at least thrive in its shadow, bursting with unique and catchy lap-pop with the best of intentions. Even its merely above-average success rate draws renewed attention to the promise of a true indie-pop/electronic hybrid, presenting both a rock-based sound with deemphasized guitar and fewer tired post-punk influences, and an electronic adventurism that doesn't come too unmoored from conventional song structure while retaining a playful unpredictability. YACHT may not be the innovative and distinctive force that Max Tundra proved himself to be, but as a willing disciple, he's wise enough to harvest in Tundra's fertile territory.

    Crammed Discs was founded in the 1980s and has
    enjoyed a long and venerable tenure as one of the most boldly eclectic
    independent labels around, stocking its catalog with music from all over the
    world without bothering to look for an ethnomusicological angle. This
    compilation of recent Crammed music follows in the tradition of the label's two
    recent Global Soundclash compilations of vault material from the 80s, jumping
    from continent to continent (fifteen countries in all) and style to style with
    intentional abandon.</p><p>
    Thing is, all this music, be it from Macedonia or
    the U.S. or the Congo or Brazil, is so blurred and blended that it doesn't
    sound the least bit weird sequenced together on the same disc. It's more like
    twenty flavors of pop music; like rocky road or moose tracks or one of these
    other sundae flavors in the ice cream case, those flavors are all composed of
    varied ingredients, some ethnic, some technological, some theoretical, some
    pop. If there's an underlying political thrust to it, it's that governments
    that still treat borders like walls are swimming against the currents of art, culture,
    and information.</p><p>
    So you get the swirling Saharan guitar and chanting
    of Tartit, one of the handful of Tuareg bands to break internationally of late
    flowing right into British electro/jazz/folk band Wise in Time, and it makes
    sense. The guitars in both songs play hypnotic patterns, and though they're
    very different in tone and timbre, the two recordings feel like logical
    companions with this common thread easing the transition. Brazilian songstress
    Cibelle gets together with Devendra Banhart for a light bossa nova cover of
    Caetano Veloso's ""London, London"" that begins acoustic and gradually
    passes through psychedelic flourishes into outright dub, with the two of them
    literally laughing all the way.
    </p>
<p>
    Some of the genre blends are brilliant. Euro-Brazilian
    band Zuco 103 tosses Brazilian choral vocals descended from Sergio Mendes over
    an intense three-against-four groove that sounds like it came straight off an
    Ethiopian rock record from 1975 and it works so well you wonder why it took so
    long. The Eastern European bands included represent a small sampling of the
    traditionally influenced pop that's pouring from that part of the world these
    days. It makes sense that the music would be so exuberant-- these are, after
    all, people who spent almost half a century under oppressive communist regimes
    just aching for the chance to express themselves freely. 
    </p>
<p>
    Taraf de Haïdouks' ""A Stork Crosses the
    Danube"" is a river of hand percussion and dazzling violin that bursts into
    a raging flood halfway through-- it's what we might have heard from Raymond
    Scott if he'd been born a gypsy. The Russ &amp; Roc remix of Mahala Raï Banda's
    ""Morceau D'Amour/Spoitoresa"" opens with a haunting, melismatic male
    vocal singing nearly a cappella for over a minute before jumping into a jerky,
    beat-driven gypsy brass workout that features horns and violins alike playing
    at about nine thousand miles and hour and yet doing it with great artistry. 
    </p>
<p>
    Konono No.1 and Kasai All-Stars both drop in from
    the <em>Congotronics</em> series with electrified thumb pianos and makeshift amps
    blazing, but the most flattening thing on the disc is the wild spy-funk of
    ""Psychoscout"" by Belgium's Flat Earth Society, which merges big band
    jazz from the thirties with 70s soundtracks, vintage Euro-jazz, and the
    free-funk of guys like Donald Byrd, Archie Shepp and Pharoah Sanders. While
    it's safe to say just about anyone could find something to like here, the
    inverse is also true: The hazy folk of France's Hugo and the super-breezy
    Brazilian pop of Apollo Nove and Bebel Gilberto aren't my kind of thing, but
    they have enough quality that they just might be yours. 
    </p>
<p>
<em>20 Ways</em> is definitely a solid compilation,
    but it also aspires to be a little more than just that. Beyond simply showing
    off a bit of the catalog for the uninitiated listener, this disc's compilers
    are trying to make a broader point about how pusillanimous genre distinctions
    and categories are and how meaningless borders can be. Is it a point that needs
    making today? I look at my newspaper and all the articles about hatefulness,
    malice, callousness, war, and brinksmanship, and I can't help thinking that a
    reminder of how alike we all are at our cores can never hurt.

    Suffolk, England resident Chantal Passamonte has been incorporating field
    recordings into pulsating, grimy beats since the mid-90s, when a prolific
    career spinning as DJ Chantal gave way to organic experiments off the dance
    floor. With each successive album on Warp, Mira Calix has migrated away from
    any discernible genre. She scraps familiar structure in favor of
    ""conducting"" live crickets, using rocks as percussion, and
    masterfully orchestrating strings, winds, and piano around such innovations. <em>Eyes
    Set Against the Sun</em> is not unlike Herbert's <em>Score</em> in its visually
    evocative mood-making.</p><p>
    The album is reverential to physicality, focusing on the organic rather than
    the theoretical. While the songs don't always confine themselves to the
    development-climax-denouement format, there's often a complex reworking of
    classical structures going on. With modern flair, Passamonte will stick with a line of melody for an unexpectedly long time: the pizzicato string
    section on ""The Way You Are When"", for instance, is a creepy filmic
    scene, but resists the added drama of counter-melodies and modifying twists.
    Instead, whispering vocals just barely enhance the pressurized tension of
    having the pizzicato riff repeated ad infinitum. Just under eleven minutes long, the song is epic without
    being overindulgent, and it turns out there is something of a backbone, a loop
    back to the soothing string legato of its opening minutes, much as a symphony
    might. At the close, a youthful choral section strives to reach emotive heights
    the song hadn't yet dared to. There's no discernible
    matrix enclosing the piece in precedent or audience expectation, and many
    of the songs seem to quietly thumb their nose at the human role even as they're
    dependent on it.</p><p>
    Passamonte's curious meanderings with water effects and lifelike
    instrumentation (string plucks, pulls, and scrapes) on ""Because to
    Why"" make for a dark scene. Along with two other tracks, this opener
    conveys the most explicit verbal messages on the album, the rest of the songs
    liberated in our imagination by minimal or nonexistent vocals. On
    ""Why"" and its follow-up ""The Stockholm Syndrome"", she
    juxtaposes what could be joyous lyrics with minor keys and blasts of Dr. Who
    synths. ""Umbra/Penumbra"" brings us a resolute piano melody, happier
    string loops, and skulking drum machines amid the words, ""You make me feel
    like summer's never coming/ You make me feel like nothing's ever true.""
    Exploring this contrast both pokes fun at the decisive, long-understood
    emotional meaning behind major and minor keys. Or, if we are to retain those
    old meanings, suggests how her words may be connoted positively.
    </p>
<p>
    Passamonte has performed alongside the London Sinfonietta and created
    soundscapes for art installations. As Mira Calix, she expresses her interest in
    crossing artistic endeavors with natural processes. Her effects borrow from
    nature, imitate it, and deferentially fuse it with man-made interpretation, as
    on ""Belonging (No Longer Mix)"", which draws on tribal music, dance
    halls, weather systems, wing-beats, and computers for a glaringly mechanized
    atmosphere that's still utterly free of human presence. Mira Calix hasn't
    exactly embraced lyricism, teetering between landscape soundtrack and songbook
    on many of her releases. Here, vocals take a definitive back seat-- when they
    do appear, it's as a ghostly, digitally fabricated instrument that inserts
    language into the broadly relatable wash of beautiful, scary, preliterate
    meaning. Passamonte's playful, deeply moving orchestration continually poses new
    questions about music's own language. Written English doesn't necessarily
    get in the way, but the voiceless material is a book without pictures that
    speaks volumes.

Yet it was at just such a retreat that the members of the long-forgotten Milwaukee group Silmaril first assembled back at the dawn of the 1970s. Named after the sacred stones from J.R.R. Tolkien's mythological universe (thank you Wikipedia), Silmaril soon embarked together in a star-crossed attempt to unite their common passions for progressive British folk-rock, Middle Earth lore, and Christianiaty. Led by the tormented eccentric Matthew Peregrine, aka Jim Boulet, the group recorded two albums worth of material in 1973-74 before disbanding and vanishing into obscurity.</p><p>
    Now, in a rather remarkable bit of archeology, Locust Music has assembled <em>The Voyage of Icarus</em>, which compiles what are presumably the highlights from Silmaril's scarce body of work. The collection features material from Silmaril's lone self-released album<em> Given Time or the Several Roads</em>, as well as several tracks from their never-released follow-up <em>No Mirrored Temple</em>. As might be expected, much of this material exhibits many of the outsider hallmarks so peculiar to privately pressed albums of the era: handmade production, awkward flights of lyrical fancy, and a notable lack of prudent self-editing. At their best, however, Silmaril here are able to neatly translate Peregrine's strange, troubled visions into music of disarming simplicity and splendor.</p><p>
    Though not exactly the Syd Barrett-like madcap this album's press materials might lead you to believe, there is little question Peregrine was a deeply conflicted artist and individual. The chief source of this conflict was his homosexuality, which needless to say ran contrary to his devoutly conservative religious beliefs. This internal schism seems to have fated Peregrine to a lifetime of painful soul-searching, and he soon became enamored with the controversial Catholic Pentecostal movement, whose charismatic services encourage speaking in tongues and the convulsive channeling of the Holy Spirit. Joining him in his quests as Silmaril were fellow Christian musicians Tom Tews, Michael San Filippo, multi-instrumentalist William Pint, and female vocalist Sharon Larke.
    </p><p>
    One certainly doesn't have to search hard to find evidence of Peregrine's inner turmoil within Silmaril's music. He comes close to spelling it out explicitly on such tracks as ""Velvet and Gold the Dancer"", on which he declares ""on the dark wind Satan's choir is riding"" and that ""the night and the day are sharply divided/ The day walks in freedom/ the night walks in chains."" Even on the quieter, hymn-like pieces ""Windbridge"" or ""Not Enough"" Peregrine sounds restless and ill-at-ease, singing that ""light is not enough to quench the thirst"" and of ""how useless waking is."" 
    </p>
<p>
    As a live act, Silmaril would incorporate an arsenal of instruments that would include a moon guitar, a light-flashing synthesizer, and a healthy variety of flutes and recorders. On record, however, they opt for a simpler approach, augmenting Peregrine's acoustic songs with only the occasional flourish of sitar or pump organ. In many cases, as on the opening ""Poustinia"", it is Larke's voice that rings the loudest, which can be unfortunate since her vocals frequently betray the infernal Joan Baez influence that tends to so plague church choirs throughout the Midwest. 
    </p>
<p>
    In the material Silmaril recorded for the unreleased <em>No Mirrored Temple</em>, Peregrine's songwriting voice grows progressively more apocalyptic, as he sows tracks like ""Lamb of God"" and ""Song of the Apocalypse"" with biblical prophesy. (And he gets right down to <em>Left Behind</em> brass tacks on the spoken word ""Revelation 13:11:18"".) This direction proved to be too much for Peregrine's bandmates, as San Filippo and Krukowski soon left the group. And though Peregrine and Pint continued to perform on the on the Renaissance Faire circuit, Silmaril was, for all practical purposes, over before it had begun. Eventually, Peregrine's music, art, and nomadic life directed him away from the church, and he sadly succumbed to AIDS-related illness in the mid 90s at the age of 41. Period curiosity though it is, <em>The Voyage of Icarus</em> does a splendid job exhuming this intriguing chapter of the recent past, and restoring a glimmer to Peregrine and Silmaril's modest legacy.

    No longer can Arctic Monkeys be considered underdogs;
    given the notoriously fickle English music scene, perhaps that means they should
    be. Last year, the Sheffield quartet's <em>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</em> became the fastest-selling debut album
    in UK music history, spawning two #1 singles and winning the Mercury Prize. The
    band's early press clippings, like those for Gnarls Barkley, Lily Allen, and Clap Your Hands
    Say Yeah, highlighted their rapid netroots success story as much as their music,
    which is a traditionalist brew of observational storytelling, post-Libertines
    meat-and-potatoes guitar rock, and the heady enthusiasm of youth.</p><p>
    Fifteen months later, Arctic Monkeys' sophomore effort is
    already receiving a royal welcome at home, though the premature use of words
    like ""comeback"" underscores the precariousness of the group's
    situation. As for the Arctics, they've come back tougher, sharper, and bleaker,
    even if to non-fans of this brand of no-frills Britrock it probably still sounds
    pretty much the same. <em>Favourite Worst Nightmare </em>is in some
    ways better and in other ways worse than its breakthrough 2006 predecessor, but
    above all it's the assured statement of a self-conscious young band determined
    to deserve their acclaim. Eventually, maybe they will.</p><p>
    In interviews, singer and lyricist Alex Turner stays low-key about his abilities. ""You never think, like, 'We're amazing,
    aren't we?',"" the 21-year-old recently told <em>Mojo</em>. Nevertheless, <em>Favourite
    Worst Nightmare </em>flexes Arctic Monkeys' considerable songwriting and musical
    muscle with a confidence that sets the group apart from their UK rock peers; the latest
    songs seem to glimpse the possibility of greatness even when they fail to
    attain it. Turner finds new emotional depth on songs like breakup anthem
    ""Do Me a Favour"", which climbs patiently from baggy drums to a searing,
    guitar-led crescendo. Gradually shifting from the man's perspective to the
    woman's, he concludes, ""How to tear apart the ties that bind?/ Perhaps
    'fuck off' might be too kind,"" his raggedly bereaved croon adding Damon
    Albarn to the list of plausible vocal comparisons alongside Morrissey and Noel
    Gallagher. Similarly, the drum-less and bass-less ""Only One Who
    Knows"" is another big step forward for the band, taking a more deliberate,
    atmospheric view of a dying relationship: ""They made it far too easy to
    believe/ That true romance can't be achieved these days."" <br/>
</p>
<p>
    If such heartache is a fresh addition to Turner's songs, so too,
    it seems, is the feeling that makes the pain possible. Real affection
    glimmered through the bickering on the debut's ""Mardy Bum"", but the girls
    on that album are mostly fake-tanned participants in meat-market mating rituals
    (""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"", ""Still Take You
    Home""). By contrast, <em>Favourite Worst
    Nightmare </em>unveils one of Turner's first proper love songs: The closing
    ""505"", draped with an apparent Ennio Morricone organ sample,
    poignantly if none too adventurously describes Turner's longing to get back to
    a hotel room where his lover awaits. ""I'm always just about to go and
    spoil the surprise/ Take my hands off of your eyes too soon,"" Turner
    admits, displaying his usual gift for vivid imagery. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    However, some of <em>Favourite
    Worst Nightmare </em>continues in the unfortunate direction of last year's <em>Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys </em>EP,
    which found the band coming unappealingly to grips with fame. Turner's
    obsession with poseurs has always been the least likeable thing about his
    lyrics, but songs like ""Fake Tales of San Francisco"" at least
    reflected a nagging desire not just to repel phonies but to crave something true and real; here, with the band's debut
    certified as the ""fifth greatest British album ever"" by the <em>NME</em>, Turner's unrelenting bitterness
    makes him sound like one of the petty fakes he despises. It doesn't help that
    first single ""Brianstorm""-- ostensibly about a T-shirt- and
    tie-wearing industry creep the band met in Japan-- shows the Arctics at their
    least melodic, swapping out the Supergrass ""Richard III"" riff that
    opened the debut and replacing it with pummeling, double-speed aggression. ""Teddy Picker"" heaps scorn on ""professional
    pretenders,"" comparing the music industry to the toy crane machines in
    arcades, and mocking kids who ""dream of making it, whatever that
    means"". Check the mirror, dude, though Turner also squeezes in what sounds
    like a pointed jab at the music press: ""When did your lists replace the twist
    and turn?"" Fair play; the twist and turn here is, indeed, fab. <br/>
</p>
<p>
<em>Favourite Worst
    Nightmare</em> flirts, too, with the notion of the Arctics
    as an indie-dance group, enlisting the guidance of Simian Mobile Disco's
    James Ford (who also produced the recent debut album by Klaxons). The throttling playing of drummer Matt Helders has been a big
    part of Arctic Monkeys' appeal since the beginning, so the differences here are
    subtle: A thick bass groove on the Dr. Suessian ""This House Is a
    Circus"" (""berzerkus""?), four-on-the-floor beat on the <em>Wizard of Oz</em>-steeped<em> </em>""nostalgia"" critique ""Old Yellow Bricks"", or repetitive
    fuzz-tone guitar jerkiness on fast-paced ""If You Were There, Beware"".
    While Ford coaxes commanding performances from the band, he modifies their
    trad-rock trajectory only slightly; Arctic Monkeys and Klaxons were never as
    different as the UK
    press suggested.</p><p>
    If <em>Favourite Worst
    Nightmare </em>is notably lacking something, it's another song like the debut's standout, ""A Certain Romance"". Arctic Monkeys have now traveled the
    world, and their new material veers from such detail-rich tales of growing
    up in provincial England,
    at times focusing instead on subject matter Blur pursued with sharper wit (and only
    slightly sharper hooks) on <em>The Great
    Escape</em>. ""Fluorescent Adolescent"", the current album's most
    obvious hit, shares a festival-ready ska rhythm with the debut's ""Mardy
    Bum"" (which shares it with Sublime's ""Santeria""), but the new
    song describes something Turner can hardly know much about: a middle-aged woman's
    dreary sex life. ""You used to get it in your fishnets/ Now you only get
    it in your night dress,"" Turner cleverly sympathizes. Sure, Arctic Monkeys may
    no longer belong to their old world of kids wearing ""knackered Converse"", drinking underage, and getting accosted by bouncers, but they're
    still too boldly tuneful not to find yourself rooting for them.

    Just as in the restaurant business, it's always an impressive feat for a record label to reach the 10-year milestone, and getting there requires a special combination of perserverance, customer satisfaction, and location, location, location. Based reliably in Bloomington, Indiana for more than 11 years, Secretly Canadian has now managed to achieve this elusive balance on their way to releasing more titles than any other Indiana-based label in history. (And aside from SC's sister label Jagjaguwar I personally can't really think of a close runner-up off the top of my head.)</p><p>
    Formed in 1996 by friends Eric Weddle, Jonathan Cargill, and Ben and Chris Swanson, Secretly Canadian's longevity has always seemed particularly notable since it has never been easy to pinpoint the label's specialty. By definition most of their acts can be termed indie rock, but the label's eclectic roster goes a long way toward illustrating how imprecise and ultimately useless that designation can be. More than anything, Secretly Canadian has been most remarkable for their uncommon loyalty to their artists, providing a comfortable home base where such performers as Daniel Smith (Danielson/Br. Danielson/Danielson Famile), Jason Molina (Songs: Ohia, Magnolia Electric Company), and Jens Lekman are given the necessary leeway for their styles to evolve and mature.</p><p>
    Although by this time Secretly Canadian has issued over 150 records, the label's operators now belatedly celebrate their 100<sup>th</sup> release with <em>SC100, </em>a compilation that features 18 veteran SC artists covering each other's songs. [Cue Krusty the Clown's ""Ugh, this is always death"" groan.] In order to help keep the whole 100<sup>th</sup> release aspect of the collection legit, the artists involved have restricted themselves to selecting songs that appeared somewhere on Secretly Canadian's first 99 releases. 
    </p>
<p>
    This format-- though mindful of historical accuracy-- unfortunately works against the listener in a couple of crucial ways. First off, it means that the work such stellar recent signees as Antony and the Johnsons and Frida Hyvönen is not included. And perhaps more importantly, it means that many (if not most) of the original versions of these songs are only going to be readily familiar to true Secretly Canadian scholars, thus eliminating what is usually half the fun of a covers album to begin with. 
    </p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, it's hard to grouse much when the late Nikki Sudden jumpstarts <em>SC100</em> with his swaggering cover of June Panic's ""See(ing) Double"", or when Songs:Ohia keep the round-robin going with a spirited rip through Sudden's ""The Last Bandit"". Suzanne Langille-- whose luminous duet albums with Loren MazzaCane Conners stand as some of the hidden gems of the Secretly Canadian back catalog-- translates Songs:Ohia's ""Structure: Necessity"" into a typically personalized, harrowing epic, while Jens Lekman brightens the corners of Scout Niblett's ""Your Beat Kicks Back Like Death"" with whistles, spry bossanova rhythms, and immaculate vocal harmonies. 
    </p>
<p>
    Things get considerably more muddled through <em>SC100</em>'s middle passages, as such singer-songwriters as Danielson, Damien Jurado, and Dave Fischoff attempt to keep the swapmeet lively by inserting their own distinctive quirks onto what is in most instances already heavily quirky material. As a result we are left a series of non-starters that includes June Panic's tepid version of the Danielson Famile's ""Fruitful Weekend"", which excises most of the original's crazed tent-revival glory, and Swearing at Motorist's clunky, inconsequential take on Havergal's ""Lungs for the Race"". 
    </p>
<p>
    Even iffier is the inclusion of such ill-matched genre pieces as Racebannon's quasi-metal ""The Real Thing"" or Cornelius Boots' multi-sax extravaganza ""Clubber Lang"". Though not exactly uninteresting, and in their own unique way emblematic of Secretly Canadian's streak for adventure, these tracks dampen <em>SC100</em>'s celebratory atmosphere as effectively as if they had frosted the anniversary cake with coarse grain mustard. And while there is no question that Secretly Canadian's continued successful existence is a triumph worth celebrating, most listeners will be better off settling back with a favorite copy of Danielson's <em>Ships</em> or Antony's <em>I Am a Bird Now </em>and raising a quiet toast in private.

Not only is he the lead singer/songwriter for this pop-noir outfit, he's also the only person to appear on both albums that bear the band's name, after a split with the London-based line-up that recorded 2004's <em>The Runaway Found</em> sent Andrew retreating to his childhood home of New Zealand to start the band anew for <em>Nux Vomica</em>. But if the Veils are a band in name only, Andrews has a good enough reason to use the alias: His father Barry is a founding member of XTC, and the younger Andrews has probably read too many Rufus Wainwright or Sean Lennon reviews that can't separate the prodigal son's work from that of their famous fathers.</p><p>
    Unlike those mentioned above, the Veils' parentage really is an irrelevant footnote-- though if you told me Finn's father was Nick Cave or Jeffrey Lee Pierce, then we'd have a more thorough discussion of heredity on our hands. To be completely reductive, <em>Nux Vomica</em> is the new Bad Seeds record that Cave has forsaken in favor of Grinderman, or the first Gun Club album to crack the UK top 20. It's a development that wasn't entirely anticipated by <em>The Runaway Found</em>, whose lush balladry posited the Veils as arch dramatists in the tradition of <em>Dog Man Star</em>-era Suede, post-Richey Manics and post-fame Pulp-- hearts firmly on sleeves, but with the spilled blood all cleaned up. <em>Nux Vomica</em> retains its predecessor's flair for the grandiose, but repositions the Veils as purveyors of a gothic Americana, inhabiting desert-stormy vistas that are just expansive enough to house the band's most valuable asset: Andrews' magnetic, outsize persona.</p><p>
    The parallels to Cave run from the superficial (the way both men enunciate the word ""loooord"") to the substantial, as Andrews shares Cave's preoccupation with crises of faith. But even at their most depraved, Cave's songs still portray moral redemption as an end to be, if not always achieved, then at least valued. Andrews speaks in more obvious metaphors-- ""There's an angel at my table/ And a devil up my sleeve""-- but is more ambivalent about his belief in god, or even love; as the Celtic jaunt ""Calliope!"" argues, when unrequited romance turns requited, ""what's there left to believe in?"" For Andrews, this pervasive ennui is all the more reason for him to camp and vamp it up-- and so the domestic doldrums of ""Advice For Young Mothers To Be"" get dressed up in a deceptively cheery ska-disco; by contrast ""Jesus for the Jugular"" mocks organized religion using the theatrics of the pulpit, its taunting blues riff and thundering bass-drum lurch goading the singer into Black Francis hysterics. But instead of simply positing a god/devil dichotomy, Andrews deviously emphasizes their co-dependency, asking, ""would the fox be as quick if he hadn't his hound?""</p><p>
    Such proselytizing is always more convincing when it's punctuated with big bangs, and the reconstituted Veils deliver them with such startling proficiency-- the spaghetti-western cavalry charge of ""Not Yet"", the lightning-crash clamor of ""Pan"", the horse-whipped guitar/organ shocks of the title track-- that they make more stately romantique turns like ""A Birthday Present"" and ""One Night on Earth"" sound like the work of a different, more typical Britpop band. But then <em>Nux Vomica</em> is so focused on the big picture, it never gets undermined by the small stuff.</p></div>"|10134.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10134-nux-vomica/|7.6|Stuart Berman

    After its brief respite, the floodgates of dancepunk have opened aga-- okay, wait wait wait, I can't ignore this any longer: Why in the world would you call your band Shitdisco? As a music reviewer, you get some pretty absurd and/or wretched names showing up in you mailbox from day to day, but Shitdisco is perhaps the most dreadful one I've come across in some time. What do you tell your Grandma when she asks you what your little band is called? If you hit it big on the radio, are you prepared to be referred to as [Bleep]Disco or Poopdisco? Do you really want to open yourself up to so many easy and pun-gross putdowns? I honestly can't believe nobody talked you out of it.</p><p>
    Begrudgingly, I'll admit that Shitdisco is an appropriate name for Shitdisco's sound; had it been a genre name, I probably would prefer it to the atrocity of nu rave. Shitdisco is a band that plays disco-punk, a conclusion I made after hearing the band say the word ""disco"" many, many, many times on their record. Hearkening back to the heady days of 2003, the Scottish foursome meticulously recreate the playbook of bands like the Rapture and Hot Hot Heat, without really bothering to add anything new, other than a misguided sense of brand identity.</p><p>
    Most of the record sounds like the band is checking off ingredients one by one from the nutritional information label for ""House of Jealous Lovers"". Opening track ""I Know Kung Fu"", after a brief, burundi-drum Adam &amp; the Ants false-start, falls back on not only the staccato guitar lines and persistent hi-hat of dictionary-definition dancepunk, it also cribs the numerical shouting, background ululations, and cowbell rhythmic supplements of their (for the most part) still-living ancestors. Other tracks opt for the William Gibson gritty sci-fi lyrical approach, strange time signatures and UFO sound effects that have marked this latest flareup of the sound, joining the geek-dance-rock cause of peers like Klaxons. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    As familiar as Shitdisco's sound is, it's also reasonably well executed, occasionally striking that perfect balance of reckless abandon and rhythmic semi-competence that marks the best attempts at merging the dance with the punk. ""Reactor Party"" separates itself from the parade of déjà vu by channeling the tweaked and pinched tension of Devo, a rich point of reference mysteriously lacking from the genre's first wave. Meanwhile, songs such as ""Lover of Others"" wobbles right on the precipice of losing control, in the danger zone where the groove sounds like it's playing the band rather than vice versa, while ""OK"" and ""72 Virgins"" exhibit Shitdisco's ability to establish a sinister bass undercurrent that doesn't sap the band's energy.
    </p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, it's discouraging that a 35-minute record starts doubling back so often by the end, with the melody for ""3D Sex Show"" recycled a mere four tracks later on ""Fear of the Future"" and the falsetto backing vocals only knowing two or three tricks. This internal repetition, combined with the derivativeness of Shitdisco's sound to begin with, is sobering reminder of why dancepunk came and went so quickly just a few years back. As long as these bands' ideal of dance music remains flash-frozen in 1980, it's likely the sound will struggle to expand upon its limited potential, no matter how many times it's revived or new names it is awarded-- a squelchy synthesizer and a cowbell doesn't cut it anymore. For a band like Shitdisco that has handicapped itself right from the get-go with their horrible name (Shitdisco! I still can't get over it), settling for the status quo is a recipe for obscurity, no matter how competently reenacted.

    After more than twenty years together and only midlevel fame, the Cowboy Junkies
    could have easily-- and understandably-- settled into an AOR (in this case, adult-oriented
    roots) sound and solicited the same audience as Norah Jones and Jesse Harris.
    But to their considerable credit, they've never repeated themselves nor backed
    away from new collaborations or ideas; they've followed their own particular
    muse, resulting in songs that are outwardly pretty but inwardly prickly. Case
    in point: ""Brand New World"", the opening track on their eleventh
    album, the awkwardly titled and artworked <em>At the End of Paths Taken</em>. It
    begins with Margo Timmins singing a laundry list of mundane matters--
    ""Mouths to feed, shoes to buy, rent to pay...tears to dry""-- but as
    the song progresses, she reveals that those tears aren't her children's, but
    her own. ""Brand New World"" describes a peculiarly parental
    claustrophobia in which family trap rather than fulfill you-- a much darker
    message than expected, especially considering there are three siblings in the
    band-- but one that runs ominously throughout <em>Paths Taken</em>.</p><p>
    The Junkies take just as many risks musically as lyrically. ""Follower
    2"", the album's centerpiece, begins as a slow lament, just Margo and the
    band playing quietly, but at the 2:30 mark, it blooms into something different,
    adding a cat's cradle of strings that almost sound abstract.
    ""Mountain"" exchanges those strings (the album's recurring sonic motif) for
    a low, anonymous male voice delivering a monologue underneath the music, adding
    to the muddiness of Michael Timmins' guitar and the dark edge of the lyrics.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, none of this is the least bit convincing. 
    </p>
<p>
    On <em>Paths Taken</em>, the Junkies sound like a band battling obsolescence
    and trying entirely too hard to make an impression as an inventive and
    therefore relevant band. The album's dark tone and theme sound painted on: the
    parental anomie of ""Brand New World"", for example, never feels
    especially real or dramatic, and the specific details of the first verse never
    amount to anything concrete, but bog down in language about shadows and rivers.
    Likewise, all those off-putting musical elements-- the Mike Oldfield vibes on
    ""Mountain"", the choir of children on ""My Only Guarantee""--
    are rarely integral to the songs, but rather seem like empty gestures toward
    some imagined avant-garde. The Cowboy Junkies have always seemed a little
    distant-- in fact, their measured matter-of-factness in a genre that often
    prizes showy expression has been refreshing. However, that distance has turned
    into complacency. 
    </p>
<p>
    These regrettable trends intersect on ""My Little Basquiat"", a
    strong candidate for their worst track ever. Against an immediately forgettable
    sonic backdrop, Margo wonders whether her son will grow up to be a troubled
    artist like Basquiat and her daughter a gymnast like Nadia Comaneci. There's a
    self-satisfaction to these references that's pretty excruciating, but the
    whispered exchanges between Margo and Michael, which turn the verses into
    awkward call-and-responses, truly sink the song. 
    </p>
<p>
    On the other hand, it's telling that the best track on <em>Paths Taken</em>--
    i.e., the only one that commits no damning musical sin-- is also the one that
    feels most familiar: with its basic blues structure and abrasive guitar
    (Michael is capable of searing guitar tones), ""Cutting Board Blues""
    could have been lifted from <em>Whites Off Earth Now!</em>, their 1987 debut.
    It's a sharp reminder of where their strengths lie, even two decades on. It may
    not be glamorous, but it's certainly better than the coldly cerebral,
    ultimately heartless alternative.

Joanna Newsom's follow-up is a lot less formally ambitious: A three-song quickie, with one new song and two old ones,
    recorded live in the studio with four members of her acoustic touring band. Of course, ""less formally ambitious"" on Newsom's scale is off the charts on virtually anyone else's. ""I was coding a lot of my experience in terms of excess of water,"" she told Pitchfork last November about the lyrical process that produced <em>Ys</em>, and <em>Ys Street Band</em>-- especially its tremendous new song, ""Colleen""-- seems to be conceptual overspill from the album.</p><p>
    ""Colleen"" is inarguably an excess-of-water song: If I'm reading the handwritten lyric sheet right, it's a sort of <em>Drawing Restraint 9</em>-in-reverse scenario about a woman who's forgotten she used to be a whale, being confronted with the knowledge of her past. (Vivid detail: She's now wearing a corset, which of course would be made of whalebone. A whale in her dream says ""What's cinched 'round your waist, Colleen?/ Is that my very own baleen?/ No! Have you forgotten everything?"") It may be a way of addressing the kind of <em>Chinese Democracy</em>-style creative block that comes from immersion in making an Important Work: ""I tilled and planted, but could not produce/ Not root, nor leaf, nor flower, nor bean; Lord!/ It seemed I overwatered everything.""</p><p>
    Too much water again-- and Newsom even line-breaks like a print poet. It's true: She does lead with her lyrics. But she's also an extraordinary and unmistakable tune-maker. Her melodies are Proustian, winding things, so the details of their arrangements and performances signify a lot. Recast without the immense orchestrations of its <em>Ys</em> incarnation, ""Cosmia"" becomes more intimate, less a framed-and-mounted artifact. And touring seems to have sanded some of the snags off of Newsom's voice; she's singing better here than she has on record before.</p><p>
    The danger of using acoustic instruments is that people may mistake you for a ""folk"" musician, which Newsom really isn't-- although ""Colleen"", more than anything else she's written, owes a lot of its lyrical and musical cadences to traditional music of the British
    Isles. (Remember, ""colleen"" isn't just a name: Its Irish usage can just mean ""girl"" or ""young woman."") The cadences of her songs and singing have a lineage of which she's well aware; this time, there
    are faint echoes of Kate Bush and (especially when drummer Neal Morgan harmonizes with her on an excellent remake of <em>The Milk-Eyed Mender</em>'s ""Clam, Crab, Cockle, Cowrie"") <em>Desire</em>-era Bob Dylan, both of
    whom are similarly well-connected to their own aesthetic roots. But there's nobody else playing Newsom's game right now, and as good as it is that she can produce a varnished marvel like <em>Ys</em>, it's even more heartening to see her moving beyond it this quickly.</p></div>"|10129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10129-joanna-newsom-the-ys-street-band-ep/|8.7|Douglas Wolk

These Leeds guys were never really among the pathbreakers, innovators, or celebrated stars of British indie; they were the workhorse and the house band. Fierce but straightforward, steady and prolific, love-them-or-don't-mind-them: For quite a while there, this was the flagship example of what an ordinary, damned-good UK indie rock band sounded like-- the Spoon of another place and time. But it's exactly that quality that makes it possible to assemble six discs of their BBC radio performances, something you couldn't manage for a lot of better-remembered bands. This workhorse was reliable enough-- and well enough loved-- to come back again and again, playing ever more shows for another beloved indie standard-bearer: John Peel, one of the band's great supporters.</p><p>
    Expect few surprises on these discs, then: No extended noise jams, no surprise alternate versions, not even <em>that </em>many rare tracks or covers. (The one exception won't be a surprise to long-time fans: The set contains about a dozen tracks of the Slavic folk music the band played as the Ukrainians. This is the sole respect in which the Weddoes were multiple decades ahead of their time.) What you get here is just the tight and frantic live act you can infer from any given Wedding Present album, and with about the same band-in-a-room production style. It's a fan bonanza of great performances-- which, for six discs, it had kinda better be-- with the Easter eggs limited to stuff like radio chat, a TV theme cover, and a few new tricks during their 2004 reformation: exactly as straightforward as the band has always been. That's 12 radio sessions, a John Peel birthday bash, and three full-length concerts, stretching over a decade (plus that 2004 re-start) of incredibly involving guitar music.</p><p>
    And these guys do love their guitars. Early on, back in 1986, they made them jangle as fast as they could manage, always racing ahead in a grand celebration of the very existence of amplifiers. (The very first thing that set them apart from their indie peers was having a drummer who could actually keep up.) Like the Buzzcocks before them, their rousing post-punk blur managed to be tense, scrappy, and still relentlessly poppy. What made this pop so involving, though, tended to be bandleader David Gedge, whose surprisingly conversational clenched-teeth bark falls into that low range most people use when pretending to be stern for comic effect, and whose lyrics navigated cleverly around all the bitter, childish things most people eventually laugh at themselves for thinking. (When more emo singers figure out the difference between irony and just puns, this might actually become a second respect in which the band was 20 years ahead of schedule.) These are mostly love songs-- expressed not in lovers' talk, but in the petty thought-bubbles and subtitles that might linger around it.</p><p>
    Something about that pairing-- celebratory bitterness?-- turns out marvelous, if maybe a little slanted toward the empathy of boys. The first seven sessions here capture its pop phase (and its Ukrainian one), including wild, joyous covers of ""Felicity"" (Orange Juice), ""Getting Nowhere Fast"" (Girls at our Best), and ""Happy Birthday"" (Altered Images): Put this stuff on one disc, and it'd be a must-buy. It's with the amazing eighth session, previewing songs from 1991's <em>Seamonsters</em>, that things change, and the music catches up with the lyrics: The guitars start winding between purposeful creeps and glorious, cathartic squalls, Gedge starts play-acting some serious no-joking break-up bitterness, and from there on, this band has a lot more dynamics-- and a lot more dramatic weight-- in its arsenal.</p><p>
    That makes for a decent number of stand-out performances. There are furious takes on the already-furious ""Kennedy"". There's the ease with which they shift between the snarky verses of ""So Long, Baby"", which sound like the Fall, to the apologetic chorus, which sounds like the Buzzcocks: ""In spite of all that, I still think you're dreamy."" There's a concert version of the <em>Seamonsters </em>bonus ""Fleshworld"", where we get to hear yet another power drummer nail down the flurry of snares-- occupying half of <em>every other bar</em>-- that makes the song so fearsome. There's a Peel's-birthday version of ""What Have I Said Now?"" that seems to capture the peak of this band's grim, heavy romance, and an early apex of clenched teeth and high-speed exasperation on ""All About Eve"". Most of this stuff is impressive enough that you won't even mind the tepid concert version of ""Brassneck"", or the fact that the three full-length shows are all from 1995/96, the band's comfortable middle age, or how cutting this box down to the first few non-Ukrainian Peel sessions would actually make it look more substantial.</p><p>
    When you're spending box-set money, though, it's easy to notice that ""great"" performances aren't necessarily ""revelatory"" ones; passionately nailing down the parts ceases to sound like some huge triumph, and Wedding Present songs don't exactly lend themselves to grand reinterpretations. The point of collections like this, of course, has to do with how easily you can burn out a favorite act's back catalog, making it all so familiar that your ears hardly register what's passing by: Even a mildly different live version can bring everything back to life again, and plenty of people-- English ones especially-- will appreciate this alternate history. The Wedding Present are the kind of band that can bear that level of involvement, and it's a testament to their skills and their work ethic that nearly every track here lives up to its studio counterpart. It's a sign of their workhorse nature, though, that not <em>too</em> many can aspire to do any more than that.</p></div>"|10147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10147-the-complete-peel-sessions/|7.1|Nitsuh Abebe

    ""The breathless refrain that begins the second section of ""Talking""-- ""Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up talking/ You gotta be kidding me""-- is the emotional culmination of Essie Jain's debut record <em>We Made This Ourselves</em>.  Yet as a point at which tolerance reaches its limit and her frustrations boil over, the lyric itself sounds the opposite of angry. Not as much from indolence as much as attempted decorum, Jain thoroughly suffuses  <em>Made </em>with the same sort of stately, delicate, and often somber understatement, the kind that casts the album as a possible first attempt to deal with with a number of enduring agitations.</p><p>
    Jain's thoroughgoing anti-dynamism emphasizes her distanced lyrical appraisals of situations that seem to be irrevocably broken, encapsulated by the evaluative tone of the album's title. While her plaintive voice suggests a chilly resignation, however, her words offer hope for reconciliation and repair. On ""Loaded"", she confronts a lover failing a battle with the bottle, and ""Indefinable"", ""Give"", and ""No Mistake"" all seek fresh starts for wounded relationships. The accompanying music is as minimal as the songs' single-word titles; typically, Jain accompanies herself only with piano or acoustic guitar. Other instrumentation comes and goes as necessary--  stand-up bass, accordion, bowed strings, hushed drumming from indie session-veteran Jim White-- but is strategically implemented for utmost effect.</p><p>
<em>Made</em>'s best songs, however, are those that augment Jain's lyrics most
    evocatively. After the sparse gospel opener ""Glory"", ""Haze""
    promises a more exotic future. A vaguely political lament at less-than-forthcoming
    leadership, ""Haze"" is fittingly complemented by the French horns that
    gently appear in the song's last third, which take the song to a swirling
    conclusion that feels like a call-to-arms. On ""Sailor"", Jain's tendency
    toward overdubbing her own voice translates well to violin, and what starts as
    a lone wail progressively expands and multiplies, performing in concert with
    her most fervent and gorgeous vocal performance. 
    </p>
<p>
    Most evident on ""Sailor"", but present
    in various incarnations throughout <em>Made</em> on the whole, is Jain's clear
    debt to British folk legend Sandy Denny, a singer most noted for her
    contributions to the earliest incarnation of Fairport Convention, along with
    her role as Robert Plant's counterpart on the psych-Celtic Led Zeppelin song
    ""The Battle of Evermore."" Jain's baroque approach to chamber-folk
    music is a fitting update of Denny's, and also serves as an appropriate
    counterpart to her Ba Da Bing labelmate, Beirut's Zach Condon. Both Jain and
    Condon are youthful musical prodigies interested in taking anachronistic
    Anglo-ethnic musics and presenting them through a modern lens. Although not as
    preternaturally cosmopolitan as <em>Gulag Orkestar</em> (nor does it necessarily
    strive for that distinction), <em>We Made This Ourselves</em> is an early piece
    of convincing evidence that Jain is capable of a similarly sophisticated blend
    of timeless and contemporary.

    Anticon beatsmith Brendon Whitney, aka Alias, has tapped a broad array of
    artists to fill out his <em>Collected Remixes</em>. Styles include the One AM
    Radio's indie rock, John Vanderslices's folky soundscapes, Giardini Di Miro's
    post-rock, Lali Puna's electro-pop, 13 &amp; God's abstract hip-hop, and the
    IDM of Christ. Given this diverse list of collaborators, you might expect
    equally diverse results. That the album is in fact so uniform, playing like an
    Alias solo effort that pales in comparison to last year's collaboration with
    vocalist Tarsier, highlights his weaknesses as a producer.</p><p>
    As remixers go, Alias most resembles a juicer-- no matter what you put in,
    the same homogeneous goop comes out. And ""goop"" isn't necessarily as
    negative as it sounds; it simply alludes to the sneaking suspicion that Alias
    isn't thinking about the possibilities inherent in the songs he's remixing,
    only processing them into his own nonspecific instrumental hip-hop, which tends
    to linger just this side of tedium.</p><p>
    Still, the results can be tasty or not according to what goes into the
    blender. The swooning vocals of the One AM Radio's ""What You Gave
    Away"" nestle prettily amid sputtering drums and snowy chimes. Lali Puna's
    ""Alienation"" sounds fine chopped up into clip-clopping percussion and
    live-wire synths. And Sixtoo's ""Karmic Retribution/Funny Sticks"" at
    least provides some contrast with its chaotic squalls of noise. Bum ingredients
    sour other passable concoctions: Why? appears on the remix of 13 &amp; God's
    ""Into the Trees"" and John Vanderslice appears on the remix of his
    ""Exodus Damage"" (duh); both singers have reedy, almost bracing voices
    that aren't well-suited to Alias's supa-smoove night moves.
    </p>
<p>
    The main problem with the album is that the bulk of it is virtually
    indistinguishable. Alias fashions Lunz's ""Clue"" into a skittering,
    mid-tempo synth glide, reworks Lucky Pierre's ""Crush"" into a
    skittering, mid-tempo synth glide, and then, just to shake things up, turns
    Giardini Di Miro's ""Given Ground"" into a skittering, mid-tempo synth
    glide. If you're going to be a one-trick pony, it had better be a really good
    trick. Alias's isn't bad, just severely limited and predictable, seeming always
    to conjure the same glacial atmosphere with the same sound palette and the same
    low-key dynamics. Any of these on their own might impress, but collected
    together, they blur into anonymity, lacking the diversity or the nuance
    necessary to uphold the weight of the album format.

    The Beta Band were one of the most acclaimed Scottish bands
    of the late 1990s, bringing the bucolic to the iMac age. While
    their genre-agnostic indie-with-beats blew the minds of critics suffering from
    Oasis fatigue, it never quite caught on with the broader public, and by 2005
    the group were no more. On <em>Astronomy
    for Dogs</em>, the Beta Band co-founder Gordon Anderson and former members Robin Jones and
    John Maclean revisit familiar psychedelic experiments, displaying impressive
    knowledge of pop's history but adding little to it themselves.</p><p>
    Good as it is to have these dudes back, their reunion sounds
    disappointingly anticlimactic. The piano-splashed rock 'n' roll of
    upbeat first single ""The Happy Song"" indicates the
    guys are ""happy happy happy,"" but for an unapologetically stupid pop song
    it's damningly devoid of a decent hook-- let alone the stark beauty of the
    Kinks' ""Everybody's Gonna Be Happy"". <em>Astronomy for Dogs</em> opens with solo-spattered second single
    ""Setting Sun"", something like ""All Along the Watchtower""
    with lyrics befitting the Chemical Brothers' homonymous 1996 single. What, too
    proud to call it a cover?</p><p>
    The album is full of such moments where sonic reference
    trumps songwriting, a problem that also sometimes befalls other recent purveyors of
    record-collector rock like Band of Bees and the Earlies (if I mention Girl Talk I might get fired). The Aliens skip from
    the close Cyrkle harmonies and Del Shannon guitar arpeggios of plaintive
    kiss-off ""Tomorrow"" to join Midlake's 70s soft-rock revival on
    long-haired piano whimper ""Honest Again"". Token krautrock droner
    ""Only Waiting"" exhales India-scented melodies until tripping into a
    hyperactive ""I Am the Walrus""-meets-<em>Psycho</em> orchestral psyche-out. And so on.
    </p>
<p>
    It's not that the Aliens are incapable of the pop
    fireworks that made the Beta Band a name classmates used to ask me about on their way back from <em>High Fidelity</em>.
    ""She Don't Love Me No More"" is a mild, string-enhanced take on towering
    Southern rock balladry, synth-laden ""Rox"" touches down for sidewalk-strutting
    funk, and kazoo-toting Merseybeat bouncer ""Glover"" intermittently
    morphs into a mean game of outer-space pinball. Still, even these songs sound
    more like imitations of past glory than new incarnations of the same pioneering spirit.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    The most ""Dry the Rain""-like track here, swooning anthem ""I Am the Unknown"", is perhaps illustrative of the
    Aliens' shortcomings. Picking up the weirdness of Anderson solo project Lone Pigeon, it's one
    of two songs on this album that end with the chanted reminder, ""We are the
    Aliens"". Two <em>other </em>songs shoot
    back, ""I am the Robot Man""-- and only one is future-funk breakdown
    ""Robot Man"". Whoever recorded <em>Astronomy for Dogs</em>, they're not the Beta
    Band anymore.

    When it quietly showed up on YouTube last November, the darkly surreal video for Prodigy's ""Mac 10 Handle"" felt like a glorious fluke. More than a decade ago, a teenage Prodigy-- half of the existential Queensbridge duo Mobb Deep-- had been one of the fiercest and murkiest rappers in New York. But that dark star faded quickly in 2001, when Jay-Z, onstage at Hot 97's Summer Jam, sneeringly displayed a picture of a young Prodigy wearing a dance-class uniform: ""You was a ballerina/ I got the pictures, I seen ya."" That blow seemed to send Mobb Deep into freefall. The next few years saw the group making a series of ill-advised moves, collaborating with the silky r&amp;b quartet 112 and the braying producer Lil Jon on tracks that defanged the Mobb's nihilist magnetism. Later still, the apparent final nail: Mobb Deep signed with G-Unit and released the dismal <em>Blood Money</em>, an album that tried to replace their gritty expressionism with vindicated new-money gloating. It failed colossally.</p><p>
    But six months later, there was Prodigy on YouTube, muttering hazy death threats over the nervous percussion-ripples and eerie bass-burbles of Edwin Starr's ""Easin' In"". With its harsh, grainy film-stock, the ""Mac 10 Handle"" video seemed miles removed from anything on the <em>Sucka Free Countdown </em>mixtape. It was the image of a once-great rapper tossing away his commercial ambitions and digging instead into what we loved him for in the first place. Prodigy maintains that grizzled intensity through the entirety of <em>Return of the Mac</em>, a stronger comeback than anyone would ever have guessed.</p><p>
<em>
    Return of the Mac</em> is just 10 songs and four interludes, and it's over in 40 minutes, barely half the length of the average major-label event-rap album. The beats all come from the New York-based producer and frequent Mobb collaborator Alchemist, whose intuitive chemistry with Prodigy makes for one of the most fruitful rapper-producer pairings in a while. Here, Alchemist creates a warm, organic bedrock for Prodigy's cold, weary monotone; in the producer's hands, the rapper's weathered crackle of a voice feels like a natural outgrowth of the landscape. Alchemist heavily samples the lush psychedelic soul of early-70s blaxploitation film soundtracks, wringing those weeping strings and disembodied moans for maximum pathos. Over those tracks, Prodigy's violent threats don't sound gratuitous; they become the commonsense warnings of a tired old gunslinger.</p><p>
    Over and over on <em>Return of the Mac</em>, Prodigy laments his own desensitization, constantly muttering variations on one theme: ""New York made me this way."" Success was never a great fit for P; a sufferer of sickle cell anemia, he always had a joyless bluntness in his voice even when he was celebrating his wealth, like the money in his pocket couldn't ease the pain in his bones. So the patient hardness he displays on this LP feels much more natural. Half the time, he doesn't even bother to rhyme, but his images still resonate: ""Have different colors leaking out you/ Like red, yellow, and white/ Got some stomach on your Nikes.""
    </p>
<p>
    Lyrically and musically, <em>Return of the Mac</em> feels like an immersion into a pre-Giulinani New York that may never have actually existed. Slowly, a lyrical picture emerges of the old, hard New York, a place
    where hopelessness leads to bad faith and violence. But as at home as he
    might be in the squalor, Prodigy never delights in it, lamenting
    instead: ""Niggas bodied JMJ right there in Queens/ Goes to show there's
    no respect for the OGs."" Alchemist's invocation of that era is entirely theoretical. The producer, after all, grew up white and privileged in Beverly Hills, first coming to prominence with the Whooliganz, the rap duo he formed as a teenager with James Caan's son Scott. But even if Alchemist's New York is a fantasy dystopia learned from old movies and rap records, it meshes perfectly with Prodigy's battered memories.</p><p>
<em>
    Return of the Mac</em> isn't a rehabilitation move for Prodigy; he neither flaunts nor denounces his G-Unit affiliation, and only makes occasional passing references to 50 Cent. What it is is the announcement of a stunning and unexpected late-career renaissance; Prodigy is tapping back into the fearsome frustration that once drove him. Amazingly, P originally conceived this piece of work-- the best thing he's done in well over a decade-- as a promotional mixtape, a quick move to build anticipation for <em>H.N.I.C. 2</em>, his official second solo album. ""This the mixtape; imagine how the album sound,"" he says on ""Stop Fronting"". But if the presumably more commercially aware <em>H.N.I.C. 2</em> is anywhere near as powerful as <em>Return of the Mac</em>, I'll be amazed. Again.

    unscheduled appearance at, of all places, the kids' pavilion. In front of an
    audience composed of half parents with children and half music critics, Smith
    chose to rail against Israel's then-raging bombing campaign in Lebanon. Poor
    judgment? Perhaps. But at 60, Smith remains every bit the firebrand she's
    always been, and as such she suffers no fools.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Yet all the same, her position as some high priestess of
    punk has long felt a little misplaced; she's more a punk by association than in
    practice. No musical radical, unlike many of her ready-to-raze peers, Smith's
    tastes were mostly classic rock and catholic. She may have hung with Tom
    Verlaine and Joey Ramone at CBGB's, but her musical heroes were Jimi Hendrix
    and Jim Morrison. It was ""Hey Joe"" on the A-side of her first single, not ""Piss
    Factory"", and the lead track of her debut <em>Horses</em>, infamously, was a
    career-defining take on Van Morrison's ""Gloria"". (And when that song was released as a single, its B-side was a cover of the Who's ""My
    Generation"".)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Hendrix and the Doors make appearances on <em>Twelve</em>, Smith's
    shockingly conservative 11th<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 9.16667px""></span> studio album, which comprises 12 mostly
    predictable covers and seems suspiciously timed to take advantage of Smith's
    recent induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (after seven straight
    years of being nominated). Cover albums can be more than the last refuge of the
    creatively bankrupt, but that takes some work and ingenuity. Yet several of
    these obvious songs are so iconic one wonders why Smith even bothered.
    </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Of course Smith loves ""Gimme Shelter""-- who doesn't? But why
    would anyone reach for Smith's version over the Stones', especially when Smith
    brings nothing new to a song whose original performance still drips with
    danger, menace and mystery? The same could be said for Jefferson Airplane's
    creepy bad-trip signifier ""White Rabbit"" or Hendrix's mystical ""Are You
    Experienced?"" As for the Doors' funky ""Soul Kitchen"", Smith could have learned
    a few lessons from X's version, approaching the original as a point of
    departure instead of as a template for a mostly sluggish tribute. The less said
    about what Smith does to Stevie Wonder's ""Pastime Paradise"" the better. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Sadly, nothing on <em>Twelve</em> is as
    intriguing as Smith's mournful cover of Prince's ""When Doves Cry"" (included on
    her 2002 collection ""Land""), though <em>Twelve</em>'s sole concession to anything
    that's happened in the past two decades-- a take on Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen
    Spirit""-- at least reinvents the song as a neo-bluegrass dirge (featuring longtime
    friend Sam Shepard; Flea and Verlaine guest elsewhere). Alas, it also proves its hoariest boomer cliché, the kind
    of thing you'd expect Smith to earnestly perform at Kurt Cobain's own 2014 Rock
    and Roll Hall of Fame induction. 
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    For that matter, only a pair of
    other songs even hail from the post-punk era, a head-scratching version of
    Tears for Fears' ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" (whose sweet,
    less-than-insistent rendition cancels the oft-overlooked seriousness of the
    lyrics) and Paul Simon's ""The Boy in the Bubble"" (a faithful shuffle, retaining
    the bounding Afro-pop groove of the original but little of the life, even if it
    features one of Smith's most playful and expressive vocals).
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The problem with <em>Twelve</em> isn't
    the staid song selection so much as this dogged insistence on staying faithful
    to the originals. Thus ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" stays (another)
    pleasant shuffle, and Neil Young's ""Helpless"" sounds exactly like something
    Young himself might play at one of his gigs. Across the board the readings are
    relatively straight and the performances proficient to the point of plodding.
    You know where each song is going before it gets there.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    The sole standout track that
    strays from the obvious comes, ironically, courtesy that most storied source of
    cover material, Bob Dylan. Yes, Dylan covers abound, but Smith at least chose
    the slightly more obscure mid-period ""Changing of the Guards"" from his <em>Street
    Legal</em> album. Her version strips away much of Dylan's late 70s cheese, even if
    the atmospheric rendition comes off like someone's been hitting the Neko Case
    pretty hard. Smith's ""Within You Without You"" similarly makes the most of one
    of the Beatles' more divisive songs, but the results are more interesting
    than actually compelling.
    </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
    Smith's comeback has been one of
    the most welcome and impressive of the reunion-rife post-grunge era. Her albums
    still seize, spark, and scream like Smith did at any of her scattered peaks. <em>Twelve</em>, on the other hand, is nothing but a big comedown, a placeholder in a
    career that's long been about soldiering forward, not stumbling backward. It's
    not an album to get lost in. It's an album you listen to once, then lose. It
    makes you long for another comeback, the sooner the better to redeem this
    pointless misstep.

    done with it, lads"" line on a band, the Rakes seem suddenly bereft of
    the punkish energy and instantly gratifying hooks that marked their
    early singles and debut album, <em>Capture/Release. </em>If you liked the quick fix of that record, or were intrigued by the
    ""All Too Human"" single (tacked onto that album's U.S. release), <em>Ten New Messages</em> is not the same kind of rush. The band saying this is ""not a concept album, but
    written around a theme"" should ring five-alarm bells for anyone who've
    followed their favorite musicians till they go right off the deep end
    of pretension. Funny thing is, the theme is probably the most
    interesting and well-executed part of <em>Ten New Messages</em>; it's the music that falls short.</p><p>
    Take ""Suspicious Eyes"", a song taking place on a tube ride that shifts between riders' paranoid perspectives to the point that they hand off the vocals to a tone-deaf  ""mother"" and a rapping Muslim. It's the same party-weary character tired out on <em>Capture/Release</em>, rubbing his eyes from a mid-week morning hangover, but now looking up and paying attention to the world around him (even if it's ultimately out of self-interest via self-preservation). As a concept, it's promising; as a song, it's tedious and awkward, lacking any strong melody or smooth transition between vocalists.</p><p>
    The band that old fans know isn't completely absent: ""The World Was a Mess But His Hair Was Perfect"" is a promising start, the same band as before with added pop detectability and more than a little cheek, a bubbling near-dance track with as many Doppler-effect keyboards as spidery guitar lines, all heeding that unrelenting single-note bass and the calm and assured disdain of singer Alan Donohoe. But save for isolated moments like ""Trouble"" or ""Time to Stop Talking"" later on, that cocksure swagger is nowhere to be found on <em>Ten New Messages</em>.  ""Little Supersitions"" is a limp breakup lament, and the mannered ""We Danced Together"" may earn them all those unfounded comparisons to early labelmates Bloc Party with its precise syncopation and the liberal  uses of ""oohs"" and ""ahhs."" The lyric occasionally shows an eye for detail (goosebumps on a paramour's arm provide an excuse to find warmer, more secluded corners),  but the Rakes seem ill-prepared to write a chorus spirited enough to match this cleaner, more accessible sound.
    </p><p>
    ""When Tom Cruise Cries"" follows this new blueprint and serves as a sort of centerpiece to the record, a seemingly never-ending throb where the protagonist awakes to CNN announcing ""electrical problems"" and proceeds to either panic or complain, depending on your perspective, about an unreachable significant other. On the way, it touches upon manipulative and fear-mongering media coverage and the unreality of celebrity's tears over a clipped counter-melodies and the sounds of cell phone interference. It takes the end of the album, with ""Leave the City and Come Home"", to make sounding defeated actually work, the guitars strumming insistently at half speed, but each breath of the vocals fall perfectly in line. (More of the first album's humor and distinctive detail being present here helps).
    </p>
<p>
    Again, this is interesting on paper. Is something truly dangerous afoot, or is it just more of what ""that French guy said,"" salacious and irresponsible media? Is his girl in trouble, or is he just getting the cold shoulder? Is our hero justified in running back home to the country in our culture of constant low-level paranoia, or is he just lacking the proper stones for city life? All the questions are there and presented clearly and without preaching, but nearly always over plodding chords that go nowhere. With keen observations and piles of swagger tucked away somewhere for the time being, the Rakes could still be the soundtrack to plenty of lives-- or at the very least, daily commutes-- if only they could find the strength to muster a smirk.

That's not to say the era of bands ripping musical ideas and fashion sense from the Cure, Smiths, and Duran Duran is anywhere near a close, but the Germans' bear-hug embrace of early 90s lo-fi and classic indie on debut <em>Cape Fear</em> sounds ahead of the hand-me-down curve.</p><p>
    Of course, there's a catch. Whereas aping, say, twitchy post-punk or shiny 80s pop initially felt somewhat novel for a lot of bands this decade, the novelty's pretty tenuous for the Germans, especially considering that the music they're recycling never really died out or became unhip. In fact, many of <em>Cape Fear</em>'s touchstones-- Pavement, Built to Spill, Modest Mouse, Sonic Youth-- remain forces to be reckoned with to this day, even if as a different incarnation. However, <em>Cape Fear</em> clearly evokes a particular period and style, as evidenced by a tinny song like ""Nature's Mouth"", where catchy lyrics espousing a slacker ethos evoke <em>Slanted &amp; Enchanted</em>-era Malkmus as markedly as Paul Banks first channeling Ian Curtis on ""Obstacle 1"".</p><p>
    On most tracks though, the band weaves together multiple influences rather than directly copping one style. Opener ""Tiger Vacuum Bottle"" alternates between a colossal Dinosaur Jr. jam and a meeker yet still punchy verse driven by early Modest Mouse octave riffs. Even if not wholly reflective of the band's sound, there are a lot of GbV moments on the record that feature big arena rock energy siphoned through a modest garage rock sound, such as the rallying cry chorus of ""Franchise"" or murky, mumbled vocals on ""M. Bison"".
    </p><p>
    While the Germans' material forfeits a lot in originality, they do attempt to imprint their own unique mark on their favorite sounds. Unfortunately, they try this by fusing synths, keyboards, and other electronic gadgets to the classic guitar, bass, and drums setup. While the occasional keyboard line doesn't hurt a song like ""No Job"", the cybernetic closer ""Brown's"" ends the album on a strange note, haphazardly meshing squawking vocals and xylophones reminiscent of I'm From Barcelona with a cheap drum loop and lazy synth lines. Blame the mixing by MSTRKRFT or just the general urge so many bands today have to use every gizmo in the studio, but <em>Cape Fear</em> devotes about two-thirds of its time establishing Germans as lo-fi retro-- a pretty dubious goal-- then pulls the rug out from under the listener with slapdash electroclash, essentially burying the time capsule immediately after exhuming it.

    Marfa, Texas is a place where landscape means everything and nothing. It's situated in the remote west of the state, three hours from an outpost airport serviced by the kind of small planes that swoop and shake as if tracking imaginary topography to counter the flatness below. It's in a harsh desert clime, a vast gasp of land between mountains gone green on one side and brown on the other.</p><p>
    There's a concrete sense of nothingness in Marfa that suited Donald Judd, an artist who served as a sort of West Texas ambassador. When he moved there from New York in the 1970s, Judd went to work framing a disquieting dialogue between ambition and defeat. He acquired an old military base and filled it full of boxes-- austere sculptures that created a sense of space where none had been before. His iconic boxes marked a highpoint of minimalism, and they remain both alien and attuned to their surroundings.</p><p>
    Sound-artist Stephen Vitiello is one of the many who have gone to Marfa to see. Judd died in 1994, but the Marfa he invented lives on. Art-tourists travel there to take in his work as he arranged it, and the lost town of 2,400 has become home to a Taschen-stocked bookstore where talk centers on the semiotics of squares. It's all strange and teeming, but Marfa is still remote enough to make such conversation sound like nothing.
    </p>
<p>
    Which is another way of saying it sounds like everything. Vitiello didn't literally sample such talk for <em>Listening to Donald Judd</em>, but it haunts his project just the same. The specs are simple: Vitiello wandered around Marfa and employed ""microsensors"" to make recordings he later processed to abstraction. He affixed some of them to Judd's sculptures; others found cues ""in a glider, in fields of grasshoppers and along some unknown street."" The resulting mix, split into six tracks, functions as a sort of metaphysical travelogue, a found-sound survey of a place more talked about than visited.
    </p>
<p>
    Or at least it's supposed to. The sound of a train is the album's only sound recognizable for what it is. The rest are all haunted and electronic, the kind of exploratory sine-waves and feedback that Vitiello has rubbed up for art museums and on an album with Scanner. They're sparse, subtle, oftentimes barely-there in terms of volume and shape.
    </p>
<p>
    The degree to which they serve their subject is an open question. None of the atmospheric sighs and scrapes ooze the kind of high-""musical"" reverence heard in, say, Morton Feldman's score for the Mark Rothko Chapel. But then, Judd was not Rothko. He was an artist whose aesthetic worked against fuzziness. His gestures were gestures of a different sort. By a likeminded metric, Vitiello's remoteness works as a tribute. His sounds summon the heaves and hums of the Marfa where Judd found peace-- a specific place where specificity meant everything and nothing at once.

    more bands than it's helped. For every Bruce Springsteen or Metallica, whose
    epic performances helped fuel massive record sales, there's been a Phish, whose
    cult-like concert experiences never quite convinced outsiders to shell out for more
    than tickets. You don't need to see the Hold Steady live to get what they
    do, but it helps. In person, at least the collective experience confirms that you're not
    the only one buoyed by the band's infectious nostalgia,
    boundless enthusiasm, outsized personalities, and monster riffs.</p><p>
    Fortunately for the Hold Steady, you get the loud, proud,
    gloriously unironic idea pretty well from their records. Live, the extra volume, stage moves, and
    banter only enhance the vibe the group's
    three records have offered and more or less perfected. Unfortunately, that rarely goes for live records as well, which almost never
    come close to capturing the experience of attending a show. That the Hold
    Steady nonetheless opted to release a live EP doesn't come as a surprise
    compared to the decision to release one of their infrequent acoustic sets.</p><p>
    Still, <em>Live at Fingerprints</em>-- recorded at a
    Long Beach in-store performance-- underscores something that's easily missed in the Hold
    Steady's recorded output: It's not the performances that make the band
    so special, it's the songs. Minus the amplification, and plus such un-rock'n'roll accoutrements as accordion and what may be a washboard, this handful of
    songs (mostly) from last year's <em>Boys and Girls in America</em> is a blast. Banter
    and all, it adds up to more than a souvenir or quick cash-in by showing the Hold
    Steady are far more versatile than some might give them credit for.
    </p><p>
    It certainly helps that Craig Finn's vocals are up-front and
    clear, easily made out with the din ratcheted down, the racket better suited to
    the back porch than the arena stage. Unlike many of rock's would-be poets, Finn
    doesn't take himself too seriously, but at the same time the conviction coursing
    through ""Cattle and the Creeping Things"" and the sentiments he's trying to
    convey come across as honest and heartfelt. And then there's the banter, where
    Finn and his bandmates (but mostly Finn) mock themselves with the same big-hug
    love with which they embrace rock history. 
    </p>
<p>
    Talking about the ""Chips Ahoy!"" video: ""We were playing this
    song in Costa Mesa, and it occurred to me that ""how am I supposed to know that
    you're high if you won't let me touch you' and 'how am I supposed to know that
    you're high when you won't let me dance' are two things I've said in real life,
    and it was to two different people."" On ""Citrus:"" ""All the best Led Zeppelin
    songs are about citrus fruit.""<span> </span>It
    makes you wish there was an indie-rock ""Storytellers"".
    </p>
<p>
    ""Citrus"", and the gentle take on ""You Can Make Him Like
    You"", would make Finn's sensitive hometown hero Paul Westerberg proud, as would
    the bluesy ""You Gotta Dance With Who You Came to the Dance With""-- and not just
    because it's a drinking reference, either. These songs, stripped to their bare emotions and sharp punchlines, capture the spirit of the left-behind, the guys and girls hanging out in the parking lot because they couldn't get into the sold-out show, kids awkwardly eyeing one another as they split a case of beer and
    talk about why they love the band they're not watching.<em> Live at Fingerprints</em> is essentially a quick taste of what those kids missed, and if there's a drawback to the disc it's that, at a scant five
    songs, the tease is over far too soon.

    At least they might not get lumped in with freak folk
    anymore. Backstory-rich Brooklyn duo CocoRosie brighten the sylvan hip-hop
    warble of their divisive earlier efforts with higher recording fidelity and
    Maurice Sendakian twee-pop instrumentation on their bloated third LP <em>The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn</em>,
    the most tellingly titled concept album since the Dandy Warhols imploded for 2005's
    <em>Odditorium or Warlords of Mars</em>. Don't
    worry, CocoRosie are still friends with
    Devendra Banhart, Icelandic guys who engineer Björk records, and other people much
    cooler than you.</p><p>
    Too bad it seems as if the more self-impressed CocoRosie sisters Bianca and Sierra
    Casady get about transcending genres, the less patience they have for mere
    mortal concerns like, um, songs. True, <em>Ghosthorse
    and Stillborn</em> begins with CocoRosie at their most radio-ready, on single
    ""Rainbowarriors"", where Bianca speak-sings impishly about finding
    ""the rainbow trail that's deep inside ya"" over beatbox schmaltz. It's something like Vitamin C's 1999 Top 40 hit ""Graduation (Friends
    Forever)"", only with neighing horses, buzzing synths, and Sierra's operatic
    soprano instead of Pachelbel-derived orchestral Radio Disney pomp/circumstance. Next, ""Promise"" is the record's most direct engagement with hip-hop,
    Bianca rapping about ""carry[ing] this carapace"" and ""burnt silver
    brushed lavender offspring"" with the unhurried flow of late-90s UK
    figures like Faithless emcees Rollo and Maxi Jazz. Think Joanna Newsom with shittier pot and nobody to edit her.</p><p>
    More often, though, <em>Ghosthorse
    and Stillborn</em> tends toward lazy, meandering nothings: The indecipherable
    music-box aria of ""Bloody Twins"", the babyish moocow soundscape of
    ""Black Poppies"", and the Banhart-penned piano moroseness of ""Houses"". (""Big houses burn down,"" Sierra sings to the rafters.) Finale ""Miracle"" features a simple ""I'll be your girl/ I'll be your boy"" refrain tailor-made for incoherent gender-theory theses. On
    spoken-word fragment ""Girl and the Geese"", an Antony-like male voice
    intones, ""As she did so, she turned into a geese/ It was then revealed that the other
    geese she magically had understood were once human like her,"" apparently under the influence of whichever drugs cause a grown man not to know the word ""goose."" I mean, it's never ""duck, duck, <em>geese</em>,"" is it? 
    </p>
<p>
    Alas, this album gets much, much worse. Bianca dons
    an unbearable Sebastian-the-singing-crab Jamaican accent for the loping
    harp-calypso of ""Japan"", in which she: 1) Steps into the Six Flags-length
    queue of weak singers who've seen fit to remind us ""life is like a
    rollercoaster,"" 2) Blithely parodies/paraphrases the Bobby Knight take on rape (i.e.,
    ""say, 'thank you!'""), 3) Offers some vapid chirps about the war in
    Iraq, and 4) Enjoins us, ""Everybody, just hold hands."" Sierra's
    classically trained vocal scales waft out of nowhere to interrupt the unholy
    proceeding, as if producer Valgeir Sigurðsson (Björk, Will Oldham) hit pause
    while walking past a university music building.
    </p>
<p>
    Despite the troupe's avant-garde raiment, CocoRosie's lyrics rarely get past art-school cliché. On
    ""Animals"", Bianca makes empty, free-associative leaps from the Mafia to
    porno to tobacco to ""a mini-disastro, bigger than the Ice Age/ Don't know
    if baby dinosaurs maybe could live through it/ Or Indians and butterflies/
    What's crushed is my spirit/ Oh, I fear it is too fragile.""
    </p>
<p>
    Father-conflicted ""Werewolf"" starts with a male voice describing a dream of being a werewolf, before Bianca
    proudly declares supposed shock'n'awe lines like ""I suck dick"" beside such trite juxtapositions as ""stains on my sheets and stains on
    my soul"" and lousy music writer words like ""coruscate."" Other
    people's dreams can be beautifully told, as in Michel Gondry films or Cocteau
    Twins LPs, but most of the time they're just boring: Some dude tells me he had a
    nightmare about his boss turning into a mule-hung Valkyrie (TMI, bro), and I'm
    all, yeah, let me tell you about the dream <em>I
    </em>had snorting sea monkeys with Billy Corgan. It takes craft to overcome this
    fundamentally human ""meh""; CocoRosie have ambition instead.<br/>

    Like perhaps many of us, the Crayon Fields are too young to
    have witnessed their musical heroes the first time around. Here the Melbourne, Australia
    quartet practically take pride in that fact, grasping the Beach Boys'
    ocean-flecked harmonies, the Zombies' dreamy eloquence, and the Association's
    gentle melodies, then making them sound even younger. Debut album <em>Animal Bells</em>-- released last year Down
    Under but not yet available stateside-- applies an artful naïve-pop aesthetic
    to yesterday's nuanced minor-key imaginings, with woozy falsetto, Byrdsian 12-string
    guitar, and eponymous toy bells.</p><p>
    The lighter side of the 1960s and 70s forms the album's
    foundation, with the AM-ready vocal reverb of the Clientele's <em>Suburban Light</em> as a starting point. Idyllic
    ""Back, Front, Side, Low, High"" entertains a twinkling guitar arpeggio
    from Chad &amp; Jeremy's ""Summer Song"".  Tremulous organs abound, from the
    tempo-shifting ""Would It Be So Strange?"" to the low-key boardwalk
    elegance of ""Drains"". Still, even as bespectacled singer/guitarist
    Geoff O'Connor murmurs, ""We're filling the potholes on your electric
    Rhodes,"" on understated ""Potholes"", chaotic guitar joins in with
    the cool clamor of the Velvet Underground's ""What Goes On"".</p><p>
    The Crayon Fields can also be as twee as Brian Wilson, if
    not the Boy Least Likely To. On iTunes, <em>Animal Bells </em>comes up as
    ""children's music."" The mid-2005 addition of multi-instrumentalist Chris
    Hung helped the band embrace bells, glockenspiel, and other kid-friendly instrumentation,
    after two early EPs drew comparisons to Pavement. With backing vocals by
    members of underrated Aussie indie-poppers Minimum Chips, ""Lovely
    Time"" evokes the atmospheric repetitions of Miami's the Postmarks, only fuzzy-wuzzier. O'Connor sings about handclaps on handclap-laden ""Impossible Things"", while 
    ""Living So Well"" is a boy/girl duet worthy of early Camera Obscura.  The Crayon Fields cloak their songs in chiming,
    puppy-dog cuteness the way other bands use noise. 
    </p>
<p>
    ""Child is the father of the man,"" Wilson sang (long before
    the Alfonso Cuarón film). <em>Animal Bells</em>
    shows the Crayon Fields bringing out the casually childlike in their
    forefathers. Standout ""Helicopters"" merges the band's sense of play with their sense of history amid swirling synthesizer, acoustic jangle, and lyrical visions of a blue,
    heavenly sky. ""I want to be famous, gee,"" O'Connor bashfully admits
    on the closing track. For an album like <em>Animal Bells</em>, it'd be pretty shitty to begrudge him.

What if the Arctic Monkeys didn't care about street cred and signed to a major instead of trying to keep it real on Domino? What if Pete Doherty spent less time doing crack and more time getting high on the fact that he gets to have sex with Kate Moss? What if Louis XIV weren't quite as terrible as you correctly remembered them to be? And, in the pantheon of iPod pitchmen bands, will the Fratellis be the next Jet or just the next Caesars?</p><p>
<em>Costello Music</em> makes the search for these answers an intermittently rewarding if ultimately inconsequential task. Though fond of the double-timed rave-ups and streetlight serenades that form the genetic code for post-Libertines, UK guitar-rock bands, the faux-fraternal Fratellis aren't so much the sound of young Britain as the sound of dad's old record collection. Cataloging a lover's spat on ""For the Girl"", frontman Jon Fratelli explains she ""she was into the Stones, I was into the Roses,"" but his band's traditionalist pub rock makes you wonder why the girl's preference for the geezers would be such a thorny issue. In pop pin-up terms, the Fratellis are the Slade to Pete Doherty's Bowie-- artless but amiable lunkheads with a knack for sloshed choruses and making cheap jokes out of bad spelling (""Cuntry Boys &amp; City Girls""). Though 98% of their songs are about getting/losing girls, the Fratellis are more like horny but harmless schoolboys than dirtbag lotharios, more mischievous than malicious.</p><p>
    The best songs here are front-loaded: The platform-booted glam stomp of ""Chelsea Dagger"", the obligatory Ray Davies-styled strummer (""Whistle for the Choir""), and if the iPod-commercial overload of ""Flathead"" makes you want to ba-da-ba-ba-da-bash your TV set with a baseball bat, at least stick around for the part you don't hear in the advert, when Jon suddenly turns into Jerry Garcia for the trippy outro guitar solo. But the Fratellis are a decent singles band working overtime here-- though no song breaks the four-minute mark, there's still 13 of them to wade through, and most are beholden to a predictable pattern of hop-along verse and overexcited amped-up chorus, while the attempts to toughen up their eager-to-please power-pop with bluesy prowls (""Doginabag"") and hoarse-throat punky aggression (""Got Ma Nuts From a Hippy"") are far less engaging.</p><p>
<em>Costello Music</em>'s passable hit/miss ratio isn't enough to suggest the Fratellis can usurp the Monkeys or, heck, even the View as Britain's consummate people's band, but for about 12 minutes here they corner an oversaturated market for good-time, no-worries, low-calorie  rock'n'roll meant to be blasted in cramped, smoky environments where people still play darts. After all, it's no coincidence this band's shorthand is the Frats, right?</p></div>"|10105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10105-costello-music/|5.5|Stuart Berman

    Idlewild is a band living at the right time. Every one of
    their five albums so far has been stuffed with filler, but amidst all that
    filler there have always been between two and five standout tracks of melodic,
    literate sad-boy guitar pop worth an iTunes download or a place on an indie-friendly-drama soundtrack. They're not so much making
    another world on their fifth album as they are revising R.E.M.'s world,
    but it's a formula that's worked for them since that Gertrude Stein song (as
    most people know ""Roseability"") established their pop chops almost 10 years
    ago.</p><p>
    The Scottish group actually took something of a step
    backward on its last album, 2005's overly sedate <em>Warnings/Promises</em>, after coming into its own on <em>The Remote Part</em> in 2002. <em>Make Another World</em> seems as though it's
    trying to make up the lost ground. ""If It Takes You Home"" feels like an
    advertisement for the band's more overtly rock credentials: The song's crunching guitars can't quite
    smother vocalist Roddy Woomble completely, but it's not for lack of trying, and the singer saves it with his verse melody and a workmanly chorus.</p><p>
    That song's sequencing right before ""Future Works"" shows the band's range, as the latter song is a pensive,
    horn-dappled march, roughly the equivalent of a ballad for a band that doesn't
    really write ballads. It's something of a descendent of the group's ""American English"", but
    where that song willed itself to become an anthem, this one seems to get
    distracted by its instrumentation, preferring to trail off and let the horns
    bring it to an anticlimactic, if pretty, conclusion. 
    </p>
<p>
    So where are the standouts? Well, by my count there are
    three: two at the beginning and one at the end. Closer (before the bonus tracks
    on the U.S.
    version) ""Finished It Remains"" captures a bit of that ""we're all in this
    together"" sweep the band's best songs always have. Back at the front end, opener
    ""In Competition for the Worst Time"" is hobbled by the processing on Woomble's
    voice, but the third and fourth tracks deliver on its tease. The title track
    makes you wait for the big chorus, throwing a big guitar figure at you after
    the first pumping verse instead, but the wait is worth it. ""No Emotion"" is the
    show-stopper, though. It's arguably the danciest thing Idlewild has ever done,
    and Colin Newton's hi-hat abuse drives it straight into your head. The song is
    basically all chorus, with backing vocals providing extra hookage.
    </p>
<p>
    What Idlewild can't be accused of is complacency or
    laziness-- they obviously feel every note here, but it doesn't always hit home
    for the listener. Idlewild are either going to come through with a truly
    amazing record some day or release a really awesome ""best of"" comp sometime
    around 2010-- either way, their best songs are undeniable. The rest isn't bad,
    but a lot of <em>Make Another World</em>
    doesn't stick the way good guitar pop should.

    At this time last year, London three-piece Klaxons had barely
    finished self-decorating their first 7"", ""Gravity's Rainbow"". By
    June, they were at the HMV buying their second single, the William Burroughs-invoking ""Atlantis
    to Interzone"". Soon the band found themselves headlining the <em>NME</em>'s Indie Rave tour in support of a UK #2 album, the day-glo lit-geek princelings
    of a ginned-up ""movement"" they swiftly disavowed. A little backlash
    was to be expected, sorry.</p><p>
    And yet Klaxons are only the most recent manifestation of
    the British rock press' perennial compulsion to rediscover the very stuff it stereotypically
    ignores, dance music. Screeching production
    courtesy of Simian Mobile Disco's James Ford distinguishes the group's
    full-length debut, <em>Myths of the Near
    Future</em>, from British indie's recent trad blokeness. However, Klaxons
    singer/bassist Jamie Reynolds &amp; co. aren't reviving the house and rave music actually heard during the UK's 1988 ""Second Summer of Love"", though <em>Myths </em>definitely owes a debt to the bands who translated that sound for
    guitars: the baggy-trousered likes of the Stone Roses, Primal Scream, and Happy
    Mondays. Instead, the strength of a few stellar songs in this 12-track set
    establishes Klaxons primarily as...one more catchy English guitar-pop group.
    Glowsticks, like last week's ""angular"" guitars, be damned.</p><p>
    The singles that built Klaxons' rep overseas-- re-recorded
    here in slightly more cluttered form-- make no shortage of dancefloor gestures.
    Then again, neither did fellow <em>NME</em>-proclaimed
    rock saviors Arctic Monkeys, at least lyrically, with 2005's ""I Bet You Look Good on a Dancefloor"";
    on the Arctics' forthcoming album they, too, opt for the Ford production treatment. Though Alex Turner's dancefloor exhortations were
    essentially confined to words, Klaxons turn for their frantic pulse to the clattering rock rhythm sections of
    guitar-based New York
    club-dabblers from ESG to the Rapture. Klaxons' two-part, falsetto-sweetened ""Gravity's
    Rainbow"" chorus belies its high Pynchon brow, popping pills that
    !!! forgot to leave in Giuliani's schoolhouse for Bloc Party to pick up after their recent Washington Heights stop. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    On ""Atlantis to Interzone"", the literal ""klaxon""
    warning bleats that give the song its ""nu-rave"" cachet-- among
    provincial English teens, anyway-- basically deflect attention from soused
    guitar scribbles that wouldn't be out of place on the latest Arctics single.
    Anyway the Rakes, Franz Ferdinand, and Hard Fi all know those same disco hi
    hats. Meanwhile, the electropunk scream'n'stomp of Aleister Crowley paean ""Magick""
    is less memorable than its accompanying hypestorm, in retrospect. ""Golden
    Skans"", which alludes to the album's eponymous story collection by
    British author J.G. Ballard, floats on keyboards not at all ill-suited for Paris's Ed Banger
    Records-- which also released the track. Or another French label, Kitsuné,
    which released a totally great Van She remix of ""Gravity's Rainbow"".
    </p>
<p>
    So, nevertheless, looking for a sequel to Daft Punk's <em>Discovery</em>? Seek elsewhere, fellow
    pilgrims. With a magnificent wordless vocal hook, ""Skans"" comes
    closer to guitar pop like the fatalistic Smiths of ""A Rush and a Push
    and the Land Is Ours"" than the filter disco of Ed Banger phenoms Justice. Wobbly
    B-movie lead guitar on ""As Above, So Below"" recalls Graham Coxon's
    buggiest glam-rock updates, and the macabre harmonies and bouncy groove of
    ""Forgotten Works"" aren't all that disparate from <em>13</em>-era Blur, down to the deep-background howls-- Americans tend to
    forget Blur started as fundamentally a clever indie-dance band. Fact is, Klaxons are
    turning techno cognoscenti onto UK
    indie rock much more than vice versa. Many natural Klaxons listeners probably
    wouldn't recognize the Eurodance roots of ""It's Not Over"", a 90s hit on multiple occasions for various Paul Oakenfold projects. The <em>Myths</em> dance-rockers reshape the song as
    dreamy post-Stone Roses indie dance, shrill siren noises the biggest hint at
    its origins.   <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Klaxons' lyrical pretensions, alas, can be a reminder why
    the best house and trance music often emphasizes atmosphere over meaning. Where
    the Arctics focus on quotidian English life,
    Reynolds prefers to sing of Cyclopes, unicorns, and seven-volume Marcel Proust masterpiece
    <em>À la recherche du temps perdu</em>, in
    addition to the litany of literary references already mentioned above. At least
    jagged closer ""Four Horsemen of 2012"" finds humor in its snobbery,
    with its slogan of ""Klaxons, not centaurs!"" Elsewhere, for every
    evocative line about whippoorwills ""turn[ing] east toward Westphalia""
    there's a ""Serebella sitting on the totum timeline"" while
    ""hangmen also die, in famagusta's hive"" (amid the DFA-like dance-punk
    of ""Totem on the Timeline""). I thought we were supposed to be having
    fun? <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Most of the time, we are. And we do: Klaxons' full-throttle
    racket can be very convincing on that point. <em>Myths</em> is a reminder that, though the UK rock press's relationship
    with dance music can be Byzantine, hyberbolic, and endlessly offputting, plenty
    of young UK bands continue to record fine pop songs-- whatever their subgenre
    affiliation. Klaxons are just a band, the English sage/emcee Scroobius Pip
    would surely remind us. Shit, yeah, and they're one well worth hearing.

    Brian Wilson and Avril Lavigne have made me cry. Albert Ayler
    has given me a panic attack. But only Throbbing Gristle have made me
    puke. A few years ago, while listening to their 1980 album <em>Heathen Earth</em>, I lost a full day's worth of food. I can't help but think the band's four members would giggle at that very organic response to the metal machine music that used scrap parts (cornets
    played like electric guitars, electric guitars played like electrified
    hamburger, electronics played like squirting blood and semen) to see just how
    far rock and pop could be distended.</p><p>
    Throbbing Gristle's muse was the pit that
    grows in your stomach when you're frightened, and since dread and unease were
    what they had to work with-- rather than hooks and melodies-- they learned to play with them as
    assuredly as Holland-Dozier-Holland. Now, 25 years after hanging up their Gristlizers,
    the curtain goes up on the band's excellent second act, <em><span style=""font-style: italic"">The Endless Not</span></em>, bringing TG
    into the post-industrial world of 2007 without sucking their sick-making
    psychodrama into the song-free vacuum of modern avant-garde electronica or
    extreme noise.</p><p>
    Lotta black water has flowed under the Death Factory since 1982-- too much to recount in a record review-- but while this older Gristle may have traded the analog animal groans of Chris Carter and Sleazy Christopherson's homemade electronic black boxes for ""sampled sounds,"" the TG writ remains intact. On the <em>The Endless Not</em>, the grunts and cries of corrupted digital matter are made to sound animalistic, animistic, aleatory, and antagonistic. The heavy current of magical dread and performance art provocation that runs through all of those hundreds of hours of TG live tapes snakes here through the band's samplers as well. But you can hear the digital difference from the opening track, ""Vow of Silence"", where TG frontman Genesis Breyer P-Orridge's shivers and sobs are serrated by computer editing tools and sent stuttering and blurting against pixelated gasps and blasts and Carter's caveman rhythm programming, all ready for looping at your local sanitarium.
    </p>
<p>
    But P-Orridge's soiled singing is the record's most uncomfortable link to the human world, a rusty brown <em>Rumours</em> of lovesick depression and alienation, and the primary element separating the <em>The Endless Not</em> from a modern noise scene more interested in Dadaistic collisions than perverted Tin Pan Alley. On ""Almost a Kiss"", P-Orridge sounds like Robert Wyatt at the bottom of a bottle or the end of a rope, his creaking moans-- ""you fit me like a shrunken glove""-- driven by a deeply uncomfortable neediness and desperation, the voice of someone who needs a restraining order.
    </p>
<p>
    The album's eeriest and most sonically improbable track is ""Rabbit Snare"", using their new digital tech to force together melancholy Bill Evans-style piano, sinister brushed drums from some demonic supperclub, dying seagull cries from Cosey Fanni Tutti's cornet, and watery organ and clavinet from 70s fusion, with P-Orridge's sinister crooning, as if he's lying on the forest floor with his own paw caught in the trap, taking this toxic ballad to places beyond electro-acoustic abstraction. Far from cartoon provocation or fascist transgression, <em>The Endless Not</em> features some of the subtlest songwriting of TG's career, playing that knot of tension for all it's worth and all the more disturbing for how pensive and restrained it feels. <em>The Endless Not</em> hasn't made me throw up yet, but I still probably won't play it in the dark.

    Numero Group's estimable Eccentric Soul series has always
    searched for worthy blips that never made it onto the popular radar, uncovering tales of failure that are often more compelling than the success stories that
    overshadowed them in their day. So at first glance Twinight seems like a
    strange fit-- you can't call yourself a soul enthusiast without knowing at least
    a little about the label. Twinight charted eight singles during its brief run
    in Chicago from the late 1960s into the early 70s, but a more detailed look
    reveals that seven of those were by Syl Johnson, and the 47 Twinight 45s that
    didn't sniff the chart remain almost hopelessly obscure.</p><p>
    The imprint's inability to score other hits wasn't
    down to a lack of quality so much as a distracted ownership-- label heads Howard
    Bedno and Peter Wright were more concerned with their radio promotion business; the label was such a side project, they forgot to
    incorporate it under its first name, Twilight. The discovery that the name was
    already taken led to the minor tweak that gave us the label we thought we knew.
    There's no question that with Johnson in the fold, Bedno and Wright had a
    major talent at their disposal, as evidenced by hits like ""Come
    On, Sock It to Me"" and the epochal one-two of ""Is it Because I'm Black"" and
    ""Concrete Reservation"".</p><p>
    The Numero guys went all-out for this comp, stuffing 40
    prime Twinight non-hits onto two CDs, and it's a diverse bunch of songs.
    Twinight straddled the transition from soul to funk, and you get plenty of
    both, with a dash of psychedelia thrown in for good measure. There are also harmony
    groups that would've slotted comfortably next to the Temptations and the Four
    Tops if they could've obtained the airplay. The Notations, who had the label's
    only non-Syl charter with ""I'm Still Here"" (not on this comp), check in with a pair of outstanding slices of brass-slathered harmony funk-- the
    success of other track here, ""Lonely People"", may have been hampered
    somewhat by the fact that it lifts the horn part from Spiral
    Starecase's ""More Today Than Yesterday"".
    </p>
<p>
    The Dynamic Tints are another group that could've been huge
    under the right circumstances. Their collaborations with Pieces of Peace, a
    funk band that played on a ridiculous number of sessions all over Chicago, are astounding
    psychedelic soul workouts in the Norman Whitfield mode. ""Rosemarie"" is
    especially mind-blowing, busting in with biting fuzz guitar and alternating
    trade-off verses with sweetly harmonized choruses that rub surprisingly well
    against the clattering funk rhythm section. It's hard to imagine a harmony
    group in that era not being at least a bit influenced by the Tempts, and the
    Kaldirons' ""You &amp; Me Baby"" could be mistaken for a late-period Eddie
    Kendricks track if you weren't listening too closely. 
    </p>
<p>
    The label had short-lived relationships with a load of
    talented solo singers as well. Johnny Williams' ""Breaking Point"" has long been
    one of my favorite early 70s funky soul workouts, and it's nice to hear its
    wild and wiry lead guitar and thundering horn arrangement with such vibrantly
    remastered sound. John Colley, who cut one of the label's first singles under
    the name Stormy, exudes effortless cool on 1967's ""the Devastator"" as he
    self-mythologizes over a proto-funk backing track. Velma Perkins, recorded by
    the label as a favor to her brother, DJ Al Perkins, in an example of what Bedno
    and Wright called ""friend-ola,"" gets her first wide release under that name
    here-her ""Yes, My Goodness, Yes"" and ""I'll Always Love You"" were originally
    pressed in absurdly small quantities that barely qualify as a proper release.
    ""My Goodness"" in particular rips, with frenetic drumming and melodic, Stax-y
    guitar breaks backing up Perkins' pleading vocal.
    </p>
<p>
    Listening in the relative vacuum of the modern day, forty
    years removed from the events, it's hard to imagine all this music tanking so
    badly. The compilation takes its name from the old DJ term (back when DJs
    actually chose songs) for the graveyard timeslots when just about anything
    could get played provided the right person handed it to the guy at the
    turntable. For guys who were so adept at pushing things past the lunar rotation
    into the realm of hits, it's amazing how little success Bedno and Wright had
    breaking their very own records, especially when they were this good. This
    music hasn't been unearthed so much as restored to its rightful place in the
    light of day, and it makes this one of the strongest entries in possibly the
    very best ongoing soul reissue series out there.

    It's nearly impossible not to like the fourth UK single from Noisettes' debut <em>What's the Time, Mr. Wolf?</em>, ""Sister Rosetta (Capture the Spirit)"".  On it, or perhaps through it, singer Shingai Shoniwa channels the woman many consider to be one of the first guitar heroes of rock'n'roll.   Sister Rosetta Tharpe was not only a gospel singer and lead guitarist of a music group, but a black woman.  That her story is depressingly reserved to the dustbin of history, as a footnote rather than a minor miracle, is a tragedy.   Like Tharpe, Shoniwa is a walking panopoly of cultural signifiers; an axe-wielding black frontwoman of a rock group.   And like so many of her white male forerunners have done, Shoniwa pays tribute to her unrecognized hero, and offers a corrective for a half-century of popular ignorance. ""Rosetta"" should-- and to a degree has-- gained the London trio a measure of notice on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>
    But not, however, to the extent of Shoniwa herself. A direct descendant of Grace Jones, with elements of Poly Styrene from X-Ray Spex and Ari Up of the Slits, and evoking contemporaries Karen O and Gwen Stefani in equal measure, Shoniwa has a fashion model's appearance and sense of style as performance. She bedecks herself with facepaint and hairstyles suggesting a new-wave warrior princess, and has a spastic, energetic stage presence. <em>Wolf</em> is her showcase, clear and true, and its greatest impression left comes from the mixture of simple, engergetic rallying cries like ""Don't Give Up"", ""Scratch Your Name"", and ""Nothing to Dread"", and the sort of tentative romantic vulnerability only acquired through real-life experience. ""Bridge to Canada"" alternates between Shoniwa missing her ""sweet pea"" on tour, before wishing ""you'd fall but not drown,"" and ""The Count of Monte Christo"" warns exhaustedly that ""there's no more honey from this bee."" For its part, ""IWE"" is an escapist fantasy that merges the album's emotional poles: ""You take your jump I'll make my leap/ Feel freedom coming, we can have it all.""</p><p>
    As a first full-length, <em>Wolf</em> harbors a kineticism and untapped potential that could hint at much better things to come. Shoniwa strives to inject furious passion into every second of the record, but too often she and her sidemen seem burdened by the need to shoehorn their ideas into the rigid confines of genre, especially glossy garage-blues and squeaky Ani DiFranco-style folk.  One can only imagine what could be in store if they decide to more fully explore a more inventive, polyrhythmic rock fusion (as another trio displayed on last year's wonderful <em>Show Your Bones</em>) that seems to be their calling.  While Shoniwa has a bit of distance to travel to reach the creative level of her iconoclastic forerunners and inventive contemporaries, <em>Wolf</em> is a fine debut showcase of what could lie ahead for her. Including the inevitable solo career, of course. <br/>

    The songs on 31Knots' fifth full-length are superficially interesting
    because of their instrumental or lyrical barrages and clever production;
    frontman Joe Haege writes about the daily rat race or dogmatic defeat and
    sounds like Zach de la Rocha rooming with Cedric Bixler in college. But it gets
    boring fast: The 11 songs on <em>The Days and
    Nights</em> come in different outfits, all covering the same thin,
    half-baked, post-grad body concerned with how done society is or how over
    people Haege is. The musical inspiration is clear. Note the Shipping News hyper-rhythm of ""The Salted
    Tongue"" and the cabaret punk of ""Savage Boutique"", or the June
    of 44 vibraphones of ""Everything in Letters"" and the piano pleading
    of ""Pulse of a Decimal"". Still, hear 'em all several times and all
    that sticks are meaningless twists of phrase, vocal over-exacerbation, and
    instrumental dexterity that doesn't know tantalization from taste.</p><p>
    If <em>The Days and Nights </em>has one
    underlying fault, it's that nothing about it feels personal or developed
    enough. Haege and his trio understand song structure and movement, but
    everything about the 11 tracks here feels either clever or finished by half.
    Lyrically, Haege trades the specificities of his experiences for the vagaries
    of his condescending commentary, telling us what he thinks about everything
    instead of showing us he has a reason to know <em>anything</em>.
    He writes songs without handlebars. He frames those laments in first person,
    but it sounds more like he's preaching than pleading. Haege's voice is <em>always </em>at a full melodramatic tilt, too,
    the sound of a man safe in a studio as he tells us how we should be. Do lines
    like ""Walk between the raindrops for a dollar a day/ It's tragic you're so
    tardy or just fashionably late/ A savage in surrender with vicious intent""
    actually compel anyone, even when shouted?</p><p>
    Still, even for a band that's chomping at the social bit, they've made a
    record that's remarkably normal. Though they sample Archie Shepp and Beethoven
    on one track (without much purpose), they also hack standard scales for
    long-winded instrumental excursions (see ""The Salted Tongue"", which
    also includes a drum solo) and conclude the record with an ""epic""
    track that's subdivided between equal noise and big, distended harmonies
    ready-made for an outro. <em>The Days and Nights</em>
    is a least-common denominator indie rock album, borrowing cues from the last
    two decades of things you've probably loved. If Haege would just fess up and
    stop telling us he's ""assassin of the reason you want to exist,"" it
    would be a bit more bearable. It would also help if the band would stop
    depending on production for making songs sound different.

After the multi-platinum bloodletting <em>The Downward Spiral</em>
    exploded in 1994, the depressive frontman froze, stuck in a drug-addled
    mindfuck of heightened expectations. And while he took eons deciding whether he
    wanted to be the next ""voice of a generation,"" a fickle pop zeitgeist
    passed Nine Inch Nails by. Ten years and just one (insular, commercially toxic)
    album later, 2005's <em>With Teeth</em> had Reznor turning familiar tricks while desperately groping
    for the mass adulation of old. But, even by regressive NIN standards, the album was too lock-step, causing die-hards to question
    their favorite troubled teen trapped inside a 40-year-old brute's body. ""A
    lot of what I've done as Nine Inch Nails has been governed by fear,""
    admitted the singer two years ago, and <em>With Teeth</em> sounded like the product of a
    man paralyzed by his looming cultural expiration date.</p><p>
    But something clicked while Reznor
    &amp; co. toured the world over the past couple of years-- he learned to stop
    worrying about MTV and love the cult. When I saw the band on Long
    Island last summer, they were riveting, raged, and refreshed.
    Brutally aggressive yet artfully dramatic, the performance was anything but staid;
    it got me genuinely excited about NIN for the first time in ages.
    And apparently, the tour got Reznor amped too. A mere two years after his latest full-length (a mere blip on the NIN timeline) comes <em>Year Zero</em>, a disquieting
    apocalyptic vision largely recorded on the road. The songs still deal
    with Reznor's tried-and-true topics-- including the destructive powers of addiction, religion, and authority-- but the record's framework is new. Instead of just
    chronicling his own fatalistic tendencies, this time Reznor is taking on the entire
    world's hastening downward spiral.</p><p>
    It's not the most original
    dystopian yarn. An amalgam of ideas taken from no-future tales like <em>1984</em>, <em>The Matrix</em>, and <em>The Wall</em>,
    <em>Year Zero</em> takes place on a scorched earth 15 years from today:
    The war on terror has escalated into a full-blown fanatical religious struggle,
    the American people are sedated by government-sanctioned drugs with names like
    Parepin and Opal, and a violent underground resistance movement is trying to
    usurp the totalitarian U.S.
    regime. It's a perfect shitstorm for Reznor to do what he does best: depict ceaseless
    brutality with the tactless force of a bunker buster.
    </p><p>
    But instead of leaving it
    up to the listener to fill in the nameless pronouns and vague themes within
    <em>Year Zero</em>, he's hired Alternate Reality Game experts to help him concoct a
    sprawling hypertext scavenger hunt aimed squarely at obsessives. The online
    game's unabashed intricacies reiterate Reznor's new appreciation for his
    smaller, devout fanbase: There's no way a casual fan can could hope to keep
    track of the myriad hidden websites, endless message board speculation, and spectrograph
    analysis (seriously) required to crack <em>Year Zero</em>'s expanded storyboard. Thankfully,
    none of that knowledge is necessary to enjoy the album's combustible backdrops.  
    </p>
<p>
    Low on anthemic hooks and heavy on
    riotous noise breaks, <em>Year Zero</em> finds Reznor waving his digital hardcore flag
    high. Instead of wallowing in monotonous refrains as he did on <em>With Teeth</em> and parts of <em>The Fragile</em>,
    Reznor offers Bomb Squad-meets-Merzbow sonic blasts on tracks like
    ""Vessel"", ""My Violent Heart"", and especially the apocalypse-now back-end of ""The Great Destroyer""; these fuzz buckets double as yellow caution tape for all ""Hurt""-loving passerbys. The album's ever-mutating drums and off-kilter
    arrangements show this plug-in wonk is still a master programmer. Then there are the words, which remain somewhat less than masterful. But, for every repetitive mention of
    ""down on your knees"" submission and corrosive godheads (there are
    many), <em>Year Zero</em> squeezes out some intriguing ambiguities.
    </p>
<p>
    Though it's clear Reznor favors the
    anti-establishment warriors in his invented battle-earth, he offers multiple
    sides to the story-- and even some shades of gray between good and evil.
    There's the torn military man at the center of ""The Good Soldier"" who's trying to believe his actions are just (""God is on my side/ I keep
    telling myself""), the apathetic bystander who only asks ""can we
    stop?"" when it's too late on ""Me, I'm Not"", and voices
    representing god-complex propaganda from both government (""The Greater
    Good"") and anti-government (""My Violent Heart"") players. The
    set-up hides Reznor behind his characters to an extent, but lines like, ""Don't
    try to tell me how some power can corrupt a person/ You haven't had enough to
    know what it's like,"" from the broad  anti-Bush swipe ""Capital G"", could also
    describe the deadening corruption he himself faced by-way-of fame and drugs
    once upon a time. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    In 1996, Reznor told <em>Spin</em>, ""The idea of politics is
    just so uninteresting to me-- I don't believe things can really change. It doesn't
    matter who's president."" Now more mature and sober, he's finally aware of the world around him-- and, not surprisingly,
    he's not too pleased. While <em>Year Zero</em> gets bogged down in stock
    themes, 2-D imagery, and the occasional too-long come-down, its cult-ready appeal is pure. The
    fan-artist communion reaches a peak on the post-doomsday finale,
    ""Zero-Sum"", a welcome addition to the lofty tradition of NIN album-closing
    ballads. ""And I guess I just wanted to tell you,"" says Reznor in a
    conspiratorial whisper, ""As the light starts to fade/ That you are the
    reason/ That I am not afraid."" It's the
    end of the world as he knows it, and he feels (relatively) fine.
