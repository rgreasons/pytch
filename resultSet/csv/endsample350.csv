For the psych-dabblers (who celebrate their tenth birthday this year), this could have been the mantra all along. Following on from their debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6596-dins/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dins</i></a>, they spent the next decade playing with different sounds and approaches, all loosely based around a fairly cosmic aesthetic. Where that album was new age-y with great pop impulses, follow-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9770-early-violence/"" target=""_blank""><i>Early Violence</i></a> was a left turn into murky, minimalist post-punk. The all-improv <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12646-mirror-eye/"" target=""_blank"">Mirror Eye</a> </i>was a messy, often intolerable stretch of raga drones. 2011's aptly titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15984-psychic-ills/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hazed Dream</i></a>, their first for New York imprint <a href=""http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sacred Bones</a>, toyed with bluesy Eastern psychedelia. They've never really had a compass, and while the same school of thought has sometimes benefitted bands of their ilk in very exciting ways, it's often left Psychic Ills' catalogue looking lopsided.</p>
<p>Their latest effort, <i>One Track Mind</i>, is yet another diversion, and one that couldn't have been predicted. Though most closely resembling <i>Hazed Dream</i>, <i>One Track Mind</i> is the most straightforward album Psychic Ills have ever made, offering 10 tracks that sound like they were all found along the same stretch of desert highway. Some of this is likely down to the presence of Neil Hagerty (of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2031-the-howling-hex/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">the Howling Hex</a>, and formerly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Royal Trux</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_Galore_%28band%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pussy Galore</a>), who contributes backing vocals and produced a couple songs. While<i> One Track Mind</i> is unlikely to be mistaken for the work of a different band (though it's uncannily like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/378-black-rebel-motorcycle-club/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Black Rebel Motorcycle Club</a> in parts), its unexpected clarity of vision and execution makes it arguably their best album since <i>Early Violence</i>, though the rewards aren't great.</p>
<p>Psychic Ills have always been more concerned with establishing feel and atmosphere over general songcraft, and here they just about manage to bridge the gap. Almost every track features similar components-- rippling, melty guitars, country jangle, hints of desert mirage psychedelia-- alternating between tempos that are either morphine drip-slow or a more sinister boogie. The songs with more step are the most memorable, like ""Depot"", its grislier tone coming off genuinely, potently sexy. ""FBI"" and (more successfully) ""Western Metaphor"" stand out thanks to the added funk, both blistered and blazed.</p>
<p>Psychic Ills' Achilles' heel is still in plain view, as much of <i>One Track Mind</i> is simply quite dull. It's a pretty repetitive listen thanks to the unvarnished structure of these songs, but what really drags things down is a lack of necessary drama. A howling guitar on ""See You There"" brings some welcome fire and brimstone, but mostly emphasizes the dynamic void elsewhere. The shout-along chorus of ""Might Take a While"" should feel like a sinner's testimony, but comes across limp. The same can be said for Tres Warren's weightless vocals throughout.</p>
<p>Considering the band's taste for zoning out to infinity, <i>One Track Mind</i> really needed a harsher edit. With some tightening and pruning, it could have burst into bloom. A decade in, much of that spent in the shadow of peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Black Dice</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Gang Gang Dance</a>, it's heartening that Psychic Ills are still exploring new avenues, though they rarely punch above their weight.</p></div>"|17661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17661-psychic-ills-one-track-mind/|6.0|Zach Kelly

There was a time when Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, was often referred to as the ""pearl of the Indian Ocean."" Before dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991 and the country plunged into civil war, it was a beautiful, cosmopolitan city with the nightlife and bands to soundtrack it. Today, it's a scarred place under persistent threat from the country's still-powerful religious militias and al-Shabaab suicide bombers.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Mogadishu swung in spite of the country's oppressive leadership, and one of its best-known acts was the <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30993-dur-dur-band/"" target=""_blank"">Dur-Dur Band</a>. Awesome Tapes From Africa has reissued some of their other albums before this, but this release of Dur-Dur's <i>Volume 5</i> is true to the label's name-- it's directly mastered from a cassette copy of the album, one of about 10 that the band recorded. As you might imagine, the preservation of master tapes has been low on the priorities list in Mogadishu for the last 20-odd years, so this is a case of making the best of what's available. For the most part, the sound is excellent. What hiss there is can easily be chalked up as part of the experience-- this music has never existed in a state of digital clarity.</p>
<p>Like many of the great African dance bands, Dur-Dur was a big, versatile group, with three horn players, four lead singers, three backing singers, two guitarists, a keyboardist, a drummer, two percussionists, and a bass player. The vocalists trade off from song to song, singing what the liner notes reveal to be mostly songs about relationship trouble (the novelty for Western listeners will be that a few deal with competition between wives in polygamist households), but unless you speak Somali, you'll be following the melody and not the story-- and the melodies are excellent.</p>
<p>The band's sound is funky throughout, with apparent influences from American funk and soul and possibly even West African music-- the static harmony of their heavy vamps is well matched to the modal, more traditional Somali vocal melodies. The group's one female singer, Sahra Abukar Dawo, also may have watched a handful of Bollywood films-- the edge on her held notes and the way she makes sudden leaps from legato to staccato phrasing is reminiscent of Asha Bhosle.</p>
<p>The songs on the tape were clearly not recorded at the same session, as the instrumentation and audio quality vary a fair amount. I wonder whether the musicians may have been updating their gear around the time they recorded this music-- some tracks feature meaty, old-school organ, while others feature tinny synth and what's either a drum machine or a very convincing approximation of one; the Caribbean-styled ""Dholey"" is replete with bendy synth lines and accent percussion that would sound at home on Phil Collins' <i>No Jacket Required</i>.</p>
<p>In the early 90s, unable to continue playing in their city, Dur-Dur Band broke up and scattered abroad. Their competition did too, and the cinemas, studios, hotels and theaters that once played host to their music closed, or were forced to. In 2006, Mogadishu was briefly dominated by Islamic extremists who attempted to outlaw music. The place where this music was made is still listed on the map as though nothing changed, but it's not the same city today as it was in 1987. This record is a superb glimpse of what was and what's been lost.</p></div>"|17612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17612-dur-dur-band-vol-5/|7.7|Joe Tangari

You also got stories about their bloody live shows and, later, online handwringing about them baiting controversy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a>-style by apparently flirting with fascist gestures at one of those shows. In the beginning, though, people were most interested in the part about four young dudes exploding out of ""nowhere"" (the Copenhagen DIY scene) fully formed and going on to release one of the best punk collections in recent memory. Their shows during that time were powerful in a very messy, very punk way. Two years later, they're a different band, one capable of more than shambling atmospherics and stage dives. Iceage write brilliant songs; on <i>You're Nothing</i>, they've found a way to clarify these compositional skills without stripping away their power.</p>
<p>Iceage's self-produced second album is even better than their debut. It's the quartet's first offering for the larger label Matador (the album's still being released by <a href=""http://escho.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Escho</a> in Denmark) and they come off even wilder and more chaotic than they did in 2011, but also more experienced and nuanced. They've honed the uncanny sense of classic punk songwriting-- the guitar sound's huge, the hooks more present, the charisma of dead-eyed, out-of-breath vocalist Elias Bender Rønnenfelt even greater. When you listen to the two records in tandem, you realize how brittle <i>New Brigade</i> was: ""brittle"" in an excellently fuzzed, rancid way, but <i>You're Nothing</i> is a heftier experience.</p>
<p>Unlike some groups who sign to a bigger label and beef up their sound in the wrong ways, Iceage used the new resources to hone what they already did well without abandoning what made them interesting in the first place. You can hear the shift on the industrial/ambient instrumental ""Interlude"", which helps to make <i>Nothing</i> darker and danker, and on ""Morals"", a mid-tempo piano-flecked track based on the 1960s Italian singer Mina's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTRGdDOAk0g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""L'Ultima Occasione""</a>. The odd reference fits here, building into a frenzy that finds Rønnenfelt hoarsely screaming ""Where's your morals?"" over militaristic rhythms. And, even with these slight tweaks, they don't fuck around: <i>New Brigade</i> offered 12 songs in 24 minutes, <i>You're Nothing</i> 12 songs in 28-and-a-half.</p>
<p>On the more typical Iceage songs, you get their mix of dirty punk and pulsing hardcore wrapped in an ink-black atmosphere, and Rønnenfelt's existential musings come in more powerful doses. The brilliant opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14827-ecstasy/"" target=""_blank"">""Ecstasy""</a>, which sounds like a punk anthem mid-melt, strings together furious tempo changes, with, Rønnenfelt howling ""I can't take this pressure"" in the final implosion. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14730-coalition/"" target=""_blank"">""Coalition""</a> is a classic rager, but you've never heard them doing doubled <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a> guitar hooks like this. From ""In Haze""'s clipped and twangy d-beat to the heavy bass of ""Everything Drifts"" to the spiraling anthemics of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12874-youre-nothing-bbc-session/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>, there are no weak spots. They chiseled things down for a reason: Great punk comes in spurts.</p>
<p>Rønnenfelt has said <i>You're Nothing</i> was inspired in part by his readings of Bataille, Genet, and the like. On these off-kilter anthems, you also imagine them reading Rimbaud, and get the sense that the group has taken Richard Hell and the Voidoids' ""Blank Generation"" to heart with lines like the title track's ""Thats right, you're nothing/ Feel the void grow"" and ""Ecstasy""'s ""But bliss is momentary anyhow/ Yet worth living for,"" along with the romantic surrealism of lines like ""If I could/ Leave my body then I would/ Bleed into a lake/ Dashing away/ Disappear"" from from ""Morals"". These are the sentiments of early 70s NYC punk made by kids who can look back on hardcore and post-punk to add fuel to it.</p>
<p>There was a moment at last year's Pitchfork Festival in Chicago that crystallized part of what makes Iceage fascinating: During their set, a bass head blew, then another, and then another. This is something that would usually cause a group to apologize, or blush, or throw a tantrum. But Iceage kept playing, didn't seem to sweat it, and calmly did their thing until someone else fixed the problem. Bassist Jakob Tvilling Pless looked around and shrugged it off. Rønnenfelt also kept going. In a way, it hardly registered. (Blank Generation, indeed.) It was my favorite moment of the weekend, and the most real: Iceage are a band who do these things honestly, and without thinking too much about it, and that's a big part of their power. That they back the attitude up with songs of this quality is what makes them unstoppable on <i>You're Nothing</i>.</p></div>"|17623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17623-iceage-youre-nothing/|8.6|Brandon Stosuy

The time that's passed since Beach Fossils' solid, well-received <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14281-beach-fossils/"" target=""_blank"">eponymous debut</a> has given its name an unintended resonance; when we all pass from this mortal coil, songs like ""Daydream"" and ""Vacation"" will be artifacts frozen in time, informing our descendents of what happened in 2010 when the attitudinal tenets of chillwave were leeching into fuzzy, soft-focus indie pop. There's the big picture stuff too: how to let one's ambition manifest, what really endures in a world where so much is fleeting, the challenges of squaring artistic expression with financial temptation. These are all relatable even if you're not in a band, and they've proven fine inspiration for musicians who confidently use their art as a means of making sense of it all. On the other hand, you sometimes get a passive-aggressive album like <i>Clash the Truth</i>,<i> </i>which just sounds kind of confused.</p>
<p>That's really the bigger concern. Their first album peers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28353-wild-nothing/"" target=""_blank"">Wild Nothing</a>, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28679-cloud-nothings/"" target=""_blank"">Cloud Nothings</a> have already proven themselves with assured, expansive sophomore LPs, and in even quicker succession, former guitarist Zachary Cole Smith's Dive went from ""Beach Fossils side project"" to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29923-dive/"" target=""_blank"">DIIV</a>, a band that surpassed them while operating in the same lane. There's a lack of conviction on <i>Clash the Truth</i> that finds numerous ways to infiltrate otherwise fine songs; the opening title-track makes an unexpected shift into a post-punk monotone which only stresses the utter lack of urgency in Payseur's vocals. By introducing a darker, more socially aware edge, it makes a song on the opposite end of the spectrum like ""Taking Off"" (""I'm taking off again/ It feels like it's so soon/ Am I excited or am I just so confused"") sound like a sheepish retreat to their previous work.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Beach Fossils' indecisiveness arises more subtly. Some wondered if the relative cleanliness of their 2011 <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15161-what-a-pleasure-ep/"" target=""_blank"">What a Pleasure</a> </i>EP detracted too much from the scrappy charm of <i>Beach Fossils</i>; it isn't the production methods that defined them so much as a kind of instrumental formalism where all the moving parts work in an almost militaristic lockstep. Without that rigidity, you get amiable, mid-fi college rock jangle along the lines of ""Careless"" and ""Crashed Out"", or drowsy, rainy-day window-watchers like ""Sleep Apnea"" that are perfectly tuneful in the moment and do little to impress on one's mind in any way, let alone establish themselves as the work of Beach Fossils and no one else. You also get the sense of a bigger, conceptual gambit that they couldn't quite grasp. The inclusion of several short guitar pieces isn't a bad move in theory; their riffs are often tasked with handling the expression when Payseur's flat, affectless voice cannot. But while their titles suggest some sort of attempt at unifying the disparate sounds of <i>Clash the Truth</i>, they manage no sequential effect<i> </i>and unlike DIIV, the difference between their instrumentals and vocal pieces is too wide to hear them as anything other than filler.</p>
<p>The wishy-washy attitude may be slightly bothersome for most of <i>Clash the Truth, </i>but it's frankly inexcusable on ""Generational Synthetic"", a song about the intersection of commerce and art whose title makes its point abundantly clear. Whether or not you think Beach Fossils have earned the right to make a song like this is a moot point. Two years ago, you wouldn't have thought Cloud Nothings would've had much to say about it either, but by making their sound a philosophy, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16158-attack-on-memory/"" target=""_blank""><i>Attack on Memory </i></a>was a kickass rock album and potent criticism. With its ringing guitars and brisk drum rolls, ""Generational Synthetic"" is not too different than any other Beach Fossils song. If they admitted to their own ambivalence, they'd come off as sympathetic. Instead, Beach Fossils come from a place of judgment and open themselves up to criticism.</p>
<p>As such, ""Generational Synthetic"" doesn't stand up to the slightest bit of scrutiny-- when Payseur leans on sarcastic, passive-aggressive commentary (""Oh your words are so poetic/ Generation apathetic""), he comes off as both preachy <i>and </i>phony in the context of music that sounds like part of the problem rather than the solution. And considering the troubling financial realities of even the most successful indie bands are common knowledge, by sneering ""trade your fortune for a song,"" he just sounds naïve.</p>
<p>Beach Fossils aren't hypocritical for making ""Generational Synthetic"", as criticizing a system you fully participate in is pretty much democracy in action. But a guy like Craig Schuftan, author of the alt-rock dissertation <i>Entertain Us!</i>, has thought longer and harder about the clash of indie rock and major money and calmly, <a href=""http://everguide.com.au/arts-and-culture/literary/interview/craig-schuftan.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unintentionally ethers their message with one sentence</a>: ""It's not so much about whether playing in front of a logo makes a mockery of your principles, it's more about making sure your principles are good in the first place, that they're strong enough to survive a process like that."" Or, as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29540-iceage/"" target=""_blank"">Iceage</a> put it, ""Where are your morals?"" On ""Generational Synthetic"", Beach Fossils get on a soapbox without taking a stand, and it's the most damning example of the mixed messages that pervade <i>Clash the Truth--</i><i> </i>as the cliché goes,<i> </i>be the change you want to see in the world.</p></div>"|17621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17621-beach-fossils-clash-the-truth/|5.8|Ian Cohen

In the wake of the lo-fi house movement, particularly the clutch of artists operating in New York on labels like L.I.E.S., this is now a familiar scenario. But Moon B is a little different. For one, he operates out of Atlanta, where he has relatively few peers. His first album comes not via a hip underground dance label but through Peoples Potential Unlimited, a D.C.-based imprint that specializes in reissuing old funk obscurities.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Now, Moon B is <i>not</i> a funk obscurity; or, at least, not an old one. This particular slab of eponymous vinyl <i>is</i> a reissue, however: he self-released an album last year, originally on cassette. It’s the first release on PPU’s Test Pressing series, which focuses on contemporary music. But Gray’s work fits surprisingly well with its motley crew on PPU, even if it’s not wholly retro. Its backward-looking qualities don’t indulge in nostalgia; instead of hypnagogic undercurrents, Moon B coasts on a distinct feeling of ease.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">At its most bubbly, like the opening track, <i>Moon B</i> has the same cruising-along feel of the brightest of Detroit techno-- say Model 500 or Rhythim Is Rhythim-- but without the futurist impulses. Gray is reportedly a seasoned crate digger: mixed in with the usual touchstones of Detroit techno and meaty Chicago house is dreamy incidental music and dusty library records, all packed together so neatly you can’t tell where one thread ends and the next begins. They have the improvised quality that comes from an artist who knows his equipment inside out: one who has listened to so many different kinds of records that he just <i>feels </i>where his melodies should snake and spiral out towards.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Gray’s range extends from <i>Dirty Mind</i>-style 1980s minimal funk to the gummy groove of “B Side TRK 2”, where the 4/4 beat feels like it’s held together with viscous jelly rather than house’s typical taut wireframes. Other tracks brim with the whimsy of imaginary after-school specials, and the rest are gasping slabs of brittle soul that shake and shimmy with the homegrown twist of a real set of hands at the controls. Throughout, </span><i>Moon B </i>stands out from the reams of music defined by lo-fi aesthetics; Gray seamlessly blends trends in electronic music without ever sounding trendy, proving that you don't have to have state of the art equipment <i>or </i>a heavy-handed concept to make distinctive and engaging dance music. </p></div>"|17757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17757-moon-b-moon-b/|7.5|Andrew Ryce

Frontman Paul Major (aka Top Dollar) have a few things they do very well, so fans will be happily unsurprised to hear that <i>Long Island</i>, their third proper release for <a href=""http://noquarter.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">No Quarter</a>, is very much an Endless Boogie record. Which is to say that it's another scummy, riff-stacked, delightfully boneheaded affair. </p>
<p>Endless Boogie tend to go where the spirit moves them-- they're known for unpredictable gigging, <a href=""http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/49040"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">marathon sets</a>, and hard to find 12""s-- and they've earned the right to be comfortably stubborn as Major approaches his 60th year. ""Ain't no guest list, no free drinks,"" he snarls on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3511-radio-birdman"" target=""_blank"">Radio Birdman</a>-like wailer ""General Admission"". ""No free rides, I hope to see you outside."" <i>Long Island</i> operates strictly on Endless Boogie's terms, though at 80 minutes, listener fatigue is a real danger. By the time you're through with the incredibly fun ""Taking Out the Trash"", the realization that you have a whole hour left to go sets in pretty hard.</p>
<p>But <i>Long Island</i> knows its audience. The repetitive, fairly simple templates give Major and guitarist Jesper Eklow room to play around, and they do in a fashion as elegant as it is sloppy. Even if you find yourself nodding in and out of these infinite, often fluid stretches of psychedelia, garage, and scorched, Southern-fried stoner rock, there are frequent enough bursts of extra gnarly guitar work, or some especially tasty groove, to snap you out of a haze.</p>
<p>There are also some real tunes here. Opener <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2013/02/06/171280349/get-dumb-the-knuckle-draggin-riffs-of-endless-boogie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Savagist""</a> is the sound of your favorite local go-nowhere bar band getting to the bottom of a bottle of absinthe, with Major growling all over it like Screamin' Jay Hawkins at his most pig-snort feverish. It's the best of three songs that go well over the 10-minute mark, and while it may seem blasphemous to suggest as much of a band like this, the shorter, tighter tracks suit them best. The squalling ""Imprecations"" plays like the soundtrack to <i>Easy Rider</i> if it starred your drunk, unemployed uncle, and the parched, gritty ""Occult Banker"" screams like a man in the deepest ethers of a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOQAyFSon-Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Guatemalan Insanity Pepper trip</a>.</p>
<p>The production is appropriately seedy, showcasing equipment that sounds like it's been on its last legs for a few decades, and when the band cooks, they <i>really</i> cook. <i>Long Island</i> probably isn't going to win any new fans for Endless Boogie, but their strengths are on display regardless.</p></div>"|17663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17663-endless-boogie-long-island/|6.6|Zach Kelly

If it was the 1980s, he probably would have fronted a band that sounded like the Replacements. If it was the 90s, he'd be penning decent approximations of Pavement songs. If it was the early 00s, he'd be part of the post-Strokes ""return of rock"" wave of Vines and Jet wannabes. But Hodges came up in the late 00s, so he founded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12419-starfucker/"" target=""_blank"">STRFKR</a> (or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29613-starfucker/"" target=""_blank"">Starfucker</a>, or Pyramid or Pyrmamiddd when they briefly lost their nerve) and emulated the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"" target=""_blank"">MGMT</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit/"" target=""_blank"">Passion Pit</a> model of synthy indie pop. No matter what, Hodges has what it takes to survive, if not exactly thrive.</p>
<p><i>Miracle Mile </i>is STRFKR's fourth record, which seems like a lot for a perennial second-tier band on the dorm-party circuit. This is a testament to Hodges' skill as a craftsman: He can turn out reasonably engaging amalgams of lightly funky disco rhythms and mildly trippy psych rock ambiance without breaking a sweat. His records-- now made in collaboration with a band that includes bassist Shawn Glassford, drummer Keil Corcoran, and guitarist Patrick Morris-- are always immaculate and thoroughly professional enterprises. But, like a machine designed to endlessly churn out identical pots, STRFKR apparently never wondered if the world needed another record like <i>Miracle Mile</i>. This band can capably turn out listenable, inoffensive music that conforms to the demands of the marketplace, but that doesn't mean <i>Miracle Mile</i> has any discernible personality or artistic character. It's just another well-made pot on a shelf with nothing inside.</p>
<p>It's a shame, because Hodges obviously wants STRFKR to stand out and mean something. There's that band name, of course. There's STRFKR's theatrical live show, which is like the kids' table alternative to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3139-of-montreal/"" target=""_blank"">of Montreal</a>. And there's Hodges' academic streak, which manifests itself in references to college syllabus-approved philosophers, like Alan Watts on 2011's <i>Reptilians </i>and Khalil Gibran on <i>Miracle Mile. </i>It would be stretch to call <i>Miracle Mile </i>a concept record, but there are thematic links between the songs. The album-opening ""While I'm Alive"" sets the tone: While the music is sugary and blandly hooky, Hodges grasps for the profound in the lyrics, singing about the underlying fear of death that's the opposite of YOLO hedonism: ""Just keep telling myself/ To live my life alive/ Like everything else/ Just keep on breathing and live."" If only Hodges didn't write about going through the motions like a man going through the motions.</p>
<p>Hodges repeatedly refers to restless nights, romantic tragedy, and emotional crisis on <i>Miracle Mile, </i>even as it remains set on a sleepy default pop rock setting. If anything is truly at stake here, Hodges is unable to convey it musically. Instead, STRFKR falls back on the band's dubious gifts for indie pastiche. ""Sazed"" shoplifts at least a couple of elements from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28094-washed-out/"" target=""_blank"">Washed Out</a>'s already plundered ""Feel it All Around"". ""Malmo"" references <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a>'s ""Holocene"" and utilizes the lamest of recent indie trends, the ""catchy"" whistle. ""Leave it All Behind"" and ""Last Words"" are typical of the same-y, mid-tempo laptop pop songs that dominate the interminable second half of <i>Miracle Mile.</i></p>
<p><i></i>At 15 tracks, it's at least twice as long as it should be. It's possible that the cumulative deadening effect of <i>Miracle Mile </i>is intentional, or that the contrast between the vacuous music and the spiritual ennui of the lyrics is supposed to be ironic. But <i>Miracle Mile </i>doesn't seem smart enough, musically or lyrically, for that to be the case.</p></div>"|17712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17712-starfucker-miracle-mile/|5.2|Steven Hyden

After 30 years together, the band has effectively come full circle, having completed its evolution from untamed beast to rock dignitary and, via the fearsome alter-ego offshoot Grinderman, back again. Factor in the recent resignation of Mick Harvey (Cave's right hand man since their Boys Next Door days in the late 1970s), and the sudden deep-sixing of Grinderman (as a recording entity, <a href=""http://www.coachella.com/#void"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">at least</a>), and the Bad Seeds' reliably black essence now more closely resembles a blank canvas. </p>
<p><i>Push the Sky Away</i> scans as the Bad Seeds' post-Grinderman comedown album, to be filed alongside statelier turns like 1997's <i>The Boatman's Call</i> and 2001's <i>No More Shall We Part</i>. But where the Bad Seeds' mellow records usually find Cave in pensive, piano-man mode, <i>Push the Sky Away</i> presents an uncharacteristically weightless, eerily atmospheric sound; in lieu of crossover ballads like ""Into My Arms"" and ""People Ain't No Good"", we have foggy reveries built upon ominously rumbling bass lines, twitchy rhythmic tics, and hushed-voice intimations. It may not erupt with same force as the Bad Seeds' stormiest gestures, but the underlying menace fuelling it remains.</p>
<p>The approach bears the influence of Grinderman as much as the Bad Seeds' decidedly more raucous 2008 release, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11375-dig-lazarus-dig/"" target=""_blank"">Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!</a>.</i> Though Grinderman was often seen as the Bad Seeds' wild child offspring, it was also a vehicle through which Cave and his increasingly prominent foil, Warren Ellis, could experiment with textures and loops (to the point of spawning a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16519-2-rmx/"" target=""_blank"">remix album</a>). These production intricacies form the bedrock of <i>Push the Sky Away</i>, which is less a showcase for Bad Seeds' powerhouse prowess than a reconstructed fever-dream memory of it, transmuting the familiar into something foreign. There's a sense of the Bad Seeds expanding their sound and unlearning it at the same time. (Drummer Jim Sclavunos wins the Take One for the Team Award here, tempering his usual thunderous thrust for stragetically timed snare-rim taps and brushed-skin driftiness.)</p>
<p>The freer, more exploratory bent extends to Cave's lyric sheet. True to the album's desolate, dead-of-night air, his songs are less narratively focussed, more stream-of-consciousness haze, countering <i>Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!</i>'s gritty urban milieu with impressionistic images of mermaids and the sea that reinforce the sense of a mind floating away. Tellingly, Cave has <a href=""http://www.nickcave.com/news/new-album-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds-push-the-sky-away-out-18-feb/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> his writing for the album was inspired by ""Googling curiosities,"" and his lyrical logic follows the same circuitous path as an extended, after-hours web-surfing session, bouncing between subjects profound and frivolous, indulging life-long obsessions and newfound, fleeting fascinations. Bad Seeds albums used to inspire you to reacquaint yourself with folk tales and the Old Testament; this one will have you brushing up on quantum physics, astronomy, and ""Hannah Montana"".</p>
<p>That last bit shouldn't come as a surprise: Over the past decade, Cave has shown a greater eagerness to interact with contemporary pop culture, from the Oprah shout-out on Grinderman's ""Kitchenette"" to the comically perverse Avril Lavigne fixation that formed a subplot in his 2009 novel, <i>The Death of Bunny Munro</i>. But where these namedrops have felt like humourous incongruities in Cave's fire-and-brimstone universe, <i>Push the Sky Away</i> straight-facedly acknowledges how modern phenomena like Wikipedia and Miley Cyrus hold as much sway over the populace as the Bible and Robert Johnson once did, while translating brooding ballads into text-speak and slang (""We No Who U R""). And where more recent Bad Seeds standouts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11700-abattoir-bluesthe-lyre-of-orpheus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Abattoir Blues</i></a>' ""There She Goes, My Beautiful World"" and <i>Lazarus</i>' ""We Call Upon the Author"" saw Cave writing songs about writing songs, <i>Push the Sky Away</i> goes one meta: The album's most elaborate track, ""Jubilee Street"", is answered by ""Finishing Jubilee Street"", a spartan, spoken-word account of a dream Cave had just after he completed work on the former.</p>
<p>For all the album's wandering spirit, the first eight tracks on <i>Push the Sky Away</i> are neatly structured into two complementary, four-song halves that mirror one another: each comes outfitted with an ominous opening salvo (""We No Who U R"", ""Mermaids""), an icy glare that thaws into an open-hearted address (""Wide Lovely Eyes"", ""We Real Cool""), and a scenery-chewing set piece (""Water's Edge"", ""Finishing Jubilee Street"") that hearkens back to early Bad Seeds storytelling turns like ""The Carny"". (Fittingly, original bassist Barry Adamson rejoined the band following the album's recording.) The simmering tension of each side is eventually unleashed through a slow-boiling, show-stopping epic. The aforementioned ""Jubilee Street"" is built upon a repeated <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQf4hzKpF1c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hey Joe""</a>-like chord progression that, thanks to Ellis' mesmerizing violin lines, grows more grandiose with each passing cycle, reaching such dizzying heights that you almost forget you're listening to a song about a murdered prostitute. But even that pales in comparison to side two's colossal ""Higgs Boson Blues"", which begins as a solitary 3 a.m. strum in the vein of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a>'s ""On the Beach"" but, over seven writhing minutes, ends up traversing the entirety of modern history, from ""the missionary with his small pox and flu"" to the birth of the Devil's music to the anticipated death of a certain teen-pop starlet who ""floats in a swimming pool.""</p>
<p>""Higgs Boson Blues"" is named for the elementary particle whose discovery last year was hailed as the most significant breakthrough in contemporary physics, one that essentially provides the missing piece in explaining the structure of our entire universe. But its discovery after 50 years of intense research has also led to something of <a href=""http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/12/28/higgs-boson-discovery-may-signal-the-worlds-last-physics-experiment/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an existential crisis among physicists</a>, who are now left with no theory to prove, and asking themselves, ""What now?"" One can imagine Nick Cave asking himself the same question as he entered his fourth decade fronting a deviant rock band that had seemingly mined every last shade of noir. But in this album's quietly defiant title-track denouement, he finds a renewed mission statement: ""If you got everything and you don't want no more/ You've got to just keep on pushing, keep on pushing/ Push the sky away."" Because when you can't see the sky, you can't see your limits.</p></div>"|17618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17618-push-the-sky-away/|8.0|Stuart Berman

Last year's Steve Albini-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16539-ugly/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ugly </i></a>was a ferocious post-punk, post-90s, post-<i>patience for your sorry ass </i>guitar-rock record. It sprawled like a double gatefold classic rock LP, but the tone was intensely, if not narrowly, aggressive. The group's sole Screaming Female, singer/guitarist Marissa<i> </i>Paternoster, tore through a series of loose songs spotlighting her unpredictable vocal and six-string contortions.<i> </i>Any bruises left in her wake were intentional.</p>
<p>The new <i>Chalk Tape </i>EP is half as long as <i>Ugly</i>, but twice as musically diverse. The record's short, economical songs expand on the psychedelic influences broached on <i>Ugly</i>, and take them into more sophisticated emotional terrain. <i>Chalk Tape </i>even subs in an acoustic guitar every now and then, and changes up the band's grunge/sludge template with Middle Eastern grooves and new wavey basslines. These subtle yet unmistakable musical flourishes accompany some of the hookiest, most melodic songs Screaming Females have ever recorded.</p>
<p>In a way, <i>Chalk Tape </i>feels like an act of reconnaissance, a cautious feeling-out to gauge whether fans will appreciate a relatively poppy follow-up to <i>Ugly. Chalk Tape </i>is composed of songs recorded throughout 2012 in a manner that deviated from the band's usual ""jam it out in the studio"" approach. These tracks started out as concepts written on a chalk board; the band then translated these ideas into songs, and laid them down quickly without further revisions. For the standout ""Bad Men"", the original concept could have been ""<i>Tusk</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23583-stevie-nicks/"" target=""_blank"">Stevie Nicks</a> ballad with a doom-folk twist""; that's what it ended up sounding like, anyway, thanks to Paternoster's surprisingly tender vocal and a demented, druggy coda that takes romantic desolation to a disquieting place. On the opposite end of <i>Chalk </i><i>Tape</i>'s spectrum is the brilliant ""Crushing the Kingdom"", a Dio-esque metal epic in 63 shred-filled seconds. In the middle is ""Sick Bed""; a rubbery bassline gives the song an extra dose of sinister psych rock evilness, but it's Paternoster who nails you to the floor, double-tracking her voice on the verse and turning it into a duet between ghostly, undead witches.</p>
<p><i>Chalk Tape </i>isn't completely removed from its predecessor; ""Green Vapors"" and the hellacious blast of white noise that is ""Wrecking Ball"" offer plenty of sudden, violent interruptions and skin-crawling rants. But now more than ever, Screaming Females can grab you with songs, rather than just an overpowering instrumental attack. ""Poison Arrow"" might be their best song yet-- Paternoster hangs back for the first part, letting the swinging rhythm section of Jarrett Dougherty and King Mike do most of the heavy lifting until slashing out some space for a choked, inverted guitar solo that stops just short of exploding. This is an exciting new direction for a very exciting rock band. <i>Chalk Tape </i>could wind up as an important transitional milestone on the way to a future breakthrough but for now, it's a very engaging record on its own.</p></div>"|17711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17711-screaming-females-chalk-tape/|7.9|Steven Hyden

It stuck to German experimental musicians thereafter, even though many of them embraced electronics as convenient solid-state synthesizers replaced unwieldy modular ones. It includes bands as organic and free as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1467-faust/"">Faust</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/82-amon-duul-ii/"">Amon Düül II</a>, bands as mechanical and stiff as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk </a>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>, and bands as wholly mystic as Popol Vuh. And yet for all its evident disjointedness, so-called Krautrock has a few broadly consistent traits. One is a shared drive to escape from blues-based rock, either by traveling back in time to pilfer from classical, jazz, and world music or forward to embrace the newfangled analog synthesizer. Another is a high quotient of improvisation and open forms. A third, quite simply, is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8800-hans-joachim-roedelius/"">Hans-Joachim Roedelius</a>.</p>
<p>Born in Berlin between the world wars, Roedelius is an elder statesman who epitomizes everything we associate with German experimental music over the last four decades. In 1967, he co-founded the influential experimental music venue Zodiak Free Arts Lab with early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a> member Conrad Schnitzler, where the pair met Dieter Moebius. They formed the trio Kluster, becoming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=cluster"">Cluster </a>after Schnitzler's brief tenure ended. Meanwhile, Moebius and Roedelius created another seminal band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28030-harmonia-eno-76/"">Harmonia</a>, with future Kraftwerk and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a> guitarist Michael Rother. Cluster played progressive rock, abstract experimental music, new age, and more, but made their most lasting impression as ambient keyboard caressers, infusing minimalist patterns and inert drones with playful jazz and spacey themes.</p>
<p>When Moebius left Cluster and the name was retired in 2010, Roedelius almost immediately formed <a href=""http://www.qluster.info/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Qluster </a>with <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Onnen+Bock"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Onnen Bock</a>, a relative youngblood at something like 40, and began to issue low-key yet gratifying albums at a furious pace. 2011 saw the release of a <a href=""http://www.bureau-b.com/qluster.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">trilogy</a>, some of it recorded live and all of it focused on improvised interplay for keyboard or piano. Though <i>Antworten </i>reputedly closed the trilogy, fourth record <i>Lauschen</i> picks up where it left off. Recorded live in Berlin with guest <a href=""http://arminmetz.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Armin Metz</a>, it's the sonic document of three men standing very still in front of intimidating electronic boxes. But these three are good enough to make that more exciting than it sounds. While the title (<i>Listen</i> in English) makes clear that this is head music, the body is not neglected. It becomes a sensitive head-to-toe antenna as different feelings radiate from the same harmonies depending on the palpable shapes and lengths of the waves.</p>
<p><i>Lauschen </i>frequently takes on a sinister edge but flows through plenty of tender and contemplative states as well. The musicians push at common objectives rather than one another, sliding into the grooves around each other's staked-out timbres and frequency ranges. The record is divided into nine movements, each named for a different classical muse, and while they roll continuously one into the next, they are also admirably self-contained. The ominous but controlled threnody of ""Kalliope"" runs right  into ""Urania"" before rumbling filter snaps begin a seamless transformation. The pitches are limited but their oscillation rates and periodic durations are constantly, calmly, and decisively nudged around. Held notes can be so intricately gated and filtered that their pitch and timbre contours verge on miniature compositions unto themselves. In the music's mostly slow movement, you can track individuals having and implementing ideas, each putting a meaningful twist in the whole.</p>
<p>Any jam involves throwing some spaghetti at the wall, but Qluster flick their pasta with sniper-precision. The highlights for me are the silkily pooling tonality of ""Euterpe"", the flutey Mesoamerican dream turned subterranean nightmare of ""Terpsichore"", and especially ""Melpomene"", which starts as a music-box ballet before majestic slopes of bass in the distance widen out the sense of scale. The invention only flags near the end, where ""Thalis"" reprises the a theme from ""Erato"" without putting much of a new spin on it. But if anyone has earned some placid victory laps after a lifetime of tireless exploration, it's Roedelius. None of these Qluster albums are apt to become cornerstones of your <i>kosmische </i>discography. But all of them, including <i>Lauschen</i>, offer the pleasure of hearing a deep musical mind still paddling the stars, at consummate ease now in his weathered craft.  </p></div>"|17719.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17719-qluster-lauschen/|6.5|Brian Howe

As Companion, however, she's almost unrecognizable as her former self: Armed with some glowing, magic-hour production, booming drums, and her trembling, emotive voice, she offers her personal vision of a big tent pop record, and it's a compellingly weird and personal one. ""I was listening to a lot of Hot 97,"" she has <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Companionmusic/info"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>, which explains absolutely nothing save for perhaps reaffirming the basic mysteriousness of music-making: She went on a strict diet of Hot 97, and somehow emerged with a project that resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"" target=""_blank"">Kate Bush</a> singing Gloria Estefan. Go figure.</p>
<p>Whatever her influences, they moved Ginsberg to some of the most charged, vivid songwriting of her career, starting with the ripe opener ""20th Century Crime"". Set to a watery, oscillating synth part that evokes a blue John Hughes skyline, she sings in a delicate puff of head voice on the verses before opening up into the glorious, stretched-out melisma of the chorus. She has a fluttery, decentered approach to singing-- somewhere between R&amp;B theatrics and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/"" target=""_blank"">Natasha Khan</a> doing vocal warm-ups-- that is intriguingly wayward, and it leads many of the songs on <i>Companion</i> through odd detours.</p>
<p>""No Kid/Blast"", for example, starts as a slow-burning lover's lament (""You, you, you/ You treat me like an arrow/ You shoot me into places/ I don't wanna go""), Ginsberg bending notes soulfully on the chorus. The guitar smears its tone into a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a>-ish blot, Ginsberg stacks her voice in layers of harmony, and then itchy drums and post-punkish guitars break out, starting a panicky dance party that settles back down just as it gets going. Every song comes with at least one cheap-seats hook, but the album's tone is unsettled, seemingly unsure of how arty or how straightforward it wants to be, and it makes <i>Companion</i> a genuinely unpredictable listen.</p>
<p>Some of these songs digress so often that they end up banging their heads away in corners; ""Homegirl"" interrupts itself repeatedly in its three minutes without making a point. <i>Companion</i> feels like a band hashing out its identity, and there are portions (the drifting instrumental coda to""Swimming/Wave"") where the listener feels like taking a bathroom break to leave them to it. The quirks that make Ginsberg's vision personal and unusual detract from the record's streamlined nature; pared down, it would almost certainly hit harder. As it is, <i>Companion</i> is a dramatic, ambitious record that falls a few inches short of its target. Ginsberg and co. aren't quite ""there"" yet; they sound like a band opening up for the band they ultimately want to become. But you can hear nervy exhilaration in <i>Companion</i>'s best moments: ""Welcome the new age,"" Ginsberg exults on ""New Age/Real Change"". Hopefully with a few more anthemic warm-up stretches, they'll get there.</p></div>"|17751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17751-companion-companion/|6.5|Jayson Greene

<p>Smith comes across similarly disenchanted and tempted by the prospect on <i>Songs for Imaginative People</i>, where he's torn between celebrating and bemoaning commercial excess: On opener ""(800) Human"", he laments how we waste our lives as collateral for empty material satisfaction in a lolling drawl that comes off like a bad James Murphy impersonation (which is doubly unfortunate since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a> lampooned vacuity with greater elegance). On the subsequent ""You Can't Be My Girl"", Smith tries to resist his attraction to a wastrel whose ""best friend is a red cup,"" wincingly encapsulated by his declaration, ""I love you are horrible."" (""I wouldn't expect most people to get that pause,"" he explained in an interview.)</p>
<p>""If the songs on my debut had a bite-sized element to them, the new songs are definitely full-size and king-size,"" Smith has said of <i>Songs</i>. <i>Darwin Deez</i> was played entirely on a four-string electric guitar, which gave the album a fairly banal, beatifically chiming feel throughout. He's expanded his palette here-- buying those two extra strings and a powerful fuzz pedal-- and tried to play against type by throwing destructive curveballs in the path of his pretty little ditties. As a result, <i>Songs</i> is distinctly uncatchy, a benefit for anyone driven mad by the wacky squawk of ""Radar Detector"" a few summers back. There's an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"" target=""_blank"">Autechre</a> sample on ""(800) Human)"", where he's taken inspiration from the Warp duo's difficult nature and parlayed it into a stalling, monotonous clank; the chorus to ""Moonlit"" is similarly unappealing, guitar bashed and blaring beneath his awkward yowl. Single ""Free (The Editorial Me)"" behaves itself structurally, but billows around a huge fuzzy blowout that sounds like Smith trying to sound like anyone but himself.</p>
<p>If the hooks fail to anchor in your brain, at least Smith's appalling way with an extended lyrical metaphor will: ""Alice"" has ""monopolized cute/ But talk about a trivial pursuit!"" On ""Redshift"", he's oblivious as to why it didn't work out, but inadvertently answers his own question: ""Spiral galaxies would turn in your eyes/ When I came by with a small surprise/ You loved all of my little <i>quarks</i>, so what went wrong?"" The impression left by <i>Songs for Imaginative People</i> is of a guy trying <i>way too hard</i> to be taken seriously. Smith hasn't yet got the creative or musical chops to make a capital-A album, and completely shunning his naturally artless expression isn't the way to get there.</p>
<p>""Have you ever seen a wrecking ball as small as her?/ She smashes up my glasses when she passes but it doesn't hurt/ I can't see straight now with this crush/ But I have all of this love to give, and there's no rush,"" Smith sings on ""Chelsea's Hotel"". It's <i>Songs</i>' sweetest line, a neat visual treatment for a commercial for spectacles or a dating website that works because of its naïve charm, not in spite of it. That's the undoing of <i>Songs for Imaginative People</i>, where Darwin Deez is all too keen to show how the sausages are made.</p></div>"|17722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17722-songs-for-imaginative-people/|5.0|Laura Snapes

If I got nothing else out of <i>Everybody on My Dick Like They Supposed to Be</i>, a rap mixtape from the lead singer of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2112-interpol/"">Interpol</a>, I will always have that moment. Scrolling to the comments out of sheer curiosity, I came across one user’s eloquent plea: ""stop gentrifying datpiff, white ppl."" I sat with that a minute. Then I downloaded Paul Banks' mixtape anyway.</p>
<p>As I listened, the weariness of this tiny protest stuck with me; from its rib-jab of a title on down, <i>Everybody on My Dick Like They Supposed to Be</i> feels intended to spark a quick instance of internet incredulity: a ripple of WTFs in your timeline, a few dumb jokes in comments sections (a favorite being ""Obstacle 1: Deez Nutz""). Whenever rock artists start fucking around with rap music, eyebrows raise, with good reason, and the prospect of Paul Banks <i>rapping</i>, with his dour, stentorian moan and deathlessly quotable lyrics, struck me as especially comical. Despite myself, I was nagged by faint curiosities: Would he dare to actually rap? If so, would his lyrics be as clumsy and clueless as this tape’s title? Would he drop mad science? And would any of this be remotely salvageable?</p>
<p>The answers to my low-stakes queries were all variations on ""no."" No, Banks doesn't sing or rap, and no, none of this is remotely salvageable. <i>Everybody on My Dick</i> mainly consists of Banks’ own beats and instrumentals, which are indistinguishable from most of the ones you hear on YouTube made by well-meaning college sophomores. They're littered with the canned synth pads and stock drum sounds of someone who hasn't spent much time or money on equipment, and the vocal samples strewn throughout lack imagination, to put it gently. ""Iron Mike"" samples the same old Tyson snippet (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWeD5KXx5WI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'm Alexander! He's no Alexander!""</a>) that's been used in more than one million rap songs to date (rough estimate). Clips from <i>Miller's Crossing</i> and <i>Robocop</i> float past, signifying zero. They aren't appealingly rudimentary, like Zaytoven or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30552-young-chop/"">Young Chop</a>; they're just rudimentary. Nowhere on this tape do you sense that Paul Banks actually has a feel for rap instrumentals, let alone a sense of how to make a good one.</p>
<p>And still, he managed to corral co-signs from two legit collaborators. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2348-talib-kweli/"">Talib Kweli</a> wanders in on ""What's in the Box"" (the title is, I'm guessing, a <i>Se7en</i> reference) and drops a hot line where no one is guaranteed to find it: ""Fuck the opinion of these celebrities, including me/ They ain't doing me like Jane Fonda in the 70s."" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"">El-P</a> also shows up on ""Quite Enough"" with a vivid, allusive, poorly recorded verse. To Banks’ credit, ""Trace"", with High Prizm, has a catchy, stabbing piano line, and there’s one pretty little synth sketch (""Show You My Footage"") that doesn't sound like a rap song at all and which could almost be something. But there is no effort, vision, or craft in this music. The title and artwork were more than enough; the mp3s don’t even need to exist.</p></div>"|17708.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17708-everybody-on-my-dick-like-they-supposed-to-be/|2.0|Jayson Greene

From house to grime to bass, he'd find a way to make anything knock on his own terms, no matter what kind of dancefloor you pointed him toward. What those terms were, though, seemed a bit up in the air-- with the unpredictability of his versatile approach came a sense that he was still synthesizing a great wide open host of influences. Things cohered a bit for Salva last year, though: after teaming with bass music cohort RL Grime to do a <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/salva/mercy-rl-grime-salva-rmx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">trapped-up remix</a> of Kanye's ""Mercy"" and coming away with internet-going-nuts buzz, he was vaulted to the top of the next-hype pile and tapped for tastemaking DJ sets.</p>
<p>If the timing of <i>Odd Furniture </i>feels a little perilous-- right at the crest of a growing anti-trap rave backlash-- the music itself should still endure whatever gets thrown at it before things settle back down. That's because the DNA of 808 hip-hop was in Salva's music for years, following him from Chicago to the Bay Area to L.A., it's just given a bit more volume and upfront homage here. While the five tracks on this EP highlight a more trimmed-down take on his long-gestating style, it does so with enough nods to a wider range of influences that there's some subtle but welcome variety. And it's hard not to imagine some of these tracks absolutely bulldozing over a crowd at the peak of a DJ set, small club, and huge festival alike.</p>
<p>Take opener ""Get a Life"", for instance-- a hyena-laughing bass anthem that hammers home a hook sourced from YG's ""I'm Good"" (""you at the club every weekend/ bitch, get a life"") and turns it into something of a self-effacing motto that highlights his DJ grind. Muscle past all the contemporary Southern bounce trappings and there's a keen integration of ghetto house, Miami bass, and trans-Atlantic techno that blurs the line between of-the-moment trends and their decades-old heritage. ""Drop That B"" feints at some of the more obvious trap rave tropes-- a down-pitched ""drop that bitch"" refrain and a hard clap rhythm that splits the difference between gunshot and snare drum-- it springs off its simple template to get successively twitchier and more sinuous with each ensuing buildup and breakdown until it sounds like a throwdown in the middle of a hydraulics factory. ""Hard Drive"" toys with the offspring of juke and g-funk (replete with ""Little Ghetto Boy"" spark-up SFX), ""Rest in 3-Piece"" refits icy tech house instrumentation into a fusion of dancehall and circa '92 jungle that straddles generations, and ""BBQ"" is a hopped-up take on baile funk that filters the favela sound through the streets of Chicago.</p>
<p>Of course, this music wouldn't hit as hard if Salva didn't put together some bracingly complex drum tracks. What separates him from the bandwagoners is his delirious sense of rhythm, streamlined from years of cross-pollinated listening and setlist creation into an almost improvisational rapport between snares, kicks, and bass. There's hardly an eight-bar stretch on this EP that doesn't elaborate on the foundational rhythm of a track, jostling the one and pouring in rolls and fills that rewind waists and scuff the soles of All-Stars and Jordans. The bass thumps, but the beats tumble and scatter, betraying a sneaky virtuosity and restlessness that toys with momentum like few of his peers.</p></div>"|17714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17714-odd-furniture-ep/|7.3|Nate Patrin

Intrigued, he brought his findings home, slapped one down on the turntable, and started strumming. The result of this past-and-present fusion is <i>Spectral Park</i>, the self-titled debut from Donovan's phonographically enhanced one-man band. But if the Spectral Park project got its start on a leisurely afternoon constitutional, the album itself winds up feeling a lot more like one of psychonaut hero Aldous Huxley's wild rides. The push-and-pull between Donovan's high-spirited, straight-outta-1966 psych-pop and the snatches of exotica he applies liberally to <i>Spectral Park</i>'s surfaces leaves the album constantly teetering on the edge of chaos. How fitting, then, that Donovan himself, driven almost mad by a romance gone sour, spends <i>Spectral Park</i> sounding every bit as turned-around and twisted as the funhouse mirrors that make up his music.</p>
<p>Well before the needle hits the wax, Donovan throws just about everything you can think of at his songs. His compositions would be plenty wriggly without the salvaged sounds-- waves of tropicalia, drum machine dribble, organs aplenty-- slathered over top. All this, Donovan presents at a pace several clicks above manic; could be Donovan's trying to throw sample snitchers off his trail by playing through his discard pile at an advance speed, but whatever the reason, <i>Spectral Park</i> doesn't leave much time to pause and reflect. Donovan's songs run the gamut from proto-punk to synth-pop, but between its frenetic gait, its thick carpet of harmonies, and its ebullient, every-which-way hooks, <i>Spectral Park</i> winds up feeling closest in spirit to that idyllic moment in the mid-60s when psychedelics had permeated the culture but the hippies could still handle their speed. On the surface, <i>Spectral Park</i> is all smiles: every hook's a gusher, every little noise that floats by another chance at a blown mind. But there's an unease running under <i>Spectral Park</i>'s madcap multivalence, a bitter pill only made swallowable by Donovan's candied choruses.</p>
<p>Donovan's the romantic type, but here, he sounds like he's at the end of his rope. <i>Spectral Park</i> begins with a series of pleas-- ""Are you tired? Tired of me? Like I'm tired of you? Like I'm tired of this?""-- and goes from there, with Donovan switching off between a kind of doomed idealism and a resignation that whatever this is, it just isn't working. ""We've done this all wrong, we talked for too long, betrothed ourselves to eager bad advice,"" Donovan admits on <i>Spectral Park</i> highlight ""Nausea"", holding back the bile as best he can. His desperate words and this frantic music make for a kind of technicolored romantic frenzy not unlike of Montreal's <i>Fantasia</i> of self-consciousness circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9796-hissing-fauna-are-you-the-destroyer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hissing Fauna</i></a>. Donovan's lovelorn streak provides a much-needed dose of reality amidst <i>Spectral Park</i>'s gumdrop wonderland, an orientation point in the center of the psychedelic swirl.</p>
<p>When you can make it out, that is. <i>Spectral Park</i>'s a wild ride, but all the stuff zipping past your head makes for a lot of motion blur. You might not even notice Donovan's sadsack streak your first few times through <i>Spectral Park</i>, as you'll be too distracted by all the pretty colors, the endlessly transmogrifying hooks, the way every song seems to stumble headlong into the next. Between the spring-loaded choruses, the far-flung samples, and Donovan's chest-clutching lyrics, <i>Spectral Park</i>'s got a lot going for it; at times, maybe a little too much. Donovan occasionally seems to be competing with himself for space in the mix, occasionally drowning out his own voice in a sea of crackling samples and peripheral swirl. Halfway through the organ-soaked ""Cut"", he silences half of his pocket symphony, letting the hook-- not coincidentally, the album's best-- shine through. It's one of just a few moments on <i>Spectral Park</i> where he doesn't seem compelled to dredge up every musical notion he's ever had all at once. But for Donovan, mired in romantic disorder throughout the topsy-turvy <i>Spectral Park</i>, clarity seems a far-off goal.

He has a keen ear for melody, a terse, supple way with rhythm programming, and a sensitive dowsing rod for strange gems and ores hidden under timbral crust. His humid webs of synthetic tones and bass, drums, and treated voices are full of graceful curves and slants. Each intonation of a motif is unique as a piece of hand-blown glass. Best of all is his knack for startling, bafflingly perfect changes in tack, which is in fine form on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/22-dreaming-in-key/"">Dreaming in Key</a>, </i>his new record as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28238-applescal/"">Applescal</a>. His music's slippery momentum and Frankensteinian melodies seem designed to delight rather than unsettle. Among fellow deconstructive electronic musicians, he makes for a uniquely genial as well as interesting companion.</p>
<p>Loops are naturally, stubbornly additive, but Applescal's are so pliant that the music feels conscious, especially at points of transition-- prone to pausing and gathering itself before swirling into a new form. At the top of a long, warming rise, you're as likely to find a frosty plateau or a side-winding shift as a sheer drop. He's not interested in forward motion; instead, he develops overlapping concentric circles of melody and rhythm, like rain dappling water. With shades of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a> in its spacey melody and Morse code percussion, ""Onetasker"" teases at catharsis before finally unleashing one huge, woozily droning chord. The percolating beginning of ""Vintage Clown / Shadow Hunters"" abruptly slumps into a post-R&amp;B vocal fantasy, which is gradually split open by geysers of molten synths. The stellar ""On the Way"" starts at an oozy lope but ends in a glorious pile of marbled, backmasked melody, making the old technique feel fresh.</p>
<p>Applescal is profligate but consistent with genre: He likes to combine springy tech house arpeggios, intrepid harmonic explorations, and tilted minimalist percussion with hefty ambient stuffing and a sparkly veneer of 90s IDM. It's mind/body music in the lineage of James Holden's <a href=""http://www.bordercommunity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Border Community</a> label output, seeping fluidly between kinetic ecstasy and moody solitude. Applescal's versatility and vision caused his prior records to meander sometimes, bogged down by surplus ability and eagerness. That's what makes this more sharply focused third LP a great entry point-- though it wouldn't be Applescal without a certain amount of meandering. He vamps well, working filters and oscillators the way a jazz keyboardist works a modal scale. But his music is most compelling at its most structured, when he carefully draws different elements into uncanny wholes. The best example is still 2010's ""Dialeague"", where the warmest, most thickly rolling drones and the coldest, thinnest swirl of notes breathe in unison, though it's now rivaled by ""On the Way"".</p>
<p>As an opener, ""Boys"" is intriguing but limited in scope, with exhalations and hisses atomized over exfoliating arpeggios and locomotive drums. The live version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12802-el-diablo-ep/"" target=""_blank"">""El Diablo""</a> is a little too like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3638-ratatat/"" target=""_blank"">Ratatat</a> for comfort, and closer ""Keep on Dreaming"" feels like an afterthought. But everything else on <i>Dreaming in Key</i> is rich, vivid, and full of surprises. The dreamy ""Lonely People"" draws songful metallic pulses into an almost fugue-like structure, while the visceral ""Spring and Life"" has a bassy carved-out menace recalling Booka Shade's ""Darko"". Standout ""Wise Noise on Time"" channels <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5293-pantha-du-prince/"">Pantha du Prince</a> with its tinkling, starry variations, but not before a ghostly melodic line suddenly leaps up to a squeal and hangs there, forming a yawning chasm around a steely bass. Among heavy competition, it's one of my favorite ""Applescal moments"" so far, the kind where a solid form seems to be pulled out of thin air.</p></div>"|17718.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17718-dreaming-in-key/|7.6|Brian Howe

Its identity in a post-Soundcloud world hinges on extending the UK bass diaspora far outside the confines of Bok Bok and L-Vis 1990's London-- all the way to Los Angeles (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28578-kingdom/"" target=""_blank"">Kingdom</a>), Toronto (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29413-egyptrixx/"" target=""_blank"">Egyptrixx</a>), even Savannah, Georgia (Helix), and Lawrence, Kansas (MORRI$). And the Night Slugs sound, such as it is, isn't merely compatible with but hotly anticipates so many potential directions for underground and aboveground club music, all while revealing a deep and adventurous postmodern enthusiasm for its decades of heritage. Run though their three-year catalogue and you'll hear adventurous integrations of boogie funk and electro, deep house, Second Summer of Love rave, first-gen two-step, pirate-radio grime, and white-label dubstep. The label's sonic commonalities mostly extend to a garage-inflected sensibility, a thing for feverishly intricate yet danceable drum tracks, and an intangible mood of refined hyperactivity-- enough to make for a trustworthy imprint, while still keeping its style fairly unconstricted.</p>
<p>Like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14927-night-slugs-allstars-volume-1/"" target=""_blank"">first volume of the <i>Night Slugs Allstars </i> series</a>, <i>Night Slugs Allstars Volume 2 </i> ties together highlights from the roster's most visible and pivotal members. Its label-sampler format draws off a lot of previously released material, though there are just as many potentially overlooked deep cuts as there are top-tier favorites. It's practically a given that this is a collection for people who've already checked out <i>Volume 1</i>, whether it was their introduction to the label or a culmination of everything they'd already grown to appreciate about it. But it also reveals subtler pleasures at work under the label's purview. There's nothing on here with the instant gravitational pull of <i>Volume 1</i>'s appearance by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29250-girl-unit/"" target=""_blank"">Girl Unit</a>'s go-berserk ""Wut"", the breakthrough single that cranked up the label's early buzz 2 1/2 years ago. But <i>Volume 2 </i> does a lot to show just how much ground one label can really cover.</p>
<p>The handful of new and/or unheard tracks are enough to bolster the ranks and give the diehards something to look forward to, but they're not the kinds of afterthoughts that come across as fans-only barrel-scrapings. L-Vis 1990 delivers ""Not Mad"", a twitchy stomp of a cut that pits an off-kilter shuffle-beat bassline against nervous chuckles, xylophone rolls, and 85 pop-funk synthesizers. Girl Unit's ""Double Take Part II"" reconfigures the last minute or so of the <i>Club Rez </i>original so that the shivery slow-jam R&amp;B coda stands alone as its own song-- becoming his most accessibly moving track to date. The East Coast contingent turns in a couple gems, too. The all-tension/no-release drift of Kingdom's ""Bank Head"" is the most provocative track on the compilation, constructing a whole track off the kind of anticipatory clap-drummed, sweeping chord build that usually prefigures some kind of big sonic epiphany that never actually arrives. (It should work wonders as a DJ set opener.) Egyptrixx's ""Adult"" is a bit more intense-- there's something to it that feels like the austere future-noir drum and bass of late 90s Photek wrapped around a post-dubstep chassis-- but its ebb and flow pumps laser-cut chords and all-caps bass over an efficiently propulsive rhythm track that lets a lot of air in between the beats.</p>
<p>The rest of the collection is filled out by singles, b-sides, remixes, and deep EP tracks that point towards a more crossover-friendly direction for the label-- one that's trimmed away some of the over-the-top bombast while still prioritizing a sense of rhythmic intricacy. It's a smartly selected cross section that covers a lot of bases: Kingdom's tense horror-flick homage ""Stalker Ha"", the glowing, prismatic techno of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30014-jam-city/"" target=""_blank"">Jam City</a>'s ""How We Relate to the Body"", the luxuriant longing of L-Vis 1990's Javeon McCarthy deep house feature ""Lost in Love (Night Slugs Street Mix)"", and Helix's frenetic, understatedly titled kick/snare apocalypse ""Drum Track"". Novel without being gimmicky, body-moving without being overbearing, these are all selections that point towards a rewarding future for one of the most exciting labels in bass music. <span style=""color: #222222;"">Whether or not they're pointing the way for some scene or another, the artists of Night Slugs definitely know where they want to go themselves.</span></p></div>"|17572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17572-night-slugs-allstars-volume-2/|8.0|Nate Patrin

""You wish you were pretty, but you're not/ Ha-ha-ha,"" she sang at the beginning of an excellent record with the cruelly ironic title <i>Happiness</i>. Like her plaintive-voiced contemporary <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"" target=""_blank"">Liz Phair</a>, Germano's music is at once a critique and a celebration of femininity. (<i>Happiness</i> first came out a month after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11921-exile-in-guyville-15th-anniversary/"" target=""_blank""><i>Exile in Guyville</i></a>, and she had a minor alt-rock hit with an uncharacteristically sunny song called ""The Dresses Song"".) But Germano also tread into much darker corners of the psyche than Phair and most of her contemporaries, tackling themes of depression, abuse, body image and occasionally, just enough to keep things from getting unrealistically bleak, being happily in love. No matter the topic or mood, Germano's lyrics feel like secret, intercepted thoughts, frighteningly articulate accounts of the things people rarely admit to thinking about themselves. She often sounds like the devil on her own shoulder, singing to herself as she stitches the angel's mouth shut.</p>
<p><i>No Elephants</i> is her ninth record, and the fourth she's made since declaring, in 1998, that she was quitting the music business forever. The music she's made since she (thankfully) reneged on that promise has been a bit more subdued sonically, centered around her piano and violin rather than the evocative, adventurous guitar tones that characterized her 90s work, but her songwriting has been as cutting and uncompromising as ever. 2003's <i>Lullaby for Liquid Pig</i> and 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9486-in-the-maybe-world/"" target=""_blank""><i>In the Maybe World</i></a> were cosmically dark enough to find a fan in Michael Gira, who released them on his own Young God label.</p>
<p>On a cursory listen, the somewhat restricted sonic palette she pulls from on <i>No Elephants</i> might scan as ""pretty"": composed mostly of delicately plinking piano and Germano's snowy puff of a falsetto, which shape these fragile melodies with a featherlight touch. But lean in a little closer and it's classic Germano-- her lyrics perhaps even more jarring, rough-hewn, and anguished than ever. The opener ""Ruminants"" begins sounding like something you'd hear coming out of an ice cream truck circling a Lynchian cul de sac, and only grows eerier as Germano conjures surreal imagery: vomit, viscera, and bulldozers. ""Throw up, start over,"" she sings. ""I need four stomachs to deal."" This one's probably right up Gira's alley too.</p>
<p><i>No Elephants</i> is a meditation on two themes that seem very different but become entwined as the record goes on. The first is animal cruelty (""There is a natural order to this world that the human race has completely messed up. Especially in how we treat animals,"" she says in explanation of some of the record's lyrics. ""It's almost forgotten that there is an exchange between us.""), and the other is the difficulty of ""real,"" direct communication in a technology-crazed world. Germano tries to unite these two ideas through samples and found sounds, which she's used inventively throughout her career. (Perhaps the most piercing song she's ever recorded, ""A Psychopath"", features the frantic audio of a woman calling 911 after an intruder has entered her home.)</p>
<p>The sparse piano ballads on <i>No Elephants</i> are scattered with artful interruptions from farm animals, dial tones, and random electronic buzzes. Her unconventional use of samples on the otherwise mostly acoustic album calls to mind the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/116-fiona-apple/"" target=""_blank"">Fiona Apple</a> scattered them throughout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16732-the-idler-wheel-is-wiser-than-the-driver-of-the-screw-and-whipping-cords-will-serve-you-more-than-ropes-will-ever-do/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Idler Wheel</i></a>, aiming for a natural vibe as though somebody left the window open while the song was being recorded. Save for the instrumental ""Dance of the Bees"" (a sound collage of cell phone interference that sounds a lot like a buzzing hive), it doesn't quite come together. The samples and some of the lyrics feel a little too controlled, on-message, and conceptual, which is unusual since her songs often tease out the dark emotion in mundane, everyday moments. As a result, <i>No Elephants</i> often feels hermetic and occasionally impenetrably austere.</p>
<p>That's not to say the record is without moments of striking beauty: the piano ballad ""And So On"" is one of the most simply affecting songs she's written (""And when you break a heart, it's always after you/ Haunted""), moving with the wistful grace of a more forlorn, modern day take on ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"". The closing track ""Strange Bird"" is also a standout, centered around a poetic yet economical lyric that captures simultaneous feelings of alienation and interconnectedness (""All alone as we are, birds flying all around""). But overall, <i>No Elephants</i> feels inert in a way that Germano's records usually aren't. She has a gift for distinguishing between melancholy's infinite shades of grey, but the most of the songs here feel uncharacteristically monochromatic.</p>
<p>Germano ""retired"" in 1998 because even during alternative rock's anything-goes mainstream moment, her unflinchingly personal records had trouble connecting to mass audiences and finding a home at major labels. (She was on Capitol briefly, and released some of her best albums on 4AD when they were distributed in the U.S. by Warner Brothers.) Though she has a small, devoted fanbase, it's tempting to imagine what her career might have looked like if she hadn't had to do battle with the majors-- especially right now, in a moment when 90s artists like Apple are taking advantage of their crumbling dominance, connecting more directly with fans, and rerouting their careers on their own uncompromising terms. Which is why it's a shame that<i> No Elephants</i> is an uncharacteristic weak spot in her discography; if ever there were a time Germano could have slipped through the cracks and had a sleeper underground hit, now is as likely a time as any. On the bright side, though, it's now easier than ever for new converts to discover her best records. Technology might sometimes feel as pesky as a buzzing bee, but if it allows for even a few people to stumble upon Lisa Germano's deep back catalog, it can't be all that bad.</p></div>"|17583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17583-no-elephants/|6.3|Lindsay Zoladz

Fortunately, when the scene became the controversial subject of media attention last year, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30546-sasha-gohard/"" target=""_blank"">Sasha Go Hard</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30545-katie-got-bandz/"" target=""_blank"">Katie Got Bandz</a> received just as much of it as Lil Reese, Fredo Santana, and the rest of the rappers drafting off of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"" target=""_blank"">Chief Keef</a>'s obsessibility.</p>
<p>At the time, the main difference between Sasha and Katie and their male equivalents was that instead of rapping about being a ""hitta""-- the local term for an ass-kicker-- they rapped about being in love with hittas. Otherwise, they rode the same kind of icily sociopathic beats from the same producers as any other drill rappers, and came across equally as tough.</p>
<p>But while Chief Keef and his Glory Boyz crew are attempting to ride the drill craze towards a mainstream audience, Sasha and Katie have both recently made some interesting left turns. Back in November, Katie appeared on ""Kat!e"", a single by Fool's Gold artist Carnage that combined the signature drill sound with squawking moombahton synthesizers and seemed aimed more towards edgy EDM kids than listeners of mixtape rap. Now Sasha's released her third solo full-length, <i>Round Three</i>, which finds her heading in a far less grim, more pleasurable direction.</p>
<p>That <i>Round Three</i> is a different animal from Sasha's past mixtapes is apparent even before you download it, thanks to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"" target=""_blank"">Diplo</a> production credit sitting proudly beside the opening track. ""Damn"" opens with a few seconds of pleasantly blippy synthesizer arpeggios before turning itself inside out and morphing into a straight-up EDM track with a propulsive, handclap-heavy beat and the kind of enjoyably annoying synth sounds that have become Diplo's trademark. ""Pretty Fly"", produced by Absolut-P, follows suit with an electro streak that's far more suggestive of rooms full of sweaty, neon-clad young people than the blighted streets of the South Side.</p>
<p>But Sasha hasn't gone full-on hip-house revivalist, as interesting as that might be to imagine. Most of <i>Round Three</i> offers the same kind of pleasures as her past mixtapes, just with a broader range of sounds. The Absolute-P beat behind ""Bringing Heat"" uses burbling synthesizers and cinematic strings to evoke the kind of ominous mood that Chicago rap has come to be known for, albeit in a warmer, more organic way that lacks the jittery edge of, say, a Young Chop production. Block on Da Trakk's ""Kill Bill"" beat is straight Chicago drill, with the requisite gunshots, tolling bells, and hi-hat spasms, but certain flourishes-- like the backwards kick drum that sounds like a heartbeat-- add a subtle flavor to the usual bombastic overload.</p>
<p>Sasha's flow is still miles away from that kind of subtlety, though. Like the rest of her class of young Chicago MCs, her writing is light on metaphor and heavy on unadorned real talk. What she does have is a surfeit of charisma; enough to sell a line like ""I think that I am Kill Bill"" that doesn't make any kind of apparent sense on paper, and enough to outshine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29697-kreayshawn/"" target=""_blank"">Kreayshawn</a>, whose verse on ""Kill Bill"" seems like she actually put some effort into it.</p>
<p>She's also got a smartly adventurous side that's developing in an interesting way. Writing a female-centric anti-hater anthem like ""To the Girls"" isn't a wildly outside-the-box idea, but inviting the avant-garde rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30311-le1f/"" target=""_blank"">Le1f</a>-- who happens to be a gay man-- to contribute a shade-throwing verse is conceptually crafty, not to mention immensely satisfying to hear. Sasha's drill-scene connections have brought her a long way, but the company she's keeping now is a lot more interesting.</p></div>"|17747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17747-round-3-the-knockout/|6.6|Miles Raymer

As short patterns of chords or intervals revolve hypnotically, overlapping layers of echo and decay well up around them until only the tips of the keyed notes glint out. The music lands somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13319-erik-satie/"" target=""_blank"">Erik Satie</a>, though Sweat's singing has a decidedly folksy cast. This balance of cool circumspection and human warmth is just one of the deep contrasts churning her music's simple surface. It's impossible to decide whether the music is constantly changing or totally still, a strangely placid kind of tension that never fails to draw me in.</p>
<p>I fell hard for Lady Lazarus' first full-length album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14952-mantic/""><i>Mantic</i></a>, which I still love. But in hindsight, I let myself overlook the meandering stretches, which are scarcer on new LP <a href=""http://ladylazarus.bandcamp.com/album/all-my-love-in-half-light"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>All My Love in Half Light</i></a>, recorded in San Francisco with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5127-papercuts/"">Papercuts</a>' Jason Quever. It will sound instantly familiar to fans of <i>Mantic-- </i>at least once you get past the brassy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14516-lapsarian/"">""Lapsarian""</a>-- but its proportions are sturdier and its vocal melodies more sharply honed. Instead of slipping off into the distance, Sweat strongly projects from the center of the frame, though her romantic lyrics are still strewn about in coded fragments. There are new production touches that enhance the sound without diluting its essential simplicity: Faint harmonies ring the vocal of ""Eventide"" and a cello discreetly flickers through ""Constant Apples"". The means are still strictly limited, but more versatile than they sound.</p>
<p>There are essentially four different types of Lady Lazarus songs here, all of which have analogues on <i>Mantic.</i> Sweat helpfully fills the four opening slots with an example of each, setting the parameters for the rest of the record. There's the type that ditches piano in favor of accordion, tucked away near the end of<i> </i><i>Mantic</i> as ""Pearl"" but audaciously beginning <i>All My Love</i> as ""Lapsarian"", where Sweat belts like a <a href=""http://fasola.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sacred Harp</a> singer over the noisy instrument. There's the type built around a tone-packed pulse, such as the gorgeously tolling ""Goudanov"", and the type built around a silence-packed theme, such as ""Wonder, Inc"". And of course, there's the type built on pearly scalar columns: ""Eventide"" is this record's answer to <i>Mantic</i> standout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11765-the-eye-in-the-eye-of-the-storm/"">""The Eye in the Eye of the Storm""</a>, speeding up when she sings and dragging when she stops, as if the piano were feeding directly off her voice.</p>
<p>While the beauty doesn't flag in the second half, the forms do start to repeat, with ""Edge"" recapturing the wistful blur of ""Wonder, Inc""; ""Constant Apples"" the regressing mirrors of ""Goudanov"". Even so, Sweat manages to glimpse some striking new vistas from within her familiar straits. With its bobbing major chords and images of ships on the Atlantic, ""Argosy"" is as sun-bathed and spacious as her usual songs are misty and occluded. A blizzard of trills descends on the low, craggy ""Gleam"", closing the album with an unusually bracing chill. Lady Lazarus' music is so drowsy and rapt, so vast and alone, that I always wondered if clearer recording and bolder singing might ruin it. It's a relief to discover on <i>All My Love in Half Light</i> that that's definitely not the case.</p></div>"|17580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17580-all-my-love-in-half-light/|7.8|Brian Howe

However, last year's hyperkinetic <i>Shy Pursuit</i> was a more balanced affair; you didn't have to follow the literal meaning of the blithely careening ""Keep Them Alive"" or crunching new-wave anthem ""Take It"" to enjoy the chase. With its color wheel-spinning palette, sticky, curlicued melodies, and poignant lyrical reflections, <i>Cool Cocoon</i> is an occasionally breathtaking highwire walk between craft and genuine feeling that builds confidently on its predecessor.</p>
<p>For a start, they've left the tunes more room to breathe: See the strummy, piano-based ""What I Love"", where intricate strings and percussion leave enough room for a sense of floating-on-air giddiness that usually goes hand-in-hand with new romance. The clappy ""She Don't Want Me"" conjures a more lucid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>, and comes closest to <i>The Shy Pursuit</i>'s breakneck ebullience. But even the more cryptic moments, such as love-your-enemies swooner ""Enemy"", have singalong choruses and impeccable arrangements to rival fellow indie-leaning power-poppers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26449-the-new-pornographers/"" target=""_blank"">the New Pornographers</a>.</p>
<p>Almost 17 years after they originally formed, the Spinto Band seem to be examining their relationship with music, as well as other people, on <i>Cool Cocoon</i>. ""Amy + Jen"" is a thoughtful if pointed response to a newfound duo prepping their first cassette; the Badfinger-saluting opener ""Shake it Off"", where the narrator is ""unhappy with dreaming,"" could as easily be about giving up on a band as a lover. Thankfully, <i>Cool Cocoon</i> stops short of getting lost in its own head: Another standout, the practically-power ballad ""Memo"", directly criticizes how we ""over-intellectualize,"" with the chorus' subtle shift from ""you don't feel any better"" to ""you don't feel"" hammering the point home.</p>
<p>The Spinto Band can sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"" target=""_blank"">Paul McCartney</a> disciple Emitt Rhodes one second, pop-polymath newcomers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30523-foxygen/"" target=""_blank"">Foxygen</a> the next. Their perpetual underdog, self-releasing ways bring to mind lo-fi godhead <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2930-r-stevie-moore/"" target=""_blank"">R. Stevie Moore</a>, fictional pop self-mythologizer Nik Worth from Dana Spiotta's great 2011 novel <i>Stone Arabia</i>, or any number of overlooked indie rock lifers in mid-size cities nationwide. They've firmly established their canon over the past two decades, and they're edging ever closer to deserving a place within it-- even if they don't necessarily believe it themselves. On the clanging, penultimate track ""Na Na Na"", a vocal melody rises like a balloon filling with a helium, and heralds the line, ""Believe me, no one in history will ever sit there thinking/ Whatever did become of us?"" You never know, though. The title might imply a sense of transformation, but <i>Cool Cocoon</i> reveals a band convincingly growing into what it had longed to be all along.</p></div>"|17733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17733-cool-cocoon/|7.6|Marc Hogan

In fact, it sounds claustrophobic-- hookless, even. During what <i>feels </i>like the chorus, Yannis Philippakis can't quite get hold of a melody that sounds like it might never resolve. All the while, he's being cramped by increasing amounts of reverb. But then, at about the 1:45 mark, he yells, ""and I can't get enough... <i>SPACE!</i>"" and then <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5720-foals/"">Foals</a> break the song wide open with a riff that's startlingly low-slung and grunge-y for technically proficient guys who otherwise proudly wield their guitars pecs-high. You can easily hear a throng of festival-goers absolutely losing its shit during this extremely self-reflexive moment, and there's more like it on <i>Holy Fire</i>, which is a good thing. On 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14269-total-life-forever/"">Total Life Forever</a>, </i>a band once known for spindly, inscrutable songs like ""Mathletics"" made a shift to expansive and emotive rock in a way that was both surprising and completely logical. With <i>Holy Fire</i>, there's an added element of showmanship that establishes it as a point of no return.</p>
<p>""Inhaler"" makes even more sense in the context of <i>Holy Fire</i>'s sequencing, as it's preceded by ""Prelude"" (natch), a four-minute instrumental of build-and-burst dynamics that splits the difference between the Alan Parsons Project's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCR85u9QngQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sirius""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2112-interpol/"" target=""_blank"">Interpol</a>'s ""Untitled"" in terms of fostering arena preparedness. There are key moments when everything drops out except for Philippakis' and Jimmy Smith's pinging guitars, and you imagine the floodlights cast on the audience right before the beat drops again. It's hard to hear ""Prelude"" as being meant for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Not everything about <i>Holy Fire </i>is this obvious, though there is a crowd-pleasing streak where Foals embrace how they can make their most populist, personal, and direct music all at the same time. While leagues more melodic and softly produced than anything on their debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11372-antidotes/"">Antidotes</a>, Total Life Forever </i>singles such as ""Blue Blood"" and ""Miami"" still dealt in post-punk terminology, high-fretboard riffs, fractured drumming, verses and choruses fitting at odd angles. ""Everytime"" and ""Bad Habit"" (whose verse melody is perilously close to that of <i>TLF</i>'s ""This Orient"") are considerably more tapered and pop-savvy, making the hooks feel like bigger payoffs by gracefully ascending towards them. A similar refinement happens on the maddeningly catchy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14680-my-number/"">""My Number""</a>, which reshapes the cyclical chants of ""Total Life Forever"" into a song that's 85% hook; deceptively chipper funk-rock surrounding a bitter declaration of romantic independence where the latter sought eternal companionship. At least in contemporary terms, it's easy to hear them as the muscular, brooding complement to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7372-wild-beasts/"" target=""_blank"">Wild Beasts</a>' limber, libidinous take on wounded British masculinity, although their more overt commercial appeal puts them in the lineage of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">Cure</a> in stadium mode, circa <i>Wish.</i></p>
<p>That's also cause for relief; based on the success of ""Spanish Sahara"", you'd be forgiven for thinking <i>Holy Fire</i>'s title and imperious cover art indicated that they were continuing down that spacious, grandiose path while using <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"" target=""_blank"">U2</a> as their proverbial North Star. The weakest patches of <i>Holy Fire </i>come when Foals try to repeat ""Spanish Sahara"". Though Flood and Alan Moulder's production is worth every penny and does everything in its power to make <i>Holy Fire </i>spacious and sparkling, ""atmospheric"" Foals tends to obscure melody every bit as much as <i>Antidotes' </i>acrobatics. Likewise, while Philipakkis' voice is becoming more versatile and expressive, his lyrics depersonalize what appear to be very personal songs with stock metaphors: ""I'm the last cowboy in this town,"" ""Every time I see you, I wanna sail away,"" ""It's times like these when I'm on my way out of the woods,"" ""I know I cannot be true/ I'm an animal just like you.""</p>
<p>Though a dead heat in terms of overall quality, and similarly prone to cooling off considerably in its second half, <i>Holy Fire </i>is better proportioned than the top-heavy <i>Total Life Forever</i>. Prior to the nearly beatless and occasionally stirring final 10 minutes, ""Milk and Black Spiders"" slowly builds from a bed of pinprick harmonics to a stirring chorus in <i>Holy Fire's </i>most effective use of the slow build, and ""Providence"" at the very least gives its lyrics some feral embodiment with an ear-grabbing octave-shifted riff.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Holy Fire </i>is undoubtedly a very good, ambitious record, one that operates on an artistic economy of scale, where the lustrous production and singles like ""My Number"" and ""Inhaler"" do the heavy work of confirming Foals' headliner status. The rest has the easy task of proving the Oxford band to be more emotionally substantial and idiosyncratic than any of their mainstream peers. Like <i>Total Life Forever, Holy Fire </i>threatens greatness, and whatever disappointment comes from missing the mark is mitigated by its scope: A bomb needs to be operational more than it needs to be accurate.</p></div>"|17578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17578-holy-fire/|7.6|Ian Cohen

But the Underachievers are a singular presence within the new New York scene. They're not retro-leaning traditionalists like Bada$$, whose <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16864-1999/"" target=""_blank""><i>1999 </i></a>mixtape studiously replicated the vibe of classic 90s New York rap. They're not as aggressively weird as the Flatbush Zombies, and their seriousness of purpose sets them apart from the A$AP Mob's faded party rap. And while many of their contemporaries subscribe to a school of rap that extols the joys of drug use, gleefully cataloguing chemicals consumed, the Underachievers' Issa Dash and Ak treat mind-altering substances like sacraments, like battering rams at the doors of perception. Their debut mixtape, <i>Indigoism</i>, is druggy, but aesthetically so; beneath the surface lies a work of art-damaged mysticism and pyrotechnic wordplay. </p>
<p><i>Indigoism </i>derives many of its psychedelic properties from its production team, the Entreproducers, whose broad palette supplies Issa and Ak with bountiful and bizarre sounds. ""Herb Shuttles"" and ""T.A.D.E.D"" affix spectral keys to the skittering hi-hats and 808s of modern Southern rap. ""So Devilish"" and ""New New York"" are built around menacing psych rock grooves. ""Revelations"" seamlessly marries elements of blues and reggae to trap. <i>Indigoism </i>covers a lot of ground, and there is as much movement within songs as there is between them. ""Leopard Shepard"" chops a muted horn sample no less than three different ways, and songs like ""Gold Soul Theory"" and opener ""Philanthropist"" modulate between divergent verse and chorus sections like a live band would. Even meat-and-potatoes boom bap numbers ""6th Sense"" and ""The Madhi"" sneakily shift melodic elements in and out of the mix as they progress. <i>Indigoism</i>'s one relative constant on the production front is a tendency toward a low BPM.</p>
<p>Slower beats are the perfect launchpad for the breakneck doubletime raps and stop-on-a-dime flow shifts that are the Underachievers' calling card. <i>Indigoism</i>'s dizzying flurry of internal rhymes matches California rap luminaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30353-ab-soul/"" target=""_blank"">Ab-Soul</a> at their most switched on, but where the Black Hippy crew likes to slow things down periodically to air out the rhyme schemes, the Underachievers rarely let up. It's as if they have too much to say without the time to get it all out. The fury of their lyricism also calls back to unsung technicians of 90s rap like Freestyle Fellowship and Organized Konfusion, acts possessed of an almost intimidatingly masterful command of words. This isn't to say that Underachievers' ability to rap very well is a liability, but Issa and Ak's battery of lyrical speed trials occasionally feels one-note when spread over 16 songs. <i>Indigoism </i>clocks in at under an hour, but it feels longer than it is, and is probably most effectively ingested in smaller doses.</p>
<p>After more than a year of sporadic live shows and piecemeal track releases, this full reveal of Underachievers' vision shows a group that's thick with promise. Issa Dash and Ak are intriguing thinkers with formidable mic skills and a team of producers challenging them with moving, breathing soundscapes. In an era rife with aesthetes playing dress up with rap and auteurs who treasure texture and feel over good old-fashioned musicality, the Underachievers are a monument to the complex lyricism and drug-friendly experimentation of Souls of Mischief and the offbeat spirituality of the mystics in the Dungeon Family. But <i>Indigoism </i>isn't really about showing off a good record collection; it's about digesting influences and turning out something vaguely familiar but somehow brand new.</p></div>"|17716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17716-indigoism/|8.0|Craig Jenkins

To which she replied, with exaggerated enthusiasm and perfect comedic timing, ""Thanks!"" It's easy to understand why people were quick to tack ready made labels onto Veronica Falls' sound when they first appeared on the indie pop scene several years ago. There's something familiar and retro-leaning about the London-based quartet-- a band daring to jangle in the long shadow of C86, copping a moody pose that's equally indebted to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"" target=""_blank"">Morrissey</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"" target=""_blank"">the Jesus and Mary Chain</a>. But since their earliest singles, Veronica Falls seem to have figured out the deceptively simple, age-old secret to transcending influences: They just keep writing really good songs.</p>
<p>If people need to put a label on Veronica Falls' sound, Clifford told me when I interviewed her last year that she prefers the phrase ""horror rock""-- a nod to her idol, garage rock pioneer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1356-roky-erickson/"" target=""_blank"">Roky Erickson</a>. (His band, cult favorites the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21083-13th-floor-elevators/"" target=""_blank"">13th Floor Elevators</a>, drew lyrical inspiration from old slasher flicks.) Veronica Falls released a sunny, serviceable cover of Erickson's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11823-starry-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">""Starry Eyes""</a> shortly after they formed in 2009, but it was on their excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15818-veronica-falls-veronica-falls/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a> that they really came into the term. From the magnificently spooky ""Found Love in a Graveyard"" to the abrasive, zombified surf rock of ""Beachy Head"" (an ode to a craggy, coastline cliff in Sussex infamous for its suicides), a thematic chill ran throughout the album. And yet, <i>Veronica Falls</i> had a restraint and tasteful balance you don't often hear on debut records. They knew how to push their goth impulses just enough to be devotedly macabre, but not so far that their smartly arranged songs drowned in kitschy gimmicks. Even their most melodramatic and fantastical tracks like ""Graveyard"" were still grounded by relatable, down-to-earth emotions. </p>
<p>This remains true on the band's second album, <i>Waiting for Something to Happen</i>, which is not a huge departure from the debut but instead a showcase for subtle, wise tune-ups in the band's machinery. The chemistry between Clifford and James Hoare's dueling lead guitars is still strong, and the band's signature multi-part harmonies are as lush as they've ever been. Perhaps the most noticeable change is that <i>Waiting</i> feels like a warmer record. True to its ""horror rock"" ethos, the harmonies on <i>Veronica Falls</i> sometimes sounded like the work of an undead 60s girl group, but here, everybody sounds like they've got a little more color in their cheeks. <i>Waiting</i> still broods with the intensity of teenage love poems, but the approach here is more Romantic than Gothic. These aren't songs about heartbreak caused by ghosts, spirits, or dead poets; they're about the more ordinary variety of heartbreak between real, live people.</p>
<p>As the current rosters of labels like Slumberland and Captured Tracks attest, Veronica Falls aren't the only jangly, guitar-driven band out there that can write a memorable pop hook. What sets them at the head of the pack isn't so much their songwriting chops (though they've definitely got them) as it is the lush, full-screen scope of their sound. This atmosphere sounds fully realized on <i>Waiting for Something to Happen</i>, which was recorded mostly without overdubs and with all four band members playing live in the studio. (Clifford <a href=""http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/veronica-falls-116602"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a> they scrapped some early demos because they ""didn't like how it sounded when we started tracking everything individually."") You can tell Veronica Falls approach the interplay between guitars, bass and drums as carefully as they do their vocal harmonies, and that sense of interlocking group energy gives their sound a roughness, but also fullness and a warmth. You can hear it on the album's most melancholy moment, ""Falling Out"": Clifford paints a solitary scene of ""standing in the headlights, falling in the snow,"" but as her bandmates' instruments and voices join hers in the chorus, that collective energy makes her begin to sound slightly resilient, as if bolstered by the fact that she's no longer alone.</p>
<p>""Everybody's changing, I remain the same,"" Clifford sings on ""Everybody's Changing"", a side B highlight with a chiming melody that sounds like a long lost <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4181-teenage-fanclub/"" target=""_blank"">Teenage Fanclub</a> tune. Whether slyly intentional or not, its title lyric beats the haters to the punch: Veronica Falls haven't changed much in the year-and-a-half since their debut. If you were expecting a bounding artistic leap forward on <i>Waiting</i>, or standalone tracks as immediate and memorable as ""Bad Feeling"" and ""Graveyard"", you might be slightly disappointed that their second record doesn't stray much from their established blueprint. But taken apart from the high expectations set by their debut, <i>Waiting</i> is another strong collection of guitar pop gems from a band quickly proving itself to be a better, more elusive quantity than any easy genre tag might suggest.</p></div>"|17616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17616-waiting-for-something-to-happen/|7.5|Lindsay Zoladz

Lady Susana Walton had been married to the composer Sir William Walton. She created their home, the tropical garden La Mortella, on the Italian island of Ischia, where they lived when the once well regarded musician's star had started to wane. <i>Creatures</i> was a celebration of life and presence, both qualities brought home by its predominant guest star, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4828-my-brightest-diamond/"" target=""_blank"">My Brightest Diamond</a>'s Shara Worden. Its florid, baroque approach was wound down on the partnering <i>Veil Waltz</i> EP, and hushed to a whisper on the <i>Last Song</i> EP, both released later that year as developments and conclusions to the project.</p>
<p>Two-and-a-half years later, we now have <i>The Sundown Song</i> EP, a three-song collection intended as a coda to <i>Creatures</i>, and to <a href=""http://clogs.bandcamp.com/album/the-sundown-song-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mark</a> ""an ending of what Clogs once were as well as a reaffirmation of what they continue to be."" Unlike the other parts of the <i>Creatures</i> world, Padma Newsome is the only member of Clogs to appear on <i>Sundown</i>; Rachael Elliott, Thomas Kozumplik, and <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a>'s Bryce Dessner are absent, though their label <a href=""http://www.brassland.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brassland</a> assures that it's not a permanent change despite the grave accompanying statement. The predominant lyrical theme here is mortality and life cycles-- perhaps in reference to Lady Walton, or transitions within the band-- and the domestic roses on the EP's cover aren't meant to represent La Mortella, but Newsome's own garden at home in Mallacoota, a gorgeous, isolated coastal town in Victoria, Australia.</p>
<p>The intimacy and simplicity of approach is startling: Each of these three songs is based around baritone ukulele (not the clanky kind used by their Brassland labelmates <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30394-buke-and-gase/"" target=""_blank"">Buke and Gase</a>) and Newsome's earnest, moving voice. It would sound folky if it weren't so formal. When I interviewed Newsome about <i>Creatures</i> for <i><a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/04864-clogs-interview-the-creatures-in-the-garden-of-lady-walton"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Quietus</a></i><a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/04864-clogs-interview-the-creatures-in-the-garden-of-lady-walton"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a> in 2010, he used complex musical terminology-- isorhythms, mirror canons, double chases-- and if those processes are present on <i>The Sundown Song</i> EP, they're not as obvious. The low uke skitter on ""A Hobson's Choice"" ebbs around Newsome's tight, whipped vocal intonation, as he sings a perfectly plain song of conversations with friends on the porch, observing small, lolloping marsupials-- but highly strung, as if he had pulled all the threads tight in a piece of cloth. The topic of conversation turns to war and rifle fire and wives that weren't there on the soldiers' return, and suddenly the porch gathering is full of ghosts. A light enveloping of strings coaxes the tension out of the song, but as the ghosts slip away and Newsome's character confides in a friend about his ""plans for the great great plans,"" it's as if he's mocking the point of making any.</p>
<p><i>The Sundown Song</i> EP is the first Clogs release that feels as though it could be performed spontaneously, without the need for microphones or seated applause. The gently ululating ""The World Loves Me"" could be a wry comment on the way humans act as if the world and its myriad beasts should serve them, or it might just be Newsome wandering about his garden, looking out to Mallacoota's crystalline bay and marveling at life on the edge of the earth. The notes he sings always ascend or descend in opposition to the direction of the ukulele, making for a slight uneasiness sharpened by his eerie whistle.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14791-the-sundown-song/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> is a welcome balm to that relative standoffishness. It features the Mallacoota Community Choir, and the depth of their voices balance out Newsome's warmly lilting ukulele for a stirring effect that feels like being able to see the ocean floor clearly. Although the lyrics throughout the EP are quite simple descriptions of time's progression, the prevailing lyrical air of acceptance and of Newsome not wanting to change anything or dress his work up in fancy structures and conceits is unusually moving. ""The people come and the people go/ But I'd rather stay here with you,"" he sings in the final lines of ""The Sundown Song"". It works for the Waltons' relationship, and for Clogs' welcome imperviousness; 12 years of producing precisely what they want, not what they think people want.</p></div>"|17683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17683-the-sundown-song/|6.8|Laura Snapes

Hill's music takes the form of imaginary soundtracks to films that only exist in his mind, primarily inspired by lurid 1970s horror features of wildly varying quality. Last time we heard from him was on the 2012 Rock Action release <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17385-night-has-a-thousand-screams/""><i>Night Has a Thousand Screams</i></a>, an album inspired by a slice n' dice flick from 1982 titled <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082748/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Pieces</i></a>. <i>Screams</i> felt like an endgame for Hill's obsession with the macabre work of Italian composers such as Claudio Simonetti and Fabio Frizzi, ultimately putting him in a position where, three albums into his career, he needed to take those influences and find a musical place of his own to dwell. <i>Confrontations</i> doesn't exactly leave his giallocore tendencies behind, but it does subtly amp up the Italo disco influence that has crept into the Umberto frame, giving it a brilliant sheen that resembles a shift from fleapit to arthouse.</p>
<p>Of course, his prior work as Umberto was all about recreating the feel of slumping down in one of those fleapits, watching a million dismembered limbs fly across the screen through scratchily projected celluloid. Here, the production values are heightened, making it feel like Hill's cinematic diet has expanded. The palpitating groove of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14765-night-fantasy/"">""Night Fantasy""</a> bears similarities to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Giorgio Moroder</a>'s ""Chase"", from <i>Midnight Express</i>: Both tracks are riddled with a dual sense of urgency and abandon, although Umberto's is ultimately more enamored with the kind of 3am cool practiced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"">Chromatics</a> and most of the Italians Do it Better stable. Clearly, there are still traceable lines to be drawn between this music and the work sourced by Hill, but he's bringing in a wider spectrum of influence this time. The light electronics and flattened drum samples of ""Final Revelation"" even edge into the kind of soundtrack territory Harold Faltermeyer was working in during the 80s, albeit with some ghostly vocal chants to anchor it in Umberto's world.</p>
<p>Similar ties proliferate throughout, making <i>Confrontations</i> a baby step forward rather than a thorough overhaul of Hill's sound. When ""Initial Revelation"" enters into a strident synth passage, it becomes his most confident statement yet, playing out like a main title theme begging to be played over scrolling credits. But Hill is wise to keep such moments to a minimum; soundtrack albums often tell their own story, spread out over shifts in mood and space. <i>Confrontations</i> works that way, too. ""Dead Silent Morning"" allows oscillating electronics to coil around one another, imposing a strong sense of trepidation as the intensity is slowly heightened. It's a formula that Hill sticks with throughout the album, starting tracks slow, building up layers, then delivering a payoff that typically involves screaming analog synths. When it works, it can be gloomily affecting. In particular, ""The Invasion"" shows Hill's mastery of restraint, creating a faintly agonizing feeling of anticipation and alarm.</p>
<p>Such tracks are certainly a progression on what came before, but there's still a sense that Hill is a little too enthralled by the work that inspires him. It's possible that he's happy down here-- the forthcoming Umberto tour schedule includes a show at a John Carpenter tribute concert in Geneva, suggesting Hill is at peace with his tendency toward replication. But <i>Confrontations</i> triggers a nagging feeling that he's capable of so much more, particularly when he's mashing up styles on standout tracks like ""Night Fantasy"" and ""Initial Revelation"". <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17492-berberian-sound-studio-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/""><i>Berberian Sound Studio</i></a> showed that there are plenty of fresh ways of looking at the source material from which this record borrows, but after four albums as Umberto it's starting to feel less likely that Hill can find a similar strain of inspiration. Often he feels like a genre director hired for his reliability rather than excelling in his field. Still, there are advances here, a sense that Hill's VHS collection may have expanded beyond the horror section, a step up from pan-and-scan into something approaching widescreen.</p></div>"|17686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17686-confrontations/|6.4|Nick Neyland

Call it <i>Commiseration Rock</i>: Over the past decade, the Philly-via-Allentown band has occupied a very specific niche, making violent, shout-along sludge punk about situations that find men at their wimpiest and most impotent. In Pissed Jeans' songs, men (typically Korvette himself) go bald, can no longer shop happily at Whole Foods, take solace in ice cream, are beleaguered at work, and baffled by women.</p>
<p>Those are very real concerns that nonetheless foster a dangerous perspective from which to create art: It's basically responsible for the rash of deplorable ""manxiety"" sitcoms, which take the defensive and view any deviance from a false ideal of ""father knows best"" society as a threat to God's natural order. Typically, you'd say there's a ""delicate balance"" to be struck with this kind of stuff. On <i>Honeys</i>, Pissed Jeans' fourth and best album, they wisely make no such distinction, trusting the power of honesty in Korvette's lyrics while dropping the musical defense mechanisms that kept listeners at a distance-- it's headbanging music that allows you to nod feverishly in agreement.</p>
<p>So, no more seven-minute dirges about car troubles, no spoken word odes to scrapbooking. That's not to say Pissed Jeans have gone soft on us. You'll get your fill of terror by the second track, as ""Chain Worker"" is three minutes of free-time, squalling feedback surrounding Korvette's screams about a tortured office drone drinking until he cries blood. Otherwise, it's 10 songs (and a brief interlude) that take after the delirious opener ""Bathroom Laughter"" in concision and purpose. Nearly everything could pass for ""the single""-- edge-of-sanity tantrums that make for great singalongs because the chorus is either an exasperated yell or just the song title.<i> </i>Without sacrificing visceral force, Pissed Jeans allow themselves enough versatility to keep <i>Honeys </i>intense and interesting throughout, fashioning a loser's history of alt.rock that honors some of the most abrasive bands to get a deal post-<i>Nevermind</i>; the cruel swing of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2171-jawbox/"" target=""_blank"">Jawbox</a> (""You're Different (In Person)""), the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"" target=""_blank"">Melvins</a>' mammoth plod (""Male Gaze""), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a> themselves going very ape (""Vain in Costume""), and of course, plenty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"" target=""_blank"">the Jesus Lizard</a>'s warped machismo.</p>
<p>The spirit of the music alone positions them as top-flight  <a href=""http://www.amphetaminereptile.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AmRep</a> revivalists, though the relatively clean production makes them sound a little less faithful than labelmates METZ. But this is a necessary decision, as Korvette is a frontman who is trying to communicate with the listener, not just be a part of the abrasive din.<i> Honeys </i>is the most concentrated and consistent display of what Korvette does best. He's reliably quotable largely because his deadpan literalism allows him to be funny without aspiring to cleverness, and lets the ridiculousness of his actions and those of others speak for themselves: a chemically processed, preservative-laden frozen meal calls itself ""Healthy Choice,"" a stick figure family decal on a car proudly boasts one's humility, the friendly ""ding"" accompanying an incoming email reveals the death of a coworker, a lazy boyfriend who thinks his girl should appreciate the effort it takes for him to say ""let's do it.""</p>
<p>In the past, it was easy enough to applaud Pissed Jeans simply for being so overtly topical in a genre that rarely has much to say-- to think, ""Oh, a doom metal song about getting a massage, good one."" While it's clear what each song is specifically <i>about</i> on <i>Honeys</i>, whether that's online dating or cat allergies, they're all essentially dealing with the same thing in a larger sense; the guilt of recognizing the frivolity of your problems and the compounded guilt of recognizing how powerless you are over these stupid things.</p>
<p>""Cafeteria Food"" is closest to the perfect Pissed Jeans song in terms of aligning those two threads. The hollowed-out thud of the kick drum and guitar mirrors how, on the wrong day, a walk down the hallway at work can feel like a death march. It contains the album's best one-liners; upon finding out a shithead project manager has died, Korvette feels ""like I've won the Super Bowl,"" ""like Jesus Christ, our savior,"" and in a line inspired by guitarist Brad Fry's viewing of <i>Maury</i>, ""like I'm not the father."" If it were just an <i>Office Space­-</i>style revenge fantasy, I doubt it would hold up to many listens. There's something more devious at play; notice that Korvette doesn't screw his enemy's wife on his desk, he doesn't take a baseball bat to his fax machine, he doesn't tell him and his fantasy team to fuck off. This is a subtler, dark humor-- here's a guy whose hatred has rendered him so feeble, he's resorted to the futility of begging for divine intervention, resigned to the fact that he'll probably have to make small talk with the same guy in the lunchroom today, tomorrow, and the day after that: ""Go ahead, you can use the microwave/ It's an excellent kitchen tool.""</p>
<p><i>Honeys </i>hits hard and it also stings as it fully explores how lives are driven by fear and the sad little power plays we make to clutch any bit of control. The last two songs are on seemingly different planes: On ""Health Plan"", Korvette refuses to take shit or (any helpful medical advice) from doctors, and later disappears into his DVD collection on ""Teenage Adult"". But they're both unflinching looks at how people frame their willingness to endanger their wellbeing as principles rather than serious denial. This is even more pronounced on the ""relationship"" songs; far from an Al Bundy homage, the laughs of ""Romanticize Me"" are uncomfortably triggered by the acknowledged, pathetic co-dependency where one person refuses to change, the other refuses to leave, and you sit at dinner with the couple wondering how they ever found each other attractive. ""You're Different (In Person)"" is similar in that it doesn't deconstruct social media so much as let it speak for its own devolutionary power; from the excitement of setting up that perfect profile to the realization that the internet allows shut-ins an even higher level of deceit, manipulation, and stunted emotions than ""real life."" When Korvette yells, ""I thought this was meant to be fun!"" he outlines the sad truth that most people <i>aren't </i>different in person.</p>
<p>The cartoonish brutality of the music is fun as hell, and since Korvette is most often mocking himself during <i>Honeys, </i>it doesn't come off as hectoring. This is extremely important on ""Male Gaze"". Most often, songs by men decrying misogyny try to speak on behalf of <i>all</i> men (or all women, really), and turn into condescension. It might help that ""Male Gaze"" takes the most caricatured, simian path musically, but Korvette simply acknowledges the unintended consequences of his actions (""It's when a smile becomes a stare/ And it starts to burn"") and apologizes. He doesn't ask for or assume forgiveness, he doesn't place himself on a pedestal and he doesn't indict his entire gender so you might think more highly of him. Korvette artlessly mutters, ""I know I'm no angel/ But I'm trying to kill it,"" admitting to progress in a way that's more powerful than feigning perfection.</p>
<p>Pissed Jeans can often be mistaken for a misanthropic band, especially since<i> Hope for Men </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13360-king-of-jeans/"" target=""_blank""><i>King of Jeans </i></a>came equipped with enough self-sabotage to keep their underdog status intact. But when I call it ""Commiseration Rock"", it's because <i>Honeys </i>focuses on dealing with other people to an extent that's extremely rare. Not ""<i>how</i> to deal with people""-- <i>Honeys </i>is thankfully not a treatise, not a moral code, not a series of op-ed pieces trying to convert you to Korvette's point of view, and it acknowledges that the zero-sum games of ""fuck the man"" punk idealism don't work for most people who have real jobs and bills. It's just a kickass rock record that presents Korvette in a way most of us can relate to, a guy trying to blow off steam after another exhausting, barely successful attempt to not be an asshole one day at a time.</p></div>"|17581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17581-honeys/|8.1|Ian Cohen

He has released volumes of material as a solo artist and with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2929-engineers/"" target=""_blank"">Engineers</a>, much of it tied to the ambient pop drift of early 1990s shoegaze. Schnauss deserves some credit for forecasting the heady, frosting-thick synthesizer music of bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>, but there's no getting away from the fact that little of his work bears revisiting. It's been six years since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7026-far-away-trains-passing-by/"" target=""_blank"">a review here said</a> Schnauss' music ""begs for a riskier approach"", so it's doubly difficult to announce that while <i>A Long Way to Fall</i> meaningfully alters Schnauss' approach for the first time, he still comes up empty handed.</p>
<p>Schnauss <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1687"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">admitted in an interview last year</a> that this change of direction was intentional: ""My music taste changes every eight to ten years I think, and I was getting a bit bored with [that synthesized shoegaze sound]."" <i>Fall</i> finds Schnauss ditching the limp vocals and siccing his impressive gear collection on slowly unfurling ribbons of melody, which he fits against beaming pads and gentlemanly rhythms. The thrust of his music hasn't changed. Schnauss makes inviting, optimistic music; ""pretty"" is still the noble but limited goal. There is a newfound clarity and separation to the mix, though, clear demarcations between his celestial yellows and terracotta oranges.</p>
<p><i>A Long Way to Fall</i> wants to undo some of the persistent criticisms of Schnauss' music: that it is indefinite, without substance. Instead, it confirms them, condemning Schnauss as an eager tinkerer with great taste but terrible instincts. <i>Fall</i> is an ill-at-ease collection of midtempo electronic cheese. It is weightless, light music, like Schnauss skimmed the foam off the top of the ocean, leaving the roar, agitation, and murk behind. Even armed with an encyclopedia of genre names and a phone book of similar artists, you would have trouble explaining what <i>Fall</i> is. It touches base with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12663-air-france/"" target=""_blank"">Air France</a>, but <i>Fall</i> cares little for nostalgia or youth. It doesn't fade into the background or throttle you; it sits leaden in the middle of the room.</p>
<p><i>Fall</i>'s worst moments are queasy and charmless. Offenders include the title track and the comically turbulent ""The Weight of Darkening Skies"". Every ability, every emotion, must be wrangled and displayed; no one can be offended. This is <i>Fall</i>'s lot: breadth without purpose, clarity without detail. That Schnauss flounders this way after his first artistic shift in a decade is discouraging. He has always seemed thoughtful and passionate-- <a href=""http://www.xlr8r.com/podcast/2013/01/ulrich-schnauss"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a recent podcast for XLR8R</a> explores drum &amp; bass, and is a lot of fun. Now, as in the past, though, Schnauss' devotion and care outpace the quality of his output.</p></div>"|17584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17584-a-long-way-to-fall/|4.3|Andrew Gaerig

<p>For his new record <i>No Beginning No End</i>, he’s staying true to that wanderlust, enlisting musicians like bassist Pino Palladino (who famously helped construct neosoul gems like D’Angelo’s <i>Voodoo</i> as well as Erykah Badu’s <i>Mama’s Gun</i>) and contemporary jazz star Robert Glasper as well as Franco-Moroccan singer Hindi Zahra. While he’s always been one to try stuff out-- he successfully collaborated with Flying Lotus on <i>Blackmagic</i>--on <i>No Beginning No End </i>he finds a way to make an eclectic approach feel unified and whole. </p>
<p>James sings with a steely grace that does in fact recall D’Angelo, a quality only reinforced by Palladino’s fingerprint on songs like the grooving opener “It’s All Over Your Body” and the back half’s soul clap “Make It Right”. But James’ more detached voice isn’t the weapon that D’Angelo’s proves to be, if you’re looking at <i>No Beginning No End</i> as a spiritual cousin of <i>Voodoo</i> or <i>Mama’s Gun.</i> While James’ record prizes overarching vibe over song-to-song substance, it’s more subdued and, in a sense, more unpredictable: the opener cedes to the hand drum cool-out “Sword + Gun”, which builds to the straightforward pop reach on the record, the taut “Trouble”, which in turn slides into Robert Glasper and James’ capital J jazz tribute “Vanguard”, a tribute to the Greenwich Village institution where the song was devised.</p>
<p>Though that sounds like a lot of hopping around-- the poppy, percussive midalbum standout “Come to My Door” is another good example-- <i>No Beginning No End</i> works smoothly as a suite, which is a testament to James shape-shifting nature as well as the session musicians' willingness to stay in a support role. While one could see the temptation to push further into a pop crossover sweet-spot, <i>No Beginning No End</i> contains few heavy brush strokes. Though James’ meandering gets the best of him on the slow shuffle “Bird of Space” and the never-quite-gets-there “Untitled” echo “Do You Feel”, even when he misses his low-key restraint retains its charm. </p>
<p>Though <i>No Beginning No End </i>succeeds in its laid-back approach, make no mistake that James is seeking to bust out of the NPR Jazz world and into the ears of new audiences. In March, he'll play Music Hall of Williamsburg, Bowery Presents' Brooklyn hype thermometer (also playing that month: Sky Ferreira, How to Dress Well,  Savages, Django Django), just a 20-minute train ride from the Village Vanguard but a world away. With previous releases, he's earned his heroic acclaim in the tough, tried-and-trusted lanes of contemporary jazz. With <i>No Beginning No End</i>, he's built his own road out.</p></div>"|17687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17687-no-beginning-no-end/|7.4|Corban Goble

And for good reason, as K-X-P are band not to be trusted, perhaps even feared. Take the Finnish group's regrettably overlooked but excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14500-k-x-p/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled 2010 debut</a>, which orbited a smorgasbord of maximalist pop fragments around lockstep motorik rhythms, ultimately leaving brains pleasantly gooped like a sous-vide egg. But it's with <i>II</i> that the self-proclaimed ""anti-band"" has taken things to a new level, as Kaukolampi has attested to infusing their sound with ""free jazz, drone, noise, pop, rock,"" with an overall emphasis on trying to tap into something ""more punk."" He's even adopted a sort of alter ego, combining the personalities of ""a lunatic occult reverend, a yoga teacher, John Lydon, Freddie Mercury and Rob Halford."" Because why not? For a band that should've gotten your attention the first time around, there's no better time to fly off the handle a little bit than with your sophomore release.</p>
<p>K-X-P aren't bullshitting you; <i>II</i> is both more ambitious and vaster in scope than its predecessor, a record that pushes their most far-out tendencies to their respective limits. It is, however, less extreme than Kaukolampi's screeds would have you believe, assuredly the work of a band now very different than from the one that made <i>K-X-P</i>. A set of austere horns leads you into the album's first proper track and single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14652-melody/"" target=""_blank"">""Melody""</a>, as arpeggiations chatter back and forth in ways that will likely remind you of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15055-zonoscope/"" target=""_blank"">last Cut Copy full-length</a>. Once the rhythm section locks in place (this is a band that features two drummers, after all), majestic synths build, and the track morphs into something of a coronation, an almost goofy baptismal. It's clear that K-X-P are a band newly unencumbered, beholden to no specific guiding principles. It's this sense of freedom that makes <i>II</i> an engaging, at times very exciting listen, but it also doesn't lead to much cohesion. K-X-P spend most of their time with their heads barely above water, but instead of merely treading, it feels as if they're betting alongside you as to whether or not they'll eventually go under. Needless to say, there's action to be had, and the results are always unexpected.</p>
<p>As a record peppered with tiny little interludes (a snatch of opera runs backwards, synths plink like drops of water, etc.) that stitch things together loosely, it's clear that this recording is intended to be approached as a kind of journey. To paraphrase Robert Downey Jr., you never go full prog, but K-X-P's could-give-a-fuck-ness often trumps the pitfalls of similarly minded efforts. A good portion of these songs do sound like miniature campaigns, chugging forward at various intervals, often as sprawling as <i>K-X-P</i> was tightly coiled. But the heartbeat at the core of <i>II</i> is a human one, rising and falling as dictated by the chaos or heady expanse of these varied environments. So it makes sense that there are now vocals on every proper track, and while they may not always be the wisest inclusion, it's hard to fault Kaukolampi and co. for working outside of their comfort zone.</p>
<p>Much of <i>II</i> exists in a sort of quasi-mythical realm, where medieval chants and regal, rapturous melodies are meant to overwhelm. ""In the Valley"" reads like a fairytale (featuring vocals from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/224-annie/"" target=""_blank"">Annie</a>, who Kaukolampi has written and produced for), while ""Tears (Extended Interlude)"" and ""Staring at the Moon"" both share a kind of medieval quality (the latter tossing a little Laser Floyd action for good measure). These tracks aren't the strongest K-X-P have ever produced, but their extensive detailing and pervading sense of humor don't render them disposable, either. The real issue is that there isn't enough drama in the ways they build; like closer ""Dark Satellite"", the next stop always seems to be nowhere, which can feel a little tedious after so long.</p>
<p>But <i>II</i> can get really juiced up on itself, and when it does, there's not much that can get in it's way. K-X-P are a band that's infinitely more dynamic when driven by rhythm, and there a plenty of examples to prove that point here. ""Magnetic North"", an ode to the band's home country, sounds a lot like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzORu1dqEE0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Life During Wartime""</a>, cut with just a hint of sinister Nordic doom. ""Satan is lord,"" gargles Kaukolampi, as a group of children cheer emphatically behind him. ""For those who are bored,"" he finishes dryly. More congruent with both halves of <i>II</i>'s personality is the boisterous, punked-up ""Flags and Crosses"", but ""Easy (Infinity Waits)"" is the real winner, a stomping monster of a tune that's only drawback is that it isn't twice as long (luckily, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12326-easy-infinity-waits/"" target=""_blank"">an extended version</a> appeared on 2011's <i>Easy</i> EP). It's thanks to these big highlights that <i>II</i> becomes a record you walk away from only remembering the best parts, as they largely overshadow all else. It's a skewed take for sure, but like most of what K-X-P do well, an impressive act of sorcery nonetheless.</p></div>"|17659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17659-ii/|7.0|Zach Kelly

For the last quarter century, the California group has blended massive atmospherics with steely-eyed ferocity, resulting in albums of grand arches and, at best, total immersion. Part of the delight, though, is tracing the band's stepwise development during their era; antithetical to the pervasive indie culture quip of ""I liked their earlier stuff better,"" seldom few Neurosis fans would argue that the band arrived fully formed. Rather, their most foundational records appeared in their second decade as a unit (see, debatably, the Relapse era, from 1996 until 2001). And when I interviewed the band last year about their very good 10th album, <i>Honor Found in Decay</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/9000-for-the-rest-of-our-lives/"">Steve Von Till said</a> that Neurosis was still working to develop and explore new techniques. ""Rather than get set in our ways or find anything too comfortable, we find these new places to exist,"" he said, explaining that some of his favorite parts on the latest record stemmed not from the typical loud guitars but instead from keyboard player Noah Landis. For Von Till, Neurosis' emphasis on long-run evolution rather than short-term aberrations was a clear point of pride, a practical ideal to suit their musical aesthetic.</p>
<p>One clear heir to both Neurosis' sprawling post-metal cycles and their persistent development as an ensemble is Sweden's Cult of Luna. Like their transoceanic predecessors, Cult of Luna is as much a posse as a band, with seven members integrated into the fold over the last 14 years. And like Neurosis, they started simply as a viscous, belligerent metal band (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OMB00RWj6Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">see the great ""Sleep""</a>, from their 2001 debut); with ambition and gusto, they have slowly augmented their sounds and approaches, not only incorporating electronics but also warping expectations of structure and form. That process, as one might imagine, hasn't been without its missteps. <i>The Beyond</i>, from 2003, had its moments, but the band's attempts to infuse electronics were sometimes coltish and awkward, like a nü metal band trying to transgress into a more sophisticated mold.</p>
<p>But their sixth album, this year's <i>Vertikal</i>, serves as proof positive that, even after more than a decade, Cult of Luna remains a promising and dynamic enterprise. Recorded in sessions that stretched for more than a year, <i>Vertikal</i> hinges upon Cult of Luna's ability to have the band's machine and men play nice. At its best, it finds a surprising middle ground between Deftones and Neurosis, and that seems to have been part of the point. As co-founder Johannes Persson <a href=""http://www.attnmagazine.co.uk/feature/6213"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told Britain’s <i>ATTN: magazine</i></a>, electronics served as a vital piece of the writing process for the first time on <i>Vertikal</i>, not a tacked-on and late textural addition. ""On <i>Eternal Kingdom</i>,"" he said, referencing the band's 2008 album, ""we tried to have the electronics in mind when we wrote, but we couldn't do that in the same sense. ...We put the layer electronics on top, but this time we had the electronics while we were writing. It made a huge impact.""</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>Vertikal</i>'s moments of synthesis unveil remarkably progressive doom, putting the surly form in uncomfortable positions and often finding a payload. ""I: The Weapon"" is an aggressive march, with a sharp and long riff that’s treated like an epic voyage. At one point near its midsection, Cult of Luna swaps the strings for a rubbery dubstep backbone. That might <i>read</i> terribly, but it’s as exhilarating as it is unexpected. In the coda, distorted guitars linger over and wrap around crackling keyboards. ""The Sweep"", the album's shortest non-instrumental track, is a brutal burst of industrial pop, with the warped pulses and sinews of noise waging war against the mutilated vocals. Cult of Luna's metal pedigree provides texture and depth; their interest in corroding their limits provides the inspiration. And on the beautiful, patient closer ""Passing Through"", the twinkles of glockenspiel and the sheets of digitally tweaked crooning float above sinister guitars set on an infinite loop. Previously, Cult of Luna's sideshow forays detracted from their bulkhead of heaviness; here, they serve as reinforcement.           </p>
<p><i>Vertikal </i>is an interesting and accomplished hybrid, but it isn't perfect. In fact, it works best on a track-by track basis, though the record clearly aims to be its own holistic, all-encompassing universe. Persson says Fritz Lang's early sci-fi horror <i>Metropolis</i> served as a stylistic inspiration for an album ""that was going to sound like a 'factory.'"" After a dozen trips through, though, the sequencing and transitions still feel ineffective. The prelude ""The One"" doesn't funnel into what would have been the more daring gambit, ""I: The Weapon"". And the end of ""Mute Departure"" and the beginning of ""In Awe Of"" have nothing to do with the interlude that divides them, a 45-second synthesizer piece that seems to summon the legacy of Laurie Spiegel only as a perfunctory demonstration of erudition.</p>
<p>Brevity isn’t a thing that Cult of Luna knows well, either. These 65 minutes are a median length for a band that’s consistently guilty of conflating quantity with quality. The distended build that opens the 19-minute ""Vicarious Redemption"" demands an edit that it doesn’t get; as is, some of the heaviest and best moments on the record, when the septet works in perfectly combustible unity, get diluted by the deep slog that surrounds them. But that's the risk of unrest, isn't it? Had Cult of Luna attempted to make the same record six times during the last decade, maybe they would have condensed it into a tight 30 minutes by now. That would be neither captivating nor interesting, though, and <i>Vertikal</i> is quite often both.  </p></div>"|17679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17679-vertikal/|6.8|Grayson Currin

Upon its release in 1977, it became the fastest-selling LP of all time, moving 800,000 copies per week at its height, and its success made Fleetwood Mac a cultural phenomenon. The million-dollar record that took a year and untold grams to complete became a totem of 1970s excess, rock'n'roll at its most gloriously indulgent. It was also a bellwether of glimmering Californian possibility, the permissiveness and entitlement of the 70s done up in heavy harmonies. By the time it was made, the personal freedoms endowed by the social upheaval of the 60s had unspooled into unfettered hedonism. As such, it plays like a reaping: a finely polished post-hippie fallout, unaware that the twilight hour of the free love era was fixing and there would be no going back. In 1976, there was no knowledge of AIDS, Reagan had just left the governor's manse, and people still thought of cocaine as non-addictive and strictly recreational. <i>Rumours</i> is a product of that moment and it serves as a yardstick by which we measure just how 70s the 70s were. </p>
<p>And then there's the album's influence. Though it was seen as punk's very inverse, <i>Rumours</i> has enjoyed a long trickle-down of influence starting from the alt-rock-era embrace via <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=v832qFcLRac"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Billy Corgan</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CYB5V9e64"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Courtney Love </a>to the harmonies and choogling of Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy and the earthier end of Beach House. <i>Rumours</i> set a template for pop with a gleaming surface that has something complicated, desperate, and dark resonating underneath. </p>
<p>Setting aside the weight of history, listening to <i>Rumours</i> is an easy pleasure. Records with singles that never go away tend to evoke nostalgia for the time when the music soundtracked your life; in this case, you could've never owned a copy of it and still know almost every song. When you make an album this big, your craft is, by default, accessibility. But this wasn't generic pabulum. It was personal. Anyone could find a piece of themselves within these songs of love and loss.</p>
<p>Two years prior to recording <i>Rumours</i>, though, Fleetwood Mac was approximately nowhere. In order to re-establish the group's flagging stateside reputation, in early 1974 Fleetwood Mac's drummer and band patriarch, Mick Fleetwood, keyboardist/singer Christine McVie, and her husband, bassist John McVie, moved from England to Los Angeles. The quartet was then helmed by their fifth and least-dazzling guitarist, the American Bob Welch. Not long after the band's British faction had relocated, Welch quit the band. Around the same time Mick Fleetwood was introduced to the work of local duo, Buckingham Nicks, who'd just been dropped by Polydor. The drummer was enchanted by Lindsey Buckingham's guitar work and Nicks' complete package, and when Welch quit, he offered them a spot in the band outright. </p>
<p>The group, essentially a new band under an old name, quickly cut 1975's self-titled <i>Fleetwood Mac</i>, an assemblage of Christine McVie's songs and tracks Buckingham and Nicks had intended for their second album, including the eventual smash ""Rhiannon"". It was a huge seller in its own right and they were now a priority act given considerable resources. But by the time they booked two months at <a href=""http://plantstudios.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Record Plant</a> in Sausalito to record the follow-up, the band's personal bonds were frayed, there was serious resentment and constant drama. Nicks had just broken up with Buckingham after six years of domestic and creative partnership. Fleetwood's wife was divorcing him, and the McVies were separated and no longer speaking.</p>
<p>While <i>Fleetwood Mac</i> was a bit of a mash-up of existing work, Lindsey Buckingham effectively commandeered the band for <i>Rumours</i>, giving their sound a radio-ready facelift. He redirected John McVie and Fleetwood's playing from blues past towards the pop now. Fleetwood Mac wanted hits and gave the wheel to Buckingham, a deft craftsman with a vision for what the album had to become.</p>
<p>He opens the record with the libidinous ""Second Hand News"", inspired by the redemption Buckingham was finding in new women, post-Stevie. It was the album's first single and also perhaps the most euphoric ode to rebound chicks ever written. Buckingham's ""bow-bow-bow-doot-doo-diddley-doot"" is corny, but it works along with the percussion track (Buckingham played the seat of an office chair after Fleetwood was unable to properly replicate a beat a la the Bee Gees' ""Jive Talkin'""). Like ""Second Hand News"", Buckingham's ""Go Your Own Way"" is upbeat but totally fuck-you. He croons ""shackin' up is all you wanna do,""-- accusing an ex-lover of being a wanton slut on a song where his ex-lover harmonizes on the hook. Save for ""Never Going Back Again,"" (a vintage Buckingham Nicks composition brought in to replace Stevie's too-long ""Silver Springs"") Buckingham's songs are turnabout as fairplay with lithe guitar glissando on top.</p>
<p>""Second Hand News"" is followed by a twist-of-the-knife Stevie-showpiece, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEi7GPkxfsE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dreams</a>"", a gauzy ballad about what she'd had and what she'd lost with Buckingham. It was written during one of the days where Nicks wasn't needed for tracking. She wrote the song in a few minutes, recorded it onto a cassette, and returned to the studio and demanded the band listen to it. It was a simple ballad that would be finessed into the album's jewel; the quiet vamp laced with laconic Leslie-speaker vibrato and spooky warmth allow Nicks to draw an exquisite sketch of loneliness. ""Dreams"" would become Fleetwood Mac's only #1 hit.</p>
<p>Though Fleetwood Mac was always the sum of its parts, Nicks was something special both in terms of the band and in rock history. She helped establish a feminine vernacular that was (still) in league with the cock rock of the 70s but didn't present as a diametric vulnerability; it was not innocent. While Janis Joplin and Grace Slick had been rock's most iconic heroines at the tail-end of the 60s, they were very much trying to keep up with boys in their world; Nicks was creating a new space. And Fleetwood Mac was still very much an anomaly, unique in being a rock band fronted by two women who were writing their own material, with Nicks presenting as the girliest bad girl rock'n'roll had seen since Ronnie Spector. She took the stage baring a tambourine festooned with lengths of lavender ribbon; people said she was a witch.</p>
<p>Like her male rock'n'roll peers, Nicks sang songs about the intractable power of a woman (her first hit, ""Rhiannon"") and used women as a metaphor (""Gold Dust Woman""), but her approach was different. At the time of <i>Rumours</i>' release, she maintained that the latter song was about groupies who would scowl at her and Christine but light up when the guys appeared. She later confessed that it was about cocaine getting the best of her. In 1976, coke was the mise of the scene-- to admit you were growing weary would have been gauche. Nicks' husky voice made it sound like she'd lived and her lyrics-- of pathos, independence, and getting played-- certainly backed it up. She seemed like a real woman-- easy to identify with, but with mystery and a natural glamour worth aspiring to.</p>
<p>It's almost easy to miss Christine McVie for all of Nicks' mystique. McVie had been in the band for years, but never at the helm. Her songs ""You Make Lovin' Fun"" and ""Don't Stop"" are pure pep. ""Songbird"" starts as a plaintive ode of fealty and how total her devotion-- until the sad tell of ""And I wish you all the love in the world/ But most of all I wish it from myself,"" (an especially heart-wrenching line given that McVie's not quite ex-husband was dragging a rebound model chick to the sessions and Christine was sneaking around with a member of the crew). She didn't hate her husband, she adored him, she wished it could work but after years of being in the Mac together, she knew better. Throughout, McVie's songwriting is pure and direct, irrepressibly sweet. ""Oh Daddy"", a song she wrote about Mick Fleetwood's pending divorce is melancholy but ultimately maintains its dignity. McVie, with typical British reserve, confessed she preferred to leave the bleakness and poesy to her dear friend Stevie.</p>
<p>As much feminine energy as <i>Rumours</i> wields, the album's magic is in its balance: male and female, British blues versus American rock'n'roll, lightness and dark, love and disgust, sorrow and elation, ballads and anthems, McVie's sweetness against Nicks' grit. They were a democratic band where each player raised the stakes of the whole. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks and McVie's new prominence kicked John McVie's bass playing loose from its blues mooring and forced him towards simpler, more buoyant pop. Fleetwood's playing itself is just godhead, with effortless little fills, light but thunderous, and his placement impeccable throughout. The ominous, insistent kick on the first half on ""The Chain"", for example, colors the song as much as the quiver of disgust in Buckingham's voice when he spits ""never.""</p>
<p>In the liner notes to the deluxe <i>Rumours</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48920-fleetwood-macs-classic-rumours-reissued/"" target=""_blank"">4xCD/DVD/LP box set</a>, Buckingham describes the album-making process as ""organic."" <i>Rumours</i> is anything but, and that is part of its genius-- it's so flawless it feels far from nature. It is more like a peak human feat of Olympic-level studio craft. It was made better by its myopia and brutal circumstances: the wounded pride of a recently dumped Buckingham, the new hit of ""Rhiannon"", goading Nicks to fight for inclusion of her own songs, Christine McVie attempting to salve her heart with ""Songbird."" That <i>Fleetwood Mac</i> had become the biggest record Warner Bros. had ever released while the band was making <i>Rumours</i> allowed for an impossibly long tether for them to dick around and correct the next album until it was immaculate.</p>
<p>Given the standalone nature of <i>Rumours</i>, it's difficult to argue that any other part of the box set is necessary. The live recordings of the <i>Rumours</i> tour are fine, lively even (perhaps owing to Fleetwood rationing a Heineken cap of coke to each band member to power performances). Only a handful of tracks on the two discs of the sessions outtakes lend any greater understanding of the process behind it. One is ""Dreams (Take 2)"", which is just Nicks voice, some burbling organ, and rough rhythm guitar gives an appreciation of her fundamental talent as well as Buckingham's ability to transform it; it makes the case for how much they needed each other. Another is ""Second Hand News (Early Take)"", which features Buckingham mumbling lyrics so as not to incense Nicks. The alternate mixes and takes (more phaser! Less Dobro! Take 22!), by the time you make it to disc four, just underscore the fact that Rumours did not hatch as a pristine whole. One does not need three variously funky articulations of Christine's burning ""Keep Me There"" to comprehend this.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is difficult not to buy into the mythology of <i>Rumours</i> both as an album and pop culture artifact: a flawless record pulled from the wreckage of real lives. As one of classic rock's foundational albums, it holds up better than any other commercial smash of that ilk (<i>Hotel California</i>, certainly). We can now use it as a kind of nostalgic benchmark-- that they don't make groups like that anymore, that there is no rock band so palatable that it could be the best-selling album in the U.S. for 31 weeks. Things work differently now. Examined from that angle, <i>Rumours</i> was not exactly a game changer, it was merely perfect.</p></div>"|17499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17499-rumours/|10.0|Jessica Hopper

After all, back when they were featured players on Kode9's Hyperdub label, the London-based duo of James Young and Aiden Whalley won all sorts of looks for their wonky but thoughtfully-crafted strain of dubstep. The subsequent addition of vocalist James Buttery appeared to position Darkstar at the forefront of a generation of dance acts looking to marry vocals and textured dance sounds in a novel and original way. The ensuing ""Aidy's Girl is a Computer"" seemed like a bellwether-- for a good six months, it felt like Darkstar was the thinking person's [insert your favorite mildly popular dubstep act from 2009 here]-- on-paper darlings with just the right amount of heat, clearly about to have a moment.</p>
<p>But a funny thing happened on the way to that moment; Darkstar got soft. Not soft soppy-- although this album's detractors might argue that, too-- but soft sonically. Even with Buttery in the fold, a major throughline of 2010's <i>North</i> was Darkstar's constant fascination with how different drum patterns locked together-- a big part of the fun was how they rationalized that into vocalist-led song structures. <i>News From Nowhere</i> is so unbothered by rhythmic invention that it might as well be from a different band. The keening falsettos, new age pads, and chiming bell sounds that signal opener ""Light Body Clock Starter"" establish an instructive new message that never really fades away: these guys are crooners now, less 2-step than ""2 become 1"".</p>
<p>You know what, though? This new hairdo doesn't look half bad. Setting aside the occasional meandering instrumental break, there are enough genuinely charming and well-crafted songs here that you can sort of understand what they're aiming at. Sure, by embracing more established pop and indie song structures, Darkstar risk opening themselves up to a world of new comparisons, but to their credit, they also seem to relish the moments when they catch themselves wearing another band's clothes. One of the album's best tracks, ""A Day's Pay For a Day's Work"" features a melody line that sounds like it could have lifted straight out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a>'s playbook. Elsewhere, the hiccuping acoustics, low baritone and pneumatic rhythm section of ""Armonica"" constitutes a pretty convincing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/249-matthew-dear/"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Dear</a> callback. And then there's ""Amplified Ease"", a studiously shambolic and very likable sing-song which, as an aside, I'm pretty sure is scientifically traceable to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>.</p>
<p>It's fun to think about Darkstar's raw materials and what they might do with them one day, but nobody's going to come away from <i>News From Nowhere</i> feeling like they've successfully cultivated their own unique universe. Perhaps in the grand scheme of things, this might end up being thought of as a necessary transition album that bridges some new future territory for them. But even as a functional exercise in sensitive songs and electronic pastels, you could do much worse.</p></div>"|17575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17575-news-from-nowhere/|7.0|Mark Pytlik

Most of the record is given over to edgy dance-rap hybrids and edgier electronic psychedelia, but in the moments that his vision snaps into focus-- including but not limited to the addictively skronky, twerk-worthy single ""Wut""-- he turns into a pop star waiting to happen. On <i>Fly Zone</i>, his full-length follow-up to <i>Dark York</i> that comes on the heels of a collaborative EP with his producer Boody, he seems determined to make that transition.</p>
<p>Even just a couple of years ago the idea of a rapper with such a strongly avant-garde sensibility-- not to mention one that's openly gay-- bent on crossing over with a mainstream audience would have seemed like a cruel joke. But the hip-hop mainstream has been steadily catching up with its artsy leading edge, so that someone like Clams Casino can go from being an obscure producer with a sui generis aesthetic and a SoundCloud page to prominent placement on marquee major label albums in what seemed like no time.</p>
<p>Le1f’s forthright about his ambitions. He dedicates the album’s third track, ""Cloud So Loud"", to college kids, suburbs, the projects, and clubs ""with no basic bitches at the function,"" a broad and demographically diverse swath of pop culture consumers who he intends to win over to his side. The beat, produced by the evocatively named DJ Blood Everywhere, is frenetic, booming, and probably sounds amazing being played too loud over a club P.A., so the idea of Le1f attracting that kind of audience is far from unfeasible. In that context, its use of a snippet of the same vocal sample from Super Beagle's ""Dust a Soundboy"" that Kanye and Lifted based the beat to last summer’s megasmash ""Mercy"" around is both aspirational and hella cheeky.</p>
<p>""Cloud So Loud"" isn't the only overtly ambitious moment on <i>Fly Zone</i>, but unlike most goal-oriented mixtape rappers, Le1f wisely prefers to show his crossover potential rather than to rap about it. On <i>Dark York</i> his vocal performances tended to be about as spacey as the beats behind them, but since then his flow has developed a heft and muscularity that it lacked before, as if he's only just now figuring out what his limber vocal chords are capable of, which includes everything from deep, unexpectedly Tupac-like growls to a girlish squeal that he sometimes deploys during punchlines. His lyrics are stronger too. ""Airbending"" boasts the line, ""I am whatever you say I am/ Stop worrying about how gay I am,"" where the fact that it's a flip of an Eminem lyric is followed quickly by the realization that a rapper quoted one of pop's most virulent homophobes to reaffirm his gayness, which is a brilliant demonstration of conceptual judo.</p>
<p><i>Fly Zone</i>'s production is similarly more coherent than <i>Dark York</i>'s. There's still enough weirdness to satisfy Le1f's more psychedelically inclined fans (including ""Psy Lock"", which is one of the trippiest odes to cybersex ever recorded), but he seems more inclined now to borrow ideas from mainstream rap music, even if he ends up turning them inside out. Standout track ""Spa Day"" sounds like the result of an MDMA-fueled encounter between dubstep and trap rap. (The hook where Le1f wishes us ""mazel tov"" is prone to looping endlessly in the brain long after the song is over.) ""The Whip"", featuring Haleek Maul, is even more traditional, with a beat that delivers an almost eerily accurate reproduction of early-90s g-funk.</p>
<p>All in all, <i>Fly Zone</i> is an epically audacious record, boiling down to essentially a 13-track demand from Le1f to be allowed access to a mainstream audience without sacrificing a shred of the identity that sets him apart from nearly every rapper a mainstream audience has been drawn to. Will Le1f be able to have his cake and eat it, too? I have a feeling we'll find out by his next installment.</p></div>"|17682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17682-fly-zone/|7.8|Miles Raymer

The Canadian singer-songwriter caused a brief buzz back in the mid 1990s with his debut, <i>Everything I Long For</i>, a minor alt-folk release in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3733-sebadoh/"" target=""_blank"">Sebadoh</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a> vein. Since then, however, he hasn't had a hit song or a big album, nor has he shown up on a soundtrack or in a major ad campaign. His lyrics are precise and expressive, but he's not really a songwriter's songwriter. His range is limited, but he's not a cult artist either. In fact, his music tends to be understated to a fault: slow and mopey and not always reliable, like ca. 96 dial-up. And yet, here we are, talking about his latest effort, <i>Us Alone</i>. </p>
<p>This is his seventh album in 17 years, which is something. More importantly, it's his first release through the Canadian label Arts &amp; Crafts, home to Broken Social Scene and all of its many offshoots. Such a signing could prompt some pop history revisionism, casting Hayden alongside some of his new labelmates as foundational to Toronto's indie rock scene. Sure, his music bears some superficial similarities to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1622-feist/"" target=""_blank"">Feist</a>, who also started out in the 90s. But he lacks her subdued spryness and-- more crucially-- her sense of melody; the relative quiet of her music conceals unruly emotions and provides a setting for her sonic experiments. Hayden is nowhere near as idiosyncratic. In fact, his closest contemporary analog might just be the likewise drowsy-voiced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4553-m-ward/"" target=""_blank"">M. Ward</a>, except without his throwback sensibilities and-- more crucially-- his sense of melody.  </p>
<p>Despite the new label, Hayden hasn't beefed up his sound on <i>Us Alone</i>. Instead, he's pared down even more. He recorded these songs almost entirely by himself in his home studio, playing all of the instruments and emphasizing a live, textured sound that he says he hopes will be easier to replicate onstage. Even with fewer hands playing fewer instruments, the songs nevertheless sound leaden, ponderous, drowsy. Still, there are some inspired flourishes, like the hesitating guitar riff on ""Rainy Saturday"" or the church organ on ""Oh Memory"" or the vocals by Lou Canon on ""Blurry Nights"". She's a lively presence on the song, and her breathily expressive delivery makes her a good foil for the deadpan Hayden. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Opener ""Motel"" actually starts strong as Hayden describes a tryst between conflicted lovers, with synths bouncing around a simple drumbeat and a piano providing some languid drama. But there's no build, no direction. Even when he breaks the fourth wall on the last verse and speaks directly to the listener, the music doesn't react. Instead, it merely maintains, minding its own business and almost pointedly ignoring his lyrical gambit. If that song sets a melancholy tone for <i>Us Alone</i>, it also hints at its shortcomings. Too often the music just hangs there, possibly by design or more likely because Hayden is a limited instrumentalist (his drumming in particular is fairly rudimentary). As a result, these songs are heavy on atmosphere but low on dynamics, which completely deflates the meandering closer ""Instructions"". </p>
<p>About that last verse on ""Motel"": Perhaps Hayden intends that aside to the audience to be self-deprecating. ""I can't go on pretending this song is about young lovers, born to run,"" he sings, ""when it's clearly about you and me."" Especially with that shoehorned shout-out to the Boss, it comes across as self-satisfied, almost smug in its cleverness-- a wink rather than a tear. Hayden treads a fine line here, writing explicitly as a musician managing romantic disappointments, but more often than not it gets away from him: ""I don't want the bright lights, I don’t need more invites,"" he muses on ""Old Dreams"". ""I don't need more reviews, not unless they're from you.""</p>
<p>On the other hand, ""Almost Everything"", even with its nod to the title of his debut, is a clear-eyed origin story that recalls 1994 in all its promise: touring in a red Toyota Tercel, playing to crowds of seated fans, meeting a few of his heroes, allowing himself to believe he belongs in that world. It's a bittersweet reminiscence made all the more affecting by the mere fact that Hayden is still around to remember those days: ""I'll admit that now and then, some nights when I'm strumming, or maybe just strumming, music's still everything.""

Sometimes you get the impression that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29453-xxxy/"" target=""_blank"">xxxy</a>, nee Rupert Taylor, wants to turn back time, but to when is one of the riddles his music poses. Over a steady stream of singles and EPs, he's mingled Chicago house, UK garage, and bass music, usually in craftier ways than his jackin' peers. His appropriations of UKG-- a sound that borrowed heavily from 1990s R&amp;B-- feels prescient in the wake of groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"" target=""_blank"">Disclosure</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30260-alunageorge/"" target=""_blank"">AlunaGeorge</a>.</p>
<p>On <i>Got Me So</i>, Taylor's new three-song EP on Rinse, his sound has hardened into a neon plastic, machine-smooth composition. As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16521-everything-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Larry Fitzmaurice noted last year</a>, Taylor's expert at sounding both old and new, a balance he maintains here. The details of <i>Got Me So</i>'s tracks-- tinkling Rhodes stabs, boogie bass, wailing divas-- are vintage, but the execution is punchy and modern. Like the <i>Everything</i> EP before it, <i>Got Me So</i> foregrounds looped vocal refrains, their fidelity and brightness moving the tracks away from the gritty Chicago sound favored by much of the UK and into the spit-shined 90s varieties pioneered by MK or the Cajual label.</p>
<p>Instead of lacing these tracks with standard four-on-the-floor beats, Taylor employs the pitched, swung rhythms of 2-step, allowing the offbeat snares and hi-hats to tickle the fleshy arrangements. It is, admittedly, a subtle tweak, and it's here that Taylor's tidiness and craft hurts him, because someone not listening for or interested in these variations could easily mistake ""Got Me So"" or ""Get Ready"" as generic, modern takes on house music. Taylor is a connoisseur, prone to the type of twists best experienced in context. So while I'm sure that the title track here will blow few minds on first listen, I'm equally certain that its beautiful, foxtrotting bassline will end up in dozens of DJ sets and podcasts this year, and that it will sound great there.</p>
<p><i>Got Me So</i> is another solid release from Taylor, an artist who seems to have embraced his role as the quiet guy to the side who is one half-step ahead of his peers. He's not as dodgy or artful as celebrated artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28029-joy-orbison/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Orbison</a> and Boddika, but he continues to pace producers like Benjamin Damage and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30090-george-fitzgerald/"" target=""_blank"">George Fitzgerald</a>, whose visions of nu-school house aren't as vivid. Taylor's hardly a progressive, but he's a deft, patient producer whose tracks never bog down in craft.</p></div>"|17615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17615-got-me-so-ep/|6.7|Andrew Gaerig

Left in a room with other kids, he would go quiet, and for this, the story goes, his mother called him ""her frightened rabbit."" Years later, less shy, he began to write songs and sing them live, then along the way he added friends to the act-- two guitarists, a bassist, his brother on the drums-- and with them made albums on which he howled and drank and fucked and fought, every chord seeming to push the memory of his skittish namesake further and further away.</p>
<p>Yet the shy little boy remains. If a single thread can be spun from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5046-frightened-rabbit/"" target=""_blank"">Frightened Rabbit</a>'s first three albums, it's Hutchison's chronic tendency toward escape: into and out of relationships and the past, down through the bottom of uncountable whiskey glasses. ""Let's call me a Baptist, call this a drowning of the past/ She's there at the shoreline, throwing stones at my back,"" he sang on ""Swim Until You Can't See Land"", an easy favorite from 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13983-the-winter-of-mixed-drinks/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Winter of Mixed Drinks,</i></a> the band jangling along behind as he disappears into the sea-- in search of rebirth, perhaps, or at least a change of scenery.</p>
<p>But <i>Pedestrian Verse</i>, Frightened Rabbit's fourth album, finds Hutchison and his crew in different waters. Opening track ""Acts of Man"" immediately disarms. ""I'm that dickhead in the kitchen, giving wine to your best girl's glass,"" Hutchison breathes in a nasal falsetto over a gentle piano; the song seems poised to continue as some porcelain lament, but then begins its slow zoom out, from the kitchen to the street to the bar down the way, the percolating guitar and heartbeat drums rolling out as Hutchison notes the bar fights, the date rapes, the coward's festering pride. ""Man, he breeds although he shouldn't/ Breeding just because he comes/ Acts the father for a minute/ Until the worst instincts return,"" he seethes. ""I am just like all the rest of them,"" Hutchison sings, and he offers no apology, begs no forgiveness, slings no blame. This is a considerable step forward for the dude who once sang of a mangled breakup, ""My clothes won't let me close the door/ 'Cause my trousers seem to love your floor.""</p>
<p>Some sort of heartbreak skulks in the background here, too, though it's balanced with hints towards a similar split with religion. In ""Late March, Death March"", Hutchison is on the outs with both God and a girl; it's clear he's already given up on one, and the other's not faring much better. Assuming personal responsibility isn't exactly the stuff rock 'n roll fantasies are made of, but it sure as hell makes for better living-- and, in the right hands, better songs. As a lyricist, Hutchison's strength is increasingly proving to be lucid assessments of social and emotional turmoil; he can't push away the darkness completely, but he can feel around in every nook and cranny to get a full topography of the shadows.</p>
<p>More readily apparent than this new emotional maturity is how Frightened Rabbit has really shined up as a band. Earlier records had a certain cozy, shambolic feel: acoustic and electric guitars pushed along by dusty organ moans and piano lines that sounded plunked out in a dimly-lit barroom. It was charming, and occasionally bracing, but by 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17097-state-hospital-ep/"" target=""_parent""><i>State Hospital</i></a> EP, the band's second release for Atlantic, they seemed bored by it all. Here, producer Leo Abrahams, a longtime <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a> collaborator, has come in and jumpstarted things. The quietly fierce drumwork of Grant Hutchison now forms the backbone around which guitars needle and prod; unexpected textures are layered deep into the tracks, with horns and string swells rippling against gauzy curtains of distortion. The chorus dynamics err on the side of restraint, avoiding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Arcade Fire</a>'s apocalyptic urgency or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28595-mumford-sons/"" target=""_blank"">Mumford and Sons</a>' tweedy bombast. As always, Hutchison's rhotic howl is a pleasure all its own, but here he especially seems to knead and pull at his vowels.</p>
<p>The precise ecstasy of the production buoys the record through its few sluggish patches. There are the kernels of at least three great songs buried in the wonky diptych of ""Housing (In)"" and ""Housing (Out)"", and ""Nitrous Gas"" loses some lovely moments amidst a muddly anaesthetic metaphor; Hutchison's songwriting is best at its most emotionally specific. Frightened Rabbit isn't a perfect band-- and nobody knows this better than the lead singer. Of all the harsh truths he reminds himself of in <i>Pedestrian Verse</i>, the most endearing comes on the closing track, ""Oil Slick"", where he retraces his steps back to <i>The Winter of Mixed Drinks</i> just to gawk at his own maudlin tendencies. ""Took to the ocean, in a boat this time,"" he sings over a rubbery electric guitar lope, a little smile in his voice. ""Only an idiot would swim through the shit I write.""</p></div>"|17574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17574-pedestrian-verse/|7.6|Rachael Maddux

But then Ferry seemed born to both reinterpret and to look backwards. His solo career started one year after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"" target=""_blank"">Roxy Music</a>'s own debut full length with <i>These Foolish Things</i>, a collection of soul, jazz, and rock'n'roll standards often revisited in utterly surprising ways. By the time of his third solo album <i>Let's Stick Together</i>, Ferry combined yet more covers with reworkings of Roxy's own material just a few years after it had been written and recorded-- his preference for focused contemplation and his particularly male vision of love, lust, and wariness came to the fore.</p>
<p>All told, he's done six albums of covers and revisions over 40 years' time.<i> The Jazz Age</i> is the seventh out of 14 solo efforts total, though Ferry acts as co-producer and general driving force rather than performer. In fact, for the first time since <i>Let's Stick Together</i>, Ferry's own material is the subject of reworking: all selections are his work ranging from Roxy's debut single ""Virginia Plain"" to ""Reason or Rhyme"", a song from Ferry's previous solo album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14782-olympia/"" target=""_blank""><i>Olympia</i></a>. To a degree, <i>The Jazz Age</i>'s roots lie in 1999's <i>As Time Goes By</i>, where Ferry recorded jazz and pop songs predominantly from the 1930s. Five out of <i>The Jazz Age</i>'s eight performers reappear from the earlier work along with others such as regular Ferry collaborator, trumpeter Enrico Tomasso. But <i>The Jazz Age</i>, a collection of instrumentals performed by the Bryan Ferry Orchestra, is more self-consciously 1920s, openly meant to evoke Louis Armstrong, early Count Basie, and the initial mass popularization of jazz.</p>
<p>If there's an inescapable element of perverseness about <i>The Jazz Age</i>, it's the sense of flattening a life's work into pastiche, down to the fact that the album is mixed and produced in non-hi-fi mono, something definitely not the case on <i>As Time Goes By</i>. It doesn't matter whether the source material is a frenetic explosion like ""Do the Strand"", a clipped mood piece like ""Love is the Drug"" or ""Don't Stop the Dance"", or contemplative songs like ""Avalon"". The resultant energetic but never too disruptive presentation turns everything into something which sounds like it could be coming out of the Victrola at a party at ""Downton Abbey"" by the time the show hits season five. The album is hard to immediately see as anything but a studied curio by a famous name deliberately out of sync with nearly everything around it, unless one wants to talk about Hugh Laurie's tribute to New Orleans and the blues.</p>
<p>The internal trick of <i>The Jazz Age</i> is that Ferry's orchestra also deftly avoids simply sounding one-note despite the uniform presentation and ambience. At points the arrangements are almost specific responses to the originals. ""The Bogus Man"" here shrinks from 10 to two minutes long, hinting at second line comedy before the funeral's actually been completed, while ""I Thought"", a slow, stately number from 2002's <i>Frantic</i>, and his utterly poised 1985 hit ""Slave to Love"" both become peppy dance numbers. But whatever prompted the various reinterpretations, surprises turn up one by one, almost always enjoyably so. ""Avalon” kicks off with a rhythmic strut that's far more New Orleans than Newcastle, the crystalline theatricality of ""Reason or Rhyme"" mutates into a one-room-over and slightly boozy speakeasy swing, and ""Virginia Plain""'s dramatic pauses showcase notably friendlier sounding solos.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a telling break from Ferry's other work lies in the total absence of his most famous calling card-- his voice, with it his lyrical concerns and image. If anyone is the lead ""voice"" throughout it would be Tomasso or saxophonists Alan Barnes and Richard White, whose various solo turns on a number of songs take the place of the singing. As a result, it becomes a strangely affecting blend-- Ferry is here almost by implication, a certain unavoidably melancholic sigh that emerges in hints in the arrangements, even at their merriest.</p>
<p>The end result is actually the most atypical Ferry album of them all. It's something that seemed-- only after it was announced-- obvious that he would do but never actually did. It's also something he may never do again. It may not be an extreme reworking of song forms or a sudden return to action, perhaps simply another chapter in the various indulgences he enjoys, but in numerous ways, <i>The Jazz Age</i> is Ferry's most radical work yet.</p></div>"|17383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17383-the-jazz-age/|7.4|Ned Raggett

The blend of pottymouthed humor and a Biz Markie-an performance is by no means subtle, but it can easily catch you off guard and end up making a bunch of people waiting for the G train wonder what your deal is.</p>
<p>Cakes' less-than-faithful tribute to Ocean's breakthrough single might just be a raunchy joke, but it's also not hard to hear it as a gay rapper laughing at the Very Serious Discussion about gay rappers in media over the past year, which some no doubt very well-meaning cultural critics have included Frank Ocean in despite the fact that he's not actually a rapper. In this interpretation Cakes seems to be asking why it should be such a big deal that a male rapper is rapping about wanting to have sex with other men. Then, as if to prove the implied point, he goes on to rap about fucking men for another six songs.</p>
<p><span>Granted, he was already doing a lot of that up to that point. Cakes is maybe the closest thing hip-hop has right now to a Lil Kim figure, a raunchy-ass bitch who absolutely owns being a raunchy-ass bitch, and has enough on-mic charisma to convince us that this is an admirable personality type. (Azealia Banks's lack of off-mic charm disqualifies her, and Nicki Minaj is busy constructing a lane all her own.) The first time we hear Cakes on <i>The Eulogy</i>, after a chunk of Donna Summer's version of ""MacArthur Park"" pitched up to resemble vintage Kanye chipmunk soul, it's when he says ""Pockets stay on swole, peep the motherfucking cash flow/ niggas pay my loans just to finger fuck my asshole."" Things stay pretty much at that level from there on out.</span></p>
<p>In fact Cakes almost only breaks from describing sex scenes in comically graphic detail (one memorable one taking place in a Honda Civic) to throw a fantastic amount of shade on his haters. Like Dosha Devastation from House of Ladosha, he's proving that hip-hop can function extremely well as a conduit for the type of highly stylized bad attitude that's been refined into an art in the drag and ballroom scenes-- on ""Break 'Em Off"", he proudly declares himself ""the most clinically insane cunt bitch up in the game.""</p>
<p>According to a new interview in <i>Paper</i>, the mixtape's title originally referred to Cakes' plan to end his musical career after this release, but he's since changed his mind. Which is great news, because in the short time since his shaky, beat-jacking debut EP <i>Easy Bake Oven</i> in late 2011 and <i>The Eulogy</i>'s recording, he developed into a seriously talented artist. His writing is so densely packed with jokes and references that it takes several listens just to get a start on catching them all, and he's become a remarkably confident rapper, cramming bars full of syllables like E-40 and making enough unpredictable lateral moves (and using enough pitch-shifted voices) to ease the pain of Missy Elliott's ongoing absence for a second or two.</p>
<p>Despite its bummer of a title, <i>The Eulogy</i> is actually a total blast. Cakes' taste in beats runs toward minimalist arrangements and maximum crunk, and the production (by a roster of talented but unknown producers) is a pleasurable blend Detroit techno, Miami bass, 90s club R&amp;B, and the weirdest sounds that rap radio currently has to offer.</p>
<p>At one point Cakes brags that he can, ""spit that shit that make a homophobe a hypocrite,"" and I don't doubt that he could. There's something very compelling not only about the way he raps, but also about aggressive strain of hedonism at <i>The Eulogy</i>'s heart, this idea that simply making pleasure seeking the center of your existence can be a statement, even an art, and if anyone thinks differently then fuck 'em.</p></div>"|17684.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17684-the-eulogy/|7.5|Miles Raymer

Jacco Gardner's home is called the Shadow Shoppe Studio, and there, he creates music that hearkens back to the studio wizards of the 1960s: Brian Wilson, Van Dyke Parks, Syd Barrett, Curt Boettcher, Love, and so on. There's no sense of industry, or really, the 21st century in Gardner's baroque pop, which has a fanciful, sometimes jaunty Lewis Carroll quality to it. Unsurprisingly, he <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/dec/06/new-band-jacco-gardner"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told <i>The Guardian</i></a> that he found inspiration in records ""where the songwriter or artist also took over the role of producer and could really start experimenting and work out everything they could think of themselves."" With his head stuck in classic albums and with very few collaborators, he spent a couple years creating the universe you hear on his debut solo album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/19-cabinet-of-curiosities/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cabinet of Curiosities</i></a>.</p>
<p>It's not just hard to hear a hint of the modern world in Gardner's music; it's hard to hear a hint of <i>Gardner</i> in Gardner's music. Though he's said in interviews that he wrote some of his songs from a personal place, his lyrics don't read like personal folk tales or journal fodder. Instead, they're littered with psychedelic romance and costume drama-- ""Open up the window to your mind/ So I can look inside and lend a hand,"" he sings in ""The One Eyed King"". ""Sleep when stars are bright,"" he coos in ""Lullaby"". The title track features harpsichords and laughing babies. Thematically speaking, <i>Cabinet of Curiosities</i> is all facade-- these are quaint stories approached with the tools of 1960s psychedelia. In order to pull off this sort of thing in 2013, it's on Gardner to create a soundscape strong enough to support his own airily fey material. And that's exactly what he does.</p>
<p>In the Shadow Shoppe, he created arrangements that are diverse and lush, where the most atmospheric elements on the record sound full instead of brittle. Opener ""Clear the Air"" can pull off harpsichords and featherlight synths because they're complemented by huge, echoing drums. In the chorus, beneath Gardner's vocal, you can hear voices lending haunting ""ahhs"" from each corner of the mix. And right when a song starts to get stale, he also knows exactly when to inject a bold new element. ""Summer's Game"" starts off pretty spare, but right when it begins to overstay its welcome around the midpoint, the percussive backbone kicks in and carries the song to the finish. It also helps that Gardner has an ear for melody-- his singsong sensibility makes the sweet, sad album closer ""The Ballad of Little Jane"" an easy highlight.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, Gardner plays it a bit too straight. ""Cabinet of Curiosities"", for example, is a repetitive instrumental that doesn't do much to add to its already well-established facade. And sometimes the ""Mad Hatter universe"" feeling turns more into ""oppressive carousel music,"" as is the case with ""The Riddle"". But the biggest danger for Gardner is in the album's diversity (or lack thereof). On an individual level, these songs can thrive due to their masterful arrangements. But it's hard to shake an overwhelming feeling of stagnation in the run from ""Watching the Moon"" to ""The Riddle"", which all feature the exact same sort of keyboard work.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, it's an album that's a bit on the long side, and for a record that has such firm roots in the 1960s, that's a tough obstacle to overcome. Overlong albums are one thing, but overlong <i>and </i>sonically derivative albums are usually near unlistenable. But it's the individual songs that make <i>Cabinet</i> worth the time. ""Puppets Dangling"" obviously has more of Gardner's whimsical imagery in its lyrics and title, but it also has some incredible moments. As he transitions into the song's refrain, he doesn't ramp up the percussion; he lets loose a barrage of gorgeous, densely packed strings and synths. It's a beautiful section of one song, and <i>Cabinet of Curiosities</i> has several just like it. The album might exist in the wrong era, but throughout, those moments highlight Gardner's biggest strength-- he's a studio wizard.</p></div>"|17715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17715-cabinet-of-curiosities/|7.2|Evan Minsker

Fred Armisen got on a stage in a field with a banjo, the band got ready, played a few hushed notes, and he sang ""I had a dream, of my grandfather and his wooden chair."" That was it. By the end of the sketch, a woman lightly blew on some feathers. She'd made the quietest music and had ""won"" the competition. The prize? Tickets to a race involving a pickup truck driving loudly through a dusty field. It was a funny moment, but it also illustrated something deeper: to make music that is obsessed with intimacy in our current world, you have to willfully disassociate yourself from the internet, from cities, and largely, from reality. </p>
<p>As Little Wings, Kyle Field has made a practice out of hiding out from the world while continuing to try and understand it. He's kicked around in M Ward's backing band, he played with Devendra Banhart for awhile. Mostly, he became known as a staple of the wide-eyed post Beat Happening K Records scene-- appearing on a few Microphones records while also collaborating with Calvin Johnson. What he shares with that scene is a reverent approach to nature and an appealingly amateur vocal style. You get the feeling that he'd prefer to walk around in the moss with no shoes on than check his email.</p>
<p>Musically, he isn't going so much for innovation as he is for a constant exploration of themes across an entire discography: loneliness, growing older, singing about his own music as a means of self-discovery in an infinite feedback loop that creates an entire world. Because of that, it's difficult to know where to start with the Little Wings catalog. It's all generally good, with moments of greatness peppered throughout.</p>
<p>There's a sepia flatness to the songs on <i>LAST</i>. Heavy moments are portrayed at exactly the same tempo and lyrical level. Field might be singing about death, life, or sitting around his house, but it's all going to touch on the same idea that the quietest moments are also the most transcendent ones...you just have to notice they exist. At his best, Field positions himself as an observer of nature and of himself. When he sings ""there goes my light feeling,"" on ""Light Feeling"" his voice cracks and strains against his own constraints. He doesn't sound sad to lose happiness, instead he sings from outside himself, like it's maybe a bummer worth noting later. It's a neat effect, but can become exhausting over the course of an album. You want him to experience some sort of catharsis-- and maybe he is, but if that's the case, we're only feeling it with him about half the time.  </p>
<p>Not too long ago, British author Zadie Smith spoke at the New York Public Library. As an aside, she half-joked that if a book involves a character staring out an ocean, it's probably not very good. Her point being that everyone is in awe of an ocean and everyone is in awe of nature, so staring out at a vast expanse of water and not being able to see a horizon is now emotional shorthand for poignancy. Maybe it's worth finding other ways to be deep. There are, of course, always exceptions to this rule. Field is able to transform the mundane into a quietly shared experience-- it works as a sort of Introspective Depressives Anonymous. His songs are for people fiending for the next transcendent moment to jumpstart their lives. He knows these moments can exist, but is never sure where he'll next find them. On ""Wide Daylight"" he wonders if he can ""manage to turn the corner again."" The implication being that the song itself could be that corner for at least a few listeners somewhere.</p>
<p>By the time ""You Know Who"" starts, it feels like a turning point. A break from Field's shaky-voiced uncertainty comes in the form of murky keys that give way to an unexpectedly strong moment, when Field sings ""barely old enough to fade now, and young enough to be strong,"" he's illustrating a particular kind of purgatory-- the space between full blown responsible adulthood and the last remnants of youthful brashness. With over a decade's worth of music under his belt, he seems content to stay there forever.</p></div>"|17677.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17677-last/|6.9|Sam Hockley-Smith

""Definitely sometime this year or I'm dead..."" he answered, later driving the point home with, ""I really am dead if I don't get my record out this year. Nobody's threatening me, BTW I just have to.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">That chat took place exactly 16 years ago tomorrow and Kevin Shields is still alive. And now, almost 22 years after My Bloody Valentine's last album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16605-isnt-anything-reissue-loveless-reissue-eps-1988-1991/"" target=""_blank""><i>Loveless</i></a>, we finally have that record. For those of us whose relationship to music and maybe even the act of hearing has been changed by <i>Loveless</i>, it's hard to believe. I'd grown comfortable with the idea that there would never be another My Bloody Valentine album. Even as recently as two months ago, I figured it would never happen. ""But he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48508-my-bloody-valentine-finish-mastering-new-album/"">said it was mastered</a>,"" people said to me. The last time a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16605-isnt-anything-reissue-loveless-reissue-eps-1988-1991/"">master of an MBV album</a> was completed it took four years for it to come out. And that was music that had already been released. An alleged master of a <i>new</i> release? Plenty of time to pull the plug. But no, it happened, by surprise, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49344-my-bloody-valentine-share-new-album-mbv-site-crashes-check-out-cover-art-and-tracklist-now/"" target=""_blank"">last Saturday night</a>. And many 403 errors later, we finally have this thing on our hard drives. <i>mbv</i>. 2013. This Is Our Bloody Valentine. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9055-mbv/"">a few people</a> I know, I was initially afraid to listen, but there was no need to be. My Bloody Valentine have taken the precise toolkit of <i>Loveless</i>-- layered Fender Jaguar guitars made woozy through pedals and tremolo, hushed androgynous vocals way down in the mix-- and made another album with it, one that is stranger and darker and even harder to pin down. Where <i>Loveless</i> felt effortless, <i>mbv</i> strains, pushing at its boundaries with a sense of pensive gloom. If the guy spending all those years in the studio felt trapped by the experience, like the walls might be closing in and that he was dead if he didn't finish, the music here reflects it. <i>mbv</i> is an album of density with very little air or light. But it doesn't forgo the human touches that have made this band so special.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The nine-song <i>mbv</i> can be divided into thirds and the first three-song section, consisting of ""She Found Now"", ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14876-only-tomorrow/"" target=""_blank"">Only Tomorrow</a>"", and ""Who Sees You"", finds Shields exploring the untapped textural possibilities of the guitar. The last several years have been bad ones for the instrument. In independent music circles, the guitar has become synonymous with regression, a symbol used to evoke something from the past. And that might seem at first equally true here, since the tone of Shields' guitar is so clearly connected to the sounds he pioneered two decades ago. But no one believes more deeply than Kevin Shields in the expressive power of the processed guitar, and the music here turns out to be more about feeling than style. </p>
<p class=""p1"">""She Found Now"" is an opener of daring subtlety, a ballad in the vein of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0dJqlvOSq4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sometimes</a>"" that consists mostly of deep strumming and Shields' singing in a tone near a whisper. There's a bit of percussion, a few more layers of distortion, but no announcement of anything earth-shattering or even particularly different. It's My Bloody Valentine making the kind of noises they invented and perfected. As the chords cycle through in the following ""Only Tomorrow"", Shields sets up a situation where the repetition and familiarity lulls you into a kind of trance and small gestures hit with great force. On ""Only Tomorrow"" that spine-tingling moment is a dead simple screeching high-end refrain that repeats toward the end, while on the following ""Who Sees You"", it's a section halfway through where a rush of trebly chords coats the entire song in another layer of textured fuzz. When it comes to Shields and guitars, the small details do a tremendous amount of work. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The second trio of songs feature the lead vocals of My Bloody Valentine singer/guitarist Bilinda Butcher. The push and pull of her singing next to Shields' is, along with the wavy ""glide guitar"" effect, My Bloody Valentine's other defining characteristic. Their voices are the essence of the the band's strangely androgynous and non-specific sensuality. ""Is This and Yes"" is just Butcher's voice and an unusual organ pattern that hangs in space at the end of the progression and never resolves itself; ""New You"" is the only track on the record that sounds even remotely like a single, and it shows that Shields' melodic impulses have not left him.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">In another sense, ""New You"" points out how much has changed since MBV last released a full-length. In 1991, they were still a pop band, the kind that made videos and appeared on magazine covers and were on a fashionable <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">record label</a>. As such, there was at least some pressure for them to fit in, for their music to have context in the popular music landscape. So they released singles and probably hoped they'd become hits. Even if ""Soon"" had, as Brian Eno <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/my-bloody-valentine-the-sound-of-the-future-19920206"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stated at the time</a>, set a ""new standard,"" that didn't change that fact that it was in fact still pop. But those days are gone. My Bloody Valentine fit in exactly nowhere and the commercial expectations of a release like <i>mbv</i> are minimal. Whatever the cause, <i>mbv</i> is the weirdest album My Bloody Valentine have made by some margin. Some of the record's otherworldly quality is up to frequency range. There's very little on this album in the treble range but there's endless detail in the bass and mid, which makes the record feel more closed in and insular. But some of it is in the arc of the record. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Through the 1990s Kevin Shields often talked about jungle, what it meant to him, and how some of the ideas behind it were making their way into a new My Bloody Valentine album. He was not alone in this, but mixing drum'n'bass' whooshing walls of percussion with oceanic shoegaze seemed a natural pairing (it was so natural, in fact, that artists like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90rIyiuQ5B0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Third Eye Foundation</a> beat Shields to the punch). Whether or not the final three songs on <i>mbv</i> are related to Shields' experiments of that time, on <i>mbv</i>, where Shields presumably had time to make the drum parts he wanted, it's clear that he doesn't really hear percussion the way most of us do. Drums are mostly distant, often muddy, serving as an underpinning or textural contrast to the guitar instead of driving the rhythm on their own. In this sense they mirror the 8-bit snatches of sound caught by crude samplers in the 90s. But since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16605-isnt-anything-reissue-loveless-reissue-eps-1988-1991/"" target=""_blank""><i>Isn't Anything</i></a>, drums have been down on the list of concerns for MBV, which is one way the final third is so surprising and ultimately powerful. </p>
<p class=""p1"">""In Another Way"", another Butcher lead, begins to tilt the balance between noise and melodic beauty as the tempo increases, and by the following instrumental ""Nothing Is"" the mood has changed considerably. A track of heavy bass drums and pounding guitar, it feels militaristic and even a touch grim, with just faint glimmers of beauty inside the barrage. And then by the final ""Wonder 2"" the album has become something else. This is MBV's version of an album-closing ""L.A. Blues""-like Stooges freak-out, where they stop worrying about structure and fill every inch of tape with noise. The heavy flanging evokes choppers buzzing overhead, and somehow, through it all, there are wispy voices, buried and being shoved around by the din. It's a disquieting end. Where <i>Loveless</i>, despite its complexity, sounded as natural as breathing, <i>mbv</i> sounds like the product of great effort, of meticulous work to get every sound in place. And that exertion is especially apparent in the final third, as Shields tries and ultimately succeeds in taking the project somewhere it's never gone. All this work gives <i>mbv</i> its own quality, simultaneously intimate and detached. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Like its predecessor, <i>mbv</i> feels like an album in part about love, but it approaches the grandest of human emotions from an unusual angle. Kurt Cobain, another iconic songwriter of the 1990s who never got a chance to grow old and figure out how to maintain his creativity in the wake of game-changing masterpieces, had a song called ""Aneurysm"" and it had a refrain that went, ""Love you so much, makes me sick."" That's how My Bloody Valentine's deeply destabilizing queasiness, amplified here to a frightening degree, has always struck me: There's a rush of feeling inside their music so intense it creates a kind of paralysis. Music swirls and moves in and out of phase, voices float by, half memory and half anticipation, and you're never quite sure how all the parts fit together. You get lost in it, and if you're wired a certain way that mixture of desire and confusion is easy to map on to the wider world. For 22 years, the only way to get there was through <i>Loveless</i> and its associated EPs; now there's another path, one many of us never expected to find. That it's this successful in spite of it all is something we never had a right to expect.</p></div>"|17726.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17726-mbv/|9.1|Mark Richardson

Since then, they've released everything from freak folk to instrumental hip-hop to free-jazz and psychedelic funk. The pair recently partnered with Stones Throw to release the <i>Dual Form</i> compilation, a set of 19 new tracks that highlights that eclectic Leaving Records vision and also serves as an announcement of an ongoing distribution agreement between the two labels.</p>
<p>While the collection is the perfect primer for Matthewdavid's and Moretti's taste, it's almost impossible to pin down what that taste reveals about the two artists, one of whom is already on a shortlist of the strangest musicians currently working. The Leaving Records vision forms a large umbrella, and most of the music the label releases is abstruse, and difficult to classify.  But the tracks on <i>Dual Form</i> do tend to have some comfortable points of comparison to help listeners get their bearings. </p>
<p>For one thing, most of them contain a loose thread of focus, a core which is surrounded by distracting noise. That noise comes in the form of loose dialogue, in arrhythmic interruptions, anything that your yoga teacher might refer to as ""the distractions of your day."" ""Windy Windy"" by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1121-dntel/"" target=""_blank"">Dntel</a> (aka Jimmy Tamborello, of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"" target=""_blank"">the Postal Service</a>), is a perfect example. The track builds off a pleasant little loop, and then totally submerges that loop in a waterfall of ambient noise, before the pattern finally emerges unscathed at the end of the song. Even the most straightforward song on the collection, a kind of gateway drug in the form of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"" target=""_blank"">Julia Holter</a> covering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"" target=""_blank"">Arthur Russell</a>, has snippets of dialogue floating through the performance, as if it were a bootleg recording that turned up in somebody's basement, a long-forgotten remnant of some LA newbie's obsessive recording of his first week in the city of angels. </p>
<p>Most of the songs are unsettled, surreal, and distorted, never ugly but never particularly easy to get a solid grasp on, especially given how quickly they flow into one another. Pleasant, off-kilter bass from Liverpool producer the Cyclist on ""Visions"" melts into loose verses from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29808-serengeti/"" target=""_blank"">Serengeti</a> whose abstract, hollowed out voice makes perfect sense for a loopy beat from Matthewdavid himself (the duo are identified as Davis, the name of an EP they released together in 2011). From there, we tumble into the minute-long ""Lion's Dream"", another simple loop, this one dwarfed by domino shuffles and replete with rattles and fuzz. Thankfully, there's an internal logic governing these transitions that helps to cushion the shock of diving into a new sound experiment every couple of minutes.</p>
<p>When interviewed Matthewdavid, born Matthew McQueen, tends to couch his preference for offbeat music in spiritual terms. And while sneerers are going to sneer, it's impossible to deny that there is some spirituality to <i>Dual Form</i>. That's partly because the collection jolts you out of everyday listening patterns so effectively; expectations are useless in the midst of an album full of left turns, and the experience puts the willing listener in the most open mindset possible. And it's partly due to the unique beauty of the collection. Anticon co-founder Odd Nodsam's contribution, the stunning ""Sisters"", is all gleaming tones and angelic voices. And ""Peace"", from Muscovite producer Lapti, is aptly named with exceptionally pretty rainbow chords and a friendly shuffling pace.   </p>
<p>That open mindset we talked about is necessary for the most outré tracks here. ""Labelle Gross"", provided by the field recording hip-hop instrumentalist Oscar McClure is as disjointed as you might expect those two genres to be when combined and nearly impossible to get your head around. Some of the interruptions on Dem Hunger's ""Glue Suit"" are unpleasantly jarring, similar to the static expulsions on Lou Reed's ""Kicks"" without that calming heroin croon. But in contrast there's a straightforwardness to contributions from Philly beatmaker Knx (formerly Knxledge, whom Dilla heads should be familiar with) and Belgian loopmaster Ssaliva, who somehow manages to effectively deploy bird calls in the midst of an electronic mélange. Perhaps the most enjoyably simple track of all is ""Cooked Love, Lady Bomb"", a slice of sun-ripened funk from the one-man Floridian band, Dream Love.</p>
<p>So what <i>can</i> we tell about Matthewdavid and Moretti from this collection? They are definitely outsiders and they favor their fellows. They are likely both inheritors of the ""freak"" mantle that Hunter S. Thompson assigned to himself and his ilk. And they are probably two of the most open-minded artists you’re going to hear from. <i>Dual Form</i>, might be just too plain weird for many listeners. But for others it should be a worthy exploration, a journey into the curatorial whims of two artists whose tastes, as obscure as they might be, have an undeniable, if indefinable, cohesion.</p></div>"|17649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17649-dual-form/|7.0|Jonah Bromwich

And yet, what do we have to show for the past three decades of trying to find common ground between the barroom and the bedsit? Ryan Adams' <i>Love Is Hell</i>? Pernice Brothers? Hell, don't sleep on a couple joints from the first Pete Yorn album. But is that gonna cut it? Whether you think it's more promising from an artistic or a commercial standpoint, Night Beds' <i>Country Sleep </i>shows you just how wide open this lane really is. Upon first listen, you're struck with the thought of ""Wow, this could be <i>really </i>popular."" Because for a lot of people, nothing cuts through the noise like a 23-year old singer-songwriter who wants to tell you over either acoustic guitars or weepy, reverbed ones how he drank, loved and lost beyond his years. Winston Yellen, essentially the creative body of Night Beds, does both. And in a lot of ways, <i>Country Sleep </i>delivers while still making you feel like it's playing on your vulnerability, the Pavlovian response to this stuff: It wants you to feel your own pain as much as it allows you to feel Yellen's.</p>
<p>That said, Yellen is kind of the real deal. His past couple of years have been itinerant, dropping out college, having been relieved of both jobs and girlfriends, traveling across the country and eventually writing <i>Country Sleep </i>in a Nashville house once owned by none other than Johnny Cash himself. Dude had to take out some loans to get it done, but I swear, labels should be giving out scholarships for this sort of thing if you've got a voice like Yellen's. The guy is blessed with jump-out-of-the-gym vocal athleticism and throughout <i>Country Sleep</i>, it's unclear whether he's a showoff or if he's still trying to figure out how to corral it. Though there’s a fair share of C&amp;W formalism and cask-aged drawl, Yellen's more of a Buckley or even a Banhart in terms of his ability to work without strcuture. A diva, in other words. That much is clear from a cappella opener ""Faithful Heights"", which ascends from a maudlin moan to a holler by its end. On the opposite side, there's ""Even If We Try"", audio lemon meringue that's little more than a couple of fluffy chords and Yellen's tart falsetto in waltz time before shifting to a fiddle-led reverie. </p>
<p>It's all very disarming and <i>Country Sleep </i>talks a good game and looks the part like the beautiful, new stranger in town. And it all comes down to whether or not you want to ask it the tough questions. ""Ramona"" is an instantly ingratiating piece of twang-free alt-country, rollicking acoustic strums, gliding lead riffs on guitar rather than pedal steel and a good ol' ""fuck"" thrown in to seal the alt- deal. But as you listen to him describe this girl, stunted by religion and a vague social anxiety, flawed in all the right ways and salvageable through Yellen, you start to get Manti Te'o on the brain and wonder, has he actually <i>met </i>someone like Ramona? Or is she just a construct that makes for a narrative that's easy to grasp? In fact, is the guy singing this song real? I dunno, but judging from that billowy coda, she sure is pretty.</p>
<p>So yeah, even if it's steeped in genres whose appeal often rests on the authenticity of one's sadness, it's beautiful enough for you to feel guilty about refusing to totally suspend your disbelief. The guy might strive to present himself as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/36-heartbreaker/"" target=""_blank""><i>Heartbreaker</i></a>, but he's much better playing the softie. While ""Lost Springs"" and ""Was I For You?"" are certainly breakup balm, it's the over-the-counter stuff. He repeats ""I don't wanna feel this,"" towards the end of the former, though my guess is that you actually <i>do </i>want to feel <i>this.</i> It's a kind of lovesickness that feels manageable, even somewhat attractive. And hell, you're probably <i>already </i>inspired to make your next crush playlist, which will include tracks from <i>Country Sleep</i>. A propulsive, be-quiet-and-drive song at its core, the hushed ""22"" drops the top to let in the sound of crickets and sparkling strings. Likewise, after an untethered falsetto introduces ""Wanted You In August"", everything stops for Yellen to intone ""I want you"" and the stars go blue, evoking the humidity and romantic allure of southern, summer nights-- the double meaning of the word ""pine"" practically invented Yellen's lyrical style.</p>
<p>But while he plays the part of a guy born into an abundance of inherited sadness, how much of it is his own? It's a question that keeps arising from a musical and a lyrical standpoint. Point blank, if you locked Ryan Adams in a room for an hour with an acoustic guitar and demanded he write five songs, one of them would probably be 97% like ""Cherry Blossoms"". The five-minute closer ""TENN"" suggests it's the most autobiographical song on <i>Country Sleep, </i>but it's one where you need to retrofit his bio so that its epigram-- ""sorrow stole my youth/ what's left I'll give to you""-- hits the way it should. For the time being, Yellen nails letting the sound and emotional tenor of <i>Country Sleep </i>give us the gist: we were supposed to rise above, but we sink into the ocean, he's waiting to derail, he loves the feeling when he goes out, dancing with the women at the bar. Yellen might not have too much to say about his Nashville city nights that we haven't heard before, but <i>Country Sleep </i>works as a personal work about the shared experience of…how'd that song go? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_TgoMm4q3E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You were young and man, you were sad</a>. </p></div>"|17656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17656-country-sleep/|7.7|Ian Cohen

Sunken and downcast, Menzies uses his voice to add a measure of introspection to his pattering, tricky machine music. <i>Wraetlic</i> (Anglo Saxon for ""wraith-like"") finds Smoke on Convex Industries, a young label that last year saw its proprietor, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30553-jon-convex/"" target=""_blank"">Jon Convex</a>, release <i>Idoru</i>, an electro album that shares much with Smoke's work. On <i>Wraetlic</i>, Menzies dispenses with any notion of body music in favor of stirring, sour tracks that, somewhat awkwardly, function as songs.</p>
<p>Menzies' last album, <i>Lux</i>, employed the producer's voice as well, but it did so in an abstract manner, peppering tracks indebted to Warp Records' 1990s output. <i>Wraetlic</i> places Menzies' altered voice in the foreground, circling garbled phrases and lingering around melodies. Digitally processed until it slurs and curdles, the voice hovers above the album's minor-key ripples, inescapable and constant. It is the album's binding force. Imagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a>'s Karin Dreijer Andersson, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke/"" target=""_blank"">Thom Yorke</a>'s most abstract moments, but less dramatic than either. The slurry of effects settles over Menzies' busy compositions, an intriguing blend of precision and obscurity. The effect masks many of Menzies' specific utterances, but the album's tenor-- which steers between surly and mopey-- provides enough clues.</p>
<p>When his syllables blend just so, Menzies is capable of a modern, attractive fatigue: the whirring current of ""PintleGrist"", for instance, sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a> processed through a ring modulator. Perhaps it is more than mere fatigue. Menzies admitted, via email, that some of the songs were born out of a breakup and the passing of friends. Menzies' voice is an instrument, except when it's not.</p>
<p>More often, this effect is wearying. For an album preoccupied with dissatisfaction and sadness, one that cloaks its compositions in minor keys and the hard surfaces of techno and electro, <i>Wraetlic</i> isn't dissonant or discontent. There is plenty of implied pathos, and little fire: this is the sound of drum machines wallowing, of synths complaining. Smoke's unique vocal effect is partly to blame, making the songs seem slower and longer than they actually are.</p>
<p>Better pacing might have helped. In the album's back half, Menzies dials up a couple of legit bangers, fragments his cloudy vocals, and offers the miasma that pervades <i>Wraetlic</i> something to chafe against. There's friction and a sense of urgency. These bolder tracks also remind what a tidy, talented producer Menzies is. Give ""The Dearth"" and ""Rats"" a subwoofer and some room to breathe and <i>Wraetlic</i> accrues a hard-won vitality. (Remixes by Convex and dBridge scatter Menzies' voice, proving it an appealing sonic artifact.)</p>
<p><i>Wraetlic</i>'s headspace is a simple one to sink into. It's easy, fun even, to be obtusely bummed for <i>Wraetlic</i>'s 50-minute run. At its best, the album offers an outlet for this sadness and negativity; too often it merely reflects it. There's room for Smoke to grow into this new guise, but <i>Wraetlic</i> is too satisfied with its own dissatisfaction to serve as anything more than comfort food for those predisposed to melancholia.</p></div>"|17653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17653-wraetlic/|6.1|Andrew Gaerig

Even glo-fi OG <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Toro Y Moi</a>, who just released his fourth LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17516-anything-in-return/"" target=""_blank""><i>Anything In Return</i></a>, seems unable to resist the allure of beat-minded, laid back vibes, despite how grown-up his music sounds today. And it's with Chaz Bundick that we come to Renny Wilson, an Edmonton, Alberta, musician formerly known as Sugarglider, who has now released his pastel-colored debut titled after that discarded moniker. Chock full of gummy basslines, tony sax hooks, and spaced-out disco nods, <i>Sugarglider</i> feels like the soundtrack to a slideshow of some faded, pimply prom photos. So while the sounds Wilson clings to so dearly are mutating and cross-breeding into shapes nearly unrecognizable, he's happy to do as his forbearers did, and look to the past for inspiration. In other words, this <i>is</i> your father's chillwave.</p>
<p>You have to kind of hand it to Wilson, as the guy doesn't pull any punches. Aside from a very slight krautrock-y detour (the title track) and a few nods to proto-chillwave godhead <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a> (""Bound to Lose""), <i>Sugarglider</i> is one continuous, mirrorball-powered jam, as tracks bleed into one another with such ease, there's little distinction as to where one ends and the other begins. Almost everything here is fed on a foolproof diet of boogie-nutrient food groups, meant to shake hips slowly: The aforementioned smooth sax licks, nods to Chic and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Arthur Russell</a>, bleary synths, and delayed vocals, all tightly orbiting around careful but unctuous rhythms. In other words, it's the perfect soundtrack to your next key party or couples skate, despite the fact that you can practically see Wilson orchestrating the whole thing from his bedroom. There's more than just a whiff of irony in this music, but Wilson takes it seriously-- lyrically, he's frequently lost in love, forlorn and a little desperate, no matter how groove-laden the tunes may be.</p>
<p>But Wilson's music is very much about context it's being enjoyed in, which can often be a drawback. Like his LA-based backyard disco contemporaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30516-poolside/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Poolside</a>, you're probably not going to, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16865-pacific-standard-time/"" target=""_blank"">as Pitchfork's Jordan Sargent mentioned</a>, have much use for the record ""unless of course, you have plans to lie by the water for a few hours."" Or in the case of <i>Sugarglider</i>, play spin the bottle in someone's basement in 1980. This doesn't make it any less enjoyable, but it does shorten it's potential reach. A quick scan of <a href=""http://rennywilson.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wilson's Bandcamp page</a> will reveal a lengthy list of names that inspired <i>Sugarglider</i>, from Al Green to Gary Numan to ""The Fuckin' Beatles."" Had Wilson made good on incorporating some of these influences, and in turn varied his sound a bit more, he very well may have produced a more accommodating first effort.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Sugarglider</i>'s real trouble is how repetitive it sounds. Wilson's no doubt stumbled upon a formula that really works, yet it's accompanied by the nagging problem of how far he can stretch it. The record's best song, ""Who Was I?""-- its clanging bells anchored by a hypnotic, definable melodic hook-- is also only the second track on the album, and it's pretty much all you need to know about <i>Sugarglider</i> in a tidy three minutes and 30 seconds. The rest of the time is spent recycling the same ideas by occasionally tweaking the tempo (usually to lesser effect-- most of these songs work better the more movement-minded they are).</p>
<p>One of the biggest complaints about chillwave was how near-sighted it seemed: Too reliant on aesthetic, too one-note, too concerned with the past. Unfortunately, Wilson hasn't done much here to remedy that kind of thinking. At the same time, he's made a fairly enjoyable album, which in 2013 is more than you could expect from someone taking a hardline stance with the format. So while there isn't aything new going on here, it's safe to say that you can go ahead and keep those ""Boro Y Moi"" jokes in your pocket for a little while longer.</p></div>"|17703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17703-sugarglider/|6.2|Zach Kelly

Their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15539-unknown-mortal-orchestra/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">self-titled debut</a> was a wonderful record that lived up to the promise of early singles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12189-ffunny-ffrends/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">""Ffunny Ffriends""</a> and ""How Can U Luv Me"". And the more we got to know Ruban Nielson, the more compelling he became; an outspoken, opinionated frontman, and, even rarer in the indie rock realm, a truly badass guitar player as well. The overall picture ended up leaving more to the imagination than secrecy: How would UMO sound with a bigger production budget? Would Nielson devote more attention to his guitar heroism than his songwriting? While there's no need for those two qualities to be in conflict, <i>II</i> eschews the greatness within its grasp whenever it pits them against one another.  The result is a record that's equally remarkable and frustrating, split between incredible pop songs and turgid guitar noodling with very little middle ground.</div>
<p>Let's start with the good stuff, since that's what <i>II </i>does. Within the first four songs, Nielson reiterates what helped <i>Unknown Mortal Orchestra </i>transcend simple time-stamped pastiche: his handsomely scuffed vocals and inventive melodies, and a rhythmic vocabulary that draws equally and naturally from psych rock, hard funk, and soul. It's the work of an assured craftsman with a preferred set of sonic parameters, and shows off the band's development in a lucid, loose fashion. <i>UMO</i>'s lo-fi sizzle and compression gave it the feel of an artifact, a lost treasure transmitted through decades of overdubbed tapes. <i>II </i>isn't a big budget affair, and Nielson still handles everything except the drums. The result is a surprisingly minor but welcome upgrade in fidelity that makes <i>II</i> sound more lived-in than pre-damaged, like a worn pair of jeans or an unmade bed.</p>
<p>Such forlorn images are hardly coincidental considering the despondent lyrical bent early on in the record. ""From the Sun"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14253-swim-and-sleep-like-a-shark/"" target=""_blank"">""Swim and Sleep (Like A Shark)""</a> are compositionally challenging and rewarding, like they're trying to see just how many notes and chord changes can fit into a verse and still stick in your head. But they're given to the startling thoughts of a mind that's ditched the Deadhead vibes of his debut in favor of exploring all the colors of the <a href=""http://www.simpsoncrazy.com/episodes/barts-inner-child"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">feel bad rainbow</a>: ""Isolation can put a gun in your hand,"" Nielson sings on the former, and the latter's chorus serves a suicide metaphor that takes as many odd turns as its backing melody. Even the soulful simmer of ""So Good at Being in Trouble"" doesn't come off as bravado-- not when the attendant lyric is ""so bad at being in love."" </p>
<p>It's an impressive start that heralds a curious bit of sequencing; starting with ""The Opposite of Afternoon"", <i>II </i>places its three longest tracks consecutively in the middle, resulting in nearly 18 minutes that put the focus squarely on Nielson's guitar playing. His skills aren't necessarily self-evident since there's little in the way of pyrotechnics; they're the kind that are more impressive when you can see his hands move and witness how he fits interesting chord inversions, walking riffs, and quick vamps into a pop structure. Without the visual element, there's little to latch onto, and while the nifty riffs of ""...Opposite"" are attention-grabbing, they constitute the last hook we hear for some time. ""No Need for a Leader"" goes for a brisk, head-down six-minute jog, which at least is preparation for ""Monki"", whose seven minutes pass with hardly a memorable moment. You could take the droning instrumental of the subsequent ""Dawn"" as an audio metaphor; the momentum of <i>II </i>has pretty much flatlined by that point.</p>
<p>It's a tough patch to endure, taking up nearly half of the record, and yet by the end it feels like the right call. <i>II</i> starts and<i> </i>finishes on strong notes, making it easy to revisit, and leaving the midsection as an isolated affair that might grow on you. If ""Monki"" and ""No Need for a Leader"" were distributed more evenly, <i>II </i>might come off more scattershot than it really is. In a way, the sequencing speaks to the curmudgeonly streak Nielson has <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8958-unknown-mortal-orchestra/"">shown</a>, and aligns with the record's themes of exhaustion and depression by channeling massive amounts of energy into relatively short bursts while being subjected to long expanses of aimlessness. Perhaps Nielson's own ambitions don't align with external expectations of how to follow a promising, lo-fi debut. When <i>II</i> is truly on, it's proof that great albums aren't the sole measure of a great band, a subtle advance that puts Unknown Mortal Orchestra right back where they started: something of a mystery, but one that will certainly be interesting going forward.</p></div>"|17570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17570-ii/|7.3|Ian Cohen

Londoner Darren Cunningham has been on an astounding run since his debut, 2008 LP <i>Hazyville</i>, but he's never been an easy artist. His abstracted techno tends to appear opaque, yet somehow retains its transparency by revealing layers upon layers of sound hidden in the crushed frequencies. You have to look for it at first, but even with his most difficult music,<i> </i>somehow you know there's genius lurking underneath. With the <i>Silver Cloud </i>EP, however, I wondered for the first time whether some of his magical, digital dust was missing.</p>
<p>Of course, I was wrong. Which I figured out after about 10 listens. But there is something that feels different about the <i>Silver Cloud</i> EP, his first new music since 2012's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16544-actress-rip/"" target=""_blank"">R.I.P.</a>.</i> That record had a strangely homemade and organic feel to it, like finger-painting with pixels. While <i>Silver Cloud </i>uses the same palette of rainy-day greyscale crackle, the three-track EP sees a return of sorts to beat-oriented material, following <i>R.I.P.</i>'s pastoral landscapes. It also marks a homecoming to Cunningham's own <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/WerkDiscs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Werk Discs</a> label, having spend time over at Honest Jon's.</p>
<p>The EP starts off with ""Voodoo Posse Chronic Illusion"", one of Actress' longest tracks to date. Its palette is plaintive, but the way it methodically, mindlessly repeats <i>forever </i>with little variation is almost aggressive-- like a particularly hostile staring contest. This dimension feels less friendly than usual, maybe even lazy. But lay on the lapping ebb and you'll be pulled into deep relaxation with every mangled guitar strum; it's lo-fi new age music. You'll hardly even notice the brittle percussion come in and nudge everything along so beautifully and fluidly.</p>
<p>The flipside is even stranger. Much of the talk surrounding the EP-- which was pressed as a sneaky white label before its proper digital release-- was flustered frustration about whether the vinyl rips floating around online were at the correct speed. It's easy to understand the confusion: these two tracks are syrupy slow, mining the same dungeon house territory as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/"" target=""_blank"">Andy Stott</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17205-luxury-problems/"" target=""_blank"">recent work</a>, all demonic vocal samples and engine room churn.</p>
<p>Both tracks are cut from the same cloth, but different in mission. ""Silver Cloud Dream Come True"" is illusory, industrial techno beat thin like malleable metal, marking each bar with a portentous chime. ""Floating in Ecstasy"", meanwhile, is unlike much else in the Cunningham catalog: It's drenched in tape hiss, and the synth noises have more in common with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4619-wolf-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Eyes</a> than anything else. Here he's taking a rare cue from someone else, the lo-fi house of collectives like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17507-lies-presents-american-noise/"" target=""_blank"">L.I.E.S.</a>. It's a move that already suits Cunningham's distinctly decayed, sawn-off palette. Like all three tracks on <i>Silver Cloud</i>, it's unusual and a little more impenetrable than usual. But like Cunningham's entire oeuvre, each track unwinds into a tapestry of intense sonic detail if you just give it a little time to recline.</p></div>"|17707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17707-silver-cloud-ep/|7.7|Andrew Ryce

It's not surprising that they're friendly with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29771-the-history-of-apple-pie/"">the History of Apple Pie</a>, a relentlessly perky London five-piece whose similar predilection for American indie oldies has also been painted as a nostalgia thing, though the blatant nature of their influences means the description suits them much better.</p>
<p><i>Out of View</i>, their debut full-length, follows a series of well received singles, and appropriates the signature fuzzed-out rock sound of indie rock's golden years in much the same way as bands such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast/"" target=""_blank"">Best Coast</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a> recontextualized 60s guitar pop: as a vehicle for yearning for what they perceive to be simpler times. Only those who didn't live through the years documented in <i>Our Band Could be Your Life</i> would mistake them for a sepia-tinged period of innocence and carefree romance, but that's exactly how they're re-imagined by the History of Apple Pie on <i>Out of View</i>: The rush of pretty, feedback-heavy guitar and singer Stephanie Minn's girlish Miki Berenyi impression makes music from a complicated time into malt-shop material. Supposedly inspired by a friend who memorized the script to <i>True Romance</i>, an emblem of 90s cool if there ever was one, ""You're So Cool"" runs the ""let's pretend we're married"" conceit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"" target=""_blank"">the Beach Boys</a>' ""Wouldn't it Be Nice"" through a shoegaze filter, for a dreamy effect that reinforces the song's wide-eyed fantasy of young love: ""I woke up and everything's alright,"" Minn sings. ""Remember the great day that we shared/ And the flower you gave me to put in my hair/ You're so sweet.""</p>
<p>As if the History of Apple Pie wasn't already setting itself up for mockery with that doozy of a band name, there's clearly plenty on <i>Out of View </i>to inspire massive eyerolls if you have even an ounce of cynicism in your body. And yet the album works way better than it probably ought to, and that's almost entirely due to the songwriting. The History of Apple Pie's core members--Minn and her boyfriend, guitarist Jerome Watson-- originally launched the group as a bedroom pop project, releasing their songs via MySpace. Over the last few years, they've become expert at turning out prime indie rock ear candy: Catchy riffs come fast and furiously, and ""Mallory"" is probably the finest example. In just over four minutes, it delivers crunchy, swaggering guitar melodies, big, fat drums that cut through the fog of sugar-coated noise, and Minn's gooey ""oh-oh-oh""s. ""I Want More"" supplements the formula with a swath of drones, ""Long Way to Go"" turns the volume down a fraction, and ""Before You Reach the End"" is a standard tripped-out closing number, with extra psychedelic guitar courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4990-the-horrors/"" target=""_blank"">the Horrors</a>' Joshua Hayward, who also mixed the record.</p>
<p>It should probably go without saying that <i>Out of View </i>isn't a terribly deep or meaningful record. Whether the History of Apple Pie retains its charm over the long haul very much remains to be seen. But taken for what it is—a fluffy, animated unicorn flying joyfully to college-rock Pleasure Town-- <i>Out of View</i> is a nice 40-minute respite from reality.</p></div>"|17569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17569-out-of-view/|6.7|Steven Hyden

But the relationship between counterculture and country music used to be quite cozy. Thanks to his influence on the Rolling Stones, Gram Parsons helped turn psychedelic rock fans on to the contemporary country sounds of the time, and country musicians returned the favor by introducing a stoner-friendly grooviness to their sound and image. (Check out Light in the Attic's fantastic compilation, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16886-country-funk-1969-1975/"" target=""_blank""><i>Country Funk 1969-1975</i></a>, to see how groovy things got.)</p>
<p><a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30985-chris-darrow/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Darrow</a> is a product of that union. He was a fixture of the L.A. music scene for years, best known as the co-founder of the psych rock outfit Kaleidoscope, and as an in-demand sideman who played alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"" target=""_blank"">Leonard Cohen</a>, Linda Ronstadt, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and James Taylor. His 1972 solo debut, <i>Artist Proof</i>, is close to the platonic ideal of the California country rock that was being produced at the time.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why is that over its dozen songs (and five bonus demo versions) you can hear pretty much every one of the sound's major touchstones at some point. Gram Parsons' influence looms large, as it did over every commingling of rock and country at the time. Darrow has the same laid back demeanor and enthusiasm for the kind of unabashedly twangy Bakersville country that was more often associated with shitkicking rednecks than longhairs. There's also some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a>'s effortlessly beautiful way with a melody, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4456-townes-van-zandt/"" target=""_blank"">Townes Van Zandt</a>'s moodiness, and a funky hippy streak that seems equally indebted to to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5843-grateful-dead/"" target=""_blank"">Grateful Dead</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/614-the-band/"" target=""_blank"">the Band</a>.</p>
<p><i>Artist Proof</i> has all of the distinguishing characteristics of a low-key release by a veteran working musician who's outgrown his own dreams of stardom: a backing band made up of other players from the session circuit, efficient and unflashy production, and a tiny initial pressing that seemed to guarantee its future obscurity. But like many such records, the few copies that were pressed were enough to grow a small but devoted cult around them. Luckily the cult has some influence at Drag City, which has earned itself a decent reputation for rescuing private press albums from absolute obscurity.</p>
<p>The difference between Darrow and past acts reissued by the label is that the others have mostly been obscure for justifiable reasons. The world was obviously not ready for a black protopunk band like Death, or an eccentric New Wave performance artist like J.T. IV, and for the most part it still isn't yet. But <i>Artist Proof</i> sounds like it could have been huge. Part of that is the fact that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22835-eagles/"" target=""_blank"">the Eagles</a> used an eerily similar combination of country twang, soft rock, urban counterculture cred, and peaceful, easy feelings to produce one of the highest-selling albums in the history of recorded music. (Their first record came out the same year as <i>Artist Proof</i>.) It also just feels somehow classic.</p>
<p>Darrow's voice was maybe not cut out to sell tens of millions of albums, but his songwriting talents should have elevated him much higher in the music business than he ended up. Listening through <i>Artist Proof</i>, it's hard not to play matchmaker between the songs and the more established and ambitious country artists from the 70s who could (and maybe should) have recorded them. ""Shawnee Moon"", with its juxtaposition of mellow midtempo funkiness and bittersweet melody and lyrics, would have fit in nicely on Emmylou Harris's <i>Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town</i>, next to the contributions of era-defining songwriters like Rodney Crowell and Guy and Susanna Clark. The fact that Linda Ronstadt never recorded the gorgeously sad ""Move on Down the Line"" is in itself heartbreaking.</p>
<p>But if the consolation prize is just finally having Darrow's album to listen to, that's perfectly fine. The phrase ""lost classic"" gets attached to inessential reissues with such regularity that it hardly means anything anymore, but <i>Artist Proof</i> genuinely deserves the title. It's deeply satisfying, constantly rewarding, and I'm not entirely sure what I was doing before it came into my life.</p></div>"|17592.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17592-artist-proof/|8.2|Miles Raymer

He's back as Hank Champion, the poet who talks about his sex life over a quaint country instrumental. Zig Speck and the Specktones, the garage rock band formerly fronted by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"" target=""_blank"">Ty Segall</a> in <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15067-100-records-volume-ii-i-miss-the-jams/"">Volume II</a></i>, return with an earwormy nugget called ""Fruitcakes"". He's a soul group, a reggae band, a folkie guitar picker, and a country balladeer. The LP has a similar aesthetic to one you might find from grabbing several 45s out of a bargain bin and putting them on a compilation. But here's the important bit-- even when he travels outside his comfort zone, Smith sounds decidedly like himself.</p>
<p>In an <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N26eYgdmZCM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview about the project</a> back in 2010, Smith hinted that he was less than confident in his ability to deliver such a wide range of songs. ""There was one guy that was kind of a reggae guy, and I don't play reggae music or whatever, so that was kind of tricky."" And in reference to the soul characters, ""I can't sing like Otis Redding or anything."" On paper, it makes sense that Smith's voice could potentially pose a limitation for those genres-- his voice is distinctively his own. But by side-stepping vocal affectations and delivering strong, tight arrangements, he's crafted some legitimately catchy reggae and soul songs. With a strong organ solo and a quiet, echoing piano driving the beat, ""Half Boy Half Girl"" is a reggae ballad that smacks of early American R&amp;B. (Makes sense-- the Wailers, after all, were inspired by that stuff.) And with a killer hook and some on-point back-up singers, ""A Steady Stream of Love"" is one of the best country soul throwbacks in recent memory.</p>
<p>The tinges of country in Smith's soul music make sense-- the most recent Sunsets album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16753-longtime-companion/""><i>Longtime Companion</i></a>, featured some beautiful country songs (""Year of the Cock"" appears there and here), and by letting himself stretch out under the guise of different personae, <i>Vol. 3</i> is a great venue for his knack with the genre. His two songs as Bobby Hawkins are maybe a bit too simplistic-- he delivers a lonesome howl on ""Minimum Wage"" and drawls out the titular lyrics of ""Difficulties, Mistakes and Errors"". He offers 1970s country rock barn burners (""Cosmorama"") alongside quiet Johnny Cash-like acoustic tracks (""Some Women Artists All Around Town"").</p>
<p><i>Vol. 3</i> is at its best when Smith is at his boldest, like when he's offering a cautionary tale to the masses (and the president) on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14689-if-you-dont-make-a-change/"">""If You Don't Make a Change""</a>. Although the instrumental tracks ""Medication"" and ""Wolf Like Howls From the Bathhouse"" are subdued by comparison, they serve the crucial role of offering a palate cleanser between stylistic shifts. And while you can almost always predict the genre by looking at the track and fake artist name (the Wayward Youth are behind the reggae song, Little Antoine and the Sparrows did the soul song), it's to Smith's credit that only one track, ""Space Travel's in My Blood"" by Earth Girl Helen Brown, feels like a throwaway novelty song due to its cartoonish sci-fi sonics. For an art project that's in constant danger of veering into gimmickry, his final <i>100 Records</i> collection is much stronger than it has any right to be.</p></div>"|17620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17620-100-records-vol-3/|7.4|Evan Minsker

For the first few <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2880-my-morning-jacket/"" target=""_blank"">My Morning Jacket</a> albums, he often recorded his vocals in an abandoned Kentucky grain silo, one of the few places that could give him the otherworldly reverb he desired. On any number of great My Morning Jacket songs-- ""Gideon"", ""The Way That He Sings"", ""Circuital"", ""Golden""-- there's that moment when James cuts loose the sandbags and lets his voice pull the songs heavenward. It's a move drawn from gospel, but although his awareness of mortality is a matter of public record, James has never really affiliated himself with a particular religious ideology. He's a seeker with a strong moral compass, cobbling together beliefs from wherever, and relying on his music to help him transcend the earthly realm.</p>
<p>If My Morning Jacket's albums have mostly come together like a revival meeting-- a group playing live, working together to create something larger than its members-- James' first solo album, <i>Regions of Light and Sound of God</i>,<i> </i>emerges from something closer to meditation. James holed himself away in his Louisville home studio, writing and piecing together songs, playing most of the parts himself. It's process-based music, and he admits it in the album's first seconds. On ""State of the Art (A.E.I.O.U.)"", James breaks his creative process down to its primordial elements-- vowels, nursery rhymes-- like he's leading a workshop on discovering one's inner poet. Like everything he does, it's deeply self-conscious, wholly earnest, and just a slight bit goofy. And like so many artists chin-deep in Pro Tools, James distances himself from the claim that he's using production devices (computer software or metal silo walls) as creative crutches. As ""A.E.I.O.U."" slithers to life with a sinuous piano figure, James relates his manifesto: ""I use my state of the art technology/ Now don't you forget it: it ain't usin' me.""</p>
<p>Mastery over technology is a fitting metaphor for <i>Regions</i>' core theme: exceeding limitations in the interest of personal reinvention. Where in title and subject matter, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15471-circuital/"" target=""_blank""><i>Circuital</i></a> marked a return to form for My Morning Jacket, <i>Regions </i>sees James pushing outward in all directions, stylistically and emotionally. At one extreme, there's the shimmering, nearly New Age ""Of the Mother Again"", suggesting the inevitability of change and the joy of falling in sync with nature's cycles. At the other end, there's ""Dear One"", with a retrofuturistic rhythm bed that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"" target=""_blank"">Stereolab</a>, and a title suggesting both a romantic ode and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">space exploration vehicle</a>, on which James sees a relationship as a galactic journey: ""You always pushed the boundaries of my soul/ With life and love we've finally gained control.""</p>
<p>Though his hippy undertones might suggest otherwise, <i>Regions</i> is about asserting control. Even on ""Mother"", the dewiest track, James follows one lyric about nothing staying the same for long with another-- ""close your eyes and its gone""-- that draws the song to a dramatic pause, before bringing it back with a funky rhythm section in tow. It's a theatrical moment on an album full of them-- <i>Regions</i> opens by channeling Traffic's 1971 glam-fusion epic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udyNr0pY6ak"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys""</a>, and throughout, James is as comfortable as ever in his <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxVlN-LzIks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Fantasy</a> guise. Even in My Morning Jacket's earliest moments, he's styled himself a ringleader capable of sonic wizardry, a strummy Southerner cut from the showy mold of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7104-elton-john/"" target=""_blank"">Elton John</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"" target=""_blank"">Wayne Coyne</a>.</p>
<p>On ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14755-a-new-life/"" target=""_blank"">A New Life</a>"", he turns a simple folk song into a showtune, in a way that nods toward <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"" target=""_blank"">Bowie</a>'s <i>Hunky Dory</i>. As the song plays out, James adds bits of musical scenery, as if stagehands keep rolling new canvas backdrops behind him. By the end, ""Life"" blossoms into musical theater, balancing sweetness and schmaltz in a way that only James can. He can't make an album without cheese, this much is obvious-- the less said about the well-intentioned Martin Luther King ode ""God's Love"", the better-- but as ""A New Life"" shows, when he's able to rein it in, the results are engrossing. (And when he can't help but crack up the second time he sings ""I think I'm really being sincere,"" you know he's in on his own joke.)</p>
<p><i>Regions</i>' best moments come when James' sense of wonder and fear are most palpable. On ""Know 'Til Now"", he channels a face-to-face-with-the-sublime feeling that leaves him wordless, though far from exultant. Sounding like a VHS recording of an old 16mm reel of a clipped sample of a long-unheard soul revue, ""Know"" took more than a few James fans aback as the album's first single. Yet as ""Wordless Chorus"" showed, he's uniquely capable of letting the spirit move him past the limits of language, and the lyrics to ""Know"" offer a glimpse into what feels like an inner monologue-- ""How could I have known/ How sweet it could be!""-- before he steps aside and lets the music take over. Instead of the beatific skyward glance we might expect, however, the song's sultry, Lynchian coda aims backward to My Morning Jacket's own genesis, painting from the same color palette as the doo-wop influenced <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WsWhQbT7cA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""They Ran""</a> from the band's 1999 debut. On ""Know""'s companion piece, ""All is Forgiven"", however, James finally lets his voice, spirit, fears, and hopes loose. As he wails, he's complemented not by a children's chorus or a pipe organ, but by a sweltering saxophone and mid-tempo rhythm section. It's a surreal effect: a sidelong glance at the expectations for such a song.</p>
<p>Isolation can often lead to indulgence, but not here. In less confident hands (including those of a younger Jim James), creative solitude could easily result in an unwieldly conceptual opus. Blessedly, <i>Regions</i> is the opposite: a svelte, sweet collection clocking in at under 40 minutes-- the shortest album of his career. While addressing the same themes he's been tweaking for more than a decade now, James adds a new trick to his ever-expanding repertoire: transforming the boundless possibilities of solo creativity into a cohesive one-man show.</p></div>"|17523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17523-regions-of-light-and-sound-of-god/|7.8|Eric Harvey

It's also the fuel driving <i>We the Common</i>, the fourth album from spirited folk-popper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5584-thao-with-the-get-down-stay-down/"" target=""_blank"">Thao Nguyen</a>. Including her three records with the Get Down Stay Down and a 2011 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29412-thao-mirah/"" target=""_blank"">collaboration</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2788-mirah/"" target=""_blank"">Mirah</a>, the prolific Nguyen has been involved in so many projects that she's spent most of her 20s on the road. Last year, when the rootlessness of the touring life was starting to get her down, she went out in conscious search of that elusive life experience-- or, in her words, ""I wanted to try to be a real live person, rather than just singing songs about them."" So she settled in San Francisco. She didn't write much, and instead did some deep thinking about her life's direction. She made an effort to be a part of her community, spending time working with an organization that advocates for prisoners' rights. Then, she did what most creative people in self-conscious pursuit of ""life experience"" end up doing: she used it to write some new songs. For a record she'll inevitably tour. The cycle of rootlessness continues.</p>
<p>But on <i>We the Common</i>, her most sharply written record to date, she's well aware of that irony. Its 12 songs are smart, sometimes piercingly self-aware meditations on the creative life, teasing out the tension between life and art, the individual and the community-- and perhaps most of all-- security and restlessness. ""We love some strangers every night,"" she sings with mock-flippancy on ""We Don't Call"", which is as much about the emotional stamina required to regularly pour your heart out on stage as it is the havoc that lifestyle can wreak on long-term relationships. Like most of the songs on <i>We The Common</i>, the arrangement is nimble and the instrumentation is varied but never overcrowded-- a vibraphone tiptoes around the vocal melody and horns accent but don't overpower the emotional nuances of her lyrics. ""Bye bye baby, I'm going to work/ Chase myself all over the earth,"" she sings later, with a subtle tinge of weariness.</p>
<p><i>We the Common</i>'s best songs are its most dynamic. ""City"" is driving, percussive, and dotted with distorted guitar riffs that touch down unexpectedly, like lightning bolts. The chaotic and kinetic ""Move"" seems to pick up a few tricks from Nguyen's pal Merrill Garbus of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27618-tune-yards/"" target=""_blank"">tUnE-yArDs</a>-- lurching at a midtempo stagger that suddenly explodes into one of the record's most satisfying moments, when Nguyen shakes off her composure and screams, ""Oh, to be free!"" From a distance, it would be too easy for those with the oft-diagnosed allergy to uptempo banjos and vibraphone solos to dismiss Nguyen as ""quirky,"" but closer listens even to her earliest records show that her lyrics and sound have always packed an unexpectedly blunt punch. John Congleton's excellent production emphasizes the jagged edges and negative space, making each sound pop as vividly as he did on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"" target=""_blank"">St. Vincent</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15813-strange-mercy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Strange Mercy</i></a>.</p>
<p>And speaking of indie marquee names, the song on <i>We the Common</i> liable to generate the most chatter is probably ""Kindness Be Conceived"", a sprightly and predictably pastoral duet with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"" target=""_blank"">Joanna Newsom</a>. (According to Thao, the two met somewhere that I assure you is not a soundstage for a ""Portlandia"" sketch but an actual place in the world: ""a Virginia Woolf-style farm paradise where women writers get their own cabins and write all day and meet in the evening for dinner."") Pleasant as it is, it's not one of the album's most memorable songs, and the irrepressible quirk in Newsom's voice only highlights the biggest issue with <i>We The Common</i>: Nguyen doesn't always have the personality to sell these songs. Her voice has a tendency to go a little monochrome, and this causes some of the slower numbers, like ""Clouds for Brains"" and ""The Day Long"", to fade into indistinct and unmemorable hues. On ""Kindness"", both vocalists sing the same melody over the top of each other, but it's the magnetic charisma of Newsom's that draws you in.</p>
<p>Still, Nguyen's most quietly affecting vocal comes in the last song, ""Age of Ice"", another track that seems to address the emotional life of the wanderer. It's a song about survival-- the necessity of acting tough and building up defenses (""What of all the stone I invented/ To coat my hands and my face""), but it also contains the possibility of a thaw. ""I remember you with a feeling or two,"" she sings with a hint of self-deprecation, as though she's wishing to feel and experience more. But ultimately <i>We the Common</i> shows that ""life experience"" can happen anywhere-- even in a cramped tour bus or on a brightly lit stage. Nguyen may have spent her youth unconventionally, but that doesn't mean she's not ""a real live person."" Her songs are stuffed with the wisdom and strengths she gained from her years on the road-- resilience, hopefulness, and self-reliance. ""Rest and be strong, wash and be clean,"" she sings in the powerful last seconds of ""City"". ""Start a new year whenever you need.""</p></div>"|17577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17577-we-the-common/|7.5|Lindsay Zoladz

Yeah, that just about covers it. After a nearly six-year absence, art-metal megatron <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4257-tomahawk/"" target=""_blank"">Tomahawk</a>-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"" target=""_blank"">Jesus Lizard</a> guitarist Duane Denison, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1922-helmet/"" target=""_blank"">Helmet</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"" target=""_blank"">Battles</a> drummer John Stanier, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1451-fantomas/"" target=""_blank"">Fantmas</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"" target=""_blank"">Melvins</a> bassist (and newest recruit) Trevor Dunn, and Mike Patton, man of a million voices and just about as many bands-- have returned with <i>Oddfellows</i> their fourth LP. Recorded with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"" target=""_blank"">Black Keys</a> producer Collin Dupuis at the blooz-rockers' Nashville studio, <i>Oddfellows</i> has been touted as Tomahawk's most straightforward, stripped-down release to date. That's true enough. But a lifetime of weirdness means these four guys are pretty much incapable of doing anything the normal way. So just because <i>Oddfellows</i> doesn't run quite as crooked as the Tomahawk records that preceded it doesn't mean it isn't pretty bent. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Because of scheduling conflicts, Tomahawk records tend to come together quickly; these are not people with a lot of down time. But <i>Oddfellows</i>, written in and recorded in something like four days' time, was actually the most time-intensive Tomahawk LP so far; in interviews, Nashvillian Denison seems pleased they actually had time to go out and grab a little barbecue between takes. The tension between these guys' undeniable chops and the all-but-forced spontaneity of this music's formation is the fuel behind Tomahawk's fire; even when they've barely got half an idea between the four of them, they play the hell out of it. Stanier, as ever, remains rock-solid, yet oddly playful behind the kit; there's a reason he's one of the few drummers non-drummers know by name. Dunn-- filling the spot Kevin Rutmanis left vacant on 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10361-anonymous/"" target=""_blank""><i>Anonymous</i></a>-- gets in where he fits in; after all but walking away with Melvins' fine 2012 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16685-freak-puke/"" target=""_blank""><i>Freak Puke</i></a>, Dunn hangs back here, ably holding down the low end without overasserting himself. It's Denison who leads the charge. Practically from the first seconds, his guitar seethes and snaps like a dog on a leash, the riffs lunging at your face, looking to break the skin.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As for Patton, let's just say age does not appear to be mellowing the man. One minute, he's on the ground, slithering, saying something vile; the next, he's pleading, full-throated, desperation on his breath. It's still a strange kind of thrill, hearing him bounce around a track like this, and if you like what he does, there's no shortage of the stuff here. Though close listens will turn up plenty of jittery Pattonisms way back in the mix-- I'm partial to the cheeky ""bum-b-bum-bum"" in the otherwise leering ""Choke Neck""-- the trademark tics mostly take a backseat to what, for Patton, scans as fairly ""normal"" singing. Still, you throw a yowling Patton against a Denison firecracker like ""South Paw"" or <i>Oddfellows</i>' title track, and you're pretty much bound to hit something. Denison's said he'd like <i>Oddfellows</i>, unlike the jitterier, more outwardly experimental Tomahawk LPs that came before, to be the kind of thing you'd want to see on a big stage, beer in hand. With riffs as colossal as the ones under ""Oddfellows"" and the looser, menage-nodding ""Waratorium"", it's not hard to picture.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Still, being as preternaturally disposed to weirdness as these guys are, <i>Oddfellows</i> all but refuses to take the path of least resistance. For every forward-marching ""Oddfellows"", there's an unholy jazz-grunge-""Cop Killer"" mutant like ""Rise Up Dirty Waters"", or an open-ended creeper like ""Baby Let's Play ____"", swelling like the score to a dusty horror flick. By and large, these songs rarely end up anywhere near where they started, or where you'd expect them to. For a listener, this has kind of a decentering effect; with all the moving parts-- and especially with Patton slinking around in the corners, looking for a good place to scream-- you could play <i>Oddfellows</i> a couple dozen times and still not feel like you'd caught everything it throws at you. But keeping things a little uncomfortable is certainly the goal here; these songs have this kind of festering, acid-stomach chemistry to them, weird and unsettling even when they're not particularly trying to be. And even the more straightforward stuff here get a little grislier once Patton comes along: he speaks of faces in pillows, makes a request for rope. <i>Oddfellows</i> leaves you constantly on edge, bludgeoned with riffs, gleefully dreading another of Patton's not-so-sweet-nothings, waiting for these songs to jerk you into another time signature or maybe another genre altogether.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Oddfellows</i> occasionally falters at the extremes; dragginess sets in whenever tempos sink too low for too long, and without the occasional break, the spasticity of some of their sharper turns can be a little crazy-making. Good as these guys are at mashing up genres on the fly, there's no denying the straighter, fist-pumpier stuff here works best; too many more like ""Oddfellows"" might throw the record's dark-to-somewhat-less-dark ratio off, but a couple more in that vein couldn't have hurt cohesion any. And, as with any project that comes together this quickly, you're left to wonder how much different (and, quite possibly, better) things could've been had these guys had a little more time to kick around Nashville and get reacquainted. Still, working at this clip gives just about everything on <i>Oddfellows</i> a kind of first-take urgency, a feeling that, whenever you get these guys in the same room, this music-- this lurid, thorny, profoundly weird music-- just comes tearing out.</p></div>"|17602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17602-oddfellows/|6.8|Paul Thompson

Point being, before they started learning how to namedrop canonical influences, many groups who qualify as ""indie"" in 2013 likely had formative experiences around the last time buzzy, commercially ambitious, and only vaguely ""alternative"" guitar rock was still a going, multiplatinum concern. I'd bet that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29669-guards/"" target=""_blank"">Guards</a> fits that description, and even if they don't, their eager-to-please debut, <i>In Guards We Trust</i>, will certainly appeal to anyone who secretly<i> </i>wishes for the return of the late 90s culture fostered by ""120 Minutes"" and pre-Clear Channel alt.rock radio. By the same token, the clearly skewed hit-to-filler ratio will trigger fond memories in anyone who visited their used CD store as much as the Tower Records.</p>
<p>By no means is <i>In Guards We Trust </i>a literal recreation of Buzz Bin nostalgia. There <i>are </i>plenty of zippy, palm-muted riffs and crate-digging genre touches: a driving soul rhythm powers the curiously murky opener ""Nightmare"", ""Can't Repair"" is blown-out Motown, the coed ""Your Man"" boasts dark C&amp;W twang. But <i>In Guards We Trust </i>sounds like it lives in 2013, as the emphasis on low-end throughout indicates that hip-hop was a likely framing device. If that sounds like what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28665-cults/"" target=""_blank"">Cults</a> do, there's good reason: Guards frontman Richie Follin is the brother of Cults' Madeline, and before they shared stages, one can easily imagine the two pop obsessives fighting over the radio dial or remote as kids and eventually trying to top each other as songwriters.</p>
<p>When it comes to writing big hooks, Richie may have the upper hand. Come to think of it, ""hooks"" doesn't do them justice-- you could reel in baleen whales using the sort of arena-rock gestures ""Coming True"" and ""Giving Out"" are working with, and they're all pumped up in some way: big washes of reverb, massed vocals, unison guitar bends. They aren't even remotely original in melody or theme, but if no one else is using them these days, what's stopping Guards?</p>
<p>There's certainly a thrill in such unabashedly anthemic rock music when few bands have an interest in making it, let alone an ability to follow through. But after the fizz of ""Silver Lining"" and ""Give Out"" wears out, Follin starts to feel like a jingle writer stuck in the wrong format. At best, the verses, bridges, and instrumental passages feel custodial, doing little to disturb the flow so that the chorus can deliver a proper dynamic boost. Mostly, they just feel like Guards killing time, and Follin's power-pop Madlibs (""If I were to take the lead/ Teach me how to turn the key/ Tell me how to set you free"") make the 45 minutes of <i>In Guards We Trust </i>feel significantly longer. Not that we should demand nuance from this sort of big-tent stuff, but by the time those hooks lodge in your memory, they're so vaguely worded-- ""we're up and ready to go!"" ""I feel it giving out/ Your clock is running out,"" ""Now it's all coming true/ What's a boy supposed to do/ With a girl like you?""-- you just wish there was <i>something </i>that convinced you these songs couldn't just as easily have been written about low APR financing or the nutritional utility of Bagel Bites.</p>
<p>The comparison is easy and perhaps unfair, but look at how Cults maintain a perspective and personality that projects outwards through their influences, whereas Guards let their influences substitute for personality. While Third Eye Blind's ""Semi-Charmed Life"", Marcy Playground's ""Sex &amp; Candy"", and the Verve Pipe's ""The Freshmen"" were and still are seen as innocuous, alt-rock trifles, they have real stories behind them (seriously, Wikipedia them all). As for Guards, whenever the big hook inevitably hits, the celebratory becomes perfunctory, no different than a TGI Friday's wait staff member forcing themselves to sing ""Happy Birthday"" over a giant plate of loaded potato skins for the twelfth time that night.</p></div>"|17611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17611-in-guards-we-trust/|5.9|Ian Cohen

They pervert nearly every USBM stereotype imaginable, and it's been both a blessing and a curse for the strangely underrated quartet. Now, with <i>Baphometic Chaosium</i>, they've upped the ante and produced something even more alienating and vile than their previous efforts.</p>
<p>Heavily informed by late-period Mayhem (especially <i>Chimera</i> and <i>Ordo Ad Chao</i>), early Marduk, and <i>Into the Pandemonium</i>-era Celtic Frost, <i>Baphometic Chaosium</i> is an engaging, aggressive, and unapologetically strange collection of semi-modern black metal. The tone and execution harken back to times past; there's no hint of watered-down ""post"" anything here. The title track comes slithering into earshot on the heels of a funeral procession, slowly building in intensity and menace until it explodes into a demonstration of what furious, violent black metal is meant to sound like, replete with razor-edged solo and hoarse, demonic growls.</p>
<p>After the stage has been set, ""Acid Gate"" stretches on through nearly seven minutes of sluggish blasting, crowned by Autarch's most scintillatingly strange vocal performance yet, resulting in moments of lugubrious, hollow chanting straight out of vampiric B-movie hell. There's no time to rest here, no lulls of tranquility or homogeny. The woozy beginnings of"" Psychic Waters"" jolt into furious blasts of vociferous death metal and dissonant, churning riffs. The instrumental ""Cloven Shields"" is less a palate cleanser than a cursed omen of further torments to come. Its shuddering, Goblin-esque soundscape is strewn with doleful minor keyed melodies and sweeping synth lines that evoke gothic horror and sonic ruin, ushering in the slow, refined dissonance of ""Chained to Decay"". Lightning Swords of Death sink into the depths of death/doom on this one, with its crawling tempo, strangled howls, and half-melted Celtic Frost riffs that end in a drawn-out, bilious croak fading into the distance.</p>
<p>""R'Lyeh Wuurm"" segues straight back into blackened fury, boasting tight, controlled blasts, and near-martial drumming that crashes into the eight-minute fever dream of ""Epicyclarium"". Autarch's dolorous chants resurface, his voice distorted and dampened, and serve as a focal point amidst the swirling chaos of spring-wound tremolo picking and inhumanly precise blastbeats that soon break down into a supremely headbangable, mid-tempo swagger before clawing its way back towards the void. Album closer ""Oaken Chrysalis"" stays firmly in the tried and true, uptempo, slightly polished black metal camp (the only indication that Lightning Swords of Death have spend any time over the past nine years in the sunshine, or outside of their own record collections) and even this collapses into pulsing noise and creepy spoken invocations.</p>
<p><i>Baphometic Chaosium</i> is worth your attention, full stop. It shuns sentimental atmospherics and self-conscious experimentation, ignoring anything but the band members' own interests, influences, and addictions. There is no pretension, no illusion. There is only darkness, evil, and bloodlust. This is the kind of American black metal that we should be known for, and Lightning Swords of Death deserve some fucking credit.</p></div>"|17606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17606-baphometic-chaosium/|7.8|Kim Kelly

His observation about the Fall captures a broader idea about music fandom, describing what it's like to follow along with a gifted artist who has created her own style but is no hurry to move outside of it. <i>Always different, always the same</i>. It's a phrase that comes to mind for me when I listen to the charred ambient music of Liz Harris' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"" target=""_blank"">Grouper</a>. Her body of work is of a piece. She layers ethereal vocals that feel less like floating in the clouds and more like sinking into the dark earth, possibly while inside of a coffin; her music is a downcast mix of strummed acoustic guitar and defiantly analog sounding drone and noise-makers. With this small clutch of elements, she's made more than a half-dozen full-lengths and a number of singles and EPs, all of which sound like they could come from no one else. Indeed, the distinctiveness of Grouper is easy to take for granted. There are so many people making music that could fall under the broad heading of ""dream pop,"" but <i>nobody </i>sounds like Grouper. </p>
<p class=""p1"">There is one record in the Grouper catalog that, while certainly cut from the same frayed cloth, stands just slightly outside of the rest. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12119-dragging-a-dead-deer-up-a-hill/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill</i></a>, first released in 2008, mostly forgoes the drones and minimalist experiments of her other work and focuses on Harris' voice and strummed guitar. It's her ""folk"" record, in a way, even though it slots in easily next to her more drawn-out and noisy releases. It is also her best album, a classic of subtly devastating songwriting (it's also an album Pitchfork <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12119-dragging-a-dead-deer-up-a-hill/"" target=""_blank"">initially underrated</a>). Around the same time she was recording <i>Deer</i>, Harris cut a handful of songs in a similar vein for a planned album that was never released. Five years on comes <i>The Man Who Died in the Boat</i>, a companion record to <i>Deer</i> (which Kranky is also reissuing on vinyl) that shares many of its characteristics and essential appeal. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Grouper's most obvious contemporary is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27876-julianna-barwick/"" target=""_blank"">Julianna Barwick</a>, but while the latter's music has a certain formality and sense of communal ritual, Grouper is disconcertingly interior, as if you're listening in on something private. That feeling is reinforced by the more abstract moments here, which often feel like something tinkered with over many hours in a dark room. The opening ""6"" finds Harris' voice on a damaged tape, bubbling up from the depths and mixing with swirls of feedback. The haunted ""Vanishing Point"" consists only of warbly metallic pings over a deep bed of tape hiss. The instrumental interludes aren't necessarily much to listen to on their own (and Harris' personal stamp on them is not as strong), but they do serve a purpose on the album, mixing up the flow of acoustic songs that might otherwise start to bleed together. But placed in relief by the abstracted bits, the individual character of the acoustic songs becomes apparent.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill</i> had one of the more striking album covers in recent memory. It's a photo of Harris as a small child, wearing heavy makeup and a black dress that could look like a witch's costume. Though she doesn't generally seem interested in conveying the exact meaning of her songs and leaves a certain amount of that to the listener, the unsettling side of childhood innocence is a pervasive theme in her music. On the best of the songs here, like ""Clouds in Places"", the title track, ""Cover the Long Way"", Harris sounds very much like she's taking sing-song rhymes from childhood and running them through a cracked and ashen filter. They radiate a beauty that is simultaneously light and dark, with bright melodies draped with the inevitability of death.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The title of this release extends that idea, alluding to a scene from Harris' childhood where she and her father came upon an empty boat that drifted to shore after the person in it disappeared. It's one of those flashes from long ago that stays with you, an early brush with the idea of mortality at a time when you're not capable of understanding exactly what it means. That sense of confusion, the difficulty of processing and articulation, seems built into Grouper's art. Talking to people about her music, people who are typically ready to share half-formed opinions about music of any kind, I find they often have trouble coming up with words; when it really hits, as it often does here, the music of Grouper creates a feeling that can only be defined as awe, an uncanny mixture of wonder and dread that nobody does better. </p></div>"|17571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17571-the-man-who-died-in-his-boat-dragging-a-dead-deer-up-a-hill/|8.3|Mark Richardson

It was the same year that the then-young producer had released his debut album <i>Dialogue</i> under the moniker <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>, and the set was quick to reveal the him as a quirky experimental producer whose approach built on the sound of his post-rock high-school band Fridge. This high school, it <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-real-school-of-rock-780693.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">turns out</a>, was the Elliott School in Putney, a visual and performing arts school that counts members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"" target=""_blank"">Hot Chip</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"" target=""_blank"">the xx</a>, and William Bevan of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a> as alumni (all three would later collaborate with Four Tet). Which brings us to <i>0181</i>, a collection of the producer's unreleased works from those early years-- starting from 1997 through the material made around the time of his second full-length, <i>Pause</i>, in 2001-- that Hebden issued <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/four-tet/0181-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to SoundCloud</a> for free last week.</p>
<p><i>0181</i> as a whole serves as a reminder of the cyclic nature of this kind of instrumental production. Creating the electronic music of the future involves sifting through the past to re-discover sounds. <i>0181 </i>bring to mind this sort of time-shift not because the sounds within are regressive, but rather because despite their 12-16 years of being hidden away, they feel surprisingly fresh. Made public as one long 38-minute track, <i>0181</i> has the flow of a mixtape, a wide-ranging showcase for Hebden's early production flair. Unconnected in any real way beyond their sequencing are hushed melodic interludes, moments of ambient static, jazzy constructions, and the naked bones of early 2-step. </p>
<p>At times it can be frustrating simply because the abrupt ends of some of the minute-long tracks leave us wanting more. The first thing we hear is a glimmering shower of piano keys that recalls some of Hebden's lush recent work like like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17093-pink/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pink</i></a>'s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13568-jupiters/"" target=""_blank"">Jupiters</a>"", but then this sound dies out and we're then launched into scattered 2-step percussion. Twenty-eight-or-so minutes in you'll find folky, syncopated guitar plugs that serve as a reminder of why Four Tet was branded with the briefly fashionable term ""folktronica."" The jazz-inflected tracks that foreshadow Hebden's later <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27578-kieran-hebdan-and-steve-reid/"" target=""_blank"">collaborative projects</a> with percussionist Steve Reid (<i>The Exchange Sessions</i>, <i>Tongues</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12440-nyc/"" target=""_blank""><i>NYC</i></a>) are where <i>0181</i> stretches the farthest and has the most room to develop, and these tracks also sound the most fixed in time. But even these moments pass quickly: around 20 minutes in, a lazy tune grooves along at the hands of a dreamy, smoky horn melody and a drum-kit, and it lasts all of three minutes.</p>
<p>In unearthing and presenting his earlier work now, Hebden accidentally proves that consistency is his strongest asset. His 15 years of music can easily be viewed through the lens of this scattered set, and it strikes the same chords now as it did then, in terms of both construction and feelings. All along, he's been building nuanced cinematic landscapes brimming with exploration. </p></div>"|17681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17681-0181/|7.3|Puja Patel

It's the kind of voice that popstars used to have in the days before AutoTune, perma-grins, and mandatory teeth whitening. Warmly scratchy, it tickles the subconscious as he searches for words, and frays charmingly as he reaches for the big notes. It's a voice that wears its heart on its sleeve; emotions etched in sky-high letters with every breath. While he can't hide the heavy sense of disillusionment that imbues his every note, equally present is an almost child-like stubbornness; a playfully shirty refusal to be engulfed by misery.</p>
<p>London's Joe Flory, the man behind Amateur Best, has been here before. He played the popstar game at major label level as previous incarnation, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28371-primary-1/"">Primary 1</a>, where his messy, heartfelt songs were shoehorned into pastel-colored pop videos desperate to be hits. The hunger didn't suit his aesthetic or temperament, and he killed off the project almost as soon as he had released his debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15244-other-people/""><i>Other People</i></a>. I'd interviewed him for <a href=""http://www.dummymag.com/features/2009/08/08/primary-1-it-s-almost-like-catchphrase-music-/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Dummy</i></a> in summer 2009, a few months before its release, and even then reluctance streamed out of his every pore.</p>
<p>A couple of years on, reborn as Amateur Best, Flory has found a home with indie label Double Denim [run by Pitchfork contributor, Hari Ashurst]-- where, one imagines, the pressure and control are flipped to more agreeable levels-- and has made an album that marries hooks and heart to soul-satisfying ends. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/15-no-thrills/"" target=""_blank""><i>No Thrills</i></a> is pop is of the homemade kind, as flagged by the comic, 3D world he painstakingly made and photographed for his album artwork, but it's in no way lo-fi. It's boldly rendered, and somehow crafts a very human world from cartoon sonics. Squeezed synths, squeaky brass, sliding whistles, and pre-set keyboard melodies are all deployed at various points, yet in Flory's hands they assume a peculiar beauty. The forced sunniness of Primary 1 has been shooed away, leaving an acutely refined understanding of the importance of subtlety; how the biggest hooks are not necessarily the loudest, but the ones that keep you waiting.</p>
<p>Opener ""Ready for the Good Life"", featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7569-gonzales/"">Chilly Gonzales</a> on piano, is a perfect case in point. In your memory, it sounds huge, but the reality is much quieter. Flory isn't one to overplay, and it's what he holds back that gives his performance its power and poignancy. The good life, however, is not really any concern of <i>No Thrills</i>. Instead it gently unpicks the delusional idea that a constant state of happiness is possible. Allusions to depression stalk his songs, lurking under the melodies. Over the title track's bubbling percussion he sweetly strains to sing: ""No thrills, no high/ But I was right the first time/ It spills, it chimes/ Brain pain in the family line."" Yet every sour word is wrapped in a sweet note, and every painful revelation coiled in a soaring chorus. <i>No Thrills</i> never wallows but instead finds a joyful rhythm with an everyday battle.</p>
<p>Happy-sad is pop's holy grail: the hooks that lift and the lyrics that burn. In <i>No Thrills</i>' finest moments-- ""Too Much"" with its tortured sax and guitar work that evokes the Cure, the soul-searching ""Be Happy"" and its sad rumba rhythm, the sighing soul of ""Walk In Three""-- <i>No Thrills</i> reaches that grail, triumphantly. While not exactly damp squibs, ""Pleased"" and ""In Time"" don't quite have the force that the rest of the album possesses. Maybe because their self-consciously offbeat bounce could have sat comfortably on <i>Other People</i>, though part of the lasting pleasure of <i>No Thrills</i> is that Flory has delivered on his early promise. He no longer sounds reluctant at all.</p></div>"|17636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17636-no-thrills/|7.5|Ruth Saxelby

He was right, but in the two years and change since then, no city besides maybe Chicago has been able to keep up with the Big Apple's steady outpouring of buzzing MCs.

In other boroughs, everything from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Action Bronson</a>'s free-associative id to the mid-90s East Coast revivalism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Joey Bada$$</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29952-mr-muthafuckin-exquire/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire</a>'s kinetic Def Jux pastiche has made its way above ground. Not all of these guys are stars, exactly, but the ""New New York"" tag they've collectively attracted makes some sense.</p>
<p>Vado's not really part of all that. Instead, he's been salvaging whatever life <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6650-diplomats/"" target=""_blank"">Dipset</a> has left in it while Max B is locked up, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/937-camron/"" target=""_blank"">Cam'ron</a> hasn't released a solo album since 2009, and Juelz Santana, though he's finally released his long-anticipated <i>God Will'n</i>, has been mostly invisible. But while the 27-year old is still synonymous with Cam-- together they released the five-installment <i>Boss of All Bosses</i> mixtape series, 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15391-gunz-n-butta/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Gunz n' Butta</a></i> LP, and last year's mostly fruitless <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16423-camronski-beatzvado-blu-tops/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Blu Tops</a></i> EP-- he's slowly been distancing himself from his mentor, to the point that the latter doesn't make a single appearance on the new <i>Slime Flu 3</i>. That never proves to be a big problem, though. More refined than last year's crudely mastered <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16146-vado-slime-flu-2/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">2</a></i>, and more varied than the 2010 original, it's Vado's most definitive showing yet, and proof that he deserves to be a fixture in the contemporary New York rap conversation.</p>
<p>The 17-track, 70-minute tape has everything that's served Vado's releases well in the past-- liberal use of his ""Sliiiime!"" adlib, lots of sports references, a couple of whopping beats from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">AraabMuzik</a>. But more importantly, it takes the things we've come to expect from him and, on a few occasions, gets the utmost out of them. Araab's productions, ""The Awards"" and ""Niggaz Sleep on Me"", are total rave-ups, as strong as anything he did for <i>Gunz n' Butta</i>. ""My Team Go"", all low-end judder and air-raid sirens courtesy of the Pennsylvania-based Stoopid on da Beat, is a variation on Meek Mill's ""Burn"", but there's just a little more craft at work here than there is on its precedent. Vado might never give us a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m60XKqEEnfg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">""Hey Ma""</a> or a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2JfY-nVaqg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">""We Fly High""</a>, but songs like these, on which he blusters through titanic beats with galvanizing taunts and general defiance, are exactly what he should be doing.</p>
<p><i>3</i>'s most impressive feat, though, might be the quality control it maintains even as it detours into sounds and styles that Vado attempts less frequently. ""Bad Bitches"" is the tape's one attempt at a club smash, but where a lesser MC might coast on such a track, saying something about molly and letting the beat do most of the work, Vado brings to it some of his most inspired rapping on the tape. The six-minute ""When I Die"", by contrast, is a glimpse of his underrated narrative abilities and wouldn't sound out of place on a latter-day Wu record, bedecked with meandering horns and barely present drum patterns. Even the two <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Lana Del Rey</a>-sampling tracks (again: the two Lana Del Rey-sampling tracks) sound worlds more natural than they do gimmicky, which is further testimony to Vado's acumen and versatility.</p>
<p>Then again, Fred the Godson, JR Writer, and Chinx Drugz account for 60% of <i>3</i>'s features-- Vado doesn't appear all that concerned with what's in vogue in the first place. More fashionable decisions could yield greater returns over the short-term, but catering to trends of any kind often pigeonholes and limits the longevity of artists, especially in rap. Vado knows this, and if he continues to release projects as solid as this one, there'll always be a place for him.</p></div>"|17694.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17694-slime-flu-3/|7.0|Mike Madden

Their spaced-out 2011 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15602-actually/"" target=""_blank"">Actually</a>,</i> reliably translated leftfield influences-- new age, dub, early electronic experimentation-- into a more approachable experience. The result was testament to the group's good taste and unconventional leanings (they released an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16310-dub-the-world-actually-remixed/"" target=""_blank"">all-dub remix version</a> of it the same year), if not a little shaky getting on its feet-- groove-friendly, sure, but lacking in quantifiable oomph. But with <i>Cold War</i> La Big Vic make a crucial leap, tightening up what made them unique to offer one of the best outsider pop records of the young year.</p>
<p>You could almost run <i>Actually</i> right into <i>Cold War</i> without batting an eyelash, if it weren't for the fact that they've blown everything widescreen. ""Cold War"" is an affirming opening, and for all its familiar synthetic percolations and winsome, melodic loftiness, there's a serious rhythmic backbone that places its feet firmly on the ground, sounding like something the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"" target=""_blank"">Chemical Brothers</a> of the late 1990s would kick themselves for not thinking of first. This reinvigorated focus on beats-- trip-hoppy at times, chugging and mechanical at others-- now frames the komische flourishes and prog flirtations in a context that's almost radio-friendly. La Big Vic's third eye still remains firmly intact, but instead of making music built for headphones, <i>Cold War</i> is a record meant to be played out in the open; music that can fill a room and move with the fickle ebb and flow of the people in it, proving delightfully distracting for snatches of time.</p>
<p>This might lead you to believe that La Big Vic are merely jukebox junkies, but these songs are anything but convoluted or over-stuffed. At no point does it feel as if you're listening to the product of messy curation or some soupy free-for-all. Every song here has both intention and decent structure: The addictive ""All That Heaven Allows"" builds itself around a tweaked-out video game synth, yet feels like deeply funky, aqueous lounge music. ""Nuclear Bomb"" is perhaps more Falco than Kraftwerk, but gets its kicks from a giddy rush of glitter punk. ""Save the Ocean"" knocks off Danny Elfman's <i>Pee-wee</i> score in a deliciously demented way, adding a graveyard creep.</p>
<p>There are better songs yet on the record, including ""Emilie Say's"", which showcases Friedlander's vocals nicely; she can wrap a melody around the swirling music in an unexpectedly catchy, chameleonic fashion.

With somewhat less panache, Davis completists have pegged the group the Lost Quintet, since, unlike the two longstanding Davis five-pieces that preceded it, this one never made a proper studio recording. All of the members-- saxophonist Wayne Shorter, keyboardist Chick Corea, bassist Dave Holland and drummer Jack DeJohnette-- appear on 1970's landmark <i>Bitches Brew</i> and other scattered sessions from the time, but only as part of larger ensembles; until now, if you wanted to hear them as a stripped-down unit, you had to consult imports, bootlegs and YouTube. This second installment in the Miles Davis Bootleg Series, which follows an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15887-the-bootleg-series-volume-1-live-in-europe-1967"" target=""_blank"">excellent 2011 set</a> focusing on the trumpeter's prior working band, gives us three complete Lost Quintet gigs, plus the majority of a fourth, on three CDs and one DVD. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It's a real trove, and not just because this lineup is relatively obscure. In a very clear way, the Lost Quintet is the pivot point between the two main phases of Miles' 40-plus-year career: the acoustic jazz idiom he inhabited, and eventually revolutionized, from the mid-'40s through the late '60s, and the plugged-in ensembles he would lead until his death in 1991. In other words, if you've ever wondered exactly how the dapper jazzman of <i>Kind of Blue</i> morphed into a loudly attired icon in wraparound shades, this set offers some crucial clues. When we last left Miles, on <i>The Bootleg Series, Volume 1</i>, he was leading the world's most advanced and telepathic acoustic jazz group (the so-called Second Great Quintet); by the time of the gigs on <i>Live in Europe 1969</i>, Miles was straddling the fault line. He had already traded acoustic piano for overdriven electric keys and had begun taking rhythmic and textural cues from contemporary funk, but he hadn't yet entered his psychedelic-groove-machine phase in earnest. (For an early taste of the latter, try the 2001 Miles archival release <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2197-live-at-the-fillmore-east-march-7-1970-its-about-that-time"" target=""_blank"">Live at the Fillmore East (March 7, 1970)</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2197-live-at-the-fillmore-east-march-7-1970-its-about-that-time"" target=""_blank"">: It's About that Time</a></i>, which features Shorter, Corea, Holland-- who had switched to electric bass in the interim-- and DeJohnette, as well as percussionist Airto Moreira.) Unlike the groups that succeeded it, the Lost Quintet shared a significant portion of its DNA with the acoustic, jazz-centric Miles ensembles that came before.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is especially apparent on the first two sets here: good-sounding, often-bootlegged performances recorded over successive July nights at the 1969 Juan-les-Pins Jazz Festival in Antibes, France. The scope of these concerts is remarkable. You hear pieces from the yet-unrecorded <i>Bitches Brew</i> (""Spanish Key,"" ""Miles Runs the Voodoo Down""); a track from the ethereal masterpiece <i>In a Silent Way</i> (""It's About That Time""), recorded that past February but not yet released; staples of the Second Great Quintet repertoire (including ""Masqualero"" and ""Footprints,"" both by Shorter, the sole holdover from that band); and themes Miles had favored since the late 50s (""Milestones,"" ""Round Midnight"")-- all flowing together in the expertly paced suites that were Miles' onstage trademark. But the repertoire is only half of the story; as always with Miles groups, the personnel is the thing. Like the members of the Second Great Quintet, these musicians, aside from the relatively unknown Holland, were already rising or established stars when Miles recruited them. They make for a deadly team, equally at home with low-down groove, in-the-pocket swing and feverish abstraction. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The group displays its raucous intensity right from the start of the first Antibes set. During opener ""Directions,"" Corea, Holland and DeJohnette send some serious whitewater their boss's way, in the form of a near-chaotic proto-breakbeat. Miles responds with a brief but explosive solo, full of blaring peaks and bravura runs. If drummer Tony Williams was the chief upsetter in the Second Great Quintet-- furnishing near-constant turbulence to the delight of his employer-- the entire rhythm section takes on that role in the Lost Quintet. When Davis isn't playing, they get straight-up Dionysian. The night-two version of ""Miles Runs the Voodoo Down"" starts off as crackling uptempo funk. But following Shorter's solo, Corea and Holland engage in a free-form duel between bleepy keyboard and scratchy bowed bass that rivals Sun Ra's freakiest excursions. Here you can hear Corea-- who has gone on record saying he distrusted the electric piano when Miles first suggested he play it-- forgetting about technique and reveling in an alien sound palette.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The band isn't just about disruption. The versions of familiar pieces like ""Footprints"" and ""Round Midnight,"" both from from the first Antibes set, feature bashing DeJohnette crescendos and bracingly gritty Shorter solos, but they also demonstrate the band's knack for extraordinarily supple, dynamically controlled swing. A brief Miles/Corea duet on ""I Fall in Love Too Easily,"" from night two, is another shrewd pace-changer. On <i>The Bootleg Series, Volume 1</i>, Miles and Herbie Hancock introduce this same piece as an unaccompanied duo, but here, Corea's electric piano lends it a newly dreamlike aura. In retrospect, this interlude plays like a stealthy sneak preview of <i>In a Silent Way</i>'s proto-ambient brain massage; like the versions of Shorter's ""Sanctuary"" that close each Antibes set, it's part jazz balladry, part immersive soundscape.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The material on disc three, portions of two sets from November 5 in Stockholm, contrasts nicely with the fierce, sprawling Antibes shows. Because of an electric-piano malfunction, Corea plays acoustic piano for most of the first set, a swap that has a major effect on the group dynamic. This performance has its dark, unruly moments, including an early take on the ominous title track of <i>Bitches Brew</i>, recorded that past August but not yet released, but overall, it's a surprisingly tame outing. The version of Shorter's ""Nefertiti"" sounds both elegant and almost quaint, about as close as the Lost Quintet ever came to jazz orthodoxy. The one sample we get of the second Stockholm set offers a tantalizing contrast: a rare take on ""This"", a Corea composition which the pianist had first recorded in May of '69 with a band that included both Holland and DeJohnette. After a brief group theme statement-- with Corea back on electric piano-- the ensemble embarks on a series of atomized improvisations, including a dense Davis/DeJohnette face-off and a pointillist Shorter/Holland/DeJohnette excursion. This single track, possibly the most concentrated example on record of a Miles Davis group playing free jazz, demonstrates how the members of the Lost Quintet spurred the leader toward the avant-garde even as they helped him achieve a deeper engagement with funk and psychedelia. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The DVD, containing a complete Berlin concert from November 7, is essential; the clarity and intimacy of this pristine multicamera document should assure that no one ever again pegs this band as obscure. The in-progress shift in Miles' aesthetic, already apparent in the music, is right there to behold in the men's dress: Whereas the Second Great Quintet always turned up in black tie, the Lost Quintet looks like it's fresh from a Williamsburg vintage shop. (Holland's ensemble—a cow-skin-pattern vest over a purple sweatsuit—is either a facepalmer or a triumph, depending on your tastes.) The band takes a while to warm up here, turning in an unusually subdued ""Directions."" But by a mid-set ""It's About That Time,"" the feral magic is back; Shorter's brilliantly jittery, speaking-in-tongues soprano solo and a low-volume, high-intensity free-improv duet between Corea and a mallets-wielding DeJohnette make this piece one of the highlights of the entire box set.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Shorter, Corea, Holland and DeJohnette eventually left Miles' band in turn, and Davis began constructing the psych-funk juggernaut heard on records like 1974's aptly titled <i>Dark Magus</i>. As Miles outfitted his trumpet with a wah-wah effect, enlisted a phalanx of guitars and began doubling on organ, the atmosphere thickened and the grooves grew more colossal, but the trumpeter would never again lead a group as thrillingly virtuosic and diabolically mutable as the Lost Quintet. (It's a testament to Miles' eye for talent that Shorter, Corea, Holland and DeJohnette still rank among the most popular and esteemed jazz musicians on earth; Shorter's current working quartet, heard on the new Blue Note release <i>Without a Net</i>, exemplifies a volatility that's directly traceable to the Lost Quintet.) That fact is now duly noted in the official record, thanks to this set-- a bad motherfucker in its own right.</p></div>"|17676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17676-the-bootleg-series-volume-2-live-in-europe-1969/|9.0|Hank Shteamer

His voice sounds the way a good memory <i>feels</i>, warm, soft around the edges, lived in, and detailed enough to invite exploration for a while. But those qualities can become a liability for someone trying to live in the present; whenever the Clientele attempted to rock or sound contemporary, he sounded out of his element. With the Clientele on hiatus, his collaboration with Pipas' Lupe Nunez-Fernandez didn't exactly vouch for a change of scenery as the proper remedy; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29127-amor-de-dias/"" target=""_blank"">Amor de Días</a>' 2011 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15446-street-of-the-love-of-days/"" target=""_blank""><i>Street of the Love of Days</i></a>, preemptively mitigated expectations with its apologetic presentation, and still managed to underwhelm. Now with <i>The House at Sea </i>legitimizing Amor de Días as a proper band, its predecessor seems a necessary, awkward step in transition. Though <i>The House at Sea</i> still comes off like a travel brochure in audio form, this time MacLean and Nunez-Fernandez at least feel like the people in it rather than those looking at it.</p>
<p>It's a significant improvement on <i>Love of Days, </i>and almost all of it can be chalked up to commitment. Amor de Días' debut was more of a compilation, recorded ""in secret"" over three years with an open-ended personnel, flipping through 15 songs in various states of completion over its 42 minutes. <i>The House at Sea </i>is the result of nine days in the studio with a steady rhythm section, and each of its 12 songs feels finished and fussed over. While still mostly based in decidedly non-rock forms such as bossa nova and English and Spanish pastoral folk, the songs are considerably more defined-- certain parts even come close to <i>rocking</i>, such as Nunez-Fernandez's surprisingly fleet-footed ""Day"" and the frisky, nylon-guitar thrum powering ""In the Winter Sun"". Within this context, a three-chord British Invasion throwback (""Jean's Waving) that could fit on the Clientele's later, more extroverted records has an immediacy that sounds completely out of place on <i>The House at Sea</i>.</p>
<p>More typical are the magic hour lullabies in both native tongues (and even if you haven't taken Spanish since high school, you can follow ""Viento del Mar"" or ""Piedras Rotas"" fairly easily) and they're certainly lovely if not a little lyrically lightweight. And while MacLean has tried to slip spoken word into Clientele albums with varying degrees of success, ""The Sunlit Estate"" and ""Maureen"" are free-form pieces that function better within Amor de Días' looser artistic restrictions. Centerpiece ""Viento del Mar"" hinges on a bold major chord change, and, combined with a sinister, wandering bassline and Nunez-Fernandez's nearly subliminal vocals, it's basically a shoegaze song (something along the lines of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4751-serena-maneesh/"" target=""_blank"">Serena-Maneesh</a>) relieved of its distortion and reverb, at least until a coda of surprisingly doomy guitar soloing appears.</p>
<p>That said, even with the bolstered band interplay, every instrument feels like it's being massaged rather than strummed, plucked, or hit-- MacLean's voice barely gets above a whisper, Nunez-Fernandez repeats little more than the titles of ""Day"" and ""In The Winter Sun"" like she's breathing these compositions into life, and, whatever texture you might get from individual cymbal crashes or a guitar distortions, the whole eventually becomes as gritty as a white sand beach. <i>The House at Sea </i>was inspired by time spent in both London and Madrid, and most of the vocals are given to MacLean, but it's still more far more Mediterranean in pace and climate. For the most part, it's ""yacht rock"" in the sense that <i>The House at Sea </i>actually makes you feel like you're on a yacht (or catamaran) as opposed to imagining a coked-out, bearded millionaire in his studio.</p>
<p>Even if Amor de Días stands to become MacLean's main focus instead of a side project, he still gets to play the tourist, enviably relaxed and ultimately giving himself a break from the hard work. This inherently limits the overall effect: Clientele songs distinguished themselves from the scores of other nostalgists through their awareness of place, of seeing things a casual onlooker might not, or they found new ways to express the mundane. <i>The House at Sea </i>begins with a classic MacLean-ism (""The streets in June/ The silver moon/ Like paint on glass""), and from there onward, he's not an expert on his surroundings, just someone taking it all in. While the best work of the Clientele created worlds, <i>The House at Sea</i> charmingly aspires to being a photo album, something to inspire your own travels rather than serve as a substitute for them.<i> </i></p></div>"|17567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17567-the-house-at-sea/|6.8|Ian Cohen

They're loners with facial hair in frigid climates, but that's where the similarities stop: After a decade of being in go-nowhere bands, a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaaC2TKsXi8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube</a> of the 33-year-old Juul's ""Magic Kids"" started to circulate in part due to a video made with an iPhone camera and some artfully incorporated T&amp;A. It landed him a record deal with 4AD and, consequently, a mandate to actually make this record. In a roundabout way, Juul ends up justifying the comparisons, albeit to Justin Vernon's second album, as the sensationally evocative <i>Somewhere Else </i>similarly creates a world where boundaries between folk, piano balladry, arena rock, and post-rock dissolve, resulting in something both unclassifiable and wholly his.</p>
<p>Indians is now a band, which, from a logistical standpoint, will undoubtedly help Juul in a live setting, though what's interesting about <i>Something Else </i>is that so much of it appears to have been made with the intention of rendering a band unnecessary or at least superfluous. There's a sneaky inventiveness to the way he experiments with how much space one guy and his keyboard can fill.</p>
<p>As a result, the songs here are spare and could prove to be fertile remix material, but they're hardly minimal. ""Lips Lips Lips"" is dance music turned inside out, the pinging synth pattern used for percussive effect, whereas the steady bass drum feels more like a melodic undercurrent. Meanwhile, ""Bird"" and ""New"" reach for the rafters in a completely empty arena-- on the latter, Juul leans <i>hard </i>at the bridge into a melody that spirals perilously upward. At that point, you're conditioned to expect some sort of accompanying percussive bombast, cymbal crashes, kick drums, something: They're nowhere to be found and the momentum is generated solely by Juul's tart, impassioned vocals expanding within the reverb rather than hiding. It's not too far off what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a> did on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hurry Up, We're Dreaming</i></a>, but where the songs on that record are more like rockets, carefully calibrated, expensive and meant to impress the hell out of you, the songs of <i>Somewhere Else </i>are hot-air balloons, charmingly handmade and possessed of an element of the unknown; you're not sure how high these things are supposed to go.</p>
<p><i>Somewhere Else </i>is just as untethered even on the tracks that scan the most ""folk."" Juul taught himself guitar during the making of <i>Somewhere Else </i>and he fits it within his artistic M.O. by using a timid instrument aggressively-- ""Cakelakers"" and ""I Am Haunted"" fill the field with deep open chords and high-fretted fills while Juul's lyrics are at their most curiously despondent. On ""Cakelakers"", he writes an isolationist's love letter in creepy ESL (""Fun locked the doors/ The joy is on our side"") while on the latter, he sighs, ""girl, I am haunted,"" accompanied by off-kilter harmonies and surrounded by the unfolksy ambience of a whirring, warped sample of background noise.</p>
<p>As <i>Somewhere Else </i>progresses, it hints at the vision Juul might have for Indians as a bandleader as opposed to its sole contributor. The fairly standard drum machine rhythms of ""Reality Sublime"" and ""La Femme"" give the second half a nice bit of propulsion, though they reflect how ""New"" and ""Lips Lips Lips"" left more to the imagination. The same goes for the arresting ""Magic Kids"", which bears the understood qualities of ""sad"" music without being overly pushy about it; Juul's vocal melody descends to finish the line, ""I like to see your eyes/ But your eyes do not see any longer,"" and the melancholy feels deep-seated, understood on an emotional level rather than a verbal one, though it works on both.</p>
<p>It's highly unlikely anyone would immediately single it out as Juul's ""breakout hit,"" but it does demonstrate the most impressive aspect of <i>Somewhere Else</i>;<i> </i>how it can remain open to interpretation without ever sounding vague. Juul's vocals and production are emotive and permeable, always trying to convey something without any sort of coercion as to what that feeling's supposed to be. Fittingly, the first words you hear are, ""What is left for us to do/ Is to see the worlds as new."" The last: ""You are somewhere else.""</p></div>"|17568.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17568-somewhere-else/|7.6|Ian Cohen

Things clicked, and Green and Shapiro wisely decided to develop the fortuitous outing into this full-fledged debut album. Their respective backgrounds-- the salt-stung breeze of Little Joy, the Peaches' bizarro anti-folk, Green's solo singer-songwriter rock pastiche-- make <i>Adam Green &amp; Binki Shapiro</i> a likely invocation of the legacies left by Lee and Nancy, Richard and Linda, Gram and Emmylou. It's safe to say that the sweet, simple luxuries of romantic 1960s pop will forever more be mined in some capacity, making the line between flattery and forgery a very fine one.</p>
<p>Usually these kind of cheerful, laidback one-offs never amount to much more than just that, not heeding the possibility of becoming either baldly derivative or enamel-strippingly saccharine (or both). Green and Shapiro clearly understand that the broad appeal of love songs set in an almost universally beloved style doesn't work unless the songs themselves are clever, genuine, and a little tongue-in-cheek. And <i>Adam Green &amp; Binki Shapiro</i> is all of that, with two people playing to their strengths to make music that's intimate and dexterous in its ability to quietly coax out relatable emotions. They shared their ideas as guitar ditties, but Green and Shapiro headed in a slightly more ambitious direction in the studio, taking the time to give these songs their proper due with crisp production and subtle but inventive arrangements, elevating what could have been just another ho-hum collection of hummers and strummers.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the songs on the record are good enough to make it seem as if their day jobs are being spun off from the cozy little nucleus they've created here, rather than the other way around. This kind of connection suggests more than just a creative collaboration, and despite the fact that the two apparently don't share a romantic tie, it's largely beside the point. Instead, Green and Shapiro come off as two kindred spirits with similar relationship experiences, like two people just meeting whose old stories miraculously become new again. Inversely, they also seem like two people who've known each other for ages, who share their morning coffee and newspaper while listening to albums like this one. As Shapiro mentioned in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE0OPbIblKs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview</a>, ""It's kind of like reading your diary out loud to somebody."" It's lucky that she gave Green the key to it.</p>
<p>These aren't songs meant to jump out at you, but spend some time with them and little illuminations flicker to life. Songs like ""Casanova"" find Shapiro trying to reconcile the past of a current lover (""Forgive my ugliness should I find out/ Something that I don't wan't to know about""), playing a ""Casanova to the mentally ill,"" which is wryly funny if you're casually familiar with even a tenth of Green's music. Later, she finds herself pining for the attention of an older man on ""If You Want Me To"", sweetly and strangely heading-off all the implied ickiness that comes with the emotional and sexual inexperience of such an endeavor. Best of all are the closing two tracks, the darkly pretty ""The Nighttime Stopped Bleeding"", and the album's best song, ""Don't Ask for More"", which tenderly invokes Cocteau's <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>.</p>
<p>Yet as good as Green and Shapiro are as foils-- between her vocals <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12412-little-joy/"" target=""_blank"">once described here</a> as being ""like summer wine"" and his urban cowboy baritone-- it's really Shapiro's show: All the aforementioned songs feature only Shapiro's voice, save for ""Nighttime"". And it makes sense: Underutilized in Little Joy, she has the rare ability to hold your attention without doing much at all; she sounds precious, but not in the pejorative sense. <i>Adam Green &amp; Binki Shapiro</i> is short and to the point, with the anticipation of another go around sometime in the near future enough to keep them in your thoughts. And before you know it, you're finding yourself wishing they'd just knock off the goddamn charade and kiss already.</p></div>"|17599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17599-adam-green-binki-shapiro/|6.7|Zach Kelly

She's actually part of the same production family as Icona Pop, but as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30376-elliphant/"" target=""_blank"">Elliphant</a>, she frays Scandinavian pop precision at the edges to join up to a more global patchwork that runs from Mad Decent affiliates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28165-maluca/"" target=""_blank"">Maluca</a> to the junkheap magpie nest of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27665-staff-benda-bilili/"" target=""_blank"">Staff Benda Bilili</a>.</p>
<p>Although it's the wry, robotic strands of Scandinavian pop that tend to find traction outside of the region, reggae remains a popular idiom at home; in Olovsdotter's neighboring Denmark, there's a burgeoning Jamaican-influenced dance scene called, wonderfully, ""danskhall."" The <i>Elliphant</i> EP's sound draws on the rootsy bounce and clatter of those genres, and is undeniably the product of dance music post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"" target=""_blank"">Diplo</a>, riding the fizzing pulse of moombahton. So far, so music without borders. But across the EP, Olovsdotter chants and taunts and teases in a perfect approximation of a genre-appropriate brogue that works well until you uneasily reconcile it with the fact that she's a Caucasian former model.</p>
<p>Most of the lyrics read relatively coherently on paper, but on <i>Elliphant</i>, the accented inflection makes Olovsdotter sound as though she's singing in a pidgin singjaying style: ""Busy bee bum bumbely/ We suck this juice,"" she rattles off on her calling card, the Jungle and Tommy Tysper-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13481-tekkno-scene-ft-adam-kanyama/"" target=""_blank"">""TeKKno Scene""</a>, as firework synths screech with total indolence. ""Hunt a dragon/ Jump her back an' feel the youth/ Youth is a drippen from the clothes/ Ya huh!"" On one hand, it's a nod to the pan-global dance culture that inspired her in the first place; on the other, it feels a bit iffy. Though on her guest spot later in that song, rapper Adam Kanyama gets to the danger of assuming that the people and art of a certain culture are a single monolithic entity: ""I'm okay/ Just don't touch my hair/ A place called everywhere/ World, you dare? … Everybody, every person has an answer/ So when they ask if I'm cussin' with the next black person too/ Tell 'em, fuck you.""</p>
<p>The most sympathetic reading of the lyrics is that their incomprehensibility conjures the immersive, chattering incoherence of a really, blurrily good night out. If there's one thing that Olovsdotter does impeccably, it's provide the raw goods for one of those. The Tommy Tysper-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13837-cant-hear-it/"" target=""_blank"">""Cian't Hear It""</a> swaggers in on a menacing bass bounce, a synth yapping like a dog straining against a fire hydrant tether. Olovsdotter kicks off her part with a lower jaw-jutting sneer before rolling out a few idiosyncratic turns of phrase: ""Swimmin' in a freaking sea of shitsponsibilities,"" she sings, before demanding, ""Sit there again/ I'm like a finger up your ass now/ Why not give it to me?"" ""When you first hear that line, you feel, 'Ok, this girl is really annoying,' but actually, a finger up the ass could be very nice. It's really nice to have me up your ass,"" Olovsdotter said an <a href=""http://oohbrilliant.tumblr.com/image/20966554396"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, neatly encapsulating the kind of joyful agitation she's going for as Elliphant.</p>
<p>""Cian't Hear It"" is a good primer for Olovsdotter's dancefloor, though producer Jungle provides the more intense cuts; ""Make it Juicy"" ups the stakes with its artillery of carnal grunts, stuttering bass, and crude, screaming firecracker synths, coming off like a beat for one of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1330-missy-elliott/"" target=""_blank"">Missy Elliott</a>'s turn-of-the-century records. She sounds like a scorned M.I.A. on the verses, before a cabal of dastardly, persuasive female voices surround her on the chorus: ""Come on, come on, come on,"" she ticks off impatiently, as if there were better evil she could be wreaking elsewhere. ""Make it <i>joooooozy</i>,"" the gang of voices insist. Swedish rapper Eboi takes a verse towards the end, sounding utterly intimidated and harried by the situation he's wandered in on-- ""Place full of animals/ All of you/ Some girl's fucked up/ I don't know what pills""-- which only serves to make Olovsdotter and co sound even more terrifyingly dominant. It breaks into the crude grind and chime of ""In the Jungle"", which bursts like being spat from a club out onto a dazzling, electric carnival-bright metropolis street, the beat as insistent as ""Edge of Seventeen"" dressed up as a cheap banger in fluoro rave gear and facepaint.</p>
<p>The opening track strays furthest from the agitated blend of digital and rudimentary sounds that make up <i>Elliphant</i>, and it's the most traditionally constructed <i>song</i>-song here: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14595-down-on-life/"" target=""_blank"">""Down on Life""</a> is a panoramic, lurching beast whose verses billow as if rising to a murky surface on massive bubbles, and Olovsdotter sings as if she were a depressed android: ""I could use a break/ Me need to go/ Down, down, down, down on life/ I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight."" Shove baggage in a bin-bag, and <i>Elliphant</i> has the potential to take you further than that.</p></div>"|17695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17695-elliphant-ep/|7.4|Laura Snapes

In the spring of 1964, 17-year old <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1442-marianne-faithfull/"" target=""_blank"">Marianne Faithfull</a> walked into a swinging, star-studded London party and landed a record deal without singing a note; Andrew Loog Oldham, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"" target=""_blank"">Rolling Stones</a> manager and world-class sleazeball, famously summed up the matter with his usual showbiz aplomb: ""I saw an angel with big tits and signed her."" Within the year, the bookish baroness' daughter was climbing the charts and making the rounds at concert halls and the BBC, thrust into a pop career she didn't much want in the first place. (""For one brief, blissful moment I thought I saw a way out of my pop nightmare,"" she wrote three decades later in her autobiography, <i>Faithfull</i>, which is every bit as insightful, vivid, and deliciously bonkers as Keith Richards' <i>Life</i>.) Faithfull was a passable vocalist with a folksy, melancholy, relatively generic lilt, but there was a certain vacancy and listlessness about her that suggested she'd not yet become comfortable in her skin. If you watch some of her <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhPPJ5dolxU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">earliest performances</a> on YouTube, she has a way of making Lana Del Rey look present.</p>
<p>Faithfull started dating Mick Jagger in 1966, and her 60s output is generally only discussed in terms of how it relates to that of the Stones: ""As Tears Go By"" is more famous for being the first song Mick and Keith wrote together than for being Faithfull's debut single. On the personal front, though, the opposite was true: Notoriety had a way of sliding off the boys and sticking to Faithfull. After the infamous Redlands drug bust, the press dubbed her ""Miss X"" and, a bit more personably, ""The Girl in the Fur Rug."" (""SCANTILY CLAD WOMAN AT DRUG PARTY"" screamed one representative headline.) To those closer to the Stones' circle, she was The Muse-- though by her account, her relationship with Jagger was a pretty mutual exchange of ideas, old records, and hallucinogens. Ever the avid reader, a little while prior to the <i>Beggar's Banquet</i> sessions, Faithfull handed him<i> The Master and Margarita </i>and suggested that this Lucifer guy might make for a good character in a song. She wrote the lyrics to ""Sister Morphine"", and cut a shudderingly melancholy version that makes the Stones' take almost seem like a romp. This was maybe the first big, public hint that Miss X knew more about pain and suffering than a lot of people wanted to assume. When she slipped into the coma that almost killed her-- the result of taking 150 Tuinals in a hotel room in Australia-- she had a vision that Brian Jones, just six days in the ground, was beckoning her over a cliff. He leapt; at the last minute she decided to stay. When she opened her eyes in a hospital room six days later, Mick said, ""Marianne, we thought we'd lost you."" In that milky voice that was already starting to curdle, the first thing she said to him was, ""Wild horses couldn't drag me away.""</p>
<p>That's the thing about pretty faces. We'd much prefer to watch them wilt. We don't expect them to belong to the fighters-- the junkies and monks and cockroaches who'll survive every atomic bomb and suicide attempt and outlive us all. And we definitely don't expect them to make songs as gnarled and candid as the ones on Faithfull's finest record, <i>Broken English</i>, but there you go: the best records are all, in some way or another, the ones that blow a mouthful of smoke in the face of expectation. The world that thought it had tsk-tsked Miss X into submission was probably not ready for <i>Broken English</i> in 1979, and even today as it's released in a deluxe edition, it's still raw enough to make you squirm-- the cracked, undead voice of a woman back from exile to make a record about the simple audacity of staying alive.</p>
<p>If you know one thing about <i>Broken English</i>, you probably know that Faithfull was living on the streets right before she made it. And unlike the Mars Bar myth (now thoroughly <a href=""http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/marsbar.asp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">debunked</a> by Faithfull, Keith Richards, <i>and</i> an honest-to-goodness policeman), this checks out. Broke, heroin-dependent, and (it seemed) professionally washed up, Faithfull spent the better part of two years living in a roofless pile of rubble in Soho, a bombed-out ruin of the Blitz. She was squatting with her then-husband Ben Brierley (of British punks the Vibrators) and riding the unexpected success of her forlorn ballad, ""Dreamin' My Dreams"" (a dud at home but a surprise hit in politically tumultuous Ireland, where, in 1976, ""forlorn"" was the mood of the hour) when somebody at her label rather improbably gave her the money to cut another record.</p>
<p>The resulting album feels so intimate and personal that it's easy to overstate its singularity. But <i>Broken English</i> is more than just a portrait of the addict as a middle-aged woman; it captures an entire generation's disillusioned comedown. ""The days of mind-opening drugs were over,"" Faithfull writes in her autobiography, reflecting on the spiritual climate of the mid-70s. ""The world had tilted. A major change in key had taken place. It was a Mahler symphony whirling madly out of control."" And that's the key in which these songs were written and recorded. Much in the way the Stones did in the late 60s, <i>Broken English</i> taps into a collective consciousness. The new-wave-tinged title track evokes the anxious, prickling paranoia of the Cold War, a chillingly grim cover of ""Working Class Hero"" longs for the counterculture's idealistic faith in individuality, and the excellent ""Brain Drain"" (""Got so much to offer/ But I can't pay the rent/ I can't buy you roses 'cause the money's all spent"") captures the hopelessness of the junkie's lifestyle. A rapidly deteriorating Tim Hardin co-wrote the lyrics on that last one with Faithfull and Brierley on a debauched trip to Antigua. Both implicitly and explicitly, it's a ballad of wasted genius. It's one of the last songs to bear Hardin's name-- he was dead of an overdose a little over a year after the record came out.</p>
<p>After dabbling in baroque pop and country, Faithfull drew fresh inspiration from the Sex Pistols and Brierley's clan in the late 70s, but <i>Broken English</i> is a punk record more in spirit than in sound. (It doesn't sound much like any of her subsequent records either; afterwards, she moved towards the Weill-meets-Tom-Waits-in-a-dank-cabaret sound of the excellent <i>Strange Weather</i>.) Stylistically, <i>Broken English</i> is a fusion of new wave, blues, reggae, and pop, created by a backing band talented enough to genre-hop deftly. Guitarist Barry Reynolds adds a particularly distinct flair to the record; on the incendiary ""Why  D'ya Do It"", his barbed, sneering riff is the perfect match for Faithfull's legendary performance. Easily one of the best songs in her repertoire, ""Why  D'ya Do It"" is also probably the most controversial-- a Heathcote Williams-penned, unfiltered torrent of lovers' rage scattered liberally but purposefully with a few words that still have the power to shock.</p>
<p><i>Broken English</i>'s most affecting moment is Faithfull's spellbinding rendition of Shel Silverstein's ""The Ballad of Lucy Jordan"", a song about a bored housewife dreaming of the exhilarating life and ""thousand lovers"" she never had, slowly going mad. Obviously, it's far from autobiography, but when you know Faithfull's history (a veritable primer on the pitfalls of an exhilarating life), the subtext becomes almost unbearably poignant. ""Lucy Jordan is me if my life had take a different turn,"" she has <a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7mLhnEEXD9AC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=%22Lucy+Jordan+is+me+if+my+life+had+taken+a+different+turn,%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UKr5dOKoFB&amp;sig=PP69iGBPFTUUuU79L4tCUr7HPT4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=99IHUf7KNs6R0QWLoYD4Aw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lucy%20Jordan%20is%20me%20if%20my%20life%20had%20taken%20a%20different%20turn%2C%22&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. ""It's a song of identification with women who are trapped in that life and the true private horror of the 'good life.'"" But the pain in her fractured voice tells a more complicated story, pointing towards the classic catch-22 that still plagues famous and unfamous women alike: The world will size you up and make you choose one of two roles, Miss X or Lucy Jordan. And the worst of it, Faithfull is saying in this evocative performance, is that the dreamy conjectures about what your life would have been had you chosen differently will not only prove incessant, they might actually drive you crazy.</p>
<p>The bonus material on this deluxe edition of <i>Broken English</i> doesn't add too much to the experience. With only one exception (""Sister Morphine""), the extra disc is all alternate mixes and extended cuts of the songs that made the record. If anything, the remixes' noodly accoutrements will make you appreciate the record's purposeful minimalism anew. In almost every case, wisely, producer Mark Miller Mundy and engineer Bob Potter let the unvarnished power of Faithfull's voice carry these songs. The deluxe edition also includes the great experimental filmmaker Derek Jarman's early music videos for ""Broken English"", ""Witches Song"", and ""Lucy Jordan"", but if you can make peace with the low quality you could have watched these on YouTube years ago. This particular re-release of <i>Broken English</i> isn't notable because of any new insight it brings to the listening experience, but for the simple fact that it might bring some new fans to an enduringly great record.</p>
<p>Faithfull has been clean for a while now, but she still speaks freely and unapologetically about the experiences that lead her to making this record. Last week I was listening to an <a href=""http://worldradio.ch/wrs/shows/mix/an-icon-in-switzerland-marianne-faithfull.shtml?16713"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with her that I assumed was current, done in promotion of the deluxe edition. I didn't realize it was a few years old until she started talking about Amy Winehouse hopefully and in the present tense. ""She's young, she's rich, she feels absolutely immortal,"" Faithfull said, with obvious empathy. ""They judge her [harshly]... but she's going to get through it all, I know it."" Feeling a little haunted after hearing this, I put on <i>Broken English</i> immediately, and its sheer power and purpose had never felt more obvious. This record documents a particular shade of darkness not everybody lives to describe. Like Faithfull identifying with her opposite in Lucy Jordan, <i>Broken English</i> is an almost otherworldly communion with the other side; it's a record for the Joneses and the Hardins and the Winehouses and all the other voices that the wild horses dragged away before they could say anything this honest about their pain. Aching and defiantly alive, it still bleeds like it was cut yesterday.</p></div>"|17565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17565-broken-english-deluxe-edition/|8.7|Lindsay Zoladz

After that, the ""for old times sake"" itch was probably scratched for most people, but GBV went ahead anyway and put out two more classically overstuffed LPs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16740-class-clown-spots-a-ufo/"" target=""_blank""><i>Class Clown Spots a UFO</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17321-the-bears-for-lunch/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Bears for Lunch</i></a>. Now comes a new EP, <i>Down by the Racetrack</i>, ahead of <i>another</i> LP, <i>English Little League</i>, due later this year.</p>
<p>Robert Pollard releases a shit-load of albums every year-- what else is new? For one thing, this version of GBV was and is a real band, not just backing musicians dotting the galaxy of Pollard's solo projects. The distinction matters: GBV's 2012 trilogy looked and felt like the albums churned out by this line-up in the mid-90s-- albeit with a slightly worse batting average-- with a wealth of spontaneously produced gems and freeform noisy weirdness. This has long been Pollard's formula, though the racket kicked up on those records unmistakably belongs to this specific set of musicians, and not just because there's a Tobin Sprout vocal on every fifth track. (Though that's a big help.) GBV's recent output has an underappreciated craft and logic to it: Even the draggy, thinking-out-loud dead spots suddenly snap into coherence after three listens in ways Pollard's solo work often doesn't.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with Guided by Voices' vast discography knows what to expect from <i>Down by the Racetrack</i> before hearing it: EPs have been a familiar oasis for GBV in the months (or weeks) that stretch between albums, providing a forum for songs that are too bizarre or extemporaneous even by this band's shaggy-dog standards. And <i>Down by the Racetrack </i>pretty much <i>is </i>that. ""It Travels Faster Through Thin Hair"" is one of those Robert Pollard compositions that sounds like it was written two minutes before they hit the ""record"" button. Pollard's vocal and guitar spend a good 20 seconds trying to find a melody, but once a twangy guitar materializes to act as a guide, he's magically unearthed it, if only for another 20 seconds. ""Pictures of the Man"" sets an atonal <i>154 </i>guitar riff and ghostly monk chants on a bloody collision course. ""Standing in a Puddle of Flesh"" is the mandated-by-GBV-law <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23101-genesis/"" target=""_blank"">Genesis</a> tribute, though the perverse piano riff calls back to ""Always Crush Me"" from <i>Alien Lanes. </i>The title track is the closest thing <i>Racetrack </i>has to a ""Shocker in Gloomtown"" or ""Dusted"", with its magnificent glam-rock riff and Sprout's uncharacteristically commanding vocal.</p>
<p>By virtue of being an EP arriving in the midst of so many other GBV releases, <i>Down by the Racetrack </i>is likely to be overlooked. But for anyone curious about the viability of GBV's revived recording career and unsure of where to begin, <i>Racetrack </i>arguably offers the best introduction. GBV is clearly past the the ""cash-in"" portion of its reunion; <i>Racetrack, </i>like the other recent releases, showcases a band that has fully re-connected with its binge-and-purge creative process, and is back to producing found-object pop and hook-laden doodles at a prodigious clip. <i>Racetrack</i> has all of the mess, melody, magic, and mania of the other records, but in a smaller, more bite-sized, but nonetheless pleasingly indulgent package.</p></div>"|17555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17555-down-by-the-racetrack-ep/|7.0|Steven Hyden

These are reasonable questions. Spit, real name Alexander Manzano, is a subterranean sort, and the world hasn't been given many chances to know him. A gaunt, intense, hermetic 25-year old Filipino kid operating on the fringes of the L.A. hip-hop scene, he raps in a pneumatic, plugged-up bleat, and his self-produced music feels emitted from somewhere dank and lightless-- not L.A, in other words, nor the intensely communal North Bay Area in which he was originally raised.<i> A Breathtaking Trip</i> is his first commercial release, and its a curious mixture of West Coast rap signifiers and bad drugs horror core impulses: ""This ain't that Acura, this the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqQuihD0hoI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dragula</a>"", he raps on ""Ride"". In other words: He rides, just like any other California rap citizen, he just chooses to do so in <a href=""http://www.gifsoup.com/view/2427967/rob-zombie-dragula.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Rob Zombie-piloted dune buggy.</a> His rap name, maybe the most unimaginatively descriptive handle since Black Rob, is the least inspired thing about him.</p>
<p>What immediately separates Spit's first official release from the legions of self-styled outsider auteurs rapping to themselves on Bandcamp is his touch as a producer. <i>A Breathtaking Trip</i> is a sullen, antisocial record, but Spit makes being a loner feel like a positively sensual experience. His bleak, smeary sound draws from the murkier corners of the L.A. beat scene-- it's easy to imagine him rapping over a track by, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27935-nosaj-thing/"" target=""_blank"">Nosaj Thing</a>-- and the dour gloom of London bass. If there is any connection to Bay Area rap sounds, they poke through submerged: The clicks and pops of ""Death by 27"" sound more at home next to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"" target=""_blank"">Autechre</a> than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"" target=""_blank"">E-40</a>, but miles above the track's bottom end, a ghost of a G-funk synth floats. ""Coastal/Hyperion"" bumps like vintage <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4883-dj-quik/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Quik</a> until the synths start glowing like alien spores.</p>
<p><i>Breathtaking Trip</i> is an immersive listen with lots of small details like this waiting to be noticed. Experienced through a fat pair of headphones, it feels like dunking your head into a dark barrel of water. The stuttering drum roll of ""That's Spit / Space Echoes"" disappears into vapors and traces with nothing but a cavernous, watery dub pulse marking time. ""Artesia"" feeds a house diva vocal snippet through a Cuisinart. Spit often treats his vocals with Witness Protection Program-style processing that might remind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29238-odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a> fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"" target=""_blank"">Tyler, the Creator</a>, but his thick double-time flow, sunk all the way to the ocean floor of the mix, recalls Houston depressive, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5556-trae/"" target=""_blank"">Trae</a>.</p>
<p>Like a lot of rap's tenacious outsiders, Spit takes a few moments to telegraph his outsized love of the culture: ""I used to freestyle for hours on my way home/ My first beats, they were dialed in on a pay phone,"" he raps on ""GREAT SCOTT!!!"". His most compelling lyrics are druggier and less concrete, though, flashing in on a striking, retina-singeing image: ""Skyline look like my name in cursive while I'm getting brain,"" he raps on ""Pulp 2013/Heroin Chic"", while on ""Black Magic on Blue Magic"", he imagines ""clear skies without chemtrails"" and ""skylines without drones.""</p>
<p>Still, Spit's writing doesn't always measure up to the hallucinatory atmosphere of his music-- some of his lines fall flat (""Peep my catalogue, my bars got that glory""). When he enlists some higher-profile guests-- E-40 and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29952-mr-muthafuckin-exquire/"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Muthafuckin' Exquire</a> on ""B.N.E.,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a>, playing Russian Roulette, eating sturgeon, and bumping Oakland veteran Joe Blow on ""Artesia""-- they pull too much spotlight too easily. But <i>A Breathtaking Trip to That Otherside</i> is Spit's first full release, and it hints at some great things. A new weirdo is never unwelcome in rap.</p></div>"|17637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17637-a-breathtaking-trip-to-that-otherside/|7.2|Jayson Greene

Since 2009, the band has remained blissfully off-grid, recording hundreds of songs over several tapes and full-lengths for similarly homegrown labels like <a href=""http://thespookytown.blogspot.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spooky Town Artifacts</a>, <a href=""http://www.feedingtuberecords.com/Feedingtuberecords.com/WELCOME_TO_FEEDING_TUBE_RECORDS.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Feeding Tube</a>, and <a href=""http://raccoo-oo-oon.org/np/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Night People</a>, which makes their next release feel like a move into the spotlight: it's being recorded with Jarvis Taverniere of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"" target=""_blank"">Woods</a>, and is set for release on Mexican Summer later this year. For context, the label is prepping for the forthcoming LP with this retrospective compilation, which might seem premature if the songs weren't so strong.</p>
<p>The collection opens with ""Now Everybody Rock Like You Got AIDS"", a track from their 2009 album <i>Family Matters</i>-- one of two 40-track cassettes they released that year. The song is an explosive, excessively distorted shout-along that brings to mind the blown-out sound of <a href=""http://www.siltbreeze.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Siltbreeze</a> acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5176-times-new-viking/"" target=""_blank"">Times New Viking</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19359-eat-skull/"" target=""_blank"">Eat Skull</a>, or the proudly out-of-tune punk rock of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1874-half-japanese/"" target=""_blank"">Half Japanese</a>. But unlike those bands, Happy Jawbone's members sing with more of a whimsical, childlike disposition, an eerie aesthetic given the title and the chorus. It works as an introduction to the way their songs often juxtapose youthful innocence with dark realities of life and death (according to the band, it was written while members were studying at Naropa University's Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics and alludes to how ""the ghosts of that epidemic walk freely around the campus""). Continuing the thread is""Fireflies Made Out of Dust"", a crackly, off-kilter gem that sounds like each player is learning the song as they go along, screeching the blues in childish voices: ""You drew an airplane flying through my head/ I might as well be dead.""</p>
<p>The world of Happy Jawbone is shaded by absurdist comedy, especially in the way their songs are are so self-referential, recycling and re-contextualizing their own lyrics, melodies, song titles, and motifs from record to record: fires, broken glass, butter, and bugs, particularly fireflies, are all popular song topics. Halfway through <i>Family Matters</i>, there's a wacky aside in ""The Album So Far..."", which takes the first half of the tape and compacts it into the length of a single track; to date, they've recorded three variations on ""At the Hotel Double Tragedy""-- the version here sounds cartoonish and toy-like.</p>
<p>Happy Jawbone's disturbed take on whimsy and rebellious, youthful spirit recalls lo-fi stables, Elephant 6 and K Records: The alien-sounding ""Martian Santa"" comes from a Christmas album they released in 2011, and brings to mind the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2876-the-music-tapes/"" target=""_blank"">the Music Tapes</a> treat holiday tunes; the record's final song, the six-minute ""Don't Tread on the Museums of Your Youth"", reads like a poetic distillation of all this band's complex ways of dealing with nostalgia and childhood. But Happy Jawbone have their own thing going on, thanks all the same: Like Olympia, Brattleboro is a small town where a regional sound and tiny but fruitful community of experimenters (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30550-blanche-blanche-blanche/"" target=""_blank"">Blanche Blanche Blanche</a>, the Great Valley, Chris Weisman) exist outside of the big city glare and sheen. On <i>Tastes the Broom</i>, Happy Jawbone Family Band celebrate the value of lo-fi as an act of direct resistance to the toxic gloss of professionalism, making a persuasive statement in defense of wide-eyed amateurism in the process.</p></div>"|17655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17655-tastes-the-broom/|7.6|Liz Pelly

For music that thrives on subtlety and nuance, too many cooks in the kitchen can often muddle what otherwise requires just clarity and finesse. So it's with skepticism that we approach Brooklyn's Bryce Hackford and Frank Lyon, who record little assemblages of synthesizer, field recordings, and loops, almost all of questionable fidelity, as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30906-pearl-necklace/"" target=""_blank"">Pearl Necklace</a>. After hearing the pair's music, Alexis Georgopoulos (better know as electronic composer, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28087-arp"">Arp</a>) linked the pair up with the revered Norwegian label, <a href=""http://www.smalltownsupersound.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smalltown Supersound</a>. He shows up on almost half of the songs on Pearl Necklace's debut LP, <i>Soft Opening</i>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt"" target=""_blank"">MGMT</a> vocalist Andrew VanWyngarden drops in on organ for the record's closing track. It's clear that Pearl Necklace aren't particularly interested in playing by the rules, instead opting to pick and choose from samples ranging from obscure and murky to spin-drunk to nearly invisible. Weirdly enough, <i>Soft Opening</i> maintains a sort of oddball consistency in this regard, but is ultimately so aimless, messy, and at times beyond tedious, it hardly matters how many hands were in its pot.</p>
<p><i>Soft Opening</i>'s sketch-like quality practically writes its own ""How many unfathomably stoned 20-somethings does it take to screw in an MPC?"" joke. The eyelid movies Pearl Necklace are trying to conjure may certainly be stranger than any lifeless cinematic fare you're likely to enjoy in the next month, but they often register just as flat and lazily conceived. It quickly becomes apparent that <i>Soft Opening</i> was recorded over the span of a very ""relaxed"" year: These quirky, disjointed little blueprints often begin in the middle of nowhere and end up right back where they started, their heavy reliance on a smattering of barely-there samples fostering an organic vibe, yet certainly not one of this planet. ""Why Toto?"" uses bleary synth stabs like a repurposing of the first contact in <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>, had said aliens been seriously wasted and spilled space beer into the PA system. Moments like these might clue you into a sense of humor itching under <i>Soft Opening</i>'s skin (though coming from a band called Pearl Necklace, humor is kind of relative), but its foggy construction and dawdling pace just points you back in the direction of weird for weirdness' sake.</p>
<p>If Pearl Necklace are aping any weirdos here, they've made a few wise choices. The fluorescent nacho cheese smear of ""Radio Love"" sounds reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a>, while a handful of tracks owe a good deal to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28951-sun-araw/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Araw</a>. With a bit more time, care, and ambition, portions of <i>Soft Opening</i> could have really come to life. ""Doorbell"" has a definable <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wMoPSsn2-8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zissou-like charm</a>, but is marred by a mess of clattering distractions that don't afford the song any sort of rhythmic or textural favors. There's a similar likability at work in the groove-forward ""Ah Ah"", but instead of wriggling its way into your brain as intended, the foundationless repetition begins to feel like water torture. These songs hint at a necessary tension, but more often than not, the defining details come off as obstructions.</p>
<p>There's great potential appeal in how shaded and cheekily unaware of themselves these songs are, however. If Arp has inspired anything in these two newcomers, it's the idea that you can still say a great deal using only the simplest of terms. What he forgot to convey was that simple doesn't have to mean half-hearted or uninvested, which is the nagging problem at <i>Soft Opening</i>'s center. Maybe Pearl Necklace is slowly defining its own set of motions, but it's hard to deny that they're not just going through them here. As on ""Pearlfriend"", which sounds like a dispatch from the world's loneliest echo-locator, Pearl Necklace are never far from finding something interesting as a result of their machines' unreliable wirings. But what <i>Soft Opening</i> could really benefit from is a good old fashioned jump start.</p></div>"|17600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17600-soft-opening/|5.6|Zach Kelly

The first two Ducktails LPs were cozy, blithely executed indie rock comfort food that occasionally coalesced into semi-structured songs. With 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14960-ducktails-iii-arcade-dynamics/"" target=""_blank"">Ducktails III: Arcade Dynamics</a>, </i>Mondanile tightened up and offered a tuneful (but still slight) precursor to the sublime guitar pop of Real Estate's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15918-days/"" target=""_blank""><i>Days</i></a>. <i>The Flower Lane </i>is the latest progression for what now resembles a fully fledged group. Mondanile's hasn't tempered the echoes of his other band in Ducktails, but he isn't confined to Real Estate's shadow, either.</p>
<p>The presence of New Jersey power-poppers and Real Estate tourmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28375-big-troubles/"" target=""_blank"">Big Troubles</a> helps to give the record a wider musical vocabulary than Mondanile's previous (and mostly solo) Ducktails efforts. After the <i>Days</i>-like cathedral of luminously chiming guitars that heralds the opening track ""Ivy Covered House,"" Mondanile settles into a warmly melancholy vein of jazzy, fractured pop songs. At times, it's as if he's paying homage to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kaputt </i></a>and that record's gauche elegance: The soft-rock keyboard accents and head-swimming horns of ""Under Cover"" represent a level of musical sophistication that Mondanile hasn't attempted before on a Ducktails record. The title tracks cuts the blurry, VHS tape-quality of past Ducktails efforts with a rainy day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3941-steely-dan/"" target=""_blank"">Steely Dan</a> electric piano lick that clarifies and underlines the song's gently serrated hook. The lysergic pop of ""Timothy Shy"" culminates with a fiery guitar solo that burns through Mondanile's normally narcotized façade. Taken together, these subtle yet unmistakable upgrades to Ducktails' gauzy instrumentation immediately command attention, where the records before <i>The Flower Lane </i>were content to lay indifferently outside of it.</p>
<p>Some of the best moments on <i>The Flower Lane </i>occur when Mondanile steps aside and plays musical director for his cast of guest stars. He's especially deft at utilizing female voices, which offer a colorful contrast to his flat, expressionless murmur. ""Sedan Magic"" stumbles over an erratic R&amp;B rhythm on the Mondanile-sung verses, and then zooms to the stratosphere whenever Madeline Follin of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28665-cults/"" target=""_blank"">Cults</a> takes over on the grabby chorus. Mondanile hands the album's best track, the dreamy love song, ""Letter of Intent"", to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29380-future-shuttle/"" target=""_blank"">Future Shuttle</a>'s Jessa Farkas and Big Troubles' Ian Drennan, and the result is a sexy, shy-eyed snuggle jam aided by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>'s Daniel Lopatin on synths and his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"" target=""_blank"">Ford &amp; Lopatin</a> collaborator Joel Ford on bass.</p>
<p>The relatively sumptuous presentation of <i>The Flower Lane </i>successfully separates it from the rest of Ducktails' discography. Unfortunately, a familiar emptiness remains. With <i>Days</i>, Real Estate mined a potent strain of nostalgic ache, giving the songs an emotional thoroughfare that tied the record together into a unified statement. <i>The Flower Lane </i>approaches the musical eloquence of <i>Days</i>, but Mondanile's mind and his soul still don't seem to be in the same place.</p>
<p>Get past the beauty of these songs and what's left is a frustrating lack of substantive sentiment: The gurgly funk of ""Assistant Director"" and the glistening, electro-folk ballad ""Academy Avenue"" speak to Mondanile's ability to churn out easily chewable ear candy. But nothing here lingers, and after a while Mondanile's attachment to the pleasantly ephemeral starts to feel like a dodge. The only lyric that sticks, tellingly, comes from of a cover of Peter Gutteridge's ""Planet Phrom"": ""I'm moving in a haze all day and I've got a cloudy mind."" Mondanile has cleared his mind on <i>The Flower Lane</i>; now he just needs to open his heart.</p></div>"|17538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17538-the-flower-lane/|7.1|Steven Hyden

Pt. 2</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15210-shaolin-vs-wu-tang/"" target=""_blank""><i>Shaolin Vs. Wu-Tang</i></a> were a pair of traditionalist correctives that established him as the reigning torchbearer for the kung-fu-and-rare-grooves ethos that vaulted the Wu-Tang Clan into prominence 20 years ago. Rae's latest albums have been stellar, but the spattering of interstitial mixtapes he's released as supplements punctuate just how many swings it takes to score a run like <i>Cuban Linx 2</i>'s ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/37262-video-raekwon-surgical-gloves/"" target=""_blank"">Surgical Gloves</a>"". Rae has described his <i>Lost Jewlry</i> EP, a collection of recent unreleased tracks not being used for his next album, <i>F.I.L.A. (Fly International Luxurious Art)</i>, as having the spirit of Nas' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5709-the-lost-tapes/"" target=""_blank"">The </a></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5709-the-lost-tapes/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lost Tapes</i></a>. Unlike the Nas compilation, which housed a number of songs very much deserving of placement on the albums that left them behind<i>, Lost Jewlry </i>occasionally feels like a dumpster dive.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A closer parallel from Raekwon' own discography would be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14112-wu-massacre/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wu-Massacre</i></a>, his 2010 one-off with Method Man and Ghostface Killah. <i>Wu-Massacre</i> was both hastily conceived and frustratingly short, and <i>Lost Jewlry</i>'s brevity is similarly exacerbated by a dearth of fresh ideas. The EP leads with a round of lazily executed mafioso rap boilerplate. On ""Prince of Thieves"", Rae lets go of a clever line about ""Rondos with condos"" but wastes the rest of the song on empty rich guy platitudes, his vocals lagging embarrassingly behind the beat. He changes gears for the ballad ""Hold You Down"", but an emotionally vacant Faith Evans, uncharacteristically standard issue production from Buckwild, and a volley of lyrical clunkers like ""Come here, young lady with the skin of a baby"" and ""No I'm not racial, I'm pro-black” collude to wreck the song. The first 10 of <i>Lost Jewlry</i>'s 30 minutes are a total bore. </p>
<p class=""p1"">When Rae applies himself, he's unflappable, though, and <i>Lost Jewlry</i>'s mid-section sees a slight return to the pointillist renderings of street hustler narratives that color his finest work. Rae spends much of the remainder of <i>Lost Jewlry </i>chewing through a series of uptempo productions and neoclassicist break beat workouts like a legend doing warm-ups. But the spots where he shines also serve to illuminate the castoff nature of the project. Late in the EP he tries his hand at another song about women with ""86'"" and turns in a wistful verse detailing the rise and fall of an easygoing friends-with-benefits arrangement. It would be a winner if he didn't squander a third of it talking trash over DJ Thoro's plush Mtume loop. What's true of ""86'"" is true of <i>Lost Jewlry</i> as a whole. There's quality material here if you’re willing to sift through the filler.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The accelerated release cycles and constant crop-dusting of new material that are becoming industry norm in hip-hop have created a pace that many artists struggle to keep. It suits some and hinders others. Flooding the market worked to the advantage of a beat-jacking demagogue with nothing to lose like 2002 50 Cent, a midlevel talent suddenly gone supernova like 2006 Lil Wayne, and a dependably consistent workaholic like 2012 Curren$y. But a deliberate, formalist storyteller like Raekwon shouldn't fret over cobbling together mixtapes and EPs to keep his buzz warm between albums, especially when stopgap releases like this and 2012's <i>Unexpected Victory </i>come out as gossamer and inessential as they do. <i>Lost Jewlry</i> feels so undercooked next to even the slightest of Raekwon's recent album cuts that you wonder why it had to be released at all.</p></div>"|17654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17654-lost-jewlry/|6.0|Craig Jenkins

Beyond their much talked-about modified instruments, they forswore looping pedals at a time when everyone was pretty sick of looping pedals, putting emphasis on their creative chops. Their names were Arone and Aron, for god's sake. You couldn't dream up a more tempting lede, and it was covered to death by the time of the transitional <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17189-function-falls/""><i>Function Falls</i></a> EP, where ""Gass"" was respelled for phonetic clarity. Their second full-length album, <i>General Dome</i>, feels like a testing ground to see whether <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30394-buke-and-gase/"">Buke and Gase</a> have the aptitude to hold that attention.</p>
<p>They continue to skate their own electric rail between the decorations of prog rock and the cold metallic contours of post-punk. The higher-voiced buke still mainly sings nervy, leaping leads while the snarling gase drives the low end. But some circumstantial changes have had a surprisingly meaningful impact. After Arone Dyer and Aron Sanchez moved from Brooklyn to upstate New York in 2011, Dyer took up motorcycling and replaced her wooden buke with a heavy-duty one made of salvaged automotive steel. Consequently, a new sense of speed and combustion thrums through the music. Majestic opener ""Houdini Crush"" is like a huge engine revving up, then riding wisps of shapely ambient tone. It's intricately structured, with cryptic moods contained in a shuddering shoegaze framework. But it feels like a pop song thanks to Dyer's engaging vocal performance. She can swing limberly between a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"">Karen O</a> yelp and a huskier croon, sounding just like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"">Victoria Legrand</a> when she breathes extra syllables through the word ""inside.""</p>
<p>Most of Buke and Gase's songs are built this way-- incidents and gestures swirling around a theme, above an unstable thud. They're difficult to navigate. Songs peak early to make way for extended elaborations, like the scratchy funk guitar lurching from the jungle rhythms of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14593-general-dome/"">title track</a>, mighty and unresolved. It doesn't end; the big gears just catch and whir to a halt as if suddenly unplugged. The same thing happens at the end of ""Hard Times"", where their pointed interplay is suddenly sweetened as the buke echoes the vocal line. That sweetness is at odds with the violence and depravity that flickers discreetly through the lyrics, which are often deformed by Dyer's rubbery enunciation. The imagery can be compelling or perplexing if you focus on it, but the curious silhouette of her voice commands more attention.</p>
<p>Finely wrought moments are plentiful: Check out when Dyer's voice seamlessly rounds off into a gase lead on the explosively bouncy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13538-buke-and-gase-hiccup/"" target=""_blank"">""Hiccup""</a>, or when the blocky descent of ""Split Like a Lip, No Blood on the Beard"" slips into a dreamy skid, like a car losing traction on ice. But no amount of ingenuity on the duo's part can keep their limited palette from feeling constricted by the end. The bare-bones foot percussion, though resourceful, levels many songs to the same oblivious stomp. The thrilling onward surge of the melodies gradually comes to seem like a search for some vital mortar, a place to alight other than the grungy groove. My ears just get worn out by all the airless staccato, longing for more open chords or smooth continuous tones. But overall, <i>General Dome</i>'s rewards are equal to its considerable demands, proving that there's more to Buke and Gase than a good story.</p></div>"|17563.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17563-general-dome/|7.0|Brian Howe

Between gigs, the three decamped to the north to record <i>La Busta Gialla</i>, committing to tape the oddly assembled jams and elaborate latticework with which they'd been peppering their otherwise Watt-heavy sets. The quickly constructed <i>La Busta Gialla</i> makes for a rickety listen, teetering, as it does, between tautly composed prog and loosely formed grooves that seem to fall apart as they totter along. What's most impressive about <i>La Busta Gialla</i> is how much proper band-stuff-- how does this one go, who takes which lead, that sort of thing-- these three managed to work out in just a few days. Watt-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"" target=""_blank"">Minutemen</a> co-founder, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17834-firehose/"" target=""_blank"">fIREHOSE</a> frontman, human dynamo, bassist extraordinaire, and one-man embodiment of all of punk's highest ideals-- will talk your ear off about music's ability to bring down the boundaries of language, distance, unfamiliarity. And at its best, <i>La Busta Gialla</i> feels like a conversation between three musicians working towards something communal while still feeling each other out.</p>
<p>Like most of the music Watt's made over the years, <i>La Busta Gialla</i> is at its best when it's on the move. Opener ""Zoom"" and immediate follower ""Partisan Song"" are both the album's busiest and best songs; the slightly silly ""Zoom"" plays a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/566-battles/"" target=""_blank"">Battles</a>-style game of brickbreaker, while ""Partisan"" is all post-rock corrosion. The sound here is in constant flux, passing blithely through section after section, and each move keeps you guessing. Watt's playing-- virtuosic but unflashy, melodically daring but never untethered to the tune-- has filtered down through pretty much all the non-cheesy progressive rock that's come in its wake, echoes of which pop up throughout <i>La Busta Gialla</i>. The eternally ageless Watt has always kept an ear to the ground, so it's a thrill to hear him not only in conversation with these two fine young musicians, but with a lot of the music he's inspired (indirectly or otherwise), and he plays the stuff with intensity and drive. He's always been willing to set ego aside to benefit the greater good, but here, he seems especially absorbed into the group dynamic; the bass tends to take the melodic lead, but it's rarely the focal point of these songs. The three read each other remarkably well, moving in lockstep, constantly rearranging themselves.</p>
<p>Things take a turn with ""The Tiger Princess"". After a few minutes of snaky bass, Watt sidles in, doing his best Randall ""Tex"" Cobb, imparting a little road-dog wisdom through a mouthful of gravel. It's so grave, so serious, it's borderline silly; mostly, though, it's just a momentum-killer, as all movement seems to halt while Watt does his spiel. Things get a little dicey whenever anyone in Il Sogno opens their mouths; ""Il Guardino del Faro"" is another Watt rap, this one translated into Italian, delivered over a barely-there bass-and-drone wash. It's not bad once, and I'm sure it was fun live, but amidst the instrumental tug-of-war that surrounds it, ""Guardino"" just feels limp. Still, the real sticking point here is ""Messed-Up Machine"". As the name suggests, it's a deeply troubled groove, a driving-on-a-flat wobble that barely holds itself together through seven increasingly excruciating minutes. It's a glorified rehearsal snippet, more exercise than song, the kind of thing that it's hard to imagine making the LP if Watt had had a few more days on his work visa.</p>
<p>As a record, <i>La Busta Gialla</i>'s not great, just a hair more curious than pleasurable. Still, you've got to give a guy like Watt credit for his willingness to make a peculiar mistake like ""Machine,"" to link up with young, far-flung talents like Pilia and Belfi just to see how that'd go. At the heart of Watt's legendary raps, there's this notion about the importance of engagement: with your convictions, with your community, with something larger than yourself. So when so many of his contemporaries seem content to sit by the phone and wait for the next documentarian to come calling, Watt's off in Italy, making strange records with near-strangers, forever engaged.</p></div>"|17544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17544-la-busta-giallo/|5.7|Paul Thompson

A reverent synthetic patchwork of the past, <i>Raw Cuts Vol. 1</i> was as notable for the warm melodic euphoria it exuded as it was for the conceit that birthed the initial run of singles.</p>
<p>As with many producers, Plessow's reconfiguration of dusty sounds relies on a liberal attitude to sampling; In a 2011 <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1307"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with <i>Resident Advisor</i>, he described his sampling philosophy as ""take everything,"" while also expressing a desire to move past that approach. That wish was apparent on that year's ""L.O.V.E."" single, released in tandem with Plessow's eclectic, leg-stretching <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15684-dj-kicks/"" target=""_blank"">contribution</a> to !K7's <i>DJ-Kicks</i> mix series. A floor-centric cut tucked within a mix that didn't so much play with the notions of house as it did almost totally jettison the genre, ""L.O.V.E."" mixed sultry vocal samples with wavy synths and a circular bass line provided by Plessow himself. It was a fine taste of what was to come, as MCDE's new EP, <i>Send a Prayer</i>, picks up where ""L.O.V.E."" left off. Its four tracks suggest that Plessow has little intention of completely discarding the warm, crackly thump that defines his winning sound-- but that doesn't mean he's not interested in toying with that sound's confines.</p>
<p>The track that opens the EP's A-side, ""Send a Prayer Pt. 1"", is a neat trick of sorts. At first, it sounds fit for <i>Raw Cuts</i>: A decaying vocal sample moans just below brittle percussion as the backbeat enters without warning, accompanied by warm, bleating tones. The beat picks up, and a jazz break with a broken weathervane saxophone line wanders into the mix, accompanied by background crowd chatter and rattling percussion-- then, the track continues unabated, denying the big payoff that such an intrusion suggests. The payoffs on <i>Raw Cuts Vol. 1</i> were abundant, a by-product of Plessow's masterful sense of pacing; when the big twist is removed, as it is here, there's little else left but a sense of simmering unease.</p>
<p>""Send a Prayer Pt. 2"" and the EP's closer, ""SP 11"", also resemble <i>Raw Cuts</i>' aesthetic. The former's patient, conversational persistence clings so close that it could easily be mistaken for a forgotten cut from that collection, while ""SP 11""'s skipping hi-hat and eardrum-rubbing bass thud sound menacing, with dollops of synth glop adding some saucer-eyed bliss to cut the tension. B-side opener ""The Stranger"" breaks the furthest from the pack; it's also the EP's sole inert moment, a pile of percussive rhythms with no real melodic anchor. The results amount to little more than a showcase for Plessow's ample hardware collection.</p>
<p>It's appropriate that <i>Send a Prayer</i>'s weakest moments stray the furthest from <i>Raw Cuts</i>' weathered crate-digging giddiness. While it would be unreasonable to expect that Plessow just creatively jog in place, it's clear that <i>Raw Cuts</i> was the result of someone arriving at an immensely enjoyable sound that sounded relatively fresh, despite its debts to the past. Listening chronologically to the run of non-<i>Raw Cuts</i> singles that saw release between 2007 and 2009, you can hear Plessow starting from somewhere stylistically <i>pro forma</i> within the house genre and slowly finding his own footing, a sound that he could conceivably call his own. <i>Send a Prayer</i> is the first bulk release of new Motor City Drum Ensemble material in nearly three years, and Plessow's stated that he prefers to work at his own pace when it comes to releasing new output. So who knows when we'll hear from him again under this guise, but if this EP is any indication, his next move will be worth anticipating.</p></div>"|17561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17561-send-a-prayer-ep/|7.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

But it had a certain youthful scrappiness, too. Alongside expansive tracks like ""Shape Shifter"" and ""Wide Eyes"", there were the silly howls that introduced ""Airplanes"" and the shouty breakdown of ""Sun Hands"", both of which brought comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>. All told, it was very of-the-moment with influences to match. Guitarist/singer Taylor Rice cited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/475-broken-social-scene/"" target=""_blank"">Broken Social Scene</a> in an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/37331-rising-local-natives/"">interview</a> around the time of the album's release, and anyone following along with big-tent indie rock could pick up on other borrowed elements: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a>'s choirboy sway, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a>'s starched-shirt seriousness, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5653-fleet-foxes/"" target=""_blank"">Fleet Foxes</a>' rolling melodicism. But while the songwriting was strong, you had to wonder if the band would prove to be more than the sum of their influences. </p>
<p><i>Hummingbird</i>, Local Natives' second album, offers a tricky answer to that question. They're still on the same path-- no fashionable synths or newfound fixation with 1990s R&amp;B here-- but innovation seems beside the point. This is a record of lateral growth, one that finds the band establishing their own place among their contemporaries. Ironically, they've found their sound with the assistance of one of their major <span>forebears</span>: the National's Aaron Dessner performs and contributes songwriting on <i>Hummingbird</i>, and shares production credit with the band while recording with them in his Brooklyn studio. (His brother and bandmate, Bryce, contributed horn arrangements to several songs, too.)</p>
<p>As with member-cum-producers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie/"" target=""_blank"">Death Cab for Cutie</a>'s Chris Walla and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a>'s Dave Sitek, Dessner's production style isn't terribly distinctive. But he knows how to make things sound <i>good</i>, and there's plenty of richness and depth to these songs. Bassist Andy Hamm left Local Natives in 2011, leaving Local Natives as a quartet; on <i>Hummingbird</i>, Aaron Dessner acts as fifth band member of the group.</p>
<p>In our <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8924-local-natives/"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with the band last year, they described the split with Hamm as ""heartbreaking,"" and it wasn't the only loss suffered following <i>Gorilla Manor</i>'s release: lead vocalist Kelcey Ayer's mother passed away last summer. Accordingly, the brightness and boisterousness of <i>Gorilla Manor </i>is mostly absent. Advance track ""Breakers"" is a pulsating rush of drum fills and ""ooh""s that deflates to nearly nothing just as the wordless hook begins to sink in. There are other ominous touches: the tangled vocal ascent of ""You &amp; I"", ""Black Spot""'s closing instrumental tumble, the static laden ""Wooly Mammoth"", one of many cuts that showcases drummer Matt Frazier's knack for creating expressive, overwhelming washes of rhythm. Lyrics convey the anxiety and depressed confusion. Where <i>Gorilla Manor</i> tried to capture the feeling of twentysomething malaise (""Water's in the clouds/ Is my life about to change?/ Who knows?/ Who cares?""); here words are more vivid, conveying scenes of hopelessness and the feeling that everyone you know around you is slowly becoming a stranger.</p>
<p>Lyrically, they're best when they're at their most direct. ""Colombia""'s beautiful swell takes syncopated bass and stately piano and grows into something warm and emotionally cathartic. Vocally, Ayer takes a lilting upper register, leaning into it more and more as his lonely voice turns pleading while addressing his deceased mother: ""If you never felt all of my love/ I pray now you do"". On an album that spans a wide range of emotions, ""Colombia"" is <i>Hummingbird</i>'s most affecting moment; it's also one of the best songs the band's ever written.</p>
<p>Although there are a number of fine uptempo songs, <i>Hummingbird</i>'s strongest moments are the quiet, elegiac cuts similar to ""Colombia"": the brief, sweetly sung ""Ceilings"", the skyward wails of ""Three Months"", Ayer's simmering solo take on the verses of ""Heavy Feet"". Subtlety is key, and <i>Hummingbird</i> is nothing if not subtle. There's nothing as melodic as ""Airplanes"" or ""World News"" on here, but this isn't a bad thing. With <i>Hummingbird</i>, Local Natives have made a thoughtful, lovely album with small gestures that provide great rewards. </p></div>"|17537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17537-hummingbird/|8.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

Now there's almost something quaint about it, especially considering (and not in spite of) the hashtagged millions that comprise the Little Monsters, Swifties, and Beliebers, who are as much a marketing tool as the groups being marketed to. Although they get a decent amount of exposure each time they release a record, until now, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4371-tegan-and-sara/"" target=""_blank"">Tegan and Sara</a>'s sustained success has been down to a core fanbase. The title of their seventh album, <i>Heartthrob</i>, is a reference to how we relate to the objects of our affection as teenagers, that obsessive feeling that you live and die by for a few years, and how those crushes usually end up getting replaced by real, mutually loving relationships. Being someone who's liked this band to varying degrees of intensity for a decade, it's easy to interpret the name as the Quins recognizing their own role in their more devoted fans' lives. Doing so at the same time as they decide to make an album with pop impresario Greg Kurstin and dabble in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYSztDJK7CY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writing</a> for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30955-carly-rae-jepsen/"" target=""_blank"">Carly Rae Jepsen</a> might seem a little like selling their cow for a handful of supposedly magic beans.</p>
<p>Some folks have accused the duo of selling out with <i>Heartthrob</i>-- a concise 10 songs, at least half of which could be pop radio singles-- to which I'd argue that accessibility has always been a part of their appeal, in more respects than just working in friendly acoustic, rock, and electro-pop mediums. Surely part of the comfort of their music, at least to a young person quietly negotiating their sexuality without wanting to be obvious about it, is that it doesn't make a big deal of what it's come to represent. It's not like putting on an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12819-ani-difranco/"" target=""_blank"">Ani DiFranco</a> record in your bedroom and the lyrics sparking a parent's ear. One thing they've not been shy about in their songs, however, is ambition-- there's a sweet example of that on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5613-chris-walla/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Walla</a>-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13644-sainthood/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sainthood</i></a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb0aDTjWrzo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Someday""</a>-- and more power to them for deciding to explore a populist bent on <i>Heartthrob</i>, which pulls it off with aplomb.</p>
<p>The clearest sign that the Quins would follow this path lies in <i>Sainthood</i>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11582-alligator/"" target=""_blank"">""Alligator""</a>, an insanely catchy, arid little pop song that had become Sara's trademark. (""Shock to Your System"" and ""How Come You Don't Want Me"" carry on that impulse here.) But it was also a sign of the growing disparity between the twins' respective songwriting styles; Tegan's efforts on that record were stormy emo/power pop blasts, and the two didn't gel to the extent that it seemed fair to wonder whether it made sense for them to continue recording together. The Roxette and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6272-cyndi-lauper/"" target=""_blank"">Cyndi Lauper</a>-referencing, soaring keyboard pop of <i>Heartthrob</i> is a welcome stylistic reconciliation, if one that sacrifices their sonic weirdness.</p>
<p>Kurstin has taken Tegan and Sara's ability to write a solid refrain (some of their old songs were arguably all refrain) and channeled it into rushing, skyward stadium pop songs where their voices are more upfront, and less tethered to their former prickly structures. ""Closer"" is the killer, starting with Tegan's coy, tightly wound vocal laying out what she's after-- ""All I dream of lately/ Is how to get you underneath me""-- the triumphantly shouted chorus coming off brash and charming, as if she knows she's definitely going to get it. It's a gloriously freeing, retrospective retelling of first infatuations, rewriting the script to articulate what you could only think about furiously back when.</p>
<p>""Closer""'s trad structure is typical of most of the songs on the record, but ""Now I'm All Messed Up"" breaks through its crackly piano and static whirr of a chorus with piercing, layered pleas: ""Go! Go! Go if you want, I can't stop you!"" It plays like a Wham! ballad repurposed as a glitchy, modern slow jam, which, in case that needs clarifying, is brilliant. The lyrics are a great, tragic portrait of post-split heartbreak-- ""Now I'm all messed up, sick inside wondering where/ Where you're leaving your make-up""-- but the song as a whole never sounds anything less than fully empowering.</p>
<p>On <i>Heartthrob</i>, Tegan and Sara sing about solitude, regret, and self-loathing alongside romance, but most of its 10 songs <i>feel</i> amazing. That's not a sign of cognitive dissonance, but their considerable abilities fusing with those of Kurstin to drag their music out of headphones and into zones of unabashed communal euphoria and delight. The dramatic, ravey swish of ""Goodbye, Goodbye"" and new wavey tick of ""I'm Not Your Hero"" actually deal with the problem of coming across differently to your true self, and the risks you incur to reconcile that gap, whether that means losing someone or admitting that you're lost inside.</p>
<p>Making a relatively conventional sounding pop record-- not an acceptably hip, minimalist one produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29639-blood-orange/"" target=""_blank"">Devonte Hynes</a> or Ariel Rechtshaid-- is a small risk in itself for the duo; for one, if its charms don't chime with sales, I can't imagine Warners keeping on a band whose last album sold 110k. Its misfires are few, if pronounced: On ""Drove Me Wild"", Tegan's voice is pitched up to sound unrecognizable, and the blandness of the music doesn't exactly inspire a wild vocal take-- it sounds like the music on an ad for Ibiza package holidays; ""Love They Say"" dies under slimy 90s production, bland acoustic verses, and a string of clichés about love (""true,"" ""blind"") that an actual teenager would probably balk at scrawling on a ""Love is..."" notelet.</p>
<p>At its best, however, <i>Heartthrob</i> brings the 32-year old siblings' more adult, romantic touch to a record that roundly avoids turning into any old generic, radio-friendly collection: ""Love like ours is never fixed,"" Tegan sings on the classic piano pop of ""I Was a Fool"". It's hard to believe you could ever feel differently when you're a teenager crushing so hard you could cry at the injustice of your emotions going unrecognized. One of the strongest ideas Tegan and Sara give anyone who's ever plotted their identity by their music is the potential for change and transformation. For the unconverted, a temporary suspension of cynicism may be required.</p></div>"|17597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17597-heartthrob/|7.3|Laura Snapes

Florida rapper <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30986-kitty/"" target=""_blank"">Kathryn Beckwith</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30518-kitty-pryde/"" target=""_blank"">once known as Kitty Pryde</a> and now just Kitty, has made a point of breaking that rule. She uses her <a href=""http://kittydothedishes.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> to publicly sift through the vitriol and praise; she mocks her detractors, responds to calls for advice and questions about her life, and her relationship. She warns her readers of the brutal effects of disordered eating. She posts screenshots of reviews of her music. She revels in the feedback loop. ""[I post the comments because] I want the shawtyz to get the attention they crave ( : 0,"" she wrote one day, employing some basic reverse-psychology tactics.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Kitty must have a constitution stronger than most, or she is one of those masochistic, online-native creatures for whom anonymous feedback is fuel. Her new EP, <i>D.A.I.S.Y Rage</i>, sounds entirely unfazed by the grade-school chatter she's monitored closely over the last six months. The eight-track collection is a sharper articulation of the Web 2.0 bubblegum rap we heard last summer on her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16894-haha-im-sorry-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>haha, i'm sorry</i></a> EP. She's joined by some new collaborators-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a> affiliates Mike Finito and Lakutis, Grantbeats and Hot Sugar-- but they complement her themes instead of shifting them. To anyone who paid attention to <i>haha i'm sorry</i>, <i>D.A.I.S.Y. Rage</i> will feel familiar, feeding on warm, sparkly beats and topical rap nerdery asserted with a defiantly Disney Channel attitude.</p>
<p>Playing on Wu Tang's ""C.R.E.A.M."", Kitty makes light of allergic reactions, rapping ""Rash rules everything around me/ Getting drowsy/ Bena-bena-dryl, y'all"" She's titled one song ""Scout Finch Bitch"" but she's really more of a Holden Caulfield: ""I hate everyone that wants to be a millionaire/ So freakin' bad/ So freakin' bad,"" she complains on ""Skrillionaire"". She's a deft lyrical whistle-blower, arguing that ""You're about as fraudulent as a mirage out in the desert/ Blue peacock/ You're puffing out your feathers/ To bring a bunch of bitches backstage into your dressing room/ So you could treat it like a petting zoo,"" on ""No Offense"", a song that might read like an indictment of her friend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a>. But she's as self-conscious as she is critical, rapping on ""Skrillionaire"", ""I'm bitter 'cause I do cool shit and you ignore it.""</p>
<p>Kitty's voice is still saccharine, her tone precious to the point of sounding infantile. For a lot of listeners, that's reason to stop the tape immediately, but <span>anyone who dismisses </span><i>D.A.I.S.Y. Rage</i><span> on that basis will miss out on the entrancing tensions of the EP. It w</span>alks the line between naive and savvy, between earnest and winking, confessional and oversharing, bratty and bold, experimental and inexperienced. Kitty pulls at threads that have been woven through reality-based art in the last couple of years-- I think of Canadian writer Sheila Heti's autobiographical novel, <i>How Should a Person Be?</i>, Cat Marnell's obsessive and Adderall-fueled self-documentation. She's one in a line of young women grasping many conflicting ideas at the same time; her position as a teenage white girl making rap leads to art that feels exciting both because and in spite of its unorthodoxy. </p>
<p>Part of the draw is that Kitty is hyper-aware of the tensions. On the EP's standout ""Dead Island"", she raps that ""you weren't able to discern if I'm the wunderkind or underdog,"" laying out another one of the fissures. That track is a haunting ode to New York City, a brief hallucinatory journey that sounds like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer/"" target=""_blank"">Major Lazer</a> beat is drowning. It's also both her most affecting and self-lacerating song to date, and it points to Kitty's ticket out of her sometimes-gimmicky perspective: her anguish. ""Wiz is black and yellow and I'm white and fucking terrible,"" she says, before she serves up one of the most chilling assessments of the city that I've ever heard: ""I love NY because there's so many bridges to jump off."" She knows that reading the comments can remind you that you're not an island.</p></div>"|17595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17595-daisy-rage-ep/|6.9|Carrie Battan

For one, there's singer Jim Putnam, who's been at the controls during the past two decades of frequent lineup changes. Their sprawling catalog has also been unified by a general lack of urgency, which has allowed them the ability to pass for pre-Limewire indie classifications such as slowcore, shoegaze, folk-rock, and even alt-country, the last one largely due to their name. For the most part, the Radar Bros. have made it work for them, creating music that can simultaneously be described as both sun-baked and moving at a glacial pace. But the third constant is hinted at by <i>Eight</i>'s truth-in-advertising title; this is the eighth Radar Bros. album and the eighth one that's too inconsistent to push them from the periphery to the center of discussion, a handful of truly striking songs padded out by a greater number of perfectly pleasant ones.</p>
<p><i>Eight</i> does show a desire to alter that perception, though its most visceral track barely crawls. ""If We Were Banished"" sounds like little else on <i>Eight</i>, a godhonest throwback to shoegaze-indebted alt-rock bands like Hum, Failure, and Medicine (of which Putnam was a former member) that tweaks the blown-out guitar/drowsy vocal formula ever so slightly; Putnam’s voice is even lower than usual amidst the frothy chords and the tendency for songs of this nature to churn through a single progression makes each melodic turn sound even more forceful and unexpected. It's an interesting dichotomy, sounding both like it's constantly building and slowly decaying at the same time.</p>
<p>Thing is, for all its attempts to distance itself from Radar Brothers' previous work, relativity is <i>Eight</i>'s greatest asset-- ""Reflections"" and ""Time Rolling By"" generate enough momentum to nominally ""rock,"" but they only rock compared to other Radar Brothers songs. Likewise, while these are the most clearly legible Radar Bros. songs, this shift often demonstrates Putnam's frequent lapses into cumbersome diction and doughy melodies. ""Change College of Law"" wisely gives up on its melodically stiff and awkwardly-worded hook to bash out a little bit towards the end, and lyrics like ""winding up on the couch that swallows pain"" seems about right, as most of <i>Eight </i>appears to acknowledge pain while being overly passive about it. In the same song (""Couch""), Putnam drawls about fighting over current events without sounding even the least bit ornery or aware of the day's news. Meanwhile, ""Ebony Bow"" has a queasy verse that belongs in a more avant-garde setting, while ""Angler's Life"" and ""Bottle Song"" are too slick for country, not hard enough for rock, and not quite literary enough for NPR, but probably the right tenor for a Grant Lee Phillips solo album.</p>
<p>So really, it doesn't turn out all that different from the most recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1284-earlimart/"" target=""_blank"">Earlimart</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/311-beachwood-sparks/"" target=""_blank"">Beachwood Sparks</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6067-jason-lytle/"" target=""_blank"">Jason Lytle</a> records: perfectly okay, not pushy enough to be even remotely unpleasant, and in a way you're hoping it's better, since not only would you get a good record out of the deal, but the attendant staying power would somehow retroactively validate a certain time period. Instead, it's a nice consolation, a testament to keeping the faith in a bygone kind of genial, shaggy Californian Y2k ideal of indie rock, but I'd like to think there was more to its <a href=""http://www.sugarmount.com/uploads/2010/06/joni_mitchell_the_hissing_of_summer_lawns.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover art homage</a> to <i>Hissing of Summer Lawns</i> than simply sounding like a perfect accompaniment to a game of horseshoes in the front yard.</p></div>"|17596.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17596-eight/|6.0|Ian Cohen

<p>Pillowfight is Nakamura's collaboration with singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Emily Wells-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2281-kid-koala/"" target=""_blank"">Kid Koala</a> put Nakamura in contact with her after they performed together at a Canadian music festival. He provides the instrumentation, she sings, and if the setup suggests a post-modern, hip-hop-inflected reincarnation of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra, that's probably not an accident.</p>
<p>Wells' voice sometimes resembles Sinatra's when she sends it floating up over Nakamura's instrumental bed. Sometimes it sounds a little like a passable, fourth-generation copy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2040-billie-holiday/"" target=""_blank"">Billie Holiday</a> in blues mode. But for much of the record she deploys a coy, breathy coo that more than anything else sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank"">Lana Del Rey</a> stripped of the elegant swoon and old-Hollywood drama that stopped <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16223-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank""><i>Born to Die</i></a> just coming off as camp. After years of collaborating with deeply compelling, oddball vocalists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1139-dr-octagon/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Octagon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5804-mike-patton/"" target=""_blank"">Mike Patton</a>, Nakamura's decision to work with such an unremarkable performer is a disappointment.</p>
<p>The letdowns don't stop there. At this point in his career, Nakamura's biggest liability is his past success. When he first came on the scene, blending hip-hop's muscular percussion and collage-like production techniques with esoteric sounds-- like jazzy swinging-60s bachelor pad pop and a cheekily lowbrow crate-digger attitude-- was novel. But it turned out to be easily reproducible, and since then Nakamura's formula has been copied an untold number of times, and the mainstream pop success of producers who have run with his style (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1186-danger-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Danger Mouse</a> being the biggest) has inspired even more imitators. At this point, Nakamura's once-<i>sui generis</i> sonic personality has been replicated past the point of cliche.</p>
<p>Nakamura has done little to advance his sound in that time, preferring instead to refine the one he already had. By this point it's been polished smooth enough that you can sit through the entirety of <i>Pillowfight</i> waiting for something unexpected to snag your attention before walking away disappointed 12 songs later. Every sonic element is in its proper place, and none of them misbehaves. The album projects a swanky modernism that the managers of medium-high-end wine bars and lounges might love, but other listeners will find its good manners stifling.</p>
<p>There are a few bright points scattered about. <i>Pillowfight</i>'s strongest song, the album-opening ""Used to Think"", has a darkly dramatic atmosphere emphasized by a funereal garage rock organ, ominous strings, and one of the few performances on the record where Wells shows a little edge-- the generic ""you"" that she's singing to resolves into something resembling an actual person. Unfortunately, its meandering structure and the hokey backup vocals on the chorus sink the song. And Kid Koala shows up with his turntables a few times throughout the album to add a much-needed dose of dizzy whimsy.</p>
<p>Ultimately the record's main problem seems to be that Nakamura has simply become too good at being Dan the Automator, to the point where his recordings have started to sound like a very well executed copy of his past work. <i>Pillowfight</i> is technically flawless but thoroughly unexciting. Sounds great though.</p></div>"|17546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17546-pillowfight/|3.9|Miles Raymer

""They need bitches no speaky no INGLO,"" he squawks on ""Ceelo"", the third track on the Atlanta warbler's latest freebie mixtape, <i>Future Presents FBG: The Movie</i>. If your baseline qualification for good rap is that the rapper's words sit pretty on the page, Future will make you afraid of the future and you'll probably give up before ""Intro"", a series of rambling statements like, ""That yopper on me! Haiti on me!"", is over. ""I don't really freestyle,"" Future demurred in his latest <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TQkl6hz_38"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">appearance</a> on Pitchfork.tv's ""Selector"". Thousands of rap traditionalists nodded their heads vehemently in agreement.</p>
<p>But Future is not degrading the conversation-- he's pushing hard on one of rap's remaining frontiers: extreme voice manipulation. On <i>FBG: The Movie</i>, he comes up with some of the most unprecedented noises ever to qualify as mainstream pop music: rodent squeaks, baby gurgles, goat-bleats. His debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16554-pluto/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pluto</i></a>, despite its hints and flirtations, wasn't quite as weird or as catchy as advertised; I wanted to have my brain twisted harder, possibly until I yelped. On <i>FBG</i>, Future twists as hard as he can, and as a courtesy, even does the yelping for me.</p>
<p>Mainstream rap's love affair with AutoTune, and with the possibilities of using software designed to discreetly improve voices to blatantly mangle them, has grown more intense with every passing year. But Future's use of it is the most visceral yet. <i>FBG</i> takes what <i>Pluto</i> hinted at to glorious, crazed extremes: On the repetitive hook, ""Who you thank you is?"", on ""Mark Mcquire"", he hardly sounds human. ""Keep On Shinin"" repeats the vocal so many times that the effect becomes hallucinatory. ""Karate Chop"" exaggerates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29609-soulja-boy/"" target=""_blank"">Soulja Boy</a>'s stuttering delivery to its logical extreme, so that Future's mangled voice becomes just another firing piston in the cartoon assembly line of Metro Boomin's production.</p>
<p><i>The production on this</i>. The funereal string section and horns of ""Chosen One""; the senses-obliterating, trance-house breakdown on ""Fo Real""; the organ and pellet-dispenser synth collision on ""Karate Chop""; the Flash Man stage insanity of ""Finessin;"" whatever the fuck is happening to those horns on ""DNA"". Mashing together the martial thud of Lex Luger with the antic 8-bit mischief of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"" target=""_blank"">Gucci Mane</a>'s frequent collaborator Zaytoven, <i>FBG</i> arrives at a sound that is both enormous and oddly giggly, apt to make you either feel invincible or like a visitor to Toon Town, or both.</p>
<p>The unlikeliest aspect of <i>FBG: The Movie</i>'s success is its billing: This is nominally a crew mixtape, usually the moment a rapper gets famous enough to allow his less-talented friends to run rampant the booth and ruin the vibe. There are some time-marking verses to sit through here, and the tape is quite long at 24 tracks and and hour plus, but <i>FBG</i> doesn't fit this mold any more than last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16172-rich-forever/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rich Forever</i></a> deserved to be considered a free appetizer for the main course. Like <i>Rich Forever</i>, <i>FBG</i> is a narrative-shaping release disguised as a promotional giveaway.</p>
<p>There is one moment of <i>Pluto</i>-style reflective melancholy on <i>FBG</i> called ""Appeal"", but Future doesn't even perform it; instead he deputizes Freeband Gang associate Young Scooter. <i>FBG</i> is Future's victory lap, and he is entirely in crazed-exultation mode. He's everywhere on <i>FBG</i>, like the old Bugs Bunny cartoon in which Bugs plays every baseball position simultaneously, including the chatty catcher. Future has found a blunt-force way to assault rap's boundaries, and on <i>FBG</i>, he's emboldened, smashing away at everything in his path. </p></div>"|17651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17651-fbg/|7.6|Jayson Greene

While there's a definite lineage and history here, the quartet's self-titled debut is about today-- being young, broke, drunk, ecstatic, and not worrying too much about what happens next.</p>
<p>The 14-song collection includes a song called ""No Waves"" that sounds a lot like Wavves (as does the descriptive ""Wake Bake Skate""). There's also a song called ""Max Can't Surf"" about their ""ginger"" drummer's lack of balance, and plenty of West Coast party anthems. But you're probably right to assume that, while punning on ""no wave,"" the ""waves"" in that title is also a nod to Nathan Williams' similarly snotty project. Like Odd Future, these guys established their band identity via the internet, and they're savvy about their references. </p>
<p>Toward the end of December, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49015-listen-to-fidlar-cover-the-descendents/"" target=""_blank"">FIDLAR covered the Descendents' ""Suburban Home""</a> for Filter's <i>Milo Turns 50: Songs of the Descendents</i> compilation. That classic California punk quartet are obvious influences on the scatological, silly subject matter of FIDLAR; where the Descendents fixated on farts, girls, coffee, and not growing up, though, FIDLAR populate their songs with cheap beer, cheap cocaine, cheap weed, and ""shitty pills."" And their sound is closer to former tourmates Black Lips and, at times, their early heroes Blink-182 (see the vocal lines of ""Five to Nine"" and ""No Waves"" or their cover of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfgjQ3vxeV0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dammit""</a>) than it is 1980s SST. But the spirit is there: While you'd never mistake FIDLAR's playful approach for that of, say, the intense snarl of Black Flag, they'd do a great job with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGyOEWGtmRk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""TV Party""</a>.</p>
<p>Despite their youth, you get the sense that these guys have been playing music for a long time. (It's worth noting guitarist Elvis and his brother, drummer Max, are the sons of T.S.O.L. keyboardist Greg Kuehn.) They've operated as FIDLAR since 2009, and released a couple of EPs prior to this collection. That time was spent honing a brand of hopped up, surfy garage punk that comes with more variety than you might expect. They veer from sounds that evoke the Ramones (""LDA"", the opening to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14160-cheap-beer/"" target=""_blank"">""Cheap Beer""</a>, and the general ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" vibe) to poppier take on the Germs minus the danger and the Misfits minus the goth. They also weave in western acoustic elements in a move reminiscent of the Gun Club (""Gimme Something"", ""Cheap Cocaine,"" ""Whore"").</p>
<p>But, again, the way FIDLAR seem to function as their own clique is most reminiscent of the Descendents and their life-philosophy espousing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57KRIb-YDWY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All-O-Gistics""</a>. Though beneath the sunny hooks,<i>  FIDLAR</i> suggests a darker, more nihilstic worldview. In ""Stoked and Broke"" they shout: ""I just wanna get really high/ Smoke weed until I die.../ There's nothing wrong with living like this/ All my friends are pieces of shit."" And as they like to remind you in interviews and at their live shows, FIDLAR is an acronym for ""fuck it, dog, life's a risk."" That said, across these 39 minutes, they also make life sound like a lot of fun.</p></div>"|17559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17559-fidlar/|7.0|Brandon Stosuy

Sure, a key element of Skrillex's appeal is the enormous release that comes with the drop, but it's equally important to have pleasant sounds as contrast. The move toward warmth isn't limited to the most obvious of brostep producers. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> isn't soundtracking raves quite yet, but he's certainly shifted towards accessibility, moving from the eerie glitchfest of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12132-los-angeles/"" target=""_blank""><i>Los Angeles</i></a> in 2008, to the settled comfort of last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17115-until-the-quiet-comes/"" target=""_blank""><i>Until the Quiet Comes</i></a>.</p>
<p>Even some of our iciest producers seem vulnerable to this gradual instrumental warming. Take FlyLo's sometime Low End Theory associate, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27935-nosaj-thing/"" target=""_blank"">Nosaj Thing</a>. The Los Angeles producer's debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13251-drift/"" target=""_blank""><i>Drift</i></a>, (which came out a year after <i>Los Angeles</i>) was an icy chasm, a shifting cave of sound that seemed as if it could have originated in the coldest reaches of space. But his new album, <i>Home</i>, serves as a kind of twilight to <i>Drift</i>'s midnight, elaborating on his sound while taking a welcome turn towards the light.</p>
<p>That's not to say that Nosaj Thing, born Jason Chung, is suddenly making full-fledged pop. The darkness hasn't disappeared entirely. But occasional hints of pop clarity lie trapped just beneath the surface of many tracks on the new album. The shift is surprising given Chung's former penchant for working in huge dark spaces and his origin in the realm of glitch-hop, a subgenre that frequently posits intricacy as its own kind of beauty. But it's not unwelcome, considering the producer has clearly retained his ability to produce the studied soundscapes that made his debut so promising. It's just the sharp edges are now complemented by some soft ones.</p>
<p>The change is particularly obvious when Chung employs vocalists. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/395-blonde-redhead/"" target=""_blank"">Blonde Redhead</a>'s frontwoman Kazu Makino transforms the plaintive ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14282-eclipseblue-ft-kazu-makino/"" target=""_blank"">Eclipse/Blue</a>"" into a particularly pillowy affair, a torrent of the kind of grey and blue sounds that are described in the lyrics. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"" target=""_blank"">Toro Y Moi</a>-featuring ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14787-try-ft-toro-y-moi/"" target=""_blank"">Try</a>"" and its accompanying ""Prelude"" are downright lovely; a slow tapestry of summoning synths soon gives way to epic fireworks reminiscent of the intro to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hurry Up We're Dreaming</i></a>. When Chaz Bundick's voice comes in about halfway through ""Try"", his wispy voice blows beautifully through the music, sounding aloft within the mix.</p>
<p>What distinguishes Chung's production from that of M83 is its nuance and its lack of obvious sentimentality. Nearly every track on <i>Home</i> is downtempo, but multiple backbeats help to direct the flow of energy-- doubling down on bass on a song like ""Snap"" makes for a dynamic listen. On the surface, the song resembles something that a bombastic producer like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"" target=""_blank"">Rustie</a> might make for a peaceful Sunday afternoon, but upon further inspection, it isn't quite as peaceful as it first appears. A close listen reveals a busy world of secondary beats and electronic runs fluttering underneath the mix's outer membrane. ""Glue"" has so many ping-pong echoes and backing beats that it takes a moment to locate the rhythm that's actually moving the track along.</p>
<p>On <i>Drift</i>, melodies existed to accentuate complex beats like these, as on ""Fog"", where chilly synthesizers wove in and out of an asthmatic gasp of a bassline. Even when light broke in on a slow descending bridge, it was still accompanied by that breathless sound, something like Gollum trying to catch his breath in Beijing. The closest comparison on <i>Home</i> is the title track, which opens the album. A synth line moves through a dark chorus of voices until it arrives at a shuddering epicenter that woulnd't have felt out of place on that 2009 album. ""Distance"", too, is somewhat cold-blooded at first, as a brief synth flutter foreshadows an ominous minor key transformation that threatens to dominate when the beat vanishes midway through. But, in a nice microcosm of the album's direction, it uses those minor keys to produce a gorgeous swirling effect that re-ups and reamps when the beat returns.</p>
<p>If any more evidence were needed of the change in Nosaj Thing's sound, album closer ""Light #3"", the third in a trilogy that appears throughout <i>Drift</i>, would serve as proof. Numbers one and two, both of them absolutely stunning tracks in their own right, offer sharpness as beauty, a panoply of cutting sounds choreographed exquisitely. By contrast, the piano that begins the third volume leads in to a gentle mountain of strings and voices, just as beautiful as the first two, but peaceful too, never threatening to overwhelm. Jason Chung may not have put out any music in the last four years, but he appears to have used that time well. <i>Home</i> is an ace of a second album, one which maintains the most important elements of Chung's painstakingly crafted sound while progressing nicely into a friendlier arena.</p></div>"|17557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17557-home/|7.8|Jonah Bromwich

Fauntleroy was featured prominently on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/806-common/"" target=""_blank"">Common</a>'s <i>The Dreamer/The Believer </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30593-good-music/"" target=""_blank"">G.O.O.D. Music</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16994-cruel-summer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cruel Summer</i></a> as well, but he keeps an impossibly low profile as a solo artist. Lately he's been stepping out as the vocalist of veteran Chicago hip-hop producer No ID's side project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29776-cocaine-80s/"" target=""_blank"">Cocaine 80s</a>, which also counts ace hip-hop engineer Rob Kinelski and in-demand session musicians Kevin Randolph and Steve Wyreman among its ranks. <i>The Flower of Life</i>, their fourth in a series of low stakes free EP releases, is an eccentric collection of songs that get over in large part because of Fauntleroy's fantastic voice.</p>
<p>Randolph, Wyreman, and Fauntleroy played house band for No ID's stints as producer-in-residence for Common's <i>The Dreamer/The Believer</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"" target=""_blank"">Big Sean</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15605-finally-famous/"" target=""_blank""><i>Finally Famous </i></a>in 2011, and <i>The Flower of Life</i>'s ""Kuro to Shiro"" and ""Fly Ass Pisces"" both reprise the soulful live band boom bap and full-bodied textural heft of those releases. The former adorns dueling guitar leads and chunky bass with programmed drums and twinkling keyboard ephemera, while the latter sees Wyreman trading ""Kuro to Shiro""'s Thin Lizzy licks for cleaner, jazzier ones as Fauntleroy and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a> associate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29698-jhene-aiko/"" target=""_blank"">Jhené Aiko</a> trade sly come-ons and romantic affirmations. Common drops in on both, turning in a pair of capable verses if never quite matching his devastating turn on ""Summer Madness"" from the group's debut, <i>The Pursuit</i>. ""Ground"" is a sprightly pop light grenade built around noodly acoustic guitar, tasteful strings, and a tongue-twisting vocal from Fauntleroy. Cocaine 80s' handle on hip-hop and R&amp;B is effortless, but <i>The Flower of Life </i>is about soldiering beyond comfort zones.</p>
<p>""The Distant River"" is a stately doo wop number cut from the same cloth as the Fauntleroy-penned ""Get It Over With"" from Rihanna's <i>Unapologetic</i> that showcases his penchant for limber interlocking vocal runs. EP closer ""Lucid"" is just James and an acoustic guitar with groundswells of tremolo guitar ebbing and flowing underfoot. ""The Sun and the Moon"" rides a sedate, psychedelic groove to a washed out coda straight out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/339-the-beta-band/"" target=""_blank"">the Beta Band</a>'s playbook. Later ""Higher Self"" toys with lumbering, angular math rock. <i>The Flower of Life</i>'s more experimental passages are largely successful, although ""The Distant River"" leans too close to solo Sting schmaltz for comfort, and ""The Sun and the Moon"" sounds as much like hokey post-grunge as anything else. But James Fauntleroy is the beating heart of this project, and his angelic, multi-tracked vocals carry it through sporadic moments of questionable taste, anchoring <i>The Flower of Life</i>'s stylistic hard left turns in an undeniable tunefulness.</p>
<p>Cocaine 80s is a team of hip-hop's best hired guns cutting loose and following the muse down a rabbit hole. <i>The Flower of Life</i> succeeds where it does thanks to the chemistry and genre-busting adventurousness of its players, but the major takeaway here is James Fauntleroy's formidable talent. He can sell a crass come-on like ""You deserve lovin' all day, and you deserve fuckin' all night"" in ""The Sun and the Moon"", and the gallows humor of ""Lucid""'s ""I heard the world could end tomorrow/ Least we won't have to pay the bills"" with the same disarming directness. If he wanted to, Fauntleroy could totally stockpile a handful of hits for himself and parlay his industry connects into a respectable solo career like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">The-Dream</a> and Frank Ocean did, but if he wants to farm the obvious hits out to artists with greater reach and hang out in the shadows releasing these intermittent blasts of impossibly hooky, subtly experimental R&amp;B, he's more than welcome to.</p></div>"|17666.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17666-the-flower-of-life/|7.5|Craig Jenkins

People are boring. Work sucks. The only break from this banal place is sleeping. Their song ""Hello Frustration"" namechecks anxiety, neurosis, nerves, and depression. The title track's message is simple-- you eat, you sleep, and then you repeat. In the track ""Grump"": ""It's all downhill from here."" The Seattle punk trio use their platform to illustrate the more banal facets of everyday life, and in straightforward terms, they point out what's terrible about each societal norm. Their solutions are simple, if impractical: ""Quit Your Job"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14656-nap/"">""Nap""</a>.</p>
<p>Their messages follow an antagonistic tradition of Seattle punk. Just as the Intelligence recently call-and-response ordered folks to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbSS6Jc3o8o&amp;feature=plcp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">turn off ""that freedom rock,""</a> Wimps demand that ""everyone stop having fun right now."" (Drummer Dave Ramm is a former member of the Intelligence.) You can also hear the sonic threads of punk rock's past throughout the album. Their sing-shouting vocals occasionally bring to mind those of belter-in-chief, Corin Tucker, and they deliver each song with buoyant new wave guitars, and of course, a few distortion-laden power chord hooks. With a specific point-of-view and a few catchy songs, guitarist Rachel Ratner, bassist Matt Nyce, and Ramm deliver a strong blueprint for the new Hardly Art offshoot End of Time Records. (<i>Repeat</i> is the label's inaugural release.) And in small bites, it's a fun record delivered with a tinge of cynicism and a familiar hue of West Coast punk. But even with song lengths topping out at 2.5 minutes, Wimps don't really do ""small bites."" It's an album where the songwriting and hooks aren't quite strong enough for these tracks to be as repetitive as they are.</p>
<p>""Wet Cardboard"", for one, is a clever idea bogged down by repetitive shout-singing. The titular image is used as an analogy for a miserable person's emotional state-- heavy, cold, wet, moldy. And Ratner sounds satisfied about it, as she bitingly shouts, ""You'll never be dry again."" But while it's a clever idea, it's the hardest track on the album to see through. A faster song might be able to sustain three repetitive verses and a bridge, but the tempo drags and the shouted vocals eventually start to grate. Some of their lyrics don't wear well, either. The ""Stop Having Fun"" line ""it's that time of the month for you to shut up"" feels particularly hard to stomach with repeated listens.</p>
<p>But it's a fine line, as the band's repetition and brattiness occasionally work in their favor. ""Nap"" is the album's easy high point. The lyrics encompass <i>Repeat</i>'s overall vibe in the simplest terms possible: I don't want to go out or have fun or socialize; I just want to go to sleep. (Or more accurately, ""Naaaaaaaaap!"") Their loud, fast, catchy hook is strong, and it's the song where they economize the most, picking up the tempo and skipping a third verse altogether. Ultimately, a track like this one would sound awesome on the A-side of a 7"". And sometimes, they manage to balance their songs pretty well-- ""Quit Your Job"" packs enough complementary-but-contrasting elements into two minutes to keep the central hook from outstaying its welcome. But those are two examples, and really, their thematic territory, delivery, and sardonic viewpoint are too samey over 12 tracks.</p></div>"|17594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17594-repeat/|6.0|Evan Minsker

They want to play arenas, and fill those arenas with punishingly loud and hooky guitar riffs and righteous, octopus-arm drum fills that roll over enormous crowds like a monster truck assaulting a line-up of hollowed-out Chevy Malibus. The Joy Formidable have already done this as an opening act for other bands-- most notably Muse during last fall's tour in support of the ridiculous <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17281-the-2nd-law/"" target=""_blank"">The 2nd Law</a>-- </i>but they burn with headliner envy. It's incredible to see the Joy Formidable take that envy, turn it into pure energy, and shoot it out as a pulverizing Death Star ray in a small club.</p>
<p>The band's 2011 full-length debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15160-the-big-roar/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Big Roar </i></a>is exciting, slickly packaged entertainment more akin to a big-budget action blockbuster like <i>Skyfall </i>than anything currently in vogue in the insular, down-sized world of indie rock. <i>Roar</i>'s breakout song ""Whirring"" became a genuine hit on rock radio, and it's a whizz-bang distillation of the Joy Formidable's strengths: Singer Ritzy Bryan's whisper-to-a-scream vocal chops, the collision of instrumental force and melodic finesse, the energetic update of the most muscular forms of 90s shoegaze (specifically <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12846-raise-mezcal-head/"" target=""_blank"">Mezcal Head</a>­</i>-era Swervedriver and Ride's ""Leave Them All Behind""), and an underlying confidence that this music deserves to close out large outdoor festivals around the world.</p>
<p>Looked at more cynically, <i>The Big Roar </i>comes off like it was-- in the words of Pitchfork's Stuart Berman-- ""scientifically engineered to make the Joy Formidable sound like the Biggest Band in the World."" <i>The Big Roar </i>certainly was assembled, not by men in white coats, but by industry people who shepherded the band through years of refining the album's songs. One of <i>Roar'</i>s best tracks, ""Austere"", dates back to 2008; other songs appeared on previously released EPs in different versions before given a final polish.</p>
<p>The Joy Formidable's sophomore effort <i>Wolf’s Law </i>arrives without the benefit of multiple rough drafts. And yet <i>Wolf's Law</i> sounds like it's been worked over even more extensively, though not necessarily in a way that makes it more commercial. If anything, <i>Wolf's Law </i>is a weirder, proggier record that explores a wider range of textures and sounds than the relatively monochromatic <i>Roar. </i>The shifting time signatures of the Zeppelinesque ""Cholla"" and the swaggering ""Maw Maw Song""-- which alternates between verses that move stealthily along a rapid metallic pulse and a chorus that stomps about with bombastic insolence-- position the Joy Formidable as the heir to Muse's grandiose arena empire.</p>
<p>Not that the Joy Formidable is as insane as Muse, because no contemporary rock band<i> </i>is as insane as Muse. But they are clearly thinking in bolder and broader terms. The songs that hew closest to the first album’s blueprint-- like ""Tendons"" or the excellent, New Order-like single ""This Ladder is Ours""-- are the most successful, though the penultimate track ""The Hurdle"" shows an improved mastery of rock-song dynamics, building from a mesmerizing strum to an overwhelming, heart-pumping climax. Most Joy Formidable songs start at heart-pumping and turn up the volume from there, but on the delicate ""Silent Treatment"", Bryan is able to convey that same intensity backed only with an acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>It would be an exaggeration to call <i>Wolf's Law </i>the Joy Formidable's ""experimental"" record, but it does stretch (and occasionally overstretch) the band’s formula a bit. The operatic, <i>Days of Future Passed </i>orchestrations of ""The Turnaround"" are a little much, as are the electronic squiggles shot like laser blasts through the surly ""Bats"". Nearly a third of ""Maw Maw Song"" is an extended, exceedingly noodly guitar solo that approximates the sound of a robot dolphin pleasuring itself with a light saber.</p>
<p>No matter the occasional excesses, the Joy Formidable's saving grace is its songwriting: ""This Ladder is Ours"" is composed of at least two great hooks-- the irresistibly melodic bassline and Bryan’s declarative chorus-- that fly out of the speakers like anonymous henchmen tossed off of a speeding train. The Joy Formidable might not have the most plausible ambitions for a 21st century rock band. But <i>Wolf's Law </i>offers enough thrills to suspend your disbelief.</p></div>"|17550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17550-wolfs-law/|7.2|Steven Hyden

If this voice appeared on a 3am voicemail, your blood would freeze. Like its owner, it fairly lunges to be heard.</p>
<p>Scott, a 22-year-old from Nashville, records as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30970-torres/"" target=""_blank"">Torres</a>. This is her first album. She recorded it mostly in single live-band takes, close-mic'ed, and many of the album's 10 stark, stunning songs are set for nothing more than a single electric guitar. The lyrics are full of tricky, messy subject matter-- loaded poses of female need, abjection, subjugation, dominance-- and Scott handles it deftly, furtively, like hot stones slipped from palm to palm, or a lighter flicked under a wrist. Her sure touch with these explosive subjects immediately puts her in the league of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"" target=""_blank"">PJ Harvey</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29348-ema/"" target=""_blank"">EMA</a>. Like them, she paints in whole-hand smears when the moment calls for it. Her ability to capture and sustain a single a spellbinding mood conjures the hypnotic hurt of the earliest, best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26175-songs-ohia/"" target=""_blank"">Songs:Ohia</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"" target=""_blank"">Cat Power</a>. Her record is an overwhelming rush of feeling, and it connects with throat-seizing immediacy.</p>
<p>""Honey, while you were ashing in your coffee/ I was thinking of telling you've what you done to me,"" she murmurs on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14711-honey/"" target=""_blank"">Honey</a>"", over three muted implications of power chords. It feels like a depiction of a long-unhappily married couple, maybe, confined to a pair of armchairs, the woman silently glaring a hole in the man's oblivious head. The bass in Scott's voice deepens as the guitar flares, but the song never crosses over from ""thinking of telling"" to catharsis. ""Everything hurts, but its fine, it's fine/ it happens all the time,"" she mutters; the woman remains rigid in her chair, teeth clenched, leaving claw marks on the arm rests. Often on <i>Torres</i><span>, Scott plays a coiled, hurt figure willing herself to find the courage to transform into a 50 Ft Queenie, and not quite succeeding.</span></p>
<p>The songs on <span>Torres</span><span>, accordingly, are not anthems. Scott recorded the album with minimal resources-- a touch of keyboard here, a cello stab there-- and the skeletal backing band feels less like an unfortunate imitation than the album's single best decision. Songs build and build and build and then die, gazing longingly at exhilarating emotional peaks just outside their reach. Like the woman in ""Honey"", they would explode, if only they had a little help.</span></p>
<p>The feeling is echoed everywhere in the lyrics, which take baleful stock of emotional wreckage like so many groceries strewn open on the lawn. ""Moon &amp; Back” is addressed from a mother to a baby she gave up: ""I'm writing to you from 1991, the year I gave you to a mama with a girl and a son,"" she croons. Check the year and do the math; this isn't Scott’s baby, but this feels like her story nonetheless. ""Little baby, if you're reading this/ You're probably all grown, the way most babies do/ I'm sure your eyes are still that pretty blue,"" she sings, and by the time the song reaches its emotional center-- ""Your new family knows/ I did this all for you/ maybe one day, you'll believe them too""-- the song has has joined the Pretenders' ""Kid"" in a devastating lineage of songs: in which beleaguered moms sadly explain the inexplicable to their children.</p>
<p>The songs veer between rangy indie rock and hushed folk, unspooling in unhurried five and -six-minute lengths. They never insist on their structure, but eventually it becomes clear that they dip and surge at odd, intuitive moments, suggesting a creative songwriting mind. The music on ""Chains"" is little more than a single, baleful groan of cello, while scraped guitar strings that feel like ligaments tearing ratchets up tension in the background. The song drops off into a muffled-heartbeat blankness of a drum thud; Scott murmurs ""Don't give up on me just yet,"" her voice hooded. The moment hangs, and you wait for the curtain to drop. It doesn't; the end comes two minutes later in a rude snip of the tape that startles me even at the tenth hearing. The mesmerizing lamp-glow of finger-picked guitar that opens ""November Baby"" could have shown up on an early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Modest Mouse</a> record. It is supported by nothing more than a handful of bass guitar notes, and each one hits at a moment of such breath-held sustained tension that it taps you in the solar plexus.</p>
<p>Corralling all of this is Scott's jugular-direct, impressionistic writing. She reels off gorgeous images like this one, which opens ""November Baby"": ""His skin hangs on me like a lampshade/ keeping all my light at bay."" Natural images fill her lyrics-- trees, rocks, seasons-- but they are subject to the same disappointments and rejections as the human world: on ""When Winter's Over"", leaves drop wearily off of sorrowful trees. On the closer ""Waterfall"", Scott eyes the ceaselessly tumbling water and sees suicide: ""The rocks beneath they bare their teeth/ They all conspire to set me free/ I set my teeth and contemplate/ All the possibilities,"" she sings. The album fades out right before a Big Leap, fading out in a hum rather than a burst. As the tremolo'd guitar behind her dissolves into a fine mist, she either has or hasn't jumped, permamently suspended between doubt and release: ""Do you ever make it halfway down and think 'god, I never meant to jump at all'?""</p></div>"|17558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17558-torres/|8.1|Jayson Greene

To observe the inclusive aspirations of his rhythmically twisted indie pop, one need not actually listen at all. Rather, simply read the dossier for his decade-plus of output: Two album titles are in Portuguese, while another references the birthplace of Mozart, the Austrian city of Salzburg. He's named pieces for reindeer, linked them to nocturnal Asian dalliances, and borrowed from rudimentary Hebrew. Japanese electronics heavyweight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4167-nobukazu-takemura/"" target=""_blank"">Nobukazu Takemura</a> has remixed his work, as have Norwegian designer Kim Hiorthøy and wunderkind/manchild <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"" target=""_blank"">Jim O'Rourke</a>. For several albums, Mice Parade even employed Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir, the pixie-voiced singer of Iceland’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2865-mum/"" target=""_blank"">Múm</a>, as a muse; for Mice Parade's most recent two records, Pierce instead chose the diminutive coo of Japanese-American songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/971-caroline/"" target=""_blank"">Caroline Lufkin</a>. Mice Parade, for better and worse, is a sort of living music-as-the-universal-language manifesto.</p>
<p>Mice Parade's latest, <i>Candela</i>, once again surveys world music through a bracing indie pop filter, played by the busy (and occasionally brilliant) drummer and multi-instrumentalist Pierce and a half-dozen guests. It’s named for a flamenco favorite in Madrid where, as <a href=""http://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/madrid/entertainment-nightlife/bar/candela"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Lonely Planet</i></a> puts it, the city’s “young performers hang out downstairs in an informal bar where spontaneous music often breaks out late in the evening.” Within these 10 tracks, Pierce toys with Afropop and Afrobeat, flamenco guitar and singing, samba and gamelan, Appalachian folk rearrangements and icy European electronic ambience. Perhaps more than ever, though, the constituent pieces of Pierce's polyglot approach show their seams, with the multicultural touchstones often at unflattering odds with Pierce's more assured bedrock. In a desperate effort to prove worldly erudition, Mice Parade has forsaken the overall effect and strength of its songs.</p>
<p>Indeed, the tunes on <i>Candela</i> work best when they limit the number of themes they explore. <i>Candela</i> certainly starts with that understanding: During opener ""Listen Hear Glide Dear"", Pierce quietly pleads between tremolo guitars that fan over him and distant drums that rupture like distant roman candles. ""Currents"", the best song on the album, follows with similarly austerity. In typical Mice Parade fashion, the song conjoins several influences, from the music-box keyboard melody that introduces Lufkin and her gorgeously controlled voice to the rhythm section's aggressive African sizzle and the neon guitar solo that monopolizes the middle. But all of these elements conspire wonderfully for four minutes, registering an urgent and complex pop tune. These songs aren't short on ideas or influences; they simply funnel every piece toward one aim, strengthening the experience rather than distracting from it. </p>
<p>More often than not, however, Mice Parade pushes these songs down paths that don't fit. For instance, ""Contessa"" moves with the basic rhythm and melancholy of an antediluvian folk number such as ""The House Carpenter"". Its simplicity is its charm. But it ends with an organ jazz vamp, unnecessarily complicating a tune that can't support such accessories. ""This River Has a Tide"" opens and ends with Pierce moaning woozily over a grinding electric guitar, but the band swivels into a somber acoustic midsection, with Lufkin cooing through a bridge that the song never needed to cross. And ""Pretending"" hangs on one of the best hooks Pierce has ever written. Big drums radiate behind bigger guitars, tucked behind bold harmonies. But during the verses of the loquacious duet, his drums can't sit still, shifting the beats like he's scared of settling into the meter. Those disparate parts beset one another, resulting in an almost-great song that's nearly unlistenable.         </p>
<p><i>Candela </i>stumbles the most when it serves as an uncertain tour guide. The otherwise meek break-up tune ""Las Gentes Interesantes"" skips into an unexpected samba groove twice, adding stylistically accurate but entirely awkward trumpet, piano, and percussion during the second pass. Above nylon-stringed guitar, title track ""Candela"" relays Pierce's romantic travelogue through Spain, where a lover leaves Madrid to meet him in Barcelona after a navigational hiccup. It's a sweet tale and, especially for Pierce, poignantly written. But after four short verses, New York flamenco singer Gisele Saad Assi cuts in, airing her grievances as the beat doubles down for no reason other than to stretch the song toward a slow fadeout. Both tracks feel like unfortunate tourism, where an exotica fascination overpowers allegiance to the tune. ""Candela"" could have lasted 90 seconds, for instance, and been a simple, bittersweet love story. As is, it's nearly reason enough to give up on the album that takes its name.     </p></div>"|17514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17514-candela/|4.8|Grayson Currin

His last full-length, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15243-you-stand-uncertain/"" target=""_blank""><i>You Stand Uncertain</i></a> was exactly that. While there were flickers of sure blue sky, most notably on ""Waited Patiently"", for the most part it remained thick with ambivalent cloud, caught somewhere in between. Not that in-between is a bad place to be per se, as Lustman knows its fertile possibilities better than most. He's made a career out of flitting between house and garage, flirting with dub and techno, frequently led by his searching, experimental jazz background-- he was reared on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"" target=""_blank"">Miles Davis</a> and played in a jazz quartet as a teenager.</p>
<p>With new album, <i>Hardcourage</i>, Lustman's called it again. It maps his journey from uncertainty to confidence, toward music that reaches outward rather than inward; those two words pushed together as if to boldly ring the fact that facing your fears is no walk in the park. On <i>Hardcourage</i>, it appears he's worked hard to loosen his thrall to jazz-like introspection-- something that often eclipsed his earlier work-- in favor of a newfound openness. And what's come with that hard-won courage is a sense of fun. This is a sure-footed, big-hearted record; one that twirls and spins and delights in itself.</p>
<p>From the opening tiptoeing robot tones of ""Stay I'm Changed"", a playfulness runs through <i>Hardcourage</i>: it wiggles in the winking funk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14357-straight-arrow-four-tet-remix/"" target=""_blank"">""Straight &amp; Arrow""</a>, belly-laughs at the parrot-like squawk that swoops through the low-end jungle of ""Korben Dallas"", and leaps on the tap-dancing keys-- all lit up like that scene in <i>Big-</i>- of choral-infused, dub ballad ""Re Assimilate"". <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14783-she-sleeps-gang-gang-dance-remix/"" target=""_blank"">""She Sleeps""</a> ia a joy-filled shuffling house number that's as close to pop as Lustman's ever got, thanks to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26767-friendly-fires/"" target=""_blank"">Friendly Fires</a> frontman Ed Macfarlane's vocal turn. It's refreshing to hear a male voice emoting over Lustman's beats for once, rather than abstract fragments of female singing.</p>
<p>While Lustman has indicated that this is an album born in part from a new relationship (the two faces that adorn the front and back of the album artwork confirm it), <i>Hardcourage</i> also reads like loving dialogue with his contemporaries over in the UK: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28145-floating-points/"" target=""_blank"">Floating Points</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28121-gold-panda/"" target=""_blank"">Gold Panda</a> (the latter two have both contributed remixes to this record). Like Lustman, these are artists who have long drawn their strength from deep within the Venn diagram that is the UK electronic music scene.</p>
<p>So we have the blooming ""Uncea"", a carnival of soft synths bursting forth, tripping over finger clicks and melting into a gossamer dream of a house track. Evoking fond memories of DJ Rolando's Los Hermanos side project, ""For Karme"" moves into melodic techno territory with its click-click-whirring cog-like snares that fall back to let the keys breathe. That breathing space is crucial to the strength of <i>Hardcourage</i>. Where his jazz instinct had, in the past, led to the construction of immersive grooves that drown thought in feeling, the two live side by side on <i>Hardcourage</i>, and that's largely down to the generous sense of space. Percussive elements are allowed to stand alone, savored for their own intrinsic merit.</p>
<p>As if to highlight his progress, next come a pair of tracks that would have sounded at home on any of his previous records: ""Finally Some Shit / The Rain Stopped"" with its looping, wooden shaker groove, and ""Kenny Rolls One"" which, as indicated by the title, does get a little lost in its own moment of focused distraction, throwing up a number of threads that never really come together. But then ""Korben Dallas"" snaps into view and we're back in the room: a sharp, mischievous track that dances knowingly into noise techno's shade.</p>
<p><i>Hardcourage</i>'s crowning glory, and it knows it, is ""Bells"": its titular chimes part for soaring saxophone wails, wistful harmonica chirps, and babbling glockenspiel bubbles, and all seems right in the world. Lustman steers clear of turning saccharine, however, avoiding the obvious with his trademark teasing approach to pace; that push/pull thing, where you think the track's going one way but-- <i>oh!</i>-- it's actually skipping over there. It sounds like like a lot of learning and a lot of loving went into this album, and the result is FaltyDL at his most open. In the past his fluidity has been presented as growing pains, but now it only feels prophetic: This is what we once called electronica all grown up, unafraid to go wherever its heart takes it.</p></div>"|17556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17556-hardcourage/|7.8|Ruth Saxelby

Mat Sweet whispered his vocals and the songs were devotionally paced, but in their unremitting, medieval bleakness, there was a hint of metal: If Phil Elverum's love of black metal were more palpable in his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2919-mount-eerie/"" target=""_blank"">Mount Eerie</a> records, they might sound more like Sweet's work as Boduf Songs. Not coincidentally, Sweet has worked in harder, noisier climates: His crawling doom metal work in Map of Hell or his Mogwai-reminiscent post-rock outfit Four Man Ghost, both on his own label Blue Baby Recordings, testify to a lifelong membership to that society. But Boduf Songs, save for a few light, menacing drones, has always been a space for contemplation. These were songs that a member of the<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_Watch"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span> Night's Watch</span></a><span> might hum to himself to keep warm as he crunches through the snow north of <i>The Wall</i>. All of Sweet’s spellbinding releases as Boduf Songs were of this one, grey piece.</span></p>
<p>On <span><i>Burnt Up on Re-Entry</i>, </span><span>Sweet's latest as Boduf Songs, it's immediately clear that something different is happening. The album title evokes an object hurtling its way to the Earth, and the opening sound follows suit: The first thing you hear is a gargling, wheedling electronic shriek, like a mechanical valkyrie diving for your eyeballs. Sweet is still whispering, but it's a menacing stage whisper now of the ""we have your wife and children"" variety. The song, ""Fiery the Angels Fell"", concludes with with a conflagration of guitars, while a twitching wire of a drum track tweezers your nerve endings. Electronic locusts chitter, and Sweet sings, repeatedly, ""Hallelujah, we laid them with the rest."" The Visigoths have raided the temple.</span></p>
<p>To hear the implied metal break out onto the surface of the Boduf Songs project is a thrilling moment; it consummates four album's worth of gathering menace. ""Everyone Will Let You Down In the End"" lurches in its final minutes into a La Brea tarpit of down-tuned doom guitars. But the best and most rewarding additions to the landscape are the electronic elements: Throughout <i>Burnt Up</i>, the processed sounds that used to drift miles past in the background press their leering faces right up to the window. As ""Song to Keep Me Still"" builds to its climax, the distant sonar ping that starts out as a ghostly presence sprouts fangs and threatens to overwhelm the song. ""Whither Thou Goest, Cretin"" opens on a blankly firing piston of a beat, like a copy machine whirring away in the next room. Electro bubbles travel like quicksilver up its rigid backbone, and the song locks into a rigor-mortis dance-pop groove reminiscent of <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i>. ""Long Divider"" opens with a Casio bump not far away from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"" target=""_blank"">Leonard Cohen</a>'s ""I'm Your Man"".</p>
<p>Sweet still has a tendency to over-smear the stage blood in his lyrics-- at one point, he actually sings ""We'll grind your bones to make our bread."" But his vocals are warmer than usual, and even allow some outbreaks of multiplart harmony, warm pockets furtively stirred into the cold. ""Maggot Ending"", despite its title, might be the most calming, beatific song Sweet has written. The album ends on another bleak landscape, a collage piece of digital swarms, beeps, subterranean thumps, and no human life. It sounds like the final transmission retrieved from the titular burnt-up spacecraft. It's despairing and unfriendly, but it opens up an entire new world for Sweet to explore, and is richest and most surprising Boduf release yet.</p></div>"|17566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17566-burnt-up-on-re-entry/|7.4|Jayson Greene

The 100-ton iron horse clacking at 55 miles per hour through the tunnel to nowhere. Stainless steel cars bombed with balloon letters in bubble gum paint. The F Line, pre-Giuliani, packed with rats and villains, foreigners and flummoxed out-of-towners, beggars, bandits, and sweating working stiffs. Third rails everywhere. It stops at 21st street. Queensbridge exit.</p>
<p>The doors crumple open and the passengers vanish up half-lit stairwells into the Bridge. There is no <i>Illmatic</i> without the Bridge. <i>Illmati</i>c is the bridge. Queensbridge Houses, the largest projects in America, brick buildings dun as dead leaves, a six-block maze clotted with 7,000-plus trying to survive. The pissy elevators only stop on every other floor. The neighbors are the rotting East River and the ""Big Alice"" power plant, its smokestacks hacking up black clouds.</p>
<p>The Bridge is where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas/"" target=""_blank"">Nas</a> was raised. He explained the mentality to <i>The Source</i> in April 1994, the same month <i>Illmatic</i> was instantly canonized with a perfect 5-Mic score: ""When I was a kid I just stayed in the projects… that shit is like a city. Everybody's mentality revolves around the projects. Everybody's gotta eat. It's just the attitude out there, it's just life. You can't be no sucker.""</p>
<p><i>Illmatic</i> starts with that rumbling of the train. A VHS snippet from <i>Wild Style</i> immediately snarls, <i>""Stop fucking around and be a man!""</i> You hear a cassette tape hissing the verse from teenaged Nasty Nas on Main Source's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mppf1xhSh6E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Live at the BBQ</a>,"" 1991: ""<i>When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing</i><b> </b><i>Jesus.</i>"" He anointed himself the ""street's disciple."" Everyone blessed him as the Golden Child.</p>
<p>The track shifts to ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K89RsUzDu-U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Subway Theme</a>"" from <i>Wild Style</i>, hip-hop's first creation myth, the 1983 film that exposed the routines of the South Bronx to the rest of the world. Nas calls his version ""The Genesis"", fusing his own story of origin with the culture. </p>
<p>His brother Jungle snaps, ""yo, Nas, what the fuck is this bullshit?"" Nas tells him to chill. He's carrying on tradition, defined as: ""When it's real, you do it even without a recording contract."" It's an oath of purity amidst poisons-- something that seems sanctimonious in a post-Puffy world, but it assured the older gods that they would have a stake in the next generation. He was the spawn of the <i>Wild Style</i>, the first great to grow up with Park Jams as his earliest memories.</p>
<p><b><i>I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times.</i></b></p>
<p>Hip-hop was a teenager when <i>Illmatic </i>dropped<i>. </i>Old enough for biblical foundation, but young enough to be embroiled in an early identity crisis. The Columbia press sheet that accompanies it opens: ""While it's sad that there's so much frontin' in the rap world today, this should only make us sit up and pay attention when a rapper comes along who's not about milking the latest trend and running off with the loot.""</p>
<p>New York street culture was losing its birthright to hip-hop's evolution. Death Row and West Coast gangsta rap dominated the charts and mass media oxygen. Rap-A-Lot was carving up its empire in the South. It was after Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer, and leather-suited rappers wanted that <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Secret of the Ooze</i> money. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7623-big-daddy-kane/"" target=""_blank"">Big Daddy Kane</a> was firmly in the silken post-Madonna <i>Sex</i> book era. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10584-ll-cool-j/"" target=""_blank"">LL Cool J</a> was mugging with a red beret in <i>Toys</i>. Even a young <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"" target=""_blank"">RZA</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1812-gza/"" target=""_blank"">GZA</a> got bamboozled into goofy New Jack Swing jams by clueless executives. And Nas couldn't get a record deal.</p>
<p>This sounds insane in hindsight. When people start making greatest rapper lists you can't count to five before Nas' name is mentioned. The kid who went to hell for snuffing Jesus has become a sacred cow. <i></i>Twenty years deep, he's nominated for a Grammy and is in <a href=""http://youtu.be/rrpH2-gv8zM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gap ads</a> with his dad. There was the album with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2971-damian-marley/"" target=""_blank"">Damian Marley</a>, the feud with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z</a>, there was <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belly_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Belly</a>.</i> Nas is firmly entrenched in VH1 Special territory. He has crossed over enough without ever making radio hits, save for ""Oochie Wally"", in which he is out-rapped by his bodyguard-- all for oochie.</p>
<p>But Def Jam's Russell Simmons passed on the demo, famously claiming that Nas sounded too much like Queensbridge machine gun, Kool G Rap. Translation: great but unsalable. He signed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29155-warren-g/"" target=""_blank"">Warren G</a> instead, who went triple platinum in the summer and fall of 1994. <i>Illmatic</i> only sold 330,000 copies in its first year. It has no ""Regulate"" that can inspire drunken <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10608-nate-dogg/"" target=""_blank"">Nate Dogg</a> sing-a-longs, but it is widely regarded as the greatest East Coast rap album ever made. <i>Illmatic</i> is the gold standard that boom-bap connoisseurs refer to in the same way that Baby Boomers talk about <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i>. The evidence they point to when they want to say: this is how good it can be.</p>
<p><b><i>I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death. </i></b></p>
<p>The enduring vision of Nas: a baby-faced Buddha monk in public housing, scribbling lotto dreams and grim reaper nightmares in dollar notebooks, words enjambed in the margins. The only light is the orange glow of a blunt, bodega liquor, and the adolescent rush of first creation. Sometimes his pen taps the paper and his brain blanks. In the next sentence, he remembers dark streets and the noose.</p>
<p>The phrases and images are so deeply rooted in rap consciousness to have become cliché. Over the last 19 years, a million secret handshakes and scratched hooks have been executed to lines from <i>Illmatic</i>: I woke up early on my born day; I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi 'til I'm charged; you couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer, that's like Malcolm X catching jungle fever; I'm an addict for sneakers, twenties of Buddha, and bitches with beepers; vocabulary spills, I'm ill; life's a bitch and then you die.</p>
<p>Removed from context, they seem unremarkable. When spit with criminal smoothness over beat breaks, they became iconic. If <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3519-rakim/"" target=""_blank"">Rakim</a> was rap's Woody Guthrie, Nas was the Dylan figure expanding the possibilities and complexity of the form, twisting old fables to match contemporary failings, faithful to tradition but unwilling to submit to orthodoxy.</p>
<p><i>Illmatic</i> was the bridge. Melle Mel and Kurtis Blow, to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3617-run-dmc/"" target=""_blank"">Run-DMC</a>, to Rakim, the Juice Crew, and Big Daddy Kane. Now Nas. Everyone said he had next since Large Professor brought the chipped tooth kid sporting Gazelles into the studio. His arrival was a communal effort. After MC Serch discovered he was unsigned, he landed him a deal at Columbia Records. When Nas summoned beats, he was laced with jewels from the city's best producers: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Premier</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3631-pete-rock/"" target=""_blank"">Pete Rock</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2430-large-professor/"" target=""_blank"">the Large Professor</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3499-q-tip/"" target=""_blank"">Q-Tip</a>.</p>
<p>Regional demand was so high that Serch claimed he discovered a garage with 60,000 bootlegged copies. The brief length (10 tracks, 39:51) was due to this rush to get to market. It also left less room for error. There are many albums with higher highs than <i>Illmatic,</i> but none with fewer flaws. The sequencing is perfect down to ""Halftime"" ending as the cassette tape clicked. It's as dense and claustrophobic as Queensbridge, but blood simple. The verses sprint around blind corners and the hooks are hypnotic chants: New York State of Mind, One Love, It's Half Time, The World is Yours, Coming Out of Queensbridge, Represent.</p>
<p>A classic album is supposed to change or define its time. <i>Illmatic</i> did both. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big/"" target=""_blank"">Notorious B.I.G.</a> borrowed everything from art ideas to album structure. It was so blatant that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3634-raekwon/"" target=""_blank"">Raekwon</a> dedicated an <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx3xcDmJ9dE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">entire skit</a> to mocking it. Jay-Z took a hot Nas line and made a hot song on <i>Reasonable Doubt.</i> If you listen to Sean Carter before <i>Illmatic</i>, the rat-a-tat is straight from Big Daddy Kane. After Nas dropped, Jay-Z suddenly got smooth. Those are just the two most famous appropriations.</p>
<p>No album better reflected the sound and style of New York, 94. The alembic of soul jazz samples, SP-1200s, broken nose breaks, and raw rap distilled the Henny, no chaser ideal of boom-bap. The loops rummage through their parent's collection: Donald Byrd, Joe Chambers, Ahmad Jamal, Parliament, Michael Jackson. Nas invites his rolling stone father, Olu Dara to blow the trumpet coda on ""Life's A Bitch"". Jazz-rap fusion had been done well prior, but rarely with such subtlety. Nas didn't need to make the connection explicit-- he allowed you to understand what jazz was like the first time your parents and grandparents heard it.</p>
<p><b><i>I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane.</i></b> </p>
<p>None of this context has to matter. <i>Illmatic</i> is imprisoned within itself. The power is targeted in the narrow scope of its worldview. There are six desperate and savage blocks and there is nowhere else. Nas captures the feeling of being young and trapped. You see his struggle and you see his ghosts.</p>
<p>The more I listen to <i>Illmatic,</i> the more haunted it feels. When you're younger, it clubs you with its hail of words and the skeletal beauty of its beats. But the older I get, the more it strikes me as a teenaged requiem for those still living. ""Old Soul"" is the sort of stock phrase used by yoga teachers and amateur psychics, but it always fit Nas. He's 20 and prematurely nostalgic, struck by memories of park jams and watching ""CHiPS."", when Shante dissed the real Roxanne, and how much he misses Mr. Magic.</p>
<p>There is no narrative about Ill Will, but you hear the name over and over. Will was his best friend and first music partner who lived on the 6th floor with turntables and a mic. He was shot to death in Queensbridge over a drunken argument. You don't hear how Nas and his wounded brother Jungle rushed Will to the hospital, got static from emergency room officials, and watched him die. But the sense of grievous loss shadows almost every bar, especially ""Memory Lane"" and ""One Love"".</p>
<p>If you listen to it enough names start to pop out: Fatcat, Alpo, Grand Wizard, Mayo, the foul cop who shot Garcia, Jerome's niece, Little Rob, Herb, Ice, and Bullet. The entirety of ""Represent"". You start to wonder where they are now, or if they are. The album's lone guest AZ, lays it down flat: he's destined to live the dream for all the peeps who never made it. </p>
<p>But Nas uses <i>Illmatic</i> as more than a vehicle to escape. The styles and stories that formed him fuse into something that withstands outdated slang and popular taste: it is a story of a gifted writer born into squalor, trying to claw his way out of the trap. It's somewhere between <i>The Basketball Diaries</i> and <i>Native Son</i>, but Jim Carroll and Richard Wright couldn't rap like Nas.</p>
<p>That's why 19 years later, Get On Down is re-issuing a box set with a vinyl, gold CD, and an ersatz cherry wood case featuring a 48-page book with <i>The Source</i> article that originally crowned him-- even if <i>Illmatic </i>was the archetypal cassette album (along with<i> </i>the purple tape). It's best heard by ignoring the dogma, culture wars, Nas clones, and would-be saviors that have accreted since April of 1994. Who cares whether it's the greatest rap album of all-time or not? It's an example of how great rap can be, but not necessarily the way it should be.</p>
<p>There was no real follow-up to <i>Illmatic</i> because Nas understood that he'd tapped into a moment that could only come once and in one place. This is what things had been building towards. A little over a decade later, Nas claimed that hip-hop was dead, but this world that was his was already starting to vanish on <i>Illmatic</i>. But you can still summon it from the first rumble of the train. This is what happened when the doors opened.</p></div>"|17497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17497-illmatic/|10.0|Jeff Weiss

It's hard to dispute, since he spends the rest of ""Desert of Pop"" enumerating ways to relate the feeling: He's ""like a birthday boy, giddy and excited"" over someone or something that hits him like ""a single malt, pure agave tequila."" The good stuff, y'know? But there's one line that doesn't sit quite right: ""You are [a] cold glass of water in the desert of pop."" I'm almost positive he's referencing pop music, but he does leave open the slightest possibility that it's a reference to soda. It sounds farfetched, but while ""Desert of Pop"" clearly describes being struck dumb by a singer, a song, or a combination of the two, why would McPhun describe pop as an arid wasteland when the spiffy synth hits and hi-NRG dance beats make it abundantly clear that the Ruby Suns want you to view <i>Christopher </i>as their entry into splashy chart pop? Maybe they're not sure either, as <i>Christopher </i>dives in headfirst and just as quickly heads back to the surface.</p>
<p>Perhaps McPhun feels self-conscious about this change of heart, as he confesses about his situation, ""Anyone else would think I'm your cheerleader."" While becoming a pop evangelist relatively late in life can generally be healthy, at least as an acknowledgement that wholly rejecting pop music can be just as narrow-minded as wholly accepting it, it's particularly dangerous in the hands of musicians who haven't really shown much of an ear for it previously. Most often, it just results in enthusiastic overcompensation; you can look to fellow Indie Class of 2008 overachievers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5932-ra-ra-riot/"" target=""_blank"">Ra Ra Riot</a> neglecting nearly all of their strengths to go electronic on their new LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17513-beta-love/"" target=""_blank""><i>Beta Love</i></a>, and hopefully this can be the last time we ever have to mention <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30323-pop-etc/"" target=""_blank"">POP ETC</a>.</p>
<p>While <i>Christopher </i>undoubtedly comes on strong, the Ruby Suns sound undeniably invigorated here. For one thing, they end up discovering new strengths, as this kind of effusive sound fits McPhun's extroverted (and occasionally cloying) lyrics, and his vocals turn out to be more melodically inclined than he's let on to this point. It also gives the Ruby Suns a sense of direction that was previously missing from the sunny, island-hopping indie pop sampler of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11219-sea-lion/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sea Lion</i></a> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13969-fight-softly/"" target=""_blank"">Fight Softly</a></i>'s<i> </i>hesitant purveyance of post-chillwave synth murk. After McPhun's opening devotional, the equally headspun ""In Real Life"" elaborates on a lyric from ""Desert of Pop""-- and its sound as well, resulting in what feels like a smartly constructed medley. Having given himself over, McPhun admits, ""Real life wasn't what I wanted/ What I wanted was a waste of time,"" opting instead for an untenable existence where you drink the days away, completely free from the worries of money. Far more common than the getaways evoked on <i>Sea Lion</i>, yet the escapism is every bit as intoxicating.</p>
<p>But from there on out, McPhun gets real with us-- in particular, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14506-kingfisher-call-me/"" target=""_blank"">""Kingfisher Call Me""</a> shows empathy for a misunderstood friend suffering through what he calls a ""psychological high school."" The balance of <i>Christopher </i>is addressed to people suffering from very specific kinds of teen angst. ""Dramatikk"" resembles the starstruck and spangled balladry of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29170-autre-ne-veut/"" target=""_blank"">Autre Ne Veut</a>, and consoles a friend experiencing a breakup; as you could probably tell from the title ""Futon Fortress"", its narrator can't even get out of bed but appears to be okay with that. ""Boy"" is a pep talk (""Do you hide in your room/ Away from dad/ To revel in your baseball card collection?"") and also a quasi revenge fantasy, assuring a lonely kid that his foes ""will turn out losers in the end."" It reads embarrassing, but these are the sort of unruly feelings that Capital-P pop helps people understand and even appreciate.</p>
<p>Yet the Ruby Suns quickly lose their nerve and hooks about halfway through <i>Christopher</i>,<i> </i>and it simply becomes a brighter, albeit favorable, take on <i>Fight Softly</i>'s mushier innards, only roused by a strange key change during ""Starlight"" and when they bring out the defibrillators for the closer, ""Heart Attack"". The dissonance between the docile synth pop and unbridled urges maxes out on would-be cornerstone ""Jump In"". The title is once again a demonstrative one, as McPhun aspires to live a life free of fears and inhibitions, centering around the lyric, ""When you reach the end of the world/ Don't wanna have no regrets."" By the time it's over, he's asked about your underwear (really), got involved in a mutual striptease, written a letter to a crush, and sent it without proofreading. <i>Christopher</i> is certainly a welcome call to action from a band who could previously have been cast off as amiable roustabouts. The shame is that, from a musical standpoint, <i>Christopher </i>is too often a result of Ruby Suns failing to take their own advice.</p></div>"|17517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17517-christopher/|5.8|Ian Cohen

On her long-awaited second album, it's full-blown warfare. <i>Goldenheart </i>is the culmination of a fruitful few years for the former Danity Kane and Dirty Money singer: She helped to make Diddy's <i>Last Train to Paris</i> fascinating, released one of last year's most stunning R&amp;B records with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16486-armor-on-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Armor On </i></a>EP, and worked with Israeli house producer Guy Gerber. Since leaving Diddy's watchful eye in 2010, Richard has proven a fiercely independent force in a world dominated by name-dropping and endless collaboration. <i>Goldenheart </i>is the jewel in her crown.</p>
<p>Richard is the kind of artist who believes in statements, so naturally, she uses the album format as a vehicle for a 16-song, hour-plus opus about the trials of relationships. Real stuff: doubt, power struggles, insurmountable obstacles, and hopeless, life-saving devotion. Richard's subjects are simultaneously mundane and grandiose, transcending usual pop fluff and turning her deeply personal subjects into epic tales of battle and salvation. If that sounds like a bit much, well, it is. But Richard has the personality to prop it all up. Her voice is a ghostly wail halfway between a howl and modern R&amp;B melancholy, effortlessly melismatic (check the Bollywood flourishes on ""Return of a Queen""), and capable of making her complex melodies glisten like an iridescent oil slick. On ""Gleaux"", her processed voice shines as luminous as the sparkling stars the lyrics describe.</p>
<p>Her shimmering vocals are paired with appropriately futuristic-sounding production from close working partner Andrew ""Druski"" Scott: tight and impressive, yet rarely showy. She's always foregrounded, occasionally leaning on the drums for emphasis as on ""Tug of War"", (produced by the Fisticuffs), but more often using them as a canvas for her holographic paintings. And, as with most R&amp;B of the past half-decade, <i>Goldenheart </i>heavily incorporates dance music, though Richard's restrained aesthetic holds these tracks back from becoming overblown bangers; ""In Your Eyes"" folds in the cyan hues of trance without indulging the genre's excesses, resulting in an unusually smooth house track. Even Richard's inevitable attempt at dubstep strikes gold with ""Pretty Wicked Things"", a pounding industrial foray that literalizes the corruption and deception described in Dawn's lyrics. Though still landing on the more aggro side of the genre, her flirtation with dubstep is more natural than the pop industry's usual taste for the stuff.</p>
<p>Of course, all that ""restraint"" has an effect-- <i>Goldenheart </i>feels about twice as long as it really is. A collection of 16 mostly midtempo tracks is going to turn tepid any way you look at it. Once you learn your way around the record's labyrinthine path, it's an addictive world, but one that you're more likely to pick and choose highlights from than sit all the way through. If you can, however, it's a grand journey through personal trials and tribulations. Relationships and emotions are presented with striking sagacity-- the incredible ""Tug of War"" wraps up the conflicted quest for dominance at the expense of another's power in a strident four minutes. Richard's flair for theatricality is unparalleled, and almost exhausting by the end of the album, with at least three possible elegiac endings: the peaceful ""Ode To You"" and ""Break of Dawn"" both hint towards resolution.</p>
<p>In the intro to ""Warfaire,"" a hushed Richard mutters ""I fight a battle every day, against discouragement and fear... I must forever be on guard."" It's a little hammy, sure, but her earnest personality both endears and empowers her work. And <i>Goldenheart </i>is definitively, completely <i>her</i> work; no guest stars and no flashy producers, mostly her and Druski crafting her vision. It's not perfect, but it's closer than you'd expect from someone who just a few years ago was a member of a C-list girl group.</p></div>"|17619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17619-goldenheart/|7.3|Andrew Ryce

He responded with the assured and detailed <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16716-mysterious-phonk-the-chronicles-of-spaceghostpurrp/"">Mysterious Phonk: The Chronicles of SpaceGhostPurrp</a></i>, an album that found him inhabiting a smartly chosen array of styles, zoning in on concrete-colored street montages and further articulating his own bleak worldview. The hedonistic, violent lyrical free association that had colored early tapes like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15449-blvcklvnd-rvdix-666-1991/"">Blvcklvnd Rvdix 66.6 (1991)</a></i> and <i>Nasa the Mixtape</i> was exchanged for more focus, nuance, and space. Around the same time, SGP was also becoming tight with one of 2012's fastest rising rappers, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a>, with whom he collaborated to produce frequent A$AP set-opener, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12914-aap-rocky-pretty-flacko/"" target=""_blank"">Pretty Flacko</a>"". SGP is an unconventional, sinisterly-minded MC, to be sure, but he was becoming a small star on his own terms, aligning with folks angled upward, and business blossoming thanks to continued placement and allure of his hypnotic, druggy production.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Soon, Rocky and SpaceGhost's relationship disintegrated-- the reasons why depend on who you ask, but just witness the hardly-veiled menace in Rocky's ""Jodye""-- and SGP returned to his native Florida, re-engaging the music of his emergence with <i>B.M.W.</i>, an EP in name only, clocking in a hair shy of 50 minutes. Though SGP has never never broken too far from the droning, chorus-free stripper anthems of his earliest work, here he retreats fully into the world of his former nome de plume, Muney Jordan, snapping lines like, ""I gotta whole lotta ice/ I'm gonna take you wife"" over rattling, carsick production outfitted with 8-bit blips and samples of women moaning sexually.</p>
<p>Notably absent is the relative clear-mindedness of calculated, dark cult fare thoroughly referenced on <i>Chronicles</i>--  cuts like ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46451-video-spaceghostpurrp-the-black-god/"" target=""_blank"">The Black God</a>"", a track (and a visual aesthetic) that wouldn't feel out of place rolled up on an iconic Wu-Tang Clan solo release. While <i>B.M.W.</i> is filled with polished versions of some SpaceGhostPurrp's hallmarks-- the drugged-up soul sample on ""Cum &amp; Git Yuh Some,"" the venomous chants on ""Rep FLA (Flawda)""-- it's the work of an artist who isn't quite sure what he wants to say or how he wants to say it. The largely unnotable posse Raider Klan don't add much.</p>
<p>SpaceGhostPurrp is a hard guy to figure out and it seems like he's trying to keep it that way. The primer that accompanies the official download-- ""Instructions before listening to this EP : 1. Get yo weed 2. Get yo drank 3. Get yo pillz 4. Get yo coke 5. Get yo bitch 6. Get Phucked up 7. Then blast this shit ""-- jives with whatever message SGP is feeling at the moment; at one point, he raps ""I ain't a hypocrite but I ain't perfect/ There is a higher power / Man I used to be an atheist / Until God made me reminisce / That the faith is the key to self, I keep forgettin' it,"" but then immediately recedes into his default, desolate objectification. It all adds up to an uneven listen, to say the least. </p></div>"|17539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17539-bmw-ep/|5.4|Corban Goble

But 27-year old DJ <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30976-ben-ufo/"" target=""_blank"">Ben UFO</a> has done plenty for London's electronic underground just by being a selector. Alongside college friends and <a href=""http://www.hessleaudio.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hessle Audio</a> co-founders <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29526-pearson-sound/"" target=""_blank"">Pearson Sound</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28648-pangaea/"" target=""_blank"">Pangaea</a>, Ben Thomson was an early drum 'n bass turned dubstep enthusiast who encouraged the UK's quietly experimental take on the growing genre. He notes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22116-loefah/"" target=""_blank"">Loefah</a>'s ""Horror Show"" as an early influence, and, taking cues from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14226-digital-mystikz/"" target=""_blank"">Digital Mystikz</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22051-kode9/"" target=""_blank"">Kode9</a>'s Hyperdub imprint, and the newly garage-inflected sounds of a then-anonymous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>, Hessle Audio became a collective of DJs whose taste weighed as heavily as the quality of their releases.</p>
<p>It's refreshing to see any DJ for that matter being heralded as a tastemaker by taking chances on others. In a time where file-sharing and free releases make vaults of exclusive tracks that much more impressive, Thomson has inadvertently proved that the DJ's worth is one that can still be measured by the amount of trust his audience has put in him. As a result, his induction into Fabric's hall of fame of late night DJ heroes with <i>FabricLive 67</i> is unsurprising. Hessle has had a residency at the iconic club for years, and his Rinse FM radio slot mirrors those nights via podcast. During those shows, Thomson has championed the importance of actually interacting with his immediate environment-- filling the space of a room, moderating the heaviness of the sound, vibing with those around you-- and brings that same club-culture approach to his sets. There's an obsessive-compulsive tick that inevitably comes in hand; curating a crate, playing a track, assessing its impact, and understanding where to go next.</p>
<p>One can only imagine that his Fabric mix is reflective of those live sets as a result. His strength lies in emulating a club for headphone listening, balancing skirmish, goosebump-inducing drums with techno and garage accents that clatter and echo off of imaginary walls. Although speckled with Hessle releases, the mix relies on visiting corners of the British and American dance underground-- from knocking Croydon dubstep, the grittier side of acid house, Detroit and Chicago favorites, and cross-fusion touches of techno and funky. Mix Mup's ""Dub"" starts things off with a crawling anticipation before launching into the distorted, hi-hat-crunching havoc of L.I.E.S. affiliate Delroy Edwards. Where Pev &amp; Kowton's ""Raw Code"" combines their forces with minimal, unassuming melodies and stripped-down drums, the urgency remains in a tense bassline and carries our own anxieties along with it. </p>
<p>The points of climax here are as disparate in construct as they are emotionally volatile. Mr Fingers' ""I'm Strong"" is a hands-in-the-air deep house epic where the ghostly wailing vocals of Robert Owens is as hypnotic as the chain-gang clank behind Pangaea's ""Release""-- so much so that you can almost hear a chant of ""hey, hey"" in the warped noise sample that pushed the track forward. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29870-blawan/"" target=""_blank"">Blawan</a>'s ""And Both His Sons"" excavates the jittery, sinister undertones that stealthily lurk in the mix all along with his rampaging kick-drums and menacing growls. Elsewhere <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8811-shackleton/"" target=""_blank"">Shackleton</a> chops up the Congolese drums of Kasai Allstars with ""Mukuba Special"" before sucumbing to the bloated, drone-like synth pull of Kyle Hall and Kero's ""Zug Island"".</p>
<p>Thomson's art is in maintaining this wonderfully complex strung-out tension. In a <a href=""http://www.timeout.com/newyork/clubs/interview-and-dj-mix-ben-ufo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent interview</a> he explained his selection habits as one that naturally followed in line with the birth of early 4/4 London garage. (In the mid 90s, back-room rave and jungle DJs pitched up New York house records which ultimately led to beginner's 2-step.) Contextualizing older records like Herbert's 1996 gritty deep house banger ""Take Me Back"" or Minimal Man's 1993 acid classic ""Consexual"" with newer tangential stylings (Lowtec's ""Looser"", for example) makes this a process that's both educational and forward-thinking. And while other young UK-based electronic experimentalists like Floating Points make it onto the mix, Thomson's heavy label love is a reminder that he's constantly one step ahead of the game.</p></div>"|17553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17553-fabriclive-67/|7.8|Puja Patel

Who do we want to sound like? What are we going to call ourselves? These early triangulations often lead to everything else falling into place: bass lines, vocal affectations, guitar tones, production, album-art style. They say a lot about the band you intend to become. Sam France and Jonathan Rado, a duo from L.A., decided at some point that they would be called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30523-foxygen/"" target=""_blank"">Foxygen</a>. Yes, they were still in high school at the time. But when you pair that name with the unwieldy title <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/8-we-are-the-21st-century-ambassadors-of-peace-and-m/"" target=""_blank""><i>We Are The 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace and Magic</i></a>, you get a certain picture: goofily endearing, kid-brother types, the kind of guys who will probably embarrass you in public if you let them. Which makes the assured and witty <i>We Are</i> that much more surprising.</p>
<p>France and Rado have been playing together for years, and they've apparently spent that time working through their relationships to their record collections. Faced with the terrifying bounty of the rock menu on their 2012 EP <i>Take The Kids Off Broadway</i>, they seemingly shut their eyes and ordered everything at once: The songs stumbled through styles like there was a demented drill-sergeant producer in the background yelling, ""OK now, Memphis soul! Now, when I say, Merseybeat-era Beatles! GO!""</p>
<p><i>We Are</i>, by contrast, has more poise, rifling with effortless cool through retro-rock quotes and mannerisms-- France's gulps and sobs draw directly from the Mick Jagger of ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" at one moment and channel the thousand-ton boredom of Lou Reed the next. Meandering organ pokes through on ""No Destruction""; flecks of ""Under My Thumb""-style guitars pop up on ""On Blue Mountain"". In the lovely ""San Francisco"", France paints the city as a place where ""the forest meets the bridge,"" and the grass scent of the Kinks' <i>We Are the Village Green Preservation Society</i><span> wafts by (even their album title is an echo of that one). Having a great record collection and having some idea what to do with it are two different things, and on <i>W</i></span><i>e Are The Ambassadors</i><span> Foxygen have internalized enough of the music they love to start toying with it.</span></p>
<p>As you spend more time with <i>We Are</i><span>, you begin to notice</span><span> some of that playfulness manifesting itself, like the pitched-down vocals counting in the opening of ""On Blue Mountain"", a song that rattles through multiple tempo and key changes without seeming disjointed. The warbly ""Oh Yeah"" can't seem to decide what kind of homage it is, veering between a yearning </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Fantastic_and_the_Brown_Dirt_Cowboy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Captain Fantastic</span></a><span> falsetto chorus, Blood Sweat &amp; Tears symphonic soul, and an ""aww-yeah"" breakdown that is a near-direct quote of </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S46OE902tM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Mr. Big Stuff""</span></a><span>. The echoes are blurred further by producer Richard Swift, a talented singer-songwriter with a meticulous ear for period detail. He follows the band's songwriting cues wherever they lead, and </span><i>Ambassadors</i><span> seems to be reporting from  three simultaneous decades of rock history.</span></p>
<p>France, meanwhile, has become a sharp storyteller and lyricist, reeling off lines that feel like insults even if you can't parse them: ""I caught you sipping milkshakes in the parlor of the hotel,"" he yawns on ""No Destruction"", before delivering the piercingly direct (and already heavily quoted) stinger ""There's no need to be an asshole, you're not in Brooklyn anymore."" On ""Shuggie"", he sighs ""I met your daughter the other day, that was weird/ She had rhinoceros-shaped earrings in her ears,"" an arresting image that in context evokes an odd sense of sadness. The call-and-response chorus of ""San Francisco""--  ""I left my love in San Francisco/ (That's okay, I was born in L.A.)""-- hits like a joke even if the target isn't clear.</p>
<p><span>Slipped between the air quotes are proclamations that ring with personal truth: </span><span>""We can live on blue mountain like livin' in a sunset/ We can live honestly and true,"" goes the chorus to ""On Blue Mountain"". On ""Shuggie"", France sings ""If you believe in yourself, you can free your soul."" He sings it in a warbly, affected voice, pulling a face at the sentiment slightly, a trick he repeats at the album's coda, where he keens in an off-key choirboy voice:</span><span> ""If you believe in love/ Everything you see is love/ So try to be what God wants you to be/ And say that I love you/ Again."" It's one thing to give your band and your album a silly name, and to play dress-up with rock history while tweaking the formula. It's another thing entirely to mean it; the more time you spend with <i>Ambassadors</i>, the more clearly that commitment and joy comes through.  </span></p></div>"|17552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17552-we-are-the-21st-century-ambassadors-of-peace-magic/|8.4|Jayson Greene

Both outfits were led by Chicago scene vet Tim Rutili, both featured emerging producer Brian Deck as a band member and sonic mastermind, both offered broken-down and narcotic spins on blues and folk with evocative titles that played on the gritty imagery of machines (""To Hush a Sick Transmission"", ""Sad Cadillac""). For people who had followed Red Red Meat through the 90s, from their noisy early recordings that put them in league with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux/"" target=""_blank"">Royal Trux</a> through their supremely crafted, final two albums that found them in full studio-as-instrument mode, Califone felt very much like an extension of that main band. Eventually, Califone would explore more gentle and song-oriented material as well as delving into pure soundtrack work, and would develop their own idenity-- but during the time of their self-titled 1998 and 2000 EPs, they were pretty much a slightly lower-fi Red Red Meat.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That once-fuzzy line is blurred further on the vinyl reissue of <i>Sometimes Good Weather Follows Bad People</i>, a set that gathers Califone's first two EPs. Both were initially self-titled and issued on small labels (Flydaddy and Road Cone) and they were first gathered together under this title in 2002. So this is in a sense a reissue of a reissue, but this 2xLP edition of <i>Good Weather</i>, in addition to its fine packaging, adds potentially enticing extras on side four: 17 minutes of unreleased Red Red Meat material, culled from their final recording sessions. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The two EPs, spread across the first three sides, still sound great. Rutili and co. were up to something special in the final years of the 20th century. They took sonic inspiration from ancient folk 78s and Jamaican dub, along with songwriting and arrangement inspiration from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Waits</a>, and came up with a fresh and affecting music that ranged from ethereal slowcore to blistering noise. In comparison to late Red Red Meat, Califone was a little quieter, a little prettier, and a little wearier. The highlights on the EPs are delicate ballads like the steel drum-inflected ""Silvermine Pictures"" and the gorgeous piano-led ""Electric Fence"", but spikier cuts like ""To Hush a Sick Transmission"" and ""Dock Boggs"" showed how they integrated clangy percussion and electronics into the mix. The rawness of this early material still resonates.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">The four new songs on the final side, however, don't transcend ""bonus track"" status. ""Bath Water"" is a winding ballad with a reasonably catchy chorus hook, but it sounds like an ultra-simple and stripped down demo, something laid to tape just to preserve the basics of the song. ""June Rat"" is sung by Tim Hurley and feels like a sketch. The RRM version of ""Pastry Sharp"" is simple, highlighting the strong melody but missing from the atmosphere of Califone's studio version. The full-band take on ""A Horse-Sized Pill"" is the one song that seems like it could fit on a proper Red Red Meat album, though it's very similar to (and is seriously outclassed by) <i>Bunny Gets Paid</i>'s ""Rosewood, Stax, Volts and Glitter"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">As bonus material goes, it's all fine, and hardcore RRM/Califone completists (and let's face it, there aren't many of us out there) will appreciate the look at material in its formative stages. But most people will give that fourth side a single play at most. The first three, though, hold up nicely, capturing one small-scale and deceptively interesting band as it molted and emerged from another.</p></div>"|17330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17330-sometimes-good-weather-follows-bad-people/|8.0|Mark Richardson

But as you delve into the band's debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/12-true-hallucinations/"" target=""_blank""><i>True Hallucinations</i></a>, the alliance with Other Music starts to make more sense: Ex Cops approach their music as if they were friendly record-store clerks, using a familiar sound as a starting point before digging further back and helping you connect the dots to what came before it.</p>
<p>For the duo of Brian Harding and Amalie Bruun, home is found at the dream pop end of the indie rock spectrum, in the form recently re-popularized by fellow east coasters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28353-wild-nothing/"" target=""_blank"">Wild Nothing</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29923-dive/"" target=""_blank"">DIIV</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">the Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a>. You wouldn't know it from <i>True Hallucinations</i>' opening, ""S&amp;HSXX,"" a dark, synth-powered instrumental set to a rhythm track sampled from Genesis' mid-'80s hit, ""Mama"", that gets the album off to an incongruously icy, ominous beginning. But before long, the sugar-rush swoon of ""Ken"" and ""James"" provide an instant realignment of Ex Cops' aims, with boy/girl harmonies that waft in like a coastal breeze, and shimmering, jangling guitars that cast the songs' wide-eyed energy in a soft-focus blur. It's a mode that Ex Cops execute very well-- on first pass, there's little to immediately distinguish them from the myriad other bands carved from the late-80s Creation Records mould, but Harding and Bruun aren't shy about wielding their hooks, and pack a considerable amount of dynamic variation into a limited range.</p>
<p>Ex Cops become a more interesting, impressive band once they start straying further afield, however, tracing dream pop's evolution through the euphoric, pulse-quickening highs of <i>Feels</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a> (""Billy Pressly""), the laser-guided <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"" target=""_blank"">Spiritualized</a> sax surges of ""Jazz &amp; Information"", the locomotive Flying Nun-worthy whirr of ""Broken Chinese Chairz"", and the vintage 4AD flashback that is ""Separator"". (When the latter's beautifully melancholic riff cuts out during the second verse, leaving Harding and Bruun's airy sighs to hang above a brooding bassline, you get a sense of what the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"" target=""_blank"">Pixies</a>' ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" might sound like through the space-bound simian's ears.) Meanwhile, the knowingly titled ""Nico Beast"" takes us back to where this strung-out strain of rock 'n' roll all began-- i.e., <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hugY9CwhfzE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the corner of Lexington and 125</a>.</p>
<p>However, more than merely showcase Harding and Bruun's well-cultivated record collections, <i>True Hallucinations </i>is a testament to the duo's unfailingly snappy songcraft and how naturally it can adapt to different forms and settings; even the album's most languorous moment, the moonstruck ballad ""The Millionaire"", feels brisk and engaging, thanks to its wonderfully dazed central melody. Dream pop is an easy formula to replicate-- emit a breathy, androgynous coo; step on tremolo pedal-- but it's an awfully hard one to keep fresh, and remain on the right side of the line that separates blissful reverie and insomnia balm. Acid-trip allusions aside, <i>True Hallucinations</i> is ultimately a triumph of focus and discipline.</p></div>"|17502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17502-true-hallucinations/|7.8|Stuart Berman

On 2009's <i>Mystical Participation</i>, founding members (and spouses) Rob Garcia and Sarah Everton ran bubblegum melodies through a grime-filled trench of hiss and reverb; it hardly seemed like a band at all at this point, but rather an extended flirtation conducted over a lo-fi recording deck. On 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14905-prism-eyes/"" target=""_blank"">Prism Eyes</a>, </i>Reading Rainbow suddenly embraced clarity and rock 'n roll assertiveness, pushing against their limitations as a two-piece to make the loudest, poppiest noise possible. On their new record, <i>Yeah Right</i>, Reading Rainbow has made its biggest change-up yet. For starters, they're now known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30610-httpsoundcloudcomkaninerecords02-pink-ruffs-d7eo9/"" target=""_blank"">Bleeding Rainbow</a>. (Apparently the name change was prompted by a <a href=""http://bleeding-rainbow.tumblr.com/post/13815812354/reading-rainbow-bleeding-rainbow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">disparaging remark</a> from Carrie Brownstein, though that could be embellishment.) More importantly, Bleeding Rainbow has expanded to a quartet, with Everton surrendering the drums to Greg Frantz, and Al Creedon joining Garcia on guitar.</p>
<p>These changes, presumably, were intended to remake Bleeding Rainbow on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/4-yeah-right/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeah Right </i></a>like Dylan Baldi transformed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28679-cloud-nothings/"" target=""_blank"">Cloud Nothings</a> into a hard-hitting post-punk outfit on last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16158-attack-on-memory/"" target=""_blank""><i>Attack on Memory</i></a>, or how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">the Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a> morphed into a widescreen '90s alt-rock group on 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15270-belong/"" target=""_blank"">Belong</a>. </i>Like those groups, <i>Reading</i> Rainbow was frequently described as ""twee"" or ""cutesy""-- an image Everton <a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/discovery-bleeding-rainbow#_"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has expressed reservations about in interviews</a>. Based on <i>Yeah Right</i>, Garcia and Everton would rather Bleeding Rainbow be seen as a dark, dreamy shoegaze-infused pop band. You know, <i>cool. </i>Unfortunately, Garcia and Everton aren't very good at being cool, and were better off when they weren't trying to be.</p>
<p>The most disappointing aspect of <i>Yeah Right </i>is how doubling the band's size hasn't made Bleeding Rainbow sound any fuller or more powerful. Frantz's drumming isn't noticeably better than Everton's rudimentary time-keeping, and aside from the occasional would-be psychedelic interlude, Creedon's leads don't add much to the equation. What this line-up has accomplished is giving Bleeding Rainbow a more professional sound, though the dubious likes of the paint-by-numbers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"" target=""_blank"">MBV</a> homage ""Shades of Eternal Night"" and the corny boy-girl duet ""Inside My Head"" hardly make this seem like a plus. <i>Prism Eyes' </i>fantastic lead-off track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12064-wasting-time/"" target=""_blank"">""Wasting Time""</a> is more anthemic than anything on <i>Yeah Right</i>, and its guileless enthusiasm is sadly missing amid this album's calculated trend-grabs. The handmade quality that made Bleeding Rainbow's first two records so likeable and indelible is absent on <i>Yeah Right</i>; in its place is the serviceable but somewhat generic late 80s/early 90s fuzz pop that's become a default setting for aspirant indie bands.</p>
<p>Strangely, about half of <i>Yeah Right </i>sounds like leftovers from Bleeding Rainbow's former incarnations. These also happen to be the record's best songs. The gutted-out ""Fall Into Your Eyes"" is simultaneously mysterious and innocent, running its hymn-like melody through a buzzsaw of mechanical scrapes and squawks. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14615-waking-dream/"" target=""_blank"">""Waking Dream""</a> is at the opposite end of the sonic spectrum-- its sunny melody and 60s pop bounce conjures the magic of <i>Prism Eyes </i>with a deep, nostalgic pang. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13966-pink-ruff/"" target=""_blank"">""Pink Ruff""</a> is another keeper, zipping along on a snappy rhythm guitar riff that approaches the fresh-faced rock this band once specialized in. <i>Yeah Right </i>has its charms, but they're echoes of a band Bleeding Rainbow used to be under a slightly different name.</p></div>"|17593.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17593-yeah-right/|6.0|Steven Hyden

The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16045-hexagons-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hexagons</i></a> EP released later that year diluted the debut's hints of darkness even further. But the band's new album, <i>Wash the Sins Not Only the Face</i>, manages to transcend the band's cobwebby connotations. Here Esben and the Witch lean towards post-rock, which edges them in the direction of bands that are haunting without being specifically gothic, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28034-warpaint/"" target=""_blank"">Warpaint</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7372-wild-beasts/"" target=""_blank"">Wild Beasts</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Singer Rachel Davies keeps within a narrower vocal range on this record, employing dense layering as a means of intensity. ""I haven't drunk for days/ I'm heady with the haze/ I'm sinking,"" she sings on the hypnotic ""Shimmering"", where rattlesnake tail guitars shake over ride cymbals. The song is emblematic of the sustained tension that ebbs and flows over the course of <i>Wash the Sins; </i>""Slow Wave"" never really reaches a specific precipice, but maintains a nervous edge thanks to its militaristic drum beat and the eerie sounds coming from Thomas Fisher's guitar.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That said, <i>Wash the Sins</i> isn't just a mood exercise. One of the shortest songs on the album, ""Despair"", where clawing guitars build to a vicious climax, is noticeably louder than anything they've done before. ""When That Head Splits"" has some bounce in its rhythm, and opener ""Iceland Spar""'s initial seconds of silence are swiftly exploded by a spiky maelstrom-- a satisfyingly furious streak picked up in the appropriately named album closer, ""Smashed to Pieces in the Still of the Night"", where high-pitched, dissonant guitars riff out to a galloping, near-proggy conclusion. </p>
<p class=""p1"">But the end of the album slumps back toward the kind of drifty ambience found on <i>Violet Cries</i>: ""Putting Down the Prey"" moves lethargically through obtuse lyrics, foregoing any sense of structure to wallow in endless waves of washily textured guitar. On the spacious ""The Fall of Glorieta Mountain"", Davies asks, ""Are you an answer/ Or are you an echo?"" It's a reasonable question for a band that lacks a strong identify. Likewise, <i>Wash the Sins</i> is not a logical, concrete progression from <i>Violet Cries</i> and the <i>Hexagons</i> EP, but a competent if ultimately unmemorable reiteration of a message that wasn't particularly strong in the first place.</p></div>"|17535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17535-wash-the-sins-not-only-the-face/|5.8|Harley Brown

This framework makes it easy to underestimate the kind of ambition Chaz Bundick's demonstrated within the context of Toro Y Moi. He's a prolific artist who never comes off like he's in a race with his muse; he subtly expands his range and refines his production skills, but in genres uniformly bereft of bombast or overstatement. Even after 2011's rep-solidifying <i>Underneath the Pine </i>and its equally worthy successor, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15785-freaking-out-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Freaking Out </i></a>EP<i>, </i>many still want to view him as the guy whose earliest singles became definitive documents of a subgenre synonymous with apathy. So <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/6-anything-in-return/"" target=""_blank""><i>Anything in Return </i></a>can appear like it has Big Third Album things to prove, ambitious in easily understood ways: it's the longest Toro Y Moi album and the loudest as well. It just manages to do those things on Bundick's self-effacing, generous terms. Which shouldn't obscure <i>Anything In Return</i>'s accomplishment of being another strong, forward-thinking record from an artist whose grasp never seems to exceed his reach.</p>
<p><i>Anything in Return </i>serves as a tidy synopsis of everywhere Bundick has taken Toro Y Moi to date. So there's silky R&amp;B, roller-rink pop, bubblegum funk, tasteful chillout music, all unified by a voice that's grown more confident with time. The light touch he applies to his melodies sounds assured rather than meek. The higher BPMs early on make Bundick's peripheral relationship to dance music more overt. He's been on the giving and receiving end of countless remixes and revived his Les Sins project for a partnership with Dan Snaith's Jiaolong label, so he's had plenty of chances to workshop with similarly-minded artists. ""Harm In Change"" is where he shows the results; unlike the introductions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13931-causers-of-this/"" target=""_blank""><i>Causers of This </i></a>or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15129-underneath-the-pine/"" target=""_blank"">Underneath the Pine</a>, Anything In Return </i>doesn't begin on a wobbly note, rousing itself into shape. The bass drum hits almost immediately, and along with single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14706-say-that/"" target=""_blank"">Say That</a>"", ""Harm In Change"" incorporate gestures that would typically have to wait until the inevitable remix make themselves heard: house diva samples serving as punctuation on his own vocal lines, four-on-the-floor beats, modular synth bass, all distinguishing it from the decisively organic <i>Underneath the Pine.</i></p>
<p>That said, it<i> </i>isn't <i>dance</i> <i>music</i> proper, nor does it aim to be. You might already be hearing it as a potential go-to for rooftops, house parties, or any non-club function, or perhaps as dress-up/go-out music for people who don't relate to ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14762-suit-tie/"" target=""_blank"">Suit &amp; Tie</a>"". <i>Anything in Return </i>never feels exclusionary, so the extroversion of the music and the increasingly tony production ensures that any mention of Toro Y Moi as a ""bedroom"" act has to relate to the lyrical concerns only. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14449-so-many-details/"" target=""_blank"">So Many Details</a>"" follows the uptempo introductory duo with a seductive slow grind and cooed lyrics (""This ain't appropriate…I just want to tease your eyes"") that project a polite sort of lasciviousness before unraveling into a hint-dropping, percussive coda. ""Rose Quartz"" consolidates what came before it, two minutes of patient, hands-in-the-air build up before establishing its central juxtaposition of instinctual desires and metaphysical hesitance-- ""Don't let me fall/ 'cause I feel weak.""</p>
<p>As with his previous two LPs, Bundick bookends <i>Anything in Return </i>with the most instantly captivating material, while the middle ultimately establishes the determinative mood. This is where <i>Anything in Return </i>truly differentiates itself. <i>Causers of This </i>took was an immersive experience, aqueous and aquamarine, while the ornate and warm <i>Underneath the Pine<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15129-underneath-the-pine/"" target=""_blank""> </a></i>painted with pastels; <i>Anything In Return </i>is better described by its shape and body rather than its color. While Toro Y Moi is more or less characterized as portable music, you really should consider a nice subwoofer for this one. </p>
<p>This newfound emphasis on the low-end counters his tendency to let songs drift. This is particularly true on tracks that would otherwise be the most stereotypically chillaxed: ""High Living"" anchors itself with bass that lets the good times roll <i>very, very slowly,</i> ""Studies"" lays nasally funk guitar over an insistent drum break, the champagne-swilling ""Touch"" fizzes but never goes flat. It can actually get a little too lost in its luxury; <i>Anything in Return</i> has more truly great music than any Toro Y Moi album, but at 52 minutes, the overall impact gets dulled. When ""Cake"" pops up as the 10th track<i>, </i>it's by far Bundick's most assertively-sung, and the stickiest as well. It's a revelation for him as an artist, but the startling jolt it provides after the midsection makes you feel like the <i>Anything </i>kicked its feet up for about 10 minutes too long.</p>
<p><i>Anything in Return </i>could still be called ""lifestyle music"" in the pejorative sense. If you think Toro Y Moi exists solely as a sonic accessory for buying <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41618-toro-y-mois-new-album-available-as-tote-bag/"" target=""_blank"">tote bags</a>, this album won't do much to change your mind, largely because it doesn't really want to. But Toro Y Moi's music has a relatable quality that can't be overlooked. The most direct lines tend to be fourth-wall busting mentions of being on tour, having no plans on Friday night, and trying to sort out girl problems, especially when they're freaking out about failing a class and how to explain it to their parents.</p>
<p>While tech-obsessed, sonically omnivorous, and emotionally distracted music typically serves as fodder for ""sound of life today"" thinkpieces, <i>Anything in Return </i>embodies a certain ideal of young adulthood at the pace it's actually lived; of fluidity between creative pursuits and careers, between hanging out and making out. It's tough to say whether Bundick is seeking to make a ""statement"" as Toro Y Moi, no more than any of his peers are seeking to define themselves with a nine-to-five (in fact, his definitive song ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11375-blessa/"" target=""_blank"">Blessa</a>"" may have been about the futility of just that). But the occasional structure is helpful for an artist constantly plotting his next move. For now, the musically and emotionally rewarding <i>Anything in Return </i>evokes the feeling of being young with options and in no hurry to figure it all out.</p></div>"|17516.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17516-anything-in-return/|7.9|Ian Cohen

This is an album that causes you to view everything the band did before a little differently, turning 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15409-air-museum/""><i>Air Museum</i></a> into a transitional piece, a necessary step in the build toward <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/5-centralia/"" target=""_blank""><i>Centralia</i></a>. Koen Holtkamp and Brendon Anderegg seem to alter their working methods with each passing release, choosing here to separately layer acoustic and electronic instruments, not manipulating the former with the latter. The technical details aren't too important; to pick apart who did what and where would cause <i>Centralia</i> to lose some of its magic. Instead, it's better to just fall into it, letting it wash over you again and again. The actual <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia,_Pennsylvania"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Centralia</a> is a ghost town in Pennsylvania, a place with a population barely in double figures, condemned by a 1962 mine fire that made it largely uninhabitable. It couldn't be less appropriate as a title-- this <i>Centralia</i> is rich with connection, bustling with possibility. It's got life pulsing through it.</p>
<p>This is an album that finds Mountains expanding outward, replacing bungalows with steeples. Brian Howe noted that the duo ""like a big canvas"" in his review of <i>Air Museum</i>, but nothing from that album feels as all-encompassing as their work here. They've added a touch more movement to their music, with the perma-halt they get locked into mostly intact. But those changes in tone are often startling and moving when they appear. It's there in the unexpected rush of noise halfway through ""Propeller"", and in the lulling cello at the close of ""Sand"". Still, nothing resembles traditional song form, with Holtkamp and Anderegg finding strength in great circular drones, ring-shaped synth accents, and ruminative acoustic picking. Mostly it feels like more thought went into this work than prior Mountains records, with the inclination to spread themselves wide birthed through a rigorous attention to detail. There's a strong sense of objective and design, a feeling of being taken somewhere instead of getting deadlocked in one mood, one place.</p>
<p>That sense of creating shifting conditions is a key differentiator between this and any similar works. <i>Centralia</i> is primarily concerned with beauty and contact, creating hypnotic melodies that resonate with meaning as their looped paths uncoil. It's music to get lost in on a certain level, but you can feel pliable human emotions tugging hard on your shoulder throughout. Partly that's due to Mountains improving at integrating their earthy and otherworldly impulses. The acoustic plucking and blocky drones of ""Circular C"" don't feel like they're drawn from separate strains of thought, pushing folk traditions and analog synthesis together as if they were always meant to co-exist. Mountains' guitar work has often resembled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8168-ben-chasny/"">Ben Chasny</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3807-six-organs-of-admittance/"">Six Organs of Admittance</a> output, and that remains a constant here, especially in ""Tilt"", a track that gathers poignancy as it gains momentum. Here, they're as skilled at change as they are at staying lost in time.</p>
<p>It's to <i>Centralia</i>'s great credit that its 20-minute centerpiece, ""Propeller"", doesn't completely dwarf everything that comes before and after. ""Propeller"" is huge and masterful, the fullest embodiment of the ""pure phase"" aesthetic Jason Pierce was working toward on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a> album of the same name. The fact that it's a live recording, albeit one sweetened by a few studio tweaks, is particularly impressive considering the immaculate way all the parts twist around one another. It's here that the possibilities for this music seem boundless. This is music for wide open spaces, full of reach and depth. It's not exactly Mountains' gambit for the big time, but it is the kind of track that could open them up to a wider audience, principally because it takes what they do so well-- repetitive motions executed with ample emotional impact-- and blows it wide open. There are even a few power chords thrown into the following ""Liana"", further emphasizing the maximal strength Mountains have harvested for this release.</p>
<p>Holtkamp and Anderegg's bursts of robustness on <i>Centralia</i> don't quite tell the full story. It's matched by a tenderness that occasionally mirrors the kind of blues Dave Pajo was feeling circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3247-papa-m/"">Papa M</a>'s <i>Live from a Shark Cage</i>, and a hush that Jason Noble was reaching for in the post-classical outfit, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3506-rachels/"">Rachel's</a>. There's a continuity between this and prior Mountains releases, but it's more grandiose than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12698-choral/""><i>Choral</i></a>, more focussed than <i>Air Museum</i>. In its longer stretches it's similar to the no-waste ethic of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16964-the-seer/""><i>The Seer</i></a>, where every tiny detail serves the bigger picture, where nothing in an ostensibly open-ended piece is allowed to drift unattached. <i>Centralia</i> is less severe than <i>The Seer</i>, but it's executed with the same unyielding desire to move and to feel. It's impressive how multi-purpose some of the tracks can be. You can zone out to the one-note drone that ""Sand"" arcs into for a while, only to be yanked somewhere else altogether when a great slide of strings pulls you down. That's the spot Mountains inhabit, in a capacious synchronization of the real and the unreal, a space they've gloriously matured into.</p></div>"|17560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17560-centralia/|8.1|Nick Neyland

It was a bit of a shock, then, when in 2010 the Antlers' Peter Silberman remixed short samples from their entire sophomore album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14574-the-orchard/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Orchard</i></a>, into a four-minute glitchy electronic track that by his admission sounded ""pretty foreign from the source."" He was actually remarkably prescient: for their third record, <i>Beta Love</i>, the quintet enlisted producer Dennis Herring (Modest Mouse, Elvis Costello) to help them move away from the bittersweet violin and cello they felt had come to pigeonhole them since their first release in 2006. Along with a lyrical focus inspired by Ray Kurzweil's <i>The Singularity Is Near</i>, which the band had been reading before they made the album, Ra Ra Riot incorporated more keyboards and synthesizers into many of the songs on <i>Beta Love</i>. This new technology-informed attitude represents a necessary change for a band known mostly for one thing. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The group might have felt hemmed in by a formula, but it was one that worked for them. For instance  the deep cello moans that opened <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12099-the-rhumb-line/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Rhumb Line</i></a>'s<i> </i>""Ghost Under Rocks"" are still viscerally affecting years and countless indie chamber-pop imitators later. The keyboards stabbing at <i>Beta Love </i>opener ""Dance With Me"" set the tone for the album's overall harder, faster tempos, which peaks during the machine-gun drums on ""Binary Mind"", one of the songs that speaks most directly to Ra Ra Riot's concern with Kurzweil's transhumanism: ""Why, tell me why/ I want to read you with this binary mind/ 'Cause if I do/ I'm sure that we'll be complete."" Later, ""Angel, Please"" picks up where that track's hi-NRG left off, bringing out singer Wesley Miles' similarity to Phil Collins in pitch, intonation, and the use of ""angel"" as romantic epithet (the tambourines and handclaps don't hurt, either). To his credit, Miles definitely pushes his vocal range higher on <i>Beta Love</i>, even if he strains it to Jemaine Clement levels of absurdity on the R&amp;B-leaning slow jam ""Wilderness"". And Miles takes sexy too far on ""What I Do For U"", sinking his delicate vibrato behind bass hits so incongruously deep they sound poorly mixed.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Ra Ra Riot are best when they stick with what they wanted to get away from. ""Is It Too Much"" pulses with a metronome tick, a slight piano melody nestling between violinist Rebecca Zeller's judicious peals. The track would slot perfectly next to Discovery, Miles' electronic side project with Vampire Weekend's Rostam Batmanglij. ""When I Dream"", the album's haunting high point, provides a template for how <i>Beta Love</i> could have worked. Instead of overcrowding with layers of instrumentation, Ra Ra Riot play off a similarly minimal heartbeat pulse, filling the spaces between with single piano chords as opposed to a continually bursting synthesizers. When they do build to the subtle climaxes, Zeller's violin swells and the finger snaps click into place at precisely the right time. But the moment is lost on the rabid drum fills on follower ""That Much"", which returns to the bombast that relentlessly drives the rest of the album. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It's unclear where Ra Ra Riot will go from here. After some bad tours and the departure of cellist Alexandra Lawn, the brasher tracks on <i>Beta Love </i>come across  as cathartic, as though the band is doing a silly dance or yelling obscenities as a necessary release from a stagnant situation. If that is the case, then the album's understated moments are a reassuring reminder that Ra Ra Riot still have some of <i>The Rhumb Line</i> in them. </p></div>"|17513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17513-beta-love/|5.2|Harley Brown

""Time and Place"" is an offer of comfort and warm nostalgia, almost impossible to be read multiple ways. Yet the manner in which it's actually sung raises a question that goes to the core of songwriting: who exactly is ""I"" here? Hartley's obviously the guy standing in front of a microphone, but he's harmonized at least four layers deep, airbrushing any sort of human impurity that defines ""personal"" expression. And besides, how is this technologically defiled sound indicative of someone's teen years? It's a big-concept, low-budget rendering of the space age sound redolent of any of the movies that came out as an immediate result of <i>Star Wars</i>. If Hartley is indeed 52 years old, he's a young-looking 52. However, let it rush past you like a gust of brisk mountain air once the drums come in, and it's quite lovely.</p>
<p>So it goes on <i>Oak Island, </i>35 minutes of romantic and robotic soft rock, a crush mixtape for the Uncanny Valley. It doesn't have specific forebears, though recent trends in indie rock at least give it precedent; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28643-gayngs/"" target=""_blank"">Gayngs</a>' perverted take on 10cc, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a>'s autotuned Hornsby homage ""Beth/Rest,"" and specifically <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"" target=""_blank"">Destroyer</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kaputt </i></a>in the use of the delayed trumpets that waft through Hartley's ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14426-so-far-so-long/"" target=""_blank"">So Far So Long</a>"". All of these are examples of stylistic music that uses the studio as a means of reducing human error, or at least achieving some higher level of musicianship while letting the listener know just how much it cost to attempt such feats. Hartley takes it further on <i>Oak Island </i>by just about erasing the idea of it ever being performed by three or four men in a room. It's intentionally android, but not the kind of dystopian man-machine mind-meld explored by, say, <i>Kid A </i>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4590-silent-shout/"" target=""_blank""><i>Silent Shout</i></a>.</p>
<p>These are mostly love songs, though the juxtapositions of the synthetic, multilayered sonics with the simply worded lyrics of ""You're My Baby"" or ""Born To Love"" turn the record as a whole into a kind of long-form pun about phrases like ""motherboard"" or ""you were made for me""; playing with the idea of our potential to be figuratively programmed into certain roles or romantic desires. As such, while I know full and well that Nightlands is the project of Dave Hartley, bassist of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"" target=""_blank"">War on Drugs</a> and occasional NBA writer, it's much easier to imagine it as the narrator of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>'s ""Something About Us"" coping with a broken heart.</p>
<p>The album cover can be taken as a pretty good allowance that the listener has free rein to get as fantastical as they want when imagining the physical space occupied by <i>Oak Island.</i> Maybe this will sound great in summer, but I can tell you it's a fantastic accompaniment for winter: so much of the digitally processed and pitch-shifted guitar shimmers like tinsel, the percussion jingles, nylon strings, and dulcimers contribute to a mix that's thick and boozy as eggnog. Even the melodies hint at Yuletide: ""So Far So Long"" and ""Other Peoples Pockets"" have cyclical, massed choruses that sound a lot like caroling.</p>
<p>It could've all turned out to be an insufferable gimmick had Hartley not managed to cover a lot of ground by making odd turns into peripheral genres; ""Born To Love"" is a slow dance on the lido deck, ""I Fell in Love With a Feeling"" boasts a revved-up beat and emotional yearning that puts it within the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"" target=""_blank"">Springsteen</a>-to-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28599-twin-shadow/"" target=""_blank"">Twin Shadow</a> lineage of pouty motorcycle heroics, while the stacked ELO harmonies and nerdy horns cut against the machismo. It gets even more bizarre towards the end: ""Rolling Down The Hill"" works itself into an Afro-funk frenzy while the stately ""Other Peoples Pockets"" is nearly hymnal. It's played straight and, as such, is paradoxically weirder than what came before.</p>
<p>There are no clues as to why it's called <i>Oak Island</i> and I don't necessarily think Googling it would enrich the experience.

Even the most precise noise or drone contains moments in which the creator reacts to the creation rather than controlling it. That factor of randomness makes it tough to improve and refine a particular approach, but in the past few years, that's exactly what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30481-mike-shiflet/"" target=""_blank"">Mike Shiflet</a> has done. From 2010's <i><a href=""http://mikeshiflet.bandcamp.com/album/llanos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Llanos </a></i>to 2011's <i><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/_type/sets/mike-shiflet-sufferers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sufferers</a></i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16786-merciless/""><i>Merciless</i>,</a> Shiflet has found new possibilities in his sound by diving deeper into it. In my review of <i>Merciless</i>, I almost called that album his peak, and I'm glad I held out: <i>The Choir, the Army</i> is undoubtedly his best release to date.</p>
<p>Exactly why it's the best is hard to summarize, since there's so much happening in the album's nine rich, ever unfolding tracks. But one standout reason is the way Shiflet's array of tones and techniques-- ambiance, dissonance, melody, repetition-- feel like integral parts of a natural whole. This isn't simply a matter of track sequencing or transitions. It's also the overwhelming sense that every song is guided by a single hand, and every sound plays an equal role. So a blast of static in one piece can feel uncannily similar to a distant bass in another. The resulting cohesion makes<i> The Choir, the Army</i> a kind of wordless story, with each track more like a chapter in a book or a scene in a movie than a song in a collection.</p>
<p>This narrative line is clear from the start. Just compare the first two tracks, the sparse, rattling ""1917"" and the dense, grand ""Zahlentheorie"". On the surface, in the sounds they use and the spaces they fill, the tracks are practically opposites. But the way Shiflet builds them, widening their sonic scope as if he's panning and zooming a camera, they end up feeling like twins. This connective tissue gives him the freedom to trace a wide, diverse path, from the construction-site rattle of ""Attrition"" to the glitchy atmospherics of ""False Flats"" to the trebly whirr of ""Omicron Serenade"", and without ever losing his sense of direction.</p>
<p>It also gives <i>The Choir, the Army</i> an emotional resonance that's not easy to coax from music this abstract. It's there in the shifting grooves of ""Asymptotes"", which morphs random clanging into a kind of evocative noise choir. The warped waves of ""Passenchendale"" are poignantly blurry, echoing the hazy distortion of memory. And there's a hint of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3935-stars-of-the-lid/"">Stars of the Lid</a>'s stoic longing in the slow-but-tense drift of ""Inching"". Throughout, Shiflet lets his sounds build and arc, never forcing them into shapes or interrupting their flow to grab your attention. In other words, they often feel more like life than art.</p>
<p>Yet the song that I find myself coming back to most is the one with the most obvious artifice. Closer ""Yonder"" offers the most layers of any track, and for the first time you can see the skeleton beneath Shiflet's sonic skin. It's made of tape hiss, rolling static, violin-like creak, and an achingly off-key guitar that adds both creepy aura and nostalgic sadness. But Shiflet's consistent vision gives ""Yonder""'s transparency as much impact as anything on <i>The Choir, the Army</i>. In a way, it represents the album perfectly: varied sounds that achieve a unified goal, and make you itch to hear them again.</p></div>"|17638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17638-the-choir-the-army/|7.8|Marc Masters

In a year when bass music was getting further acquainted with the charts on both sides of the Atlantic, <i>SBTRKT </i>found a way to streamline producer Aaron Jerome's clean, rhythmically intricate yet suitably catchy style into a sound that felt distinctly aboveground. And while guest spots from singers like Jessie Ware and Little Dragon's Yukimi Nagano took SBTRKT's compatibility with R&amp;B and indie pop to its logical conclusion, it was the yearning, gentle murmuring of regular collaborator Sampha that proved to be the most characteristic and distinct voice on the record.</p>
<p>In the following year, SBTRKT took his show on the road, and a real sense of showmanship-- elaborate masks, quick shifts from programmed to live percussion, Sampha's presence as a singer and multi-instrumentalist-- made those concerts a sensory-overload experience. That energy's visually borne out in the two videos that come with the LP/DVD version of <i>Live</i>, an album culled from a pair of shows recorded at London venue Shepherds Bush Empire last October. But unfortunately those video excerpts are the closest this set comes to doing justice to what seems like it could've been an exciting series of shows. Because if there's one thing that threatens to ruin the atmosphere of a really tight performance like this, it's a foggy recording, mixing, or mastering job that fails to capture the dynamic pop of SBTRKT's drums, whether programmed or behind the kit.</p>
<p>It's not quite bootleg cameraphone-recording quality, but from the outset of ""Surely"" it's clear something's up-- what should be crisp, resonant snares sound like cardboard, kicks feel mushy, and hi-hats have the weak timbre of rattling chain link fences. It's a shame, because this version takes what was a fairly forgettable bonus 7"" from the LP version of <i>SBTRKT </i>and ups its tempo, using it as a good base to rhythmically improvise some glitchy freeform beats and turning an afterthought into an anthem. Sampha's voice suffers, too-- its strength is in his subtlety, and while he sounds powerful over minimal accompaniment, a lot of nuance is lost when he sings over heavy instrumentation. What should be the most emotional moments on ""Never Never"" and ""Trials of the Past"" give the unfair illusion that he's short of breath and trying to catch up.</p>
<p>Everything else about <i>Live </i>seems almost secondary to the cruddy sound quality, but it'd be a shame to detract from what SBTRKT was going for here. The addition of London's Heritage Orchestra on tracks like ""Trials of the Past"" and ""Go Bang"" isn't your typical class-up-the-joint schmaltz move; the strings really do wring out some additional emotional highs. The version of ""Wildfire"" is deliriously inspired, as SBTRKT takes Nagano's voice and chops it up into a stammering percussive riff, extending one of his signature singles into a high-energy sprawl. And one previously unheard track, the surprisingly techno-indebted ""Migration"" (a segue out of <i>SBTRKT </i>highlight ""Hold On""), definitely gives followup-hungry fans something more to look forward to for the next release. This concert album's heart is in the right place. It's too bad that the mics weren't.</p></div>"|17585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17585-live/|5.5|Nate Patrin

Aside from being yet another notch in his famous prolific streak, it's a natural step for Segall to start the year with a new project. As he <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/ty-segall-twins-interview-new-garage-renaissance?page=4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained to <i>Spin</i></a>, he thrives in the studio. ""I've been on tour for three years straight, basically. It's not my favorite thing; recording is. It's so fun,"" he said, adding, ""You can get weird.""

<p>Around 2006, Segall and Cronin started the Laguna Beach garage punk band <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Epsilons"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Epsilons</a>, and since then, they've worked together several times.

<p>The album's first six tracks are garage songs washed in acid-soaked sonics, and they're ultimately unremarkable when stacked next to the rest of either man's discography. Throughout the album, Segall and Cronin tap into John Dwyer-ian psychedelics, and with pitched-down throaty vocals, the effects feel like a gimmick and cheapens the material. Their more straightforward readings of ""I Wear Black"", for example, are immediately more interesting than the markedly slower studio version. (Evidence: the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuERZQ3_7SQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daytrotter version</a>.) But when they stick the landing on their more psychedelic tendencies, the results are extremely satisfying. Easily, the best tracks on the album are the final two: Their muddy-but-faithful cover of Pink Floyd's <i>Piper at the Gates of Dawn </i>cut ""Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk"" and their 10-minute opus ""Reverse Shark Attack"". The title track switches gears several times, incorporating bubbly psych pop, soft acoustic guitars, a Dick Dale fast-surf outro, and the same sort of slow-burning melodrama you could hear in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16345-sorrow-and-extinction/"">the Pallbearer album</a>. For a song that jumps around to a few different melodic devices, they're strung together beautifully.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Reverse Shark Attack </i>is a fine example of the downsides to getting weird in the studio. Sometimes, you strike gold. Sometimes, veering into psychedelic territory makes your songs sound unnecessarily cheap. It stands in contrast to Ty's work with the Traditional Fools, who shy away from additional effects and stick to drunken, lo-fi budget rock. In 2008, the trio-- Segall, David Fox, and Andrew Luttrell-- bashed out a series of trashy surf punk songs, four of which are just over one minute long. (That proved to be a troglodyte year for Segall-- he also released his raucous one-man-band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13262-ty-segall-lemons/"">debut solo album</a> on Castle Face.) And really, if the sunglasses-clad cheeseburgers on the cover don't already give you a sense of the album's overall vibe, the track titles should: ""Snot Rag"", ""Shredstick"", ""Get Off My Back"", ""Party at My House"".</p>
<p>But here's the thing-- while it's not an ambitious album, every song is solid. Their intention was to create a rock'n'roll party album (from ""Party at My House"": ""Parents comin' home,/ Won't you get the fuck out?""), and with that mission in their sights, they recorded 12 earworm-laden tracks that wouldn't sound out of place at a deranged Frankie and Annette <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_party_film"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">beach party</a>.

It took a while, though; dropped by Interscope, he was eventually swept into Rick Ross' nascent Maybach Music imprint, a group built to include both intriguing firebrands (Philly's Meek Mill, <a href=""http://youtu.be/uJIv0i3bkxg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fishing enthusiast</a> Gunplay) as well as rappers seeking either a consistent identity (Ohio's Stalley, Atlanta's now-invisible Pill) or a fresh start. Wale fell into the latter category, immediately switching his whole style up, transitioning from a rapper who bathed his aesthetic in his hometown's trademark go-go music, wore colorful hats, and dangled Seinfeld ephemera in his recordings to just another above-average rapper miring in bald bitterness, club rap, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15472-mmg-presents-self-made-vol-1/"">feckless crew collaborations</a>. In 2011, Wale put out the well-enough-received <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16002-wale-ambition/"">Ambition</a></i>-- a well-balanced digest of his new, more jaded grip on the game-- a record that happened to contain the #1 Billboard Hip-Hop Single ""Lotus Flower Bomb"", probably the highest charting single from last year that no one will admit to liking. In a world where first-disc flameouts often go the way of the Recycle Bin, it could have been worse.</p>
<p>So, in a sense it's exciting to herald Wale's new mixtape, <i>Folarin</i> (his surname), as his best release since the initial hype-generator <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11963-the-mixtape-about-nothing/"">The Mixtape About Nothing</a></i>. That doesn't necessarily mean Wale has completely exorcised his inclination to be a humongous cornball-- the Tiara Thomas-featuring ""Bad"" features some more of that cringe-worthy ""Diced Pineapples""-style poetry-- but <i>Folarin</i>, in its way, approximates something close to being Wale's version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16172-rich-forever/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rich Forever</i></a>. Like that release, <i>Folarin</i> is long and comes complete with a couple throwaways like ""H20"" (an ode to ""thirst"" and a song built around a sample of bed squeaking), but it also serves as a platform for some of Wale's most carefree, fun songs. After hearing cuts like the Beat Billionare-produced 2 Chainz collab ""Get Me Doe"" and Chinx Drugz-featuring ""Let a Nigga Know"", you wonder why Wale doesn't just sit back and lob one-liners at visiting guests more often. The list of collaborators on <i>Folarin</i> is a characteristically mixed-bag featuring only one other labelmate-- Diplo, Trinidad James, French Montana, Hit-Boy (as a rapper), Danny! (as a producer)-- none of it feels like desperate crowdsourcing. Trinidad, in particular, delights in his bellicose blip, and the Diplo/Travis Porter rave-up ""The One Eye Kitten Song"" underlines <i>Folarin</i>'s mission of pushing Wale into more lighthearted territory.</p>
<p><i>Attention Deficit</i> was such an overreach that most folks wrote Wale off; not even a realignment with one of modern rap's biggest stars could fully invigorate the reputation of the one-time Next Big Thing. And, I'm not arguing that <i>Folarin</i> does that-- Wale is still in his own way with syrupy drivel like ""Money Changes""-- but it does find the DC rapper having a better time, generally speaking. He's still the Wale you love or revile, a rapper who almost always lyrically overcooks it (""We out Garfield, we goin' Odie / With rap performance of Forbes got me catchin' up Oprah""), but it sounds like he's letting himself off the hook a little bit for his major label false start.</p></div>"|17586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17586-folarin/|6.9|Corban Goble

But Klein, an ex-member of New Jersey rockers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus/"" target=""_blank"">Titus Andronicus</a>, tilts her hand just enough to imply that it could also be nation, rather than just a person, that’s left her feeling equal parts enraged and empathetic.</p>
<p>Amid the scuffed-up beauty of dime-store guitars rubbing up against Catherine Tung's brutalized drum kit, Klein seethes about deception in ""American Rail"" with a personal sense of betrayal: ""In my dreams/ I believe all the lies you told me,"" she sings, in a voice that sounds both confessional and accusatory. On the dreamy travelogue ""Louisville"", she echoes the pleas of a forgotten underclass: ""Don't bring me down/ Higher than the water/ Don’t bring me down/ I don't want to lose my ground."" This neglect explodes into physical abuse on ""Double Dutch"", where Klein spits, ""I can see all the marks that your arms left on me/ I can see what you are.""</p>
<p>Or, you know, Klein could be singing about some asshole she's happy to have rid herself of. Even when she tiptoes precariously close to making A Statement-- like on the album-opening ""Way Back When"", a lilting folk-rock number that alludes to a returning soldier's difficult homecoming-- she always keeps one foot tucked safely in ambiguity. Hilly Eye songs are built on simple, opaque lines that are transformed into stinging slogans; on ""Animal"", the money line is ""All the boys who get beaten up/ all the girls who get beaten down,"" which Klein delivers as a manic yelp and a churlish taunt over guitars that similarly oscillate alternating shades of pretty and ugly.</p>
<p>Lyrically, <i>Reasons to Live</i> is pitched somewhere between an angry breakup record and an ethereal, post-psychedelic protest screed. Musically, it seems to have been purposely constructed to deny easy satisfaction-- or satisfaction of any kind, really. If the meaning of these songs is difficult to pin down, so is their emotional core. Hilly Eye's primary musical characteristic-- the soft-loud dynamics of Klein and Tung's untrained harmonies and their pummeling, near-amateurish instrumental attack-- is the oldest trick in the indie-rock handbook. The lack of technique gives <i>Reasons to Live </i>an unfinished quality that suggests there's either more depth than there appears to be, or an underlying emptiness deriving from too much feral energy and not enough songwriting. </p>
<p>Given Klein's track record, I'm inclined to believe the former. Hilly Eye's emaciated sound is about as far as you can get from the all-fists-on-deck expansiveness of Titus Andronicus. It seems like a shortcut to something more singular to Klein's own experiences. What's left unresolved on <i>Reasons to Live </i>is what, exactly, Klein has to say about those experiences. It's a record borne of confusion-- though, to its credit, it's <i>about </i>confusion as well. ""I am too young/ I am too old,"" she sings on ""Almanac"", which meanders aimlessly for a few minutes before magically producing the album's most rousing riff. Klein might still be figuring herself out, but the identity she seeks is definitely worth finding.</p></div>"|17536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17536-reasons-to-live/|6.1|Steven Hyden

Fuelled by restless curiosity and a scholar's attention to detail, Roberts has long split his attentions between interpretations of traditional material and his own original songs, while often leaving blurry the distinction between the two. On <i>A Wonder Working Stone</i>, his first collection of all original material since 2009's <i>Spoils</i>, the line separating the traditional from the personal is purposefully left fuzzier than ever. Stray bits and pieces from old fiddle tunes and Scottish bagpipe marches are woven tightly with Roberts' thorny lyrics to create elaborate, raucous medleys that can seem almost like a tin-can-and-string phone connection between the past and the present.</p>
<p><i>A Wonder Working Stone</i> comes on the heels of two albums of traditional material, 2010's <i>Too Long in This Condition</i> and 2012's <i>Urstan</i>, a collection of old Gaelic pieces recorded with Mairi Morrison. By all evidence, the time spent researching and recording those albums stoked Roberts' creative fires as a lyricist. His songs here abound with passing images (""We'll be drinking like masons/ mixing the gunpowder into the wine"") that sound as though they could've been discovered in some half-remembered book of folklore.</p>
<p>Roberts' voice sounds in fine fettle as well, and his reedy, keening brogue is the type of immediately distinctive instrument that is virtually impossible to imagine any listener accidentally mistaking for someone else's. Nevertheless, the ""and Friends"" included on the album cover is there for a reason; this is resolutely a <i>band</i> album. Roberts is joined here by an international host of like-minded talents, with the additions of electric guitarist Ben Reynolds and fiddle player Rafe Fitzpatrick particularly crucial to an overall sound that recalls the early 70s folk-rock fusions of Fairport Convention or Steeleye Span. The album also features the occasional contributions of a horn section and strings from members of the Scottish early music ensemble Concerto Caledonia, but the arrangements are kept loose and casual, sounding at points as though these musicians had just happened upon each other down at their local.</p>
<p>""Tiny wren under the linden/ pondering in wonder the human conundrum,"" Roberts sings on ""Wheels of the World/The Human Conundrum"", the album's rambling 9-minute centerpiece. Borrowing strands from Scottish and Irish sources, this piece perhaps best exemplifies Roberts' musical and thematic approach for the album. Nearly every song here is marked by abrupt time changes and eccentric structural shifts that can make them seem almost episodic in nature, with elegiac fiddle solos or raucous sing-a-along choruses bursting in at unexpected angles. These musical mood swings do amply reflect Roberts' tumultuous lyrics, which frequently describe a landscape of lonely boneyards and lurking misery, peopled by such characters as ""the queen of the unseen"" and ""friar of denial.""</p>
<p>Despite these shadows, however, the overall mood is one of celebrating in the face of encroaching doom. (It's telling that the first song here is entitled ""The Merry Wake"".) The album's most rollicking track, ""Scandal and Trance"", might also be its strangest. Cribbing a melody from the traditional ""We Shall Walk Through the Streets of the City"", better known to singing cowboy fans as ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC1Pu7bscbw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Red River Valley</a>"", Roberts and group turn the track into a woozy and somewhat befuddling hoedown. Yet at song's end, when Roberts and group sing ""Get over your tiny self/ all days will end in joy/ they'll never end in evil"" it serves as a reminder of the communal and participatory nature of the folk traditions that Roberts so celebrates, and it is not difficult to feel like joining in.</p></div>"|17554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17554-a-wonder-working-stone/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

During the long, expensive sessions that produced 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5769-waiting-for-the-sirens-call/"" target=""_blank""><i>Waiting for the Sirens' Call</i></a>, New Order recorded a small pile of extra material, the idea being that they'd get a few more songs down after the subsequent tour and call it another album. But they stopped playing together after 2006, then bassist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6412-peter-hook/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Hook</a> left the band acrimoniously, and the two camps spent a few years bickering at one another. However, since the return of keyboardist Gillian Gilbert, they've been touring again as, effectively, an oldies act-- minus Hook. (Their set lists last year featured, typically, all of two post-1993 songs, and encores from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a> catalogue.)</p>
<p>Now, following extended tussles over mixes and copyright, they're finally releasing the leftovers from their final sessions with Hook: six previously unheard songs, plus one remixed <i>Sirens' Call</i> track and the awesome ""Hellbent"", which appeared on the 2011 Joy Division/New Order singles cash-in, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42572-joy-division-and-new-order-get-joint-best-of/"" target=""_blank""><i>Total</i></a>. Eight songs in a bit under 40 minutes; that's an EP by 2013 standards, but it's longer than either <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12418-movement-power-corruption-and-lies-low-life-brotherhood-technique-deluxe-editions/"" target=""_blank""><i>Movement</i> or <i>Brotherhood</i></a>.</p>
<p>Singer/guitarist Bernard Sumner has <a href=""http://www.emusic.com/listen/#/music-news/interview/interview-new-order/:"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">called</a> <i>Lost Sirens</i> ""a non-completed album, [the likes of] which we've never released before."" That's not necessarily evident from listening to it, and they've certainly released a lot of more ragged material in the past. These are densely packed, finely detailed arrangements in New Order's late-80s rock-with-keyboards mode-- much more recognizable as the work of the band that recorded ""Dream Attack"" than the one that recorded ""Fine Time"". Sumner's lyrics are, as usual, almost half-baked a tad more often than they're almost profound, and his voice still sounds exactly as clear, earnest, and likeably strained as it did when he was a babyfaced ex-punk with a ridiculous haircut.</p>
<p>A lot of what made 80s-era New Order special, though, was their perpetual fascination with body music and the culture around it-- the way they always latched onto the dance music of the moment, from the tail-end of disco to Latin freestyle to acid house, and reworked it in their own idiom. <i>Lost Sirens</i> obviously can't suggest much familiarity with what's going on in dance clubs in 2013, and it doesn't suggest what was going on there when it was recorded close to a decade ago; the clock stopped for their groove sense around the time they first broke up. (""Hellbent"" would sound totally natural mixed out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3394-primal-scream/"" target=""_blank"">Primal Scream</a>'s Madchester anthem ""Loaded."")</p>
<p>Peter Hook's presence on <i>Lost Sirens</i> is, understandably, somewhat muted-- there are a few of his signature fretless bass solos scattered around the album, but this is very much a guitar-driven, Sumner-centered record. Aside from occasional New Order-y instrumental flourishes, it wouldn't be a surprise to learn that these were actually recordings by Sumner's 90s band, Electronic. Even so, every time Hook's bass rears up in the mix-- the lead to the chorus of ""Californian Grass"", or the instrumental break in ""I've Got a Feeling""-- it's a reminder of how well Sumner, Hook, and Stephen Morris always played together, and how their collaboration had an instrumental identity as distinctive as any band's. It's worth noting that the titles of both of those songs echo the Beatles' postponed, bickered-over swan song, <i>Let It Be</i>.</p>
<p>""It's been 10 long years since I've been home,"" begins ""I Told You So"", the one song here reprised from <i>Sirens' Call. </i>(The very different mix here sounds more like a rewrite of ""All Tomorrow's Parties"".) That's a doubly barbed line in this context, made more so by how Sumner follows it a moment later: ""It's an occupation I don't like/ But it pays the rent and turns on the light."" Maybe New Order have some more albums in them; maybe with Gilbert back in the fold they'll recast themselves as a singles act again. Maybe not. These remnants of their most recent burst of creative fecundity are a decent way for them to go out, if they are indeed going to be playing the hits to pay the rent from here on out. As an album, <i>Lost Sirens</i> isn't at all an embarrassment: it's a document of a band whose range and reach, rather than power, are what has been diminished.</p></div>"|17532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17532-lost-sirens/|6.8|Douglas Wolk

It's important to point out, because it sometimes seems like the world has forgotten as much. CVB has managed the dubious trick of being <i>influential</i> without being <i>imitated</i>-- they helped to invent the since outmoded term ""college rock,"" paving the way for much of the music covered by this very website. They're a part of history, but haven't transcended it. Any credible document of American underground rock music must list Camper Van Beethoven in the index, but good luck finding a contemporary band that will namedrop them in interviews.</p>
<p>Since reuniting in 1999 after a nine-year hiatus, Camper Van Beethoven has carved out a decent niche playing live shows for diehards, often touring in tandem with Cracker, whose membership has included Lowery's cohorts in CVB off and on again over the years. The demand for new CVB material outside of that small cult isn't exactly raging, particularly after 2004's decently received <i>New Roman Times. </i>Camper Van Beethoven has not been sought out by a new audience, aside from a curious student or two at the University of Georgia inspired to check out their instructor's discography. And the negative view on <i>La Costa</i> <i>Perdida</i>, the band's first release in eight years,<i> </i>is that it's not a terribly necessary record.</p>
<p>It isn't an ideal starting point for neophytes, anyway. <i>Perdida</i> is more approachable than <i>New Roman Times--</i> which was a heady concept record about post-9/11 America, far-right militias, Fundamentalist Christian sects, and other assorted detritus floating in the yoke of political extremism-- tying together CVB's zany, chopped-genre sundaes with a thread of sunbaked Northern Californian pleasantries. Hearing these guys play together, presumably huddled in tight and facing a window with a killer view of the ocean, is pretty delightful for much of <i>La Costa Perdida. </i>But the songs themselves aren't all that memorable. The gorgeous country rock of the album-opening ""Come Down The Coast"" comes closest to sticking, even if it veers furthest from the CVB template and toward a full-on homage to <i>Kerosene Hat­-</i>era Cracker. Please, if you have any desire to learn about this group, head straight to 1989's <i>Key Lime Pie </i>and only revisit <i>La Costa Perdida </i>once you've exhausted the rest of the catalog.</p>
<p>If you happen to already love this band, <i>La Costa Perdida </i>warrants a more positive assessment. Maybe contemporary indie-rock isn't flooded with CVB sound-alikes because this happens to be a very difficult band to rip off. Jonathan Segel's vertigo-inducing violin swirls on the fractured English folk of ""Someday Our Love Will Sell Us Out"" could only exist on a CVB record; ditto that for ""Peaches in the Summertime"", a ska-punk-bluegrass ditty that processes its grossly disparate sounds with a straight face and casual flick of the wrist. ""Too High for the Love-In"" shoots Lowery's snarky lyrics through an airy sunshine pop melody that turns sinister during an unexpected acid-rock coda, when Lowery infuses the ""make me a sandwich"" mantra with bizarre malevolence.</p>
<p>Even if <i>La Costa Perdida </i>isn't a great Camper Van Beethoven record, it does illustrate how unique this band still is, 30 years after it formed. And it truly is a kick to hear CVB ply its craft with road-tested assurance and subtly virtuosic musicianship. The bluesy vamp ""You Got to Roll"" doesn't totally work on record, but it should sound great in a concert setting, where the proggy accents of ""Summer Days"" and the ""Euro-Trash Girl""-like epic ""Northern California Girls"" will also likely catch fire. In lieu of having great material, at least Camper Van Beethoven can count on being itself better than anybody else.</p></div>"|17548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17548-la-costa-perdida/|6.3|Steven Hyden

""<i>Almanac</i> is like moving into a big old house in the woods with sheets covering all the furniture, and then taking all the sheets off."" The languidly-voiced singer may have been referring to the group's actual experience recording in an old barn in the Hudson River Valley, but the description works on a more intrinsic level as well. The crackling of a fire that begins opener ""Perennials"" burns off the home-recording dust that has been trailing them since their debut <i>October Tape </i>EP, clarifying the song's ringing guitar line and sharpening the indefinable edges of Hamilton's croon. You can practically hear the snap of the sheets as Widowspeak unveil their new sound, expanding upon the hazy, ""Gun Shy""-slinging pop Americana that encouraged them to move from the Pacific Northwest to New York in the first place. </p>
<p>With <i>Widowspeak</i>, Hamilton and guitarist Robert Earl Thomas settled into uncovered ground between Ennio Morricone, Cowboy Junkies, and Neil Young. The interplay between Hamilton's lilting melodies and Thomas' stiff-legged, articulate riffs gave definition to what in lesser hands would just be sepia-toned retrospectives. Songs like the skeletal ""Limbs"", with haunting background vocals crawling through the wreckage of a violin, were refreshingly familiar but also shocking; like a lost photograph of a childhood memory from a different angle. More than their contemporaries and immediate predecessors trafficking in similar themes, Widowspeak were filtering everything through a more self-aware light, perfecting Amanda Petrusich's idea that Instagram makes you to feel <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/petrusich/instagram-the-nostalgia-of-now-and-reckoning-the"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""nostalgic for a time you never actually knew.""</a> (Even <i>Almanac</i>'s album cover is a self-proclaimed homage to Wings, <i>Sound of Silence</i>, and the Carpenters LPs, with Hamilton coyly looking up at Thomas in a vintage dress undoubtedly gleaned from an overpriced Williamsburg rack.)</p>
<p>With a traditional framework capable of supporting layers added by co-producers Kevin McMahon and Thomas, on <i>Almanac</i> they further pursue <i>Widowspeak</i>'s lines of inquiry into mariachi, spaghetti western soundtracks, and 90s sad-rock, to a certain extent abandoning their original goal to <a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/widowspeak-gun-shy/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""hang back as much as possible."" </a>They coalesce the darker elements that hung around <i>Widowspeak </i>like an ether into something more tangible. Growling, they stalk through the album, bringing ""Rhiannon""-like undertones to ""Dyed In the Wool"" and a sense of inevitable malevolence to the psych-leaning ""Locusts"". A new focus on low-range brings out even more of the ""creepy Disney soundtrack folk group""-- Hamilton's original idea for a band called Widow's Peak-- behind the spidery banjo and baroque accordions in ""Thick as Thieves"". </p>
<p>Hamilton's interest in eschatology also influenced the record, which she wanted to record before the forecasted Mayan apocalypse: on the churning ""The Dark Age"", she preaches, ""We have ourselves to blame/ We had our years to play.../ It's getting kind of late/ Don't know what you're waiting for."" It's an electric song, with Thomas' guitar solo bursting to the surface like a churchgoer being released from possession by Hamilton's priest. ""Ballad of the Golden Hour"" turns on another epic shift, segueing seamlessly but suddenly from a slide guitar's anthemic strumming to something more sinister. Before the bridge, Thomas starts climbing up and down the scale with predatory guitar licks until Hamilton slows down the song's verse and rhythm. Her use of indelibly associated phrases like ""as the crow flies,"" ""as good as gold,"" and ""long in the teeth"" punctuate the song with almost cinematographic vividness, although it's a pity they come at the expense of subtler lyrical moments elsewhere like the double entendre ""We made the bed/ And built our legs.""</p>
<p>Those moments of instrumental and idiomatic grandeur suggest that Widowspeak is almost mythologizing itself, especially during <i>Almanac</i>'s more experimental second half, in which each song renders genre staples so effectively they listen like remastered B-sides. ""Minnewaska"" sways between Hamilton's soothing background sighs and samples of crickets, and she breathes over the ethereal torpidity of ""Storm King"" in the vein of Nancy Sinatra's version of ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"". Even ""Sore Eyes"", which comes the closest to <i>Widowspeak</i>'s tumbleweed romanticism, intimates the band's expanded representation of itself, not unlike a cover. This is <i>Almanac</i>'s greatest strength and also its weakness. Widowspeak is moving forward in its evolution as a band with promising conviction, but at this point they're exploring a lot of different paths. Without a singular narrative to tie it all together besides Hamilton's lovely but noncommital exhalations, it's a little too easy to lose interest. Now that the end of the world is behind us, however, Widowspeak can focus more precisely on how they'd like to be remembered.</p></div>"|17551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17551-almanac/|7.3|Harley Brown

The band, a long-running side project for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1324-eleventh-dream-day/"">Eleventh Dream Day</a>'s Douglas McCombs, had stiffened up, sometimes getting lost in a welter of meticulously constructed electronics. But 10 years later, things are markedly different. McCombs has lost bass player and longstanding Brokeback member Noel Kupersmith, and has mostly shed the jazz and electronic leanings of past records under this name. Instead, he's assembled a simple guitar-bass-drums lineup, perhaps deciding he'd reached a point of no return for the post-rock template he partly had a hand in defining. This album unhurriedly shifts through themes-- notably the Duane-Eddy-meets-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"">Morricone</a> feel that's something of a signature for McCombs-- but at its center it's all ragged glory, guys banging out riffs and solos, a clear-cut delve into the rock firmament. You can practically feel the band members blowing the dust off their old plaid shirts and cracking open a six pack. There's nothing ""post"" about it. This is distinctly past rock. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/""></a></p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>'s work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5033-neil-young-crazy-horse/"">Crazy Horse</a> looms large over the all-instrumental <i>Black Rock</i>, with McCombs and his band digging hard into Young's preference for creating greats beds of warm, fuzzy guitar noise. A signifier of Chicago post-rock has always been its tightness, a desire to execute songs with minimal waste, drawn from a telepathic understanding between its various players. But finding such an understanding doesn't always need to result in music that can barely breathe, as demonstrated by Young's intuitive riff-trading in Crazy Horse. McCombs seems to understand that as well. It's hard not to see this record as a big sigh of relief, born out of the joy in syphoning his music through a looser framework. Even the <a href=""http://www.thrilljockey.com/thrill/Brokeback/Brokeback-and-the-Black-Rock"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">backstory</a> behind the album is overly familiar-- it's all diligent weekly practice sessions, working out the kinks in songs through live performances, lucking into an opening slot on a friends' tour (in this case, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3724-the-sea-and-cake/"">the Sea and Cake</a>). The only thing missing is a yellowing Rush poster peeling away at the corners on their studio wall.</p>
<p>Prior Brokeback albums could feel desolate-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/951-field-recordings-from-the-cook-county-water-table/""><i>Field Recordings from the Cook County Water Table</i> </a>is a stark, lonely record-- but here the tendency is toward a much fuller and brighter sound. Occasionally there are nods to the band's past, such as the twangy ""Everywhere Down Here"" from <i>Looks at the Bird</i>, which forms a thread that McCombs picks at again on ""Gold!"" from this album. The moodier side of Brokeback's music criss-crosses with some of McCombs' work elsewhere; ""Gold!"" is even a hark back to the less uptight passages of Tortoise's ""Glass Museum"". It's all much straighter, less fussy than before. There's nothing here as intricate as ""After the Internationals"" from <i>Field Recordings</i>. Instead, there are hints of the dusty trails <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/650-calexico/"">Calexico</a> have largely made their own (in the twin tracks ""Tonight at Ten"" and ""Tonight at Eleven""), and twists of neo-noir provided by an often-deployed sea of reverb (""Who is Bozo Texino?""). Mostly it's hard to escape the endless soloing, which weaves a prickly trail through the songs, swelling out to maximum effect on longer efforts such as ""Will Be Arriving"" and ""Don't Worry Pigeon"".</p>
<p>McCombs has enjoyed a varied career, often altering Brokeback radically with each passing release, so it's not a total surprise to find him bucking his tendency to deliberately work against the conventions of rock. But it's hard not to feel a little disappointed that he couldn't come up with a fresher take on the common tropes he works with here. The closing 11-minute long ""Colossus of Roads"" just sits in place, falling into the trap of sounding like a lot of fun to play, but far less enjoyable to actually sit through. Other Chicago post-rock musicians have veered close to this space before-- Bundy K. Brown's 1996 album <i>Directions </i><i>In Music</i>, recorded under the name Directions, is an excellent example of how to taper rock excesses into something more palatable. <i>The Black Rock</i> succeeds on occasion, but the weight of McCombs' past is a tough load to bear in situations like this. When you know someone is capable of giving rock a thorough disemboweling, it's hard not to think of opportunities being squandered when presented with something so forthright.<b><br/></b></p></div>"|17587.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17587-brokeback-and-the-black-rock/|6.4|Nick Neyland

The sentiment might seem a bit rich coming from a band whose debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14611-man-alive/"" target=""_blank""><i>Man Alive</i></a>, ricocheted between advertising hoarding-style proclamations like a rubberized pinball bouncing off Flubberized bumpers: If song titles like ""MY KZ, YR BF"", ""Qwerty Finger"", and ""Photoshop Handsome"" weren't a strong enough allusion to brief attention spans, then the agitated, yelpy hairpin nature of the material implied that, true to their name, Everything Everything were not men of singular focus.</p>
<p>Probably as many people hated them for it as became slavishly, delightedly addicted. If you could look past Jonathan Higgs' extreme garrulousness, <i>Man Alive</i>'s equally distracted and distracting exterior contained much scathing humor (and heartbreak) about the absurdity of modern media overload, and our disrespect for the planet. ""Chest pumped elegantly elephantine/ southern hemisphere by Calvin Klein,"" Higgs sang with weary wit on ""Photoshop Handsome"". But laughing at society forever is a hiding to becoming a low-tier <i>Vice</i> stringer, and lyrically, <i>Arc</i> realizes that, beneath those low-fat muffins that promise to change your life for five minutes, there's hell in that hand-basket.</p>
<p>The album name inadvertently nods to a biblical story about salvation; there's anything but on <i>Arc</i>, where Higgs repeatedly envisages apocalyptic situations both as payback for human irresponsibility, and out of a surprisingly binary desire to stand at the end of time and weigh up whether we did more bad than good. The beasts that populate his Bosch-like landscape are privileged guilt, apathy, generational despair, the inability to communicate, foiled aspiration, and broken homes, though they're rendered with less crash, bang, and wallop than you might expect-- touring with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2872-muse/"" target=""_blank"">Muse</a> recently didn't make EE go full conspiratorial prog lizard king, thank god.</p>
<p>The flat-out ridiculousness of <i>Man Alive</i>'s most exhilarating material is gone, and in its place a mixture of perfectly concise, moving, visceral, often funny pop singles, perhaps one too many mid-paced laments, and a couple of rounds of roiling tirades. Some welcome breathing space unites the strands; songs stick within a genre at a time, and Higgs' lyrics no longer need <i>Infinite Jest</i>-style footnotes to decode them. If the subject matter sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke/"" target=""_blank"">Thom Yorke</a>'s dinner table patter, at least it's tempered by plenty of musical larks: the percussive glottal stops and exclamations of ""Cough Cough"" are a funny, theatrical jibe at half-assed activism, ""Armourland"" is testament to anyone who's ever claimed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2705-max-tundra/"" target=""_blank"">Max Tundra</a>'s mashed vocal glitch is ripe for pop transformation, coupled with the most gorgeous, warm rush of a chorus EE have ever written: ""I wanna take you home/ And find some new joy in this autopilot life."" And Higgs' sense of cadence and consonance is strong as ever, backed up by the band's campy, musical theater backing vocals: ""So fast, hence take an arrow from your quiver or we're/ Past tense-- what's a trilobite to anyone?"" he sings on the stuttering ""Kemosabe"", underpinned by Jeremy Pritchard's rude funk bass.</p>
<p>Everything Everything's reputation for abject maximalism overlooks their unexpected ability to craft relatively tender, sad songs; the handful on <i>Man Alive</i> were as delicate but dark as the coiled rainbow on oil's surface. There are similarly unconventional, small-scale ballads on <i>Arc</i>, the best of which is ""Torso of the Week"", whose nervous, mournful verses about the literal and figurative grind of the treadmill eventually burst into a Roman candle of a chorus. ""The House is Dust"" is an atmospheric tale of divorce made ominous by Michael Spearman's cavernous drums; centerpiece ""_Arc_"" is seemingly a structural homage to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank""><i>OK Computer</i></a>'s ""Fitter Happier"", and the best employ of the luscious, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5384-hans-zimmer/"" target=""_blank"">Hans Zimmer</a>-y strings that showboat throughout the record. But violins will play sad for any old chump, and beyond the silliness and spark present on <i>Arc</i>, there's a braveness more profound than sticking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé</a>, Arvo Part, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2848-mr-bungle/"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Bungle</a> on your influences list and calling it mammy.</p>
<p>It doesn't take an analyst to deduce that the former knottiness of Higgs' lyrics might have been a smokescreen for some ineffable feeling-- for all the words, he didn't often admit to much. Throughout <i>Arc</i>, he's repeatedly crueler to himself than any critic could have been about <i>Man Alive</i>, and sinks beneath the dulled specter of male depression. The juddering, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11361-dustin-wong/"" target=""_blank"">Dustin Wong</a>-like shimmer of ""Choice Mountain"" veils him pondering reincarnation rather than submit to hopelessness; the fraught ""Feet for Hands"" (which opens with the only truly unpleasant sound on the record, a misplaced mandolin intro) asks, ""When you think of me, don't remember this/ Not a slow wane of a blinded man,"" and the sublime ""Radiant"" counters guitarist Alex Robertshaw's piercing, heart-pounding release with the mournful admission, ""I could make a difference, but I don't.""</p>
<p>Their general sense of drama and vulnerability couched within a pretty masculine idiom-- guitar rock, to be reductive-- brings to mind the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12927-queen/"" target=""_blank"">Queen</a> duped a nation into pounding a masculine chest with a feminine fist. The way that Everything Everything play against the macho, aggressive posturing of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16991-come-of-age/"" target=""_blank"">contemporaries who could care less about caring</a> should be their strongest calling card. ""Don't try to hide it! ... 'Cos it'll have you in the end,"" Higgs sings in a strong head voice on the final song, the itchy, choral anthem, ""Don't Try"". He should know; <i>Arc</i> is a brilliant lesson in not letting your neuroses become you. </p></div>"|17540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17540-arc/|7.6|Laura Snapes

It's become <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">James Yancey</a>'s signature production opus, even though the path that led him to it was laid down by a lifetime of collaboration, workshopping, and constant production in the service of other people's voices. It's the last work he created in his lifetime, released the week of his death, and yet it still feels like his music hasn't run out of time yet, whether that's down to periodic dives back into his vaults, or via the artists that've picked up inspiration and run with it to new places. It's a widely praised favorite for so many people, and yet there's something about <i>Donuts</i> that feels like such an intensely personal statement. Even attempting to engage with it objectively, setting aside the direct experience of the man who made it, doesn't entirely break through its mystique.</p>
<p>But as music, the role <i>Donuts</i> occupies is something more than the weight of its rep or impact-- or even the circumstances in which it was created, as hard as it is to separate the idea of the album's sound from the motivation of a prolific creator knowingly constructing his final work. As an album, it just gets deeper the longer you live with it, front-to-back listens revealing emotions and moods that get pulled in every direction: mournful nostalgia, absurd comedy, raucous joy, sinister intensity. There's all kinds of neat little tics and idiosyncrasies, pushing Dilla's early 00s beat-tape experiments and exchanges into compositions that tinker with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2813-thelonious-monk/"" target=""_blank"">Thelonious Monk</a>'s off-kilter timing and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3288-lee-scratch-perry/"" target=""_blank"">Lee Perry</a>'s warped fidelity. The songs on <i>Donuts</i> are like miniature lessons in how to take sample-based music and use it to build elaborate suites out of all those nagging little pieces of songs that stick with you long after you've last listened to them. There's little else in Dilla's catalog quite like it; at points, it sounds like he was busy quickly unlearning everything he'd taught himself just so he could have the experience of relearning it all again one last time.</p>
<p>While <i>Donuts</i> is best experienced as a self-contained album, <a href=""http://www.stonesthrow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stones Throw</a> has gone to the unusual step of reissuing it as a box set of 7"" singles, a format that initially comes across like a boutique novelty at the expense of practicality. If anybody owns a scuffed-up old jukebox and wants to stock it with records that recreate the feeling of recalling jumbled-up memories and mulling over them for a while, then sure, this would work great. And it's hard not to appreciate the symbolism of issuing this album on 7"" records, considering that the hospital bedside setup Yancey used to create a significant portion of <i>Donuts</i> consisted of a SP-303 hooked up to a portable 45 turntable. But is there a reason to chop one of the last 10 years' purest can't-listen-to-just-one-track experiences into pieces, especially when the target audience for this reissue likely already has a version they don't have to keep flipping over?</p>
<p>Well, think of it this way: What's your favorite song on <i>Donuts</i>? Breaking an album like this into its component tracks puts a new viewpoint on a record that's always been easy to see as a whole, and the limitations of three minutes or so per side gives individual moments more weight on their own. The rhythms of the isolated tracks can feel truncated and abrupt in this new context-- without anything to segue into, side-enders like ""Workinonit"" and ""One Eleven"" flip off like a light switch-- but it still fits the suddenness and <i>in medias res</i> editing of the album's handmade, conversational feel. And it only serves to elucidate how much Dilla could do in such a limited amount of space. He could fit a lot of off-beat meter-shifting, loop-upending false starts and jump cuts, subtle slow-build dynamics, and double-back surprises into the little 50-to-80-second vignettes. That's plenty of time to set up expectations, only to twist them around a thousand degrees.</p>
<p>There's also some clever sequencing to the sides that lets new thematic possibilities appear. Of course ""Airworks"" and ""Lightworks"" share a side to themselves, and as consecutive tracks they felt like weird companion pieces in the middle of the original album. On record, that odd pairing-- a hiccupy series of tics drawn from L.V. Johnson's classic Chicago soul, transitioning into a cheerfully odd rework of Raymond Scott's late 50s musique concrete corporate jingles-- forces those two cuts into closer quarters and highlights their shared tendency to loop vocal phrases and backbeats into knots you can't untie. Same goes for ""Two Can Win"" and ""Don't Cry"", which consecutively showcase Yancey's knack for building classic hip-hop beats out of solitary 70s R&amp;B nuggets. The choppy yet lush elegance of ""Dilla Says Go""/""Walkinonit"" and the heartbroken please-stay pleas of ""Hi.""/""Bye."" stand out in isolation, too.</p>
<p>But even without that benefit of new juxtapositions, it's still eye-opening to take each little set of songs as it comes and not sweat getting to the next one, pinpointing the inimitable technique and sample-sourcing scope of <i>Donuts</i> through certain distinct moments. Just pull out ""Geek Down"" and note how Dilla took one of the most recognizable samples in hip-hop, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7812-esg/"" target=""_blank"">ESG</a>'s ""UFO"", and found something surprising and obscure to lay it over: a 2002 7"" retro-funk b-side called ""Charlie's Theme"" released in limited numbers by an incognito <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7210-geoff-barrow/"" target=""_blank"">Geoff Barrow</a> and Adrian Utley from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"" target=""_blank"">Portishead</a>. That's in keeping with the other moments where he's clearly working with some well-used building block that every sample-based producer should know their way around-- Mountain's ""Long Red"" (""Stepson of the Clapper""); Malcolm McLaren's ""Buffalo Gals"" (""Workinonit"" and ""The Twister""); the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Beastie Boys</a>' ""The New Style"" (""The New"")-- and still finds a way to fit that piece into something uniquely <i>his</i> by drawing from an encyclopedic catalog of under-utilized funk and soul deep cuts. Even the ubiquitous siren he lifted from Mantronix feels like Dilla's sole property now-- maybe because Kurtis never thought to lay it over a mobius-strip revamp of Kool and the Gang album track ""Fruitman"" (""The Diff'rence"") or a tense, staggered piano loop cut from Martha Reeves' mid 70s post-Motown solo debut (""Thunder"").</p>
<p>If you need any extra incentive, the box set packs in some bonus material. There's a medley of tracks that share sources with <i>Donuts</i> instrumentals ""Anti-American Graffiti"" and ""Geek Down"", which were originally slated for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2751-mf-doom/"" target=""_blank"">MF DOOM</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface</a> showcase ""Sniper Elite &amp; Murder Goons"". The track shows both MCs still in post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Madvillainy</i></a>/<i>Pretty Toney</i> form, DOOM twisting internal rhymes at a ridiculous clip, Ghost still verbally sprinting like he's coming off ""Run"". And ""Signs"", originally a Fan Club release, tacks on a stand-alone postscript that hints at some of <i>Donuts</i>' brilliance, but mostly just provides a pretty straightforward (if appealing) instrumental break based off a needly organ riff and that old Syl Johnson ""Different Strokes"" grunt. The rarities are enticing, the packaging is immaculate, and the format is intriguing. But above all else, this reissue provides a good excuse to revisit an old favorite in a new light, and in the end it's still a classic no matter how you hear it-- on 45, CD, MP3, or just running through your head.</p></div>"|17510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17510-donuts-45-box-set/|10.0|Nate Patrin

The scuzz generated by this Amherst, Mass., power-trio owes more than a little something to Amherst's other, considerably more famous triad, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"" target=""_blank"">Dinosaur Jr.</a> The resemblance is, to say the least, striking; once you find out the two bands probably share an alderman, the name California X becomes either a neat bit of misdirection or an acute form of denial. But, if the stompboxed-out mix of run'n'gun hardcore, molasses-thick grunge, and burly classic rock of <i>California X</i>, the band's self-titled debut, isn't far off (geographically or otherwise) from the mess J. Mascis and company have been kicking up off-and-on for some 30 years now, well, consider this: If you could play guitar like J. Mascis, wouldn't that be a thing you'd want to do all the time?<br/><br/>I'd wager California X frontman Lemmy Gurtowsky would almost be the first to tell you he's no J. Mascis. Allow me to be the second. But the kid's good, and he works the fretboard with much the same low-effort, high-yield fury as his laconic forebear. Like Mascis, dude can certainly shred, but he typically gets more done in three notes than he does in 20. Gurtowsky careens through riff after gnarly riff, yet he's got plenty of control over his abandon, careful not to let things get away from him; grunge-wallop ""Hot Hed"" fades out on a particularly hot-sounding solo and switches in an uncharacteristically delicate piano, and it's like pouring coolant on an overheated engine. Mostly, though, <i>California X</i> just goes, roaring through one deafening, full-tilt tune, stopping briefly to catch its breath, then tearing into the next.</p>
<p>So much music that mines the moment indie-rock crashed into grunge drops D, riffs hard, moans something or other, and lets that be that. But Gurtowsky never lets himself lose sight of the song beneath all that sludge. Opener ""Sucker"" begins in distortion and ends in total triumph, its central riff climbing like it's got a flag to plant someplace tall. But it's pushed along by Gurtowsky's impassioned-- if frequently muffled-- vocals, a top-of-the-lungs plea that recalls a more excitable sort of singer than Mr. Mascis, namely Superchunk's Mac McCaughan or Japandroids' Brian King. You can't always make out what Gurtowsky's saying on <i>California X</i>, but even submerged in static, every line's a gasp, exiting his lungs in an all-fired hurry. Just as Gurtowsky wrings a lot of feeling out of a few notes, his singing conveys plenty even when the words get lost in the fray. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14697-spider-x/"" target=""_blank"">Spider X</a>"" is particularly desperate, and Gurtowsky sings ""I wait for you!"" like a guy who's never wanted to stop waiting so badly in his life. ""Spirit World"" is the kind of pop-punker Wavves would be lucky to call his own; the waterlogged post-grunge of ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14591-pond-rot/"" target=""_blank"">Pond Rot</a>"" could be the Toadies' rewrite of ""Under the Sea"". <i>California X</i> can't help but bleed together a bit, what with all the pressing tempos, the muddled vocals, and the constellation of familiar reference points. But there's elation and ennui alike shading in these songs, two qualities you can't just borrow from another band.<br/><br/>Call it pastiche, call it homage, but whatever you want to call it, California X are guilty on all charges. Does it matter? Well, sorta; originality's nice and all, but there's certainly something to be said for injecting some new feeling into an old formula. As I see it, the big difference between <i>California X</i> and Dinosaur Jr's post-reunion records is one of feeling. The last few Dinosaur LPs have been a nice reminder of what they do well. But, while they're doing a little more than just going through the motions, the fire that drove their early records-- and drove Lou Barlow from the band-- just isn't there like it once was. <i>California X</i>, in contrast, is the kind of frantic, desperate record that hits you squarely in the gut. It's far from perfect, but it's never less than driven, and that drive gets you past the garbled syllables and any pesky feelings of deja vu. Riffs, you can cop from almost anyplace, but passion? You have to supply that one yourself. Turns out California X's passion is way louder than their piety.</p></div>"|17519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17519-california-x/|7.8|Paul Thompson

As such, it does not account for a record like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14040-stuck-on-nothing/"" target=""_blank"">Free Energy</a>'s <i>Love Sign. </i>It's certainly difficult to imagine anyone being lukewarm about it: the Philadelphia band's unyieldingly and unrepentantly shiny, happy jukebox hero-rock either predates or ignores all tenets of punk, and if you hold certain indie ideals sacred, it is likely the antithesis of everything you want out of music. Conversely, you might think those very tenets make a band like Free Energy a necessary counterbalance. So the question gets flipped: when a record that so desperately wants to be universally loved ends up being divisive, is it doing something <i>wrong</i>? Well, the current state of the music industry certainly couldn't support <i>anyone</i>'s ambition to be the new Cheap Trick, but <i>Love Sign's </i>belief in the righteousness of its intentionally big, dumb songs being big, dumb and nothing else ultimately sets Free Energy up to fail.</p>
<p>Anachronism should be the least of Free Energy’s concerns: for all of the ""That 70s Band"" affectations that accompanied their occasionally charming and novel 2010 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14040-stuck-on-nothing/"" target=""_blank""><i>Stuck On Nothing</i></a>, most of <i>Love Sign </i>is actually slick, subcompact power-pop that traces its lineage from the Cars (without the jittery, new wave idiosyncrasies) to <i>Blue Album </i>Weezer (without the emotional reckoning) to Jimmy Eat World (without the generous heart), and unfortunately, back to latter day Weezer in how it aggressively cops to its own formulism as a preemptive strike against critique. And do they ever love those groovy girls who just want to dance all night. That last part is important: seemingly every other song makes some sort of reference to dancing or shaking it all night, but only one is actually called ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48142-free-energy-detail-new-album-share-track/"" target=""_blank"">Dance All Night</a>"".</p>
<p>It's a powerful image to conjure, particularly when it has absolutely no currency with what most would consider ""youth music"" in 2013 and could be all the more attractive for it. But in the context of <i>Love Sign, </i>you have to imagine a version of <i>Dazed and Confused </i>that removes any and all references to sex (a lyric about ""making out with your lipstick gloss"" is as close as you get to second base), drugs, or antiauthoritarian behavior. Which leaves you with basically a five-minute short about getting Aerosmith tickets. The fatal flaw of <i>Love Sign</i> is its failure to realize ""good clean fun"" is a contradiction in youth-oriented rock. If so much of Free Energy's praise thus far has taken to the theoretical-- you could totally hear it coming out of an airbrushed van! These could all be hits in 1975!-- it's because none of it feels inspired by anything resembling a real human interaction.</p>
<p>You don't have to look any further back than Japandroids' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16564-japandroids-celebration-rock/"" target=""_blank""><i>Celebration Rock </i></a>for proof that lyrics don't have to be based in reality to trigger very real and very powerful emotions and that the best antidote to crippling nostalgia is the belief that <i>tonight could really be the best night ever</i>. But Free Energy offer nothing of themselves but the most obvious rhymes possible between the most obviously placed ""whoas"" and ""heys"" in a way that feels borderline insulting to the listener. This carries over to the music as well; for a bunch of self-styled classicists, their depth and appreciation for 70s pop-rock seems to go no further than the exact sounds and signifiers that would be coopted by a commercial for a free credit report, all of which makes John Agnello's plasticine production uncomfortably on-the-nose. It's possible that hearing a cowbell or a harmonized guitar solo or any of the riffs that could pass for slight variations of ""You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet"" can still trigger a smile. Yet, by pushing these buttons as often as possible, they become nothing more than Spike Jones-style audio gags. </p>
<p>That's not to suggest Free Energy are being cynical or opportunistic on <i>Love Sign; </i>there are much easier ways to achieve stardom in 2013 than to self-release an album of this nature. It <i>is</i> sincere-- the way your drunk uncle sincerely wants to make you laugh when he tells an off-color joke, the way a guy who uses a pickup line at a bar sincerely wants to sleep with you. But when you consider the far more dubious genres privy to salvage jobs as of late, the problem isn't the form so much as the utter void of expression. You think back to similarly minded bands that punctured indie's inflated sense of self and the kitsch quickly gave way to an underlying, unshakeable vision. Sloan had the encyclopedic knowledge and chops to serve as satisfying meta exercise <i>and </i>compete with the power-pop originals, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1191-the-darkness/"" target=""_blank"">the Darkness</a> juxtaposed the groupie-slaying connotations of their music with incredibly nerdy puns about STDs, masturbation, and RPGs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2218-junior-senior/"" target=""_blank"">Junior Senior</a> traded in subversive and very non-subversive sexual politics, Andrew WK didn't make a record so much as a code of ethics. Then again, Free Energy may have done the same thing; their first album merely took the phrase ""stuck on nothing"" as its title. <i>Love Sign </i>actually lives it.</p></div>"|17530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17530-love-sign/|3.6|Ian Cohen

But New Orleans has shifted off to the side recently. Master P, Juvenile, Mystikal, and other assorted characters from those labels have tried to rediscover their careers in the blog era with little success, while you're more likely nowadays to hear about New Orleans in the music of Drake than Lil Wayne. But the most devastating blow to the city's viability came when the prolific Lil Boosie, a Baton Rouge native who nonetheless assumed the crown as New Orleans' hometown hero, went to jail in 2010.</p>
<p>The artists of Trill Ent., the label that housed Boosie and was responsible for the city's vitality after Wayne moved to Miami, have since lost their relevance-- with one notable exception. Mouse on tha Track is a producer by trade-- he was behind the boards for the label's true pop crossover tracks like ""Wipe Me Down"" and ""Independent""-- but he's turned to rapping recently, maybe out of necessity. His 2011 mixtape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15126-swagga-fresh-freddie/"" target=""_blank""><i>Swagga Fresh Freddie </i></a>was eye-opening for reviving bounce music, long the backbone of the New Orleans rap scene. But <i>Millionaire Dreamzzz</i>, released as 2012 wound down, raises the bar. It displays a Mouse that has come into his own as an MC, reliant less on what he is reviving and more on his own personality. </p>
<p><i>Swagga Fresh Freddie </i>is still a whippit of delirious fun, but <i>Millionaire Dreamzzz </i>makes it sound quaint. Where Mouse once occupied a role in his music similar to that of classic bounce MCs who would freestyle call-and-response chants over beats, he has now moved closer to crafting actual rap songs. The model is still more or less the same, but Mouse has a noticeable confidence in himself that he didn't have before. On songs off the previous tape like ""Biznezz is Biznezz"" or ""Stupid Like Them Hoes"", it sounded like he was having trouble finding his footing over the jitteriness of beats that spurt every which way, or as if he had chosen vocal takes at random.</p>
<p>But <i>Millionaire Dreamzzz </i>immediately makes it clear that something has changed. On second track ""I'm About It"", Mouse calmly settles into a lithe sing-song flow that turns the track into one three and a half minute hook. On ""Hand Rub"", he flips <a href=""http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/birdman%20handrub"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a meme</a> into a piston-shifting party anthem with multiple choruses that weaves vocal samples into the beat without getting overpowered by them. That track is emblematic of how Mouse has changed with his second tape-- his beats are still bonkers, but now they're in service of something greater than just sounding wild. He is not vying for attention or at odds with his beats-- the Mouse of <i>Millionaire Dreamz </i>has harnessed his greatest asset. </p>
<p class=""p1"">But more than anything he is rounding into a viable solo artist thanks to his growth as a vocalist. Two of the album's best tracks are stuck on the end of what is already a long tape, but they prove more than any tracks that Mouse isn't a one-trick wonder. ""Sip Some Moet"" and ""Millionaire Dreaming"" are basically R&amp;B songs, but they're also logical extensions of what Mouse does throughout the tape. His endlessly catchy playground flow shifts from sing-song to just singing, allowing his songwriting to shine. R&amp;B is not Mouse's endgame, but the tracks offer that there's still more to come from this unlikely torchbearer.</p></div>"|17528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17528-millionaire-dreamzzz/|7.6|Jordan Sargent

""He's a fucking outlaw,"" Gallagher says. ""He's the best producer I've ever worked with, ever."" If that's not the definitive sign that the dinosaurs of Manchester's music scene are keeling to a cold wave, the Ouroboros finally spitting out its own tail in favor of a more challenging palette, then the fact that most of the city's emerging young bands pay no heed to the legacy of Oasis, the Stone Roses, or even much post-punk, is one on the scoreboard for evolution. At the forefront of the sea change are <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29041-everything-everything/"" target=""_blank"">Everything Everything</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30873-dutch-uncles/"" target=""_blank"">Dutch Uncles</a>, and both their wonky, brainy strands of pop take delight in disassembly: EE like to pull the body asunder to see how we work; Dutch Uncles splay language to look between the lines.</p>
<p>Over the past century, messages have been divided into zeroes and ones for purposes of primitive transmission, encoded secrets, S.O.S. signals; the title of Dutch Uncles' third album, <i>Out of Touch in the Wild</i>, implies that the five-piece might need to make a few of the latter calls. But the record isn't a portrait of some haphazard attempt at going full <i>Walden</i>; the wilderness here concerns the lesser visited extremes of domesticity-- the deep waters of infatuation suddenly turning dark, and watching friends succumb to drugs, the addiction to mind fireworks extinguishing whatever external spark they once had. To make sense of the smeariness of these experiences, Dutch Uncles stick to a rigidly pointillist, exacting scheme of glassy, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"" target=""_blank"">Reichian</a> xylophone and marimba, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Talk Talk</a>-y guitar ticks, and choppy Stravinsky-inspired string sections, for a prismatic take on herky-jerky pop that approaches complex situations like a beguiling data visualization.</p>
<p><i>Out of Touch</i> is far from all head without heart, but singer and pianist Duncan Wallis' primary lyrical and emotional defense mechanism-- and that's the primary position from which he sings-- is to clam up for sake of keeping the peace. ""There's a time to hide everything/ The way that you are, where you've been,"" he sings at the start of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14539-fester/"" target=""_blank"">""Fester""</a>, an ominous sign that even the record's creators might have held it at arms' length. But tiny clues emerge: ""The times I hide behind a smile/ That says you were right/ You were always right,"" betrays a sardonic acceptance of the futility of trying to argue, while the rigidly rhythmic xylophone tings are undercut with a palpable sense of agitation; like watching someone give an important speech while failing to subtly relieve an itch caused by their suit.</p>
<p>The band have specified the meaning of a few of the songs-- the spinning, baroque ""Godboy"" is about a friend's hopeless death, the wonky funk of ""Bellio"" concerns the first taste of an intense sensation-- but you'd be hard pushed to tell. ""Thematically it's just saying, I'm fucked, I don't know what's going on,"" Wallis has said, and lines like, ""Never has it been so long since thoughts consoled/ But the reason that came before is gone,"" from ""Phaedra"" (think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4360-shugo-tokumaru/"" target=""_blank"">Shugo Tokumaru</a> covering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7372-wild-beasts/"" target=""_blank"">Wild Beasts</a>) function like wordy shields protecting an ineffable sensation. The constant tip-toeing around emotion is frustrating, the effect coming off like a message broken in transmission.</p>
<p>However, the main appeal of <i>Out of Touch in the Wild</i> is how Dutch Uncles have succeeded in their goal of making a proper ""studio record."" The fragmented texture of the songs doesn't allow it to slip into bland slickness, but it's clean, theatrical, and kookily conservatorial in a pretty satisfying fashion, if occasionally a little too keen to change tacks within a single song. ""Threads"" begins with cascades of xylophone and marimba, as if running through a beaded curtain emporium, its tonal shifts steered by stealthily deployed bass lines; ""Nometo"" riffles through whooshing, regal phases with a similar anachronistic virtuosity to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1646-field-music/"" target=""_blank"">Field Music</a>, and closer ""Brio"" forsakes dense pointillism for a slurpy, stuttering take on krautrock that acts as something of a relieving coda after all that agitation and anxiety. If there's one thing that's universal about this addictively jittering, nervy bunch, it's that Dutch Uncles fully understand that one of the only ways to manage overwhelming experiences is to implement a sense of structure and routine-- even if you know it's just a facade.</p></div>"|17431.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17431-out-of-touch-in-the-wild/|7.3|Laura Snapes

Back in 2009, when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1826-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Girls</a> first emerged, Owens' long, greasy locks seemed to serve a strategic purpose: They formed a thick veil behind which he could seek sanctuary, as he exposed the pain and longing that fuelled attention-seizing early singles like ""Lust for Life"" and ""Hellhole Ratrace"". The mesmerizing qualities of hair certainly weren't lost on Owens, who gave the name ""Curls"" to a blissful instrumental on Girls' debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13477-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>Album</i></a>, and who used the lead-off track on 2011's follow-up, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15811-father-son-holy-ghost/"" target=""_blank""><i>Father, Son, Holy Ghost</i></a>, to reassert his ""dirty hair"" as an outsider status symbol. But Owens treated the more nakedly confessional songs of <i>Father, Son, Holy Ghost</i> as an opportunity to clean up his visage; the tours for that album saw him more comfortably settle into the role of bandleader, facing the crowds and <a href="" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6aXK39qVQ"" target=""_blank"">late-night TV-show cameras</a> straight-on through a neatly parted, tidily trimmed coiffure.</p>
<p>So it's rather curious that 0n the cover of his first release since Girls' surprising dissolution, Owens appears to be both ready for his close-up yet eager to use his mangy mane as a barrier. It's but the first of many contradictions that define the equally fascinating and frustrating <i>Lysandre</i>, a narrative concept album that runs a mere 29 minutes and is both more musically ornate yet somehow also slighter than anything Girls attempted, a deeply personal work whose arch presentation serves to keep you at an emotional distance.</p>
<p>When an artist opts to release a record under their own name, there's often the implication that songs will be more autobiographical and introspective. But where Girls provided Owens with a vehicle to translate his uniquely fucked-up life experiences into affirming, universal anthems, <i>Lysandre</i> presents very specific details of a particular moment in Owens' life-- complete with names, locations, and copious references to his singer-songwriter vocation-- in a more contrived setting. It's as if he were staging a dramatized meta-musical about his life. On the opening address <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14498-here-we-go/"" target=""_blank"">""Here We Go""</a>, Owens sings, ""If your heart is broken/ You will find fellowship with me"" as if introducing himself to the audience as a character in his own play, the song's serene, pastoral-folk finger-picking and titular command signaling the dimming of the house lights.</p>
<p>Owens <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9007-chris-owens/"" target=""_blank"">recently admitted</a> to Pitchfork that <i>Lysandre</i> is an album that he just had to get out of his system, presumably to bring proper closure to the romantic relationship that blossoms and flames out (in inverse relation to Owens' ascendant musical career) over the course of the record. Though divided into 11 tracks, <i>Lysandre</i> functions as a single, continuous piece, with a recurring instrumental motif (""Lysandre's Theme"") serving as a thread and reinforcing that sense of feeling haunted by a memory. But if the story of <i>Lysandre</i> is so significant to Owens that it demanded its own song cycle, his musical treatments don't always do the material justice.</p>
<p>On Girls' albums, Owens undercut the sense of despair with moments of levity, but <i>Lysandre</i> overemphasizes the latter quality to the point of undermining the sensitive subject matter. The chirpy flute lines that cut through ""Here We Go"" and the buoyant title track cross the line from classy embellishment to garish distraction, and the disarming portraits of poverty, desperation, and violence that run through ""New York City"" are neutered by an oddly upbeat execution that confuses <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osOq7G-fiY8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground's idea of rock 'n' roll</a> with that of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIJNoeDyrV8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Huey Lewis</a>, thanks to an interminably goofy sax solo that oversells the optimism of starting life anew in the Big Apple. But even those transgressions don't quite prepare you for ""Riviera Rock"", a transitional mid-album ersatz-Santana jam that apparently signifies some unexplained tropical-getaway plot turn, but comes off like a tiki-lounge act's introducing-the-band segment.</p>
<p>Owens is keenly aware of the risks he's taking with <i>Lysandre</i>: Though the insecurities expressed on the winsome ""Love Is in the Ear of the Listener""-- ""What if everybody just thinks I'm a phony/ What if nobody ever gets it?""-- may stem from his early-career stage fright, they're just as trenchant now that he's derailed a much-loved and increasingly popular band to go solo. But the songwriting is rarely a problem on <i>Lysandre</i>: The dolorous acoustic ballads ""A Broken Heart"" and ""Everywhere You Knew"" show that Owens' command of understated devastation remains unparalleled, using simple, seemingly mundane imagery to set unspeakably intimate scenes of awkward first kisses and airport farewells. And the excellent closer ""Part of Me (Lysandre's Epilogue)"" brings this occasionally gaudy album to a refreshingly grounded conclusion, forsaking the baroque flourishes in favour of a <i>Harvest</i>-worthy harmonica refrain and gently rollicking country rhythm. ""You were a part of me/ That part of me is gone,"" Owens sings with a combination of sadness and relief, bidding farewell to his girl, or Girls, or maybe just to that part of him that was itching to make a prog-folk concept album overstuffed with sax and flutes. At the very least, Owens emerges from the other side of <i>Lysandre</i> sounding liberated, and ready to brush that hair out of his eyes once again.</p></div>"|17529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17529-lysandre/|6.5|Stuart Berman

That's not a slam against RGC's previous releases, just that <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11317-retribution-gospel-choir/"" target=""_blank"">Retribution Gospel Choir</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13841-2/"" target=""_blank"">2</a></i>, and last year's aggressively minor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5700-retribution-gospel-choir/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Revolution </i>EP</a> were likeable stabs at classic-rock posturing that never really took. For all the sincere affection Alan Sparhawk clearly has for heavy-riffing songs rooted in AOR conventions-- he even dug out a cowbell for <i>The Revolution-</i>- it always seemed more like play-acting than a truly natural guise. There was no question about his desire to write visceral rock songs; what was debatable was whether he was any good at it.</p>
<p><i>3 </i>is the ultimate RGC record, and the ultimate departure, composed of just two songs-- recorded live in the studio in one take-- that each run in the neighborhood of 20 minutes. It's a bit of a shock coming after <i>The Revolution</i>, the slickest and hookiest RGC record to date, not to mention the shtickiest. The soft-rock affectations of recent Low records like 2011's <i>C'mon </i>got the funhouse mirror treatment on <i>The Revolution</i>, with RGC verging awkwardly on full-blown power-pop and self-conscious 70s rock cheese. <i>3 </i>is a wilder, woolier, and yet more coherent beast.</p>
<p>Just when RGC seemed to be turning into a borderline jokey chaser for Sparhawk's more thoughtful work in Low, <i>3 </i>takes a sharp 180-degree turn toward some of the deepest, most exploratory music he's yet made under the moniker. It<i> </i>satisfies Sparhawk's need to crank up the amps away from Low while at the same time retaining the mastery of atmosphere and subtly evolving soundscapes that distinguishes his better known band. ""Can't Walk Out"" is a fearsome, nearly wordless squall of freeform fury, with Sparhawk oscillating between barely contained chaos and a hard-charging groove that swings between <i>Live at Leeds </i>and <i>A Tribute to Jack Johnson. </i>The point of RGC until now has been about releasing the energy that Low keeps under wraps. But ""Can't Walk Out"" builds a head of steam and turns it in on itself; the tension only increases as Sparhawk's guitar rages over the stormy, thoroughly submerged rhythms supplied by bassist Steve Garrington and drummer Eric Pollard. The final result is a thing of thrilling, terrifying beauty, like a tornado held on the horizon at a safe distance.</p>
<p>The other track, ""Seven"", is relatively catchy, though it goes on for a minute longer. ""Seven"" occasionally wanders back to a pretty folk-rock chorus that's as bleary-eyed as the simple melody that RGC mangles, mends, and mangles again during a sprawling, extemporaneous jam. The wobbly guitar lines that drop into the mix unmistakably belong to special guest star Nels Cline, who exhibits a similar telepathy with Sparhawk that he shares on-stage with Jeff Tweedy in Wilco. For long, wondrous stretches in the back half of ""Seven"", Cline and Sparhawk lock in to form a breathtaking duet of feedback and slow-motion soloing.</p>
<p>The obvious companion to <i>3 </i>is last year's Neil Young and Crazy Horse double-LP, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17213-psychedelic-pill/"" target=""_blank"">Psychedelic Pill</a>. </i>Sparhawk certainly isn't afraid to let his songs go on as long as Young does, and his excellent guitar playing is worthy of comparison to one of rock's all-time great sludgy shape-shifters. But <i>3 </i>also warrants a nod to<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"" target=""_blank""> Low</a>; it's surprising how well the high points of this record line up with Low's strong suits.</p>
<p>The best parts of Low albums often occur in the spaces between the music; few bands are as good about not filling every cubic inch with sound, allowing the listener to settle in and find their own place inside the songs. Retribution Gospel Choir have achieved the same quality on <i>3</i>; the landscape is thornier, but equally vast, formless, and inviting for ample exploring over multiple listens. Before now, Retribution Gospel Choir records were a little too straight-forward, spilling all of the information they had to offer too quickly. On <i>3</i>, they've turned up the noise without spoiling the mystery.</p></div>"|17533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17533-3/|7.5|Steven Hyden

It's a familiar scene to anyone who's at least tangentially familiar with Jeezy's dense discography. Cranky disappointment is one of his two default emotional settings (the other being an extreme case of Thinks He's Tony Montana Syndrome), and as the years without a hit to match the success of visceral anthems like ""Go Crazy"" and ""My President is Black"" add up, it's become the dominant mood on recent releases, as on 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16140-thug-motivation-103-hustlerz-ambition/"" target=""_blank""><i>TM103: Hustlerz Ambition</i></a>.</p>
<p>So aside from its faux-exotic instrumentation (a vaguely old-timey-Mexican combination of flamenco-style guitar and tambourine), ""El Jefe Intro"" pretty much sets up <i>It's Tha World</i> as yet another one of the decently executed but ultimately uninspiring releases that have typified the ""Larry Fishburne beard""-era of Jeezy's career. The several tracks following it only seem to confirm that suspicion-- making the synthesized bass riff underpinning track eight, ""RIP"", something of a surprise.</p>
<p>""RIP"" has a lot going for it, including a beat by ""Rack City"" producer DJ Mustard that owes an obvious debt to 80s LA electro funk, and a guest appearance by professional song-improver <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"" target=""_blank"">2 Chainz</a>, but its most remarkable quality is that Jeezy is very clearly having a good time here. He dips around the bassline with a nimbleness we haven't heard from him in years, tosses off references to Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh, and uses his trademark ""ha-haaa"" ad lib to express actual pleasure, rather than the ghoulish irony for which he usually deploys it. Suddenly it's easy to remember why you downloaded all of those less than satisfying mixtapes in the first place: because when he's fully engaged, Young Jeezy is still one of the most talented rappers working.</p>
<p>The combination of DJ Mustard and heavy throwback vibes seems to suit Jeezy especially well. A couple of tracks after ""RIP"" is another Mustard-produced slow-burner, ""All the Same"", where Jeezy teams up with fellow proudly grown-ass rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"" target=""_blank"">E-40</a>, who kicks off his verse paraphrasing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7234-krs-one/"" target=""_blank"">KRS-One </a>and spends the rest of it bemusedly recounting the ways in which younger rappers high on their own success have messed up their situations. For a while now, E-40 has been perfecting a philosophy that Jeezy seems to be coming around to: the best way for an artist now beyond their most marketable years to compete against the hot new things is to simply declare themselves out of their league, and to act and create accordingly.</p>
<p>Not to give the impression that Young Jeezy's shopping for a La-Z-Boy and a spot in a retirement community. While ""RIP"", ""All the Same"", the frictionless, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29155-warren-g/"" target=""_blank"">Warren G</a>-produced ""Just Got Word"", and the fantastically nasty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10706-trey-songz/"" target=""_blank"">Trey Songz</a>-assisted sex jam ""Tonight"" are badass in their own not-giving-a-fuck kind of way, Jeezy also takes time out to prove that he can still be badass in the ways he's best known for. ""Damn Liar"" is a vicious diss track so huge and mean that, instead of aiming it at just one rival, Jeezy uses it to call out reams of rappers. And ""Turn Up or Die"" comes closer than maybe any other song in years to nailing the intoxicating combination of hedonism and nihilism that made the rap world fall in love with ""Go Crazy"" in the first place.</p>
<p>After a run of songs like that, it's easy to forgive Jeezy for essentially tacking two outro numbers onto the end of the tape-- one of which is called ""Thank Me"", about how grateful we should all be to have him around. He's obviously been very deeply into the zone, and coming down from that sometimes takes two outro songs. They're basically afterthoughts, but it's still easy for a listener to finish the mixtape in a way that Jeezy hasn't made them feel in a while: already hungry for the next one.</p></div>"|17518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17518-its-tha-world/|7.4|Miles Raymer

Lennon has had a solo career since the mid-90s and is, of course, the son of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, but to read the press materials for this project's debut, you wouldn't know that if you didn't already know his name. He's billed as ""Sean Lennon (The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger),"" as though his membership in the folky duo he performs in with girlfriend Charlotte Kemp Muhl is the one thing for which he's best known. (For comparison, Saunier is billed as ""Greg Saunier (Deerhoof)."")</p>
<p>Being the son of legends does confer certain advantages on a musician, though I think that's all but wiped out by the baggage that also comes with it. This sort of ""he's in another band, I'm in another band"" statement on the part of Chimera Records, co-owned by Lennon and Muhl, feels like a reaction to that: They're selling Lennon on a musical accomplishment rather than name. Which is fair, especially considering the nature of Mystical Weapons, which is not anything like Lennon's solo records or GoaSTT. It's a 36-minute set of proggy instrumental improvisations that's fairly accessible as these things go, but certainly not the kind of thing anyone would have expected from the guy who did ""Parachute"" and ""Dead Meat"".</p>
<p>Most of the pieces are short-- nearly half are under two minutes-- and they range quite a bit in tone and feel. The most immediately gripping is ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14729-colony-collapse-disorder/"" target=""_blank"">Colony Collapse Disorder</a>"", an airy track with swelling keyboards that sounds a little like it could've been recorded in Germany in 1972. Saunier's drumming brings to mind the lose-the-groove approach of U.S. Maple, backing away every time it approaches a steady pulse. While this piece is moody and highly charged, others are sketchier or outright chaotic. ""Gross Domestic Happiness"" begins agreeably, but by the time you get four minutes in, it's a screaming vortex of guitar noise, clattering percussion, and evil synthesizer.</p>
<p>Lennon and Saunier meld well over most of the album, and the most inspired moments are great. The way Saunier at first meets Lennon's weird keyboard phrases in a similar rhythm, then completely changes the emphasis to give the piece a whole different feel on ""Goddess Curlers"" is one good example. This is, ultimately, a record of the moment, though, and not one likely to leave any melodies lingering in your head. Deerhoof fans will have to make a much shorter leap to get into this than fans of Lennon's solo work, but in either case, it's missing the anchors of voice, melody, and songwriting that characterize both discographies. There's plenty to love on <i>Mystical Weapons</i>, but it's not a casual listen, and it's best not to expect one.</p></div>"|17531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17531-mystical-weapons/|7.0|Joe Tangari

The album's opening track, ""Signposts and Instruments"" still stands as the Baltimore-based quartet's finest moment-- an ethereal dirge that seems far more otherworldly and bizarre than the its handful of slow-mo power chords should allow for. Delivered in an echo-laden whisper, singer/guitarist Dave Heumann imparted verses that sounded like the kind of stuff you'd find scrawled in a dream journal. If you're among those who hated groups like Band of Horses for their ordinary, work-a-day, lovey-dovey-ness, the doom-shrouded folk-moves on <i>Rites of Uncovering</i> had an appeal.</p>
<p>In the years since, the band's struggled to strike a similar compromise between spirit-world imagery and Americana-tinged bar-rock. On their subsequent records, Arbouretum fortified its heavier inclinations. They became a tighter and louder band-- dialing in gritty fuzz tones and extending the free-form freak-outs beyond the 10-minute range-- but as the music's density increased, the haunting vacuum that defined <i>Rites </i>got squashed.</p>
<p>On <i>Coming Out of the Fog</i>, the band's new album, Arbouretum's eerier inclinations are back in alignment with their amplifiers. As a lyricist, Heumann favors heavy subject matter-- suffering, isolation, mortal man's impossible struggle against natural or supernatural forces-- and he often saturates each line with a mouthful of syllables. ""I've no need of lampreys now nor the funerary ode,"" he sang on ""Tonight's a Jewel"", arguably the most light-hearted number on <i>Rites of Uncovering</i>. In <i>Fog</i>'s quieter stretches, he manages to pack that broad spiritual sweep into simpler phrases. On the pedal steel-driven ""Oceans Don't Sing"", Heumann sets a concrete scene-- longing for beach-side serenity-- before slipping into impressionistic language.</p>
<p>Heumann still whips out esoteric lines, but he reserves his heaviest poetry for the band's noisiest and most repetitive music, where it can sit comfortably atop the battering, barely shifting grooves. On ""World Split Open"" the band rides a single grinding riff for all it's worth, while Heumann hurls out heady and arcane couplets. </p>
<p>As a guitarist, Heumann channels a number of inspired shredders-- Neil Young, Richard Thompson, and even Western Saharan outfits, like Group Doueh-- but as a songwriter, he's the product of two influences: singer Will Oldham, with whom he toured as a backing guitarist, and Baltimore punk-rock-Gnostics, Lungfish, whose drummer Mitchell Feldstein has done time behind the kit for Arbouretum. The former provided a blueprint for his hyper-cerebral lyrics and staid melodies. The latter, pretty much everything else-- the sea chantey rhythms, the cyclical riffage, and any/all of his mystical tendencies. On <i>Fog</i>, Arbouretum does well by both parties.</p></div>"|17496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17496-coming-out-of-the-fog/|6.9|Aaron Leitko

These records were sprawling yet intimate, stylistically all over the map yet purposefully constructed. And whether they took the form of earwax-melting noise freakouts or bossa nova lullabies, they always projected the unmistakable, endearing personalities of their makers. But technological changes over the past decade have rendered the mix-tape (or CD-R) an outmoded concept as the shuffled playlist has become the cornerstone of our contemporary listening habits. What was once a unique, painstakingly assembled listening experience has become our default mode.</p>
<p>And true to their quietly contrarian, trend-averse nature, Yo La Tengo have responded to our accelerated, quick-click culture with a more patient approach: Since 2000's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8870-and-then-nothing-turned-itself-inside-out/"" target=""_blank""><i>And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out</i></a>, their albums have mostly favoured calming consistency over unpredictable pastiche, while their more outre interests have been redirected toward side projects (see: the garage-punk goofiness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12819-fuckbook/"" target=""_blank"">Condo Fucks</a>) or improvised soundtrack work (2002's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8865-the-sounds-of-the-sounds-of-science/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Sounds of the Sounds of Science</i></a>). And even though their most recent releases have shown a renewed interest in stretching songs past the 10-minute mark, these extended pieces are segregated from the more pop-oriented material on the tracklist, serving as bookends (2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9397-i-am-not-afraid-of-you-and-i-will-beat-your-ass/"" target=""_blank""><i>I Am Not Afraid of You and I Will Beat Your Ass</i></a>) or shunted off to separate sides of vinyl (2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"" target=""_blank""><i>Popular Songs</i></a>). </p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/advance/1-fade/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fade</i></a> takes the refinement process one step further, revisiting the brief, breezy-listening forms of <i>Popular Songs</i>' first two sides, but lopping off the backloaded free-form excursions entirely. And at a tight 10 songs and 46 minutes, it's the band's shortest album since 1990's <i>Fakebook</i>. But none of that is to suggest <i>Fade</i> is any more slight than its heftier predecessors. Even as Yo La Tengo lean to their quieter side here, the band's sense of playfulness comes through. Produced by John McEntire, <i>Fade</i> lets you appreciate the complexity of its simplicity. It may trod over some familiar turf-- Georgia Hubley's fuzz-pop standout ""Paddle Forward"" squeezes another drop of blood from ""Sugarcube""-- but the relaxed pacing and pleasing melodies belie just how much action is really going on beneath the serene surfaces.</p>
<p>Truth is, <i>Fade</i> can be every bit as adventurous as the band's most eclectic albums, but applies its myriad layers in more subtle fashion: The opening ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"" target=""_blank"">Ohm</a>"" locks into its shuffling, clap-along tabla-funk groove and repetitive, corrosive jangle riff for its full six-minute-plus duration, before gradually thickening the guitar noise and organ drone until the anodyne group-unison vocals transform from monotone to mantra. Centerpiece track ""Stupid Things"" is even more sublime, beginning with some tranquil, exploratory guitar noodling from Ira Kaplan that summons a brushed-snare beat resembling a krautrock skiffle, and sets its chorus aflight on a pillowy bed of strings. And the hazy, soft-focus balladry of ""Two Trains"" is beautifully bent out of shape by a wobbly, dubwise rhythm.</p>
<p>As ever, Kaplan and Georgia Hubley's lyrics assume the form of overheard, one-way conversations between intimates falling in and out of love. And even in <i>Fade</i>'s most sanguine moments, there's a sense of unease creeping into Yo La Tengo's little corner of the world. The smooth Motown-by-way-of-Thrill Jockey moves of ""Well You Better"" belie Kaplan's anxious demands (""Baby, make up your mind""); ""Is That Enough"" tries to gloss over its sense of doubt and defeat with cheeky string-section fills, but the distant, distorted guitar line buzzing in the background offers a lingering reminder of the bitterness being suppressed. <i>Fade</i> threatens to become too preoccupied with understated details during its increasingly subdued second act, and yet that sense of restraint just makes the triumphant finale ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14577-before-we-run/"" target=""_blank"">Before We Run</a>"" soar all the more gloriously, elevating Hubley's humble melody with a euphoric brass-and-string fanfare. It may not herald another big day coming, but <i>Fade</i> is a thoroughly immersive dusk-to-dawn soundtrack to a dark night's passing.</p></div>"|17501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17501-fade/|8.1|Stuart Berman

Stoned, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14678-stoned-and-starving/"" target=""_blank"">starving</a>, and maybe just a little bit irritable, they're approached by a clipboard-carrying do-gooder seeking donations. ""'A minute of YOUR time?',"" they ask co-frontman Austin Brown, who quickly sends Mr. Greenpeace off with a snide-beyond-belief ""for-GET about it"" and a (questionably apropos) reminder that Socrates died in the fucking gutter. Munchie money secure, there are far more important details to attend to: roasted peanuts or Swedish fish?</p>
<p>Parquet cohorts Brown and Andrew Savage-- also of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28047-fergus-geronimo/"" target=""_blank"">Fergus &amp; Geronimo</a>-- are slackers in an almost classical sense, conjuring up just about every post-collegiate, pre-responsibility, sativa-hoovering tendency you can think of. Their tangent-prone music flits, not always smoothly, between skittish post-punk and bedhead-riddled indie rock, a knot of Silkworm-inspired guitar tangles and insistent Wire tempos. It's wound tight but fraying at the edges. They're smart but they don't always act it. They could probably play these songs a little better if they wanted to. They're very funny, but not the kind of funny that makes you laugh much. They contradict themselves constantly. They probably wait until the afternoon to shower.</p>
<p>The tension between the sharp rhythms (courtesy of Savage's brother Max) and the ace fretwork is <i>Gold</i>'s most reliable thrill; were it not for all this forward motion from the younger Savage, there's just no telling how far afield these songs would drift. Still fresh off Fergus &amp; Geronimo's genre-hopping, indie-skewering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16903-funky-was-the-state-of-affairs/"" target=""_blank""><i>Funky Was the State of Affairs</i></a>, Savage seems considerably looser here: though F&amp;G sometimes hew too closely to constraints of their source material, here he drops the retro studiousness and gets a little weird. Of the pair, though, Brown's the real eccentric; his outburst-riddled material slot in beautifully against Savage's anthems-in-miniature. After a while, you start to see the logic in all all their rambling deflections.</p>
<p>It's not much of a stretch to hear many of of indie rock's recent go-tos-- blurry edged-production, meaning-averse lyrics-- as a form of disaffection. Times are strange, the future's rarely seemed less certain, so it's pretty easy to see the haze surrounding indie rock as a sonic counterpoint to the unfixed nature of, well, everything. Parquet Courts may be potheads but they're not head-in-the-clouds escapists. And, while there's a we're-all-fucked undercurrent running through <i>Light Up Gold</i>'s lyric sheet, Parquet Courts aren't about to take it sitting down. Mumbly highlight ""Careers in Combat"" speaks to a fairly uncomfortable reality: there are no more lifeguard jobs or decent gigs left, but hey, the military's always looking for warm bodies. Savage, on ""Yonder is Closer to the Heart"", sees the wadded receipts and spare change piled on his desk as a reminder of the mundane passage of time; later, up to his neck in ""motivation neglect,"" he unhappily admits ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14480-borrowed-time/"" target=""_blank"">these days I'm captive in this borrowed time</a>."" <i>Light Up Gold</i> finds Parquet Courts looking to breakout through any available means: intense reflection, resin hits, or rock'n'roll.</p></div>"|17405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17405-light-up-gold/|8.0|Paul Thompson

He creates toy-box indie pop with his vast collection of noise makers and a computer, and for all its obvious compositional refinement, it's still a giddy celebration of pop music's potential for mayhem. He's been doing this for a while now, with varying degrees of success, but on <i>In Focus?</i> it all comes together in a beautifully sharp series of Technicolor audio bursts.</p>
<p>This music is hard to place in context without referencing a dozen different things-- it has so many affinities lurking inside of it, from the Beach Boys to French pop in the 60s to 70s Brazilian pop to bedroom IDM, that from moment to moment it will probably remind you of something different. Tokumaru sings entirely in Japanese, which for a non-speaker has the effect of turning his breathy tenor into another instrument, threading its own melodies around the ones carried by the wood flutes and gadgets fluttering in the edges of the mix.</p>
<p>""Decorate"" has all of that, balancing frenetic verses against a sweeping, harmony-laden chorus-- at first it just sounds like a perfectly constructed indie pop confection, but turn it up a little, and a whole world of little details emerges, from wooden noise makers accenting just the right part of the beat to wood flutes played in different styles depending on the texture that will best complement what's being sung at the moment. The level of thought given to the arrangements on even the shortest, most incidental tracks is astounding. One of the few bands I can think of that's this audibly meticulous is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1646-field-music/"" target=""_blank"">Field Music</a>, but their arrangements are never so colorfully bricolaged.</p>
<p>You can practically hear the kaleidoscope twist to make fresh patterns over the rocketing mid-section of ""Shirase"", as brightly hued instruments tumble into new positions with each passing moment. Though it makes left turns and constantly tweaks its formulas, <i>In Focus?</i> is admirably coherent and cohesive, with each little pile-up of ideas finding its place in the big pile-up of ideas that comprises the album. Tokumaru may not be able to stay in one place for long, but I'd still say the answer to the question of the title is yes.</p></div>"|17545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17545-in-focus/|7.6|Joe Tangari

Implicit in those comparisons is the assumption of O'Brien as a similarly young old-soul, a world-weary troubadour who lives to fight an eternal struggle: How does one convey the truth to the listener without sounding like a pedant, or worse, a fool? Success is typically achieved in a way that parallels the expansive demeanor of the music: starting with the knowledge that everyone is at the very least an expert on their own experience, and using your own truth to project outwards towards larger ideas. That's where O'Brien breaks rank, as Villagers take the opposite approach on the occasionally charming but mostly frustrating <i>{Awayland}</i>, an album which too often has big ideas and little proof of how he arrived at them.</p>
<p>The charms are there, though. O'Brien's voice is expressive and controlled, hitting every quiver and quaver just right and there's an astringent, citric quality that allows the smallest amount to pierce through. His tone rarely rises above a conversation, yet it always manages to forefront itself no matter how grand the arrangements get behind him. And they certainly are grand, or at least the sound that Mercury Prize nominations were made for, folk-rock earthy and glossy as a gemstone, but grounded in an earnest presentation that counters any temptation to call it ""slick."" He's claimed the influence of film composers such as Lalo Schifrin, which mostly manifests in strings pulling all sorts of dips and derring-do over tense, tight minor chord progressions. (My guess is O'Brien would be disappointed if the two-minute instrumental that bisects <i>{Awayland}</i> was described as anything other than ""cinematic."")</p>
<p><i>{Awayland}</i> demonstrates admirable range in more traditional formats: ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14619-the-waves/"" target=""_blank"">The Waves</a>"" is genuinely surprising, evolving from Morse code blips to a satisfying, frothy climax of distorted guitars, while ""Nothing Arrived"" situates a pat lyrical resolution (""I waited for something/ and something died/ so I waited for nothing/ and nothing arrived"") amidst easygoing pianos and acoustics like a wordy rendering of Travis ca. <i>12 Memories</i>. O'Brien does have a knack for melodies that hit squarely, but too much of <i>{Awayland}</i> prides itself in lyrical misdirection that renders his tunefulness an afterthought.</p>
<p>The misappropriated ambition is charming in an undergrad sort of way, and believe me, it will find an audience as long as college kids rubber-stamp indie-folk with poetic pretensions and the authenticity assumed from an Irish accent. O'Brien prefers giving his songs titles and choruses that are declarative (""Judgment Call"", ""Earthly Pleasure"", ""In a Newfoundland You Are Free"") and images that suggest permanence-- trees, waves, and guns as loaded metaphors. And they often come across as trenchant out of context, such as ""The Waves"", which claims ""one man's innocence is another's chance"" in a way that overstates its profundity. Likewise, any one of these fragments from the unconvincingly sinister ""Passing a Message"" could evolve towards an insightful conclusion, but O'Brien structures his stories like Jenga puzzles, a lattice of solid pieces that feel intentionally and ultimately fated to crumble once shared: ""I was carving my name out of a giant sequoia tree/ I was blind to its beauty now it's all I can see/ I learned how to listen to the folks on TV/ They are passing a message that means nothing to me.""</p>
<p>""The Bell"" is paradoxically the most overt demonstration of the strangely smug tone, an inverse ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"" that tries to find humor out of having nothing new to say. It is also a song about the futility of communication that is five minutes long and features lyrics like ""there is a passenger in every useless word/ can never be twisted or sold/ senator of my skin/ a body of discipline/ must be a million years old."" An extremely kind reading of it would be required to believe lines like the aforementioned are supposed to be self-deprecating, an intentionally purple exaggeration. Especially in light of a confession like ""there's a sleeping dog under this dialog/ obedient only to rhyme/ but if I could beckon her/ if I could find the words/ all they would be is lies,"" which comes off like more of a boast than apology. To its credit, <i>{Awayland}</i> rarely comes across as false, but O’Brien's affinity for cleverness over clarity ensures it rarely comes across in any real way.</p></div>"|17509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17509-awayland/|5.5|Ian Cohen

The outer borough rap scene is currently filled to the brim with larger-than-life personalities. So what room does that leave for a rapper like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30412-meyhem-lauren/"" target=""_blank"">Meyhem Lauren</a>, who, despite his linebacker-size and occasional wit, has yet to flesh out a recognizable persona in the midst of the flashy characters that surround him? It leaves him, in a word, forgettable, and in danger of joining the tradition of B and C list New York rappers who were blurrier shadows of their more talented counterparts. (Think of the way a gangster-lite, punchline rapper like Papoose consistently echoed the more charismatic Fabolous).</p>
<p>Lauren's recently released mixtape, <i>Mandatory Brunch Meetings</i>, doesn't do much to rectify the situation. It's a perfectly adequate listen, upgraded by beats by underground heavies like Mike Finito and Harry Fraud. And yet, even with 17 tracks to explore his options, Lauren still seems unable to decide, or unwilling to reveal, exactly who it is he wants to be.</p>
<p>That's not to say that the man they call Laurenovitch is without a personality. It's just that there's no real way to tell, over the course of his overstuffed mixtapes, which character is the true Lauren. Is he a fun-loving behemoth or a raw Queens goon? Is he sensible, an endorser of condoms and money made legally, or totally absurd, always out for a laugh, with a shottie cocked underneath the seat? There are lines on <i>Mandatory Brunch Meetings</i> that indicate all of the above, along with a host of other possible options.</p>
<p>On the Harry Fraud-produced standout, ""10 Dollar Lap Dances"", he's an aggro punchline rapper, a ""raw dealer fly like Blake Griffin over a four-wheeler"" who smashes women like ""negligent pedestrians."" ""Kelly Kapowski"", a should-be nostaligic ode to the <i>Saved by the Bell</i> pinup, finds him in romantic mode, describing the perfect woman in the most generic terms imaginable. And ""Burgundy Guess Jeans"" is all over the place-- on the chorus his ""gun sings,"" then he's all alliteration, ""provocative, producing pargraphs professionally,"" and then, suddenly reflective, wishing he ""could put time in a freezer…you only live once on this Earth, gotta explore it."" These consistent switches in subject matter leave you with nothing to latch onto, nothing to render the song memorable without the help of a catchy beat.</p>
<p>To add to his problems, Lauren never really bothers to switch up his flow or tone, consistently rapping in the aggressive half-shout which is the official rap equivalent of a monotone. You would think a song on which the rapper admires a pair of ""Beautiful Areolas"" might actually consist of some admiration, but even an admittedly hilarious line like ""her nipples look like silver dollar pancakes"" is delivered with a nonchalance that dulls what should be a standout bar.</p>
<p>The tape has two significant redeeming qualities-- consistently excellent gritty New York beats and outstanding guest features. Tommy Mas makes strings sing on ""Thousand Dollar Gym Shoes"" while Lauren delivers perhaps his best line of the tape, informing the listener that ""how to be a stupid nigga is the class we skipped."" But Bronson, who guests on the song, outdoes him without even trying, stringing together a couple of phrases that actually make sense consecutively. The end of his verse-- ""selling salmon so my son can eat, I'm trying to have a little taste of this life until I'm underneath""-- gives you a perfect idea of who Bronson is, even if you've never heard him spit a bar before.</p>
<p>The surprise guest of the tape is Gabbie Giftsz, a Brooklyn rapper with the accent of Nicki Minaj and the attitude of Ms. Roq. She's hugely entertaining on ""Silk and Leather Rap"", sing-songing her way through Freddie Krueger comparisons and launching into double-time for some charismatic brag raps. And her ad-hoc shit talking is probably the funniest moment on a tape flooded with ridiculous ad-libs.</p>
<p>Part of Lauren's appeal is his group mentality; this willingness to entertain guests like Bronson, Giftsz, Heems, Hologram, and other rappers on his projects can sometimes make his mixtapes seem more like block parties. This was true on last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17101-respect-the-fly-shit/"" target=""_blank""><i>Respect the Fly Shit</i></a>, on which a South by Southwest hotel room hosted a revolving door of capable rappers. That project flattered perceptions of Lauren by showing him to be a solid player in a vibrant, ascending musical scene. But when the group falls away, and Lauren is forced to make a track stand on its own, he becomes a cipher, refusing to belong to any kind of definable category. MC can stand for many things but it should never stand for miscellaneous-- Lauren's inability to pick an angle leaves him standing behind the brightest stars in his class.</p></div>"|17543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17543-mandatory-brunch-meetings/|5.2|Jonah Bromwich

His point was it's wrong to reject specific sounds-- in this case, the synth tones used in 1980s new age-- simply out of disdain for the genre they're associated with. In one sense, Lopatin's solo project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> is an ongoing battle against timbral fascism. He's tried to liberate synth sounds from their conventional trappings, placing them in less familiar contexts and coaxing you to hear them in new ways.</p>
<p>This laid-back battle began with Lopatin's first album, 2007's <i>Betrayed in the Octagon, </i>which he called ""a stoned space epic about one really bad day in the life of an astronaut."" His astronaut landed on a strange planet in 2009's <i>Russian Mind </i>and wrote the score to his own death in 2009's <i>Zones Without People</i>. But more interesting than that inscrutable tale was the way that, throughout this trilogy, Lopatin re-imagined synth music for the current era, injecting tension into something normally soft and cheesy. New age got a bad rep because it became too light to resonate, simplifying emotion instead of creating it. But even Lopatin's most beatific arpeggios and most soothing drones avoid sentimentality and easy-listening ambience. </p>
<p>That became clearer when New York noise label No Fun packaged those first three albums together-- along with tracks from smaller-run releases-- into the 2009 double CD <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13896-rifts/"">Rifts.</a></i> Listen to one track here or there and it can be tough to hear how lighter moments differ from the saccharine cloud of incidental mood music. But immerse yourself for long stretches, and <i>Rifts </i>sounds more like the hypnotic marathons of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Riley"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Terry Riley</a> than something playing in a store that sells candles and crystals. In that sense, the set<i> </i>was greater than the sum of its original albums. Absorbing all two and a half hours revealed commonalities between Lopatin's disparate constructions-- the kind that aren't apparent when you take OPN in small doses.</p>
<p>The immersion opportunities are even greater on Lopatin's new version of <i>Rifts</i>, issued on his own label <a href=""http://www.softwarelabel.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Software</a>. This lavish 5xLP/ 3xCD set includes six more tracks from previous releases, stretching it past the three-hour mark. Revisiting <i>Rifts </i>in this expanded (and reordered) form, I've found its stoic sadness even more impressive. Lopatin finds poignancy in wavering tones and rippling notes, conveying a sense of loss mixed with stiff-lipped acceptance. Even the set's one curveball-- an acoustic guitar song called ""I Know It's Taking Pictures From Another Plane (Inside Your Sun)""-- carries this tone, and sounds logical squeezed in between synth-scapes.</p>
<p>The rich moods of <i>Rifts</i> persist in the tracks Lopatin adds to this version. Take the hymn-like despondency in the trebly voices of ""Memory Vague."" Or the slow lurch of ""The Trouble With Being Born"", which sounds like a defeated army returning home, dejected enough to hang their heads but prideful enough to march in step. Such complex sentiments have marked Lopatin's work even as he's moved to the noisier drones of 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14326-returnal/"">Returnal</a></i> and the glitchier loops of 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16031-replica/"">Replica</a></i>.</p>
<p>So in retrospect, the path OPN has traveled makes sense. But when I first got <i>Betrayed in the Octagon </i>from <a href=""http://www.nofunproductions.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">No Fun</a><i> </i>in 2007, it was a bit of a shock. At that point the noise underground was still in an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7702-the-decade-in-noise/"">upswing,</a> and the harsher sounds of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1860-carlos-giffoni/"">Carlos Giffoni's</a> label (and <a href=""http://nofunfest.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">festival</a>) led the charge. There was diversity inside the No Fun umbrella, but nothing there sounded like <i>Betrayed in the Octagon</i>. It turns out that Giffoni and Lopatin were prescient, or at least observant, because soon many other underground artists began <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/03/entertainment/la-ca-new-age-20110703"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mining new age styles</a>.</p>
<p>That trend may be less in vogue a couple of years later, but it survives. Just in the past two months, excellent forays into new age-tinted synth have come from noise-leaning types such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17378-real-colors-of-the-physical-world/"">Joseph Raglani</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17485-persuasive-barrier/"">Robert Beatty</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14609-night-work/"">M. Geddes Gengras</a>. All of which makes <i>Rifts </i>look like an important touchstone, and it should. The way Lopatin discovered fresh ideas inside of a worn-out genre is an inspiring story for the present age.</p></div>"|17504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17504-rifts/|8.7|Marc Masters

Geddes Gengras</a> decamped to Jamaica to record with the legendary roots reggae group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13147-the-congos/"" target=""_blank"">the Congos</a>, whose Lee ""Scratch"" Perry-produced 1977 debut <i>Heart of the Congos</i> was one of the best albums to come out of Jamaica at a time when the island was producing an unprecedented amount of incredible music. It was an odd team-up, a bunch of older, very serious musicians collaborating across stylistic and cultural gaps with a couple of punkish young noise dudes, but the resulting record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16513-icon-give-thank/"" target=""_blank""><i>Icon Give Thank</i></a>, is a surprisingly organic synthesis of traditional reggae and envelope-pushing electronic experimentation. Now, what was originally presented as a one-off partnership, has spawned a live sequel.</p>
<p>Considering the depth of Stallones and Gengras' electronically manipulated production and the improvisatory feel to the recording, it's unlikely the coalition could have reproduced it accurately live, and this performance captured last June at the Village Underground in London at times only barely resembles their studio collaboration. Which is actually fine-- worrying about making an exact recreation of <i>Icon Give Thank</i> would be antithetical to its free-flowing energy, and would be kind of pointless to boot.</p>
<p>Placed side by side the two recordings make interesting companions. It seems fair to call <i>Icon Give Thank</i> the music of the Congos filtered through their new partners' forward-looking sensibilities. <i>Icon Give Life</i>, on the other hand, sounds more like the Congos hauling Gengras and Stallones back to the late 70s and throwing them and their gear into the anarchic electronics assemblage that comprised Perry's Black Ark Studios.</p>
<p>Backed by a group advertised as the Raw Power Band, the Congos, Stallones, and Gengras make a respectable reggae outfit. The grooves are thick and dense, and frequently display the assertive muscularity that characterized the ""rockers"" reggae that captivated Jamaican audiences around the time that the Congos first formed. The electronic flourishes that gave <i>Icon Give Thank</i> such a unique sound are placed further back in the live mix where they play the same role that Perry's delay-soaked embellishments did in the dubby <i>Heart of the Congos</i>.</p>
<p>Like <i>Icon Give Thank</i>, <i>Icon Give Life</i> wavers between its two musical poles before finding the proper balance. The songs where the spotlight is more directly on the Congos are perfectly enjoyable-- the fine, high voices of founders Roydel ""Ashanti"" Johnson and Cedric Myton haven't aged too noticeably, and the rest of the group and the Raw Power Band cohere nicely, with the proper amount of looseness to feel more like an actual working band than a nostalgic reproduction of one. The parts that are heavier on the noise dudes are less successful. On the record-closing rendition of ""Fisherman"", one of the Congos' signature cuts, Stallones and Gengras' attempts to add dubby texture overwhelms the song itself, and for a minute the project does exactly the worst thing an unlikely collaboration like this can do, which is make the listener question what these musicians are doing together in the first place.</p>
<p>But the two sides meld most seamlessly on ""Thanks and Praise"", one of the songs that the Congos, Stallones, and Gengras composed together. The instrumentation is sparse, with synthesized beeps and whirs bouncing off of hand drums and psychedelically modulated guitar arpeggios. Above this nearly abstract instrumental bed the Congos layer droning vocal parts that are closer to incantation than singing. The song doesn't build any sort of dynamic, it just sort of drifts along, but after two or three of its seven minutes the disparate elements cohere into a vaguely mystical whole, the group onstage transformed suddenly into an unlikely band of shamanic spirit guides. It's a gorgeous moment that you might wish would never end.</p></div>"|17526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17526-icon-give-life/|5.8|Miles Raymer

Then <i>Loyalty</i> splintered; a guest-heavy disc under that name is promised soon, while the sample-centric, soul-forward leavings-- which, for a while, Masta'd been calling <i>Soul &amp; Substance</i>-- finally landed in the December dead zone under the name <i>Selling My Soul</i>. We've gotten pretty used to the oil-and-water relationship between meddling A&amp;Rs with dollar signs in their eyes and rappers who know you can't make money selling records when you have no records to sell. But we're not talking Waka at Warner Brothers here; this is a Masta Killa record on Nature Sounds. You might think reshifting the focus back on the <i>Soul</i> side of things might make for a more taut, purposeful LP. But, like a small-scale version of all those hydra-headed, assembled-by-committee major label bloatfests, <i>Soul</i> arrives feeling picked over, toyed with, reassembled from spare parts.</p>
<p>With plenty of distended soul samples, slivers of dialogue, Killa's cautious, GZA-mentored flow, and a beat from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10020-inspectah-deck/"" target=""_blank"">Inspectah Deck</a> himself, <i>Selling My Soul</i> has all the hallmarks of a Wu-Tang LP. Killa's previous solo nods, 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5605-no-said-date/"" target=""_blank""><i>No Said Date</i></a> and 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9295-made-in-brooklyn/"" target=""_blank""><i>Made in Brooklyn</i></a>, stuck to pretty much the same script, to mostly gratifying effect; even as inter-Clan turmoil and shock at ODB's sudden death lead the mid-00s Clan into a period of creative stagnation, two headstrong Masta Killa LPs (and Ghostface's masterful <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3637-fishscale/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fishscale</i></a>) helped keep the Wu torch lit. <i>Date</i> and <i>Brooklyn</i> didn't risk much, but their narrow focus gave them a certain potency. Even with a runtime just shy of 40 minutes and at least half of its production given over to post-RZA pop-and-hiss, <i>Selling My Soul</i> lacks that same sense of cohesion. The LP feels less like the best bits of two would-be records than the warmed-over leftovers from either, a hastily assembled smorgasbord of tepid vinyl cracklers and <i>Loyalty</i> cast-offs. It has its moments, but they're fleeting, bogged down by its tepid pace and one too many oddball diversions.</p>
<p>Ever since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"" target=""_blank"">RZA</a> dropped the roll-call on <i>36 Chambers</i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"" target=""_blank""><i></i></a>' ""Clan in da Front"", the Wu-Tang have have been rap's greatest proponents of listmaking. I can't prove it, but <i>Selling My Soul</i> has to be just about the listiest Wu-Tang affiliated LP to date. Killa skips the now-obligatory run-down of the Wu-Tang ranks on ""Things Just Ain't the Same"", instead sneaking a full-group shout-out into a NY legend laundry list that includes Boogie Down and Run DMC. That's nothing next to ""Dirty Soul"", which finds Masta listing off his favorite soul singers by gender, then going through the groups, then breaking into a minute or two of Ol' Dirty Bastard's immortal ""Hippa to the Hoppa"". A mixtape? A live show? Fine places for these things. But Killa filling out his LiveJournal interests page for minutes on end takes up some serious real estate on an LP of this length, and whatever tone's been set by the dusty groove is lost somewhere around the eighth name he rattles off. ""Wise Words"" takes the homage thing even further, with Killa jumping on Zapp's ""Be Alright"", certainly best known as the sample behind 2Pac's ""Keep Ya Head Up""; he acknowledges the nod he's making to the classic without ever really explaining why he'd choose that particular (some might say untouchable) track. Hasty-seeming decisions like that are all over <i>Selling My Soul</i>, a strange thing indeed for a record some seven years in the making. Left coast legend Kurupt shows up halfway through for ""Cali Sun"", a tepid fifth-gen g-funk retread that might've been embarrassing had anybody put any semblance of effort into it. As it stands, it's just dull, two former greats going through the motions, too lazy to even figure out how to meet each other halfway.</p>
<p>And there's the real trouble with <i>Selling My Soul</i>: it's never bad, exactly, it just never seems to care enough to actually get all the way over to good. Masta Killa, after all, famously stayed up all night writing a verse strong enough to crowd Killah Priest out of ""Da Mystery of Chessboxin'"". But that Masta Killa does not appear on <i>Selling My Soul</i>. True, there are highlights: the slick, 9th Wonder-produced ""Food"", the slinky ""Soul &amp; Substance"". But that's mostly a function of the production; for the most part, Killa's flow has stayed squarely in the pocket, but <i>Soul</i> finds him mistaking lethargy for relaxation. Lyrics that probably looked great on paper are delivered in this sleepy fashion, causing otherwise purposeful lines to meander, sometimes float off into nowhere; over the years, his flow's grown so worn-in, so fluid, by the stanza's end, it's sometimes lost its shape.<i> Soul</i> displays Masta's natural way with a hook-- ""Food"" and ""Substance"" both hinge around choruses that seem to billow out of the man like smoke-- but too much of that nonchalance carries over to the verses, and what seemed effortless now just feels a little underdone. Despite repeated claims of attention to penmanship, of having something to say, that really only comes out in fits and spurts. ""All Natural"" is easily the best-realized thing here; over buttery vibraphone, Masta speaks on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgbyd5hJb2M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his vegetarianism</a> and other earthly concerns, imparting genuine passion and lived-in wisdom instead of just alluding to it. It's the one song on the spotty, often comatose <i>Selling My Soul</i> that sounds like it needed to be made. But it isn't nearly enough to make <i>Selling My Soul</i> the kind of album that demands to be heard.</p></div>"|17486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17486-selling-my-soul/|5.2|Paul Thompson

On last year's <i>Into the Woods</i>, there was more reliance on the twitchy beats he sometimes slides under the type of sombre, drone-oriented work he mapped out on his <a href=""http://kranky.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kranky</a> debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13737-144-pulsations-of-light/""><i>144 Pulsations of Light</i></a>. Generous cracks of warmth were opening up in Gray's music, moving him a half-step away from the chilly environs that had previously enveloped him. On <i>Opus 2</i>, which reunites him with Kranky, he's firmly back in the world of <i>Pulsations</i>, creating a set of tracks that feel like a freezing wind has blown over them. Time and place might be a factor. The album was recorded over a Pacific Northwest winter, during a period when he was working night shifts providing technical support for hospital operating rooms. The feeling of being removed from reality burns through the album, as you'd expect from music recorded under such circumstances. At times it feels cut off from humanity altogether, with Gray locked into a deeply contemplative, utterly inward-looking journey.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Opus 2</i> may be a solitary work, but it does have some distant companions, mostly from a small band of fellow solo musicians. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5821-wolfgang-voigt/"">Wolfgang Voigt</a> under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1686-gas/"">Gas</a> alias have all inhabited similarly desolate places. It's all rolling clouds, amorphous surfaces, and a strong sense of pining that underpins every move. Those moves are slow, sometimes beautiful, especially when Gray stretches subtle countermelodies under his purposefully fuzzy framework. The lighter synth tones on ""Monarch"" make it sound like a cut from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"">the Knife</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4590-silent-shout/""><i>Silent Shout</i></a> that has been slowed down to a languid crawl. It's by far the warmest track on <i>Opus 2</i>, but still one that feels like Gray had to forsake everything around him in order to extract its refined grace. There's nothing else here that returns to a similar point, again suggesting that he hasn't quite got around to coloring in the bigger picture for Ethernet. Leaving the project in aesthetic flux is fine, too, but it does break a gloomy spell that would likely elevate this work if it was cast over a full album in its entirety.</p>
<p>Finding material to lose yourself in is key here-- Gray even describes the music as ""improvised sonic meditations,"" which are designed as part of his ""trancework (or self-hypnosis) practice."" When it works, such as on the contemplative <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14681-correction/"">""Correction""</a>, it's like exploring a series of caves that reveal many more layers and markings than you ever expected. Gray has a knack for depth, for burying barely perceptible material in his work that only transpires after multiple plays and close-up listening. The hiss that blankets ""Dog Star"" detracts from some of those moments on initial plays, sometimes even threatening to overwhelm the track altogether. That's where <i>Opus 2</i> disconnects from more placid pieces in this field. There's a brittle edge to it, sidling toward unease at times. You can blank out the world to ""Dog Star"", but it doesn't deposit you in a place of rest. Instead, there's a creeping sense of anxiety to it, a feeling of troubled thoughts seeping into the stillness.</p>
<p>There's plenty of similar sentiment spread throughout this record, and acres of room in which to explore it; none of the six tracks dip below the seven-minute mark. But at this point there should be a better idea of the overall direction Gray wants to take Ethernet in. At times, the primitive, electronic sound of ""Dodecahedron"" attempts to emulate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/223-selected-ambient-works-85-92/"">Selected Ambient Works 85-92</a>,</i> but it's too vast a leap from the swirling darkness that gathers around a track like ""Correction"". Of course, the sense of remote isolation this album feeds off doesn't just generate one mood, one train of thought, one place to dwell in. But there needs to be a firming up of the bridges being built-- if not an overall Ethernet ""sound"" then at least a sense of connections being hammered out to bind Gray's disparate inclinations. Fortunately, <i>Opus 2</i> ends on a high. The ever-repeating figures of ""Pleroma"" are where the album peaks, in a glassy elegy that sweeps away everything before it with its infinite weight and heightened ambition, opening up a trail that Gray would be wise to further scrutinize.</p></div>"|17541.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17541-opus-2/|6.0|Nick Neyland

""I heard all these ideas, loops, samples, and shit that I never really got to finish,"" he told <a href=""http://www.junodownload.com/plus/2012/08/20/dj-nature-necessary-ruffness/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Juno</a> last summer, ""so I decided to bang out a couple of those and see what I came up with."" Unsurprisingly, what he came up with was an extension of what he'd done before: deep, gritty, midtempo music that walks the line between disco and house. In <a href=""http://testpressing.org/2012/10/20-questions-016-milo-johnson-dj-nature/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">more recent interviews</a>, Johnson has described himself as the epitome of a hermit, called his favorite place outside of a club ""home,"" and, in true dad fashion, tells his college age sons-- who are also DJs-- to ""turn that shit down."" His change in stage name (from Nature Boy to <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30972-dj-nature/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Nature</a>) is, in his words, an admission that ""it's a bit tough calling yourself Nature Boy when you're 50.""</p>
<p>Not that Johnson's music sounds particularly old, or particularly new for that matter. The magic of <i>Return of the Savage </i>is how confidently it keys into dance music's core values: A 4/4 kick ornamented with hand-drum syncopations, open-ended track structures, and a foreground borrowed from funk, jazz, and 1960s soul. Some keyboards and horns are played live, some are sampled, but the samples slide off the beat in the way a live player might-- a comforting looseness Johnson chalks up to his need to get ideas recorded as quickly as possible before forgetting them. The key, though, is in the stamp of his production, which has a dusty, tactile quality, so ""live""-sounding to 2013 ears that you know it's the product of processing. It's an approach he traces back not only to his early days working with budget recording gear, but to eureka moments hearing early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan/"" target=""_blank"">Wu-Tang Clan</a>, a turning point in modern music when the sound of something new suddenly became a hyperreal collage of something old.</p>
<p>None of the tracks here have any kind of dramatic rise and fall, and all of them run at roughly the same tempo, which can make <i>Savages</i> feel like a long, dreamy articulation of a single thought, punctuated by commas and ellipses, trailing off into tangents that subtly refocus on the original idea. (See: ""Sexual Tension Scene 1"", which is followed by ""Sexual Tension Scene 2""; how the opening statement of purpose, ""Return of the Savage"", is reprised later on, or the ways sampled vocalists drift in and out of the mix like resplendent ghosts.) Like most of the releases on <a href=""http://www.golfchannelrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Golf Channel Recordings</a>, <i>Savages </i>feels both high-quality and low-stakes, classy and effortless, the sound of an artist proving themselves in part by making music like they have nothing to prove-- something someone who waited 20 years to put out his debut full-length should know all about.</p></div>"|17542.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17542-return-of-the-savage/|7.4|Mike Powell

In Richmond, Va., were Labradford, whose slow-moving and cinematic pieces showed how much could be wrung from simplicity and repetition. Up in Dearborn, Mich., Windy Weber and Carl Hultgren were making sensual drone music inspired both by the endless held tones of Lamonte Young and the textural romanticism of 4AD. And down in East Austin, Tex., there were Adam Wiltzie and Brian McBride, who made druggy and internally-focused drone music as Stars of the Lid.  </p>
<p>Stars of the Lid's 1995 debut was called <i>Music for Nitrous Oxide</i> and it had a track called ""Tape Hiss Makes Me Happy""; those two phrases offer a serviceable definition of what SOTL's early music was all about. Working at home and recording on their Yamaha MT-120 and Tascam Portastudio 424, Wiltzie and McBride were patiently mapping a new terrain for experimental music. Along with groups like the previously mentioned Windy &amp; Carl in the United States and UK groups like Flying Saucer Attack and Amp, they were taking the tools of D.I.Y. culture (recording at home, getting the word out through print zines, releasing music on smaller, specialized labels, demonstrating a fondness for cheap and easy cassettes) and using them to make abstract music for deeply immersive listening. <i>Music For Nitrous Oxide</i> mixed metallic drones and feedback with the sounds of strange voices; the effect was something like tuning into two radio stations at once, hearing strange disembodied phrases mixed with weird music that floated across the plains. For their third album, 1997's <i>The Ballasted Orchestra</i>, which has been out of print for some time and has now been reissued on vinyl by Kranky, they did away with the voices and followed their drones to a place where words have no meaning. </p>
<p><i>The Ballasted Orchestra</i> is four sides of shifting guitar-based drone, with textures that range from thick and menacing to thin and ethereal. For those more familiar with SOTL's work from the last decade (ambient music classics <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10064-and-their-refinement-of-the-decline/"" target=""_blank""><i>And Their Refinement of the Decline</i></a> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7476-the-tired-sounds-of/"" target=""_blank"">The Tired Sounds of..</a>.</i>) what's most striking about <i>Ballasted</i> is how raw and ragged it sounds, in the best possible way. As the the SOTL project matured, the music grew more pristine, incorporating strings and horns and drawing inspiration from carefully composed music by artists like Arvo Part. In 1997, when these tracks were recorded, Wiltzie and McBride were firmly committed to seeing how much feeling they could wring from guitars and effects pedals. </p>
<p>Turns out it was quite a lot. Some psychedelic drone music seems like it's designed to soundtrack a trip through the cosmos; Stars of the Lid invites you to close your eyes and explore your own mind. And the range of sensations and moods is surprisingly wide. The disorienting ""Sun Drugs"" mixes thin tendrils of wavering drone with trebly guitar notes that feel random like wind chimes. ""Taphead"" is closer to the airy drift of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois' Apollo while ""Fucked Up (3:57 AM)"" is tensely cinematic, with overlapping chords that are finally interrupted with a cavernous bass that sounds like a tuba blast echoing through an empty gym.</p>
<p>But the highlight and centerpiece is the side-long ""Music for Twin Peaks Episode #30"", which is split into two parts. David Lynch's television series ended its two-season run with episode #29, so the clever title (and Stars of the Lid have always had good ones) affirms that they're using their imaginations to soundtrack a fictional world. And while the work of frequent Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti's work has been an inspiration to Wiltzie and McBride (see ""Mullholland"" on <i>The Tired Sounds of</i>), at this point the connection was more thematic than sonic. If anything, the piece is more likely to bring to mind the industrial soundscaping of Lynch's sound design partner Alan Splet. But SOTL's speculative soundtrack is absolutely masterful, a drawn-out throb of drone that feels vividly alive. At high volume it taps into the oceanic quality of shoegaze, dissolving boundaries between the listener and the listened-to. </p>
<p>The ""Twin Peaks"" nod helps explain why Stars of the Lid still feel so relevant and why this music, while deeply connected to the wide-open world of 90s tape-based psychedelia, still feels so current. We'll never stop soundtracking our space and creating virtual worlds. It might happen with a YouTube or an installation but in 1997 there were 4-track tapes recorded by friends in dark rooms that somehow found their way to other people who understood the transmission. </p></div>"|17508.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17508-the-ballasted-orchestra/|8.5|Mark Richardson

So it's with the utmost respect to Mr. Knuckles that I recommend that if and when you check out this 2xCD DJ mix he produced for the clasically-minded UK label Nocturnal Groove you skip the entire first half hour of the first disc.</p>
<p>That is, unless your tastes in house music run towards overly polished, unaggressive beats that dip into into smooth jazz and contemporary gospel, which is where a lot of this stretch of tracks-- many of them classic cuts given recent reworkings by Knuckles under his Director's Cut alias-- ends up. Some people do like this kind of thing, including house music fans who've stuck with the genre well into middle age, the people responsible for compiling background music for retail outlets, and Germans.</p>
<p>In a way the irritatingly supersmooth portion of the mix, so devoid of any kind of rough edge to snag a listener's attention, is a logical extension of Knuckles' work going back to his earliest days. Even during house music's nascent years he strove to present a smoother, cleaner sonic experience than his contemporaries. While Ron Hardy, one of the other couple of DJs who contributed to house's genesis, used the most advanced technologies of the time-- reel-to-reel tape decks, turntables with pitch controls-- to explore the anarchic possibilities of a new, beat-driven dance music descended from disco, Knuckles used them to isolate and expand disco's most satiny moments into epically glitzy dancefloor fantasias.</p>
<p>That isn't to say they were any less valid than Hardy's sets (or Larry Levan's, or Chip E.'s, or anyone else's at the time), or that they are any less bumping. Behind all the silkiness is a DJ who wants to jack bodies with the talents to make that happen, and after the overly genteel warm-up, that DJ takes over the mix for two more hours that more than make up for it.</p>
<p>Looking at the lineup of artists on <i>Beyond the Tone Arm</i> you'll see a lot of names from vintage Frankie Knuckles sets that you can find online: Candi Staton, Jamie Principle, Yoko Ono, Lil Louis. The mix is a self-conscious attempt at replicating the type of experience he offered crowds at the Warehouse and the Power Plant in the 80s, the sets that helped establish him as one of the world’s first superstar DJs. And it does a really good job of it.</p>
<p>Listening to the mix, it's easy to see how Knuckles managed to become famous for playing records at nightclubs at a time when that was unheard of. He likes beats that stick close to a discofied four-on-the-floor, but he also likes little rhythmic tics that subliminally nag at the listener in a way you can't help but move to, even if you're just listening to it as background music while web browsing. Take that sturdy rhythmic backbone and add a refined taste for theatrically ecstatic soul-diva vocals and you start to see what it was about Knuckles' approach that allowed him to carve out a place in the mainstream for house music, work that he continued throughout the 90s as the remixer of choice for A-list pop stars like Michael and Janet Jackson.</p>
<p>Those same qualities are being rediscovered by a new wave of dance musicians who have been raiding the 80s and 90s for inspiration now that their extended period of being considered cheesy has expired. Neo-club producers like Brenmar and the current crop of New York disco revival groups have made Knuckles a touchstone in the contemporary dance scene once again, even as EDM acts related (albeit distantly) to Knuckles are filling arenas. <i>Beyond the Tone Arm</i> doesn’t touch on any material from these newer acts, which could be considered a missed opportunity-- I'd be curious to see what he would do with some current sounds, and I'm disappointed that he didn't see fit to include his near-perfect remix of Hercules &amp; Love Affair's ""Blind"". But that's not really the point of this mix. It's one artist's summation of the music he and some like-minded individuals used to alter the course of pop music, and proof that he still knows how to put it together into something suitable to rattling buildings-- not so much resting on his laurels but pulling them out, passing them around, and showing off how well they still fit.</p></div>"|17455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17455-beyond-the-tone-arm/|6.2|Miles Raymer

The New York City-based duo perform at coffeehouse volume, but their core inspiration has always owed more to Tom Verlaine than Alan Lomax. Aaron Mullan and Dave Mies rarely strum a chord. Instead, they form their songs from the back-and-forth dialogue between crisp and clean riffs on open-tuned electric guitars. There's a hint of old-school country music-- primarily in the sparse arrangements and solemn sentiments of their lyrics-- but they've bleached out any audible trace of twang.</p>
<p>Their third album, <i>Out of It and Into It</i>, arrived last March in the UK via ATP recordings, but is only now seeing a US release, possibly timed to the their upcoming tour supporting Neutral Milk Hotel-guru, Jeff Mangum.</p>
<p>Percussion played only a modest roll in Tall Firs debut record, but for 2008's <i>Too Old to Die Young</i>, they brought on drummer Ryan Sawyer to balance out their ethereal plucking with some earthly pummel. The result was a minor detour toward the avant-roots rock sounds of latter day Sonic Youth, for whom Mullan had long worked as a studio and live sound engineer. They pulled it off better than most, though. The steady pulse helped to anchor the songs, giving the guitarists free reign to noodle between verses.</p>
<p>On <i>Out of It and Into It,</i> Tall Firs are once again a duo and they've dialed the volume back accordingly, delivering a quieter, more reflective set. They still have the riffs, but without the snap of a snare drum to keep things in line, the chiming guitars become repetitive and amorphous.</p>
<p>If there's one area that Tall Firs excel as songwriters, it's in conjuring up nostalgia for stoner days gone by. ""We were acid-crazed teenage tweak-outs, those booze fueled days of pills and freak-outs,"" sang Mullan, in the opening verse of <i>Too Ol</i><i>d</i>'s leadoff track, conscious that one of the best things about the good old days was that they were over. ""Hairdo"", the tune that owed the most to Mullan's then employers, was a rose-colored backward glance at hipster romance.</p>
<p>They have another winner along the same lines here with ""Crooked Smiles"", a call to getting ugly. ""Let's turn this mother out/ let's bring the ship about,"" sings Mullan. ""Let's blow it all tonight/ crooked smiles all right."" Of the two singers, Mullan is the more naturally tuneful, but on <i>Out of It</i>, Mies gets the majority of the mic time. During the record's most subdued moments, his limited range and gravely delivery sometimes spoil the mood.</p>
<p>Tall Firs are skilled interpreters, though, and they have consistently picked good covers, most of them drawn from the darker corners of  90s indie rock. The band's debut found them pulling off a spooky take of D.C. witch-rock trio Quix*o*tic's ""The Breeze"". Their <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/tallfirs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soundcloud page</a> is dotted with stark and solemn re-do's of indie-rock gone by-- including Hot Snakes' ""This Mystic Decade"" and Scrawl's ""Prize"".</p>
<p>Here, Mies takes on ""I Couldn't Say it to Your Face"", from Arthur Russell's early works compilation, <i>Love is Overtaking Me</i>. They trade out the R&amp;B feel of the original for a stark arrangement that sounds like it could have come out of a living room jam session between Texas strummers Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark. Mies strains, but he hits the notes and touches on some of the weirdo innocence that made the original so affecting. But put one against another, Russell's version wins out. It had the stronger pulse.</p></div>"|17418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17418-out-of-it-and-into-it/|6.4|Aaron Leitko

Fears can breed unmolested by the real world, and help is always just outside of screaming range. John Orth sets <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1969-holopaw/"">Holopaw</a>'s fourth album at an all-boys prep school, and while it's not technically a scary story, these songs explore the horrors of errant desires, precarious friendships, severed alliances, and social ostracization. It's perhaps the most conceptually ambitious enterprise Holopaw has undertaken to date, and that includes Orth’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8332-sharpen-your-teeth/"">Ugly Casanova</a> side project with Isaac Brock.</p>
<p>As a songwriter, Orth pens lyrics that only hint at plot developments: A sick child misses out on games by the lake, two boys fuck until the school bell sounds, a group make an awkward trek to a nightclub. He's more concerned with evocative details, which lend <i>Academy Songs</i> an intense sensuality that threatens to overwhelm the songs. ""Shoulders pressed into the coils of your bed/ all taut resistance, no giving in,"" Orth sings on ""Diamonds"". ""But at the ringing of the bell/ your body goes slack at the count of, 'one two three'…/ the heat of you, the crush of me."" Passages like that compensate for some of the less assured metaphors and conceits: the repetition of ""virgin snow"" and ""lights of the discotheque"" are freighted with more import than their threadbare phrases can carry. </p>
<p>This prep school proves a compelling milieu that ultimately suits Orth's lyrical approach quite well but unfortunately doesn't jibe with Holopaw's strengths. <i>Academy Songs</i> lacks the animating weirdness of the band's best albums, especially 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13714-oh-glory-oh-wilderness/""><i>Oh, Glory. Oh, Wilderness</i></a>. They've always sounded best when they've sounded fearlessly omnivorous, when they've bent existing styles and traditions-- country, punk, film scores, and so on-- to meet their idiosyncratic concerns. Here they've whittled their sound to a particular kind of gossamer indie rock that's rich in montage-ready ambience but poor in structure, flourish, and personality. The songs drift and wander, aiming for mystery but too often miring in preciousness, especially on ""Bedfellows Farewell"".</p>
<p>The performances are tight and capable, suggesting a band that is capable of much more. Drummer Ryan Quinney may be the <i>Academy</i> MVP, playing with a constant sense of purpose and invention on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14380-golden-sparklers/"">""Golden Sparklers""</a> and ""Infidels"". As <i>Academy Songs</i> marches on, however, he's given less and less to do, which means the second half flutters unceremoniously to a close. There's no big reveal, no twist, no run through the woods-- no sense of epiphany or conclusion. Instead, the album simply flickers out like a candle, with the faint promise of another visit to this setting. </p></div>"|17500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17500-academy-songs-volume-i/|5.8|Stephen M.

From Hans Christian Andersen to the Brothers Grimm, the fantastical has always intermingled in equal measure with the terrifying, in ways often more grisly and frank than we remember outside of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carter"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Angela Carter</a> adaptations. As the former mouthpiece for the now defunct <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/122-arab-strap/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Arab Strap</a>, Aidan Moffat has never been stranger to this sort of balance of ugliness and beauty. As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2595-l-pierre/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">L. Pierre</a> (formerly Lucky Pierre), the moniker used for his now decade-long running found-sound project, he's leaned much harder on the latter.</p>
<p>With <i>The Island Come True</i>, his fourth L. Pierre release and the first since 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9903-dip/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dip</i></a>, Moffat has found a spiritual kinship with fellow Scot and author J.M. Barrie, most famous for his Peter Pan stories. The album takes it's name from <a href=""http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/86/peter-pan/1543/chapter-5-the-island-come-true/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a chapter from</a> <i>Peter &amp; Wendy</i>, and it too is grimmer than you probably remember: For all the adventure and wonder crammed into its few thousand words, the segment is littered with sorrow, longing and blood. Using crackling piano suites, field recordings, found loops and swelling bits of dusty classical pieces, Moffat has crafted something similarly antique and unexpectedly dark, a moving if not fractured album that feels congruent with Barrie's mix of the fantastic and the fearful.</p>
<p>On previous L. Pierre recordings, Moffat was keen to toy around with his collages, adding his own electronic flourishes to help round things out. But on <i>The Island Come True</i> (as hinted at on <i>Dip</i>), he's done away with any sort of tinkering, leaving his combinations of these existing pieces to speak for themselves. ""There's something beautiful in hearing the grit and hiss of old recordings,"" Moffat has said of the album, and it's not hard to see the commonalities shared with James Kirby's work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29716-the-caretaker/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">The Caretaker</a>. Though not as affecting but certainly more varied and melodramatic, Moffat has made his best album as L. Pierre with <i>The Island Come True</i>, a snapshot of his own little slice of Neverland.</p>
<p>Moffat is clearly still interested in telling stories, but it's not always so easy to follow his train of thought. Whereas something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15518-an-empty-bliss-beyond-this-world/"" target=""_blank""><i>An Empty Bliss Beyond This World</i></a> is distinct and singular in its narrative, <i>The Island Come True</i> works like a collection of shorts, many of which manage to strike rich emotional chords. At one moment, you're floating a gondola down the Styx as a hair-raising concertina plays on in the background (""Harmonic Avenger""), and the very next you're being treated to a minute and a half of rusty, tumbling drums (""Drums""). Children mutter phonetic nonsense in lullaby (""Dumbum""), old recordings of relaxation techniques are layered hypnotically (""Tulpa""), seagulls shriek in the distance (""Kab 1340""). What's left is more of a jigsaw puzzle that is occasionally stunted due to a lack of fluidity, but the pervading mood is unmistakable: Like a forlorn soundtrack to a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quay_Brothers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Quay Brothers</a> film, the music paints strange, tiny pictures where you can see the vintage machinations at work.</p>
<p>Moffat is most consistent in his creations when the focus is centered around string and piano driven pieces. While something like ""Sad Laugh"" might be the best representation of his intent here (it's difficult to discern whether the sounds you're hearing are children laughing or crying), the most unhurried pieces are the ones that truly stick. With the piercing crescendos of ""The Grief That Does Not Speak"" or the lonely slow waltz of the album's finest piece ""Exits"", Moffat is able to excavate more sorrow and loveliness than his technique would suggest. Coupled with the creaking, popping physicality of the music-- a sensory experience akin to cracking a leathery old book-- <i>The Island Come True</i> reacts like a lost shadow being reunited with his owner.</p></div>"|17520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17520-the-island-come-true/|7.1|Zach Kelly

I remember driving from New Brunswick, N.J., to Philadelphia to bring my girlfriend a promo cassette copy of <i>Dear You</i>, the group's 1995 post-Green Day major label debut. It had arrived a day earlier at the record store where I worked, and I thought she'd want to hear it. I got out of the van, showed it to her; she tossed it on the ground, smashed it under her foot. Around that same time, a guy I knew from local basement shows, came into the record store, pointed to the tattoo of the Jawbreaker logo on his arm, and shook his head. He had tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>This was a band the underground didn't want to lose, at a time when commerce wasn't so closely intertwined with everyday listening experiences. Formed while they were students at NYU, the trio of vocalist/guitarist Blake Schwarzenbach, bassist Chris Bauermeister, and drummer Adam Pfahler relocated to Los Angeles and released their debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14079-unfun/"" target=""_blank""><i>Unfun</i></a>, in 1990 (it was reissued by Blackball in 2010). <i>Unfun</i> was a good (<i>very fun</i>) record, a solid dose of early 90s emotional, literate punk that established the raw-voiced Schwarzenbach as an underground hero. The band went on the so-called ""Fuck 90"" tour with Econochrist that summer and broke up, but managed to get back together, relocate to San Francisco, and record 1992's <i>Bivouac</i>.</p>
<p>The record found them experimenting, and pushing into deeper, angrier, heavier (and headier) waters. People cite 1994's Steve Albini-helmed 2<i>4 Hour Revenge Therapy</i>, which showed up after they played some shows in 1993 with Nirvana, as the group's pre-major label masterpiece. But <i>Bivouac</i> has always held a special place for me. It's their darkest collection, a sprawling, shaggy-dog set that found them transitioning from the cleaner, calmer <i>Unfun</i> to something grittier, wilder, and smarter. <i>Bivouac</i> was a ragged call to arms, <i>24 Hour Revenge Therapy</i> an ambitious offering within that newer space they'd created.</p>
<p><i>Bivouac</i> also includes one of their most beloved songs, ""Chesterfield King"", a poppy anthem a lot of people saw themselves in. It was a perfect punk vignette. In just about four minutes Schwarzenbach sets a scene (""We stood in your room and laughed out loud/ Suddenly the laughter died and we were caught in an eye to eye/ We sat on the floor and did we sit close"") as vivid as good fiction. One of his gifts was finding a way to present specific, personal details (""Held your hand and watched TV and traced the little lines along your palms"") and make them feel universal. So, here, when the protagonist cuts out to catch his breath and ends up sharing smokes and thoughts with a toothless woman in a 7-11 parking lot, you sort of remember this happening to you, too.</p>
<p>But it's not all love and lovesickness. From opener ""Shield Your Eyes"" (""There was a sun once/ It lit the whole damn sky/ It kept everything alive"") onward this is an apocalyptic record filled with bigger kinds of searches, depression, and dirt. You get that soul sickness in ""P.S. New York Is Burning"", ""Parabola""'s ""I saw myself in someone else and hated them,"" and ""Like a Secret""'s request: ""Don't talk me down from here/ Let me fly this kite without a string."" It shows up clearest, and more impressively, in the 10-minute closing title track's search for meaning: ""I'm lonely/ I'm an only/ I learned to put on airs/ I needed them to breathe/ Today I wake up."" Here, Schwarzenbach sets an earth clawing scene (""I dug my fingers in the earth/ I drew pictures of my pain/ They were so pretty"") punctuated by feedback, noise, and the singer's howling of the album title, a shout that hurts and brings down the shelter he's place around himself. It's a call for help, though one that doesn't need to be answered. You get the sense that it's the act itself that mattered most.</p>
<p><i>Biouvac</i>'s 20th Anniversary CD reissue, remastered by John Golden from the original tapes, includes songs from the original studio sessions: ""Ache"", which showd up on <i>24 Hour Revenge Therapy</i>, and ""Peel It the Fuck Down"", which appeared on the 2002 compilation <i>Etc</i>. Like the original 1992 CD, this version includes the four-songs that appeared on the 1992 Chesterfield King 12"": ""Tour Song"", ""Face Down"", ""You Don't Know"", and ""Pack It Up"". For those who followed the band at the time, those tracks have always felt as much a part of the tracklisting as the 9-song vinyl version. (Fittingly, Blackball has also reissued the 9-song <i>Bivouac</i> and <i>Chesterfield King</i> 12"" on vinyl for the first time in years.)</p>
<p>One of those <i>Chesterfield King</i> tracks, ""Tour Song"", ends with the line: ""<span class=""st"">Every little thing must go wrong."" But, the truth is, despite things not working out exactly as planned, everything did not go wrong.</span> People were angry when Schwarzenbach had painful polyps removed from his vocal chords and were ready to riot when, later, he cleaned up his vocal sound for <i>Dear You</i>. That record didn't sell well enough according to DGC standards, Jawbreaker never became the next Nirvana or Green Day, and in 1996 the group called it quits. But, in retrospect, <i>Dear You</i> was the right record for the band to make. (It's a <i>great</i> album, just not the one you wanted to hear when you were 21 and navigating a close-knit underground that hadn't dealt with this sort of thing firsthand.)

Strip the bells out of ""Lay in a Shimmer"" from the high-benchmark Pantha release <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13947-black-noise/""><i>Black Noise</i></a> and it simultaneously loses its twinkly elegance and errs a little too close to humdrum genre fare. Back in 2011 Weber appeared at the Øya Festival in Oslo where he took his obsession up a notch by collaborating with a collection of musicians on a series of bell-oriented tracks under the name Pantha du Prince and the Bell Laboratory. The name neatly tied into Weber's fascination with the instrument and electronic music's past; the original Bell Laboratories were where <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Mathews"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Max Mathews</a> developed one of the first computer programs to play music back in the 1950s. At Øya the group played a piece titled <i>Elements of Light</i>, the name given to this studio recording of their efforts. There's a lightness to it that belies the literal heaviness at the center of the album-- an instrument named the bell carillon, made up of 50 bronze bells, bearing a combined weight of three tonnes.</p>
<p>This isn't such a great departure for Weber, instead coming across as the logical extension of an idea he's been chasing for a while. There are elements of classic minimalism worked in, as well as a healthy dose of the all-surface moves that were typical of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a>'s transitionary work on the <i>TNT</i> album. On that record it felt like Tortoise were bridging between the airless electronics they leaned on during <i>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</i> and a space where you could sense them loosening up a little more. It's a feeling this album also taps into. The playing is incredibly tight, but there's a sense of adventure to the whole undertaking, with all the players locked into a common goal. It's an instrumental album with a tinge of narrative, particularly when they venture into mazy 10-minute-plus pieces like ""Particle"" and ""Spectral Split"". Ventures like this often end up feeling like a display of chops, a demonstration of proficiency, an exercise in technical prowess. <i>Elements of Light</i> is mostly the opposite; it feels like those involved were as invested in the transformative power of the music as they were in flexing their not inconsiderable talents.</p>
<p>""Particle"" is a particularly impressive example of how versatile the bell can be as an instrument, especially when it juxtaposes ominous, church-like clangs with lighter tones that skip and twist across its surface. It's positively giddy at times, never quite ending up where you expect, bringing in familiar beats and swells of bass that anchor it in Weber's world, then constantly pulling rugs out from underneath the listener. To give away too much would spoil the surprises that are crucial to making this album work, but a small glimpse of its magic can be found in the turn into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom Waits</a>-style pots-and-pans percussion that is unexpectedly teased out during a section of ""Particle"". Moments like that, rendered here as a brief snatch of creative flash, but surely the basis for an entire track in lesser hands, are the points where this album really excels. Occasionally it meanders into cyclical drifting, particularly in shorter tracks like ""Photon"", where the ideas run a little dry. But even that just about works as a contemplative prelude to ""Spectral Split"", serving as a necessary foot-off-the-gas moment before something meatier.</p>
<p>It's in ""Spectral Split"" that <i>Elements of Light</i> flashes through all its tones, from washed out ambience to a momentum borrowed lightly from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a>'s <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i>, to the interlinking of classical and electronic textures that Weber so clearly obsesses over. It also demonstrates his astute understanding of how important anticipation is in dance music, with almost half the 17-minute runtime devoted to a slow build that explodes into color when all its spaghetti-like parts are interwoven. That sense of release surfaces sporadically throughout the album and is fundamental to making it work, but it's always delivered with a great degree of control and patience. Sometimes a stiffness emerges in the playing and it feels too mechanical, like a computer trying to figure out the meaning of joy, but even those little moments tie in perfectly with the historic wink in the name of the Bell Laboratory. It's possible that their collected devotion to precision would loosen up more in a live setting, of which more plans are <a href=""http://www.roughtraderecords.com/panthaduprince/4704/pantha-du-prince-the-bell-laboratory-announce-elements-of-light-album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">afoot</a>. Here, there's a sense of picking at a strand of inspiration and seeing how it flows toward a form of endgame, albeit one that still prickles with possibility.</p></div>"|17511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17511-elements-of-light/|7.0|Nick Neyland

He founded ""electronically made music"" label <a href=""http://moodgadget.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moodgadget</a>, performs A&amp;R for <a href=""http://www.ghostly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghostly International</a>, curates the music selection on graphic artist Scott Hansen's (a.k.a. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28474-tycho/"" target=""_blank"">Tycho</a>) art and lifestyle blog <a href=""http://blog.iso50.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ISO50</a>, and records and performs as a DJ and musician under his own name and several others. As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30841-heathered-pearls/"" target=""_blank"">Heathered Pearls</a>, the Polish-born musician recently released his full-length debut <i>Loyal</i>, a low level (his preferred term for ""ambient"", which he associates with the decidedly less hip-sounding ""pure mood"") album designed <a href=""http://ghostly.com/releases/loyal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""as a mental break from my personal anxieties.""</a> And <i>Loyal </i>is a hypnotic record, siphoning in and out of repeated, textured loops that soothingly chafe against each other like fingers performing a head massage.</p>
<p>It's surprising, then, that Alexander practically mandates hooks in the music of the artists he signs to Moodgadget. When discussing the label's recent compilation <i>Expanse at Low Levels</i> with <a href=""http://www.percussionlab.com/sets/percussion_lab_radio/an_interview_with_jakub_alexander"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Percussion Lab</a>, he gave some advice to aspiring electronic artists: ""If you got a hook and you can write a song and keep it at two-and-a-half minutes long, and I want to hear it over and over, that's going to make me want to email you back."" Like most ambient or low-level music-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Hecker</a>'s touchstone <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15124-ravedeath-1972/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ravedeath, 1972</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9002-laurie-spiegel/"" target=""_blank"">Laurie Spiegel's machine music</a>, and electronic pioneers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25173-otto-luening/"" target=""_blank"">Otto Luening</a>-- <i>Loyal </i>is devoid of those hooks in the traditional sense, the tension and release that evokes the visceral reaction of wanting to hear something again and again. </p>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<div>Listening to ""Ringing Temple"", the album's echoing, urgently polyrhythmic centerpiece that probably draws the most from Alexander's other work as a DJ alongside slow-motion disco outfit Worst Friends and Matthew Dear, there seemed nothing that could have emerged as a hook over its two-and-a-half minutes. Once I watched a <a href=""http://vimeo.com/39440069"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">teaser video</a> for the song, however, I got it. I played the 45 seconds of geometrically spiraling incandescence over and over again. The visual, which looked a lot like the type of graphic art that saturates ISO50, activated certain pleasure centers that the song's steady repetition hadn't; the experience changed the way I heard much of the album afterward. In that respect, <i>Loyal </i>is similar to Hansen's work, which traffics similar principles of music as a means to aesthetics.</div>
</div>
<p>In his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16071-dive/"" target=""_blank"">review</a> of Tycho's <i>Dive</i>, Joe Colly said the album's downfall was its lack of tension. The same can be said of <i>Loyal</i>: even though the tension and release of Alexander's emotional struggles is part and parcel of the record, the album as a whole is meant to function as a reprieve from his anxiety. ""Beach Shelter"", which pulses with a low-range that threatens to engulf the track in an abyss of noise, and ""Lower Dome"", sparkling with synthesizers that might soundtrack interstitial plotting scenes in an 80s heist film, are vaguely disquieting. Still, they find their antitheses in the sweet relief of droning micro-permutations on the six-minute ""Raising Our Ashes"", and the similar, appropriately named ""Docile Touch"". Because these mood swings happen over the course of the album, however, they lack the urgency that characterizes a sought-after hook, which would give the album more presence.</p>
<p>That's not to say <i>Loyal </i>would benefit from instant gratification; rather definition. For the last song on the album, veteran Dutch producer Markus Guentner remixes ""Lower Dome"" to allow a glimpse into what the record might have sounded like if Alexander brought more of his Worst Friends disco sensibility to the table. (According to Heathered Pearls' page on Ghostly International's site, Alexander <a href=""http://ghostly.com/artists/heathered-pearls"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""always comes back to disco.""</a>) Guentner drops in a softly ticking house beat like something weighing on your mind, steadily increasing it in volume, dropping it out, and bringing it back with variegated beats, all with an acute sense of timing. It's not much, but it sharpens the synthesized drift and gives the song more of a purpose and destination. Plus, it's just more fun. And that might be the best way to alleviate stress.</p></div>"|17478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17478-loyal/|6.5|Harley Brown

Most of the songs on their 35-minute sophomore album are lean and compact: Like Canadian noise-rock contemporaries KEN Mode, KWC seem to realize muscular riffs and a little low-end can go a long way. Their straight-ahead character gives the shorter songs a sense of urgency and nervousness, resisting the temptation to meander. Standouts ""50s Dad"" and ""Wrong Side of History"", for instance, both show the band can crunch well. (""Dad""'s skronky leads also give it a Deftones-via-AmRep feel.) The more mid-tempo, at times doomy ""Beef Cattle"" flips the script, emphasizing clean sections amid Scott Evans' drill-sergeant shouts. “Cornerstone” slacks the pace and allows everything to breathe a little, but not with the sacrifice of tension.</p>
<p>These are all interesting variations on a basic template on an album that could've used more of those sorts of shifts. There's a fine line between an established atmosphere and the common complaint that ""all the songs sound the same."" For Kowloon Walled City, this problem shows up in Ships' two longer songs, the 7-minute <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14586-container-ships/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> and 9-minute closer ""You Don't Have Cancer"". The latter feels like a dragged out version of any given short song on the record-- there's nothing new, or at least fresh enough, to keep the atmosphere convincing. ""Cancer"", on the other hand, has moments of potential. At the 5:33 mark, for instance, a buildup collapses into a torrent of guitar and dual voices, but it doesn't surge with enough bombast to make it noteworthy. There's potential there, especially with the combatting high-low vocals, a tool that could have been even more of an onslaught then the guitars. In general, <i>Container Ships</i> is heavy, but often doesn't feel heavy enough. As these two longer songs highlight, they don't always make the most effective use of space, which for any band-- no matter how sprawling or how compact-- is crucial.</p>
<p>It's a bit frustrating. Kowloon Walled City are a band with the right stuff, and all the ingredients for a compelling album are present on <i>Container Ships</i>. It's just that they don't make everything come together in the most interesting ways. KWC have shown here and in the past that they've got the tools to be an above-average metal band; next time they need to make a piece of architecture we can all dance around, because considering the elevating demand for shriveling supplies of attention, ""ok"" is almost worse than ""unlistenable.""</p></div>"|17425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17425-container-ships/|6.4|Andy O'Connor

He traveled to the very fringes of what’s been dubiously dubbed freak-folk on <i>Buck Dharma</i>, and he settled in for hearthside romanticism and wanderlust on 2010’s Michael Gira-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14935-death-seat/"" target=""_blank""><i>Death Seat</i></a>. During his very brief tenure with Ryko, and under his given name, he experimented with the role of refined ringleader, guiding players like Nels Cline, John Dieterich, and Carla Bozulich through crackling, generally concise and great rock tunes. A year before, however he'd stretched ideas into 10- and 12-minute sprawls as the high-for-life Hassara. The enormity and variety of Toth's oeuvre confounds the usual appellations like singer and songwriter, bandleader, and pied piper; rather, he’s seemed mostly a headstrong musician, conceding one by one to an array of artistic impulses, for better and worse. </p>
<p>But on <i>Blood Oaths of the New Blues</i>, Wooden Wand's proper debut for British vanguard Fire Records, the sometimes-arduous job of tracing Toth's stylistic shifts culminates in an album that captures the best essences of his career in 41 seamless minutes. At once, Toth has merged the singer with the songwriter with the shaman, delivering some of his most potent lines with his most assured singing, surrounded by a band that seems to have learned rock 'n' roll's tropes only to stunt or subvert them. Like the finest work of Richard Buckner or Phosphorescent, <i>Blood Oaths of the New Blues</i> recasts songs that could have come from country music or the blues or Bob Dylan in an intricate Americana gloaming. At last, Toth treats the words <i>and</i> the arrangements with the same ingenuity and devotion, arriving at the most accessible and narcotic record of his career. </p>
<p>In 2011, Toth issued <i>Briarwood</i>, a strong country-rock set recorded in Homewood, Ala., with a quintet of area musicians. For the first time since Wooden Wand sloughed its Vanishing Voice suffix, the same supporting cast returns to a consecutive Toth effort for <i>Blood Oaths of the New Blues</i>. The ensemble's playing for <i>Briarwood</i> seems in retrospect almost like an entrance exam-- proficient and thorough, a demonstration of fundamentals for the new boss. Here, however, they use country, rock, and blues as origins and not endpoints, turning chances for obvious maneuvers into invitations for thoughtful subtlety and reinvention. Rather than resolve, guitar hooks hang like smoky rings and question marks in the air. Janet Elizabeth Simpson's gorgeous harmonies expertly trail just behind Toth, adding intrigue and ambiguity to the narration. Listen on headphones, and notice the layers of noise and backward vocals beneath the tracks, haunting these characters like old ghosts and bad memories.</p>
<p>With its wrapped lines of pedal steel and train-track rhythm, astral country trot ""Supermoon (The Sounding Line)"" demands the kind of long-winded guitar solo that a session musician such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Maines"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lloyd Maines</a> might happily supply. When the moment comes, though, Jody Nelson obliges only for an instant, easing quick bursts of notes from his pedal steel. He soon backs off, letting his notes gather instead into ponderous little clouds, reflecting the song's mix of resignation and wherewithal more than a properly fanciful solo ever would. And ""Outsider Blues"", a song that calls <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Fred_McDowell"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mississippi Fred McDowell</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_Fingers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Sticky Fingers </i></a>by name, lives up to its title by warping the shape of its blues travelogue with scrims of harsh noise and peripatetic hand drums, somewhere-in-space harmonies and refracted guitar leads. ""Southern Colorado Song"", the fiery rock number about <a href=""http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201201/dougherty-gang-crime-story"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the bank-robbing Dougherty Gang</a>, smolders rather than flares, omitting theatrics or solos so as to emphasize the undecided plight of its subjects-- American kids, lost without money or a clue, on the lam simply because ""sometimes nowhere seems the only place to go.""</p>
<p>Toth's portrait of the Doughterys is neither overly sympathetic nor judgmental. Their doomed escape across the American heartland was neither right nor wrong, he suggests-- it just <i>was</i>. That sense of existential acceptance permeates <i>Blood Oath of the New Blues</i>, affording songs ripped from the headlines or rescued from personal journals necessary empathy and intimacy. ""Dungeons of Irons"", for instance, examines the plight of suspected witches killed by paranoid citizens but pardoned centuries later, <a href=""http://www.thelocal.de/national/20120630-43473.html#.UOsljLTpbY8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">which actually happened in Cologne last year</a>. ""I hope nobody's got anything against me now,"" Toth sings, recognizing that, as a collective, we're still capable of excusing madness. During the brilliant opening gambit, a two-song medley called ""No Bed For Beatle Wand/Days This Long"", Toth wrestles with religion and luck, with anxiety and reassurance. ""Who can tell? Who can know? Who can see? It's hard to believe,"" he offers with the charisma of a soul singer, strangely comfortable as he asks questions he knows he'll never answer. Toth not only balances the strength of songs and arrangements here; he links aphorisms meant to be rolled around for a lifetime with details that suggest he's not only full of rhetorical shit.</p>
<p><i>Blood Oaths</i> closes with ""No Debts"", Toth's hopeful and simple two-minute love letter to a settled life. ""No debts/ no liens/ no postponement of dreams/ no more moving around,"" he sings over unadorned acoustic guitar chords, his voice and instrument mostly free of effects or artifice. The song sits strangely at the album's end, much like Dylan's charming ""Buckets of Rain"" served as the <a href=""http://en.wikihttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_on_the_Trackspedia.org/wiki/Blood_on_the_Tracks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unexpected epilogue</a> for the otherwise-arranged <i>Blood on the Tracks</i>. At first, these few verses might suggest a late addition to the album, a tune that the band simply didn't have time to treat. But the album begins with an arid drone for faint harmonium and backwoods electric guitar-- the sort of theme the latter-day version of Earth might release in happier times or that, back when freak-folk was in vogue, Wooden Wand &amp; the Vanishing Voice might have vamped on for an hour. Those bookends are symbolic of Toth's larger stylistic synthesis on <i>Blood Oaths</i>, a record that, as ""No Debts"" surmises, sees that Wooden Wand's ""ship has finally come in."" If you’ve liked anything Toth has done in the past, whether that's the tunes he's written or the textures he's conjured, <i>Blood Oaths</i> offers both, perhaps better than ever before. If you've dismissed him, though, this is the sound of one musician's prolific and mercurial path, reaching delightful new highs.</p></div>"|17489.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17489-blood-oaths-of-the-new-blues/|7.9|Grayson Currin

But <a href=""http://www.runegrammofon.com/artists/colin-stetson-mats-gustafsson/rcd-2136-colin-stetson-mats-gustafsson-stones-cd/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Stones</i></a>, recorded live at the 2011 Vancouver Jazz Festival, feels like a missed opportunity to exploit the natural tension between Stetson's methodical nature and Gustafsson's chaotic one. Instead, they both unleash their full artillery, easily bombarding the listener into submission. There are flashes of coherence and grace in all the furious noodling, but overall, you probably had to be there, bathed in the glory of mortal combat. Man and comically large sax are set against each other like rival armies, desperately vying for the same portion of breath. Stetson and Gustafsson overplay as if their lives were at stake, but these spectacular feats did not leave behind a very durable piece of recorded music.</p>
<p>When you think of free jazz featuring dual saxophone soloists, you might think of John Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hykgV1Ms-hM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Meditations</i></a>. Unlike that 1965 LP, <i>Stones</i> doesn't even give us rhythmic accompaniment to decode its mayhem, which makes the overblown notes of its landmark precursor sound quaint. Compass spinning crazily, Stetson and Gustafsson plow through a wilderness of harsh extended techniques recalling Peter Brötzmann's classic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27CpT79NMhQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Machine Gun</i></a>. But the fact that saxes can make unusual, abrasive sounds instead of groovy, mellow ones is no longer fresh news. Here, horns creak, barf, skitter, and spit, but seem perpetually in search of an overriding shape or thought. Anyone looking for the softening melodies of Stetson's solo work will be left clutching at scraps in the multiphonic splatter, such as the the tattered Dixieland drifting through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14640-stones-that-can-only-be/"" target=""_blank"">""Stones That Can Only Be""</a>. To free jazz atheists, the album may sound parodically bad, like carnage in a barnyard full of balloon animals periodically interrupted by chalkboard scribbling. More sympathetic listeners might wonder exactly what doesn't work.</p>
<p>The issue for me is a general top-heaviness that runs from the music's style, which can seem all embellishment and no structure, to the album's sequence. The first and longest of four tracks, ""Stones That Rest Heavily"", panic-sprints through what seems like the whole scorched playbook of unorthodox intonation for over 12 minutes. The overstuffing doesn't do it any favors. Soft, seductive passages and unison surges are hardly able to build any momentum before someone starts screaming through a reed and everything falls apart. More energy is spent than gathered, which makes the music feel slack and enervated, and the necessity to play every which way but normal bottoms out in unbearable goose-honks around the 10-minute mark. Not only does it make for an unwieldy opener, it leaves few new tricks for the rest of the album-- and little energy for us to invest in it.</p>
<p>Most of all, <i>Stones</i> is top-heavy with soloists. Between them, Stetson and Gustafsson make enough noise for five. What's missing is a drive shaft, and Stetson would have been the ideal person to provide it. Steady, powerful torque is what he does best. Who knows why he went off the rails, playing against his own strengths as well as the needs of the music. Perhaps the well-known <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Arcade Fire</a> sideman and solo auteur felt pressure to adapt to this very jazz context. Perhaps he wanted to show that he can also roam free, contrary to his reputation as a blinkered marathoner. Or maybe it just worked out that way in the moment. Regardless, the result is two musicians chasing each other around like squirrels, playfully yet rather pointlessly, going everywhere to get nowhere. But I can still imagine a tantalizing version of this collaboration where Stetson owns his lane, laying down a winding labyrinth of cool stone, and lets Gustafsson play the snorting, bucking Minotaur, a role that comes naturally to him.</p></div>"|17490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17490-stones/|4.4|Brian Howe

L.I.E.S.'s reach and reputation has outstripped its modest existence, and collector-allure is only a partial explanation. Influential European stores like Berlin's <a href=""http://hardwax.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hardwax</a> have championed the label, and there is a fervor surrounding Morelli &amp; co. that, frankly, few if any American labels have generated in the last decade. To speak plainly, the rise of L.I.E.S. is one of the most significant and encouraging developments in American underground electronic music in years.</p>
<p>Is it deserving of the attention? <i>American Noise</i> will not bash your skull in with newness. The styles it spans will be familiar to followers of electronic and experimental music. The music is held together by a sense of craft and a pervasive menace that ties the music to conjurers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"" target=""_blank"">Demdike Stare</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>. What makes L.I.E.S. special, what makes it more than simply another boutique underground label, is its frenetic pace and Morelli's uncanny ability to unearth heretofore unknown producers to place alongside slightly more established names like Maxmillion Dunbar and Xosar (Dutch workaholic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29894-legowelt/"" target=""_blank"">Legowelt</a> is the label's weightiest name).</p>
<p>It is an unparalleled collection of fresh talent: for the last two years it's basically been possible to blindly dig the L.I.E.S. crate and unearth something really good. That L.I.E.S. has managed this without tapping into any zeitgeist sound or scene-- the label's offerings span house, electro, kraut, and noise among others-- is all the more impressive. These contributions range from the cauldron-black psychedelia of Jahiliyya Fields to the tipsy motorik of Torn Hawk. House classicist Delroy Edwards and Bookworms-- whose shimmering odyssey ""African Rhythms"" goes toe-to-toe with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29516-daphni/"" target=""_blank"">Daphni</a>'s remix of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpFLKu43Ax0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ne Noya</a>"" for the best use of an African vocal sample in a loaded year-- are just two artists who released their first-ever works for L.I.E.S. in 2012. Then there's ""Journey I."" by Unknown Artist, 12 unspooling minutes of pickled funk, possibly the finest example of the intersection between noise and dance music on the label. If there's been little speculation about who the hell these artists are, it's because it's a lot more fun to imagine Morellli having access to some heretofore unknown mine of talent.</p>
<p>It's instructive that one of L.I.E.S.'s best tracks is attributed to an anonymous producer. Central to the popularity of L.I.E.S. is its mythology. There's a secret clubhouse feel to the label, a sense that this is music made and presented the right way, or the old way, or at least in a way that is shielded from the constant deluge of novelty and bullshit that normally accompanies discovering a hot scene. That the music has been so uniformly good-- and that the label has cultivated this feeling naturally-- means this is a fun bonus and not some vague fetishistic moralizing.</p>
<p>Ultimately the only disappointing thing about <i>American Noise</i> is that it can't benefit from the evocative, imagination-stoking intrigue of the label's physical products. It's a 2xCD label compilation, not a message in a bottle. Mixing classics with some fresh productions, though, does give the label's output a sense of uniformity, and helps define ""American noise"" as basically anything that can result from someone sitting down with a synthesizer and a drum machine. It's a big, vague idea that is harnessed by L.I.E.S.'s comparative smallness. So if <i>American Noise</i> pulls the curtain back some, it's only because this music is simply too good not to share, which is presumably the impetus for the label existing in the first place. Come for the unearthed classics, stay for the next transmission from Morelli's mystic jam generator.</p></div>"|17507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17507-lies-presents-american-noise/|8.1|Andrew Gaerig

In 1998, the Tall Ships, a fleet of traditionally rigged wooden boats, visited Falmouth harbor for a momentous race. South Crofty closed, the final stronghold of the county's historic tin-mining industry. In 1999, Cornwall's cliffs proved one of the best vantage points to witness a rare solar eclipse. These events were chronicled in my primary school exercise books, as they no doubt were in those of fellow young Falmouth-originators Ric Phethean, Matt Parker, and Jamie Bush, the trio that comprise the now Brighton-based post-rock band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30557-tall-ships/"" target=""_blank"">Tall Ships</a>.</p>
<p>Although it'd be a push to suggest that those events directly fed into their long-time-coming debut album, <i>Everything Touching</i>, it's tempting to backtrack from their name and read the influence of those ancient, fleeting, stargazing industries into their music in order to give it some sense of place. Following two EPs, the band's <a href=""http://www.bsmrocks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Big Scary Monsters</a> debut doesn't capture the ferocity of their live shows, which have been consistently powerful enough to keep people hanging on for a debut proper several years after the fact.</p>
<p>In terms of palpable influence, <i>Everything Touching</i> cherry-picks from all over the place: Youthmovies Soundtrack Strategies' post-00s math leanings, Oceansize's cliff-view sprawl, the more swashbuckling strains of Okkervil River and Modest Mouse, M83's downcast glimmer, and Sigur Rós' misty yawn. Not that there's any particular Cornish sound, aside from perhaps Rephlex and Aphex Twin's output, but the way the peninsula county juts out and only shares a single 50-mile border with the next one up, combined with the fact that bands rarely tour there, make it an ideal haven for weird sounds to flourish. No pinning the blame for the county's lack of musical adventurism on Tall Ships at all, but it's kind of a shame that their early relative isolation didn't beget innovation, but a smooth alchemization of other bands' styles.</p>
<p>That's not to say that <i>Everything Touching</i> is a bad record. To anyone who hasn't heard the aforementioned bands, it'll probably seem quite wonderful, rendered equal parts industrially cathartic and beautifully meditative. And for those who'd cite those bands as part of some indie-math ABCs, Tall Ships' own specific brand of alchemy is a good place to start when discussing their charms rather than limitations: the band's 2010 EP, <i>There is Nothing But Chemistry Here</i> had a distinctly geological, scientific bent to its lyrics, discussing romance in terms of fissures and tectonic shifts-- using the language of textbooks to be anything but, as it were.</p>
<p>That's less prominent here, though the lovely ""Ode to Ancestors"" is carried over from EP to album, a quiet, glimmering thing worthy of a Sigur Rós support slot for the first half, a stomping skitter for the second. ""You are a triumph of natural selection/ Every mutation leading to your perfection… This is my ode to your ancestors/ Appreciate your recipe/ Their million-year masterpiece,"" Phethean sings in somewhat gloopy fashion, but deserving an A for lovelorn effort nonetheless. On the siren-stomp of ""Phosphorescence"", recollection of a star-lit midnight skinny dip mounts to a cawed, knotty chorus where the sea's depths only come to emphasize the naked swimmers' worldly insignificance.</p>
<p>However, it's a limited lyrical theme, and one that's prone, as the title suggests, to get bowled over at the view of the stars and veer into ""did you ever think about…"" stoner wonder. And in terms of musical focus, <i>Everything Touching</i> could do with a narrower remit: the transition from ""Phosphorescence"" to the angular, melancholy ""Oscar"" feels like it's bridging two different bands, and the climax provided by the bowling <i>Katamari</i> build of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13838-gallops/"" target=""_blank"">""Gallop""</a> is wasted on the subsequent earnest, widdly closed-eye epic of ""Idolatry"".</p>
<p>Although <i>Everything Touching</i> is post-rock at its most winsome, and rarely unpleasant to listen to, closer ""Murmurations"" might be the key to understanding why several years of triumphant live shows hasn't translated into the ultimate debut album. At nine minutes long, it builds with a kind of tender promise that feels pretty transcendent and transporting as the final song of an encore, but lacks the craft to sit within the context of what's essentially a 10-song indie rock record. But as with those historic events, perhaps for Tall Ships it's about being there, rather than experiencing it in replica form.</p></div>"|17432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17432-everything-touching/|6.0|Laura Snapes

As the 1970s New York punk scene oral history <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Please-Kill-Me-Uncensored-History/dp/0802142648"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Please Kill Me</i></a> notes, the other members of the Dolls had grown weary of touring with drug addicts, anyway. That same week, Richard Hell quit Television. So Thunders called Hell, asked if he wanted to start a new band, and boom: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heartbreakers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Heartbreakers</a>, the first great punk rock supergroup, was born. You can see them on <a href=""http://bookcritics.org/images/uploads/pkm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that book's cover</a> with blood on their shirts and perfect hair.</p>
<p>Soon after the band came together, Hell left-- he and Thunders had different ideas about who should be the frontman. Before his departure he co-wrote the junkie anthem ""Chinese Rocks"" with Dee Dee Ramone, which became a Heartbreakers standard, and later, the centerpiece of the band's 1977 album <i>L.A.M.F.</i> (short for ""like a motherfucker""; the Ramones eventually recorded their version of the song for the Phil Spector-produced 1980 LP <i>End of the Century.)</i> ""Chinese Rocks"" sticks out on <i>L.A.M.F</i>. In the middle of an LP of songs written by Thunders, Nolan, and Walter Lure, here's a track emblazoned with the Ramones' <a href=""http://buildinternet.com/wp-content/uploads/ramones.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crest</a>. It's got a Ramones-sounding chorus and chord progression, and a grim-but-lighthearted purview of drug culture that's also present on ""Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue"". The biggest tell, though, comes when Thunders sings, ""Hey, is Dee Dee home?""</p>
<p>Thematically, however, it's the perfect fit for <i>L.A.M.F.</i>, and not just because Thunders was a well-known junkie. It works with the rest of the record's sex-focused, dirtbag mentality. Just look at a few of the central lines from their songs: ""I never ever needed it so bad,"" they sing in the chorus of ""Pirate Love"". They've got a ""one track mind,"" they're ""born to lose."" The message isn't subtle: They're lonely losers looking for love, lust, and smack. Such straightforward lyrical sentiments were a cornerstone of New York punk.</p>
<p>Like their peers in the city, the Heartbreakers took classic rock'n'roll archetypes and gave them extra doses of fuzz, muscle, and bite. Considering there were two New York Dolls in the band and that band's self-titled debut had a masterful handle of tough, glammy rock'n'roll, it makes sense. The impressive thing on <i>L.A.M.F.</i>, then, isn't the power-- it's the diversity in their songs. At the center of the album, there's Nolan's hamfisted caveman crash in ""I Wanna Be Loved"", which is followed by the jangling ballad ""It's Not Enough"", and that leads to ""Chinese Rocks"". Unlike the Ramones, the songs don't come across as loose clones of one another-- they each have their own feeling and sound. Some of them, like ""Goin' Steady"", even have killer guitar solos.</p>
<p><i>L.A.M.F.</i>'s initial release was marred by an awful mix (to get an idea, do a quick compare and contrast with <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/junglerecords/heartbreakers-born-to-lose"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the mud mix</a> and <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/junglerecords/heartbreakers-born-to-lose-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the restored mix</a> for album opener ""Born to Lose""), but a cleaned-up version of the album emerged in 1994. The <i>Definitive Edition</i> takes the re-working even further, offering the '94 mix as well as an additional new remaster. The first two discs sound pretty similar, the bottom line being that they're both clean and listenable. Disc four features several alternate versions of the album's tracks, which were largely traded out for a reason (though it's definitely interesting to hear the alternate Thunders vocals and slightly different instrumental arrangements).</p>
<p>For people already familiar with the album, the real draw of this box is disc three, which features demos with Richard Hell in the band. It's three Thunders-written tracks from the album, ""I Wanna Be Loved"", ""Pirate Love"", and ""Goin' Steady"", plus a fourth, Walter Lure's ""Flight"". They were culled from a 1976 recording session, and unfortunately missing from this collection are the same session's recordings with Hell's vocals: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWu_NlU4t3c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Love Comes in Spurts""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlMhd1zsQQo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Blank Generation""</a> (both from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hell_and_the_Voidoids"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Blank Generation</i></a>), ""Hurt Me"", ""Can't Keep My Eyes on You"", and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD_cU3h38Xs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chinese Rocks""</a>. Ultimately, the more interesting demos on disc three are the late '76, super raw, post-Hell tracks that showcase Thunders both as ""the dangerous one"" and as ""ballad slinging heartthrob.""</p>
<p>The album proper closes with their cover of ""Do You Love Me"". In the spoken intro, Thunders sets the tone by going unhinged as he barks out, ""I can <i>really</i> SHAKE 'EM <i>DOWN</i>."" Their take is muscular, full of flat harmonies, and even while they sound like they're having fun, there's a definite ""hide your daughters"" feel to their delivery. When the Heartbreakers grunt ""WORK, WORK"" in the background, they sound less like back-up singers and more like enablers. Obviously, the song comes from a genuine affection for old R&amp;B, but the <i>L.A.M.F. </i>version feels like the forbear to the 1980s punk/hardcore covers of ""Louie, Louie"" (captured on the Chicago punk documentary <a href=""http://www.factorytwentyfive.com/ftf3/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>You Weren't There</i></a>). Today, you can hear the pangs of Thunders' melodies and attitude in records from In the Red, Dirtnap, and Slovenly. When I <a href=""http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/07/trash-collector-timmy-vulgars-raw-sewage-roq/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talked to him</a> last year, Timmy Vulgar of Human Eye and Timmy's Organism namedropped the Heartbreakers as some of his favorite trashy rock'n'roll; this from the Detroit maniac who released <a href=""http://www.midheaven.com/item/raw-sewage-roq-by-timmys-organism-cd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Raw Sewage</i> <i>Roq</i></a>. </p>
<p>The 12-track source material of <i>L.A.M.F.</i> is founders' punk gold, cleaned off so the masses can indulge. But does this box set really offer enough substance to span four discs? Unless you're a Thunders fanatic, not really. Even the Richard Hell demos feel like a missed opportunity. There are definitely added perks in the box, including some badass ""Born to Lose"" buttons and a detailed timeline of the band's history. But the important thing is the album at the core of this collection. It's a solid bunch of punk rock songs, and it's Johnny Thunders' most essential document.</p></div>"|17326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17326-johnny-thunders-the-heartbreakers-lamf-the-lost-77-mixes-special-edition/|8.4|Evan Minsker

The details become meaningful as they drain into the visual world, saturating it. The effect is uniquely powerful outdoors, as though the music, having been extracted from nature, replenishes its intensity. The sky seems bluer and more finely graded, uniquely composed against the dark treetops. You feel a significance in a lone contrail, a cosmic purpose in a pattern of light and shade. Ambient musicians have diligently reinforced these visual associations, shoring up abstract flutters and waves with sturdy images of mountains, forests, seas, and stars.</p>
<p>This is why <a href=""http://felte.bandcamp.com/album/billow-observatory"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Billow Observatory</a> may be the perfect ambient band name, arranging the indifferent sky in proportion to the solitary witness who gives it meaning. The duo's long-gestating debut easily calls to mind drenching sunrises, glittering constellations, and sailing clouds, richly furnishing the familiar sense of hovering over vast natural orders that you're also inside. But while the music is effective and finely wrought, it's slightly checked by the same schematic feel as the group's name. Mannered, well-balanced gloriousness doesn't allow much room for surprise, and pat postcard vistas start to intrude before the album exhausts its considerable length.  </p>
<p>Billow Observatory is Jonas Munk, who records ambient glitch music as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2671-manual/"">Manual</a>, and Jason Kolb, guitarist for the shoegaze band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/163-auburn-lull/"">Auburn Lull</a>. Reportedly, this record is the result of years of online audio file swapping, and it shows in a compulsive lack of stray hairs; an obsessive attention to proportion and timbre. It was created largely with analog sources and electric guitars, recorded live and then processed into glowing smears, periodic spasms of rhythm, filaments of texture. Only rarely, notably on ""Ambros"", does anything like the liquid shredding of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1624-fripp-eno/"">Fripp and Eno</a>'s seminal ambient guitar music emerge. The guitar processing more resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"">Fennesz </a>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3935-stars-of-the-lid/"">Stars of the Lid</a>, refracting minimal harmonic material through a tonal prism.</p>
<p>The music is often pillowy and edgeless, with even its handful of rougher textures yoked into a slow, interpenetrating tumble. Soft bass and a metallic twist play through the high, mottled drone of ""Slow Billows"", depth-charges seem to boom through the unusually bracing ""Dim Language"", and ""Helsinki Radio"" takes a fine comb to the tonality and grain of, you guessed it, static. More often, we get subtle variations on certain durable timbres, such as the heavenly chorus pouring through the clouds of ""Calumet"" or the faux-strings-and-winds of ""Pankalia"".</p>
<p>You have to mill down the over-familiar language to hear the standouts, such as ""Kronstadt"", which has an enchanting feel of slowed down, staggered plainsong. But passages of quiet inspiration are diluted by inundation. After working on it for so long, you can understand why Munk and Kolb overstuffed the record, but it might have benefitted from losing the excessively long, three-part ""Bilocation"" suite at the end-- at least if the second part didn't bring a welcome rhythmic jolt to the placid motion. I'm left wondering if ambient music's connection to nature has become simply reflexive. There is something hall-of-mirrors-like about it: <a href=""http://www.world-science.net/othernews/060809_spheres.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stars actually do make sounds</a>, which resemble the ones ambient musicians synthesize for looking at stars. One starts to yearn for a break in the circuit. Long, revolving tones make for easy cosmic or biospheric allegories, but with a little more daring and imagination, couldn't they conjure all kinds of other things as well?</p></div>"|17461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17461-billow-observatory/|6.0|Brian Howe

Hecker commissioned Iranian author and philosopher Reza Negarestani to compose a libretto, ""The Snake, the Goat and the Ladder (A board game for playing chimera)"", as fodder for a new work. He then asked nine people to deliver the piece in English, German, or Negarestani's native language, Farsi, subsequently recording the readings in Massachusetts Institute of Technology's anechoic chambers, studio rooms designed to limit the echo of or interference with the voices themselves.</p>
<p>For Hecker, the purity and coherence of these nine takes became controls for what is perhaps his most ambitious experiment to date: three separate albums in three languages, made by recombining and reconfiguring the readings until the voices merged into one strange storytelling beast and until the tale itself became a tangle of internal hyperlinks, footnotes, and asides. The purpose of Hecker's mythical chimera (that is, ""The Snake, the Goat and the Ladder,"" or any system that fuses disparate parts of several seperate ones, whether in <a href=""http://www.theoi.com/Ther/Khimaira.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mythology</a> or <a href=""http://www.heromachine.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Chimera.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fantasy</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">science</a>) would be twofold: to challenge the personalities we assign to literary characters and to contest the ease they afford narrative comprehension. He's expanded the system <a href=""http://primaryinformation.org/index.php?/upcoming/florian-hecker/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to print</a>, too.</p>
<p>If that seems complicated, <i>Chimerization</i> sounds precisely so, too: I've listened to the English version of <i>Chimerization</i> a dozen or more times now and read most everything I can about the record, from extensive press notes to a <a href=""http://chimerization.documenta.de/download/102_Florian_Hecker_Notebook.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">multi-lingual introductory dossier</a> for the material. And I still don't grasp the full breadth of what Hecker, Negarestani, and their itinerant readers have accomplished here. And to an extent, that's the purpose of the game. Across these 33 uninterrupted minutes, Hecker layers, bowties, refracts, reverses, and otherwise disrupts the trio of voices reading the work. Syllables careen into unseen voids or sublimate into sudden glitches. Phrases chase one another in unsettling antiphony, and sentences jerk to seasick rhythms. Hecker sometimes allows entire thoughts to pass uninterrupted through his filters, conveying chunks of information-- ""each carrying its own respective space within the beast,"" one voice manages, describing the constitution of the chimera-- meant to be decoded and reconnected through obsessive plays. <i>Chimerization </i>constructs a board game for what Hecker calls ""repeated, 'active' listening,"" where the details have been scrambled in a way that ultimately allows them to be reconnected into a complete picture. Playing depends upon obsession, and begets it.</p>
<p>But piecing the puzzle together isn't tedious because, despite how academic and conceptual Hecker's work often is, he also possesses a strong sense of forward motion, even as he scatters this story like crumbs. On his previous LP, the brilliant and expansive <i>Speculative Solution</i>, Hecker achieved a rare momentum for this fringe field of electronics by daisy-chaining multiple techniques. Harsh bursts instantly billowed into ultraviolet drones or carousel-like melodies. Such constant motion made those four pieces feel restless but unified. Hecker employs the same approach on <i>Chimerization</i>, linking harsh whirs to playful skitters, soft static to sudden and strong beats. At alternate points, <i>Chimerization</i> suggests the warped humanity of early tape music, the digital arrays of Oval, the thick pulses of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"" target=""_blank"">Throbbing Gristle</a>, and the goofy dance music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1012-dat-politics/"" target=""_blank"">DAT Politics</a>. During one kinetic pass late in the piece, he invokes the cartoon sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15826-raymond-scott/"" target=""_blank"">Raymond Scott</a>. Listening to <i>Chimerization</i> must be what it feels like for a household cat to chase a laser pointer across an empty living room wall, constantly scanning left and right and up and down, too busy to be distracted.</p>
<p>Despite its musical movement and panoply of allusions, <i>Chimerization</i> remains, above all, staunchly theoretical, but its very fount of intrigue is in its challenging nature. If the invitation to decode a long, scrambled tale recited by multiple people and wrecked by a fierce iconoclast doesn't register as its own silver lining, perhaps <i>Chimerization</i> is your avoidable rabbit hole. Otherwise, Hecker has built a multivalent system of exploration, where our central storytelling instrument-- that is, the human voice-- has become equal parts messenger, trickster and mystery.</p></div>"|17468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17468-chimerization/|7.8|Grayson Currin

And Ruscha's other notable project, the Laughing Light of Plenty (made with famed UK, SF, and NYC DJ Thomas Bullock), released one of 2008's <a href=""http://youtu.be/dNvBtaqjba8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stone Rosiest dance singles</a>, but then released <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Laughing-Light-Of-Plenty-Laughing-Light-Of-Plenty/release/2570893"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a full-length album</a> that I defy you to find, already deemed ""lost"" even though it dates from 2010. Almost all of Ruscha's music remains secret.</p>
<p>Soon after Medicine achieved mid-level grunge-era success (even landing a cameo in <i>The Crow</i>), Ruscha bowed out of rock altogether to dabble bedroom-woven electronica being crafted by the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a>. It's that sort of <i>Selected Ambient Works</i>-worthy playfulness that comes to mind in sampling <i>Tropical Psychedelics</i>, released on England's finely attuned Emotional Response imprint. (Their reissue arm-- Emotional Rescue-- has also had a pretty decent year.) The album also caps Secret Circuit's rather overt 2012, wherein his quirky take on homespun electronic music began to gain more exposure via singles on the Beats in Space label and on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/"" target=""_blank"">Prins Thomas</a>' Internasjonal.</p>
<p>Drawing on music dating back to when Ruscha first left Medicine (a quick scan of Secret Circuit's <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Secret+Circuit"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">entry on Discogs</a> reveals over a decade of self-released CDs and cassettes), this 12-track collection finds the music hard to peg to any particular era or trend. Analog components, modular synthesizers, and dusty drum machines underpin nearly every track. Opener ""White Wish"" has a winsome melody flutter about as a beat ticks underneath, but then a plucked nylon-string figure appears, replaced soon after by a warm'n'fuzzy psych guitar flare-up, before returning to its simple components. The cleverly named ""Afrobotics"" feels both primitive and futuristic, a roiling tom-tom getting topped with multiple layers of spy theme guitar, modular synth gurgles and squalls, even a dash of wordless vocals from Ruscha, the cumulative effect of all these overdubbed tracks never feeling cluttered.</p>
<p>The acoustic guitar foregrounded on ""Moon Life"" and the swirling noise interlude of ""Angel's Eyes"" nod back to 1996's <i>Cosmic Sword #1</i>, while the piano recital-meets-Conrad Schnitzler noise of ""Psouvenirs"" was available on Secret Circuit's 2010 Bandcamp album of the same name (another piano sketch, ""Piano Waltz"", has similar components). You can just make out that clatter and voices of children in the background of the former, suggesting a sketch rendered with the same sense of play. The most taut rhythm tracks appear on ""Winded Up on the Floor"" and ""Lagoland"", the former having the earmarks of early acid tracks while the latter features a buzzing kalimba lick that could come right off of a Congotronics album. Most of the album tracks are mindful to not wear out their welcome, with only three ventures beyond the four-minute mark.</p>
<p>Most of the album's pacing comes at a fugue-like, breezy speed, somewhere between the Balearic sensibilities of a new generation of producers (see the International Feel label and DJ Harvey's Sarcastic Study Masters) as well as the strange sort of punch-drunk exotica evoked by Yellow Magic Orchestra's Haroumi Hosono, with the casual sway of ""Foggy Twilights"" and ""Walkin' on Water"" conjuring island sunsets. Ruscha's curious sensibilities remain intact across <i>Tropical Psychedelics</i>, making the album an idiosyncratic yet satisfying listen. And with a new crop of L.A. producers like Suzanne Kraft, Pacific Horizons, and SFV Acid taking cues from Ruscha's peculiar soundworld, Secret Circuit may yet become overt.</p></div>"|17442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17442-tropical-psychedelics/|7.6|Andy Beta

Music built from other music that doesn't so much envision a new world as recreates an old one that only feels, distantly, like it ever existed to begin with.</p>
<p><i>Silent Congas </i>could be compared to-- or mistaken for-- the work of several other artists. Both here and on 2009's <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/larrygus/sets/stitches/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Stitches</i></a>, Gus does his European takes on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">J Dilla</a> (""Hutting"") and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> (""Circular Obsidian""). On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14563-contours-sway/"">""Contours Sway""</a>, he is not only <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25477-the-avalanches/"" target=""_blank"">the Avalanches</a> in general, but ""Since I Left You"" specifically. Nobody will hear <i>Silent Congas</i> and think, <i>there's that Larry Gus sound!</i> because there isn't a Larry Gus sound.</p>
<p>The music Gus makes is in a sense predicated on anonymity. But when making music from other music, the bar for some sense of authorship is set even higher. He has to make his samples have to say something with him that they couldn't say without him. Here, they seem to say things like ""whoa"" repeatedly-- not a bad message per se, but one that can benefit from complication. Ironically, when Gus sings, he mumbles. </p>
<p><i>Congas</i> feels like an album that doesn't hit a high mark in part because it seems to have aimed low in the first place. The mystical, jazzy aspects of it allude to a depth that the songs' brief runtimes and basic structures don't make room for-- ""Circular Obsidian"", for example, feels like a two-minute preview for a version of itself that could be 10 times as long. Music like this is essentially a kind of audio collage, and, like collage, <i>Silent Congas</i> has huge potential for strange and revealing juxtapositions between different kinds of sounds, although it winds up being a friendly place for lots of compatible sounds to mingle rather than anything profound.</p></div>"|17472.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17472-silent-congas/|5.8|Mike Powell

The music has lived on with enough ubiquity that even if you've never gone near classic rock radio, you've probably heard it over the credits of a TV show, or playing in the supermarket, or on the car stereo of a teenager born in 1996. It's the top-level stuff you'll hear, of course: Zeppelin, Free, Cream, Deep Purple, Van Halen... those bands sold millions of records, but trailing in their wake were hundreds more that would have been happy to sell out a private pressing of 500. Enterprising reissue labels and so-called sharity bloggers have done much to shed light on this music in the last 10 or so years, and it feels as if we'll never run out.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Once you fall into that world, the pull of the rabbit hole seems to increase exponentially. This is an effect surely felt by Andy Votel and Doug Shipton, the compilers of <i>Man Chest Hair</i>, a set whose cheeky title references the English city of Manchester, host to a thriving hard rock scene during the 70s. The two collectors have brought together a rough assortment of tracks documenting the era here, focusing entirely on rock bands of low-to-no commercial fortune. One of the joys of exploring this old music is discovering the incredible diversity of sounds that can exist under a single generic umbrella like hard rock. The groups here range from straightforward boogie outfits to heavy prog, proto-metal, almost-punk, glam, and down-the-middle pop rock acts, with hints of folk and blues as well.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Certainly, the <i>Man Chest Hair</i> title is worth more than a bad pun: nearly every musician heard here was male (JC Heavy's vocalist is the lone exception), and this stuff was recorded during the wild, shirtless heyday of loud rock and roll, before punk taught people to be ashamed of ambition, or to at least act ashamed of it. No, these bands were aiming for the cheap seats in venues where every seat was cheap, or there were no seats at all. Oscar, a band that also played under the name Royal Variety Show, open the disc with ""Good Lovin' Woman"", which was likely selected to go first because it sounds like some sort of cosmic mean of 70s hard rock. It's got a bit of funk in its step, a lot of crunch in its guitars, ample cowbell, lusty vocals, and free-spirited attitude that roll together almost every quality that put this music on the top of the heap in its original moment.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The biggest highlight for me is ""King Dick II"", by the Way We Live. The song has a great, cycling riff, kicked along by busy but ruthlessly effective drumming, and the lyrics encouraging you to ""practice witchcraft with your friends"" are a pretty hilarious send-up of both hippie ideals and the panicked reaction to them. This band changed its name to Tractor, released a great album, and then settled into the festival circuit, which makes them one of the longer-lived acts on the compilation. By comparison, So On and So Forth hasn't even received the honor of a Rate Your Music entry, though their cover of Cream's ""Sweet Wine"" is quite a bit better than the original. Same goes for the excellently named Urbane Gorilla, whose buzzy sax/guitar riffs on ""Ten Days Gone"" help compensate for the amateurish vocal and turn the song into a thrashing stomper.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Not every song is a winner. Stackwaddy, one of the better-known bands included here, turns in a lumbering, momentumless plodder on ""Hunt the Stag"", and the demo-level quality of other songs doesn't serve the big sounds these groups were aiming for particularly well. These are more than balanced out by the presence of unearthed gems like Grisby Dyke's ""Nebula"", which veers wildly from heavy prog instrumental passages topped by flute, and folk-y, waltz time verses. Likewise, Slipped Disc switches things up a bit with their funky, harmony-flecked ""Come On In"", a song that was clearly pointed toward the charts, even if it stood little chance of hitting them. (Their vocalist also sounds ever so slightly like Robert Wyatt.)</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Man Chest Hair</i> occasionally drags, and can't boast more than a handful of tracks that will flip anyone's lid outside of 70s rock enthusiast circles. One does wonder if there were more fully realized gems that got passed over in favor of more obscure, unissued material when this set was being assembled. I'll extend the benefit of the doubt to the compilers and suppose that they picked what they thought best told the story of a city alive with rock and roll during the brief window in which hard rock truly ruled the world, and the upstart bands that trailed in the wake of Led Zeppelin thought they might be able to secure just a bit of that power for themselves.</p></div>"|17417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17417-man-chest-hair/|7.1|Joe Tangari

In their 16 years together as a group, through various lineup changes that saw them ultimately shaved down to the duo of Trish Keenan and James Cargill, they released just four full-length studio albums. There was certainly a decent amount of other work that sprung up in the gaps between those records, but often a protracted silence would settle on the band. It wasn't hard to imagine a permutation of the Broadcast lineup locked away in a studio during those times, agonizing over pink noise settings, crafting a set of lyrics that sat just right with Keenan's detached delivery, mulling over sleeve design with longtime cohort Julian House of <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Focus+Group"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Focus Group</a>. As the world outside sped up they seemed to slow down, getting a little more lost in their own sound with every passing year.</p>
<p>Their final work together before Keenan's sad passing in 2011, the manic cut-and-paste Focus Group collaboration <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13560-investigate-witch-cults-of-the-radio-age/""><i>Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age</i></a>, spewed Broadcast out into a disorienting space, deliberately clipping their pop wings. Their live shows from that era further emphasized the feeling, with Keenan and Cargill performing in near darkness, facing one another while hunched over tables laden with equipment, barely even acknowledging the presence of the audience. The sense of retreat from those shows was overpowering, even if it was the natural product of the insular existence the pair seemed to fall into over the course of their career. In the beginning they had easily traceable peers-- labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>, fellow Birmingham bands <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3336-plone/"">Plone</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3382-pram/"">Pram</a>-- but by the time of <i>Witch Cults</i> they were mostly out on their own. Even the ""hauntology"" sub-genre felt too parochial for a band that had such potentially limitless scope within its grasp.</p>
<p>It feels appropriate that one of Keenan and Cargill's final works together is a largely instrumental soundtrack to filmmaker Peter Strickland’s 2012 feature <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1833844/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Berberian Sound Studio</i></a>. The film follows a British man who travels to Italy in the 1970s to work on the sound design of a schlocky giallo movie, only to be driven to the point of self-destruction by his own creations. Broadcast are a natural fit for such a project, their working methods clearly mirroring the obsessive, isolationist approach of Strickland's central character. Their music often has a filmy <i>élan</i> to it, bearing traces of composers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24753-krzysztof-komeda/"">Krzysztof Komeda</a>'s work for Roman Polanski and <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lubo%C5%A1+Fi%C5%A1er"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Luboš Fišer</a>'s score for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066516/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Valerie and Her Week of Wonders</i></a>. It's not clear who did what here-- Keenan and Cargill began working on this project together, with the latter completing the score after Keenan's passing-- but it picks up on the similarly fractured thread sewn throughout <i>Witch Cults</i>, with 39 tracks included, many of them barely making it over the one-minute mark. </p>
<p>That Broadcast were still working deeply in the abstract suggests they were keen to further explore the ideas embedded in that last record. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44733-broadcast-working-on-new-album/"">According</a> to Cargill, we may find that out at some point in the future. For now, all we have is this, an album that arches away from <i>Witch Cults</i> in subtle ways, dialling down the self-consciously quirky material that periodically surfaced on that record and bringing a conspicuous feeling of terror closer to the surface. <i>Berberian Sound Studio</i> is all bone-chilling screams, deep red blood spilling across decaying celluloid, knives being raised pointedly in the air. It's the work of people enamored by the common devices of horror, who want to see how pliable that material is so they can find their own entry point into it.</p>
<p>This isn't an album easily broken down into tracks, but the influence of Herk Harvey's sinister organ grind from the classic <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055830/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Carnival of Souls</i></a> surfaces sporadically (""Beautiful Hair"", ""Treatise"") as do great bursts of menacing analog synth reminiscent of Fabio Frizzi's score for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080057/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Zombie Flesh Eaters</i></a> (""Mark of the Devil"", ""Found Scalded, Found Drowned""). Elsewhere, pieces of dialog from the film are regularly worked in, often through creepily whispered female voices reminiscent of a similar trick deployed on Goblin's <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076786/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Suspiria</i></a> soundtrack (""Monica's Burial"", ""Anima di Cristo""). Occasionally there are even Broadcastian touches-- the keyboard refrain on ""The North Downs Dimension"" is noticeably similar to the one deployed on ""You and Me in Time"" from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/948-tender-buttons/""><i>Tender Buttons</i></a>. But mostly this is an attempt at subtlety emulating the work of others, of generating chills from an eerie sparseness (the quite beautiful ""Teresa, Lark of Ascension"") or from dense, compact forms (the strident ""The Equestrian Vortex""). </p>
<p>What prevents <i>Berberian Sound Studio</i> from being a genre exercise is the care taken to paper over the cracks, to find some common ground between droney, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"">Popol Vuh</a>-type material (""Valeria’s Burial (Under the Fort)"") and more visceral horror soundtrack work (the positively seething ""The Game's Up""). It's undoubtedly derived from that high level of fastidiousness Keenan and Cargill always applied to their work together, but it also demonstrates what big-picture thinkers they were, able to forge unseen connections between disparate, barely heard musicians. It's what gives an album like this, drawn from so many sources, a recognizable identity of its own, and it's what gave their ever-evolving career a solid grounding in a world that was recognizably theirs.</p></div>"|17492.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17492-berberian-sound-studio-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/|7.4|Nick Neyland

He has a manifesto for how he records music-- no sampling other artists, no drum machines, no synths. It sounds mighty ascetic, but the prolific Brit has been responsible for some of the past decade-and-change's most natural-sounding dance music. 1998's <i>Around the House</i> saw him incorporating household sounds; 2001's <i>Bodily Functions</i> moved inward, building songs from samples of the human body. It was easily Herbert's most audacious idea at that point.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Bodily Functions</i> is even more stretch-your-legs-out luxurious than <i>House</i>. The beats don't sound like flatulence, belches, or growling stomachs, but there <i>is</i> something very organic about the record. The drums feel squishy, the rhythms are padded, and everything moves with an elegance that most house could only dream of (no drum machines, remember). ""Leave Me Now"" and ""You Saw It All"" are relatively raucous stompers fashioned from gasping snares and wet rattling, while the very strange ""Foreign Bodies"" is like early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/"" target=""_blank"">Ricardo Villalobos</a> mapped out in human flesh.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It's as much of a jazz album as a house album. <i>Around the House</i> already had plenty of jazz leanings, but this record makes them explicit-- horns that sigh like deep exhales, scrumptious, meaty bass. The album is punctuated by brief meanderings away from house, like the cocktail lounge opener ""You're Unknown to Me"" or the straight-up ""I Know"", which is four and a half minutes of pure jazz vamp with Herbert's own delectable piano work. These pieces serve to open the album up into its inviting, expansive whole. </span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Bodily Functions</i> also continued Herbert's fruitful collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4055-dani-siciliano/"" target=""_blank"">Dani Siciliano</a>, a smooth singer whose jazzy inflections go well with this album's tasteful house. She's as much the star of <i>Bodily Functions </i>as Herbert is, her pleasantly husky voice inhabiting the album's warm atmosphere. Her calm, gently emotive personality makes tunes like the masterful ""It's Only"" agonizingly ambiguous. She wrings layer upon layer of feeling from the wry kiss-off ""Leave Me Now,"" commanding ""never call again"" but later asking ""be the friend I never knew."" The lyrics are equally clever, mixing the lexicon of life science (""Foreign Bodies"") with subtle commentary on relationships and interpersonal interactions. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Bodily Functions'</i> supple texturing, smooth demeanor, and pop songcraft have made it timeless, a gem so well-polished you couldn't ever imagine it accumulating scuff marks. So the reissue acts as more of a reminder than a rediscovery, packaged with a second disc that includes compilation track ""Back to the Start"" (which could have easily landed on the album), as well as a number of period remixes. Highlights include a stunning cover by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2475-jamie-lidell/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie Lidell</a> and strong remixes from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/980-matmos/"" target=""_blank"">Matmos</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3328-plaid/"" target=""_blank"">Plaid</a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For well-versed Herbert fans, the reissue offers few revelations, though it is nice to have the whole period collected into one package. There are a few new bits, however, including a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22157-dave-aju/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Aju</a> remix of ""Foreign Bodies"" and two remixes from <a href=""http://pamparecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pampa</a> boss and consummate weirdo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1201-dj-koze/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Koze</a>. His take on ""You Saw It All"" capitalizes on the album's odd movements and springy textures, but it's his version of ""It's Only"" that really hits home. Koze's work here is pretty transparent: he hollows out the beat and mixes up the vocal, and then puts a monster bassline underneath, sloping down at a sharp right angle just when you expect the chord progression to ascend. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">With <i>Bodily Functions, </i>Herbert made a gorgeous jazz-pop album from recordings of human bodies and a few instruments-- but he also made one of last decade's most important dance albums. An enduring album that still sounds singular, <i>Bodily Functions </i>floats far above the trend-obsessed nature of dance music.</span></p></div>"|17491.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17491-bodily-functions/|8.7|Andrew Ryce

The trickle of new songs to emerge in <i>Armor On</i>'s wake-- the manic yet dreamy ""Wild 'n' Young"", the Michael Bay special effects balladry of ""Pretty Wicked Things"", and the luxuriant art-pop of ""'86"", the first single from her forthcoming debut, <i>GoldenHeart</i>-- casts Dawn as less in tune with the big-chested, neck-snapping attitudes of diva R&amp;B and more like a refugee from a flowery sounds of the late-1980's (think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"" target=""_blank"">Kate Bush</a> circa ""Experiment IV"", or Nona Hendryx's <i>Skin Diver)</i>. The promise and the risk of Dawn's next step, then, is whether and how she can keep rewiring her sonic and stylistic organs while still capturing the emotive power of classic R&amp;B songcraft.</p>
<p><i>Whiteout</i> offers a vision of her potential future. A stopgap for her fans while Dawn finalises a distribution deal for her album, the EP feels like reading a gentle epilogue after having skipped the big climax. This is Dawn in full-on mystic mode, as these four new songs offer variations on a fairly precise idea of ethereal electronic pop. The title track, all sighing harmonies and sonar loops, sees her drift further into pure soundscapes than ever before, but the resulting ""R&amp;B Enya"" effect is more pretty than moving.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the dusty, tremulous drum &amp; bass pop of ""Miles"" closely resembles a lost cut from Madonna's <i>Ray of Light.</i> Previously, Dawn and producer Druski understood the importance of retaining the kinetic power of the beats they adopted; on <i>Whiteout</i>, the breakbeats are simply deployed as a pasty gloss for the winsome synth burbles and sweet vocal refrains. ""Miles"" still works, but it lays bare her aesthetic a little too openly. The constant potential pitfall of genre tourism is spelled out rather more bluntly on the EP's closer, an ""EDM Remix"" of prior single ""December Sky"" that sounds exactly how you'd expect from reading the title.</p>
<p>Happily, then, the remaining two tracks are prime Dawn Richard, although not in the exact manner to which we've grown accustomed. ""And The Bells"" is a hypnotic, mournful ballad that succeeds by accumulation, minor-key melodies and whirring beats and multi-layered vocals weaving in and out of one another to create a building sense of intensity. ""Wynter"" is even better, an unabashed epic built around gently propulsive dubstep rhythms and gorgeous background sample-stuff oddly reminiscent of defunct Scandinavian balearic outfit Air France, but pushed into stellar territory by the tear-jerking contours of the vocal lines.</p>
<p>Hardly less brave or daring in their sonic wanderings, these two standouts nonetheless confirm that Dawn Richard's curiosity and diligence will always be a good look for her, but forging an emotional connection remains the heart of her appeal-- no matter how unadventurous a goal it may seem.</p></div>"|17494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17494-white-out-ep/|6.7|Tim Finney

It's a weird spot for Louie (or, for now, ""King L,"" at least until <a href=""http://www.epicrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Epic Records</a> sorts out some trademark issues with another artist) to be in, not only because of its the tape's nature, but because at this point he doesn't have much in common artistically with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"" target=""_blank"">Chief Keef</a> and most of the other rappers he's commonly mentioned alongside.</p>
<p>While Louie was tied in with the drill scene before anyone outside of Chicago even knew it existed, he's never totally fit in with it. For one, at age 24, he's seven years older than Keef, which in this young scene almost counts as a generational gap. But more importantly, while Keef, his Glory Boys crew, and the ever-growing number of rappers imitating them project the image of dead-eyed sociopaths, Louie's always been a hedonist first and a street tough a far-off second--his long-awaited major label debut's been through at least a year's worth of delays, and it's <i>still</i> called <i>Dope &amp; Shrimp</i>.</p>
<p>As a mixtape released between a rapper landing a deal and the release of his first ""official"" album, <i>Drilluminati</i> is intended to fulfill several important functions. One is to sustain interest in King L between the signing and the arrival of a retail product, which is increasingly difficult to do. The other is to prove that he's ready to make the jump from the mixtape circuit to a much bigger arena. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a>'s shout out to Louie in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46240-listen-kanye-remixes-chief-keef/"" target=""_blank"">his remix of Keef's ""I Don't Like,""</a> which boomed inescapably from car windows and teenagers' cellphones last summer, did the heavy lifting in terms of sustaining interest. But <i>Drilluminati</i> acquits itself nicely in the second respect.</p>
<p>King Louie's been waiting for years to get a chance to establish himself as a rap-world big dog, and on <i>Drilluminati</i> he goes out of his way to invite comparisons with the biggest dog currently running, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>. The fact that he named the opening track ""Rozay Flow"" makes it unmistakable, but its typically supersized operatic beat by Ross mainstays J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League (who also produced the similarly Ross-ish ""Feeling Like a Billion Bucks"") would have been a pretty serious tip-off by itself. And while his lyrics include a fair share of gun talk (although maybe not so much as to justify the grim, bullet-ridden cover art), Louie spends significantly more time assuring us of his aptitude for spending money frivolously, something that Ross proven an Olympian talent for.</p>
<p>Louie seems to understand that, if he's going to make Rick Ross-level paper, it won't be by copying Rick Ross' style-- and he doesn't need to, anyway. His flow has the weird anarchic energy that you used to pick up in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4944-ludacris/"" target=""_blank"">Ludacris</a> verses and, these days, are more likely to find on something featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"" target=""_blank"">2 Chainz</a>. He combines that energy with the clipped, gunfire-like enunciation of a Chicago drill rapper-- and when he finds his pocket, it feels like getting on the right beat at the right time is the only thing between him and pop radio.</p>
<p>A few tracks get partway there. ""My Hoes They Do Drugs"" has verses from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6310-pusha-t/"" target=""_blank"">Pusha T</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"" target=""_blank"">Juicy J</a>, and DJ Pain 1's slo-mo synth psychedelia bears a squinting resemblance to Juicy's ""Bandz a Make Her Dance"", although its single entendre lyrics are maybe too on the nose even for a pop audience. Louie and producer Hearon Trackz work extremely well together on ""My Niggaz"", as Trackz provides a creepy minimalist beat decorated with blaring, <i>Inception</i>-style brass that Louie comes at with what's probably his strongest performance on the album. Even the requisite bedroom song, ""Bandz Up"", featuring an ostentatious hook from the R&amp;B singer Leek, is surprisingly decent.</p>
<p>Things get even more interesting on two songs in particular. ""2 Pair"", produced by Sonny Digital, takes a giddy synth loop and a rap from Louie at his most compellingly louche, and proceeds to pound it into your head and refuses to let up. The track should make listeners either wild out with abandon or dive for the stereo's off switch. And the previously released ""Val Venis"", with its rotund beat by the gifted Chicago producer C-Sick and an instantly memorable, infinitely enjoyable tongue-tying vocal hook, is something out of an A&amp;R's dream. If anything on <i>Dope &amp; Shrimp</i> matches it, Louie might just end up as big as he thinks he is.</p></div>"|17503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17503-drilluminati/|6.8|Miles Raymer

Imagine how strange it must be to head into the studio to record a new full-length, your first in six years, and carry with you the knowledge that there are dozens of newer bands out there aping the exact same kind of songs you're about to commit to tape. Recording a genre-defining classic like <i>Onward to Golgotha</i> early in your career sets the bar pretty high, after all (following it up with the likes of <i>Mortal Throne of the Nazarene</i> and <i>Diabolical Conquest</i> doesn't help!), and some of the younger bands who've been wearing their love for those records on their sleeves do a damn good job of trying to recreate them.</p>
<p>While the more talented purveyors of recent old school death metal have taken what was rapidly becoming an exhausting creative desert of a trend and turned it into the new norm, it's still far too easy to shove a mishmash of slow heavy riffs together, bury it under some audio mud, and declare, ""That'll do!"" There are few things more joyless than sitting down to listen to three soulless, monotonous, self-declared old school death metal records in a row, but with bands as diverse as Cruciamentum, Encoffination, Binah, and Antediluvian flying the flag for murky, darkly melodic metal of death, one's got to wonder: does the world really need a new Incantation album? After listening to <i>Vanquish in Vengeance</i>, I'm pleased to report that the answer is a resounding ""Yes.""</p>
<p>Incantation have never been much for tinkering with their sound or approach. The most pronounced difference on this new album lies in the production. On <i>Vanquish in Vengeance</i>, John McEntee and the lads have abandoned their beloved subterranean squall in favor of a brighter, more open approach. This isn't a squeaky-clean, see-yourself-in-the-riffs-shiny Swedish melodeath record; it's still dark and ugly, but it's not what we're accustomed to hearing from the patron saints of muddy guitar tones. Beyond that minor quibble (or asset, depending on how you like your death metal to sound), the album itself is rock solid.</p>
<p>By now, Incantation don't know how to do anything other than be Incantation, and that's a comforting trait. The macabre, lumbering grooves and aggressive blasts remain intact, as does the hellish din that spews forth from McEntee's tortured throat. Corrupted melodies and a well-oiled rhythm section (anchored by longtime drummer Kyle Severn's murderously precise drumming) keep the songs slithering along smartly.</p>
<p>Incantation are no strangers to the death/doom formula, but in the second act of this performance they really shine a spotlight on the most sluggish end of the spectrum. The first half of the album focuses on the kind of focused, fetid, undeniably evil death metal compositions that we've come to know and love, but title track marks the turning point. Once its twisted chords and churning central riff (lovingly sprinkled with snarling pinch harmonics) fade into ""Profound Loathing"", the tempo shifts, skewing irrevocably towards the lightless depths of doom. The phlegmatic pace of bass-heavy epic ""Profound Loathing"" is a funereal dirge, setting the stage for the latter-era Celtic Frost stomp of ""The Hellions Genesis"" and ""From Hollow Sands"" (whose opening riff is pure Triptykon).</p>
<p>The album closer, ""Legion of Dis,"" stretches past 11 minutes of disemboweled funeral doom, spiking its portentous riffs with shrieks of feedback and McEntee's rumbling, animalistic growls. It unfolds, brutally slowly and with a hangman's grace, prolonging the end until it peters out, offering a shuddering demise narrated by a choir of piercing, noise, bloodcurdling howls, inaudible ranting, and total sonic collapse. It's a barbaric end to an imposing album. By now, Incantation really don't have anything left to prove, but with this latest release, have effortlessly set the bar ever higher for those than come after. </p></div>"|17404.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17404-vanquish-in-vengeance/|7.8|Kim Kelly

The 24-year-old Harlem rapper had a spectacular 2011, snagging a still-crazy $3 million deal with RCA based on early buzz and then silencing skeptics with his breakout <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16026-liveloveaap/"">LiveLoveA$AP</a></i> mixtape. But throughout 2012, <i>LongLiveA$AP</i> repeatedly failed to materialize. It was slated for July 4th, then September 11th, October 31, and eventually, sometime in December. When the final pushback happened, into the dead zone just after the new year, it began to feel like RCA was attempting to quietly jettison their investment from the corporate hull.</p>
<p>But <i>LongLiveA$AP</i> delivers on and even exceeds the promise of <i>LiveLoveA$AP</i>. Like that mixtape, the album is a triumph of craft and curation, preserving Rocky's immaculate taste while smartly upgrading his sound. A third of the record remains close in style to <i>LiveLoveA$AP</i> while most of the collaborations follow in the steps of last spring's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46169-new-aap-rocky-goldie/"">""Goldie""</a>, which stamped producer Hit-Boy's signature <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99xFEm-4I1I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mini-Boss Musik</a> with a screwed-up hook and gumball-spitting flow that marked it as unmistakably Rocky's. Plenty of rap-industry heavies appear on <i>LongLiveA$AP</i>, and they mix well with Rocky's younger comrades. More importantly, the French-braid gold-teeth kid named after Rakim never cedes the center. For someone often criticized for his lack of depth, A$AP Rocky keeps delivering in the face of skepticism.</p>
<p>Even the most dubious ideas succeed on <i>LongLiveA$AP</i>. For example, A$AP Rocky's team-up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a>, ""Wild for the Night"", bombs your cortex with screaming lasers, stadium-sized reverb, and a reggae-derived organ lope, and the beat feels like being on the receiving end of a perfectly executed Tekken chain combo. It seems like it should be impossible to rap over, but Rocky’s sweat-free double-dutch is an easy fit. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27635-santigold/"">Santigold</a> handles the chorus hook on “Hell”, one of two Clams Casino beats on the album, and it feels just as unforced.</p>
<p>A$AP Rocky sounds natural in every setting; along with his command of rhythm and cadence, this is his greatest gift. Whether he's showing off double- and triple-time bounce in the T-Minus-produced ""PMW (All I Really Need)"" or dodging RZA-styled string chops on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48980-listen-aap-rocky-1train-ft-kendrick-lamar-joey-bada-yelawolf-danny-brown-action-bronson-and-big-krit/"">""1 Train""</a> alongside a collision of hot rappers including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"">Action Bronson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28901-big-krit/"">Big K.R.I.T.</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, Rocky sounds utterly at home. Even when he stomps through a queasy Odd Future-style battlefield on “Jodye”, he fully owns the mold. That kind of malleability is crucial to pop stardom, and make no mistake, pop stardom is what Rocky's gunning for. His lyrics, a riot of lifestyle brands and other desirables, can feel like standing in front of a closet of prohibitively expensive designer goods: There isn't much to feel unless you consider ""like three million bucks"" a feeling. But besides the Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors, the Margielas with no laces, the Escada and Balenciaga and Audemars Piguet, there's a lot going on in Rocky's head.</p>
<p>Late-album track ""Suddenly"" bears a co-producing credit from ""Lord Flacko,"" aka <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKXpbkQOglc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rocky himself</a>. In it, a drumless vocal sample fights its way to the surface through layers of aquatic muffling, teasing a titanic beat-drop that keeps not arriving. The song is almost all intro: When the beat finally hits, it only lingers for a few bars before disappearing again. Over this master class in tension and release, Rocky summons childhood memories in calm, expansive strokes: ""Everybody have roaches, but our roaches ain't respect us,"" he cracks, flashing a previously unseen storytelling flair: ""We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fist fights/ And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds/ In one clip, left two down, that's four kids/ But one lived, left three dead but one split/ That one missed, that one snitched."" The song is a forceful reminder of his birthplace and heritage.</p>
<p>Rocky’s New York story has partly been a story of how there is no coherent New York story anymore: Bay Area rappers like the Jacka convincingly channel the gray Queensbridge fatalism of Mobb Deep and Cormega while in Harlem, Rocky soaked up styles happening hundreds of miles away-- Houston screw music, UGK, Bone Thugs. But beneath the 90s-baby trappings, Rocky is a certain breed of Harlem rapper incarnate-- flashy, ambitious, and affably determined to cross over. The flamboyance and singsong rhyme patterns of the Diplomats are an obvious primary color. But reaching further back, to another Harlemite with a deceptively catchy flow, agreeable air, and penchant for colorful clothing, and you find another kindred spirit in Ma$e. Like Ma$e, Rocky tucks steely edges behind a goofy smile. He has the same unerring instinct for balancing pop smarts and street edge and a similar disregard for New York orthodoxy. He’s also consistently dismissed as a lightweight. It's true, Rocky may not be the answer to New York rap's savior complex. But he is undeniably a hit-maker and a major new rap star for a city that sorely needs one. And with <i>LongLiveA$AP</i>, he's beaten expectations twice.</p></div>"|17505.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17505-longliveaap/|8.5|Jayson Greene

The liner notes play up the hip-hop-for-ravers ideal that founders <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5254-a-trak/"" target=""_blank"">A-Trak</a> and Nick Catchdubs have been building up for five years, with an emphasis on the notion that there's room for all kinds of approaches-- ""dungeon ciphers, club shit, BBQ basslines, MPC madness,"" and so on. (This is the label that put out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15753-xxx/"" target=""_blank""><i>XXX</i></a>, so yeah, no kidding.) If you're skeptical about this kind of stuff, this probably won't change your mind; if you're open to it, you've got 22 chances to get your mind blown. Business as usual, right?</p>
<p>But whether or not this label had a hand in upending your own conception of hip-hop orthodoxy, <i>Loosies</i> stands out in its own way. Not just as the summary of a certain boutique-brand view of rap, but a time capsule-worthy rundown of what people argued about and flipped out over in midstream indie-adjacent hip-hop circa 2012. Some people defined their year through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"" target=""_blank"">Juicy J</a>'s inability to say no to ""ratchet pussy""; some through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"" target=""_blank"">El-P</a>'s Scorsese-protagonist urge to find human connections in NYC's more isolated corners. A-Trak pulled them together on the same track, a remix of his ""Piss Test"" that also recruits blunt-force Dipset vet Jim Jones and drugged-out nu-New York phenoms <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30676-flatbush-zombies/"" target=""_blank"">Flatbush Zombies</a>. It's an unlikely alliance, but the point is that they all fit over a beat that proves once and for all that trance synths and trap beats can actually combine into something that could play anywhere.</p>
<p>The other name artists live up to their reps-- good thing, since this comp practically lives and dies by them. Danny Brown's ""Molly Ringwald"" maintains his between-albums profile with an all-in, no-hook tirade with his flow cranked to its most maniacal; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/"" target=""_blank"">AraabMuzik</a>'s beat fittingly streamlines the impact of the superclub pastiche that made him a crossover star. Freeway is preposterously grimy over ""Dedicated""'s vintage soul-- at this point, it sounds like he's got a twin-screw supercharger whirring away inside his voicebox. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30321-party-supplies/"" target=""_blank"">Party Supplies</a> provide a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16425-action-bronson-blue-chips/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blue Chips</i></a>-worthy one-verse wonder in ""Twin Peugeots"", where Daptonian horns underscore French hot-hatch fetishism, kegel-exercise jokes and NBA Jam-era namedrops en route to Rutger Hauer-inspired lunacy (""Blind Fury/hoppin' out the braille Jeep"") and an outro monologue about how he vacationed with your mom ""on a boogie board doin' all types of stunts."" And while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30608-king-l/"" target=""_blank"">King L</a>'s ""Talkin Foolish"" is borderline sociopathic and less capable of converting drill skeptics than ""My Hoes They Do Drugs"" was, at least he seems more interested in channeling his sound through truck speakers instead of Tumblr likes.</p>
<p>That leaves a bunch of up-and-comers and developing cult figures to round out the rest of the collection, and they typically fill one of two roles. The more common one is the contender trying to make headway in an SEO-driven, free-for-all fashion-rap context, staying ephemeral in a safe lane. There's A$AP-shadowing cloud rap (GrandeMarshall's ""Kelly Green""), revivalism that channels 50 through '95 (Troy Ave's ""Viking""), one-size-fits-all half-trap delivered with a murmury, bloodshot deadpan (Problems' ""8 Feet Tall"")-- nothing spectacular, but maybe worth keeping an eye on in case their potential pans out. After a while, <i>Loosies</i> becomes monotonous to the point of oppression, in terms of delivery and subject matter: the pussy/liquor/drugs strain of burnout swag is omnipresent, but isn't outrageous enough to rise above blandly arrogant dick-swinging. So the cuts that break the tedium are priceless, like Casey Veggies having goofy fun over boogie funk on ""Sauna"", Gita delivering a razor-tongued <i>...So Addictive</i> mutation on ""Let That"", and the woozy float of E-40 scion Droop-E's closer ""Mind Gone,"" which is so far above the clouds it's scraping the exosphere.</p>
<p>A-Trak and Catchdubs probably called this collection <i>Loosies</i> for a reason-- like the bodega cigarettes, the piecemeal approach makes more practical sense than springing for the entire pack. (Then again, they did tack on a 70-minute continuous mix of the compilation as an extra track, so they're leaving all the options open.) Uneven as it is, <i>Loosies</i> does a decent job of scraping up some quality material from some of the most buzzed-about artists, letting a handful of unknowns grab at the spotlight, and dropping the occasional early-warning breakthrough when you least expect it. You know you've run across a pretty good comp when you gut half the tracks out of its over-stuffed running time and still have a half-hour's worth that holds together as something worthwhile. Not bad for business as usual.</p></div>"|17506.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17506-loosies/|6.6|Nate Patrin

He <a href=""http://www.ldwt.net/2012/07/don%E2%80%99t-deny-your-heart-hot-chip/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talked</a> of the value in working on musical projects outside his main band during the promo stint for last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16706-in-our-heads/""><i>In Our Heads</i></a>, highlighting how it positively affected the songwriting on that album. Taylor's an enviable musician who gives the impression that he could turn his hand to just about anything if he tried. Even one of his side projects, the low-key collection of musicians who record under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28299-about/"">About Group</a>, have sucked in an impressively broad array of styles over the course of two albums. In 2008 Taylor released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12460-rubbed-out/""><i>Rubbed Out</i></a>, a full-length solo record grazed by rough production values and, on occasion, a C-86-like slackness to the playing. It felt like he was enjoying the deliberate looseness after spending so long on the tightly wound constructions Hot Chip create, and that feeling of shaking off the slightly stuffy studio creations of his main band has become something of a theme to his work elsewhere. Listen closely enough and you may even hear the sound of Taylor pumping air into the studio through a gigantic set of billows.</p>
<p><i>Nayim from the Halfway Line</i> is a further progression for Taylor's work away from Hot Chip. There's nothing here as starkly confessional as ""I Love My Home"" from <i>Rubbed Out</i> or his surprisingly fresh take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"">Paul McCartney</a>'s ""Coming Up"" from the same album. Instead, it's Taylor hopping back and forth over the line he's drawn between Hot Chip and his other output. The sense of organization and efficiency that his other band practices is more present here-- it's less demo-y and spontaneous than either <i>Rubbed Out</i> or About Group. None of the four tracks are soccer-themed, but the title is a nod to the Spanish player Nayim, who scored a spectacular <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsbBSj4vm30"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">goal</a> for Real Zaragoza in the last minute of a match against Arsenal in the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners Cup Final. The ball arcs in the air with just the right weight behind it, Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman is caught off his line, and Nayim achieves immortality from a moment of rare beauty. There's no obvious link between that incident and the music here, but it does further emphasize Taylor's less earnest approach to the presentation of his non-Hot Chip material.</p>
<p>The title lies in stark contrast to the contents inside. There's a familiarly bookish approach to clubland that pervades throughout, matched to the kind of suffocatingly dense production values that make it feel like everything has been labored over a little too long. That doesn't prevent moments of inspiration from arising, it's just that too often they're dragged down by hackneyed devices such as pitch-shifted vocal passages (""Rhodes Dream"") and small loops left to echo into eternity in an attempt at creating ambience (""Jesus' Birthday""). The sense of departure that resonates throughout his other non-Hot Chip work is strangely absent. ""You Want Me"" even sounds like it could've been a track that didn't make the cut on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13908-one-life-stand/""><i>One Life Stand</i></a>, although that's not necessarily a bad place to be, especially when Taylor glides into a smooth synth odyssey in its final third. It feels like a step back to the kind of improvisation that lit up his other work away from his main band, momentarily returning to the sense of freedom and release entrenched in those recordings.</p>
<p>The overriding feeling of this EP is one of finding a home for loose ideas that had been hanging around for a while. It's too bad Taylor couldn't find more room for his reedy, utterly soulful vocal passages, such as the ones that briefly light up ""Hot Squash"". He's got the kind of voice that can easily transcend the trite sentimentality that sometimes infects his writing. On ""Hot Squash"" he can even get away with singing: ""Years I've been waiting, waiting too long/ years I've been waiting, now you've gone."" Imbuing lines like that with palpable emotion and setting them to tight pop structures are Taylor's forte, it's just that here they tail off into squawking wah-wah guitar and redundant analog synth bloops, leaving this EP caught somewhere between genuine inspiration and a mess of fumbling in the dark. Similarly, Nayim's titular goal could be argued over as a piece of supreme skill and judgement or a blind hit-and-hope moment. Here, the latter just about wins out over the former.</p></div>"|17488.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17488-nayim-from-the-halfway-line/|6.3|Nick Neyland

Last year, he gave away <i>The Teac Life</i>, an album longer and almost exactly as good as <i>The Paranormal Soul</i>, for free. Danny Wolfers' output is vast, so I'll let him <a href=""http://www.junodownload.com/plus/2012/12/17/renegade-of-a-new-age-an-interview-with-legowelt/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sum it up</a>: ""[P]eople like melodies, so why not make them?"" The album's seamless blend of dance paradigms-- house, techno, electro-- mean that the melodies, which Legowelt draws into orbit out of mostly vintage gear, are on full display.</p>
<p>Despite the commitment to analog equipment, Legowelt doesn't make vintage music. Wolfers' sound is explicitly modern, in that it's not just the product of someone using Juno synthesizers and TR drum machines; it's the product of someone who has developed a time-tested mastery over them, who has benefitted from the learning of others. <i>The Paranormal Soul</i> is so seamless, so clean and wizard-ly that it illuminates the paradox at the center of Legowelt's work. He releases so much material, through so many outlets, that all the negative connotations of machine music start to bubble up: generative, automatic, easy. On the other hand, Legowelt's recordings are masterful, and his arrangements are more complex than those of (many of) his peers. If what Legowelt does is easy, everyone would sound as good as he does.</p>
<p>Legowelt's recordings weren't always this way. At the beginning of the last decade, his tracks were comprised of short, staccato bursts of sound. His lone recording for Germany's Cocoon label, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEXoCcxwH4Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Disco Rout""</a>, was a dance hit in 2002. This is, presumably, where Legowelt acquired the ""lo-fi house"" tag that continues to stick to him to this day. It's a red herring now, as Legowelt has grown more skillful, to the point where listening to <i>Soul</i> can be like reading a letter from someone with exquisite penmanship. A long letter: <i>Soul</i> clocks in at over an hour, chock full of five- and six-minute blasts of warm bass and tip-toeing sequencers. It is the other side of the coin that is Legowelt's amazing productivity: he's a shitty self-editor, or at least he has no interest in being a good one.</p>
<p>Tracks like the anthemic ""I Only Move for U"" or the cinematic ""Transformation of the Universe"" would drop like bombs as 12""s, but they get lost in the thicket of synthesizers. The 12 tracks on <i>Soul</i> have similar tempos, tone, and duration; Legowelt pulls off the difficult feat of numbing the listener with quality, of obscuring his personality with his craft. <i>The Teac Life</i> traded on this effect for its hazy, forested atmosphere. <i>Soul</i> is clearer, more of a party album-- see those jackin' vocal samples on ""Clap Yo Hands"" or the acid that bubbles over during ""Voice of Triumph""-- so it can't skate by on obscurity.</p>
<p>And it doesn't, for the most part. If <i>Soul</i> somehow feels like less than the sum of its parts, that doesn't detract that the parts themselves are shiny, sleek little things. Tracks like ""Rave Till Dawn"" and ""Renegade of a New Age"" are fully formed bangers. Legowelt creates limber, beautiful dance music even if he's a little clumsy when it comes to creating limber, beautiful dance albums. This is probably the price you pay to wrap yourself in craft and process; it's doubtful Legowelt thinks much of it.</p></div>"|17483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17483-the-paranormal-soul/|6.9|Andrew Gaerig

Those tapes, first passed around among southside high-schoolers, were what landed the now-17-year-old rapper his Interscope deal, and apart from a few random A&amp;R'ed guest spots, the label appears to have stayed out of his way.</p>
<p>That's a good thing. Chief Keef's music sparked a lot of arguments this year. His youth, his rapid rise, and his association with Chicago's epidemic of gun violence made him 2012’s flashpoint for discussions about what was wrong with hip-hop. But he established a simple sound that proved powerfully effective and addictive, and he also showed that it was a sturdy enough blueprint to support multiple songs. If Waka Flocka Flame woke up tomorrow utterly drained of the will to live, he might sound like Chief Keef -- all the unilateral forward motion and aggression, none of the audible joy. Young Chop's crisp snares and hi-hats mimic Lex Luger's (minus the tricky syncopation) while Keef mutters through a thick wall of processing.</p>
<p>There's nothing to add or subtract to this sound that could substantially improve it. Fellow Chicagoan Kanye West found that out the hard way when his <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnificent_Mile"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michigan Avenue</a> makeover of ""I Don't Like"" was given a public<a href=""http://idolator.com/6422392/kanye-west-i-dont-like-producer-feud"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> dressing-down</a> by Young Chop the day after it hit the web. <i>Finally Rich</i> benefits from some professional tweaks in the mix, but otherwise leaves Keef's sound untouched. And in addition to succeeding on its own terms, it proves that Keef has a lot of potential-- much more than his detractors might have hoped.</p>
<p>Based on a simple four-note earworm, the hook on album opener ""Love Sosa"" has the feel of something sung under the breath, and after hearing it once or twice, you'll probably find yourself doing just that. There's an unquantifiable line separating the maddeningly catchy from the simply maddening, and Keef has a natural knack for walking it. ""Hallelujah"", also produced by Young Chop, is one the album's more involved productions: Its blaring horns gesture towards Waka's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Let's_Do_It"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""O Let's Do It""</a> over Hammond organ licks that feel smuggled out of Houston rap. ""Diamonds"" has a similar feel, with gunfire, horn and string stabs, and a manic carnival-ride synth line all rolling out like evenly spaced 8-bit Donkey Kong barrels.</p>
<p>""Hate Bein' Sober"", the album’s forthcoming single, is the catchiest moment and perhaps the most pop-focused song Keef’s ever made. It features 50 Cent, who sounds at home for the first time on a pop-rap hit since ""I Get Money"". Out of the handful of big names on <i>Finally Rich</i>, 50's appearance makes the most intuitive sense: Keef built his mystique, in part, on the idea that he was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16497-back-from-the-dead/"" target=""_blank"">back from the dead</a>, and 50 was the first rapper to overtly sell himself as an unkillable Terminator-like figure. His patented sing-song sloganeering sounds current again here, maybe because <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</i> came out when Keef was in elementary school and is part of his basic musical vocabulary.</p>
<p>Speaking of which: Chief Keef isn’t a lyricist. At all. His lyrics on <i>Finally Rich</i> are almost entirely composed of rudimentary gangsta-rap boilerplate, which he treats more like a graffiti bomber than a rapper, tagging his beats with slogans meant for maximum impact and minimal scrutiny. If there’s anything the odd jumble of industry rappers who show up on <i>Finally Rich</i> share, it’s this casual approach to lyrics. French Montana, who pops up on ""Diamonds"", is most famous thus far for <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/magazine/lady-mondegreen-and-the-miracle-of-misheard-song-lyrics.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>literally inventing a word he didn't even say</i></a>. And Wiz Khalifa fails to make an impression (as usual) when he drops in on ""Hate Bein' Sober"".</p>
<p>Some of the material filling out <i>Finally Rich</i> is already a year old, including the ubiquitous ""I Don't Like"" and another of Keef's earliest YouTube hits, ""3Hunna"", which now sports a Rick Ross feature. The album feels, promisingly, like a progress report on Keef's developing voice rather than a forced ""arrival."" This has downsides, as there are amateurish moments where some intervention might have been welcome: ""No Tomorrow""'s  vocals barely match up with the beat, while ""Laughin to the Bank"" takes a bassy ""HAWH HAWH HAWH"" vocal hook and flogs you into submission with it. It feels specifically designed to make older rap fans massage their temples.</p>
<p>But there are also hints of where Keef’s sound could go next: ""Kay Kay"", produced by K.E. On The Track, is gentle and pretty, built from rolling piano and airy synths. And ""Citgo"" is as close to an uplifting song as Keef’s ever written. Produced by Young Ravisu, it floats on new age synths while Keef sings a warm, sweet melody. The lyrics are still riddled with violence, but the ugliness of the sentiments don't survive the sunlight of song's major key. It's not a <i>redemptive</i> moment, exactly, but it is a transformative one. ""[My sister] thought I was going to be some kind of motherfuckin' screw-up or something,"" Keef says on the intro to ""Ballin"", in a clip taken from an interview. ""They thought I was going to be like, bad all my life…I gotta job now, I gotta daughter too."" On an album single-mindedly devoted to painting Keef as pitiless and cold, it’s a brief glint of the dimensions this ruthlessly effective album barely touches on.</p></div>"|17477.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17477-finally-rich/|7.5|Jayson Greene

He started out as a baby-faced turntablist savant who won the most prestigious DJ competition in the world before he could legally drive a car. After that came the <i>Sunglasses Is a Must</i> era, where he left the insular world of turntablism for a gig as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye's</a> tour DJ, and to figure out how to incorporate his hip-hop-derived skills into the emergent post-indie dance music culture. We are now well into phase three, where he established himself as a legitimate EDM heavyweight with at least one certified rave anthem (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/40207-video-duck-sauce-barbra-streisand/"" target=""_blank"">""Barbra Streisand""</a>, which he recorded with Armand Van Helden under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28340-duck-sauce/"" target=""_blank"">Duck Sauce</a>) under his belt, as well as an eye for talent that's made Fool's Gold, the label he runs with the DJ/producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7639-nick-catchdubs/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Catchdubs</a>, one of the most influential indies in the music business.</p>
<p>Phase-three <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5254-a-trak/"" target=""_blank"">A-Trak</a> is not only the most successful of his incarnations but also by far the funnest. The turntablist scene he came up in has a marked tendency to emphasize technical chops over pleasure, but over the years he's evolved into a full-on hedonist who's not afraid to skirt the line of what some might call cheesiness, and has fully embraced the place in arena-filling quasi-mainstream EDM culture that ""Barbra Streisand"" helped earn him.</p>
<p>After years of near-constant gigging in nearly every shape and size of venue imaginable, Macklovitch has developed a very clear idea of what qualities a song needs to move a crowd, and his new four-song EP is definitely intended to put that knowledge to work producing yet another signature track capable of making tens of thousands of people lose their shit at the same time.</p>
<p>It's possible that either ""Jumbo"" or ""Disco Nap"" could end up being that track. The former, produced with the Swedish EDM supergroup Galantis, has a frenetic, 90s-cyberpunk feel, and enough tweaky rhythmic breakdowns to appeal to an audience predisposed to dubstep. The latter, a collaboration with LA DJ duo Oliver, offers a popping electro-funk groove, acid-house-style buildups, and a vocal hook that pays tribute to the popular and highly recommended practice of getting a nap in before going clubbing.</p>
<p>But odds are it'll be either ""Tuna Melt"" or ""Landline"" that becomes the kind of inescapable song that’ll show up in every set of a multiple-DJ bill without anyone in the crowd complaining. Both are precisely engineered to move bodies, to the point where it almost feels manipulative and unfair, as if you barely have a choice in the matter. Aspiring dance music producers should consider drawing out diagrams for their structures to learn where to add sounds, where to take them away, when to switch the tone of the synth playing the lead melody, and other essential qualities that a rave anthem needs.</p>
<p>""Landline"", a collaboration with the producer GTA, has several lessons to impart, including how one can manipulate a retro sound like a booming 90s-style synth piano using modern ideas such as the glitchy clusters of notes popular with trap music producers, or where to shift the gears on the tempo from half-time to double-time (and where to shift back), as well as the potential of a ridiculous sample (in this case of Woody Woodpecker's laugh) to push a song well over the edge of sanity.</p>
<p>""Tuna Melt"" is as immaculately and meticulously crafted as one of his DMC-winning turntablism sets. There isn't a superfluous sound in its nearly six minute span, nothing-- from the stunningly simple but inescapable main riff to the chopped-up, diva-style female vocal sample-- that doesn't have a clear role in motivating the listener to dance. It has the ruthlessly efficient grace of an <i>Alien</i> xenomorph, and it doesn't require any chemical assistance to move an EDM fan to a place of total rave bliss. I suspect Macklovich won't have to write another arena-sized anthem for at least a few more years.</p></div>"|17487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17487-tuna-melt-ep/|7.5|Miles Raymer

It just wasn't as risky as it might have been a couple years before: there was already a thick, smothering atmosphere building in the air that made Starkey's eclectic approach seem like a cerebral sort of outlier when it dropped.</p>
<p>Two months later, Sonny Moore posted his electro-dabbler alter ego's debut EP <i>My Name Is Skrillex </i>to MySpace, and by the end of the year the parameters for what constituted a Stateside take on dubstep had drastically shifted to a monolithic wave of WUB WUB SICK DROPZ. When this stuff started filling arenas, the mainstream media decided the development was worth kicking a decade's worth of history to the curb for, and a nuanced, creatively diverse, long-evolving genre was reduced almost overnight into one-dimensional meme fodder by rockist blogs and YouTube joke-mongers. It's enough to turn musical progressives into gate-slamming reactionaries.</p>
<p>To his credit, Starkey's own reaction to all this seems to be more of a brief side eye before getting back to the business of refining his own thing. <i>Ear Drums and Black Holes </i>was entertaining if somewhat uneven, not necessarily quality-wise but in outlook-- a bunch of ideas too good for the singles-plus-filler designation, but with a sprawl that pulled focus away from a real pivotal stylistic center. His new one,<i> Orbits</i>, manages to draw all his influences together into something more consistent, an actual streamlined signature sound that makes perfect sense given the records that preceded it. Like his 2008 Planet Mu debut album <i>Ephemeral Exhibits</i> and most of the singles and EPs that led up to it, he's made this album a one-man operation without collaborative efforts or vocal guest spots. So its idiosyncracies and surprises are all his, and there's a more direct route to getting a grasp on what he's been going for all this time, even if there's still no shortage of cross-genre leaps and well-timed mood swings.</p>
<p>It helps that dubstep is only part of his music's DNA-- enough that it fits under a liberal definition of the genre, but not so much that he's tied down to its preconceived notions. Much of <i>Orbits </i>owes its sound to an engagement with longstanding influences; this is an artist who sounds the way he does because, as a DJ, he knows his way around what makes the foundational likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17191-terror-danjah/"" target=""_blank"">Terror Danjah</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23408-plastician/"" target=""_blank"">Plastician</a> tick and translates that through his own filters. But there are also multiple stabs at working with trap and footwork rhythms, whether they're straight-up or salvaged for parts-- largely the latter, twisted out of shape in cuts like the jostling space-Luger overload of ""G V Star (Part 2)"" or the fractured juke of ""Thugs"". There are brief, contemplative ambient interludes (""G V Star (Part 1)"") and moments of Vangelis-style classic-synth grandeur (""Crashing Sphere""). There's even a nod to trance in the closer, ""Distant Star"", that breathtakingly pits that genre's simple chords and 4/4 throb against Starkey's drive to make things more rhythmically and melodically slippery. That track then slams the door with a big shameless stadium-sized dubstep wobble out of nowhere before the fadeout, but it might scan more like a snarky joke instead of a fitting coda if it didn't have a well-thought-out snare-rattle/clap beat bristling underneath.</p>
<p>That whiplash transition isn't a fluke, either-- in almost every track, there's some weird rhythmic structural curveball that upends the typical expectations of buildups and breakdowns and throws in new elements almost as an ambush. Where other songs ratchet up to a huge drop, he pulls the rug out and inverts the equation so elements disperse instead of explode. Here, ramping up to the isolation of an odd little melodic flourish like the ones in ""The Shuttle"" and ""Lzr"" has every bit the resonance as the wig-pushing bass explosions these songs eventually swing back to. And while the slow build from jittery, drumless melodies and vocal samples to a succession of door-kick basslines and starcruiser-liftoff synths in the anthemic ""Command"" is Make The Crowd Go Apeshit 101, it's just as impactful when the speaker-rattling elements dissipate halfway through to let the moody melodic bits breathe again. Because of the way Starkey deploys his moments of hopped-up but measured-out clamor over intricate rhythms that are actually slower than they might first seem, it all works on both the visceral hands-up level you get from big bass blowouts and the slow-ride zone-out level that lets listeners really sink into a beat.</p>
<p>Which is a roundabout way of leading up to the fact that Starkey can get away with all this because his music's so emotionally evocative, even when it's wordless. (That's most of the time, though the judicious usage of his own Auto-Tuned voice on ""Magnet""-- ""frequency is lost/ take one last breath""-- is too haunting to be cloying.) He's skilled at drawing out catharsis and release through those very structures he messes with, where even the most frenetic melodies linger in the mind afterwards; it's best heard in ""Thugs"", which piles bass rattle after percussive fusillade after vocal-sample tic on top of the simple, melancholy melodic figure it opens on but never actually overwhelms it or drowns it out. And he's not afraid to build hooks out of sounds that are annoying the first few times and catchy from there on out, like the weird plink/twang melody on ""G V Star (Part 2)"" that sounds like it's sourced from the foley of a tooth being yanked out in a 50s cartoon. This is some outlandish stuff, to be sure, but in a sense-of-adventure kind of way that feels in keeping with the vague, in-title-only themes of futurism and space travel that <i>Orbits </i>centers around. There are probably more uncharted worlds out there than we think, and Starkey seems hellbent on finding all of them.</p></div>"|17471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17471-orbits/|8.0|Nate Patrin

First, the story. Sigha, London native James Shaw, began making vaguely tech-y dubstep for <a href=""http://www.hotflushrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hotflush</a> and other labels around the turn of the decade; he has since moved to Berlin and proceeded to make a more traditional form of techno. He runs the nascent <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/ourcirculasound"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Our Circula Sound</a> label. Though he rarely sits down for interviews or offers podcasts, he is not reclusive or secretive, just busy and thoughtful. If you wanted an avatar for the Modern European Underground Dance Artist, you could do a lot worse.</p>
<p>Sigha's music, especially what he offers on his debut album <i>Living With Ghosts</i>, is also hookless in a musical sense. He favors the unforgiving, all-rhythm-everything approach of certain second wave Detroit artists as well as the more modern crop of German enthusiasts. Sigha once professed that he finds big melodies distracting, so you can be sure what you're getting throughout <i>Ghosts</i>: linear, mainline drum machines riding roughshod over hissy electronic ephemera. Softness arrives in pill-sized doses, small squiggles of color repeatedly snuffed out by the drums and the haze. Beatless passages tar the beginning, middle, and end of <i>Ghosts</i>, because full-lengths require Art. Sigha's ties to bass music shine through in the tempos, which sit in the 120s. It's big music, meant for big spaces: <i>Ghosts</i> doesn't sound bad on headphones, but it's not any fun, either. Small, personal environments trivialize tracks this rigid. When played loudly, <i>Ghosts</i> commandeers its space. Its synths groan, its drums bulldoze, the whole album intrudes and menaces.</p>
<p><i>Ghosts</i> is industrial in the most literal sense: the tracks show up, perform, and then exit. There are no hissing valves, no rusty scrapes, no brokedown palaces full of empty assembly lines. <i>Ghosts</i> is too put together for that; it is the modern factory, steam-cleaned every evening, proper safety equipment. Sterility is implied, and when <i>Ghosts</i> errs it errs on the side of order and caution. It is dense and noisy, but it's also conservative, especially because, even for gritty techno, <i>Ghosts</i> is not funky or sexy (don't let the cover fool you). It is pummeling introspection, ""peak time"" interpreted as the point in the evening during which you have most forgotten where you are.</p>
<p>If this were philosophy you would accuse Sigha of asceticism; it's techno, so we just say ""bleak,"" and ""uncompromising."" There's nothing easy about making music this relentless and impersonal. It is masochism dressed up as genre. (An early Sigha single was named ""I Am Apathy, I Am Submission"".) In open air, Sigha's systems are chaotic and threatening, but they have a habit of choking one another off over the course of an album. <i>Ghosts</i> still proves, though, over and over, that Sigha has a single, awesome skill-- tunneling, perverse techno.</p></div>"|17421.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17421-living-with-ghosts/|6.8|Andrew Gaerig

The Perth, Australia, trio are post-punk primitivists, playing one-minute songs built from single-note guitar riffs, shoes-in-the-dryer drum beats, and deadpan vocals that relate, with varying degrees of disinterest, the details of bad dates, hot days, and naps. Sloppy, unpolished, and completely undeterred by their lack of chops, had they showed up 30 years earlier, Taco Leg would have made a cozy addition to a <a href=""http://www.hyped2death.com/messtheticsisms.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Messthetics</a> comp. The band's self-titled debut LP is not unlikeable, though. Ambling through 12 songs in just under 20 minutes, it's a document of deep and devoted slacker-ism.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Melbourne punks, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28433-eddy-current-suppression-ring/"" target=""_blank"">Eddy Current Suppression Ring</a>, Taco Leg's songs swap out political commentary, youth angst, and self-examination for lyrics devoted to banal, workaday befuddlement. Eddy Current played tense, minimalist music, but sidestepped aggro rock clichés by singing about eating ice cream, wake up calls, and color television. Taco Leg skews a little wackier in their choice of prose. ""Saw the ball/ It was coming/ Cracked my whip under the door,"" yelps singer, Andrew Murray. If you had any lingering doubts about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14502-raider/"" target=""_blank"">the song's</a> inspiration, he clears them up during the chorus, shouting, ""<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>."" On ""Find Me"", Murray sings about playing hide and seek and ""Hot One"" finds him listing ways to beat the heat. Meanwhile, the rhythm section plugs away with the zeal of some nervous after-school rock camp first-timers.</p>
<p>Rather than shield their wobbly riffs in sheets of distortion and grit, Taco Leg fess up, delivering clear and crisp recordings of their shambolic tunes. A little more fuzz might have helped. It's not a lack of chops that holds Taco Leg back, but their inability to let loose. The recordings sound stripped down and live, like they were put straight to tape in a basement, but most of the time the band comes off like they're looking at their sneakers. Each muddled, mid-tempo, surf-rock riff slips anonymously into the next. Whether they've adopted a rigorous, anti-careerist ideology or just can't play guitar very well, Taco Leg's refusal or inability to step on the gas is a drag after a while. But there's a purity in their goofball noodling. Taco Leg play what they know, as enthusiastically as they are capable, even if that's only three ragged notes.</p></div>"|17423.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17423-taco-leg/|6.0|Aaron Leitko

He is not a rapper's rapper, but he helped push rap into its current fixation with doing drugs instead of selling them and has rightfully reaped the rewards of an entire genre following his lead. He also became a pop star with ease in 2010, sliding into the studio with pop titans like Stargate and Benny Blanco and emerging with a No. 1 single (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UePtoxDhJSw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Black and Yellow""</a>) that was a pure rap banger and another pop smash (""Roll Up"") that applied his airy, breezy aesthetic to the radio. <i>O.N.I.F.C.</i>, his second major label album, is a resounding misstep, and it's the first sign that Khalifa's unwavering focus may be getting swallowed up by the haze.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Or maybe he couldn't bring himself to care about the fragile nature of crossover success any longer. <i>O.N.I.F.C. </i>will quickly be swept under the rug by anyone but his true diehards, yet Khalifa still had a successful year by displaying his malleability. His <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16434-taylor-allderdice/"" target=""_blank""><i>Taylor Allderdice </i></a>mixtape from March was a nice stopgap release, steeped in the same foggy, washed out beats that helped elevate him to fame. <i>Cabin Fever 2</i>, from October, saw Khalifa dipping into L.A.'s ratchet scene to show just how much artists like Iamsu! owe to his own mix of nonsense rapping and soft, blissed-out singing. Both mixtapes were right in his lane, and they predicted the direction Khalifa would take with the album proper.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Khalifa has already more or less disowned his debut, telling his fans that ""creatively [it] wasn't my best work."" That regret is evident on <i>O.N.I.F.C. </i>which tosses a Blanco produced single to the dogs but then retracts further into his vaporized aesthetic. The album kicks off with a suite of tracks that are meant to wash over you, and they are undoubtedly effective-- ""Paperbond"" is steeped in the comforting draft of chillwave while ""Bluffin'"", produced by Drumma Boy no less, borders on balearic. The problem, though, is that both songs would work best as zone-out instrumentals. Khalifa doesn't say anything of note-- ""riding in my ride"" is crushingly emblematic -- and doesn't sound particular good from a technical standpoint. He is there because he has to be, not because he should be.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Everything from there on is just an unending succession of diminishing returns that questions the relevancy of Khalifa's artistic existence. He could-- and just may-- pump music out for the indefinite future that coasts on sound design and little else. Wiz has never exactly spit quotable 16s but his rapping on <i>O.N.I.F.C. </i>suggests ignorance regarding his own distance instead of a conscious desire to roll with the vibes. The album's acronym stands for ""Only Nigga in First Class"" and sports a dour looking photo of Khalifa on the cover, but it's difficult to find any significance in either-- he hints at fatigue, but doesn't illuminate the flipside of stardom in any way. </p>
<p class=""p2"">Maybe the album's most indicative track is ""No Limit"", which is nearly nine and a half minutes long thanks to a three-minute instrumental interlude. It sounds pointless except that the interlude is easily the most enjoyable moment of the record. After a verse from Wiz, the song slips into beachside ambience, ice-rattle drums, and plaintive pianos. It is legitimately as good as anything <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12663-air-france/"" target=""_blank"">Air France</a> ever did. Then Wiz starts rapping again.</p></div>"|17391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17391-onifc/|4.8|Jordan Sargent

At this point we generally know what we're in for when mention is made of the late singer-- some haphazard reappropriation of a vocal track or Timbaland beat, the trademark baby coos of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuWMW7hVdTs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Are You That Somebody?""</a> buried behind layers of echo or slapped onto somone else's production. But Katy flips expectations here by creating a song that sounds nothing like an Aaliyah original, instead paying homage by making her the subject of the track's lyrics. ""Aaliyah, please-- this is green envy/ Why must you taunt me, girl?,"" she sings over a bass rhythm. Katy trades lines seamlessly with guest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"" target=""_blank"">Jessie Ware</a>, another UK breakout vocalist, crafting a lyrical love triangle that gazes at Aaliyah from a brand new angle. Together the singers take low-hanging fruit and make something complex from it.</p>
<p>Ware joins a stacked lineup of collaborators on the four-song <i>Danger</i> EP that also includes producers Diplo, Jacques Greene, Geeneus, and Zinc, along with rappers Iggy Azalea and Wiley. Which could have very easily made for a crowded, linkbait-laden mess of an EP under another artist's jurisdiction (see: Charli XCX’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17457-super-ultra/"" target=""_blank""><i>Super Ultra</i></a> EP), but Katy B proves herself an excellent curator. <i>Danger</i>'s a collective effort that's diverse but never motley, warm never weak, tough but never harsh, slick but never washed out. While Katy's the centerpiece of the release, she's also an expert chameleon who bends to accommodate her collaborators without sacrificing her vision of gentle UK bass-bred club music. She invites them to see things her way.</p>
<p>On paper, the easy weak link appears to be ""Light as a Feather"", which pairs Diplo's ""Set It Off"" beat with notorious Australian rap robo-doll Iggy Azalea. It's a recipe for a capital-A annoying song, but Iggy makes what might be her least grating showing ever, adding a brief and subdued verse before passing the buck back to Katy. ""Show me your wild side/ I'll be your Vegas/ Don't hold back/ It's yours for the <i>taking</i>,"" she raps, just as Katy swoops in and cleverly lifts the word ""take"" for her own part. ""What does it <i>take</i>/ To make you feel/ To get you excited/ To see you smile?,"" she asks as the soft synth fizz percolates.</p>
<p>As she did with <i>On a Mission</i>, Katy B uses the <i>Danger</i> EP to explore a softer, more forlorn aspect of nightlife, braiding the nuances of parties and relationships together. ""Yeah you passed my love to the left-hand side/ Smoked it right down to the roach/ So I might as well put it out,"" she sings on the slinky Jacques Greene-produced ballad ""Danger"". She and Drake might get along well. But the message is clearest on Friday-night anthem ""Got Paid"": ""Straight to the floor/ I let the beat mend my broken heart."" Katy never sulks for long.</p>
<p>Dropped out of the blue in the year's mid-December deadzone, <i>Danger</i> is another triumph of the EP-length release. Some of the year's best music-- Dum Dum Girls' <i>End of Daze</i>, TNGHT's self-titled debut, and Solange Knowles' new record <i>True</i>-- has been released in the brief, punchy form, and now we can add <i>Danger</i> to that list. In Katy's case, it serves several important purposes: It's a placeholder that reminds us of her existence and shows us she's established some exciting collaborative relationships since <i>On a Mission</i>. It gives us a sparkling peek into what she might have lined up for her scheduled full-length next year. Most of all, it just makes us want to dance.</p></div>"|17493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17493-danger-ep/|7.8|Carrie Battan

In some cases the work of rapping comes secondary to the work of selling the rapper. I'll never forget Ghostface's mercenary stage banter at 2008's Pitchfork Music Festival: ""Chicago's one of our biggest markets!"" Atlanta's Rich Kidz, who make a flamboyant hybrid of R&amp;B and goon-rap, are so steeped in the art of business that they're half-removed from the business of art. ""I got no purpose,"" Skool Boi raps on <i>Straight Like That 3</i>'s ""Kool on the Low."" ""I go rock out these shows/ And fuck these hoes for good promotion."" Whether or not he's ""good"" at sex or even enjoys it is somehow irrelevant. In Rich Kidz' world, sex is networking and horizontal integration isn't just a management strategy but a double entendre. </p>
<p>Compared to February's <i>Everybody Eat Bread</i>, <i>STL3 </i>rests more heavily on rap, which is too bad for a few reasons, primarily that they aren't great rappers and that their ability to incorporate straight-up R&amp;B is what made songs like ""My Life"" so ""I See You"" so great to begin with. Like any good salesmen they put their best material out front. If you would like to understand what this group does well quickly, there's ""Ms. Do It All"", a song with a sharp hook, simple lyrics, the tempo of a ballad, and the heft of a battle march. (The song was produced by DJ Spinz, now-famous for Ca$h Out's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9mfuifkZgc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cashin Out""</a>.) Whether the song's central image-- the woman that can (and does) do it all-- is supposed to praise women or put them down is anyone's guess. In some ways, Rich Kidz are like modern-day versions of the 19th-century English dandies: straight men who are obsessed with their own appearances, alternately condescending and reverent toward women, and aspiring to aristocracy even though they were born somewhere much lower.   </p>
<p>""The female question"" gets some unfortunate answers on ""Housewife"", ""Fantasy"", and ""AC Coolin'."" Part of what makes Rich Kidz endearing is that it's difficult to imagine them actually being assholes-- they act hard on tape because they feel like they need to to sell records. In the long run, it's possible that they don't, but the culture they're coming from-- as <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/t-magazine/in-atlanta-where-hip-hop-meets-strip-clubs.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">written about recently</a> by Jon Caramanica in the <i>New York Times</i>' <i>T Magazine</i>-- is one with what seem like pretty localized standards of morality. In any case, it's a look that seems uncomfortable on them-- and ultimately less interesting than the one they assume on ""Ms. Do It All"" anyhow, regardless of whatever vague demographic <i>that</i> song is aimed for.  </p>
<p>Things pick up toward the end. The Future collaboration ""Back It Up"" works pretty well in part because it's delightful to hear Future's creepily insistent robot voices next to Kaelub and Skool Boi's still rapping like they sort of can't believe they're actually on the microphone. Future also offers the tape's saddest lyric, and maybe the one most specific to Rich Kidz' world: ""We can't save her, so we pay for her."" </p>
<p>Rich Kidz aren't great rappers, but they are great salesmen, and like great salesman, what they sell isn't as important as the confidence with which they sell it. ""Check out my ice, I'm so icy!,"" ""We go lingo crazy!,"" ""I got to clean out the garage later/ now we can fuck in the garage, baby!,"" and my personal favorite, ""It's pajama time!""-- these are lines that other writers might cut but that Rich Kidz deliver with an enthusiasm so shameless the burden to reject them falls entirely on the listener. In short, they are charming as hell, or at least can be. Over the summer, they signed to Columbia Records, a move that could either stifle what seems like a productive independent career or foster it. That <i>STL3</i> is spotty is fine in part because it's free. This is a strategy any salesman understands: Hook them with the right sample and you'll have them for life. </p></div>"|17475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17475-straight-like-that-3/|6.0|Mike Powell

The reissue was a nice reminder of the peculiar magic Morley conjures with thick guitar, monotone vocals, and the occasional beat. At its best, such as in the two-chord, 12-minute epic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6HnGxLAvPI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Have Not""</a>, <i>The Dew Line </i>offered noise-rock slowed to a crawl and coated in syrup, as if Morley recorded it in a codeine-induced haze. Stretching riffs into drones that still maintained a rock thrust, he made lethargy hypnotic.</p>
<p>After <i>The Dew Line</i>, Morley has veered mostly toward computer-based music, incorporating samples and even some dance beats. The overall effect of the sound has been similar to that of his early work, mostly due to his mesmerizingly sluggish singing. But certainly some Gate fans must have wondered if he would revisit the heavy-fuzz style that made mid-90s records like <i>The Dew Line, Guitar, </i>and <i>Golden </i>so compelling (and such worthy companions to his work in New Zealand trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5096-the-dead-c/"">the Dead C</a>.)</p>
<p><i>Damned Revolutions</i>, the first Gate LP since 2010's beat-driven <i><a href=""http://www.midheaven.com/item/republic-of-sadness-by-gate-lp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Republic of Sadness</a></i>, is a clear return to that sound, and a triumphant one. Triumphant is perhaps an odd word to use for music this subdued and uninterested in hurrying to get anywhere. But <i>Damned Revolutions</i>' slo-mo moans and room-filling guitar are bold, persistent, and once again hypnotic. There's no hesitancy in these two side-long, 19-minute pieces. It's all confident, purposeful time-expansion, with no big moves or flashy changes needed to hold attention.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that nothing happens on <i>Damned Revolutions</i>. It's actually a pretty busy record at times, with Morley cranking out extended guitar noise that rivals his farthest-out explorations in the Dead C. But even those moments stretch time more then they mark it. The tick of the clock seems to fade away as Morley's pieces progress. That approach encourages you to get inside each sound without worrying about when it will end, and to absorb each moment fully rather than anticipate the next one.</p>
<p>The two halves of <i>Damned Revolutions </i>take different angles to achieve this effect. On ""Turned And Glowing Inwardly"", Morley actually does mark time with a sparse, insistent pulse. But the more it marches on, the more it melts into his fog of vocals and guitar. Gradually, its robotic regularly starts to feel surreal and illusively lopsided, as if the woozy sound surrounding it were contagiously throwing it off.</p>
<p>Beats are absent on ""Turning and Towards the Light"", a dark guitar improvisation filled with churning, distant chords. But instead of feeling scary or melodramatic, the track exudes a thorough, almost eerie calm, due to Morley's uncanny ability to stop time in its tracks without devolving into stasis. Though he avoids easy climaxes, the song still creates a kind of catharsis-- one felt more in reflection than action, more in reverberation than initiation. And it suggests that Morley's achievements on <i>Damned Revolutions </i>might resonate as long as <i>The Dew Line</i>'s have-- perhaps even longer.</p></div>"|17460.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17460-damned-revolutions/|7.3|Marc Masters

Its eerie presence is appropriate for a record defined by inescapable haunting and loss. On these six songs, bassist/vocalist Dylan Desmond and drummer/vocalist Adrian Guerra play patiently, and sparingly; they appear to be carefully purging themselves of an inexplicable force corrupting their bodies. Instead of going for a frontal assault, piling riffs upon riffs upon riffs, they opt for something subtler, a spacious approach that affects the entire nervous system.</p>
<p>The album opens with a 20 minute journey into despair, ""Bails (of Flesh)"", a track that will likely weed out those who can't handle the unrelentingly downcast feel of the record. The tracks get shorter from there, but they also get sparser. Of note is ""Longing (the River of Ash)"", which grows more drawn out as it progresses. In this music of solitude, it's the loneliest track by far. Metal's defined by exaggeration, but the title <i>Longing</i> is perfect here: Desmond and Guerra want to go back to where pain didn't consume their reality<i>.</i></p>
<p>A duo's primary challenge is to find a way to fill up space with minimal equipment. Usually, when a doom band's a two-piece, the guitars are double-amped and so downtuned that a bassist becomes irrelevant. Bell Witch flip this convention, employing a six-string bass in place of a guitar. (Often, one can hardly tell it's a bass.) Even lacking guitar, Desmond constructs melodies reminiscent of funeral doom acts like Skepticism and Esoteric, adding a touch of American dirtiness from his experience as the bassist of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30465-samothrace/"" target=""_blank"">Samothrace</a>.</p>
<p>There is one exception where the bass doesn't masquerade as a guitar. ""Beneath the Mask"", save for a sample from the Edgar Allen Poe-inspired film <i>The Masque of the Red Death</i>, is a five-minute drumless drone piece, where notes fly off and subsequently wither like Icarus on 33 1/3 RPM. The clean bass is more lonesome and more eerie than the distorted bass that the album's built upon. ""Mask"" seems like the perfect track to incorporate a sudden blast of hisses, feedback, screams-- something to make the listener jolt. It doesn't, and that suspense, like walking over rows of false trap doors, adds to the creepy atmosphere.</p>
<p>Throughout, Guerra's growls are complementary of the genre, and he even throws in a few blackened shrieks on ""Rows (of Endless Waves)"". Desmond's clean vocals, however, are more compelling, taking different shapes throughout the record. His warm, forlorn style carries the latter half of ""Bails (of Flesh)"", turning maudlin doom into perverted praise music. It's not a far stretch to imagine this being played in some church that worships self-destruction, congregants raising their hands up high, arms bleeding from cutting themselves. Desmond gives hails and salutations to the misery, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3222-om/"" target=""_blank"">Om</a> learning of a terminal illness diagnosis.</p>
<p>The previously mentioned ""Rows"" sees Desmond's voice become more delicate, almost crushing under the weight of the music. Frailty is important to the variety of doom Bell Witch explores, but rarely does a vocal performance capture what it is to stand on the line between sanity and madness. Desmond will whisper certain lines in ""Rows"", adding emphasis without raising his voice. He channels dISEMBOWELMENT's Renato Gallina on ""Longing"" making that track a true successor to the Australian doom-death quartet's 1993 classic <i>Transcendence into the Peripheral</i>. Remember that editorial arguing that <a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/08/23/op-ed-metal-vocalists-have-become-irrelevant/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">metal vocalists are irrelevant</a>? It wasn't entirely without merit, but Desmond challenges that line of thinking. He's got a cleverness and sense of space most vocalists don't possess. His voice is much like the music itself: it reverberates around, as if wandering and looking for a way out of this despair. Open and wide-reaching as it may be, there's also a sense of weighty claustrophobia in his voice, as if it's carrying his burdens, and the burdens of others, too.</p></div>"|17450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17450-longing/|8.0|Andy O'Connor

Or, more accurately, what <i>hasn't</i> happened since <i>Voodoo</i>. It's been 12 years since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7624-dangelo/"" target=""_blank"">D'Angelo </a>released his dirt-encrusted soul opus in the first month of the new millennium, and we have yet to see a follow-up. During those dozen calendar runs, the Virginia-bred singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer has learned to play guitar and spent countless hours in various studios, trying to find his way to the next sound. This time last year, unofficial D'Angelo status updater and kindred spirit/collaborator ?uestlove told me the new album is ""pretty much 97% done."" And this year, D played a number of live shows, his first in a decade. That's the upside.</p>
<p class=""p1"">He's also been arrested-- for disturbing the peace, marijuana possession, carrying a concealed weapon, and driving under the influence in 2005, and then for offering an undercover NYPD officer $40 for a blowjob in 2010. There were several attempts at rehab. And he's almost died at least once, when he drunkenly crashed through a fence and flipped his Hummer alongside Virginia's Route 711 seven years ago. In 2010, when I asked ?uestlove how his friend stacks up against the other luminaries he's worked with-- people like Jay-Z and Al Green-- he summed up the D'Angelo dilemma well: ""I consider him a genius beyond words. At the same time, I say to myself, 'How can I scream someone's genius if they hardly have any work to show for it?' Then again, the last work he did was so powerful that it's lasted 10 years.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">At this point, it's easy to forget that <i>Voodoo</i> itself was, for quite awhile, one of those forever-delayed studio myths, too. ""I've been gone so long, just wanna sing my song,"" D'Angelo sings on ""The Line"", a self-directed pep talk and explanation of his slug-like pace, ""I know you been hearing a lot of things about me."" <i>Voodoo</i> arrived five years behind D's home-recorded bap&amp;B debut, <i>Brown Sugar</i>, and blew through its fair share of release dates before touching down on January 25, 2000. Its arrival came during the twilight of the mega-CD era-- six months after Napster's birth, two years before the iPod-- but its four-year gestation occurred during the halcyon 90s, a time when artists were afforded the chance to tinker for years on end while blazing through bottomless studio budgets. The record topped the <i>Billboard</i> albums chart during its first two weeks out, and looking at 2000's other #1s-- including N'Sync's record-breaking <i>No Strings Attached</i>, Eminem's angsty <i>Marshall Mathers LP</i>, and, uh, Limp Bizkit's <i>Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water</i>-- <i>Voodoo</i> stands tall with October's <i>Kid A </i>as a paranoid, mysterious, and challenging artistic statement that somehow managed to scale the industry.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Riding high off of 1998's <i>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</i>, Maxwell's first two LPs, and Erykah Badu's 1997 album <i>Baduizm</i>, the so-called neo-soul movement, which favored earthy 70s production rather than 90s slickness, was reaching an apex in 2000. And <i>Voodoo</i> was positioned as a more down-to-earth alternative to the infinite excess of late-90s hip-hop and R&amp;B. ""[Contemporary R&amp;B]'s a joke,"" <a href=""http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/D/Dangelo/2000/01/21/744429.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">scoffed</a> D'Angelo at the time. ""It's sad-- the people making this shit have turned black music into a club thing."" (For his sake, here's hoping D hasn't flipped on the radio in the last five years.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">While this viewpoint may seem somewhat myopic in our poptimist era, to understand D'Angelo is to understand who he looked to for musical and spiritual guidance: Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, George Clinton, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, Al Green, Otis Redding, Prince-- supremely gifted artists known for expertly plying their craft. His devotion isn't merely cosmetic or fashionable, though-- by all accounts he's a hardcore music nerd who ""knows every Prince concert's playlist,"" <a href=""http://www.thedailyswarm.com/swarm/rational-conversation-amy-wallace-explores-dangelo-frank-ocean-and-transcending-rbs-limits/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">according to recent <i>GQ</i> profiler Amy Wallace</a>. His love of musical lore is partly why he chose to make <i>Voodoo</i> in Electric Lady Studios, the downtown Manhattan recording space Hendrix built in 1969. Listening to the album, his influences are apparent, but also ingrained in a way that's equal parts reverent and uncanny. Rather than just listening to old Funkadelic or Stevie albums for inspiration, <i>Voodoo</i> was literally born from them; a typical night at Electric Lady would have D, ?uestlove, bassist Pino Palladino, and maybe one or two of their prodigious buddies playing an entire classic soul album through, and then seeing where those jams led them. This went on for years. The result is ineffably natural, the type of live-in-studio sound that requires copious god-given talent-- D'Angelo started playing piano at age 4-- and constant woodshedding to really pull off. There are no shortcuts.</p>
<p class=""p1"">D'Angelo's old-school obsessions extended even further than songwriting inspiration. <i>Voodoo</i> was recorded on 2"" tape-- 120 reels of the stuff were used in total <a href=""http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/russell-elevado--elevate-your-mind"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">according to engineer Russell Elevado</a>-- and many of the songs' instrumental takes were recorded live without overdubs. Vintage gear was employed. The analog fetishism is ironic considering how, at the time of its release, vinyl had yet to make a resurgence; indeed, this 2xLP reissue is a godsend in that respect, especially for anyone who's considered dropping $100 on eBay for one of the few LPs originally made in 2000. I've been listening to this album since it came out-- my original 74-minute CD-R, burned from a friend, left out the 79-minute album's last song-- and it never gets old, or grating, or tired. While this is obviously largely due to the quality of the songs, it's hard not to think that the warm glow given off by the equipment and recording techniques used to create it factors in as well. Not all music needs to be built to last, but <i>Voodoo</i> was designed and willed and technically optimized to be a testament for the ages; it captures empty space and heartbreak as well as it does rim shots and joy. The grooves deepen. When the news of a bare-bones, no-bonus-tracks vinyl reissue causes palpable excitement 12 years later, it's a rare accomplishment.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But <i>Voodoo</i> is more than a fetish object for analog geeks and old-soul collectors. It's peppered with hip-hop inflections largely informed by the singular work of J Dilla, the record's biggest modern influence. D'Angelo probably had Dilla's beats in mind when he wanted ?uestlove to dirty his impeccable timing to drum like he had just ""drank some moonshine behind a chuckwagon,"" as ?uest once put it. In <a href=""http://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201206/dangelo-gq-june-2012-interview?printable=true"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1""><i>GQ</i></span></a>, D cited the Detroit producer's 2006 death as the moment he decided to wake up from his booze-and-cocaine fueled lost years. ""I felt like I was going to be next,"" he said. And when he <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7BfXDk47ws"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">played</a> this year's Made in America festival in Philadelphia, he stepped out to the strains of obscure Canadian band Motherlode's ""When I Die"", which Dilla flipped on the finale of his last true album, <i>Donuts</i>. The song's hook: ""When I die, I hope to be a better man than you thought I'd be."" <i>Voodoo</i>'s element of sampling is crucial and varied as well, whether through flawless interpolations (as on ""Send It On"", which borrows its horn-laden lilt from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzIWBiM0mSM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kool and the Gang's ""Sea of Tranquility""</a>), or sly cut-ups (like when DJ Premier drops in a line of Fat Joe's materialistic ""Success"" into the anti-materialism screed ""Devil's Pie""), or well-chosen covers (the slowed-down brilliance of ""Feel Like Makin' Love"", a #1 for Roberta Flack in 1974).</p>
<p class=""p1"">Given his extensive repertoire of male R&amp;B legends, the fact that D chose <i>Voodoo</i>'s only cover to be a song made famous by a woman also seems key. Because another aspect of the album's overall concept involves an embrace of femininity. ""The Aquarian Age is a matriarchal age, and if we are to exist as men in this new world many of us must learn to embrace and nurture that which is feminine with all of our hearts,"" wrote singer/poet Saul Williams in the record's liner notes. ""But is there any room for artistry in hip hop's decadent man-sion?"" The album's most uncharacteristic moment involves this schism between hip-hop and misogyny and feminism, when guest stars Method Man and Redman drop tone-deaf dick-fluffing broadsides on ""Left and Right"". (Intriguingly, Q-Tip recorded a more thematically appropriate verse for the track, though that version has yet to surface.) But everywhere else, <i>Voodoo</i> exhibits a mature attitude toward women and relationships-- one that doesn't pander, but empathizes, and shows that the then-26-year-old father of two was becoming acquainted with all sides of love.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Voodoo</i>'s second half, from ""One Mo' Gin"" through ""Africa"", goes from the depths of despondency, to regret, to carnal ecstasy, to something more spiritual and everlasting. These songs get to the bottom of nothing less than the core of human interaction; what happens when people collide and come together and break apart. And it's all done with the omnipotent knowing of a saint. Nothing is overstated. ""The Root"" is the record's most downtrodden track lyrically, where D'Angelo confesses, ""I feel my soul is empty, my blood is cold and I can't feel my legs/ I need someone to hold me, bring me back to life before I'm dead."" But instead of dour instrumentation, the song's accompanying rhythm is comforting, warm. The whole song leads to a kind of exorcism-- in its final minutes, the singer masterfully layers his own voice on top of itself, vocal lines coming in at every imaginable direction, offering a peek inside his brain. Then it all smooths out, finding comfort in infinity: ""From the Alpha of creation, to the end of all time."" D'Angelo knows these stakes are high but, as he concludes on ""The Line"", ""If I can hold on, I'm sure everything will be alright."" <i>Voodoo</i> is the sound of him holding on; its ensuing silence marks his lost grip.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Details also give <i>Voodoo</i> its timelessness. The album's gentle avoidance of common song structures adds spontaneity; even after hundreds of listens, it's still possible to be surprised. The barely-heard words spoken in intros and outros give things continuity and a voyeuristic quality, like you're hearing it all through a city wall; listen again for the the sweetly awkward conversation with an ex that starts ""One Mo' Gin"" or the way ""Greatdayndamornin'"" is introduced with D'Angelo praising ?uestlove to journalist dream hampton: ""I was like, 'You gonna be my drummer one of these days,'"" gushes D.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The concept of voodoo itself-- as portrayed via the record's voodoo-ceremony photos-- is multi-layered. While probably using voodoo's exaggerated and misrepresented image within modern popular culture to add some mystique and danger, D'Angelo's also likely referencing the religion's African origins, and how it was coveted by uprooted slaves, feared by slave owners, and ignited the Haitian Revolution of 1791. D'Angelo was born the son of a Pentecostal minister, and he was exposed to that religion's closely intertwining relationship between the spiritual and earthly realms: speaking in tongues, divine healing. And music. ""I learned at an early age that what we were doing in the choir was just as important as the preacher,"" he told <i>GQ</i>. ""The stage is our pulpit, and you can use all of that energy and that music and the lights and the colors and the sound. But you know, you've got to be careful."" Coming out of D's mouth, this is more than hokum-- he believes it and he makes you believe it. There are many ghosts hidden within this record. They're still being drawn out. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Still, many simply know <i>Voodoo</i> for a certain naked music video. The clip for ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxVNOnPyvIU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Untitled (How Does It Feel)</a>"" is the reason why the album went platinum, and it plays a large part in D's ensuing disappearance. It instantly transformed the singer from a very talented artist to a pin-up. The song was the last track recorded for <i>Voodoo</i>, and it's the most direct thing here, a churning Prince-inspired ballad that bests nearly every actual ballad Prince ever recorded. It's about lust, sure, but it's a two-way street. The way he sings it, ""how does it feel?"" isn't necessarily rhetorical, no matter how much it should be considering the power of the music. And if you look closely, the video isn't just a handsome and muscular guy flexing his pecs. There's a vulnerability in D'Angelo's eyes, an awkwardness that's both endearing and slightly uncomfortable.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">""You've got to realize, he'd never looked like that before in his life,"" D's trainer Mark Jenkins told <i>Spin</i> in 2008. ""To be somebody who was so introverted, and then, in a matter of three or four months, to be so ripped-- everything was happening so quickly."" The video became a phenomenon and, soon enough, women were standing at the lip of D'Angelo's stage, telling him to take off his clothes. The attention was infuriating to him, and it sent the singer to a dark place-- all that work, all that time blown away by a few sweaty shots of his abdomen. Then again, while he was hesitant, he still shot the video. The unfortunate ordeal causes writer Jason King to conclude, in this reissue's new liner notes: ""</span>For all of <i>Voodoo</i>'s claims to realness and authenticity, D'Angelo's imaging, while rooted in promise, had been in some ways a charade, an unsustainable performance of black masculinity gone awry.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">""I got something I'm seeing; I got a vision,"" D'Angelo told <i>Time</i> upon <i>Voodoo</i>'s release. ""This album is the second step to that vision."" It seems safe to say the prophecy he was speaking about did not entail more than a decade of nothingness, or drug addiction, or shame. Now, it's difficult to say where this vision is leading. Playing an upbeat new funk track called ""Sugar Daddy"" at this year's <a href=""http://www.bet.com/video/betawards/2012/performances/dangelo.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BET Awards</a>, he looked solid, and his voice sounded fantastic, but it was almost as interesting to watch the cutaway shots-- to see Nicki Minaj staring on, seemingly confused, or Kanye talking to someone during the performance, or Beyonce standing up, loving every second. (BET headlined the clip: ""D'Angelo's Sexiest Performance Ever!"")</p>
<p class=""p1"">There's a big difference between a prodigious, smooth-skinned 26-year-old playing retro-styled music and a 38-year-old doing the same thing. The backwards-looking pose can calcify; by the time Prince was 38, he was well into his symbol phase. That said, D'Angelo is the quintessential old soul. And there's hope in the comebacks of fellow 90s refugees Maxwell and Badu, who both released some of their best work after long layoffs over the last few years. But D'Angelo's inactivity has only helped to inflate <i>Voodoo</i>'s myth, though it doesn't need much help. It's frustrating to think about how someone so enamored with the past, who knew his heroes' failures so well, could be doomed to repeat them. It's almost as if he studied them too much, and the same spiritual power that fueled his greatest moment couldn't help but bring him down. Like that's how he thought it was supposed to go. In an interview between ?uestlove and D around the release of <i>Voodoo</i>, the drummer confronted the singer about his idols: ""They all have one thing in common, they were all vanguards, but 98% of them crashed and burned."" To which D'Angelo responded: ""I think about that all the time.""</p></div>"|17407.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17407-voodoo/|10.0|Ryan Dombal

That question, of course, has fascinated centuries of thinkers, from philosophers plundering mortality's meaning to laypeople simply hoping to have their affairs in order when life comes to a close. In most cases, the end is unpredictable-- a car crash, a heart attack, a disease that comes on swiftly and decisively. But businesses often sense that doom is inevitable, that accounts receivable are no longer balancing accounts payable in a way that's sustainable. They have the rare choice of how to handle their own demise: They can choose to hide this from their customers <a href=""http://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/hospital-productions-retail-store-closed-go-occupy-something-stop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">and one day simply shutter the doors</a>, or they can choose to throw themselves on the great public pyre, making a show of their mortality and allowing the faithful to plunder their wares another time or two.</p>
<p>In September, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47811-rip-hydra-head-records/"" target=""_blank"">Hydra Head Records joined the latter caste</a>: For nearly two decades, Hydra Head has been a fearless syndicate of loud, a label at the vanguard of risky releases paired with adventurous packaging. In 1999, for instance, they released Isis' excellent <i>Sawblade EP</i>-- notably, featuring a cover of Godflesh's ""Streetcleaner""-- on a CD-R affixed to a full-size metallic sawblade, painted red or black. Consistent with Hydra Head founder Aaron Turner's ecumenical vision of heavy, they embraced the grindcore of Agoraphobic Nosebleed, the wretched malevolence of Khanate, the noise purges of Merzbow, the arithmetic bludgeon of the Austerity Program, and the astral wonder of Pyramids, to name a few.</p>
<p>The list of accomplishments is exhausting. It exhausted Hydra Head's funds, too, leading the label to announce the first of two going-out-of-business fire sales in September: Enthusiasts could buy bundles of backstock at incredibly deep discounts, with the hope of paying the bills and finishing the final releases. Two months later, Hydra Head put test pressings, original artwork, and even Turner's Les Paul on sale with the hope of raising enough money to keep the label’s sizable back catalogue in permanent circulation. The willingness of customers to <a href=""http://www.realtomatoketchup.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">spend</a> $800 on a Torche and Boris 10"" or $180 on an Isis box set became a functional tribute to the label, a way to push it into some future while kowtowing to its expiring glory.  </p>
<p>Hydra Head's final (for now) release has much the same effect: A split between Godflesh/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2238-jesu/"" target=""_blank"">Jesu</a> leader <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5682-justin-k-broadrick/"" target=""_blank"">Justin K. Broadrick</a> under his new solo moniker, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30409-jk-flesh/"" target=""_blank"">JK Flesh</a>, and prolific electronic noise insurgent Dominick Fernow as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"" target=""_blank"">Prurient</a>, the six-track <i>Worship is the Cleansing of Imagination</i> serves as a cross-generational cycle between two aggressive sonic explorers. Broadrick's three tracks here are the more concussive, comprising electronic drums massive enough to suggest EBM on steroids and damaged textures occasionally abrasive enough to be classified as power electronics. His opener, ""Fear of Fear"", is a savage and short trip, a cyclone of a beat rumbling through fields of bass and blown-out guitars. Fernow focuses less on a pulse, instead using loops and layers to build a cyclone of sound that he either subsequently pulls apart or simply lets collapse. He leads with ""Chosen Books"", which matches Broadrick's gambit by dogpiling roars and whirs and hums until the frame of the sound system begins to quiver. These are similar but separate paths to the same plane of aggression, an idea that could serve as the retroactive Hydra Head mantra.   </p>
<p>The best cuts on either side bear out that idea, too: ""Deceiver"" is Broadrick's most provocative and ambitious cut here. It opens as an industrial dirge, the toll of a church bell stretched into a subterranean groan. That sound cycles throughout the piece, while Broadrick adds and removes layers like a marionette. The hyperkinetic beat occasionally bursts open to douse the track in noisy shrapnel and low-end torture. ""Deceiver"" casts Broadrick as the controller of his past, able to funnel his experiences into these intense five minutes. <i>Worship</i> closes with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14510-i-understand-you/"" target=""_blank"">""I Understand You""</a>, one of the most strangely beautiful pieces of music in the catalogues of Prurient or Hydra Head. Fernow wrestles simultaneously with disparate sets of impulses, attempting to thread a punishing squelch sustain around a keyboard line that hovers just on the horizon. The din overtakes the melody for a bit, but Fernow eventually pulls both themes back together before letting the keyboard disappear entirely. The noise spreads like ivy on a wall of disappearing ruins.</p>
<p>Both Broadrick and Fernow share the broad musical view implicitly espoused by Hydra Head for the last two decades. Broadrick's oeuvre stretches from the atavistic blast of Napalm Death's debut and the militant stomp of Godflesh to the diaphanous loom of Jesu and the exploratory throb of Techno Animal. In Prurient, Fernow has wrestled with noise and poetry, corrupted beats and rhythm-less roars. He's made black metal in Ash Pool, muted and mutated pop melodies in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30495-vatican-shadow/"" target=""_blank"">Vatican Shadow</a>, and gone for full-on dance bombast in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave/"" target=""_blank"">Cold Cave</a>. If Hydra Head is indeed done, this is an excellent and appropriate ending for a big-eared label never confined by expectations of its output or intentions. These six tracks provide heaviness in a half-dozen different ways, a functional and fitting elegy for an imprint that achieved that mission with enviable consistency.</p></div>"|17406.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17406-worship-is-the-cleansing-of-the-imagination/|8.0|Grayson Currin

Dignity's overrated, anyway; if you leveled the accusation at him, he'd probably work it into a rhyme about Blackstreet so he could remind you how much he likes ""No Diggity"". When you've sold 10 million albums abasing yourself at every available opportunity, there's no reason to change course, and on his fifth studio collection, the Game is still happily, busily, thoroughly ethering himself beyond all comprehension: ""I don’t care if Kanye hit it/ I don’t care if Jay hit it/ I’ma eat it up and I’ma lay with it"" he says on the first verse of ""I Remember"", a song that is a bald imitation of Future's ""Same Damn Time"", with Future himself on the hook. Looking away yet? He's just getting started.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some other things the Game says on </span><i>Jesus Piece</i><span>: He reminds us on ""Freedom"", </span><span>again</span><span>, that Eminem murdered him on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3663-the-documentary/"" target=""_blank""><i>T</i></a></span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3663-the-documentary/"" target=""_blank""><i>he Documentary</i></a><span>'s ""We Ain't"", as if if wasn't embarrassing enough when he exclaimed it on that very song. He tells us that his iPod is ""shuffling between Common, Jay Electronica, and Bono"" on ""Heaven's Arms"". At one point, he interrupts himself to say ""Hold on, I gotta take Birdman's call,"" before interpolating audio of a Birdman voicemail. He yells ""Murder is what I do to these Just Blazes,"" on an album produced entirely without Just Blaze's input. Game's business is making you cringe for him, and business is...well, it remains a business.</span></p>
<p><span>Truthfully, it's a little shocking to see another Game product in stores a mere year after </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15759-the-red-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>The R.E.D. Album</i></a><span>, a  project with a development so troubled it redefined the lengths a record label will go to double down on a losing hand. It hit the top of the charts with what felt like a dead-cat-bounce, but here the Game is, seemingly unscathed, with another full platter of his signature blend of desperate-networker hip-hop. He is the rap game Wile E. Coyote; no matter how many times he blows himself to smithereens, he survives to do it again another day. </span></p>
<p><span>What presumably keeps him going-- besides, of course, a frightening, </span><span>""Walking Dead""</span><span>-like tenacity-- is that when you scrape away all these irritating quirks, he remains reliably good at cobbling together poppy gangsta-rap songs. He's always boasted excellent, if unadventurous, taste in beats, and he sources some excellent ones on </span><i>Jesus Piece </i><span>from SAP, a 22-year-old kid from Delaware whose biggest hits thus far have been Mac Miller's ""Donald Trump"" and Meek Mill's pre-MMG street hit </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WicZQ98CprE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""In My Bag""</span></a><span>. SAP provides the catchy Bone Thugs redux ""Celebration"" and the choir-sampling ""Name Me King"", a song that also has a sharply focused verse from Pusha T. Jake One gives him an infectious early-Kanye-style beat, reminiscent of ""The Glory"", for ""Hallelujah"", and Game makes a very early-Kanye-style song out of it. Longtime collaborators Cool &amp; Dre soak his ruined voice in greyscale synth tones in ""Can't Get Right"" and ""Pray"" and then give him a helium-filled bouncy castle of New Jack Swing vocals on ""All That"".</span></p>
<p><span>The album and song titles hint at a sustained religious fascination, but this isn't Game's concept album. Even so, it's more focused than he's been in awhile, and while you couldn't call an album featuring 2Chainz, Rick Ross, Meek Mill, Lil Wayne (twice), Future, Young Jeezy, Chris Brown, Common, Pusha T, Jamie Foxx, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar and more ""lean,"" </span><i>Jesus Piece</i><span> is less all-over-the-place than </span><i>The R.E.D. Album</i><span>. Except for an embarrassing breakout of ""hanhs"" on the Kanye-sampling title track and his blood-draining Future imitation on ""I Remember"", he mostly keeps a lid on his irritating habit of mimicking other rappers' flows. </span></p>
<p><span>The flip side to being prone to saying any fool thing that pops into your head is that you can occasionally be hilarious: on ""Church"", he for some reason kidnaps and attempts to drown a woman before saving her and explaining to her that she was baptized. On ""Can't Get Right"", he continues his long string of </span><a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/samir/overly-attached-girlfriend-is-the-girlfriend-mem"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>overly attached girlfriend </span></a><span>messages to Dr. Dre, telling us that after Dre passed him up to work on Kendrick Lamar's record, he had ""nightmares"" that someone shot him. The Game's contract with Interscope is up after this record and something tells me that wherever he goes next, it will be messy to watch, and probably just as entertaining. Seven years into a career that's resembled a slow-motion wreck as often as a highlight reel, and I remain morbidly fascinated with what will happen to him next.</span></p></div>"|17469.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17469-jesus-piece/|6.0|Jayson Greene

Calling a band or an album a side project suggests that it's a dabble, a dodge, an exercise that might be fun or instructive for the participants but only of passing interest to the audience. And if you've spent a lot of time (or even just a little) trying to create something, that kind of reduction is pretty annoying. Perhaps that's why these, ahem, ""exploratory enterprises"" seem to be treated with greater seriousness lately. Is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30530-divine-fits/"" target=""_blank"">Divine Fits</a> a side project? How about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28660-atoms-for-peace/"" target=""_blank"">Atoms for Peace</a>? Didn't <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1866-gnarls-barkley/"" target=""_blank"">Gnarls Barkley</a> start out as a partnership between artists known for other things, and then become <i>the </i>thing that made Cee-Lo Green and Danger Mouse mainstream stars?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions are: ""Not really,"" ""more so than Divine Fits but not totally,"" and ""of course, though it's nothing compared to what <i>The Voice </i>did for Cee-Lo<i>.</i>"" Still, even if we agree that side projects being treated with the same respect as ""real"" projects is a good thing, it doesn't mean the term as it was originally intended is necessarily bad. Take San Francisco's Window Twins, a collaboration between Tim Cohen of psych-rockers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28104-the-fresh-onlys/"" target=""_blank"">the Fresh &amp; Onlys</a> and Jon Bernson of the deconstructivist electro-pop group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29233-exrays/"" target=""_blank"">Exray's</a>. Cohen and Bernson have recorded two albums together, including the new <i>Wish</i>, a collection of atmospheric sketches that explore the scuzzy, sinister, and lo-fi fringes of jazzy R&amp;B, and ramshackle folk. It's not a fully realized record or especially immediate, and it's not really intended to be; <i>Wish</i> has the freeform adventurousness of an extemporaneous experiment, where the process is ultimately more important than the finished result. And, if appreciated in this context, it's a fascinating listen.</p>
<p>The album opening ""Two Left Feet"" is easily the most song-like track on <i>Wish</i>, sounding only slightly murkier than the Fresh &amp; Onlys' excellent 2009 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13507-grey-eyed-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Grey-Eyed Girls</a>. </i>But for the most part, <i>Wish </i>is more about trying out sonic textures than presenting polished compositions, establishing a mood that grows more unsettling as the album progresses. ""The Sky is Back"" is typical of <i>Wish</i>'s smudged soulful malevolence, with its skittering beat and bright horn washes. On the glowering ""Others"", a cowpunk gallop clicks along like a clock, which is echoed by Cohen's menacing ""tick tock"" refrain. That paranoia of ""Others""-- echoed by Cohen's insistence that ""there's others in the world, don't forget about that/ you know there's others out there""-- deepens on the creepy ""Good People"", which pairs a despairing lyric (""when good people go away/ where do they go"") with a spare, Massive Attack-like groove.</p>
<p>This is a far cry from the Fresh &amp; Onlys' most recent album, the pretty and poppy <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16992-long-slow-dance/"" target=""_blank"">Long Slow Dance</a>. </i>If Cohen was repressing his dark side on that record, he indulges it fully with Bernson, and in the process tries out weird sounds that no longer fit with the Fresh &amp; Onlys' more streamlined presentation. About half of the time, the diversions don't coalesce, like on the woozy ""Thunder and Lightning"", which sways uneasily between promising abstraction and unfocused puttering. The bold ""Wine Into Winter"", with its minute-long drum solo and full-on jazz-rock affectations, is better, though mostly as a window into whatever Cohen and Bernson might do with their ""other"" groups. <i>Wish </i>works only intermittently on its own terms, but as a sketchbook for future the Fresh &amp; Onlys and Exray's releases, it's potentially illuminating.</p></div>"|17470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17470-wish/|6.2|Steven Hyden

It is the first album for Dean Blunt as a solo artist after several releases with his recording partner Inga Copeland (first as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29386-hype-williams/"" target=""_blank"">Hype Williams</a> and then as Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland), though Copeland makes appearances here. A remixed and remastered version of a free, 30-minute ""mixtape"" Blunt dropped in February, <i>The Narcissist II</i> is is the least substantial release in a discography that avoids substance by design. A droopy-eyed, unromantic collage of synthesizers, movie dialogue, and baked vocals, <i>The Narcissist II</i> comments on the ephemerality of modern media consumption by being ephemeral itself.</p>
<p>In particular, <i>The Narcissist II</i> replicates a very specific type of listening: hunching over a laptop, dozens of Chrome tabs open, crawling down a Youtube rabbit hole. You know the drill: locate an obscure track, listen to half of it, click on something ""related"" in the right sidebar, pause it, tab over to a Soundcloud page... tab back. It is consumption via distraction: do this often enough and you'll encounter no end of noisy vinyl rips and shitty covers. This is the best metaphor for <i>The Narcissist II</i>: distant, half-heard clips; novel, obscure, and impossible. The samples blur into the original until <i>The Narcissist II</i> is the noisy rip, the shitty homage.</p>
<p>This is why, during the course of <i>The Narcissist II</i>, at some point nearly everything will seem like a sample. The simple chord riff that beautifies <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14494-the-narcissist/"" target=""_blank"">the title track</a>, the <i>Nuggets</i>-y guitar riff that populates ""XXX"", the descending organ that buoys ""caught feelings""-- anything could be pilfered, because it all sounds familiar. And then there are the elements that actually are stolen: a single, guttural ""uhnf!"" from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>, the melody of Biz Markie's ""Just a Friend"" splayed over ""Are You as Good as I Remember"", ongoing movie dialogue sketching a nasty domestic dispute. (The latter being the first time, perhaps, that the menace and violence in Blunt's music has been made explicit.) At the start of ""Direct Line 2"", the harsh, hot sound of a cell phone placed too close to a speaker crackles; I wince every time, and search for my phone on my desk.</p>
<p><i>The Narcissist II</i>, though, is better at providing an experience than truly memorable music. This is the salty electro-dub of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1411-excepter/"" target=""_blank"">Excepter</a> minus the forgivable nature of generative music, and the flaky, paper mache edits of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a> minus any obvious affection for the source material. Blunt, always conversant in hip-hop, actually steps up to the mic on the closer, ""Coroner"", on which he tells you that ""That sweet apple-bottom gonna get candied."" Blunt's delivery is flat, ugly, and devoid of braggadocio; for the first time I consider that his taken surname might not be wholly weed-inspired. This isn't great music just like addled Youtube-ing isn't a great way to experience art. Like a lot of free internet mixtapes, <i>The Narcissist II</i> is compelling but ultimately shallow, and shallow is a fault, even if that's what Blunt was aiming for.

She released a string of masterpieces that redefined, on a grand scale, what a ""pop star"" looks and sounds like and how the avant-garde relates to the mainstream, as well as changing our conception of what makes a voice beautiful. Her earlier albums were so good they warped the light around all that has followed; as visible as Björk has become, she's getting harder and harder to see. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Increasingly, her albums reach us as the eye of a storm of extracurricular activities. With all this diversifying, Björk seems on a ""post pop-stardom public intellectual"" tenure track that brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"" target=""_blank"">David Byrne</a>. Starting at around 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10204-volta/"" target=""_blank""><i>Volta</i></a>, her new albums began to feel less like events themselves and more like the musical arm of some broader project. This tendency reached its peak on 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15915-biophilia/"" target=""_blank""><i>Biophilia</i></a>, an album celebrating the wonders of natural science that was also a series of interactive iPad apps that was also a series of shows at the New York Hall of Science. For me, this was where the signal-to-noise ratio in Björk's work finally, definitively tipped. As a series of ideas, <i>Biophilia</i> was glorious -- fascinating to think about, awe-inspiring in its reach. As an album, it was often turgid, frankly boring, and rarely worth leaving on.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The <i>Biophilia</i> remixes you find on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48560-stream-bjorks-biophilia-remix-album-with-death-grips-hudson-mohawke-these-new-puritans-more/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bastards</i></a> have been commercially available  in other forms for months; they began trickling out shortly after the album was released in a series of 12-inches, released periodically. <i>Bastards</i> represents a capstone on the <i>Biophilia</i> project, but it is also the end of a dizzying breadcrumb-trail of packaging and repackaging. Pity the hardcore Björk fan; like the lifelong Trent Reznor or Radiohead fan, they are faced with an idol whose musical creativity  is only matched by their ingenuity in dreaming up new ways to separate their faithful from disposable income.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As a standalone product, <i>Bastards</i> feels distressingly unnecessary. But if you didn't want to scoop up these remixes piecemeal and were waiting for a handy package, it is here for you. They occasionally offer new angles from the somewhat-blocky <i>Biophilia</i> material; the album's three most dynamic songs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12242-crystalline/"" target=""_blank"">""Crystalline""</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43456-listen-new-bjork-virus/"" target=""_blank"">""Virus""</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48572-watch-bjorks-explosive-video-for-mutual-core/"" target=""_blank"">""Mutual Core""</a>, receive the most attention. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13560-virus-hudson-mohawke-peaches-and-guacamol-rework/"" target=""_blank"">Hudson Mohawke gives ""Virus"" a gleaming new coat of paint</a> built from of comet-trails synths and massive synthesized horns; it generates the same stonerish awe that anyone who has ever gaped at a planetarium ceiling will recognize.</p>
<p class=""p1""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46239-listen-bjork-remixed-by-death-grips/"" target=""_blank"">Death Grips contribute a pair of remixes</a>, one to ""Sacrifice"" and one to ""Thunderbolt"", both of which send a shot of bad-coke energy skittering through the material. ""Sacrifice""'s margins are filled with mortar-round percussion sounds and sampled snuffling-creature noises, while the glacial church-organ dirge of ""Thunderbolt"", is given a shot of adrenaline through that brings to mind a New Order song hyperventilating. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5694-these-new-puritans/"" target=""_blank"">These New Puritans</a> strip all the elements out from underneath Björk's astonishing vocal take and surround her with drizzly bits of bass, piano, and a mournfully chanting vocal ensemble.  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27844-omar-souleyman/"" target=""_blank"">Omar Souleyman</a> more or less ditches all the elements that make Björk's songs her own and throws Björk's ""Crystalline"" vocals over a piece of his signature dabke music, transforming it into Syrian New Wave.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The best remixes here remind that Björk's voice remains an endlessly malleable instrument, capable of mapping itself onto nearly any context. But apart from Hudson Mohawke's luminous ""Virus"", there are few revelations wrung from this thin material. In 30 tantalizing seconds <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1931-matthew-herbert/"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Herbert</a> offers us a breath-caught, ecstatic recasting of ""Sacrifice"", in which the song suddenly feels like an outpouring on the order of ""Joga"". But it disappears just as quickly as it hits, and <i>Bastards</i> does little to counteract the sensation that latter-day Björk records are more fulfilling to read about than listen to. </p></div>"|17386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17386-bastards/|5.2|Jayson Greene

It would be nice if, for instance, it turned out that the British soul revivalist had completed or at least sketched out another jewel of a record during the turbulent last four years of her life. But she didn't: there was her collaboration with Mark Ronson on ""Valerie"", and the new song-and-a-half that turned up on last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16112-lioness-hidden-treasures/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lioness: Hidden Treasures</i></a>, which was otherwise stocked with alternate versions, earlier outtakes, and covers. A live album that lived up to what she could do at her best would be welcome, too. But her post-<i>Back to Black</i> gigs were relatively few and, by all accounts, mostly pretty dodgy.</p>
<p>So-- perhaps a set of radio recordings, then? That's something, right? <i>At the BBC</i> cherrypicks 48 minutes' worth of tracks from live-on-stage and live-in-the-studio broadcasts. It adds two otherwise unreleased titles to the Winehouse discography: covers of the standards ""I Should Care"" and ""Lullaby of Birdland"", from the latter of which Winehouse borrowed a bit for her own ""October Song"". And it's sequenced in order of her albums' original release rather than in order of the performances-- all the <i>Frank</i> songs, then all the <i>Back to Black</i> songs, then the other stuff. That covers up for the fact that only two tracks here were recorded in the rocky 2007-2011 period: a blaring ""Just Friends"" and a stripped-down ""Love Is a Losing Game"", both from 2009. It also provides an excuse to lead the album with a 2004 take of ""Know You Now"" that's a marked improvement on the <i>Frank</i> recording.</p>
<p>Winehouse always had a tendency to over sing on stage, though. Especially when she had a big audience to project toward, it was too easy for her to overindulge in the vocal tics-- the slurred consonants, the hyper-articulated melisma, the extravagant ornaments, the imitations of Billie Holiday's timbre-- that she could restrain on her better studio recordings, and it often led her to mangle her own lyrics. (She pronounces the final word of ""F%#k Me Pumps"" here as ""pwuuuups."") The most effective performances here are the most intimate ones, especially on the attached DVD-- an hour-long documentary built around a 22-minute set filmed shortly after the release of <i>Back to Black</i>, just Winehouse, a guitarist and a bassist playing inside a little Irish church.</p>
<p>The versions of Winehouse's repertoire that turn up on <i>At the BBC</i>'s audio disc, though, are almost all sloppier than their studio counterparts, and she rarely manages to reveal anything we didn't already know about her songs. And every time she garbles a phrase or pointedly mentions her vices, it's a stinging reminder that she spent the better part of her too-brief career making her audience complicit in her self-destruction. This set isn't devoid of interest, but it's not in any way another great Amy Winehouse album, or even another good one. We're never going to get that.</p></div>"|17295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17295-at-the-bbc/|3.1|Douglas Wolk

But of course, there is a downside for the artists in question. Even those in tightly knit communities rarely sound exactly alike or make music about exactly the same thing, or in the exact same way. Chicago's drill scene is no different-- there are artists there, even young ones, making rap music unlike the hollowed-out rattle of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"" target=""_blank"">Chief Keef</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30559-lil-reese/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Reese</a>. One of them is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30216-lil-durk/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Durk</a>, a Chicago teen and GBE associate, who is one of the the city's forgotten figures and who released his second mixtape of the year, <i>Life Ain't No Joke</i>, this fall.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why Durk has been overlooked is because he spent parts of 2012 in prison right as Chicago's rap scene really started to explode. Locally, Durk has long been recognized -- ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAMgw5PyD-o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L's Anthem""</a>, his single from earlier this year, was one of the biggest songs in the city. But on a national level he lags behind compatriots Chief Keef and Lil Reese, though maybe that's a good thing for Durk, as Keef and Reese remain toxic figures to many. Durk doesn't much sound like either guy; instead, he leans heavily on one under-discussed aspect of drill music: Autotune, and drowning music in it.</p>
<p class=""p2"">People thought Autotune was going to go away (or at least <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11304-doa-death-of-auto-tune/"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z did</a>), but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future's</a> ascendance has given it as strong a place in contemporary rap as its just about ever had. The Autotune of the drill scene, though, is of a different nature-- its birthplace is in the stoned, aimless warbling of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29609-soulja-boy/"" target=""_blank"">Soulja Boy</a> (one of the earliest non-local Keef collaborators) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a> before him. A good portion of <i>Life Ain't No Joke </i>(tracks like ""Ryder"" and ""Days of Our Lives"") finds Durk dunking what would be typical drill music into a vat of Autotune to no real positive outcome-- as an effect used with abandon here it grates without purpose. </p>
<p>Which isn't to say that Durk's Autotune fixation is a complete distraction. ""Molly Girl"" seems like it should be a throwaway track, but instead it's one of the tape's clear highlights. It's one of the few songs where Durk goes full pop, which is surprising considering that his flirtations with singing seem to indicate that he's aiming more for a traditional modern crossover than the rest of his peers. But the track has a deceptively intricate hook that is still plainly enjoyable and it's easy to picture it bubbling up to radio. ""Right Here"" is more of a rap song, but one where Durk's use of Autotune amplifies the song's anthem status instead of detracting from it. </p>
<p>The absolute most promising joint, though, is ""52 Barz (Intro)"", a jittery track that sees Durk rapping for three minutes straight. It has a confessional bent but is enlivened by a gleeful arrogance and unflinching confidence, which is roughly the same formula that has turned <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30022-meek-mill/"" target=""_blank"">Meek Mill</a> into one of rap's most beloved new artists. The song recalls Durk's earlier single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13104-i-get-paid-ft-king-louie/"" target=""_blank"">""I Get Paid""</a>, a straight party track whose beat had roots in Chicago footwork but which would slot perfectly next to any Meek banger like ""House Party."" Durk may not turn out to be Meek and he may not even have that kind of art in mind, but it seems like the best case scenario for him would be evolving into the same type of artist.</p>
<p>All that is still in the distance, at least we should hope. Meek, for instance, was dozens of mixtapes and a handful of years into the game before getting his shot with Rick Ross. Durk has talent-- he has an ear for pop tracks and can spit bars when we wants to. But whether or not he'll be able to figure it all out before the rap game's focus shifts elsewhere is entirely an open question.</p></div>"|17441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17441-life-aint-no-joke/|6.5|Jordan Sargent

A lot of the time his live performances with other artists, well-documented on YouTube, are set to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvXH2mKcZYU&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UU7KikwDgC3bwUNb8Z8HFT0Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">spooky visuals</a>, and in those that aren't Maggi wears quite frightening <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfnSULWGZCk&amp;list=UU7KikwDgC3bwUNb8Z8HFT0Q&amp;index=27&amp;feature=plcp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">masks</a>. Sure, quite a bit of that does sound like the sort of standard gimmickry rife in 2012, but there's something about Emiliano Maggi's music that feels genuinely otherworldly and unusual.</p>
<p>Maggi's vocal plays a starring role in that strangeness on his debut album, <i>Wild Songs</i>. His high-pitched, androgynous sounding voice is technically a coloratura soprano-- most often a range delivered by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93dtHzIUL4g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">female</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbUDokpYKe8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">opera</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-GPxk8n0aE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">singers</a>. In opera, the coloratura soprano is characterised not just by the dizzying heights of their top notes, but by their technical agility too. While Maggi seems a way off performing at classical standard, on songs like ""Wonder"", his vocal skips and swoops ornately. Though quite different in some aspects, Maggi's voice also calls to mind the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank"">Sigur Rós</a>' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2GjOC79gVI&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jonsi</a> or new Acéphale label-mate Tom Krell's early releases as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFndNLPfLUo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">How to Dress Well</a>.</p>
<p>The recordings themselves also share something in common with HtDW's ghostly first demos. Maggi's naturalistic takes on <i>Wild Songs</i> are lo-fi and weave in field recordings as part of the scene. Those far-off touches of real atmosphere and places really help ground <i>Wild Songs</i>. Among the strangeness, those moments pull you back to reality: moments like at the end of ""It's a Hard World for Little Things"" when the sound of kindling snapping in a fire slowly fades up in the mix, or the howling pack of dogs that accompany Maggi on ""Kaspar"".</p>
<p>Compared with the sparseness of the rest of Estasy's material, ""Locus Solus"" and ""Wild Wants"" feel almost maximalist. On both tracks, electronic beats help to anchor Maggi's otherwise untethered melodies: the playful beat of the former allows his subtle melodies to feel almost whimsical, but the latter is elevated by drums to become perhaps the most intense moment on the whole record. It feels like a yearning, natural highlight of the set, as multi-tracked vocals swoop around one another with ease and grace.</p>
<p><i>Wild Songs</i> is an apt title for Estasy's first record. Many of these songs feel like barely captured ideas, almost like happy accidents of rolling tape. Maggi's voice is the star, capable of inspiring genuine strangeness. Its undiluted innateness feels natural among the production's field recording feel. That said, <i>Wild Songs</i> is very rough and ready. At its best it can be utterly startling, but so far Maggi's Estasy project feels more intriguing than truly beguiling.</p></div>"|17416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17416-wild-songs/|6.9|Hari Ashurst

In Joseph <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/10502-raglani/"" target=""_blank"">Raglani</a>'s hectic mix, synths ripple in overlapping circles, melodies dive into longer tones, beats morph from pin pricks into plunges, and churning static melts into what sounds like a funk band jamming underwater. His hyperactive sound doesn't just encourage repeat listens-- it makes you wonder if you could ever hear it the same way twice.</p>
<p>Making music sound busy isn't unique, especially when it's electronic; nor is it a guarantee of quality. But even though Raglani's approach has precedents, his knack for mixing and matching sounds, through wavy dissolves, liquefied cuts, and coursing turns, is distinct. In a sense, he's equal parts musician and DJ-- attentive enough to sonic detail that he avoids mere pastiche, but restless enough that his insistence on adding new ideas injects everything with constant energy.</p>
<p>Part of why <i>Real Colors</i> feels so busy is that its first two tracks last over 20 minutes each, and they unfurl like eventful journeys. Apparently portions were designed separately, since the track list includes parenthetical subtitles. Maybe if Raglani had added gaps of silence in between, <i>Real Colors</i> would be easier to digest-- but it wouldn't be as interesting, or as enjoyable. Because as fascinating as the individual passages are, the fissions between them are even more striking.</p>
<p>Examples abound. I'm partial to a section early in opener ""Fog of Interruption"" where a blasting synth crumbles into distant transmissions, then rises from the dead in the form of shiny, laser-like reflections. Even better is a passage in the following track, ""Terrain of Antiquity"", wherein a chaotic mass of lighting-bolt synths slowly turns into a vocoder-like melody that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3563-the-residents/"" target=""_blank"">the Residents</a> at their most beatific.</p>
<p>There are echoes of other antecedents throughout, particularly the strain of German experimentation known as <i>K</i><i>osmiche Musik</i>. But where Raglani's last widely-distributed release, 2008's<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12307-of-sirens-born/"" target=""_blank""><i> Of Sirens Born</i></a>, felt like a synthesis of his influences, <i>Real Colors</i> bears his own stamp more clearly. That comes across most in its endless pulse, which eternally bubbles and often threatens to burst. His loops feel solid enough to last forever, but never settled or relaxed. Instead, Raglani is always as interested in what his sounds could do next as what they're currently doing.</p>
<p>The final two tracks on <i>Real Colors</i> are significantly shorter-- each lasts just a bit over five minutes-- and less varied than the first two. Where their predecessors were like aural colleges, these pieces are more conventionally song-like. Each begins with an arpeggiated loop that passes through modifications in scale and volume, creating a kind of verse-chorus pattern. ""The Exploded View"" in particular is a bona-fide song, with haunting vocals that follow the synths through cycles of tension and release.</p>
<p>Despite the shift toward contained structure, Raglani makes the second half of the album as restless as its first. Perhaps this is a cleverly-designed after-effect-- once you're immersed in his busy environment, even simple synths can sound ripe with potential. Maybe it's the basic urgency he gives his loops, a skill he's recently honed with Mike Pollard in the excellent duo <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/studentsofdecay/sets/bryter-layter-two-lenses"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bryter Layter</a>. Whatever the reason, <i>Real Colors of the Physical World</i> demonstrates the beguiling versatility of Joseph Raglani's sound-crafting skills.</p></div>"|17378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17378-real-colors-of-the-physical-world/|7.7|Marc Masters

Since he's spent the last few years sharing festival stages with indie rock and electronic acts, it makes some sense that he might want to make a record influenced by indie rock and electronic music. So here on his second proper solo album, he's exchanged the deep, dirty funk of 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14424-sir-lucious-left-foot-the-son-of-chico-dusty/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty</i></a> and his half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/"" target=""_blank"">OutKast's</a> nearly decade-old double solo LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11796-speakerboxxxthe-love-below/"" target=""_blank""><i>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</i></a> for collaborations with artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28373-phantogram/"" target=""_blank"">Phantogram</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27255-wavves/"" target=""_blank"">Wavves</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8133-little-dragon/"" target=""_blank"">Little Dragon</a>.</p>
<p><i>Vicious</i><i> Lies and Dangerous Rumors</i> is on the one hand a genre-busting statement of artistic restlessness but it's also a mess. You can try looking at it from a few different angles: as an outgrowth of rap's artsy ambitions, a compilation of indietronic-rap fusion tied together by one voice, or even simply as the new Big Boi record. But each approach carries its own particular set of frustrations when confronted with the 17-track whole.</p>
<p>Some of its weakest moments are actually the ones with the most potential. Teaming up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a> and Phantogram on ""Lines"", for instance, makes good sense on paper. Rocky's among the most successful of the current crop of upstart boundary-pushing rappers and Phantogram (who contribute to three of the album's tracks) have demonstrated an ability to infuse traditional pop structures with a sonically adventurous spirit. But the finished product refuses to cohere into the quasi-ambient electro-pop-rap gestalt the line-up promises. The rappers' verses and Sarah Barthel's breathy, multi-tracked choruses basically stand politely next to each other without interacting in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>Other questionable team-ups fare much worse, like the lineup of Big Boi, pop-rapper B.o.B., and snotty surf-pop savant Nathan Williams of Wavves on ""Shoes for Running"". The terminally schlocky B.o.B. comes at this potentially challenging collaboration with the same staunchly middle of the road approach he takes to everything, while Williams yelps his way through a hook that would be embarrassingly twee even if it wasn't presented in the context of a rap record. Imagine a weak, more self-consciously indie-fied song from the <i>Judgement Night</i> soundtrack and you're getting there.</p>
<p>The album's saving grace is Big Boi. No matter what setting you place him in, he remains one of the most dextrous, technically capable, and thoroughly entertaining figures in hip-hop. He's still unapologetically lecherous, still styling all over less-smooth fools, still repping for the Dungeon Family and OutKast. (Although the latter trait is starting to seem cruel considering how many people are still holding out hope for a proper sequel to <i>Stankonia</i> and how much more unlikely that possibility seems with every passing year.) He's also still apparently unable to phone in a half-assed verse no matter the circumstances, so at least the flimsiest songs on <i>Vicious Lies</i> still has his performance holding them up, even if there's nothing else helping out.</p>
<p>A few tracks do live up to their potential, and to Big Boi's ambitious vision in general. ""In the A"" brings him together with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4400-ti/"" target=""_blank"">T.I.</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4944-ludacris/"" target=""_blank"">Ludacris</a> over a noisy, chaotic funk beat dripping with wah-wah guitar, siren-like synths, and stripper-pole drums that's got enough of the familiar Big Boi energy to bring its differences into compelling focus. (T.I. and Luda both living up to their habit of delivering their strongest material in cameos on other artists' tracks helps as well.) And the deeply louche ""Raspberries"" upholds Big Boi's reputation for making sex music that sounds like it's being beamed in from several years into the future.</p>
<p>He also clicks with Swedish electro-pop group Little Dragon, who appear on three tracks. ""Descending"" is sweetly sad and atmospheric, with Big Boi and Little Dragon vocalist Yukimi Nagano trading verses over a delicate fingerpicked guitar and a reverb-laden minimalist bit of drum programming straight out of a Prince slow jam. But on ""Higher Res"" and ""Thom Pettie""-- maybe the best cut on the album-- the group shows a surprising facility for producing the kind of booming, nasty beats that suit Big Boi the best. Out of the lengthy list of collaborators on the disappointing <i>Vicious Lies</i>, they're the only ones he should hit up the next time he goes in to record.</p></div>"|17294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17294-vicious-lies-and-dangerous-rumors/|6.1|Miles Raymer

But where the band's 2012 release, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16737-lucifer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lucifer</i></a>, saw that island influence fused into other strains of cosmic head-trip music (60s psychedelia, Krautrock, shoegaze), this follow-up companion piece serves to make the implicit explicit. No false advertising here: <i>Lucifer in Dub</i> does exactly what it says it's going to do, with Aaron Coyes re-engineering Indra Dunis' dreamy pop melodies into echo-plexed incantations while greatly amplifying the percussive clatter we imagined to be percolating beneath the hypnotic haze. But this remix album proves so faithful to its antecedent that it verges on the redundant.</p>
<p>Featuring cheekily titled revisions of six <i>Lucifer</i> songs (while forsaking the album's brief bookend tracks), <i>Lucifer in Dub</i> is more a protraction of its predecessor than a radical reworking. Had the band continued to ride out the tropical grooves of originals ""Cosmic Tides"", ""Live Love"", or ""Midnight (In the Valley of Shadows)"" for another seven minutes, the songs probably would've naturally mutated into what we hear on their equivalents, ""Cosmic Dub"", ""Live Dub"", and ""Midnight Dub"", which closely resemble their respective source tracks in both feel and form, albeit with added textural freakiness and a more aggressive energy bleeding into the productions. But beyond these gradual, subtle enhancements, <i>Lucifer in Dub</i> doesn't afford us much opportunity to see these songs in a new light-- it essentially renders what was already a trippy, amorphous album slightly more trippy and amorphous. Really, the closest this set comes to going off the hook is when the ""Beautiful Son"" redux (""Beautiful Dub"") announces itself with the now antiquated, staccato tone of a phone that needs to be placed back on its receiver.</p>
<p>The musical exploitation of household items is a common dub device, but on <i>Lucifer in Dub</i>, the aforementioned phone effect or the doorbell ringing throughout ""<span>Lo Dub High Dub</span>"" provide a novel means for Coyes and Dunis to obliquely reference the theme of domestic bliss that runs through <i>Lucifer</i>. A little more of that abstract logic could've gone a long way in making <i>Lucifer in Dub</i> a more distinct, stand-alone piece. As it stands, the ideal way to experience this record is to make a playlist pairing off its tracks with their original counterparts, so that each <i>Lucifer</i> song essentially dissolves into its own distended, dubbed-out coda. In its most transfixing moments, <i>Lucifer</i> emitted the sort of soothing, mesmerizing sound that you wish could go on forever-- at the very least, <i>Lucifer in Dub</i> affords us a few more minutes in the service of that ideal.</p></div>"|17429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17429-lucifer-in-dub/|6.6|Stuart Berman

The bassist/leader was the mastermind, but the star was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13109-eric-dolphy/"" target=""_blank"">Eric Dolphy</a>, a virtuosic, modernist-minded improviser on saxophone, bass clarinet, and flute, who was mere months from death due to undiagnosed diabetes at the time of the shows documented here. Collectors know this band well, through various live recordings made in the spring of 64, including a <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xmkfvr_charles-mingus-sextet-oslo-1964-full-version_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">film</a> of the April 12th Oslo show and an exemplary 2007 double-CD set, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10490-cornell-1964/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cornell 1964</i></a>. The first four discs of <i>The Jazz Workshop Concerts</i>-- which compiles five good-to-great-sounding full-show recordings from Mingus's personal archive, three never before issued in their entirety-- present two more shows from this run: April 4 at Town Hall in New York (excerpted on a 1964 LP issued by Mingus's Jazz Workshop label) and April 10 at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam (released on a limited-edition French LP in 1985). Like every showing by the 64 Mingus sextet, these are outstanding performances, but whether you're craving additional versions of a familiar set list depends entirely on your level of fandom. (Mosaic, the label behind <i>The Jazz Workshop Concerts</i>, is a hallowed name among jazz completists; full disclosure: I contributed liner notes to a 2010 Mosaic box focused on avant-garde innovator Henry Threadgill.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">But this set, a commemoration of Mingus's 90th birthday anniversary this past April, also contains assorted other treasures, at least one of which-- a performance from May 1965, less than half of which originally came out on a rare Mingus-released LP called <i>My Favorite Quintet</i>-- feels like its own landmark. It's hard to beat the '64 band, but during the year and a half following Dolphy's death, Mingus didn't let that tragedy slow him down. We hear him here at consecutive Monterey Jazz Festivals (September '64 and '65) and at the May '65 show, presenting ambitious, socially engaged, composer-centric sets. One of <i>The Jazz Workshop Concerts</i>' key pleasures is contrasting the familiar fireworks of the '64 working band with the fascinating odds and ends that follow.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This set is not Mingus 101. If you don't own staples such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13163-mingus-ah-um/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mingus Ah Um</i></a>, <i>Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus</i>, and <i>The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady</i>, <i>The Jazz Workshop Concerts</i> will likely be too specific for your needs. But for listeners interested in taking a long, hard look at a prolific and tumultuous period in this great composer's life, it's well worth the plunge.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Hearing the '64 sextet material found here, it's hard not to focus on the tragedy of Dolphy's impending demise. The multi-instrumental marvel was on an incredible roll that year, having found time to record his own magnum opus, <i>Out to Lunch!</i>, and appear on <i>Point of Departure</i>, a masterpiece by the enigmatic pianist Andrew Hill, amid his commitments to Mingus. But <i>The Jazz Workshop Concerts</i> affords the chance to reassess this lopsided view of the band. It was an incredibly deep group, with each of the other musicians providing a unique texture: the hard-bop brawn of tenor saxist Clifford Jordan, the gentle lyricism of trumpeter Johnny Coles, the prismatic, good-humored splendor of pianist Jaki Byard, the devilishly mutable pulse of drummer Dannie Richmond, and Mingus's own nimble majesty on bass. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Mingus' spring '64 setlists, favoring elastic forms with tons of solo space, seem designed to flatter his sidemen. This is especially evident on the 21-minute Amsterdam version of the Charlie Parker tribute ""Parkeriana"", during which Mingus yanks the rhythm section out from under each soloist in turn. Byard uses his break to bust into one of his patented stride-style jaunts, sounding like an overdriven player piano. Later, Dolphy swoops and yelps in the foreground as Jordan and Coles calmly quote the melody of the Dizzy Gillespie–Frank Paparelli bebop classic ""A Night in Tunisia"", which Mingus had played with Parker and Gillespie at a famed 1953 gig at Toronto's Massey Hall. Moments such as this illustrate one of Mingus's chief imperatives as a bandleader: Honor the past but interrogate it, juxtapose it with the sound of <i>now</i>.   </p>
<p class=""p1"">If ""Parkeriana"" and other fixtures of the '64 sets favor a loose, jammy feel, the centerpiece of these shows, ""Meditations on Integration,"" aims for a very different mood. <i>The Jazz Workshop Concerts</i> features three versions of this sprawling suite, but the one to focus on is the 27-minute Town Hall rendition. This performance, which Mingus dubbed ""Praying with Eric"" on its initial release, is straight-up phenomenal. It isn't just the highlight of the box; it's one of the crown jewels in the Mingus discography. The piece reflected Mingus's appropriately grim view of the contemporary African-American condition-- the only difference between the situation in the South and the Holocaust, Mingus tells the Town Hall audience, being that ""they don't have gas chambers and hot stoves to cook us in yet""-- and that gravity is on full display in the music. Like <i>The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady</i>, it's a programmatic compositional triumph that transcends genre.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Heard after this staggering statement, the '64 Monterey Jazz Festival performance on disc 5, which earned rave reviews at the time, feels comparatively tame. Recorded three months after Dolphy's death, it finds Mingus, Byard, and Richmond regrouping in the company of an alternate frontline-- altoist Charles McPherson, tenorist John Handy and trumpeter Lonnie Hillyer-- and running through familiar material: a medley of pieces by Mingus's idol, Duke Ellington, and ""Orange Was the Color of Her Dress, Then Blue Silk"", a mainstay of the prior sextet's repertoire. There's also a quasi-orchestral version of ""Meditations on Integration"" here, which augments the core band with extra reeds and brass, but even with the added manpower, it can't muster the soul-shaking drama of the Town Hall rendition.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Fortunately, the 1965 material on <i>The Jazz Workshop Concerts</i>-- the <i>My Favorite Quintet</i> performance, also with McPherson and Hillyer, and a brass-heavy octet appearance at that year's Monterey festival-- finds Mingus making conscious forward strides. Old standbys show up in these sets but several of the works are rarities, either duplicated only on a 2006 archival release, <i>At UCLA 1965</i>, or exclusive to this box. ""They Trespass the Land of the Sacred Sioux"" affords a vivid look at the underrated McPherson, who took on the daunting task of replacing Dolphy in the alto-sax role. McPherson plays beautifully on this episodic elegy, soloing first in tandem with flugelhorn player Jimmy Owens and then, at Mingus's urging (""Alto! Alto!""), alone. He hints at his predecessor's keening urgency, while sanding down the spiky edges and adding a touch of old-school romance.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As strong as the September '65 Monterey performance is, <i>My Favorite Quintet</i> (split between discs six and seven) is better. Recorded in Minneapolis in May of '65, this great-sounding document shows how the McPherson/Hillyer group carved out its own identity, distinct from the Dolphy/Jordan/Coles band. The opening track, a long, leisurely rendition of ""So Long Eric"", finds Mingus, Richmond and Byard having a blast prodding Hillyer with dropouts, crescendos, and head-spinning tempo changes, as McPherson contributes big-band-style riffs in the background. The remainder of the concert covers a ton of ground. There's a charmingly retro take on the 1934 standard ""Cocktails for Two"", where McPherson nods to the signature vibrato of New Orleans jazz great Sidney Bechet; an unsettling spoken-word protest piece (""A Lonely Day in Selma, Alabama,"" which segues into the timeless ""Freedom""); a gem of a Mingus piano solo, harking back to the 1963 LP <i>Mingus Plays Piano</i>; a consummately relaxed ""Themeless Blues"" that starts with a slapsticky Mingus/Hillyer duet; and a super-tight sprint through ""Copa City Titty,"" which appears on other Mingus records as ""O.P.""-- a nod to the bassist Oscar Pettiford. (Mingus helpfully informs the audience that ""titty"" was once slang for ""gig,"" and has ""nothing to do with mammaries."") </p>
<p class=""p1"">The stage banter is mostly priceless. Near the end of the show, Mingus asks the audience to boycott his high-profile releases on Columbia, Atlantic, and Impulse, labels which he claims have failed to pay him ample royalties. (He okays RCA Victor exclusively, quipping, ""I imagine, because they make enough money with the atomic bomb, that they don't have to worry about cheating jazz musicians."") Introducing ""Bird Preamble,"" another Charlie Parker tribute, Mingus takes a shot at the then-thriving free-jazz movement: ""This is to sum up an era that some people <i>think</i> they have summed up, [because] they call themselves 'avant-garde.' And I've found that the avant-garde cannot play Bird yet."" As an illustration of the Mingus temperament, both musical and philosophical, the Minneapolis recording is essential.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A hotly contested and sometimes borderline-farcical election year feels like a good time to revisit Charles Mingus' work. He sought to entertain without pandering, to educate without preaching, to mingle the past and present of his art form in alchemical ways. <i>The Jazz Workshop Concerts 1964–65</i> is too focused to serve as a Mingus primer, but it does illustrate these core facets of his aesthetic by zeroing in on a key transitional phase. Just as importantly, it memorializes late, great radicals such as Eric Dolphy and Jaki Byard, while drawing attention to Charles McPherson, an undervalued veteran still with us. Spend good time with these seven discs and Mingus's multifarious genius snaps into crisp focus. </p></div>"|17430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17430-the-jazz-workshop-concerts-196465/|8.4|Hank Shteamer

Instead, he's one of <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1524"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a growing number</a> of noise and experimental artists to discover that loud, hirsute, pulsing beats are a potent way to disorient listeners. Those beats, mixed with a noisenik's abandon, can unearth sound-worlds trad-y producers miss. For instance, ""Dripping"", the opening track on <i>LP</i>, Container's second full-length for Cleveland's Spectrum Spools and the second of his LP's titled <i>LP</i>, features an obscene, high-pitch frequency that sounds a lot like a bird's chirp. Carl Craig never disturbs my dog.</p>
<p>Schofield's part of a sonic dialogue that includes American labels like Future Times, Spectrum Spools, and L.I.E.S. (Long Island Electrical System) that help bridge the gap between noise and dance. Combine that with a renewed interest in analog gear and performance by a generation of European DJs-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29870-blawan/"" target=""_blank"">Blawan</a>, the Analogue Cops, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28130-juju-jordash/"" target=""_blank"">Juju &amp; Jordash</a> among them-- rediscovering techno proper, and you come to see how an unassuming guy who <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1507"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ran a tape label out of his Nashville ranch house</a> comes to be seen as part of a movement.</p>
<p>The pictures in the article linked above, coupled with <i>LP</i>, manage to say something that hundreds of frankly not-that-different-in-the-grand-scheme-of-things records from Berlin and London don't: that techno can be sloppy, unordered, punk, and, above all, casual. That it can have fuck-all to do with geometry and design and clubbing until 8 a.m. the next morning. (Schofield's live sets are reportedly short, intense, and shrill.) Precious, homey metaphors are too easy to apply to <i>LP</i>, so take your pick: lumpy mashed potatoes, a wobbly stool, an askance picture frame.</p>
<p>The best part about <i>LP</i>, though, is that it isn't precious at all. It's wily and sharp and thoughtfully brief. Schofield doesn't bother too much with traditional melodies and basslines, but he's more orderly than peers like Frak (true weirdos) or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30088-pete-swanson/"" target=""_blank"">Pete Swanson</a> (a nihilist in comparison). ""Perforate"" actually sounds quite a bit like Drexciya, both in its curt, iridescent palpitations and its blank-stare vocal repetitions: ""<i>Per</i>/for/ate...<i>Per</i>/for/ate."" Schofield uses up 80% of applicable adjectives just naming his songs: ""Dissolve"", ""Rattler"", ""Dripping"". They're tags that any techno beginner would think up: succinct, memorable, and descriptive. The tracks build, but not for too long, and avoid snowballing into big noisy messes. The exception is the closing track, ""Refract"", which unleashes a spanking, double-time rhythmic blast that will absolutely cane your speakers.</p>
<p>Schofield, of course, is not really exploring frequencies or structures heretofore unknown to techno. Above all else, Schofield offers an outsider's perspective, and it's one he's not afraid to lean on in deference to a genre's monolithic history. <i>LP</i> is efficient, prickly, and noticeable, or not much like modern techno at all. That he is operating like this at the same time many others are is a boon, for us, so long as he keeps his blinders on.</p></div>"|17481.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17481-lp/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

It's not that they're unambitious: Over those four years, frontman Dan Reeves and brothers Oliver and Patrick Fisher have worked on mastering and refining the seam of fluid but bristling, colorless post-punk they share with Women, which manifests on their debut album, <i>Persistent Malaise</i>. But while perfecting the kind of jam that could bowl along forever with scree and smoke in its wake, things outside the band inevitably fell apart.</p>
<p>In an interview with the band Sauna Youth, Patrick confessed that ""the lyrical directness of our album unfortunately follows the thematic focus of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a>'s debut (minus the cabin)."" Fisher's intense heartbreak called for more thorough lyrical treatment than the shallow vagaries he had lent to their past work. On <i>Persistent Malaise</i>, his lines are meticulously structured, excavating old times so that he might torture himself by staring clean at them. ""Our past seems angled to support what has bloomed/ But pillow talk, it should not be exhumed/ For what I whispered, I would never recoup/ I'm not so bitter, just a crystalline loop,"" he yelps on ""Fog Cutter"", over a thick, smoggy riff that's perpetually climbing peaks, sounding at its best like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9824-cryptograms/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cryptograms</i></a> offcut.</p>
<p>The album toes the line between tension and ambience, exploring the strain inherent in stasis. The siren-like guitar interplay of ""Sherry Island"" is overshot with a near-euphoric wave of warm drone, while Fisher's lyrics chronicle a Halloween party where the guests' obfuscating masks only serve to make him realize how distant he was from them in the first place. ""Variety Lights"" is the album's only instrumental, ticking between dank and trebly like two hypnotic shades of an animated .gif. On ""This Modernist Crown"", Fisher is subject to several layers of emotional and physical paralysis-- ""I wake up tired for still I'm dreaming of you""-- as a warped, queasy cloud of feedback gives way to  the record's only guitar solo, and a rare bout of smashing, all-out aggression.</p>
<p>While emotional inertia forms the backbone of <i>Persistent Malaise</i>, Cold Pumas' debut is also a testament to honing one's craft before presenting it to the world. Its sureness and subtlety say more than a few gauche early pullquotes, and although Cold Pumas undoubtedly won't sound the same forever, their commitment to consistency has already served them admirably.</p></div>"|17355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17355-persistent-malaise/|7.4|Laura Snapes

As he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41848-5-10-15-20-flying-lotus/"">explained</a> to Pitchfork last year, ""I feel like I'm hip-hop's fucking weird step-child and they don't want to see me."" When talking about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a> in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/37567-flying-lotus-talks-new-lp-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">an earlier interview</a>, he asked for some impromptu A&amp;R help: ""I just want to get on a mixtape… You know him? Hook it up, man!"" Later, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a>'s state-of-the-art, big-money solo record inspired him to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43036-echo-chamber-flying-lotus-vs-big-sean/"">tweet</a>, ""Oh rap.. You used to be such a beautiful bitch, now look at you.. Look at you!"" Poor guy couldn't even get it together with a relatively accessible dude like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"">Tyler, the Creator</a> and he lives in the same city: ""I don't know what it is, but they ain't fucking kicking my door down."" His <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8919-flying-lotus/"">candor</a> has been refreshing and also frustrating: This isn't some chump using Soundcloud comments to drop links to his beat tapes. What's stopping him from actually making a Flying Lotus hip-hop record?</p>
<p class=""p1"">In a sense, we still don't know. The previously anonymous rap entity <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30595-captain-murphy/"">Captain Murphy</a> has since been revealed as Steven Ellison, but the project doesn't extend the aesthetic of Flying Lotus albums into the rap realm. Instead, it's lowbrow, heavy-lidded, and charmingly giddy about its love for all things Wu-Tang, Odd Future, and Stones Throw. If you can get past the fact that it doesn't change the game or even try to, you can see it for what it is: one of the best hip-hop albums to come out of any of those camps in 2012.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While Captain Murphy will be seen as a side project, it still feels like the product of a FlyLo-level work ethic. But the process is inverted: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12132-los-angeles/""><i>Los Angeles</i></a><i>, </i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14198-cosmogramma/""><i>Cosmogramma </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17115-until-the-quiet-comes/""><i>Until the Quiet Comes </i></a>each constitute 45 or so minutes of impossibly dense music delivered as a single piece meant to be consumed in one sitting. <i>Duality </i>is far more even-keeled and is presented as a sum of easily segmented, constituent parts. The deluxe mixtape changes artwork with every track, enhancing its interactive, Viewfinder-like feel.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Ellison handles the majority of the production, along with Brainfeeder associates like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29245-teebs/"">Teebs</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22490-samiyam/"">Samiyam</a>, who forego the astral jazz and to dig in the same crates where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">Dilla</a> got their fingers dusty. If a sample sounded a little too vigorous for beanbag chair repose, it didn't make the cut. Everything's subsumed under such a thick cloud of weed smoke that even higher profile guests like Just Blaze and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"">Earl Sweatshirt</a> simply take their rightful place in the puff-puff-pass procedure. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Much of <i>Duality</i>'s initial intrigue lies in Ellison's rapping; you can't help wondering what he sounds like and what he's going to rap about now that he's finally decided to take the mic. It's filled with morally casual lines like ""It's getting real late now, delivery DiGiorno/ Either fuck a fat bitch or I'mma settle for this porno"" and couplets that conflate blowjob jokes with ""Dragonball Z"" references like a latter day Bobby Digital.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This aspect gave credence to the persistent rumor that Captain Murphy was actually Tyler, the Creator going incognito in his laziest publicity stunt yet (yes, even more so than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44100-odd-future-pull-friday-prank/"">Young Nigga</a>). And yes, the most common vocal filter Ellison employs makes him sound almost <i>exactly </i>like Tyler. It's particularly apparent when Ellison stammers through multi-syllable thickets of softcore shock tactics such as ""Bitches love it when I'm fuckin' rough and stuff/ Hate to see me drunk walkin' like I'm Snuffleufagus,"" and ""Captain known to choke a blonde/ Does she like it?/ No doubt even though she cryin'/ Oh wow, simmer down I only kinda mean it.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">But with hindsight, you can certainly see Ellison leaving a breadcrumb trail to his true identity. On ""Children of the Atom"", he snarls ""Two Grammys on my wishlist/ I blame it on my fans,"" a likely nod at his <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/flyinglotus/status/10221047701835778"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rant</a> against being shut out for <i>Cosmogramma.</i> One of his introductory tracks, ""Between Friends"", ends with a slightly-skewed Brainfeeder shout-out, and on ""The Killing Joke"", he boasts ""Labels tryin' to sign me/ Speculating my identity/ Good luck, you'll never find me."" This is one of the most respected beatmakers and label heads out there, but recasting himself as an anonymous but suspiciously cosigned rapper probably got more people interested than ""Flying Lotus raps now.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">While the relentlessly active pitch-shifting and stereo panning is meant to render Ellison as some kind of hallucinogenic voice projection, <i>Duality </i>proves that he's the best rapper on his own label. Check the motormouthed, Busta Rhymes-style onomatopoeia on ""Mighty Morphin Foreskin"" or ""Drive Thru"", which seems modeled after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"">Das Racist</a>'s loopy ""People Are Strange"". His voice is constantly in motion and the lyrics are subtly rife with clever wordplay, incidental sound effects, and bawdy jokes. In fact, it's only when conventionally personified Brainfeeder rappers like Jeremiah Jae and Azizi Gibson show up that <i>Duality </i>feels pedestrian.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That is, unless you think a very good weed-rap tape is pedestrian by default. Ellison's work as Flying Lotus tends to inspire lofty comparisons-- Aphex Twin, Dilla and of course, his own Coltrane lineage. So anything under that name that doesn't feel like a statement will register as a lesser work. But what about the Flying Lotus who performs live with a bottle of Jameson and a laptop full of TNGHT, Waka Flocka Flame, and Schoolboy Q bangers? This isn't FlyLo's long-threatened Dirty South beat tape and it's probably not something that will make Kanye West reach out to him. But make no mistake, this record is <i>fun </i>in a way that Flying Lotus records choose not to be and satisfying in a way that most of his peers' fail to be.</p></div>"|17482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17482-duality/|8.0|Ian Cohen

There's Eddie from <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088184/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Stranger Than Paradise</i></a>, played by former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> drummer Richard Edson, whose weatherworn existence revolved around placing bets at the dog track. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165798/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ghost Dog</i></a> deposited an ice cream salesman played by Isaach De Bankolé as the best friend of the titular character. The musical choices for Jarmusch's films, so often pivotal to the action, reflect his decision to cast Hollywood stars alongside relative unknowns. The <i>Broken Flowers</i> soundtrack featured contributions from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulatu_Astatke"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mulatu Astatke</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"">Marvin Gaye</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30405-sleep/"">Sleep</a>. His forthcoming vampire feature, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1714915/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Only Lovers Left Alive</i></a>, will pull another musician out of the shadows, with Dutch lutist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30210-jozef-van-wissem/"">Jozef Van Wissem</a> providing music for the film. <i>The Mystery of Heaven</i> is the pair's third musical collaboration this year, following <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16306-concerning-the-entrance-into-eternity/""><i>Concerning the Entrance Into Eternity</i></a> (on <a href=""http://importantrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Important</a>) and <i>Apokatastasis </i>(on Van Wissem's own <a href=""http://incunabulumrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Incunabulum</a> label).</p>
<p>The story of how this duo met, in a chance meeting on a New York City street, where Van Wissem pushed a CD into Jarmusch's hand, feels like it was pulled directly from one of the director's movies. The music they make together retains certain tenets of those films, too. There's a strong sense of magic and mystery, all delivered with a beautiful simplicity. If you strip away the stylistic heft of Jarmusch's films, there are often deceptively basic human emotions underpinning the narrative, albeit ones revealed through the eyes of emotionally damaged individuals. The tracks on <i>The Mystery of Heaven</i> reach down to the same spot, as told through Van Wissem's forlorn lute playing and Jarmusch's feedback-addled guitar parts. Their only diversion is to employ actress (and <i>Only Lovers</i> star) Tilda Swinton to provide a stern spoken word passage over ""The More She Burns the More Beautifully She Glows"".</p>
<p>Much of this record is a gentle advance on the ideas of <i>Concerning the Entrance Into Eternity</i>, with Jarmusch again taking a back seat to Van Wissem's lead. It's a meditative piece, and one that passes naturally from bristly, repetitive motifs (""Flowing Light of the Godhead"") to more subdued material (""The Mystery of Heaven""). Even when they reach peak noise, about two thirds of the way through ""Flowing Light"", it's more hypnotic than aggressive. This is material with a firmly contemplative edge to it, casting a spell only broken with the occasional fluffed note or lapse into accidental dissonance. There's a definite sense that this was recorded live and with little practice beforehand. The title track feels sloppy and aimless at times, perhaps deliberately so. But this is music that benefits from a certain amount of discipline, such as the feral splendor of ""The More She Burns"", where the pair sync up perfectly following Swinton's wonderfully haughty vocal.</p>
<p>The fact that Jarmusch worked on this album with an actress and musician involved in his next movie makes this feel like an important step toward that project. There's even a filmic feel to some of the work here, particularly in the two versions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14325-etimasia/"">""Etimasia""</a>, which echo with a lonely, lovelorn ambiance. It makes sense that Jarmusch would want to break away from music that could superficially resemble ""soundtrack"" work, and he mostly has achieved that on his various collaborations with Van Wissem. But the versions of ""Etimasia"" on <i>The Mystery of Heaven</i> shift closer to a place in which he's become more comfortable since his nascent musical efforts in the no wave scene. It's one of stark, pensive thought, populated by characters who don't make connections easily, whose attempts to make sense of the world are largely a solitary pursuit. At its best, this music feeds into a similar sentiment, pushing close to the kind of deep introspection at the heart of Jarmusch's films.</p></div>"|17480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17480-the-mystery-of-heaven/|6.4|Nick Neyland

""What's next?"", one might ask. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2700-mates-of-state/"" target=""_blank"">Mates of State</a> perform Anita Baker's <i>Rapture</i>?"" Anyone who's followed the Rosebuds' career for the past decade knows that there's a bit more logic to such an idea, though. Since titling their 2003 debut <i>The Rosebuds Make Out</i>, Ivan Howard and Kelly Crisp have structured their recording career around the ups and downs of their personal relationship, culminating with 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15505-loud-planes-fly-low/"" target=""_blank""><i>Loud Planes Fly Low</i></a>, the duo's first LP after their divorce and agreement to continue their creative partnership. Offered as a free download on their <a href=""http://therosebuds.bandcamp.com/album/love-deluxe-the-rosebuds-perform-sade"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> site, <i>Love Deluxe-- </i>more or less a Howard solo project abetted by Rosebuds collaborators-- is a kind gesture and loving 20th anniversary tribute.</p>
<p>This much is obvious: no one else can be Sade. Over the past decade, even <i>Sade</i> can only be Sade every eight to 10 years-- the group is not exactly known for its prolificacy. Still, the band's sumptuous, smooth music shows no signs of wear, even subjected to the withering winds of musical fashion cycles. If anything, much of the original <i>Love Deluxe</i> still sounds relevant today, particularly given the admiring updates to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/underscore/8822-quiet-storm-tk-tk-tk/"">Quiet Storm</a> sound by any number of acolytes given positive reviews on this website. Perhaps the greatest compliment to pay the Rosebuds' cover of <i>Love Deluxe</i> is that it's not necessary to have any familiarity with the original to enjoy its remake-- Howard knows his limits, and successfully folds the smooth R&amp;B original into a DIY indie mindset; like applying a martial rhythm to ""Kiss of Life"" or substituting sax for piano on ""I Couldn't Love You More"", nodding toward <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"" target=""_blank"">Destroyer</a>'s soft-rock Merge opus <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kaputt</i></a>. Even millennial Merge fans who confuse <a href=""http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/Debbieese/sade1985.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sade</a> with the ladies <a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lpy6p2XB_cc/TnHwnuLaFfI/AAAAAAAAD-Q/_hmhn48WCPA/s1600/addicted%2Bto%2Blove.png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">from the Robert Palmer video</a> can enjoy this album on its own merits.</p>
<p>Several original tracks receive minimal adjustments from Howard-- he knows better than to mess with the classic 1-2 opening combo of ""No Ordinary Love"" and ""Feel No Pain"", save for some slight alterations of phrasing, a much dryer mix, and the addition of blocky live drums, which translates ""Pain""'s minimal island blues into something more akin to indie rock. ""Pearls"", on the other hand, remains as much a treacly bit of social commentary today as two decades ago, not improved in the slightest by a white dude crooning about a ""woman in Somalia."" Howard has dabbled in indie R&amp;B via participation in the Jagjaguwar supergroup <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28643-gayngs/"" target=""_blank"">Gayngs</a>, but his voice much more closely recalls James Mercer's nebbish earnestness than Luther Vandross or James Ingram.

Cheryl Cole, Sarah Harding, Nadine Coyle, Nicola Roberts, and Kimberley Walsh were put together on the reality show <i>Popstars: The Rivals</i> in 2002, and they proceeded to score 20 consecutive British Top 10 singles over the next seven years. That series of hits may well be their legacy, despite the fact that they've reunited for four new songs on this retrospective, their second greatest hits compilation to date.</p>
<p>The most obvious comparison for Girls Aloud is, of course, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8162-spice-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Spice Girls</a>: cheerful! Euro! girl-power-y! But it might be a little more accurate to compare them to the mid-60s-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11827-the-supremes/"" target=""_blank"">Supremes</a>, a group whose presence is all about charm and restraint, and whose behind-the-scenes powerhouse is a brilliantly original writing and production team. In roughly the same way that the Supremes of the period from ""Where Did Our Love Go"" to ""Reflections"" were the vocal adjuncts to Holland-Dozier-Holland, Girls Aloud are basically the most prominent performing associates of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10445-xenomania/"" target=""_blank"">Xenomania</a>, the UK song-factory collective centered on Brian Higgins.</p>
<p>Xenomania has cranked out dozens of European hits over the past 15 years, for acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne/"" target=""_blank"">Pet Shop Boys</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5030-sugababes/"" target=""_blank"">Sugababes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2782-kylie-minogue/"" target=""_blank"">Kylie Minogue</a>. They don't exactly have a signature sound, although they do have a signature songwriting style, which seems to consist of writing a lot of songs, then chopping them up into pieces, keeping the catchiest parts, and seeing which ones can be sutured together into new songs. The best Xenomania songs tend to come off like miraculously coordinated mini-suites; the second-rank ones sound more like ""Stars on 45""-style medleys.</p>
<p>Girls Aloud, as it happens, got a lot of the best ones. The utterly wonderful ""Biology"" starts with a Chicago electric blues riff, of all things; that gets supplanted by a string of increasingly amazing Eurotechno melodies, the last of which-- the nominal chorus, which finally shows up two minutes in-- somehow transforms itself straight back into the blues riff again. ""Biology"" also features one of the proud Britishisms that are all over their records: ""We're gonna cause a conTROversy,"" Coyle wails. ""The Loving Kind"", which Pet Shop Boys co-wrote with Xenomania, pulls off another one by rhyming its title with ""disinclined.""</p>
<p>As you might expect, Xenomania grab hooks wherever they can find them, and another other way of listening to Girls Aloud's hits is to try to catch all the allusions to the past 50 years' worth of pop as they whizz by. ""Love Machine""-- no relation to either the Miracles' or Morning Musume's respective hits called ""Love Machine""-- borrows its groove from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"" target=""_blank"">the Smiths' </a><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SEkmLVw_UE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rusholme Ruffians""</a>, its chorus melody from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"" target=""_blank"">the Beatles'</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVtHztdkrnU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Baby You're a Rich Man""</a>, and a stray lyric from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16437-frankie-goes-to-hollywood/"" target=""_blank"">Frankie Goes to Hollywood's</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXWVpcypf0w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Two Tribes""</a>, for starters. It also contains one of their funniest lines: ""We're gift-wrapped kitty cats/ We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back.""</p>
<p>The big difference between the 00s-style song machine and that of the 60s is that-- at least for Xenomania's strain of pop-- it's no longer important to make a song's lyrics sketch out a narrative or emotional state. Xenomania's cut-and-paste method often means that Girls Aloud's lyrics, as smoothly as they scan, are vestigial or incoherent. Compare ""No Good Advice"" with the Supremes' song on a similar theme of parental warnings, ""You Can't Hurry Love"", and stray lines that don't really belong start to poke out of the Girls Aloud record: ""I don't need no special fix to anesthetize me""? ""I dig the music that I'm making, baby, and I'll break it into your brain""?</p>
<p>That's a quibble, though. The broader fault of <i>Ten</i> is that it isn't the <i>ABBA Gold</i>-caliber wonder that Girls Aloud deserves as a greatest hits collection. The group's pointless covers of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3485-the-pretenders/"" target=""_blank"">the Pretenders'</a> ""I'll Stand By You"" and the Pointer Sisters' ""Jump"" were big British hits, but they already sound more dated than anything else here. Then there are the new songs, only two of them Xenomania-written. The group's comeback single, ""Something New"", is a game approximation of the Girls Aloud of seven years ago. But the others just drag the album down-- ""Beautiful Cause You Love Me"", in particular, belongs on the same icky-valentine shelf as James Blunt's ""You're Beautiful"".</p>
<p>Momentum is everything for this kind of pop act, and the fact that the one-year break Girls Aloud announced in 2009 turned into three years off suggests that the group isn't the top priority for its members (or for Xenomania) any more. Four of them have embarked on solo careers to varying degrees of success (and Harding's debut album is due in 2013). They may have a second wave in them, perhaps an equivalent of the Supremes' ""Stoned Love"", ""Nathan Jones"", ""Floy Joy"" era. The virtue of Girls Aloud's best songs, though, is that the next part is always even better than the one you're listening to until, suddenly, they're over.</p></div>"|17467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17467-ten/|7.0|Douglas Wolk

Last summer, Liza Thorn and Matthew Koshak released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13845-no-good/"" target=""_blank"">""No Good""</a>, a dusty slow-burner that reveled in its own negative space, hanging in mid-air with a mix of wonder and fear that was easy to see potential in. Never minding their handle, the old <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24033-mazzy-star/"" target=""_blank"">Mazzy Star</a> comparisons still came easily, but thanks to some lucky timing, ""No Good"" managed to fill a more immediate void. Right as the song began to prick up ears, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30840-christopher-owens/"" target=""_blank"">Christopher Owens</a>-- frontman of San Francisco's madly beloved <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1826-girls/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Girls</a>-- announced that he'd be leaving his band behind. So while Starred's brokenhearted curiosity regarding the darker corners of pop had the Girls comparisons coming easily, too, there was more connecting the two acts than many realized.</p>
<p>Before there was a Girls, there was Curls, which consisted of then-lovers Owens and Thorn. Though both the band and the relationship didn't last, the pair had clearly rubbed off on each other. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11534-lust-for-life/"" target=""_blank"">""Lust For Life""</a>, one of the most notable indie pop songs from the past couple years and Owens' first real songwriting credit, <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2009/09/21/feature-girls/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">was written about Thorn</a>-- suntan, pizza, bottle of wine and all. Now with their <i>Prison to Prison</i> EP, Starred find themselves in a position to win over some of those dejected Girls' fans, and interested parties are most certainly paying attention.</p>
<p>And well they should be. <i>Prison to Prison</i> is a satisfying, intriguing batch of songs that are far more engaging than the simple parts they're made of would suggest. Melancholic and druggy and often surprisingly straightforward, Starred are capable of evoking the same kind of vulnerability that made much of Girls' music so compelling, but in noticeably different ways. <i>Prison to Prison</i> offers both lullabied acoustics that impart a desolate country feel, countoured by spurts of post-punk and psych-rock to create music that by all accounts should float right past you, but instead registers as surprisingly urgent. The results are often a little mixed, but almost always attention-grabbing in some capacity.</p>
<p>Single ""LA Drugs"" and ""Committee"" sit right in the middle of the EP, and function as the most stylistically even-handed pieces. Both hover in ways that could read as anchor-less or simply unspectacular, but are always grounded by the off-putting hum of an organ or a jag of lightning scorched guitar (techniques that feel spiritually akin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29348-ema/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">EMA</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15386-past-life-martyred-saints/"" target=""_blank""><i>Past Life Martyred Saints</i></a>, though employed not quite as effectively). Even with the wattage cranked up a few notches, like on the sleazy-pretty ""Sure Bet"", there's still a balance at work that sidesteps some obvious pitfalls (in this case, an easy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2288-the-kills/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Kills</a> rip-off) and offers something more dynamic.</p>
<p>Bookends ""Call From Paris"" and ""Light"" highlight yet another one of Starred's strengths. A few years ago, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=0DYHnlcpvQ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a video surfaced of Courtney Love</a> in a hotel room, singing a cover of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BUeO5YGF2Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Unsatisfied""</a> while to putting her make-up on in the mirror. Accompanied by only an acoustic guitar, it's both obviously unhinged and unexpectedly kind of great. Despite being far more carefully crafted and purposefully pretty, it's hard not to hear some of that rendition in these two tracks. Over the course of six songs, Thorn's vocals range from muttered to hushed to honeyed, but it's on ""Call From Paris"" and ""Light"" that these tiny resemblances to Love become a little more clear. ""It's everything you do, making all of these lies true,"" she sings on ""Paris"" with a bit of a rasp, placing a subtle snarl on the word ""lies."" ""Light"" is even more contextually telling, as she sings, ""Someone in my light, and he's taking it all."" It's not hard to venture a guess at who that's pointed at, ripe with shades of betrayal and delusion and bitterness that feel all but too familiarly lipstick-smeared.</p>
<p>So suffice it to say that <i>Prison to Prison</i> is a pretty scatterbrained affair in spite of these songs' relatively streamlined structures. But unlike other bands-in-progress, Starred make their varied hat-donnings an asset. Instead of wading into these cloudy pools too deeply, Thorn and Koshak highlight the disparate parts of their musical personalities instead, making pretty music sound frequently maddened and elegantly defeated. Yet it goes without saying that they're at their best when everything falls into place, and you're able to peek into a potentially brighter near-future. That preview comes in the form of ""Cemetery"", a song that's warm and desperate in a way that recalls a folky, aqueous take on <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x269lp_the-jesus-and-mary-chain-just-like_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Just Like Honey""</a>. Still, Starred are in the process of trying to figure exactly who they want to be, and that's perfectly fine. With songs as good as some of the ones on <i>Prison to Prison</i> are, they've earned themselves a little time.</p></div>"|17447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17447-prison-to-prison-ep/|6.8|Zach Kelly

Even genre godfather <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a> is developing a new legacy by releasing some of the best songs of his life. It seems like only <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27948-memory-tapes/"" target=""_blank"">Memory Tapes</a>, aka Dayve Hawk, failed to rise to the occasion, following up the excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13451-seek-magic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Seek Magic </i></a>with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15582-player-piano/"" target=""_blank"">Player Piano</a>, </i>a collection of wan indie rock that seemed like an attempt to backdoor a revival of his previous trad-alt band Hail Social.</p>
<p>But then again, as a 30-something father and music industry vet, he was an outlier among the Urban Outfitters set to begin with. And if there's any silver lining to <i>Player Piano</i>, it's that the prolific and hermetic Hawk is free to do whatever the hell he wants without expectations. Last year, he hinted at a batch of Black Sabbath-esque dirges. Which is certainly intriguing and also about a billion miles away from the meandering pop of <i>Grace/Confusion</i>.</p>
<p>The most immediately striking aspect of Memory Tapes' third proper LP is the tracklisting: It's only six songs long and the shortest cut is just shy of five minutes; nominal lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14367-sheila/"" target=""_blank"">""Sheila""</a> clocks in at about eight and a half. This seems daunting until you remember <i>Seek Magic </i>had only eight songs and, besides his unquestionable peak <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11320-bicycle/"" target=""_blank"">""Bicycle""</a>, its strengths lay in lengthier dance-leaning numbers like ""Stop Talking"" and ""Graphics"". So <i>Grace/Confusion </i>is certainly not the pop record <i>Player Piano </i>was. Here, Hawk employs a watercolor palette to his benefit: Despite its unnerving chorus, ""I watch you sleep,"" the first half of ""Neighborhood Watch"" is given to the sounds of bleary sunrises, loosely strummed acoustics, and distant harmonies. Likewise, the brisk and perky ""Thru the Field"" is ""Bicycle""-gone-<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4556-tour-de-france-soundtracks/"" target=""_blank"">Tour de France</a>, </i>while the first half of ""Sheila"" unifies two prominent artistic memes by sounding like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango_in_the_Night"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Tango in the Night </i></a>dubbed onto VHS. That constitutes about half of <i>Grace/Confusion</i>, likely the ""grace"" part.</p>
<p>Hawke has called this record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48705-stream-the-new-memory-tapes-lp-graceconfusion/"" target=""_blank"">""messier""</a> than his previous work. But with the exception of the strikingly distorted coda of ""Neighborhood Watch"" (maybe that's where the Sabbath fix went?), most of <i>Grace/Confusion</i> pads out past four minutes by establishing a foothold before softly pivoting towards a far less interesting destination. And the immersion demanded by <i>Grace/Confusion </i>is undermined by Hawk's drizzly production; as an avid remixer, you'd hope he would be more accommodating to some outside input or at least an upgrade in gear. The same tones and textures that worked for ""Bicycle"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11475-plain-material/"" target=""_blank"">""Plain Material""</a> are unnecessarily restrictive in a format that requires more depth and dynamic range. And while it casts a nice spell during the earliest hours when your day is either beginning or ending, lifestyle depending, it's ultimately interrupted by Hawk's proclivity for chintzy sound effects; the second half of ""Thru the Field"" trails off into a wheedling, harmonized guitar solo; ""Neighborhood Watch"" breaks its tense grind with overeager synth lines, and Hawk bisects ""Sheila"" with a garish laser beam like some sort of supervillain ploy.</p>
<p>While <i>Grace/Confusion </i>may lean too heavily on Hawk's production, it's a hair better than <i>Player Piano.</i> But it's hard to call it an ""improvement"" or ""progression"" considering it's hardly outside the scope of what Memory Tapes has done so far. In a sense his artistic trajectory seems to be working in reverse-- <i>Seek Magic </i>feels like it should be the culmination of what he's done separately on <i>Player Piano </i>and now <i>Grace/Confusion</i>, not the starting point. So it's hard to take Hawk at his word as he once again claims that his next record will sound nothing like <i>Grace/Confusion</i>; without some true commitment to a sonic reconfiguration, his gift/curse is that it'll probably still sound like something he's already done.</p></div>"|17393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17393-graceconfusion/|6.2|Ian Cohen

In a less direct way, though, that description could just as easily apply to the London group's entire discography. Landmark albums like 1991's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13058-foxbase-alpha-continental/"" target=""_blank""><i>Foxbase Alpha</i></a>, 1993's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13462-so-tough-sound-of-water/"" target=""_blank""><i>So Tough</i></a>, and 1994's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14255-tiger-bay-finisterre/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tiger Bay</i></a> combine a connoisseur's stylish adventurousness with a true fan's endearingly quaint romanticism. Whether 1960s girl groups, 90s Euro-house, or state-of-2012 electro-pop, Saint Etienne aren't ones to let shiny prettiness go to waste.</p>
<p>The last two entries in Saint Etienne's four-year deluxe series make for one hell of a victory lap. <i>Casino Classics</i>, an update of a 1996 remix collection, and <i>Lipslide</i>, singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/850-sarah-cracknell/"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Cracknell's</a> 1997 solo debut, are both far more than the afterthoughts such phrases might suggest. Each vividly represent Saint Etienne's far-flung interests-- their cosmopolitan, dance-oriented side and their more domestic, Burt Bacharach-leaning side-- though not necessarily the one you might think. Most importantly, diehard Saint Etienne fans who've already picked up all of the other reissues have no reason to stop here, and curious newcomers shouldn't have to feel daunted, either.</p>
<p><i>Casino Classics</i> would be notable for historical reasons alone, but happily its top-notch remixers-- and top-notch remix material-- still easily hold their own in this post-EDM era. As a group whose first single, and first hit, converted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young's</a> ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" into dubby Eurodisco, Saint Etienne have never been strangers to the dance realm, and the original 2xCD, 3xLP release was both stacked and prescient. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"" target=""_blank"">The Chemical Brothers'</a> distinctively block-rocking take on <i>Tiger Bay</i>'s krautrock-sleek standout ""Like a Motorway"", for instance, came out here the same month a little song called ""Setting Sun"" hit UK No. 1. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4418-underworld/"" target=""_blank"">Underworld's</a> sprawling space-out on the bass riff from the same album's wordless ""Cool Kids of Death"" just after <i>Trainspotting</i>-famous ""Born Slippy .NUXX"" made its own rise up the charts.</p>
<p>The complete reissue, including two limited-edition bonus discs, adds more than 30 tracks to the original, though nothing from this year's <i>Words and Music</i>. As unwieldy as this approach is for listening all the way through, which I can't recommend trying, it's a smart way of making as much quality material available to fans as possible, and it offers plenty to cherry-pick. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin's</a> two 1993-era appearances-- an Eastern-tinged disemboweling of non-album single ""Who Do You Think You Are"" (a cover with its own intriguing history), and its glitchy, textured B-side-- aren't exactly typical ""dance"" music, but they're enveloping glimpses of an artist who hadn't yet released <i>Selected Ambient Works Volume II</i>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"" target=""_blank"">Broadcast's</a> eerily cinematic ""Angel"" remix came out before the English outfit's first Warp compilation.</p>
<p>Among the new additions, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28150-tiesto/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Tiësto's</a> remix of ""Action,"" originally from 2002's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14255-tiger-bay-finisterre/"" target=""_blank""><i>Finisterre</i></a>, captures the song's return-to-the-clubs feeling-- and also captures Tiësto before he started raking in a reported $22 million annually. And <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3626-richard-x/"" target=""_blank"">Richard X's</a> reworking of ""Method of Modern Love"", the only all-new song from Saint Etienne's 2009 best-of compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12282-london-conversations-the-best-of-saint-etienne/"" target=""_blank""><i>London Conversations</i></a> and one he produced and co-wrote only amps up his subject's ur-pop pleasures, something like his wonderful remix of Cassie's recent ""King of Hearts"". When you throw in a couple of the preexisting comp's standout tracks, such as a breathtaking reworking of <i>Tiger Bay</i> Eurodisco-mainliner ""He's on the Phone"" by Motiv 8 (who did an excellent remix of Spice Girl's ""Wannabe"" around the same time) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5864-andrew-weatherall/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Weatherall's</a> dub-exploring revamp of ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"", it's instructive that so much of what might seem like a leftfield digression for Saint Etienne also underscores their pop charms.</p>
<p>Cracknell's solo <i>Lipslide</i> might seem like the opposite of a remix album, but it winningly isn't so different after all. Like the remixers, Cracknell is making Saint Etienne's songs her own, though unlike them she does so in a style that's not unlike the group's usual approach. After all, she didn't sing on Saint Etienne's first singles, and in a trio with the former music journalists Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs, her role must've been easy for a sometimes chauvinistic critical establishment to discount unfairly. Recorded between her main outfit's masterful electro-folk hybrid <i>Tiger Bay</i> and 1998's Swedish indie pop-indebted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14848-good-humor-tales-from-turnpike-house/"" target=""_blank""><i>Good Humor</i></a>, <i>Lipslide</i> asserts Cracknell's rockist bona fides in the least rockist way possible: She co-writes every song, but they're are unabashedly soft and quotidian, decked out in synths and strings rather than muscular guitars or middlebrow approximations of depth. It's the supposedly interchangeable vocalist reaffirming that the supposedly interchangeable is what really matters anyway.</p>
<p>The 2xCD deluxe edition might surprise some US listeners by mainly restoring the alternate, UK tracklist for the main disc; while a couple of the US-only tracks, such as ""Aussie Soap Girl"", find their way to the bonus disc, not all do. That's probably for the best, as the original lineup makes for a more cohesive listen.

The album doesn't completely follow the UK tracklist, either, as the baggier UK album version of ""Home"" makes a welcome appearance on the bonus disc. Saint Etienne fans, like Smiths fans, are used to trawling through an overly complicated discography, and they do so because the rewards continue to be worth the search.</p>

In a less direct way, though, that description could just as easily apply to the London group's entire discography. Landmark albums like 1991's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13058-foxbase-alpha-continental/"" target=""_blank""><i>Foxbase Alpha</i></a>, 1993's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13462-so-tough-sound-of-water/"" target=""_blank""><i>So Tough</i></a>, and 1994's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14255-tiger-bay-finisterre/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tiger Bay</i></a> combine a connoisseur's stylish adventurousness with a true fan's endearingly quaint romanticism. Whether 1960s girl groups, 90s Euro-house, or state-of-2012 electro-pop, Saint Etienne aren't ones to let shiny prettiness go to waste.</p>
<p>The last two entries in Saint Etienne's four-year deluxe series make for one hell of a victory lap. <i>Casino Classics</i>, an update of a 1996 remix collection, and <i>Lipslide</i>, singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/850-sarah-cracknell/"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Cracknell's</a> 1997 solo debut, are both far more than the afterthoughts such phrases might suggest. Each vividly represent Saint Etienne's far-flung interests-- their cosmopolitan, dance-oriented side and their more domestic, Burt Bacharach-leaning side-- though not necessarily the one you might think. Most importantly, diehard Saint Etienne fans who've already picked up all of the other reissues have no reason to stop here, and curious newcomers shouldn't have to feel daunted, either.</p>
<p><i>Casino Classics</i> would be notable for historical reasons alone, but happily its top-notch remixers-- and top-notch remix material-- still easily hold their own in this post-EDM era. As a group whose first single, and first hit, converted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young's</a> ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" into dubby Eurodisco, Saint Etienne have never been strangers to the dance realm, and the original 2xCD, 3xLP release was both stacked and prescient. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"" target=""_blank"">The Chemical Brothers'</a> distinctively block-rocking take on <i>Tiger Bay</i>'s krautrock-sleek standout ""Like a Motorway"", for instance, came out here the same month a little song called ""Setting Sun"" hit UK No. 1. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4418-underworld/"" target=""_blank"">Underworld's</a> sprawling space-out on the bass riff from the same album's wordless ""Cool Kids of Death"" just after <i>Trainspotting</i>-famous ""Born Slippy .NUXX"" made its own rise up the charts.</p>
<p>The complete reissue, including two limited-edition bonus discs, adds more than 30 tracks to the original, though nothing from this year's <i>Words and Music</i>. As unwieldy as this approach is for listening all the way through, which I can't recommend trying, it's a smart way of making as much quality material available to fans as possible, and it offers plenty to cherry-pick. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin's</a> two 1993-era appearances-- an Eastern-tinged disemboweling of non-album single ""Who Do You Think You Are"" (a cover with its own intriguing history), and its glitchy, textured B-side-- aren't exactly typical ""dance"" music, but they're enveloping glimpses of an artist who hadn't yet released <i>Selected Ambient Works Volume II</i>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"" target=""_blank"">Broadcast's</a> eerily cinematic ""Angel"" remix came out before the English outfit's first Warp compilation.</p>
<p>Among the new additions, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28150-tiesto/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Tiësto's</a> remix of ""Action,"" originally from 2002's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14255-tiger-bay-finisterre/"" target=""_blank""><i>Finisterre</i></a>, captures the song's return-to-the-clubs feeling-- and also captures Tiësto before he started raking in a reported $22 million annually. And <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3626-richard-x/"" target=""_blank"">Richard X's</a> reworking of ""Method of Modern Love"", the only all-new song from Saint Etienne's 2009 best-of compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12282-london-conversations-the-best-of-saint-etienne/"" target=""_blank""><i>London Conversations</i></a> and one he produced and co-wrote only amps up his subject's ur-pop pleasures, something like his wonderful remix of Cassie's recent ""King of Hearts"". When you throw in a couple of the preexisting comp's standout tracks, such as a breathtaking reworking of <i>Tiger Bay</i> Eurodisco-mainliner ""He's on the Phone"" by Motiv 8 (who did an excellent remix of Spice Girl's ""Wannabe"" around the same time) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5864-andrew-weatherall/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Weatherall's</a> dub-exploring revamp of ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"", it's instructive that so much of what might seem like a leftfield digression for Saint Etienne also underscores their pop charms.</p>
<p>Cracknell's solo <i>Lipslide</i> might seem like the opposite of a remix album, but it winningly isn't so different after all. Like the remixers, Cracknell is making Saint Etienne's songs her own, though unlike them she does so in a style that's not unlike the group's usual approach. After all, she didn't sing on Saint Etienne's first singles, and in a trio with the former music journalists Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs, her role must've been easy for a sometimes chauvinistic critical establishment to discount unfairly. Recorded between her main outfit's masterful electro-folk hybrid <i>Tiger Bay</i> and 1998's Swedish indie pop-indebted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14848-good-humor-tales-from-turnpike-house/"" target=""_blank""><i>Good Humor</i></a>, <i>Lipslide</i> asserts Cracknell's rockist bona fides in the least rockist way possible: She co-writes every song, but they're are unabashedly soft and quotidian, decked out in synths and strings rather than muscular guitars or middlebrow approximations of depth. It's the supposedly interchangeable vocalist reaffirming that the supposedly interchangeable is what really matters anyway.</p>
<p>The 2xCD deluxe edition might surprise some US listeners by mainly restoring the alternate, UK tracklist for the main disc; while a couple of the US-only tracks, such as ""Aussie Soap Girl"", find their way to the bonus disc, not all do. That's probably for the best, as the original lineup makes for a more cohesive listen. ""I don't want the hotels/ I don't want the bars,"" she sings on first single ""Anymore"", a hybrid of contemporary synth-pop and swinging London mod in the finest Saint Etienne mold, and that sets the tone for the album. Swaying opener ""Ready or Not"" hovers lovingly over the banal details-- books to lend, friends who got engaged-- in a conversation with a heartbroken friend, lite club-thumper ""Home"" hints at the romantic anguish between workaday life, and ""Can't Stop Now"" is Dusty Springfield-ish ""daydreaming that love is cool""-- basically the blueprint for later London indie-poppers Lucky Soul.</p>

At least, I think he does. As on most of the record, Welsh's vocals are cryptic mumbles buried beneath an avalanche of samples, loops, and synth drones. No matter, though: you got the idea that a Majical Cloudz song wasn't supposed to be about what Welsh was saying, but more about the experience of getting sucked into its Spin Art swirl of smudged tones, contrasting textures, and fragmented melodies. <i>II</i> had hits and misses, but even when it was firing on all cylinders (the sunset blaze of ""Francisco"", or the heavenly ""Dream World"", which featured the ubiquitous falsetto of Welsh's close friend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a>), it kept the listener at arm's length. It felt appropriate that one lyric of ""Dream"" began ""I'm livin' in a dream world…"" and then trailed off into indiscernible mumbles.</p>
<p>That particular song now feels prophetic not because of its sound, but because of its title: in the time between <i>II</i> and their striking new EP, <i>Turns Turns Turns</i>, Majical Cloudz have gone and cleaned up their dreams. From the EP's no-frills cover to Welsh's appearance in the lead-off track's video (starkly shaved head; Rollins-minimal wardrobe), everything about their image is now streamlined and direct. Their sound has been de-cluttered too, and the songs on the EP greatly benefit from the added breathing room. Matthe Otto's tracks are immersive yet understated, while Welsh's vocals are confident and high in the mix, his melodies, as on the excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14587-what-that-was/"" target=""_blank"">""What That Was""</a>, given time to unfurl and bloom. The leap between <i>II</i> and <i>Turns</i> is so dramatic that Majical Cloudz almost sound like a different band, but listen closely and you'll hear echoes of their past: the particular way these songs feel personal, internal, and move with the churning rhythm of dreams. <i>Turns Turns Turns</i> documents Majical Cloudz' newfound confidence; it's the sound of a band trusting enough in their vision to funnel it into something simpler and more direct.</p>
<p>And yet, there's something almost disarmingly vulnerable about these songs. ""My idea of why I would make music became a lot simpler,"" Welsh said in a recent <a href=""http://www.chartattack.com/features/2012/11/27/interview-majical-cloudz/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, describing a shift in his songwriting process that's happened over the past year. ""Songs became a way to say something to someone that I wouldn't be able to say as clearly in person."" That's the starkest difference between these tracks and their older material: Majical Cloudz has suddenly become very much about what Welsh is saying. These songs have the expressive power of confessions, or handwritten letters. Take the melodic and mesmerizing opening track, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14531-turns-turns-turns/"" target=""_blank"">""Turns, Turns, Turns""</a>, which starts with a hypnotic loop of Welsh's voice singing, ""I…"" and trailing off. The song stammers like this for about a minute, as though it's on the brink of letting us in on a secret but keeps changing its mind. When he finally blurts it out-- ""I did something free, I can't tell if it's wrong""-- the moment feels like a catharsis, and a breakthrough for their whole project. It's hard to believe this is a band that once seemed mysterious and obtuse.</p>
<p>A lot of this comes from the fact that Welsh (who also once twirled knobs in now defunct electro-dreamers Pop Winds) is now embracing his inner frontman. He and Otto both used to man an assortment of samplers, drum machines, and synths during the band's live show, but now he's exclusively on the mic. It's a good look. You wouldn't know from<i> II</i> that Welsh actually has legitimate pipes-- a strong tenor voice that doesn't need reverb or manipulations to sound powerful. Trusting in simple pop melodies and never feeling a need to obscure the most enjoyable elements of these songs, <i>Turns</i> recalls the step Grimes took between her collage-like early LPs and her breakthrough EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15439-darkbloom-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Darkbloom</i></a>. In both cases, the lesson's the same: streamlining your inputs doesn't have to mean compromising your vision-- it usually just makes an artist sound more uniquely and confidently themselves.</p>
<p>Side B of <i>Turns</i> isn't quite as solid, but that's because the front half sets the bar so high. The most powerful song they've done yet is ""What That Was""-- a largehearted, plaintive ode to Welsh's friendship with the Montreal artist Neil Corcoran. It's like a minimalist pop hybrid of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/122-arab-strap/"" target=""_blank"">Arab Strap's</a> ""The First Big Weekend"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem's</a> ""All My Friends"": a catalog of an average weekend's glorious banalities (going to friends' shows, wandering around until Friday becomes Saturday) shot through with just the right amount of warmth and sentiment. Like ""Turns"", it blurts out the things that seem difficult or too obvious to say in person: ""Hey, I think that you're the best friend that I've ever had.../ I didn't think about it until now."" Though the lyrics are full of specificity about Neil and places in Montreal, they never use self-referentiality as a distancing effect; they just express more clearly what's so universal about the song's feeling. Like all of <i>Turns</i>, it's got the warmth and force of a friendly handshake, a handwritten invitation into Majical Cloudz' dream world.</p></div>"|17451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17451-turns-turns-turns-ep/|7.6|Lindsay Zoladz

The two very well-crafted synth-pop tunes on it belonged to a duo called <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/30843-stubborn-heart/"" target=""_blank"">Stubborn Heart</a>-- one of the only details to be hand-stamped on the vinyl's <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Stubborn-Heart-Need-Someone-Two-Times-A-Maybe/release/2857555"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">clean, white inner label</a>. ""Need Someone"" was the record's excellent A-side, clocking in at six minutes and not wasting a single second. On it, a beat stutters and ticks like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9_z1ohHjmk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">early Junior Boys</a>, rubbing up against a bell-like synth and yearning, overlapping vocals, not too far away from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSvb_jGwQ7s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ideas</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15081-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake's eponymous debut</a>.</p>
<p>""Need Someone"" appears again here on the duo's debut, self-titled record and it sounds as good as it ever did. Its inclusion, though, marks its third different release of 2012, which awkwardly highlights a lack of ideas elsewhere on this record. While ""Need Someone"" still boasts a lot of energy and curiosity, much of the material on <i>Stubborn Heart</i> feels a little drab and lifeless by comparison.</p>
<p>Songs like ""It's Not That Easy"" and ""Interpol"" come across as jaded, weighed down by sluggish pace and lack of movement. The latter locks into a nice enough groove but any early promise slowly ebbs away across its five minute duration-- it feels like a relief when it finally crunches to an end. Even when Stubborn Heart do hit a stride, as on the decent-enough ""Starting Block"", they're let down by a lack of lyrical depth.</p>
<p>For much of the record, singer Luca Santucci's yearning vocal obsesses over failed romance-- so much so that ""Starting Block"" line, ""I feel like I'm repeating myself, can't write about anything else, everything else right now sounds insincere"" does at least carry some weight in its honesty. There might well be sincerity to Santucci's wounded lyrics but he never moves beyond scab-picking toward the kind of emotional payoff that great break-up records all share. <i>Stubborn Heart</i> is like the friend who, six months after a break-up, has grown a beard, put on a few pounds, and is no fun at all to have a conversation with. There's no sense of journey to the romantic trauma and across a full hour's running time, the wallowing becomes monotonous. Fortunately, Santucci's voice can sound fairly unique and carries enough characterstic yearning that he doesn't need to over emote.</p>
<p>There are a couple of moments of promise, but they're stuck at the front: ""Penetrate"" starts the record off well, contrasting laid-back vocals with busy rhythms to good effect. Its shimmering, spacious chorus is easily the prettiest moment on <i>Stubborn Heart</i>, too. ""Better Than This"" also works a succinct chorus hook nicely, its central lyric, ""I can do better, you can do better, we can do so much better than this"" teetering between feeling acerbic and comforting.</p>
<p><i>Stubborn Heart</i> is frustrating because the band can do so much better. There's not a lot of light to be found on this record-- the beats are heavy legged and much of the action happens in the miasmic low-end. It all sounds so serious without any real reason for it. You wish they'd snap out of the funk because when they do, Stubborn Heart are capable of making sly, futuristic pop music with real potential. There's not much of it to be found here.</p></div>"|17364.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17364-stubborn-heart/|5.8|Hari Ashurst

Especially in a field that favors merchandise and memorabilia, they're also incredibly under-documented, with a pair of atavistic EPs followed more than a decade later by a compilation collecting those early works and a live set captured in San Francisco in 1991. Still, the band's reputation supersedes their relative commercial obscurity: Their early demos are clear forebears of the current United States black metal scene, with Von's uniform pugnacity helping set the stage for a later caste of norm-breakers. It also didn't hurt that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11987-burzum/"" target=""_blank"">Burzum</a>'s Varg Vikernes wore a long-sleeve <a href=""(http://www.burzum.org/eng/gallery03.php?id=photo09)"" target=""_blank"">Von shirt</a> while on trial for the murder of Mayhem’s Øystein Aarseth.</p>
<p>In 2010, both as the wave of legacy acts reforming surged along and as coverage of United States black metal began reached <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/arts/music/15metal.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the mainstream media</a>, Von reunited. They played London’s Armageddon Fest with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5895-watain/"" target=""_blank"">Watain</a>, the corpsepaint Swedes who'd taken one of their tunes as a name, and released a three-song 7"" of reworked older tunes. In a subsequent interview, cofounders Venien and Goat seemed amicable enough, saying ""being in action feels exhilarating, my friend"" and describing the second leg of their career as fortuitous happenstance. ""Goat and I got back in touch and decided to discuss matters and it sort of started at that point,"" <a href=""http://www.metal-sound.net/interviews.php?read=von"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Venien told Vladimir Petković</a>. ""It really had to make sense to both Goat and I, and it just worked out to be something we were comfortable with.""</p>
<p>The demand for mutual comfort didn't last very long: Though Venien said that there was no full-length in the works only two years ago, Von has returned again with its full-length debut, <i>Satanic Blood</i>-- and, importantly, without Goat. <i>Satanic Blood</i> is the name of the band’s most <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Von/Satanic_Blood/9443"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">infamous demo tape</a>, and this LP's 17 tracks consist largely of reworked archival material; you'll find original versions of almost every tune on <i>Satanic Blood Angel</i>, a 2003 Nuclear War Now! compilation. Goat sang those songs then, but Venien sings them now. He's not an especially great vocalist, but his barely decipherable grunts lend themselves to the quartet's dense roil. His singing doesn't lead the band so much as fit within it, the functional wedge between Von's constant blast beats and repetition-as-a-lifestyle riffs. </p>
<p>Venien's move hasn't necessarily been a popular one, <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2012/10/von_back_from_t.html#more"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">invoking ire on online forums</a> by raising the question of what exactly Von is and who it belongs to, but it works: <i>Satanic Blood</i> is a grueling, sloppy mass of low-fidelity, high-energy metal that gets by on enthusiasm and vigor. Von roars through the title cut, multi-tracked vocals forming a militia of demons around a band that races toward the end. This quartet’s take at ""Devil Pig"" is a hilariously direct Von gem about a porcine in pentagrams. The band treats the tune's simple guitar lead and militant rhythmic approach as though they were edicts to be exalted. No matter the authenticity objections of those playing, the tune is a triumphant 150-second jaunt in the dark. Von's truncated take on ""Goat Christ"" moves with grindcore speed, while Venien chants with the joined force of hardcore and death metal. Von give new oomph to an old standard.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Satanic Blood</i> falters when Venien pushes away from sheer propulsion. Tedious instrumental ""Veadtuck"" aims to evidence the band’s instrumental chops and stylistic prescience but fails on both counts. Mostly, it stalls the mountain of momentum created by the first four tracks. This is the sign and sound of a band-- or part of a band, as it were-- who finally got around to recording an LP after a quarter-century. ""Dissection InHuman"", meanwhile, storms at the start, its messy riff buried within serrated vocals and ceaseless drums. Toward the middle, Venian drops into a ghoulish lurk, letting wind howl around the microphones as the band fecklessly tries to recreate a moonlit ritual. It's as scary as grocery store Halloween decorations; luckily, they lift above the murk one more time, ending the song on one of the record's most convincing black metal bursts. The new ""Jesus Stain"" pummels without apology for most of its four minutes, but it falters at the end when the band switches to stop-time, breaking up the motion like they're auditioning to be the Who. Given the factions that <i>Satanic Blood</i> created, it's tempting to wish for a little progression here, for the addition of some unforeseen flourishes. But Von only sounds convincing when they sound mawkishly simple, too; most everything else comes across as forced. Venien mostly understands that.</p>
<p>The line between perpetuating a legacy and publicly shaming it is a daunting and unpredictable one. In forms that emerged to lash back at the powers that be, whether that be indie rock or heavy metal, simple cash grabs or quick attempts to reiterate a reputation are nauseating reminders of art's function as simple commodity. Already playing some small club shows, if Venien trots this bastardized Von onto the metal festival circuits, that's likely the judgment that awaits his return-- an entitled old guy trying to cash in on inspirational youthful activity. But I'd be lying if I said I despised the band that made <i>Satanic Blood</i> in 2012. They delight in their own shambles, racing off into euphoric, energetic madness like teenagers catching on to an outlandish sound.</p></div>"|17435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17435-satanic-blood/|5.0|Grayson Currin

In 1995, nearly every other band at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins/"" target=""_blank"">Smashing Pumpkins</a>' level was in some way turning its back on its audience: Pearl Jam had started their principled retreat from the spotlight; U2 and R.E.M. were deep within their stagiest, most ironic phases and making their least satisfying music to date; Rivers Cuomo was well on his way towards making <i>Pinkerton</i>; Metallica discovered nail polish; and, of course, Kurt Cobain gave up on life itself. On a much smaller level, even Corgan's eternal rival Steve Malkmus had just released <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9591-wowee-zowee-sordid-sentinels-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Wowee Zowee</a>, </i>a record whose sloppy sprawl was taken by <i><a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/wowee-zowee-19980202"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rolling Stone</a></i> as proof that ""Pavement are simply afraid to succeed.""</p>
<p>Given this mid-decade valley, it's understandable that the 2xCD <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness </i>would be sneered at as self-indulgent. The Smashing Pumpkins hadn't made their appearance at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homerpalooza"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hullabalooza</a> yet, so many were unaware the band had a sense of humor<i>.</i> Still, their reputation was played for laughs. But <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</i> turned out to be one of the most generous records of the decade. During a time when rock heroes were hard to come by, Smashing Pumpkins took it upon themselves to make a record that only teenagers could love and for many it was the only one they needed.</p>
<p>I suppose it's worth mentioning I was 15 when <i>Mellon Collie</i> came out and I would've told you at the time it was my favorite album ever made. Finally, I thought, here was our White Album,<i> Physical Graffiti</i>, or <i>The Wall</i>, but we could<i> </i>watch its legend being constructed in real time without all the received wisdom. It's true, a double album reeks of 70s-style excess that tries to edify its creators. It was meant as Smashing Pumpkins' monument to itself. But in the case of <i>Mellon Collie</i>, it was the only format that could contain the songwriting streak Corgan was going through at the time. Anything shorter would've done his fans a disservice.</p>
<p>This is not an exaggeration. Cull the 14 best tracks from the concurrently recorded <i>The Aeroplane Flies High </i>singles collection and you either have the fourth best Smashing Pumpkins album (behind the perpetually underrated <i>Adore, </i>ahead of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16929-pisces-iscariot/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pisces Iscariot</i></a>) or a strong third disc that would've made <i>Mellon Collie</i> the greatest triple-LP ever made. What becomes more obvious with time is that <i>Mellon Collie</i>, unlike its most common comparison <i>The Wall</i>, has no conceptual framework. There is no plot, almost no filler, and the organization of its two discs is iffy at best: The second song on the seemingly chronological first disc Dawn to Dusk is ""Tonight, Tonight"", while disc two, Twilight to Starlight, contains all of the ugliest metal songs. So <i>Mellon Collie </i>is a Smashing Pumpkins record that just so happens to be 28 songs in length, stunning in both its stylistic range and overall excellence.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the only Smashing Pumpkins record where they acted like an actual band rather than Corgan and his resentful charges. It's hard to pinpoint where the influence of James Iha or D'Arcy came into play (not so with the phenomenal drumming of Jimmy Chamberlin), but with the oversight of producers Flood and Alan Moulder, <i>Mellon Collie </i>was developed through protracted jam sessions and personal interplay. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16059-gish-deluxe-edition-siamese-dream-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Siamese Dream</a>, </i>for all of its symphonic grandeur, was a fairly standard rock album and a solitary one-- nearly all of the guitar and bass parts were rumored to have been performed by Corgan himself. Meanwhile, <i>Mellon Collie </i>indulges in styles more associated with hermetic artists-- ornate chamber-pop (""Cupid De Locke""), mumbly acoustic confessionals (""Stumbleine""), and synthesized nocturnes (mostly everything after ""X.Y.U.""). And it does so while feeling like the work of four people in a room. </p>
<p><i>Mellon Collie</i>'s<i> </i>remarkable breadth is the best indication of Corgan's ability to let loose. You could pick five songs at random and still end up with a diverse batch of singles that would make a case for Smashing Pumpkins being the most stylistically malleable multi-platinum act of the 90s. Maybe it wouldn't sell as many copies, but picture an alternate universe where heavy rotation met the joyous, mechanized grind of ""Love"", ""In the Arms of Sleep""'s unabashed antiquated romanticism, the Prince-like electro-ballad ""Beautiful"", ""Muzzle""'s stadium-status affirmations, or the throttling metal of ""Bodies"".</p>
<p>The ubiquity of the five songs that <i>did </i>become singles overshadows just how idiosyncratic and distinct they were in the scope of 1995. Has there been anything like ""Tonight, Tonight"" since? Orchestral strings typically signify weepy balladry or compositional pretension in rock music, not wonderful, lovestruck propulsion. While ""Tonight, Tonight"" is now inseparable from its <i>Le Voyage dans la lune</i>-inspired video, that the music existed without its guidance only stresses the Pumpkins' sonic creativity. ""Thirty-Three"" was the final and least heralded of the singles-- where on alt-rock radio was there room for a slowpoke, time-signature shifting country song with phased slide guitars and shuffling drum machines?</p>
<p>""Zero"" and ""Bullet With Butterfly Wings"" are the ones that riled up the older folks and, yes, the lyrics are pissy and juvenile and fairly embarrassing. That said, they're far more interesting from a sonic perspective than they're often given credit for. They're the songs where Flood's digitized production fits better than the saturated, analog warmth Butch Vig lent to <i>Siamese Dream</i>. They're basically new wave performed as pop-metal.</p>
<p>And of course, there's ""1979"", the one <i>everybody </i>can agree on. On a record that reveled in 70s prog and pomp without being restricted to it, it sounds futuristic. And while just as youth-obsessed as everything else here, it's one of the few times where high school sounds like something that can be remembered fondly. Corgan loves to stress how it was the last song to make the record, and while its chorus does have an effortless charge embodying the ""urgency of now,"" it's the only <i>Mellon Collie </i>song that functions best as nostalgia. That reading is no doubt abetted by another fantastic video, but while ""1979"" is an unimpeachable song, the rush to praise it as an outlier does its surroundings a tremendous disservice. While <i>Mellon Collie</i> is the realization of all Billy Corgan's ambitions, most of the criticisms surround the lyrics for not being as personal as those on the tortured <i>Siamese Dream</i>. It's this way by design. </p>
<p>The terms ""sad machines"" and ""<i>teen </i>machines"" are interchangeably used during ""Here Is No Why"", a pep talk to the outwardly sullen mopes who Corgan urges to break free of either and ascend like its heroic guitar solo. ""Bullet With Butterfly Wings"" is notorious for its chorus, but teen angst doesn't fight fair; you need some seriously heavy ammo to resist it. The mudslide of distortion that ushers in its bridge leads towards two minutes of the most viscerally exciting music that Smashing Pumpkins produced. Then immediately after, the mournful ""To Forgive"" devastates with a personal detail that gives Corgan credibility in all of this: ""And I remember my birthdays/ Empty party afternoons."" This is the kind of youthful, inexplicable emotional whiplash that can result in an immolating hatebomb called ""Fuck You (An Ode to No One)"" being followed by a giddy proclamation that ""love solves everything."" It's clearly not a mature way of dealing with life, but that's only a problem if you somehow believe <i>Mellon Collie </i>isn't meant as rock 'n' roll fantasy. When Corgan declares ""I know that I was meant for this world"" during ""Muzzle"", it's <i>your </i>happy ending.</p>
<p>So, yes, most people who have developed a meaningful relationship with <i>Mellon Collie </i>did so in their youth. The question is whether you can get anything new from this in 2012. As with all of the Smashing Pumpkins reissues, <i>Mellon Collie </i>is giving: the Deluxe boxed set justifies its sticker shock by containing ""re-imagined cover art, velvet-lined disc holder and decoupage kit for creating your own scenes from the Mellon Collie Universe,"" which is everything you'd imagine and thensome. There are an extra 64 tracks and only a few of them appeared on <i>The Aeroplane Flies High</i>, though most of these inclusions are demos or alternate takes, the sort of thing that should only be listened to multiple times by people who are being paid to do so, i.e., music critics and Flood.</p>
<p>But there is a way of hearing the same album differently as you refract it through your own experiences. ""Thru the Eyes of Ruby"" is rumored to have contained 70 guitar tracks; it's a wedding vow punctuated by Corgan snarling ""youth is wasted on the young."" This isn't meant to negate the intent of the 90 minutes that preceded it, it's a reminder of how <i>Mellon Collie </i>can communicate different things to someone who's 30 as opposed to 15. Revisiting it can feel like leafing through a high school yearbook-- not necessarily your own, just <i>somebody</i>'s. And there's solace in how, for all of the navel-gazing that went on, the ridiculousness of it all somehow escapes you. What you wore, how you spoke, what you felt<i> </i>not so much seeming normal as just <i>the way it is</i>. You look at each person, thinking that they might hope to achieve the self-actualization promised by ""Muzzle"", to lose themselves in another person in the manner described by ""Beautiful"" or ""In the Arms of Sleep"", or to embrace their own awkwardness as a rallying cry like ""We Only Come Out at Night"". Those events were all right around the corner, as they are for just about anybody growing up, but when you're locked up in your room listening to <i>Mellon Collie </i>for hours on end, they seem as distant and fantastical as the album cover. When Corgan sings ""believe in me"" during ""Tonight, Tonight"", you don't have much of a choice if you want to escape.  </p>
<p>I'd like to say ""they don't make 'em like this anymore,"" which is true if you want to talk about rock bands who make double-LPs that sell 10 million copies thanks in part to lavish videos that air constantly on MTV. They <i>do </i>make 'em like this, in spirit, albeit very rarely-- 2012 appears to be just as hostile as 1995 was towards embracing the life-altering possibilities of classic rock or pursuing actual populism. It's no wonder Corgan is so agitated about the state of rock music these days, since his critics won. But every now again, there will be something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/"" target=""_blank"">M83's <i>Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16564-japandroids-celebration-rock/"" target=""_blank"">Japandroids' </a><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16564-japandroids-celebration-rock/"" target=""_blank"">Celebration Rock</a>-- </i>that get there in their own way and express what the Pumpkins did on ""Tonight, Tonight"", that ""the impossible is possible<i> tonight</i>,"" as in right now. They have little to do with <i>Mellon Collie </i>except that they sacrifice being cool to show a deep respect for the way teenagers interact with music. When the world is a vampire, you don't want history lessons or a list of influences, you want <i>fucking magic. </i>You don't want lifestyle music, you don't want <i>Our Band Could Be Your Life.</i> You want music that you can live inside. Damn right Smashing Pumpkins shot for the moon on <i>Mellon Collie, </i>but only because they wanted to give you the sun and the stars.</p></div>"|17389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17389-mellon-collie-and-the-infinite-sadness/|9.3|Ian Cohen

With the exception of one song that didn't make the original tacked onto the end, the tracklist runs in the same order, as if comparing embryonic renditions to their final form in their intended order could be the only point of letting people hear your rough song sketches.</p>
<p><i>Demos</i> is the bonus half of a reissue of <i>Tramp</i>, though you can buy it separately. <i>Tramp</i> was likely given the deluxe treatment so soon after its initital release in order to sustain the new-found popularity Van Etten's seen this year: The Brooklyn-based singer performed on late-night shows in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48198-watch-sharon-van-etten-and-jessie-ware-perform-on-later-with-jools-holland-again/"" target=""_blank"">Britain</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45005-watch-tune-yards-and-sharon-van-etten-on-late-night-television-last-night/"" target=""_blank"">America</a>, and this week, played her biggest ever U.K. gig (2,000 capacity) and got announced as the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48805-nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds-announce-north-american-tour-with-sharon-van-etten/"" target=""_blank"">main support</a> for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds</a>' 2013 U.S. tour. All timeliness aside, though, <i>Demos</i> reveals the most when compared to an album that's nearly four years old.</p>
<p>One of the nicest impromptu presents anyone ever gave to me was a CDR of Sharon Van Etten's home recordings, bought at an early British gig. The unmarked, home-burned CD came inside a piece of folded brown parcel paper, held together with black tape, decorated with a square of colorful wrapping. Inside it is another brown sheet covered in splodgy typewriter text: two sides of blocks of lyrics without punctuation or paragraphing, followed by a handwritten note apologizing for the noise on the recordings, a request for feedback, and an old email address. Most of the songs are on Van Etten's debut album proper, the acoustic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13226-because-i-was-in-love/"" target=""_blank""><i>Because I Was in Love</i></a>, where they weren't exactly beefed up, but at least there were no trains rumbling past the studio window to intrude on proceedings.</p>
<p><i>Home Recordings</i> was done in Sharon's then-basement, and her voice is often so quiet that even the atmosphere picked up by the microphone overpowers her. These recordings were made at a time when Van Etten's confidence was low, when she didn't have as many champions-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a>'s Kyp Malone initially encouraged her to play shows after she'd moved back to the north-east after escaping her ex-boyfriend-- when she was probably able to personally express her gratitude and hand change over to every person that bought their handmade copy of the CD at those early shows. A different kind of human interaction made <i>Tramp</i>-- a large ensemble affair produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a>'s Aaron Dessner, starring members of his band, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4548-the-walkmen/"" target=""_blank"">the Walkmen</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/636-beirut/"" target=""_blank"">Beirut</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5739-wye-oak/"" target=""_blank"">Wye Oak</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27745-the-antlers/"" target=""_blank"">the Antlers</a> among others-- but the sense of solitude is just as important to <i>Demos</i>.</p>
<p><i>Tramp</i> was named as a nod to Van Etten's homelessness during the making of her third album, and <i>Demos</i>' liner notes-- in that same blobby typewriter font-- draw a map from the backstage area at a Warsaw show to a Bushwick basement, friends' places in Fort Greene, her parents' house in New Jersey, Tokyo, producer Aaron Dessner's Brooklyn studio, and her bedroom. The carefully produced package features a droopy self-portrait on the front, a half-homage to those of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"" target=""_blank"">Leonard Cohen</a>, perhaps. (""Leonard"" on <i>Tramp</i> was named for his influence; the cover of that record had Van Etten emulating <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/649-john-cale/"" target=""_blank"">John Cale</a>'s close-up portrait from <i>Fear</i>.) A note from Van Etten inside the <i>Demos</i> package was written from the first solo holiday she ever took, to Cancun in summer 2011 while recording <i>Tramp</i>, and ruminations on the comfort of aloneness (rather than loneliness) pepper the diary excerpts within the liner notes, where she also explains each song's origin. Some are as old as the music on <i>Home Recordings</i>, but only saw life on <i>Tramp</i> due to their author's hesitation to reveal a certain side of herself until that point.</p>
<p>She calls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12810-serpents/"" target=""_blank"">""Serpents""</a> ""really aggressive,"" and the lyrics here differ from the album in that it's Van Etten (or her character) who has thrown a bowl at someone at the start, and it ends with her raggedly challenging a knife with the threat, ""Well, I've got a gun""-- unlikely, of course, but an unfettered expression of frustration, vengeance, and self-protection against emotional abuse. Van Etten originally worried that ""In Line"", one of <i>Tramp</i>'s most affecting songs, was too much of a ""dirge,"" but Dessner encouraged her to give it a go. The demo is one of the lesser formed songs here, where she beats at an acoustic's sloppy strings while feeling around the vocal melody; ""the world was shitty then"" is one of the only audible phrases.</p>
<p>These demos appear in various states of finish, with Van Etten often either feeling out the space where words will eventually go, or extemporizing with a total lack of self-consciousness, her streams of thought sometimes revealing more than the polished <i>Tramp</i> eventually would. You sometimes read bands talking in interviews about how even when they're playing the same songs at gigs each night, doing so takes them back to the exact point where they first wrote them: bullshit. ""Joke or a Lie"" is shorter than its <i>Tramp</i> equivalent, but there's a gulf between every lingered-over line; her liner notes reveal that this song was written after ""a lover gave up"" on her, recorded while ""chain smoking in my bedroom and letting the smoke rise between strums."" She sings at full volume, a small reclamation of power in the face of desertion. </p>
<p><i>Home Recordings</i> was intended as an invitation-- the show itself-- whereas <i>Demos</i> is the curtain reveal, dipping its toes into uglier palettes, marked by the gloom and clank of recording in confined spaces on primitive equipment. Stripping <i>Tramp</i> back to its most basic form demonstrates how Van Etten's approach to songwriting has changed. <i>Home Recordings</i> follows mellifluous folky structures with the guide of an acoustic guitar, but that tradition has disappeared from Van Etten's more recent writing; there's less ornate fingerpicking, and more monotone strumming that propels her rough lyrics along with a tense, anxious pace. There's no playing the singer-songwriter, as Matthew Murphy alluded to in his review of <i>Because I Was in Love</i>; she's now beholden to letting what she wants to say dictate the shape rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>By and large, <i>Demos</i> contains very little that would surprise anyone familiar with <i>Tramp</i>, but there's more to this collection than marveling at how funny <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/directors-cut/8968-sharon-van-ette-magic-chords/"" target=""_blank"">""Magic Chords""</a> sounds with a rinky-dink drum machine instead of that snare purr, or the way ""I'm Wrong"" unfolds when stripped of the shimmering production parade with which it marches outward. As well as lifting the curtain on <i>Tramp</i>, releasing <i>Demos</i> feels like an act of dispossession masquerading as a modest recognition of appreciation. In 2012, Van Etten has released more music in one year than ever before-- there have been singles, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13323-life-of-his-own/"" target=""_blank"">b-sides</a>, a song for ""Boardwalk Empire"", a Christmas <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cTj_nLEim4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">duet</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4542-rufus-wainwright/"" target=""_blank"">Rufus Wainwright</a>, a strange, ""Twin Peaks""-indebted four-song collection called <i>Psychajealous</i> that you got if you bought <i>Tramp</i> at London's Rough Trade. A certain swathe of people know about Sharon Van Etten, and a decent proportion of them know the much-cited, boyfriend-related situation that inspired a lot of her music and has dominated much of the conversation around it. <i>Demos</i> feels like a final act of blood-letting. Whatever comes next will be a fresh body.</p></div>"|17474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17474-tramp-deluxe-edition/|7.1|Laura Snapes

He did this most memorably in 2003, when his DJ-Kicks mix made the booming electroclash scene play like a big party instead of a bunch of pissy punk rockers with sequencers. Since then he's released a trunk-full of singles and remixes, along with two artist albums notable mostly for their goofy insouciance. Less visibly, he's stewarded the shockingly productive <a href=""http://www.planet-turbo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Turbo Recordings</a>, a label that, if it hasn't quite predicted every major trend in dance music during the last half-decade, has at least been on the cusp, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/909-chromeo/"" target=""_blank"">Chromeo</a>'s 80s revivalism to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29053-azari-iii/"" target=""_blank"">Azari &amp; III</a>'s pilfering of Chicago house to the label's more recent focus on the gritty end of tech house. His record as a taste barometer is flawless.</p>
<p>Befitting his label's recent direction, Tiga's <i>Non Stop</i> mix for Pias/Different Recordings focuses on pug-nosed, gritty dance. Tiga weaves them into a broader pop context that includes nonchalant indie-electro (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28205-kindness/"" target=""_blank"">Kindness</a>' magnificent Mats' cover, ""Swingin' Party"") and contemporary pop-rap-- his Tyga-refactoring ""Track City Bitch"" is clever and annoying. These are sore thumbs, obvious ones from an artist who has snatched in for reworking ""Sunglasses at Night"" and ""Hot in Here"", but they're hardly all that's on offer. <i>Non Stop</i> shines when it marries the rambunctiousness of recent Turbo mainstays such as Clouds and Duke Dumont with everything from abstract indie (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/"" target=""_blank"">Actress</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Panda Bear</a> remix) to noise-punk tirades (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30051-factory-floor/"" target=""_blank"">Factory Floor</a>) and analogue purism (the hotly tipped <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29870-blawan/"" target=""_blank"">Blawan</a> and Locked Groove).</p>
<p>It's those Turbo artists that <i>Non Stop</i> really cradles, all this infrastructure that makes Duke Dumont's ""Street Walker"" the type of track casual fans could pick out of a lineup; that makes Clouds' stomping ""Those Cracks in Your Face, Do They Hurt?"" sound playful. He's not offering these tracks in context: he's removing them from it, from an all-house, all-techno world in which they might seem gray, or rote, or merely good. There is a level of whimsy here not available in a standard Fabric or DJ-Kicks offering. That whimsy can serve as a gateway, and that's really valuable.</p>
<p><i>Non Stop</i> is an alloy so primly tailored to every conceivable dance music trend that it's worth wondering if Tiga has a cool nephew or a bug planted in a Hardwax buyer's laptop. The real explanation-- that Tiga is an exceptionally tuned-in connoiseur-- is less exciting, but it doesn't subtract from the casual mixology of <i>Non Stop</i>.

The group, led by conductor, composer, and singer Brad Wells, are interested in the places where the human voice is stretched to extremes, and they've gone to great lengths to study all the wildest sounds it can make: Inuit throat singing, Korean p'ansori singing, yodeling. All of these and more can be found on their self-titled, Kickstarter-financed debut album: Filled with whoops, ululations, grunts, and chattering cries, the album is violent, but in an ingratiating kind of way.</p>
<p>Their name nicks a line from the old Bing Crosby/Bob Hope picture <i><a href=""http://vid2.anyclip.com/ZsfpBPK7jlcljneVQxnBzb14HV1yuBCSuLxgZOnU2OIOZzaO8IUaX8s-pZHDxa+tKuGDgvHHrXri+O26yT3dNchUjjEIk66v4e31bdo8X+s="" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Road to Morocco</a></i>, a breezily nonsensical slapstick travelogue filled with bumbling sheiks and talking camels. You might be tempted to infer some sort of cultural appropriation in-joke from the reference, but the only thing the group and the movie share is a freewheeling, madcap spirit. ""Montmartre"", by Judd Greenstein, veers between cartoony ""neener-neener"" solfège singing and Meredith Monk-ish chatters to breathy flutters. ""Amid the Minotaurs"", by composer and New Amsterdam co-founder William Brittelle, begins as an ersatz jazz madrigal and ends with a gloriously ludicrous, Lita Ford-style power ballad finale. As a composer, Brittelle is heroically unafraid of flirting and occasionally consummating the relationship with bad taste, and ""Amid The Minotaurs"", like his 2010 AOR prog-rock suite <i>Television Landscape</i>, has the nervy throwdown feel of an aesthetic dare.</p>
<p>Many pieces on <i>Roomful of Teeth</i> deal with the idea of overlapping chatter and information overload. On ""Passacaglia"", one of four pieces by composer and ensemble member Caroline Shaw scattered across the record, singers chant technical jargon-- ""The 86th, 87th, and 88th points are located symmetrically across the central vertical axis of the wall""-- in sedate, friendly-stewardess tones over a luminous background of ""oohs,"" channeling the supermarket Zen of <i>Einstein on the Beach</i>. The voices blur together, mimicking the feeling of being marooned among competing conversations at a cocktail party. The grunts, breaths and vocalizations of Shaw's ""Courante"", meanwhile, start off somewhere vaguely sexual, and end up feeling like raindrops hitting a window, just another auditory input in a world overflowing with them. </p>
<p>Roomful of Teeth often <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLoDcMOsVAM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">perform live</a> with Merrill Garbus, aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27618-tune-yards/"" target=""_blank"">tUnE-yArDs</a>, and she has such a natural rapport with the group that she almost seems like a lost member of their gathering. She contributes two choral works here, both drawing on non-Western singing styles: ""Quizassa"" is heavily influenced by the singing of the Bulgarian Women's Choir and might make some listeners think of the keening, sour vocal harmonies of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a>. (In fact, anyone curious about what that band's vocal techniques sound like when elongated might be interested in Roomful of Teeth.) Her other piece, ""Ansa Ya"", concludes the album, and features a mesmerizing, skirling vocal stutter effect I don't have the vocabulary or knowledge to even identify. It's exhilarating, though, and like most of <i>Roomful of Teeth</i>, it will send an unnameable thrill down your spine.</p></div>"|17413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17413-roomful-of-teeth/|7.0|Jayson Greene

In recent years it's gained influence in the underground metal world, and in the process of expanding has spawned a number of hybrid offspring, from relatively predictable combinations like blackened death metal and blackened crust punk to such unexpected variants as black-metal-influenced industrial music and the accurately named subgenre black 'n' roll.</p>
<p><i>Greatest of Deceivers</i>, the fourth album by Borre, Norway's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30890-nidingr/"" target=""_blank"">Nidingr</a> since 1996, the group takes a black metal approach to a lengthy list of influences. The group's mastermind, Morten Iversen, better known as Teloch, has been involved in the Scandinavian black metal scene since the prime of its second wave when it was ruled by a hardline orthodoxy that didn't allow for much in the way of crossover, and when a lot of other metal scenes didn't want much to do with it in return.</p>
<p>Despite his involvement with such classically-minded groups as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10031-mayhem/"" target=""_blank"">Mayhem</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10034-gorgoroth/"" target=""_blank"">Gorgoroth</a>, 1349, and Ov Hell, Iversen's got an especially broad sonic vision. <i>Greatest of Deceivers </i><span>is a dense and complex mass made up of songs that themselves generally have more discrete movements than you can count on one hand. Some of them offer blackened takes on full-throttle death metal and crust punk. Others offer complicated leads and tricky time signatures that hint at mathcore and sometimes even at a particularly gnarly interpretation of jazz. Occasionally the group cuts back the aggression sharply and coasts into near-ambiance. In terms of compositional ambition the songs are closer to the labyrinthine post-rock and post-hardcore bands of the mid to late 90s than the savagely straightforward black metal outfits that were operating around the same time.</span></p>
<p>This complexity is a double edged sword. On the one hand there is something about listening to a finely tuned band rip through such daunting compositions with machine-like precision that is very easy to enjoy in the same way as watching Olympic-level sports or other human skill refined to a point far out of the reach of the average person. There's also just a surfeit of material to digest, and having it come at you at such a rapid rate can be satisfyingly overwhelming. Black metal's had symphonic ambitions since it first took root in Norway, and Nidingr's baroque works often feel like the a group reaching to live up to them and succeeding.</p>
<p>But the problem with extreme partsiness, as many of the aforementioned post-rock and post-hardcore bands have demonstrated, is that the more parts you add to a song the greater the likelihood that one or more is going to be a clunker, and on <i>Greatest of Deceivers</i><span> the clunkers come at a distractingly steady pace. The tricky mathcore bits are technically impressive, but when they pop up in the middle of a blistering bit of truly wicked death metal it can ruin the mood. The group's also less adept at spacey textural playing than the fast-and-complicated stuff, and the quasi-ambient excursions can be stiff and vaguely awkward.</span></p>
<p>The frustrating part is that when the band dials down their ambition and plays it straight on the mid-album highlights ""The Balances"" and ""Vim Patior"", they're untouchable, with the perfect ratio of brutality to finesse. Iversen and his longtime creative partner Damien ""Blargh"" <span>Hammeren both favor thick, crunchy guitar tones over the traditional tinny black metal attack, and on pummelling tracks like ""The Balances"" they cleverly fit together just a couple of guitar parts to make a gestalt that sounds very big and very evil, with hooky riffs snuck into the mix almost subliminally. </span><span>It feels wrong to fault a bunch of musicians for being ambitious and wanting to challenge themselves and their audience, but when a band is so good at playing it straight and simple it's hard to argue that they even need to.</span></p></div>"|17453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17453-greatest-of-deceivers/|5.7|Miles Raymer

But the early-aughts New York of <i>Turn on the Bright Lights</i> is not the young, vibrant, and impossibly cool place of cultural myth. It is a darker and more complicated place, fraught with disappointment and disconnection. It is a crushingly <i>real </i>place, rendered in such vivid emotional detail that it rings true even to those who have never set foot in the city. This stellar 10th Anniversary reissue documents the process by which a handful of pretty-good songs became a truly great album, making it painfully and unequivocally clear that <i>Turn on the Bright Lights</i> is the sum of its players, not its influences.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In retrospect, 2002 may have been the very year that we stopped talking about <i>how</i> music sounds, and started talking about <i>what other music </i>it sounds <i>like.</i> ""Interpol sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a>"" was one of the first critical observations to turn into a full-fledged meme. In the intervening years, other bands have sounded a <i>whole lot more</i> like Joy Division, and the comparison now feels like just that: a comparison. While Joy Division could channel enormous amounts of energy through Ian Curtis's intense delivery, Interpol pulled off a real magic trick by constructing a framework complex and dynamic enough to bring singer Paul Banks' inscrutable deadpan to life. Banks's words can be downright laughable on paper, and are often sung as if WRITTEN OUT IN ALL CAPS WITH NO PUNCTUATION. But from this insistent, exaggerated blankness, the band coaxed a genuinely unnerving sense of alienation and melancholy. These songs are packed with a staggering amount of rhythmic and melodic tension, sometimes amplifying minuscule expressive nuances in Banks's voice, and sometimes drawing attention to their disconcerting absence. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Each individual member of the band has his own role in piecing this puzzle together. Drummer Sam Fogarino is the perfect anchor for Carlos Dengler's busy, melodic bass lines, keeping the rhythm section forceful and grounded. Guitarist Daniel Kessler is the album's unsung hero, expanding the band's dynamic range by oscillating between wide, monolithic chords and narrow, winding leads. The album's second single ""NYC"" achieves two unlikely successes pioneered by Matador labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/731-chavez/"" target=""_blank"">Chavez</a>: structuring a ballad around loud, steady drums and withholding all bass guitar until the chorus. ""The New"" slips a disco bass line under a morass of swirling, detuned guitars. There are a lot of things about <i>Turn on the Bright Lights</i> that should not work, and <i>would</i> not work were they not so carefully thought through and artfully implemented.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Three batches of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48647-listen-to-interpols-roland-demo-from-the-turn-on-the-bright-lights-10th-anniversary-reissue/"" target=""_blank"">demo recordings</a> are far and away the most interesting bonus materials on this <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48013-interpol-to-release-deluxe-reissue-of-debut-album-turn-on-the-bright-lights/"" target=""_blank"">extensive reissue</a>, as they show just how close the album came to not working. The first three-song demo, recorded in 1998 and featuring album cuts ""PDA"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48647-listen-to-interpols-roland-demo-from-the-turn-on-the-bright-lights-10th-anniversary-reissue/"" target=""_blank"">""Roland""</a>, comes off as an unremarkable practice tape by a band with lots of good ideas but insufficient energy and chemistry to pull them all together. The second three-song demo, recorded at Brooklyn's Rare Book Room in 1999, is more worked over with decidedly mixed results; there are some jarringly tacky too-loud keyboards here, and a sing-spoken interlude that can't help but bring to mind Crazy Town's ""Butterfly"". Somewhat ironically, it is only the third and final four-song demo, recorded at the band's practice space, where Interpol stops sounding like four guys in a practice space tentatively running through busy rock songs. Much of this can be credited to Fogarino, who joined the band between their second and third tapes and brought with him a rhythmic confidence and swagger that provided the crucial missing piece of Interpol's singular <i>sound</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This progression of demo recordings documents not only the evolution of the band's playing, but also their increasing attention to texture and ambiance. As the group grew more confident, the gritty sonics of their demos became less incidental to the songs they were making, and more a part of the songs themselves. Producer Peter Katis did an amazing job of preserving and amplifying this rawness, and the band themselves crucially revisited many elements of their demos to better suit their evolving capabilities. The slight changes that Fogarino made to the kick pattern at the beginning of ""PDA"" completely <i>make</i> the song's signature introduction, taking it from ""oh, there's a drumbeat"" to ""OH, there's THAT drumbeat."" Banks gave his lyrics a thorough tune-up before the recording the album, excising his most rhythmically formless lines and shoring up the critical interplay between his voice and the rest of the band. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The extensive liner notes here are as much about the city in which Interpol operated as the band itself. It's certainly interesting, especially for those who are up on their New York City indie rock landmarks. And while the photographs included here do a good job of documenting the physical locations where this album was born, the album itself conveys the setting in a deeper way. Suggesting that this album is simply a product of its time and place is no less naive than suggesting that anyone who has ever been in love could easily write, arrange and record an amazing love song. There were a lot of good bands in New York in 2002, but only one band made this record.</p></div>"|17324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17324-turn-on-the-bright-lights-the-tenth-anniversary-edition/|9.5|Matt LeMay

The quiet ""De Novo Adagio"" is meant to set the stage for the drama to come, but it handily accomplishes two other things as well. First, it reminds listeners that Keys is a classically trained musician, that she graduated from Professional Performing Arts School and studied at Columbia University. Her studies no longer determine her sound the way they once did, but a moment like this reminds you she's a serious artist.</p>
<p>Second: ""De Novo Adagio"", which translates loosely to ""Adagio Again"", signals that <i>Girl on Fire</i> is an album about rebirth and renewal. That girl on fire is a phoenix, and to demonstrate that point, ""Adagio"" segues seamlessly into ""Brand New Me"", a slow-burning declaration of independence co-written with Scottish singer-songwriter Emeli Sandé. Keys excels at this kind of self-esteem anthem, but this one feels a little too familiar-- an old way of introducing her new self. That song is followed by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-smith/"">Jamie xx</a>-produced ""When It's All Over"", and it's perhaps a sign that I'm listening to too much Taylor Swift that I naturally wondered what had happened in Keys' personal life to warrant a record so heavy on break-up songs. Then I remembered that it doesn't matter: Keys has retooled and reinvented herself, however subtly and slightly, on every album, so it makes sense that she would use romantic tragedy as the engine for transformation.</p>
<p>Four albums about rebirth, however, can become a bit predictable, if not an outright drag. Neither ""Brand New Me"" nor ""When It's Over"" does much that Keys hasn't done in the past, but then she drops ""New Day"", a heavy banger that actually feels brand new. With her sharp eh-eh-eh-ehs and slightly accented delivery, she sounds like she's channeling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"">Rihanna</a> without the regrettable drama that has sadly infected the ""Umbrella"" singer's most recent efforts. In a way this is exactly the kind of song we wish Rihanna were singing: something strong and forceful and self-assertive, something that writes the happy ending we want for our pop stars. Keys throws herself into the song; her voice quavering during the rawer moments, as though the notes are well within her range but the emotions are not.</p>
<p>A collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5427-swizz-beatz/"">Swizz Beatz</a> (Keys' husband) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dr. Dre</a>, ""New Day"" has a transformative effect within the album, whose middle is as strong as any sequence of songs Keys has recorded. After a rough start lyrically (""She's just a girl and she's on fire""), the title track features Keys' most powerful vocals and a too-brief cameo from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki Minaj</a>, who sounds like she's just getting started before her verse comes to an end. ""Fire We Make"", her duet with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27978-maxwell/"">Maxwell</a>, is an old-fashioned slow jam that doesn't have a whole lot of actual song to it and honestly doesn't need it. Instead, it's an excuse for vocal and sexual fireworks from two of r&amp;b's strongest singers, with Keys' bold voice evocatively contrasting Maxwell's softer, slightly hoarse delivery.</p>
<p>Keys has always chosen her collaborators well, and even when she's working with the ultimate alpha males (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a> on <i>The Diary of Alicia Keys</i>, John Mayer on <i>As I Am</i>), she never lets anyone elbow her out of the spotlight. Still, the announcement that she was doing a song with Bruno Mars and the Smeezingtons, the team responsible for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/910-cee-lo-green/"">Cee Lo Green</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11963-fuck-you/"">""Fuck You""</a> and Mars' own <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR6iYWJxHqs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Grenade""</a>, was enough to arch some eyebrows. They're pop throwbacks, but they throw back to a completely different pop era than Keys evokes, and does anyone want to see this woman, who seems to draw inspiration from Aretha and Pam Grier equally, show up at the sockhop? Surprisingly, ""Tears Always Win"" manages to split the difference between Keys and Mars, and the retro flourishes-- the shuffling drumbeat, the doo wop backing vocals-- reinforce rather than distract from the pain in Keys' vocals and lyrics. With its bedroom setting and emotional insomnia, the song comes across like a sequel to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11659-try-sleeping-with-a-broken-heart/"">""Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart""</a>, holding its own against one of Key's finest moments.</p>
<p>After that comes ""Not Even the King"", which features just Keys and her piano. It's a respectable ballad, albeit a bit too devoted to its own metaphor, and it's refreshing to hear her in such a spare setting. But it also brings the album back down to earth, stalling the momentum she'd established. Following the rhythmically and grammatically awkwardly ""Limitedless"", a pair of fine ballads, ""One Thing"" and ""101"", sound good on their own but dour as back-to-back closers. The latter culminates in a loud coda that's among the heaviest passages Keys has recorded, full of shouted hallelujahs and some startlingly violent beats. It's a risky move, about as far from the pensive notes of ""De Novo Adagio"" as Keys could get, but she doesn’t pull it off. Far too bombastic to be especially cathartic, ""101"" makes for a gently unsatisfying conclusion to an otherwise assured album. It never quite lives up to its theme of rebirth, but especially given the range and power she's showed in the past, it doesn't really need to.</p></div>"|17476.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17476-girl-on-fire/|7.1|Stephen M.

Neither Ghost nor the LOX have switched up their style in over a decade, which makes listening to Wu-Block feel a little like watching a late-period Woody Allen film; before anyone opens their mouth, you already know exactly how everyone will sound, what they will talk about, what the surroundings will look like. If you're drawn to <i>Wu-Block</i>, it's probably at least in part for the way it promises, for 50 minutes or so, to shut the door on surprises.</span></p>
<p><span>Luckily, it's coming out, as all Ghostface-related projects do, right before the holiday season, a moment when we're all a little fonder of hoary old institutions and a little more susceptible to nostalgia. Ghost and D-Block are mascots of an unchanging NYC, as reliable as a  beloved slice joint. But there's a blurry line where ""reliable"" fades into ""stagnant,"" and mileage will vary for rap fans where <i>Wu-Block</i> falls. (Me, I still can't quite shake the memory that one of these guys, Ghost, was one of the most constantly surprising to ever do it.)</span></p>
<p>The tone is established from the opening seconds: The first song is called “Crack Spot Stories"". It opens with the sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3634-raekwon/"" target=""_blank"">Raekwon</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8872-jadakiss/"" target=""_blank"">Jadakiss</a>, Ghost, and Sheek arguing over who has the remote, and the production is a faded soul loop. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9462-sheek-louch/"" target=""_blank"">Sheek Louch</a> nails the project's slightly-too-comfy vibe in one line: ""Fiends at the door, I'm too lazy to let 'em in/ Turkey sandwich, barbecue chips, ESPN."" Ghost is ""chillin' in his robe,"" while Raekwon is sitting with his ""leg back, examining choices."" The scene is less crack-spot than man-cave, a bunch of grouchy old guys cracking each other up with the door closed to the outside world.</p>
<p>All of them sound great, though, and it's nice to hear them settle comfortably into their roles as older heads. Ghost is still finding vivid notes within his coke-sniffing kingpin fantasy persona, which is more than a decade old. ""If I sneeze, the left side of my nose might rip,"" he yelps on ""Comin For Ya Head"". In that same verse, he gives us some home potency remedies (""You eat seal meat, dick stay up for a fuckin' week"") and takes us to ""a brutal rap battle in Zaire."" On ""Take Notice"", he says ""I do hood yoga/ I pull muscles counting money, need a new shoulder,"" and in a club-scene verse on ""Pull Tha Cars Out"", he shows off his still-sharp flair for imagery: ""A baby ghost appeared from the blunt smoke/ It lingered through her hair and set into her clothes.""</p>
<p>Neither Sheek Louch nor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5555-styles-p/"" target=""_blank"">Styles P</a> ever had golden ages like Ghost's to live up to: They've been endearing knuckleheads pretty much since Day One, and they're as enjoyable, more or less, as always. Sheek Louch's ""winded touch-football participant"" flow tends to make his dumb jokes hit harder than they should (see ""My chain lower than your GPA,"" from ""Take Notice""),  but they make his unintentionally funny lines even funnier: ""My bars is prenatal!"" he yells on ""Comin For Ya Head"". Styles P has always flowed like steel shavings (one of the most quotable lines of his career is still <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5jDvx1QKCc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""I don't give a fuck who you are/ So fuck who you are""</span></a><span>), and his best line here is when he sneers  the line ""probably in the crib getting high watching </span><i>Fargo</i><span>"" with a fierceness all out of proportion to the act of watching the movie </span><i>Fargo</i><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>There are other familiar faces, too: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/679-cappadonna/"" target=""_blank"">Cappadonna</a>, yelling about a girl with a ""thunder butt"" on ""Pour Tha  Martini""; GZA working out an over-labored ""life-as-car"" metaphor on ""Drivin Round"", a song that also features a lightly crooning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"" target=""_blank"">Erykah Badu</a>. Raekwon sounds amazing, always, but his cadences and slang have budged so little over the years that everything he says has started to sound the same, giving his lines a ""pull-string Raekwon"" feel: ""Sit back, laughin' with a stack and a clapper."" See? You know exactly how that sounds.</span></p>
<p>But again, that familiarity is the point of Wu-Block. Everyone on the album sounds engaged and happy to be in the room. There are a handful of goofy skits, and a lot of hilarious cross-chatter in the album's margins: after  the song ""All in Together"" ends, they stick around to make fun of people who wear fake jewelry. On ""Take Notice"", Ghost yells about the cold he has, acting grumpy and pulling the covers around him in the booth. ""He's tellin' me to throw onions and garlic in my socks-- I ain’t with all that! Hand me some TheraFlu, some NyQuil or something."" Small joys, but real ones that give Wu-Block a rap Statler-and-Waldorf feel.

The idea of bastardizing existing forms appears to hold great appeal for Kansas City musician Matt Hill, who records schlocky instrumental fare indebted to a broad range of Z-grade giallo peddlers under the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29264-umberto/"">Umberto</a> name. His prior work, of which the deathly <a href=""http://www.notnotfun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Not Not Fun</a> LP <i>Prophecy of the Black Widow</i> was a highlight, provided, in Hill's own words, ""soundtracks to films that don't exist"". There still isn't a bona fide soundtrack that bears the Umberto name, but he took one step closer to realizing that dream by performing the music on <i>Night Has a Thousand Screams</i> to a screening of <i>Pieces</i> at the Glasgow Music and Film Festival earlier this year. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"">Mogwai</a>'s Stuart Braithwaite was in attendance at the screening, and subsequently offered to release the music on his <a href=""http://www.rock-action.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rock Action</a> imprint. The results are a fractional advance on what came before, with the blood running a little thicker and brighter than prior Umberto releases.</p>
<p>To draw on an analogy from the film work to which Hill is so clearly enthralled, <i>Night of a Thousand Screams</i> is like picking up a copy of Buddy Giovinazzo's masterfully frayed <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090866/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Combat Shock</i></a> after gorging on the base slice and dice chills of the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080761/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Friday the 13th </i></a> series. <i>Prophecy'</i>s opening cut, ""Temple Room"", was a piece of <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Claudio+Simonetti"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Claudio Simonetti</a> worship that was both a little too in awe of its source and lacking in the necessary tools to make it ooze under your skin. In short, it felt like a tinny replica cowering in the wake of a far bolder creation. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Goblin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Goblin</a>'s work was purposefully big, with every power chord designed to hammer into your chest. It's no wonder <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2223-justice/"">Justice</a> found so much much fertile territory to mine from the band's output on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15966-audio-video-disco/"">Audio, Video, Disco</a>.</i> Hill has wisely chosen not to match Simonetti at his game here, instead edging toward the low rent chills of Italian soundtrack master <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Fabio+Frizzi"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fabio Frizzi</a>, in particular his superior <i>City of the Living Dead</i> score. </p>
<p>The influence of Frizzi is primarily manifested in the choral work, presumably lifted from Hill's sample library. It's a great sweep of male humming that resurfaces at pertinent points in the record, reaching a maximal crescendo during the appropriately named final track, ""End Credits"". <i>Night Has a Thousand Screams</i> is structured around subtly repeating motifs like that, subtly bringing back small keyboard parts to mirror the way a horror film will often return to its central theme song. At its worst it borders on a barely palatable mesh of kitsch and homage, such as the cheap <a href=""http://www.ghostbox.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghost Box</a> knock-off ""Paralyzed"". It's when Hill reaches into purposefully more restrained areas that the album picks up its eerie glow. ""The Puzzle"" is a brief, beatless passage full of cold vapors; ""The Pool"" is even better, combining thudding keys with further choral enhancements that briefly make it sound like a lost <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000877/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lamberto Bava</a> score composed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"">Popol Vuh</a>.</p>
<p>Similar moments of inspiration arise sporadically on <i>Night Has a Thousand Screams</i>, but the overall feel is often tugged down by Hill's tendency to lapse into genre exercises. He creates his own world through work like ""The Waterbed"", which succeeds by melding sparse, hissy textures with a sudden jolt into a stiffly mechanized final third full of siren wails. In a market flooded with electronic acts reaching toward horror soundtrack work to fulfill their ""dark"" remit, it often feels like supply is far outweighing demand, making it hard to stand out from the pack. Hill's work is steadily gaining its own hue, and this album is a step toward a recognizable Umberto sound that won't instantly be tagged with all the influences he so adores. It's interesting that he's had a minor breakthrough by having some visual stimulus to compose around. A fully-fledged soundtrack assignment might push him even harder to create his own recognizable strain of musical terror.</p></div>"|17385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17385-night-has-a-thousand-screams/|6.1|Nick Neyland

It took seeing a spellbinding live performance in Germany and the arrival of their latest album to convince me I was wrong. From there, I delved into their back catalog. Their earlier material generally stays the course of straightforward depressive black metal-- it doesn't get much grimmer than an<a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Ildjarn/382"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Ildjarn</a> tribute album-- but somewhere around 2007's <i>Negative Megalomania</i>, the band's sound began to shift, and a more dynamic, even rock-based approach took over. That's not to say Forgotten Tomb pulled a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1274-darkthrone/"" target=""_blank"">Darkthrone</a> and started aping Manilla Road, but there was a definite spring in their step that hadn't been there previously. They carried that frosty bounce through to their next couple records, and now, on <i>…And Don't Deliver Us From Evil</i>, they've hit their groove.</p>
<p>Opener ""Deprived"", kicks off as full-bore black 'n' roll banger that sinks into gloomier territory halfway through then switches into post-metal mode for the remaining two minutes of shiny acoustic chords and punchy drums that merrily trip along Shoegaze Alley. And that's just the first song. There's a lot of genre blending going on here; lines blur almost faster than they register, and Forgotten Tomb have clearly got goldish-caliber attention spans on some of these tunes. The title track begins as atmospheric black metal as narrated by Attila Csihar's hoarsest of croaks then dips back into languid black 'n' roll swing. ""Cold Summer"" offers a slow, menacing shadow of their former suicidal sound, while ""Let's Torture Each Other"" is a catchy, perverted love song for shut-ins. ""Love Me Like You'd Love the Death"" is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24160-type-o-negative/"" target=""_blank"">Type O Negative</a> gothic that sees vocalist Herr Morbid abusing his vocal chords over slow, slithering blackness with doomy underpinnings. The clean, hollow vocals on ""Adrift"" are even more reminiscent of Type O's Peter Steele. ""Nullifying Tomorrow"" ends the album on a sad Katatonia-esque note-- echoes of the Swedish sadsacks can be found throughout the record, as moody rock and atmospheric black metal battle for dominance (doom and goth put up a good fight, but are ultimate quashed by melodic chords and desperate growls).</p>
<p>Forgotten Tomb are an interesting band, and one that refuses to fall into any of the neat little boxes we writers have spent so many decades getting cozy for them. They remind me of a more melancholy and less aggressive <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Faustcoven/1336"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Faustcoven</a>, or a more evolved Shining (far from a clone, they've released the record that Kvarforth &amp; Co. should've done ages ago). Their willingness to explore sounds and draw in influences from outside the approved spectrum for black metal has resulted in one hell of a good record, one that continues to grow with every listen. Their roots still show from time to time, but it's become apparent that Forgotten Tomb have outgrown their depressive shackles and, unlike many of their peers, embraced evolution.</p></div>"|17382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17382-and-dont-deliver-us-from-evil/|7.5|Kim Kelly

In-between, there are tense silences, horror-movie strings, and 20-minute songs without verses or choruses. At the center of it all is an old man wailing about cutting off his own balls and feeding them to someone. The man seems to think this is some kind of opera. He is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"" target=""_blank"">Scott Walker</a>, and he puts the situation to us like this: ""I've severed my reeking gonads/ Fed them to your shrunken face.""</p>
<p>""Gonads"" and ""sever"" are good indications of the vocabulary and subject matter at work here. Like Walker's last two albums-- 1995's <i>Tilt</i> and 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8764-the-drift/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Drift</i></a>-- <i>Bish Bosch</i> is austere, high-minded music about a dirty world where people always seem to be getting castrated or mutilated by something or another. It features drums and guitars and other passing references to rock music, but its deepest roots are in the dissonant, turn-of-the century compositions by Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Webern, and Berg-- music that divided its early audiences between applause, hissing, and laughter. More than anything Walker's latter-day albums sound like a parody of what people probably think of when they think of ""avant-garde."" No scene captures them better than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEYWGQMqC74"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video footage</a> taken during the recording of <i>The Drift</i>, in which Walker-- a friendly looking man in a baseball hat-- instructs a percussionist on exactly how he would like him to punch a side of beef.</p>
<p>The story of Walker's career is a strange and amazing one. He grew up in Ohio but spent most of his life in England and Europe. He was cover-boy famous by his early 20s and a has-been by 30. Between 1967 and 1969 he released a series of orchestral pop albums whose stories about Joseph Stalin and childhood prostitution contrasted-- sometimes beautifully, sometimes just cynically-- with their high-gloss arrangements. No man has ever sung the word <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=R9u9K7Up4Ts#t=82s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""gonorrhea""</a> with more poise.</p>
<p>Between the 1970s and 1990s, he effectively disappeared, putting out a few sub-mediocre country albums, a few new songs with his former group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4960-the-walker-brothers/"" target=""_blank"">the Walker Brothers</a> (including <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmRVU-MEXU0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Electrician""</a>, which is really the starting point for the music he's making now), and 1984's <i>Climate of Hunter. </i>The output of his unexpected second act-- <i>Tilt</i>, <i>The Drift</i>, and now <i>Bish Bosch-- </i>have taken 20 years to record. Scarcity creates demand-- this is basic economics. With an artist like Walker, though, long waiting times between albums serve mostly to reinforce the idea that he is careful and deliberate, and in turn, the idea that his music is not just product, but that purest of things which cannot be rushed: Art.</p>
<p>Besides the appropriately exhausting 20-minute sweep of ""SDSS14+13B (Zercon, A Flagpole Sitter)"", the best songs on Bish Bosch-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48512-listen-to-two-tracks-from-scott-walkers-new-album/"" target=""_blank"">""'See You Don't Bump His Head'""</a>, ""Corps De Blah"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48523-watch-scott-walkers-strange-slow-motion-clip-for-the-ten-minute-bish-bosch-cut-epizootics/"" target=""_blank"">""Epizootics!""</a>-- are also the most immediate. Walker's approach here, especially compared to <i>Tilt</i> and <i>The Drift</i>, is almost cartoonish: Big, bouncy saxophones, bright trumpet fanfares and, on ""Corps"", what sounds like a small dog barking. These songs work for one simple reason: In the midst of all Walker's void-courting experimentation, they give listeners something vaguely familiar to hang on to.</p>
<p>Here and there, the contrast between the brainy and the base is so deliberate it sounds like pandering. When Walker sings “If shit were music, you'd be a brass band!"" on ""Zercon"", for example, he's probably trying to remind people that this is all supposed to be on some level funny, which makes it instantly less funny-- not to mention less tragic-- than the Walker who sang lines like ""I've become a giant, I fill every street/ I dwarf the rooftops, I hunchback the moon, stars dance at my feet"" in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QCBD_Lj2S4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a song about an overworked husband whose only liberation in life comes from whores</a>. <i></i></p>
<p>As much as it can sound like it stands alone, <i>Bish Bosch</i> is part of a tradition of music that tried to find new ways to articulate that same old misery. Wagner operas, Mahler symphonies, the brutal cabaret of Jacques Brel (who Walker covered extensively in the 1960s), David Bowie, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1672-diamanda-galas/"" target=""_blank"">Diamanda Galás</a>, the aggressive anti-music of no wave, even early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a>: this is music that doesn't sound exactly like Scott Walker but makes Walker's bleakness and theatricality sound that much more familiar. <i>Bish Bosch</i> is difficult music that was intended to sound difficult and be enjoyed primarily by people who enjoy difficult experiences. The irony is that it is difficult in conventional ways.</p>
<p>Walker's career has always been surrounded with the whispery, romantic myth of genius, and we need myths like that-- myths about people who seem to forge their own path into the wilderness of their art, slowly and alone. The danger is to pretend that the music exists somewhere above us, or, like a carnival ride, is something we have to be This Smart to understand.</p>
<p>Like the movie director David Lynch, Walker is an artist that people-- fans and non-fans-- seem bent on ""getting,"" as though there was anything to ""get"" in the first place. Let's pretend there isn't. Let's pretend that when Walker tells a ""you're so fat"" joke halfway through ""Zercon"", it's not a metaphor for anything, but an insult about fat people.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, he breaks down and starts screaming, ""Did you ever throw your own mother's food back at her? Did you ever tell her 'Take this junk away'? What kind of an unnatural son would do that to his own mother?"" Let's pretend that the moment has nothing to do with 5th-century Moorish history or the astronomy behind brown dwarf stars. Let's pretend it's simpler than that. Behind all its obscure references and theatrics, <i>Bish Bosch</i> is a catalog of basic human cruelty-- a subject no footnote could ever make any easier to understand.</p></div>"|17387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17387-bish-bosch/|8.0|Mike Powell

The free mixtape's direct line of communication from artist to listener, unimpeded by A&amp;R execs, and the anarchic, genre-smashing creative approach that it engenders feel very compatible with the times, and with XCX's internet-mashing creative hybrids. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48504-download-charli-xcxs-super-ultra-mixtape/"" target=""_blank""><i>Super Ultra</i></a> is the second one she's released this year, after spring's <i>Heartbreaks and Earthquakes</i>, and it's an interesting experiment, if far from flawless.</p>
<p>The eight-track EP opens on a low note-- probably its lowest-- with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48638-watch-charli-xcx-and-brooke-candys-cloud-aura-video-featuring-britney-spears-honey-boo-boo/"" target=""_blank"">a track featuring internet personality Brooke Candy</a>, who is best known for appearing in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a>' music video for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/directors-cut/8929-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">""Genesis""</a> and has a sideline in being a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHULK1M-P08"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">terrible rapper</a>. The beat has a pleasing blunted feel and a catchy hook driven by a funky keyboard riff, but Candy's contribution sounds like the female half of a discarded turn-of-the-millennium Ja Rule duet, down to the outdated slang and submissive-chick role she plays in her lyrics. With her nasal voice and awkwardly-fitting accent she comes off like the female Mickey Avalon who, much like Mickey Avalon, no-one who actually likes rap music could possibly enjoy in any unironic way. ""Heatwave"" offers a convincing recreation of a brand of 80s electroclash that's been redone a vast number of times since the genre's heyday, while the droopy ""Moments in Love"" suggests that Charli might be better off with a supervisory eye looking over her shoulder. (If there wasn't one-- the presence of a link to Atlantic's UK division at the bottom of the page that homes <i>Super Ultra</i> suggests that it's not entirely free of label ties.)</p>
<p>But there are a few bright moments on <i>Super Ultra</i>. ""Velvet Dreaming (Luv)"" is spacey and ravey in a way that bears more than a passing resemblance to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/"" target=""_blank"">the Orb</a>'s ""Little Fluffy Clouds"", and the ecstatic synthesizer crescendo accompanied by an extended sample of dialogue from <i>True Romance</i> that pops up 30 seconds in would likely have gotten it the axe if she'd tried placing it on an album for a label. The same goes for ""Glow"", which has a beat that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> and a weary, dissipated vocal that doesn't fit the established outlines of a pop star personality.</p>
<p>And then there's the record-closing ""Forgiveness"", which is legitimately gorgeous and weird. It begins as a plaintive piano ballad before waves of strings and drums sweep over and it transforms into a minor-key dirge. It's awash in vocal effects that suggest some sort of emotional breakdown, along with an insistent cowbell that somehow feels vaguely maniacal and menacing in the context of everything that's going on. Charli's vocals show off all of her star-worthy talents, but the lyrics go deeper than self-doubt, all the way down to self-loathing and a raw, unembellished portrait of a dark psychic space. After listening a dozen times I realized that it most reminded me of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3139-of-montreal/"" target=""_blank"">of Montreal</a>'s epic meltdown ""The Past is a Grotesque Animal"". ""Forgiveness"" is a fascinatingly strange song, and who knows if it would have made it onto <i>Super Ultra</i> if it had been intended to shift units on a pop star level. In any case, it's a compelling argument for letting these kind of pop stars off the leash.</p></div>"|17457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17457-super-ultra/|5.0|Miles Raymer

The sheer amount of time William Bennett spent terrorizing audiences as part of the long-running noise outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4765-whitehouse/"">Whitehouse</a> suggested he would be the last person to land in such a place. But, as the 2011 album by his self-styled ""afro-noise"" project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29847-cut-hands/"">Cut Hands</a> demonstrated, even someone with a fondness for calling songs ""I'm Comin' Up Your Ass"" is capable of growing old with a certain amount of grace. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15699-afro-noise-i/""><i>Afro Noise I</i></a> wasn't exactly commercial-- Bennett won't be bothering the Top 40 any time soon-- but anyone expecting to hear a saw-toothed desecration of the African music he was citing as a key influence was left empty handed. On <i>Black Mamba</i>, which follows the lead of its predecessor by tying together a collection of new and previously released material, those rough edges are flattened out even further.</p>
<p>The major factor that ties the Cut Hands material to Bennett's work in Whitehouse is in his fondness for the straightforward. There's a sledgehammer-like simplicity to his other band's bludgeoning. Here, nothing splinters off in an unexpected direction, or ends up in a place radically different from whence it came. The standout cut is the title track, possibly the most groove-oriented work Bennett has ever released, where cacophonic beats are driven through carefully plotted tempo changes. There isn't much more to it other than a series of looped drum sounds going to war with one another, but it's an exhausting and exhilarating ride, and one that fully delivers on the promise of the similarly inclined <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/selftitledmag/cut-hands-stabbers-conspiracy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stabbers Conspiracy""</a> from the prior Cut Hands album. That we don’t get to return to the feel of ""Black Mamba"" is a shame, although after years of working in Whitehouse's one-mode world it's perhaps unsurprising to see Bennett taking the chance to stretch out. </p>
<p>A theme that binds both Cut Hands records, and sweeps back to Whitehouse's 2007 album Racket (which bore a barely perceptible African influence), is a series of tracks that bear the name ""Nzambi"". Here, ""Nzambi la Ngonde"" and ""Nzambi la Muini"" consist of washy ambient passages, with both edging away from prickly beginnings by picking up a glassy texture reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>. The album oscillates between that kind of rudderless drifting and more layered, beat-oriented work. Occasionally it's a little too basic. ""No Spare No Soul"" spends too long with a beat echoing in place before Bennett dumps a batch of digital discord onto its second half. ""Brown-Brown"" is better, subtly building off a fidgety sound source that resembles someone hammering a rhythm out on a skeletal rib cage.</p>
<p>The bulk of <i>Black Mamba</i> is positioned in a more equable place than the album that preceded it, although it might be better received now that Bennett's fans have had more time to adjust to this mindset. Still, a track like ""54 Needles"" may come as a shock, especially as it's hard not to reach for an adjective like ""cloying"" when trying to describe it. Whitehouse may be many things, but sentimental certainly isn't one of them. At this point it's better to look at Cut Hands as an entity unto itself that occasionally bears scars torn from a previous life. Tellingly, <i>Black Mamba</i> becomes more robust when Bennett slings one of those hooks into the sound. It's there in the seething pessimism that pours out of ""Erzulie D'en Tort"" and it's there in the blackout beats that stack up unremittingly on the title track. Cut Hands may find Bennett in surprise user-friendly mode, but it succeeds most often when he gives up the fight against familiar feelings of tension and confrontation.</p></div>"|17444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17444-black-mamba/|6.8|Nick Neyland

""I feel like in other cities there might be more of a separation from the different crews or different scenes, whereas in Detroit people are supporting each other just by default so they have something to do on a Saturday night,"" frontman Kevin Boyer <a href=""http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/WebExclusive/tyvek/Page/2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. ""It's definitely a survivor kind of city."" In the past, something like ""survivalism"" made itself apparent in the band's near-hardcore aggression, especially on their 2010 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14860-nothing-fits/"" target=""_blank"">Nothing Fits</a></i>. That's still present for <i>On Triple Beams</i>, but in a key moment, they soften somewhat to deliver a unifying anthem for Detroit's punks, nerds, and audiophiles fighting for something to do on Saturday night.</p>
<p>That anthem is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14554-wayne-county-roads/"" target=""_blank"">""Wayne County Roads""</a>, which takes its name from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_County,_Michigan"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the greater Detroit area</a>. The song's title is chanted in response to the line, ""Can you explain to me just how we get home?"" It's a song not about the sort of ""white flight"" city desertion from the history books, but about recent, specific young people ditching the city for other places. ""Friends that I hold so dear, it's sad to report/ Not hardly one soul around to defend the fort."" It's a depressing notion, but the title is chanted as a sort of rallying cry-- there are fewer soldiers around, but that's all the more reason to fucking <i>do something</i>.</p>
<p>Appropriately, the song comes right after a track called ""City of a Dream"", which discusses the recent efforts to ""rebuild"" Detroit. Boyer's view of the current situation is cynical, though he sings it over a cheerful progression: ""City of a dream, but it's just a lie/ You can write about it in the Sunday Times."" But aside from the standard bitterness seemingly directed at politicians and the media, there are glimpses at real life in the city, like working at <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/temple-bar-detroit"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Temple Bar</a> or the movie theater. If the allusions to the big picture make <i>On Triple Beams</i> feel contemporary or significant, it's the descriptions of ""Midwest Basements"" and the <a href=""http://mocadetroit.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MOCAD</a> namedrop that make it feel special.</p>
<p>And since it's Tyvek we're talking about here, most of the tracks emanate urgency in nearly every respect. The guitars are buzzy and loud, the rhythms are quick, the drums crash, the lyrics are densely packed into a short span of time, and Boyer spits them out with punk rock confidence. His words are often eloquent, but sometimes, shit's just too frustrating for poetry. On ""Little Richard"", he sings about not being able to afford rent or heat, which eventually leads to, ""Click clack click clack click clack FUCK/ We've got a live one, we've got a live one!"" It's a simple, understandable descent into nonsensical anger.</p>
<p>More often than not, tackling current events on a punk record can end with corny and terrible results. But Boyer and Tyvek succeed because they don't set out to make a condescending, chastising political record. Yes, they allude to the current state of Detroit, but they also reference what sound like personal details from their own lives: friends moving out of town, sleeping in Midwestern basements, getting drunk, forcing the band into the van by 3pm, working tomorrow with Steve, etc. It's not a romantic view of Detroit at all, but idealism has never been Tyvek's thing. Do they offer a great reason to come to town and support the local scene? Hell no. But that's not what they're trying to do. With their urgent, sometimes aggressive, sometimes anthemic delivery, they show us Detroit from their vantage point.</p></div>"|17411.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17411-on-triple-beams/|8.0|Evan Minsker

Like bank robbers on a job or mercenaries on a mission, the British quartet appears uniformly in balaclavas; the holes in the fabric are invitations of intrigue about the minds, lives and pasts of the four anonymous members. And when they play live, the musicians turn their backs on the audience, closing themselves to the house to again invoke wonder about just what they’re doing. Those conditions certainly aren't new for heavy metal, a genre replete with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQl6PzXU4cQ&amp;feature=player_embedded"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one-man bands</a>, figure-obscuring <a href=""http://media.thelineofbestfit.com/wp-content/media/2009/08/sunn_ss09.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">robes</a>, and <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Blut_aus_Nord/2371"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pioneers</a> who've still never performed in public. Coupled, however, with Dragged into Sunlight's forthright willingness to not only tour but also discuss its intentions and influences and irritations with the world, they do create a strangely magnetic allure, conjuring the idea of a band allegiant to its name-- a dark figure, reluctantly forced into public view to share its grim view of the world. ""Our inspiration is very much a natural creation, spurred from months, if not years, of frustrated murderous intent,"" <a href=""http://www.metallomusikum.com/2012/04/interview-dragged-into-sunlight-tells.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the band told Metallomusikum last year.</a> ""Imagine each micro-social interaction stuffed into one massive wrecking ball. Every time someone pissed you off and you wanted to tear their jaw off, concealed, building and ready to burst at any moment."" Who else would you rather rage with?</p>
<p>This public chiaroscuro seems to be one reason that Dragged into Sunlight's second LP, <i>Widowmaker</i>, has been so righteously anticipated: Here is a band, after all, of purported but unnamed extreme metal veterans, willing to take potshots at most anyone in interviews and back it with their own agitated magpie music. Indeed, 2009's <i>Hatred for Mankind</i> offered a potent recombination of death metal, black metal, shocking samples, and relentless production. On the memorably named ""Lashed to the Grinder and Stoned to Death"", for example, Dragged into Sunlight plunged through hideous doom depths only to reemerge with both speed and vigor, a four-piece thrashing as one against the world. In interviews, Dragged into Sunlight griped about the metal community's ever-growing mold of stylistic conformity; on tape, they seemed capable of more than complaints, a band capable of actually sounding, well, new. </p>
<p><i>Widowmaker</i> suffers from that sensation. Due to factors like other jobs, other bands, and the 300-mile geographical spread between the members, Dragged into Sunlight has been working on <i>Widowmaker</i>-- a three-part, 40-minute suite intended as one piece of music-- for three years. Both the process and ambition show as seams here, meaning that these 40 minutes sound like a cycle through influences and an unrealized aspiration to unite them under one release. Late last year, <a href=""http://www.decibelmagazine.com/featured/dragged-into-sunlight-qa-uk-extremists-on-indivisibility-influences-and-hunting-amplifiers/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talking to Decibel about the just-finished record</a>, the band rolled through a list of <i>Widowmaker</i> touchstones-- ""It's doom-- there are influences from Eyehategod, Grief-- but then there's some thrashier elements, and there's a bit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1943-high-on-fire/"" target=""_blank"">High on Fire</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30079-trap-them/"" target=""_blank"">Trap Them</a>, even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3222-om/"" target=""_blank"">Om</a> in there, too."" Those components are all clearly identifiable here, from Part Three's down-tuned downturn to Part Two's sudden circle pit initiation. For the first 15 minutes, Dragged into Sunlight even does its best <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"" target=""_blank"">Godspeed</a>, weaving a somber guitar around whispers of stately violin, down-the-abyss traces of noise, and recordings of serial killers talking about the rewards of their work. It's an interesting piece, but when it ends, Dragged into Sunlight flips a switch of convenience by plowing instantly into the howls and wallops of death metal. That's the net effect of <i>Widowmaker</i>, an album that finds Dragged into Sunlight working through strong parts of doom or thrash, noise or drone but never actually welding them into one. Widowmaker is named for, <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/10665-dragged-into-sunlight-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as the band told <i>The Quietus</i></a>, a heartache that ""builds and builds and your heart is basically exploding."" But the album itself is more akin to vertigo, with the stylistic disconnects and sudden switches making the record as a whole forgettable at best and vexing at worst.</p>
<p><i>Widowmaker</i> isn't without its rewards: Toward the end of the three-part suite, the band repeatedly cycles through near-silence (a lugubrious field recording from the Czech Republic's Bone Church circles like a sinister breeze) and the record's most furious bursts. Despite Dragged into Sunlight's insistence on being identified as one unit, these moments offer some of the album’s most motivated and moving performances. A skittering drum solo, for instance, lifts the whole band through a drone and into a phosphorescent surge; during another relatively calm pass, the guitar’s tone and patience are enviable, the slowly rising riff setting a paradoxically grim but inviting scene. And in Part Two, they dart around a serial killer's ramblings, spotlighting the unease as he talks about himself as a mass murderer. These bursts renew <i>Hatred for Mankind</i>'s promise of fresh invective. </p>
<p>But by and large, <i>Widowmaker</i> hoists Dragged into Sunlight with their own petard, turning that once-welcome eclecticism and adventurousness into the weapon that disrupts the payoff. It's not that these 40 minutes are too extreme or overly dependent on too many ideas; it's that Dragged into Sunlight haven't found out how to synthesize their best impulses and broad ambitions into a whole. The parts generally work, but they rarely work together. And from a band that insists upon the collective identity mattering much more than the constituent parts, that's an outcome equivalent to, as they might put it, ""frustrated murderous intent.""</p></div>"|17381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17381-widowmaker/|6.2|Grayson Currin

Nearly every song offers a sound currently in use in music's taste-making leading edge. Robert ""3D"" Del Naja's chopped-up vocals on the album-opening ""Safe From Harm"" sound freakishly like the chorus to Kanye et al's ""Mercy"" (even if Ye actually lifted it from DJ Screw, who was developing his idiosyncratic style 5,000 miles away from Bristol, England at almost the exact same time Massive were recording <i>Blue Lines</i>). The chunky, palm-muted guitar riff on ""One Love"" is almost identical to the one on ""Ahh Shit"" from Jeremih's brilliant <i>Late Nights with Jeremih</i>. The subzero space-reggae beat to ""Five Man Army"" could easily be a highlight of any number of fashionable rappers' mixtapes. </p>
<p class=""p1"">When Del Najas, Grant ""Daddy G"" Marshall, and Andrew ""Mushroom"" Vowles were recording <i>Blue Lines</i>, the sub-genre called trip-hop hadn't been invented. But at its heart, <i>Blue Lines</i> is a hip-hop record, although one marbled with streaks of soul, dub, dance music, and psychedelic rock. The fact that its primary audience in America was made up largely of ravers and alternative rockers doesn't change that. And their accomplishments stand out even further next to what was happening elsewhere in the hip-hop world at the time. <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, <i>It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back</i>, <i>Paul's Boutique</i>, and <i>3 Feet High and Rising</i> were all still just a few of years old in 1991, and so was the idea of beatmaking as an art unto itself. The blocky rhythms and minimal arrangements that defined rap's identity in the 1980s were just starting to be replaced by the deep, organic textures that would define its 90s, and <i>Blue Lines</i> was at the forefront. </p>
<p class=""p1"">When Massive Attack first arrived, hip-hop in the UK was still figuring itself out. For years the scene there, such as it was, focused mainly on reproducing trends that had already fallen out of fashion by the time they made it across the Atlantic. That lack of identity was probably an asset for Massive Attack. They didn't have to compete against their contemporaries to see who could sample which Jimmy Castor Bunch break first, or worry about conforming to any outsider whose preconceptions about hip-hop authenticity might not include prog-rock samples or a lush chill-out anthem like ""Unfinished Sympathy"". Another asset was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11116-neneh-cherry/"" target=""_blank"">Neneh Cherry</a>, whose <i>Raw Like Sushi</i>, which Del Naja and Vowles worked on, provided a genre-bending inspiration for <i>Blue Lines</i>, as well as a bankroll to record it. (Cherry even paid the group a salary and let them turn her kid's bedroom into an impromptu studio.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">In fact, those <i>Raw Like Sushi</i> credits (Vowles' for programming, Del Naja's for co-writing ""Manchild"") were the only real music-industry bona fides any of the principal contributors to <i>Blue Lines</i> had going into it, aside from vocalists Shara Nelson and roots reggae veteran Horace Andy. But somehow the group realized a remarkable and seamless sonic identity. That's clear from the arresting opener ""Safe From Harm"", which spins an aggressive drumbeat, Del Naja's rap, Nelson's soulful vocals, and a mist of sustained minor-key synths around an intimidatingly muscular bass loop. From that moment, every major part of the Massive Attack profile is already present, from the collaging of genres to the spacious, nocturnal sonic environment to the heavy dose of paranoia that permeates it all.</p>
<p class=""p1"">They spend the rest of the album exploring variations on these themes. ""One Love,"" with Andy on vocals, has a digital dancehall feel, a creepy-funky electric piano riff, and a scratched sample of a blaring horn section that predates Pharoahe Monch's ""Simon Says"" by almost a decade. ""Daydreaming"", with its scratchy breakbeat drums, is more directly hip-hop than most of the rest of the album, but the layers of atmospheric synthesizers and Tricky's felonious near-whisper make it clear that Massive Attack was up to something entirely different from what every other rap producer at the time was doing.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Blue Lines</i> brought producers around to its unique vision. By the time Massive released <i>Protection</i> three years later, the group's renegade approach had been copied enough times to become a full-on movement. They'd go on to produce their masterpiece, Mezzanine, a couple of years after, but by then the project had already started to splinter. Tricky split from the collective after <i>Protection</i> to follow his own solo vision, while the core trio behind it would eventually burn out acrimoniously, with Vowles and then Marshall leaving Del Naja to produce increasingly less rewarding music under the group's name. Meanwhile, trip-hop in general had its edges polished off by genteel musicians who transformed it into soundtracks for fashionable hotel lobbies.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Still, that doesn't change the fact that <i>Blue Lines</i> was a startling record when it came out, and it remains one now. For this reissue it received a new mix and a new mastering job straight from the original tapes. It's available as a CD, in digital form in standard and high fidelity formats, and as a set of two LPs and a DVD of high resolution audio files. There aren't any bonus tracks, and aside from a reproduction promo poster in the vinyl edition there aren't any add-ons either. Frankly they'd just be a distraction from the underlying theme that becomes clear once you get absorbed into the music, which is that <i>Blue Lines</i> is still <i>Blue Lines</i>, and most of the world is still trying to catch up to it. </p></div>"|17384.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17384-blue-lines-remastered-box-set/|9.0|Miles Raymer

Without vocals and without an instrument that you can manipulate with your body, it's harder to insert ""you"" into the music. And harder still to have that ""you"" be so thoroughly ""you"" that listeners pick up on it and can identify you from your sonics alone. Both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Hecker</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30721-daniel-lopatin/"" target=""_blank"">Daniel Lopatin</a> (better known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>) have gotten there. Each has his own aesthetic and you can hear them inside of it. Hecker's is more immediately identifiable. Since 2001's <i>Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again</i>, he's created a run of good-to-amazing albums that are typically built on static and shifting drones, number-crunching music that is also intensely physical and tactile. Lopatin's approach is comparatively playful and also more steeped in appropriation, as he finds ways to incorporate the cast-off music of the past and make something that is both affecting and very much of this moment. When listening to a record by either Hecker or Lopatin, you get a strong sense of the minds and sensibilities behind the music.</p>
<p>Hecker and Lopatin admire each other's work and move in some of the same circles. Earlier this year, at Lopatin's urging, they got together to experiment. Crucially, they were actually in the same room together for the project, sharing sketches and creating new music in real time. When so much music is being made by sharing files online, the fact that they actually played together and improvised is unusual and gives the album a unique quality. Here and there you can hear artifacts from the sessions, like the ""Are you ready? We're recording..."" voices very quietly at the opening of ""Vaccination (for Thomas Mann)"", which reinforce the air of spontaneity. One precedent for this sort of project comes from artists both producers admire, the collaborations between Christian Fennesz, Jim O'Rourke, and Peter Rehberg under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28542-fenn-oberg/"" target=""_blank"">Fenn O'Berg</a>. But while those collaborations could be dense and heavily abstract, <i>Instrumental Tourist</i> is an easy listen, loaded with billowy atmosphere and discernible melody.</p>
<p>It's almost eerie in how you can hear the melding of two sounds. On tracks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14550-intrusions/"" target=""_blank"">""Intrusions""</a>, ""Grey Geisha"", and ""Vaccination No. 2"", Hecker's blown-out digital shoegaze forms the basis of the tracks while Lopatin adds quasi global accents on top. On tracks like ""Vaccination (for Thomas Mann)"" and ""Racist Drone"", Lopatin's thinner new age tones dominate and the accents are Hecker's. The overall mood drifts from lightly narcotic bliss to mild tension and then back again, but the album hangs together. The way these things usually work, it's unlikely that every ""Hecker-like"" sound comes from him and vice-versa. But it's uncanny how much these tracks sound like two guys jamming and bringing their individual voices into a shared context. </p>
<p>For someone deeply attuned to these guys' careers, listening for their individual contributions is both fun and slightly distracting. They sound good together and the meshing of their sounds is seamless, but both are known more for meticulously crafted tracks honed over long periods of time, and albums that string tracks together in a coherent way. <i>Instrumental Tourist</i>, while listenable, doesn't hide its more sketch-driven beginnings. It's an album more about process; you feel like you are hearing something at the moment of creation and, relative to the recent full-lengths these two have made on their own, there's less of a pull to return to the music and see how it all works. It's also, at 55 minutes, on the long side, and there aren't quite enough ideas being batted back and forth to justify the length. But it's an enjoyable detour, one that affirms how well these producers have honed their approaches to sound. </p></div>"|17327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17327-instrumental-tourist/|7.5|Mark Richardson

When most every gig seems to work its way onto YouTube, and when unreleased tracks act as fresh bait for legal downloads, one expects that most groups aren’t sitting on enough fully formed but unheard songs to necessitate such stopgaps. The internet demands its content like grist for the mill, so that quality often succumbs to quantity. An unearthed demo, an alternate take, or a discarded remix best left in obscurity can get a band back in the attention cycle, whether or not it's worth anyone's actual while. If you've got the tunes, why not put them to use?</p>
<p>That idea, or the negation of it, is one reason that <i>From the Vaults</i>-- a collection of 12 unreleased or rare tunes and teases, recorded by Southern metal bushwhackers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10043-kylesa/"" target=""_blank"">Kylesa</a> between 2005 and 2012-- seems so refreshing. Recorded in the studio of co-founder Phillip Cope, the dozen takes are every bit as crafted as those on Kylesa's increasingly excellent five studio albums, with tones both enormous and exploratory and vocals both large and enthusiastic. Many of these songs have been released before in some limited format, but nothing here sounds like it was readymade for an ephemera stockpile.</p>
<p>In fact, some of these numbers stand as inarguable highlights in an already-impressive catalogue: ""Paranoid Tempo"", for instance, churns through its two-and-a-half minutes of perfect pop-metal, Cope and Laura Pleasants trading lead vocals and textural harmonies like they're going to Halloween as Mates of State. Kylesa and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/"" target=""_blank"">Torche</a> once got mentioned in the same Southern metal trend pieces, more as a result of geographic proximity than sound. Here, though, Kylesa one-ups the bubblegum tenacity of their Miami counterparts with twisted sonics pirouetting around an unfailing hook. Meanwhile, the lopsided structure and antiphonal clash of the guitars and howls during ""Inverse"" afford Kylesa a Godflesh-like urgency; but Kylesa's two-drummer configuration enables around-the-beat flourishes, rewiring the robot back into a righteous rock band. </p>
<p>Kylesa smartly handles this mix of material like an album, with the turgid lurk of the collection's one ""new"" track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14403-end-truth/"" target=""_blank"">""End Truth""</a> bisecting the blessed pop-metal of ""Paranoid Tempo"" and the hardcore-baiting rage of ""Bottom Line II"". Just as Kylesa have employed slow-building gambits, moody interludes, and closing instrumentals on their proper LPs, they open with a pensive full-band jam, insert a minute-long atmospheric recess, and end with a fairly incredible ""Drum Jam"" that variably suggests Steve Reich, the Grateful Dead, the Rolling Stones, and Dennis Chambers. Though the choice to sequester the set's only covers (a malevolent, marrow-scraping take on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9uYhXYJf_I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buzzov-en's ""Drained""</a> and an ascendant version of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5_0iZQ-TuA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pink Floyd's ""Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun""</a>) might seem like an obvious concession to typical odds-and-sods formats, the pair actually ends <i>From the Vaults</i> on notes both awesome and telling: Though Kylesa is rooted in the viscous Southern metal that Buzzov-en has made so aggressively for decades, they are fascinating because they've extended beyond those roots, adding psychedelic and industrial and pop influences to their music en masse. These covers trace that lineage, forming a progressive arrow that parallels the investigative nature of Kylesa's music. <i>From the Vaults</i>, then, provides context and content.</p>
<p>Kylesa has never been a casual band: During the last decade, <a href=""http://www.okgazette.com/oklahoma/article-4505-dual-drumming-savannah-sludge-rockers-kylesa-overhaul-sound.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">they've survived the death of a member</a>, multiple shifts in label alliances, and that moment a few years back <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/metal-garden-good-and-evil"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">when people romantically spoke about Savannah and the swampy South like the new Seattle</a>. Despite it all, they've become the rare act that seems both tied to the sound of their geography and inherently interested in expanding it, too. Their commitment to those ends are epitomized by <i>From the Vaults</i>, a collection that shows a band that's spent the last seven years building a bulkhead of interesting music that extends beyond proper LPs.

An essential part of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a> live experience, Russom is a man who takes music seriously, and knows more about the mechanics of what he does than even your most dedicated connoisseur. For all his high concepts, though, he's had trouble translating his ideas into appealing music. His latest offering with vocalist and visual artist Viva Ruiz, the disco-house hybrid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30683-the-crystal-ark/"" target=""_blank"">the Crystal Ark</a> just isn't consistently interesting, an unfortunate fact for fans of DFA, who, along with the label's characteristic sheen, expect memorable songs like the ones they get from Shit Robot and Holy Ghost!.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Though everything on the group's self-titled debut is well-engineered, with track segments that sound practiced, and clear, the songs are often discombobulated and repetitive. Songs that go on for seven or eight minutes in order to heighten excitement simply drag when there isn't much excitement to be had. That isn't to say that the music isn't technically good or at least precise. The best track here, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14407-morir-sonando/"" target=""_blank"">""Morir Soñando""</a>, is a funky head-nodder, powered by a springy baseline and trance-inducing verses on which Ruiz, along with back-up vocalists Jaiko Suzuki and Sokhna Mabin, chants about a romantic dream of love, paradise, and a land beyond. It's a dusky nighttime romp with enough thematic development to distract from relative musical stasis.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But too often, tracks slide by without supplying anything to fasten on to. Opener ""Ascension"" starts energetically with a heel-kicking synths but after about a minute it loses steam and, for the next four minutes, it drags. Those streamlined synths turn dirty and become a focal point but there's never anything that makes the song feel alive. Ditto for ""Paradise"", which, with its dial-tone staccato, continuously fools the listener into false climax without capitalizing on the energy that it builds throughout. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The worst sin that the group commits is indulgence. The two minute-long outro on ""Crossing"" is particularly aggravating, using an idea similar to ""Dueling Banjos"" while scrapping any novelty or amusement. These missteps are surprising because the Crystal Ark, while most potent as a live outfit, are capable of sounding great in the studio. Last year's single ""Touch"" was a great example of lithe disco-funk, which incorporated Russom's signature repetition while slowly building momentum. And a pair of singles from 2010, ""The Tangible Presence of the Miraculous"" and ""The City Never Sleeps"", found the right balance between rigidity and raucousness.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Those singles' descendants can be found in the last two tracks on <i>The Crystal Ark</i>. ""Rain"", the shortest song on the album, makes great use of the group's leads, as Russom and Ruiz guide pulsing funk and ribbon synths into a sexy, naturalistic chorus. And on ""Silver Cord"" Ruiz finds a particular phrasing that provides a backbone for the urgency of her backup singers. ""Vibrations they rise and fall,"" she chants, before the beat drops out from under her and she's left alone, isolated in a dark room but singing with confidence that belies the tension in the music. On these two tracks form rises to match function and they provide a helpful counterpoint to their shapeless antecedents. <i>The Crystal Ark's </i>best tracks that work are the ones that actually exude some spirit in their mission to move bodies.</p></div>"|17340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17340-the-crystal-ark/|5.6|Jonah Bromwich

It exists outside of time, allergic to trends and suspicious of new technologies, which makes it ideal for loners who feel alienated from culture. Garage rock also <i>sounds</i> solitary. If it is recorded correctly-- which is to say, if it feels like the audio was captured haphazardly by an amateur engineer in 1966-- this music will be alive and sloppy but also a little removed, particularly the vocals. You know a garage-rock band has done its homework if the lead singer can affect a Jagger-esque whine that comes off somewhat anesthetized, like he can't quite bring himself to commit fully to the song or life in general.</p>
<p>You can't accuse Los Angeles quartet<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30907-the-allah-las/"" target=""_blank""> Allah-Las</a> of not doing its homework. Three of the four members met while working at one of the country's great record stores, Amoeba on Sunset Boulevard, where they spent countless hours studying up on the vintage sounds that compose their affectingly melancholy self-titled debut. The band formed in 2008, and worked for several years painstakingly assembling the songs on <i>Allah-Las</i>, first releasing the vinyl single, ""Catamaran""/""Long Journey"", in 2011 and following up with two singles in 2012. All of these songs, plus the eight other tracks that make up <i>Allah-Las</i>, were produced by Nick Waterhouse, a fine L.A. singer-songwriter whose 2012 LP <i>Time's All Gone </i>is a spirited and record-geek friendly collection of raucous 50s-style R&amp;B thrashers.</p>
<p>Waterhouse's production aesthetic involves a lot of tubes and analog equipment and ""natural"" sounds. The idea is to give the appearance of a band bashing out a record in a matter of minutes, but the reality of the process is far more deliberate and meticulous. ""The whole lo-fi, DIY has its own appeal, and there are lots of bands we like that can make that work for them,"" Allah-Las bassist Spencer Dunham <a href=""http://www.laweekly.com/2011-08-11/music/the-allah-las-put-their-retro-where-their-mouths-are/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told the <i>L.A. Weekly</i></a> in 2011. ""But for us to make the sound that we really want, we work a lot better in a studio setting with $3,000 microphones from 1953.""</p>
<p>This means Allah-Las are even lonelier than the average garage-rock band, obsessively constructing jangly, seemingly simple mid-tempo pop songs in the studio like they're building grand pocket symphonies. The success of <i>Allah-Las </i>is that it doesn't seem like it was strained over; instead, it sounds like an effortlessly wistful batch of starry-eyed, minor-key beauties that gently ruminate on the usual young-guy subjects: sex, freedom, the ways the former can interfere with the latter and vice versa. The album's prettiest song, the Felt-like ""Vis-à-Vis"", looks back on a failed relationship with a mix of regret and fatalistic acceptance: ""Some things can't be undone/ but that doesn't mean it was all just a waste of time,"" bassist Spencer Dunham says, sounding unknowingly innocent.</p>
<p>The darker vibes lurking inside ""Sandy"", with its ""too close to the sun"" imagery, finally curdle on the album-closing ""Long Journey"", <i>Allah-Las</i>'<i> </i>most aggressive track with its tough guitar jabs and springy bassline. After stating his intention ""to find a love that'll stay,"" drummer Matt Correia fantasizes about ""heading down by the river to kill your daddy tonight/ and by the break of day, you know that we’ll be out of sight."" It sounds like a line borrowed from an old blues tune, though much of the yearning for escape on <i>Allah-Las </i>is derived from the beach. (Most of the guys in this band surf.) The seductive groove of ""Catamaran"" has a strong pull, but the instrumental ""Sacred Sands"" shows where the band's heart really is. Like so many garage-rock questers before them, Allah-Las are ultimately preoccupied with sound above all else. So long as there are 12-string guitars, four-piece drumkits, and lots and lots of reverb, the rest of the world can go away.</p></div>"|17463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17463-the-allah-las/|6.9|Steven Hyden

Einar Örn fulfilled such a role for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3971-the-sugarcubes/"">the Sugarcubes</a>, providing mazy spoken word rants that butted up against <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a>'s singular tone. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle </a>were a band of four antagonizers, an unlikely amalgam of headstrong individuals who somehow found space to work together. Their history is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11849-the-taste-of-tg-a-beginners-guide-to-the-music-of-throbbing-gristle-mutant-tg/"">well</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16108-throbbing-gristle/"">documented</a> and doesn't need repeating here. This is about an end, not a beginning. Just as the origins of TG make for fascinating reading, so too do the final days of the band. This release, containing a full album cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3039-nico/"">Nico</a>'s 1970 record, <i>Desertshore</i>, plus an album of new material titled <i>The Final Report</i>, doesn't bear the Throbbing Gristle name. It revolves around original members Peter ""Sleazy"" Christopherson, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29990-chris-carter/"">Chris Carter</a>, and Cosey Fanni Tutti, who performed as X-TG after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19937-genesis-p-orridge/"">Genesis P-Orridge</a> suddenly quit Throbbing Gristle during a seemingly-fruitful reunion. X-TG's shelf-life was short-- Sleazy passed away in November 2010 after the trio played just two shows under the name.</p>
<p>P-Orridge's departure is still causing acrimony between the band members, including a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47992-genesis-p-orridge-and-chris-carter-in-twitter-feud-over-upcoming-throbbing-gristle-album/"">Twitter spat</a> between h/er and Carter. Five years ago, when things were more harmonious, the group staged an ambitious summer residency at the ICA in London comprised of six two-hour sessions based around<i> Desertshore</i>, the results of which were to be used on their interpretation of Nico's record. P-Orridge provided vocals on the songs, and the raw materials were even released as a <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Throbbing-Gristle-Desertshore-Installation/release/1009855"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">12-disc CD-R set</a>. The idea of covering the Nico album belonged to Sleazy, who passed away shortly after P-Orridge left the band in 2010. It's hard to imagine the conflicting emotions Carter and Tutti must have gone through when finalizing this project, although the fact that it's born out of chaos and animosity feels fitting. But this is no last snarl of anger. It's a relatively sedate affair compared to the broader body of TG work, a contemplative pair of albums that feel like an extended goodbye note, executed with the kind of careful thought required when handling precious materials left behind by a friend.</p>
<p>The problem of how to fill the P-Orridge void on <i>Desertshore</i> was solved by bringing in a series of guest vocalists, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/233-antony-and-the-johnsons/"">Antony Hegarty</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/61-marc-almond/"">Marc Almond</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1306-einsturzende-neubauten/"">Blixa Bargeld</a>. Wildcard contributions come from porn star turned musician/actress Sasha Grey and filmmaker Gaspar Noé, with Tutti filling out the vocal duties on two tracks. The idea of using guest vocalists originated with Sleazy, whose typically obtuse selection of singers included singer-songwriter Jake Thackray and famed children's TV animator Oliver Postgate. Here, we get a series of artists sticking firmly to their strengths. Bargeld gets closest to the spirit of Nico, curling a nicotine-stained vocal around ""Mutterlein"" that transforms it from muted drama into a whirl of waltz-time color. The overall tone for the piece is set by Antony, who casts an astonishing sweep of vocal darkness over ""Janitor of Lunacy"", all set to reverent electronics and horns that snake up in the mix toward the song's close. Antony, like the rest of the cast, wisely chooses not to stick too close to the source material.</p>
<p>There's little in <i>Desertshore</i> that sounds like TG or Sleazy's work in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/967-coil/"">Coil</a>. Instead this is a one-off strain of inspiration, similar to the excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30263-carter-tutti-void/"">Carter Tutti Void</a> project. Sometimes it dips into torch song territory, such as on Almond's stirring take on ""The Falconer"". At other times there's light pouring in, with Tutti's two vocal turns alternating between strident (""All That Is My Own"") and pillowy (""My Only Child""). Carefully tweaked beats and electronics run throughout, providing the album with a crisp aesthetic bedrock. Occasional growls of analog synth feel like a sharp reminder this is three members of TG thrashing around on a short leash. But fundamentally there's a feeling of respect, a sense of bringing to life a vision from someone who couldn't be around to complete it. Diehard fans may not be looking for that kind of sentiment from a band that staked its reputation on anything <i>but</i> respect, but looping <i>Desertshore</i> back to the noisier side of the group would have been a shift into a redundant cul-de-sac. What binds the work of Sleazy, Carter, and Tutti, plus many of the guest vocalists, is a sense of forward momentum, of leaving the past behind.</p>
<p><i>The Final Report</i> is a less essential document, consisting of a series of tracks the three members worked on prior to Sleazy's death. There's incredible depth and detail to the arrangements, with deathly chills pumped through the sparse material (""Breach"") and a choking sense of claustrophobia packed into more layered work (""Stasis""). Nothing feels quite complete, and perhaps that's the point. ""Um Dum Dom"" drifts into a fog of spooky ambience and just stays there, its low vocal moans effectively ripping tiny holes in the surface at all the right spots. At times it feels like there's something missing, and it's certainly tempting to wonder how <i>The Final Report</i> would feel with P-Orridge's involvement. It's when they move out of the somber mood pieces that <i>The Final Report</i> gains an unusual shape of its own. ""In Accord"" is full of peculiarly contorted electronics that feel like they're deteriorating at the hands of the players in real time. Even better is ""Gordian Knot"", a track full of vocal manipulations that positively glower.</p>
<p>Where <i>Desertshore</i> and <i>The Final Report</i> connect is through a fascination with reaching the point where beauty gets tangled up with ugliness. It's something that ran through Nico's career from start to finish, where fashion model looks slowly sagged into heroin addiction, where a rare kind of musical talent faded pitifully into the shadows. By tapping into that feeling Sleazy was unwittingly creating what would be a poignant final chapter to his own career, a slightly madcap idea that gathers more emotional gravitas than he ever intended. We shouldn't search too hard for meaning in his choice of final statement; this is someone who could flit between directing Van Halen videos and making records as affecting as Coil's <i>Musick to Play in the Dark</i> albums. But Carter/Tutti have done great justice to his idea here, rounding off the concept by filling this album with a sense of loss that sinks into its core. In the documentary <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113973/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Nico Icon</i></a>, Nico's aunt described her as ""dreaming and boundless, seeing something that wasn't really there."" <i>Desertshore</i> effortlessly taps into that feeling.</p></div>"|17376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17376-desertshore/|7.8|Nick Neyland

(See ""Pop That"", <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/magazine/lady-mondegreen-and-the-miracle-of-misheard-song-lyrics.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the etymology of ""fanute,""</a> ""Stay Schemin'"", <a href=""http://www.gq.com/style/blogs/the-gq-eye/2012/07/what-if-french-montana-was-a-stylists.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sharing his ""Versace silk swag"" with the offices of <i>GQ</i></a>.) But I still have no idea what a great French Montana song sounds like. Don't get me wrong, I'm responsible for more than a few of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98HX5nbsCI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">25 million YouTube views</a> granted to ""Pop That"". But much like his mentor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29628-max-b/"" target=""_blank"">Max B</a>, French Montana's qualities as a rapper-- a marble-mouthed, sing-song flow that toggles between clear-eyed observation and heavy-lidded confession-- hardly translate on paper or in a boardroom. At this point he has more record deals than actual records, so the question remains: ""What do you do with this guy?"" <i>Mac &amp; Cheese 3 </i>is French Montana's most high-profile mixtape to date and proof that no one else really seems to know the answer.</p>
<p>Or, that the answer is ""everything."" The roster of <i>Mac &amp; Cheese 3 </i>is astounding on multiple levels, the first of which is that it would be utterly absurd even on a record that needed to justify the $9.99 expenditure. It might be the most heavily A&amp;R'ed mixtape ever made. There really is no precedent for this mumble-goes-mainstream sort of blockbuster, at least not until the Duplass brothers get to direct the next <i>Die Hard </i>movie or something. What really stands out above all is how it assumes that French Montana is either the most malleable rapper alive or that he simply does not matter.</p>
<p>Witness him trading bars with past-their-prime NYC rappers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7246-fat-joe/"" target=""_blank"">Fat Joe</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30073-prodigy/"" target=""_blank"">Prodigy</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7480-fabolous/"" target=""_blank"">Fabolous</a>, who says ""teach me how to Douglas"" on ""Dance Move"", an event that should not go undocumented. Or, maybe he's more of a XXL Freshman 10 type, so here's some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30111-mac-miller/"" target=""_blank"">Mac Miller</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29472-tyga/"" target=""_blank"">Tyga</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10147-wale/"" target=""_blank"">Wale</a> features! Or, hey, we're getting the Bad Boy band back together! Not quite, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7422-diddy/"" target=""_blank"">Diddy</a> and Ma$e show up separately and the latter appears promising to bring you ""soup and orange juice if you’re really sick"" on a track that borders on condoning sexual assault (""Grownups""). Another event that should not go undocumented. Or maybe French is a Slip-N-Slide rapper! <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a> would've shown up regardless, but Trina ends up stealing the show on ""Tic Toc"", partly because she contributes an awesome verse, partly because she adds contrast to a mixtape whose depressing sexual politics suggests that ""Pop That""'s views on women were its biggest selling point.</p>
<p>""Ocho Cinco"" sets the tone in terms of its features and its deadening misogyny. The second track on <i>Mac &amp; Cheese 3</i> features the following: perpetually ignored NYC mixtape space-filler Red Café, Everlast/Yelawolf hybrid MGK, Chief Keef producer Young Chop, and Diddy, who has apparently signed several of these guys. What exactly could unify this crew? Here's the group chant of a hook: ""Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco!"" I mean, I've heard worse and having seen just enough <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/chad-ochocinco-johnson-wife-evelyn-lozada-interview-head-butt-arrested-charge-17141399"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SportsCenter and <i>Real Housewives of Atlanta,</i></a> I get the joke. It's still a joke that uses an episode of domestic violence as a means of demanding oral sex. ""Ocho Cinco"" is then followed by a skit which is 30 seconds of minor variations on threats to ""beat my baby moms up"" for listening to a French Montana tape. Needless to say, it's played for laughs.</p>
<p>Weirdly, through all of this, French remains kinda likeable if not remotely admirable. For all of its repulsiveness, ""Pop That"" felt more like the talk of a high school locker room than a conversation between high rollers in bottle service and, at its best, <i>Mac &amp; Cheese 3 </i>retains that giddy vulgarity. Though he's obviously a spiritual descendent of Max B, I tend to hear Gucci Mane in how his slack delivery can obscure his clever wordplay or Noreaga in that his generally knucklehead demeanor can make the occasional but very real instances of resonance feel like they've been created against their own will.</p>
<p>And you have to at least appreciate the wealth of production here. Harry Fraud gave French his first solo hit (""Shot Caller"") and is something of a kindred spirit in that he's a similarly hot name without an identifiable ""trick."" On <i>Mac &amp; Cheese 3</i>, his uptempo, soul-infused beats prove to be complementary, utilizing recognizable samples ranging from Florence &amp; the Machine (""Intro"") to the original source material of Jay-Z's ""D'evils"" (""State of Mind"") and Ice Cube's ""Today Was a Good Day"" (""Triple Double""). But once again, overzealous matchmaking sinks <i>Mac &amp; Cheese; </i>access to a couple of Young Chop beats would be an unquestionable coup for French Montana if he actually sounded at home on them. As is, it's strange to hear a grown man following what were likely instructions to sound as much like Chief Keef as possible, and the only real difference between ""Love Sosa"" and ""Devil Want My Soul"" is that the latter is a minute and a half longer.</p>
<p>And trust, <i>Mac &amp; Cheese 3 </i>did not need any sort of extra padding. If its fantasy football approach to team building is a remnant of the cash-flush late 90s, its CD-maxing length is as well, yet <i>Mac &amp; Cheese 3 </i>never settles into a groove. French Montana simply blends in and is only as entertaining as his surroundings. When J. Cole turns up with a surprisingly slick verse and Rick Ross demands that his kids see him buried like a pharaoh, ""Diamonds"" makes the ridiculous enterprise seem worthwhile. When immeasurably duller guys like Ace Hood and Chinx Drugs and Mac Miller show up, <i>Mac &amp; Cheese 3 </i>feels like it might never end. Even after spending more than an hour with a French Montana mixtape, you get no closer to figuring out what to do with him. It's appropriate he's so closely associated with a made up word-- like ""fanute"" French remains ill-defined, and you sorta just know when it's being used correctly.</p></div>"|17466.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17466-mac-cheese-3/|5.4|Ian Cohen

In their formal inventiveness, love of blank space, and haiku-like neatness, they arouse the part of your brain that suspects it's being outsmarted. Even if you're rarely shaken listening to Muhly, you're usually intrigued: To feel your intellect being playfully, patiently tested, as if he is circling your mind and kicking its tires, can be a wonderfully maddening experience.</p>
<p>His <i>Drones</i>, initially spread across three EPs and collected here as a full-length, toys with the notion of drone in a way that fits Muhly's ""cat meets yarn ball"" sensibility. Writing about the pieces for his blog, Muhly mentions ""singing along with one's vacuum cleaner, or…the subtle but constant humming found in most dwelling-places"" and writes, ""We surround ourselves with constant noise, and the <i>Drones</i> pieces are an attempt to honor these drones and stylize them."" He expanded on this idea in a July blog post: ""The process of idling at the airport, taxiing, and taking off (to say nothing of the flight itself) is a series of changing drones. Idling, for instance, is a constant c#, with an ever-changing top note: f#, e#, or e.""</p>
<p>Like many of Muhly's compositional ideas, this one suggests a quizzical interest in music that lives in our most arid cultural spaces; his 2008 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12070-mothertongue/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mothertongue</i></a><span> began with a recitation of all the street addresses he has called home. Muhly seems at home in this world, and part of the enjoyment of <i>Drones</i> is in how it seems to observe, from Muhly’s serene remove, how others are not. <i>Drones &amp; Piano</i> sets a hard-charging staccato piano line against a soft unchanging hum of piano and violin, evoking someone pacing in an airless space -- the aisles of the taxiing plane, maybe, that Muhly is busy analyzing chordal structures on.</span></p>
<p><i>Drones &amp; Viola</i> and <i>Drones &amp; Violin</i> are slight modifications of this scenario; the three pieces seem to sit inside of each other like Chinese boxes. The lulling, fluttering drones, played on piano and violin, smooth over the outbursts of the solo instruments the way a humming dryer might quiet a colicky baby. There are moments of fierce urgency, like the one in ""Part II: Material in a Handsome Stack"" where Nadia Sirota's sinewy viola rises and lets out a feral cry. You can feel the bow hairs gripping and pulling the strings out of place, but the moment's drama dissolves back into the soft thrum. Even Bruce Brubaker's seething, pacing piano line on <i>Drones &amp; Piano</i> seems to have settled back grumbling into its seat for takeoff by the end. Mundanity has a muffling effect.</p>
<p>What Muhly might think of this situation isn't clear, exactly. Are we being smothered and sedated by all this ambient noise? Does it isolate us from our deeper feelings the way thick plate glass separates prisoners from their visitors? His pieces never step in to comment, and Muhly's not the type to insert himself. He is an observer, humming his observations to himself beneath the constantly changing root note of his vacuum cleaner, and maybe he's suggesting we do the same. We're not getting rid of all this extraneous noise, so we might as well sing along to it.</p></div>"|17448.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17448-drones/|7.1|Jayson Greene

But something remarkable happens at the beginning of Nadja's new album, and that is: nothing at all. In place of the impenetrable wall of noise that usually greets you on their many recordings, there's just the quiet murmur of Leah Buckareff's bass, the tick-tock tap of a cymbal, and a complete absence of Aidan Baker's effects-pedal onslaught-- by Nadja standards, this is the equivalent of cutting an Unplugged session.</p>
<p>Of course, this sense of serenity lasts for just 60 seconds, upon which that barren bassline is amplified into the tsunami-sized sludge of ""One Sense Alone"". But by offering that tentative tease, and unleasing the noise in more controlled spurts, Nadja offer a glimpse of something not always discernible on their previous records: their immense sense of scale. Nadja's capacity for heaviness has never been in doubt, but <i>Dagdrøm</i> lets you really feel the weight of it all. And it's a heft measured not just by volume, but by how long it takes to dissipate, each shock of distortion lingering like the tingles in a sleeping foot being shaken awake.</p>
<p>The greater definition heard on <i>Dagdrøm</i> is a logical extension of Nadja's 2009 covers album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13026-when-i-see-the-sun-always-shines-on-tv/"" target=""_blank""><i>When I See the Sun Always Shines on TV</i></a>, though the dread-ridden vibe in effect here is informed much more by their stalking take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer/"" target=""_blank"">Slayer</a>'s ""Dead Skin Mask"" than their hazy-heady drift through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Elliott Smith</a>'s ""Needle in the Hay"". And for that you can thank the recruitment of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"" target=""_blank"">the Jesus Lizard</a>'s Mac McNeilly, the kind of drummer you'd be foolish to bury under too much dreamy drone. McNeilly (who also appeared on the intensely prolific Baker's recent solo double album, <i>The Spectrum of Distraction</i>) doesn't try to destablize Nadja's signature slow-motion sway; in Lizardian terms, his default mode here is more ""Monkey Trick"" than ""Boilermaker"". But McNeilly's martial, militaristic hits lend Nadja a noticeably more threatening momentum. And they provide a predatory percussive complement to Baker's mostly obscured delivery, which here sounds less informed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a>'s vaporous vocals than the ominous mutterings of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"" target=""_blank"">Slint</a>'s Brian McMahan. If <a href=""http://www.touchandgorecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Touch &amp; Go Records</a> had gotten in on the doom-metal game back in 1991, it would've sounded a lot like this.</p>
<p><i>Dagdrøm</i> contains four tracks that average 11 minutes each, and though they're presented as discrete pieces, each is similar in mood and execution, and each plays off the one before it as a variation on the same foreboding theme.<i> </i>""Falling Out of Your Head"" effectively chops the riff of ""One Sense Alone"" in half and doubles the tension, leading a <i>Spiderland</i>-stark lurch to an accelerated, increasingly punishing climax; the title track immediately resumes the in-the-red onslaught, but gradually winds down, reducing its once-imposing refrain to expose the tranquil melody underpinning it. It's followed by the closing ""Space Time &amp; Absence"", a song that likewise showcases Nadja's sonic extremities, but on an evermore epic scale: McNeilly's galloping, tribal beat propels the song into a gargantuan groove, before yielding to a hushed, drawn-out comedown that keeps threatening to erupt once again, like a horror-movie villain that just won't stay dead. And therein lies the key to <i>Dagdrøm</i>'s daunting mystique: You're never really sure if what you're hearing is the calm before the storm or the storm before the calm.</p></div>"|17317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17317-dagdrm/|7.8|Stuart Berman

The music had started out as another step in a continuum leading from Jamaican reggae through British techno; the most mainstream versions of it now function more or less like arena rock, with hot guitar solos replaced by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTS6CKuZ4kg&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""heavy, dirty, filthy""</a> bass drops. This isn't a eulogy for what dubstep was or a criticism of what it became, just a statement of fact: times change, things trend, and what was once essentially just a genre of underground dance music having awkward brushes with popular culture is now a brightly colored <a href=""http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/WhatsNew/Sex+Drugs+amp+Dubstep+Tank+Top-949833.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hot Topic t-shirt</a> declaring, finally, SEX, DRUGS &amp; DUBSTEP. </p>
<p>The role labels like Hemlock played in this transformation is pretty negligible. Even before dubstep's more widescale commercialization, they represented a boutique alternative whose releases were more diverse and usually less immediate than more iconically dubstep artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14226-digital-mystikz/"" target=""_blank"">Digital Mystikz</a>, folding in house, electro, minimal and other sounds from outside the sphere. </p>
<p>The label's cofounder, Jack Dunning-- who records as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27930-untold/"" target=""_blank"">Untold</a>-- makes violent, corrosive little sound sculptures that resemble people trying desperately to catch their breath or the clang-on-clang of demolition sites. In a quote that stands as one of my favorite statements of artistic purpose, he once <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1105"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> Resident Advisor that, ""I want to make people screwface, shout, dance weird."" Hemlock put out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a>'s phenomenally great <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11608-air-lack-thereof/"" target=""_blank"">first single</a> and remix, which sound like gospel if gospel were designed to terrify you instead of make you feel safe; they've also put out singles by magpies like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28982-ramadanman/"" target=""_blank"">Ramadanman</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29715-fantastic-mr-fox/"" target=""_blank"">Fantastic Mr. Fox</a>. </p>
<p><span>Presented as an hour-long Untold mix with a few new, unmixed extras tacked on, <i>Hemlock Recordings Chapter One</i> tries to tell a story of the label as it stands now. Almost 20 minutes of the mix is new material, including the tacked-on songs. ""</span>The tracks I play these days are basically house or electro, but made by producers who came through dubstep,"" Dunning said in <a href=""http://www.junodownload.com/plus/2011/02/21/interview-untold/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview</a> last year. ""People are writing stuff that sounds like minimal techno, grime, juke etc, but it has a twist, an edge that carries through some of the trademarks of the original dubstep sound-- sub bass, darkness, space and unpredictability.""</p>
<p>As evidence of his own argument, Dunning's mix moves in roughly chronological order, from the label's stuttering, lopsided first singles to its firm, house-influenced recent output. The change isn't just rhythmic, either: Hemlock's early tracks sounded hard, flat and airless, like the music had been vacuum-packed, while a lot of the mid-mix material-- especially Guy Andrew's ""Resistivity"" and Sei A's ""Hyphen""-- sounds like its playing from inside a fog bank. (For a visual metaphor, try a <a href=""http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/mondrian/broadway.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Piet Mondrian</a> next to a <a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4ozn17Gu7sM/TRiJYW3ow0I/AAAAAAAAAWU/fkOPgpf6xKk/s1600/20090323_cohen_coll_richter.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gerhardt Richter</a>.)</p>
<p><span>For a celebration of the past, it's a progressive and unsentimental attitude to take, but Dunning has always seemed like an admirably progressive and unsentimental artist-- he knows that all these familiar oldies were once new, too. But the format has its drawbacks. S</span><span>ome of the best older tracks have clever, winding structures that make them more interesting as start-to-finish pieces of music than raw materials to chop up and use in a mix. There's also something a little inbred about hearing an hour of tracks coming from the same place, even when a third of them are new. </span>More than anything, the mix just seems like a formality-- the thing that techno labels do because other techno labels do it.</p>
<p>What it reveals about Hemlock is, again, what Dunning wants it to reveal: They never had a single exclusive sound to begin with. The affiliations between the artists here have less to do with dubstep and more to do with a misfit love of nasty sounds probably best exemplified by Dunning himself. He has said that his own pseudo-scientifically titled <i>Change in a Dynamic Environment</i> EPs from this year were attempts to use dance music's tendency toward short releases to capture small shifts in personal style, as well as evidence of his almost compulsive predisposition toward the new.</p>
<p>There's something sentimental about a commemorative release for a label that has only been around for four years. At least with Dunning you can take comfort in the knowledge that if they ever do this again, the sound will have changed just as much, if not more.</p></div>"|17302.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17302-hemlock-recordings-chapter-one/|7.0|Mike Powell

It was the summer of 1991 in Washington, D.C., and the four members of the Olympia-based punk band were in a professional recording studio for the first time. The EP's de facto producer, straight edge monastic and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2891-minor-threat/"" target=""_blank"">Minor Threat</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a> frontman Ian MacKaye, recalls in its liner notes when one member glanced at the mixing board and marveled, ""It's like <i>Star Trek</i>!"" In the middle of a tour riddled with heckling and violent threats, Bikini Kill were nervous, road-wearied and vulnerable, all of which comes through on the EP. ""It [was] a way to demystify the myth of perfection that a more polished product perpetuates,"" drummer Tobi Vail <a href=""http://www.emusic.com/listen/#/music-news/spotlight/perfecting-imperf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> earlier this year, reflecting on the EP's aesthetic, ""It's also a way to say, 'Hey! You at home! You can make a record too!'"" <i>Bikini Kill </i>is purposefully, defiantly, invitingly imperfect. This is why some people thought it was the scourge of the underground (""It was sad to see a woman so desperately confused,"" one music critic wrote of Hanna at the time); it's also why some other people have its lyrics tattooed on their skin. And it's precisely why, two decades later, it still sounds like a revolution.</p>
<p>In 2012, Bikini Kill's legend is more widely known than their music. The spirit of riot grrrl is manifesting not so much in bands but in extra-musical phenomena influenced by the movement's ideas: from the rebel girls running the feminist teen webzine <a href=""http://rookiemag.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rookie</a> to the collective of Russian revolutionaries who plucked two pieces of the Bikini Kill lexicon and dubbed themselves <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30623-pussy-riot/"" target=""_blank"">Pussy Riot</a>. So the release of the first EP on Bikini Kill Records (an imprint formed to reissue the band's discography) feels like an auspiciously timed opportunity to remember something that's come to feel, oddly, almost secondary to their story: Bikini Kill wrote great punk songs. Tobi Vail's drumming managed to sound both wildly anarchic and assertively tight; Kathi Wilcox's bass gave even their hardest songs an elastic, low-end pogo-ability. Billy Karren pivoted between sludge-coated surf riffs and piercing dissonance. And then there was Hanna, sassing, seething, and spitting the band's cumulative passion like hot bile.</p>
<p>Commemorative reissues of classic punk records present certain ideological challenges. Should a band that sticks a $200+ price tag on a box set of previously released material be banned from speaking about the evils of capitalism? Can liner notes explain why a certain album is great without discouraging the listener from coming to his or her own conclusions? Is it possible to glorify the past without shortchanging the future? Well, aging punks, take note: the reissue of <i>Bikini Kill</i> elegantly avoids these pitfalls. It provides context (a zine-style insert featuring photos, collages, and recent interviews with MacKaye and Bratmobile's Molly Neuman) but doesn't stifle you with nostalgia. It pokes fun at the scenester's eternal refrain of ""I was there"" (one interview's gently mocking subtitle: ""Bikini Kill, You Really Had To Be There…""), and it's ticketed at the reasonable price of just 2 and 2/5 Fugazi shows (not adjusted for inflation). It's an uncommonly inviting reissue, letting the songs sound not like museum pieces but living documents. Somehow, this music still sounds throbbingly present tense, which levels the exclusiveness of nostalgia.</p>
<p><i>Bikini Kill </i>touches on themes they'd continue to explore over the next half-decade. ""Liar"" draws a direct line between capitalism and forms of social oppression (""You profit from the lie""), ""Carnival"" extols the virtues and radical possibilities of seemingly trashy pleasures (""It's by the Lacey Mall! That's where you'll find me, yeah!""), and the opening manifesto ""Double Dare Ya"" manages to cram everything Bikini Kill stood for into two minutes and 41 gloriously abrasive seconds. ""Hey girlfriennnnnnd,"" Hanna begins, ""I gotta proposition, goes something like this! Dare you to do what you want! Dare you to be who you will! Dare you to cry right out loud!"" It's one of their definitive songs: an explosive collision between didacticism and dynamism, a Bill of Rights you can mosh to.</p>
<p>And as Hanna treats each song like a cross between a political speech and a vaudeville act, her performance on this EP is nothing short of legendary. She can roar as powerfully as she can belt and over the course of the EP she adopts a wide range of personas: She's Barbie, she's Biafra, she's a drill sergeant and a (not-so) conscientious objector, she's artist and (on the incendiary and dryly funny ""Thurston Hearts the Who"") critic, victim and abuser; she's your dad, your mom, your little brother, and your big sister all trapped (or liberated) inside one body.</p>
<p>The elasticity of voice in a Bikini Kill song is visceral, cathartic, and occasionally even comic. But it's also inherently political. Shortly before forming Bikini Kill, Hanna was working at a domestic violence shelter where she'd founded a discussion group for teen girls. This experience had a huge impact on her songwriting. In Sara Marcus's riot grrrl history <i>Girls to the Front</i>, she says that these were the girls she was initially writing for, screaming out other women's pent-up silence. So the vocal theatrics Hanna delivers on the earliest Bikini Kill songs are sometimes declarations of resistance (during the chorus of the blistering ""Suck My Left One"", she voices a girl hurling the title phrase at her sexually abusive father like she's re-enacting a scene from <i>The </i><i>Exorcist</i>), but they also find her exercising her freedom, acting on the challenge she issues in the first song: <i>Dare you to be who you will!</i></p>
<p>""Women make natural anarchists and revolutionaries because they've always been second-class citizens, having to claw their way out,"" Kim Gordon said in a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47664-pussy-riot-appeal-conviction/"">interview</a>. She was reflecting on the trial of Pussy Riot, who cite Bikini Kill as a major influence, but she might as well have been summing up the spirit of Bikini Kill's earliest recordings. They'd go on to make better records (<i>The Singles</i> remains Bikini Kill's defining document), but none invite the listener to re-think how records are measured quite like their insurrectionary first EP. So if Pussy Riot prove the continued relevance of Bikini Kill's ideology, this EP does the same for something that deserves just as much credit: their music. In its grooves, still, you hear the revolution.</p></div>"|17434.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17434-bikini-kill-ep/|8.7|Lindsay Zoladz

On the three-hour van ride there, I struggled mightily against my own unreasonable expectations. I had missed my chance by about 20 years to witness the Bad Brains of my imagination-- the ones you see immortalized in <a href=""http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/dotlinecircle/imgs/a/4/a49e1846.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this iconic Glen Friedman photo</a>, for instance-- perform live. Those guys no longer existed, and hadn't since the second Reagan administration. I was late by two decades. This was probably going to go poorly.</p>
<p>It did so, more than I could ever have imagined. Lead singer H.R. wandered onstage several uncomfortable minutes after his bandmates had taken their place. He conducted the band with limp hands in a way that seemed to be directly mocking them. He stopped frequently to look up at the venue's squat ceiling to seemingly address Jah. Bassist Darryl Jenifer fixed a thousand-yard stare to the back of the venue and played dutifully. The only member who seemed to enjoying himself was guitarist Dr. Know, who shredded joyfully through the solos in ""Let Me Help"" and ""Re-Ignition"". The set leaned heavily on the bleary reggae that absolutely no one in the audience had come to hear and after perfunctory run-throughs of two or three hardcore classics, H.R. thanked Jah, thanked us, and they left. Filing out crestfallen, I caught the eye of another foolishly hopeful kid visibly doing battle with disappointment. ""They didn't even play <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3VkSyBF01w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">'F.V.K.'</a>,"" he said plaintively.</p>
<p>This is the unique curse that sometimes visits legendary bands who have the audacity to stay together, or even worse, <i>keep recording</i>, once their legend has crystallized. Bad Brains’ thunderclap fusion of hardcore, metal, and reggae into a single righteous roar is still probably the greatest thing to happen to hardcore punk, and their 1982 self-titled ROIR record remains, in <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/bad-brains-to-honor-adam-yauch-new-album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the words</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6534-adam-yauch/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Yauch</a>, ""the best punk/hardcore album of all time."" What happened after that-- the downshift into metallized reggae for 1986's <i>I Against I</i>, their brief major-label dalliance in the 90s, reggae albums, name changes, and more-- can only feel like denouement. The mere fact of their survival into a third decade is surprising; the band I saw in 2000 seemed minutes away from gratefully quitting each other's company forever. But the band stubbornly persists.</p>
<p><i>Into The Future</i> is their seventh label-sanctioned studio album, depending on how you count their early breadcrumb trail of fabled pre-1983 releases, but they've passed through so many iterations in the intervening years that the through line is hard to trace. Their last studio album, 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10376-build-a-nation/"" target=""_blank""><i>Build A Nation</i></a>, was produced by Yauch, whose above-mentioned sticker quote probably did more to disseminate the band's music than any label (it was certainly the reason I bought it at age 14). On that album, they attempted to reignite the fury of their ""Banned in D.C."" days, but the lurching, muddy, tuneless results testified to the same tug of war that was painfully obvious onstage: the band eager to re-ignite, H.R. content to warble Rasta homilies and indulge in his most eccentric vocal tendencies. <i></i></p>
<p><i>Into The Future</i> finds the band louder, darker, and more unpredictable than they have sounded in awhile: Their metal riffs have notes shaved off their phrases, which lends the music a drunken gait. H.R.'s vocals have veered into such idiosyncratic territory that he now belongs to a select group of all-mannerisms vocalists: late Tom Waits, Mike Patton, late Gil Scott Heron. He yelps and gibbers and whines and does that startling valkyrie shriek he unleashed on ""Supertouch"" and ""Return to Heaven"". On ""Popcorn"" he does a routine that feels far too close to Anthony Kiedis circa ""Funky Monks"". He bursts out out into his wild scatting on ""We Belong Together"". <i>Into the Future</i> is the most interesting Bad Brains reunion album in part because it allows H.R. to be as weird as he likes.<br/><br/>The band has also found a way to sneak the sweetness of melody back into their music, always an unremarked-upon secret weapon in their best work. ""Into The Future,"" ""We Belong Together"", and ""Fun"" are more memorable songs than anything on <i>Build a Nation</i>. ""We Belong Together"" is probably the best full-throttle punk-metal song they've written since ""Soul Craft"". They seem to be enjoying each other, and their music, for the first time in years. Their reggae detours don't have the advantage of surprise anymore, but they are nice reminders of the band’s formidable chops and range.</p>
<p>H.R.'s lyrics have never been celebrated for their coherence or profundity, and the chorus of ""Fun"" (""Let's have fun/ We all need fun/ Music is fun/ School is fun/ Love is fun"") is a moment you wish he hadn't sung straight. But it's rewarding, or at least a relief, for longtime fans to hear H.R. and his band locking into a shared groove. Sloppiness has crept into their once-perfect attack, and there is a certain any-era-of-modern-rock, unstuck-in-time vibe to the production choices and songwriting. But such is the plight of a band whose 30-year-old debut still feels like future music.<b><br/></b></p></div>"|17329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17329-into-the-future/|5.9|Jayson Greene

Like most of the album, both sounded like hit rap songs beamed in from a few years into the future, but recently when the two have worked together they've gotten even further out, like the beat for ""Fuckin the DJ"" that they made for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30309-mykki-blanco"" target=""_blank"">Mykki Blanco</a>, which alternates between near-ambient verses and an almost violently psychedelic chorus.</span></p>
<p><span>The four original compositions on </span><i>Liquid</i><span> (five on the vinyl version) stick more to the former mood. The instrumental opening track, ""Jelly Fish"", uses a splashing sound, possibly synthetic, as one of its primary rhythmic elements, alongside some Kanye-ish hand drum samples. A reverb-laden synth provides what little melody there is in the song, a tone-bending run up and down a scale that could be the hook from a lost rave anthem, or maybe lifted from a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2384-konono-n1/"" target=""_blank"">Konono N°1</a> song. Otherwise the spaces where lead instruments are found in typical songs are taken up by electronic clicks and gurgles, washes of white noise, and delay effects feeding back on themselves. Taken as a whole, it sounds like a chill-out room curated by seapunks.</span></p>
<p><span>With its hypnotic polyrhythmic beat and metallic clangs, the second cut, ""Buoy"", comes off slightly harder by comparison, but it's still a very spacey track-- every time the mood starts getting too elevated most of the instruments drop out and the whole thing drifts for a few seconds on its own echoes before the beat kicks in again. Two-thirds of the way through what sounds like a chattering synthesizer shows up, and slowly reveals itself to be Le1f rapping through a vocoder, his voice so heavily altered that you can't make out the lyrics. It's only in the song’s last minute that <i>Liquid</i> finally delivers an actual understandable vocal part, which happens to be nautically themed.</span></p>
<p><span>After the ambient diptych of ""Jelly Fish"" and ""Buoy"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14588-soda/"" target=""_blank"">""Soda""</a>, sounds like a straight up pop rap song, if only by virtue of having a steady beat and vocals throughout. In fact, the beat relies heavily on actual literal popping sounds arranged in cascades that are presented with little embellishment other than Le1f's rap, which has a repetitive quality that wedges it firmly into the brain. It's easy to imagine Nicki Minaj listening to it and taking notes for her next record. (The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48648-le1f-releases-liquid-ep-with-boody-shares-literal-new-video-for-soda/http://youtu.be/6herO1dIc4s"" target=""_blank"">video</a>, centered around vogue-ing and soda-pop bukkake, has already started to give ""Wut"" a run for its viral money.)</span></p>
<p><span><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/le1f/sweet-tea-produced-by-boody-b"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sweet Tea""</a> has been on <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/le1f"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Le1f's SoundCloud</a> since before </span><i>Dark York</i><span>, and it sounds very much like original-flavor Le1f. That’s a good flavor, and it's a catchy song, but after the first three cuts it feels tame. Between it and the two remixes (Cedaa's version of ""Sweet Tea"" and MikeQ and Divoli S'vere's clubby take on ""Soda"") that follow, the EP's ending feels like a glance over the shoulder at what Le1f's accomplished so far. He deserves it, but what you walk away from during <i>Liquid</i>'s stronger moments is the idea that, right now, the best direction for him to be facing is forward.</span></p></div>"|17454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17454-liquid-ep/|7.1|Miles Raymer

The annual competition, which allows for individual and group bouts, pits turntablists against each other to perform highly insular, complicated sets, which are then scored by judges. There are some famous alumni, including the late Roc Raida of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4677-x-ecutioners/"" target=""_blank"">X-Ecutioners</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5254-a-trak/"" target=""_blank"">A-Trak</a>. But former champions are more likely to resemble Harvard math BS and Tisch School of the Arts Professor, DJ Shiftee, whose technical acuity is leagues ahead of his glamour quotient.</p>
<p>DJ Final, aka Magnus August Høiberg, aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30860-cashmere-cat/"" target=""_blank"">Cashmere Cat</a>, was a DMC finalist, which should give you some impression of his abilities behind the boards. But in early February 2011, the Norwegian producer left that insular and somewhat stuffy world behind for a new persona: that of a ""forest cat"" who loved to make music. There was a picture of the supposed artist near the bottom of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cashmere-Cat/114072805335396"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his Facebook page</a>, stretched out on a car seat and all tangled up with a USB cord and an Apple charger. The caption on the photo is ""me workin on a new song in the studio."" A little closer to the bottom of the page there's a video of some kittens running back and forth across a turntable. The note here reads ""me worKinG on sOME newWW tRaxX wiTHh soME FrIenDZ.""</p>
<p>It's this combination-- a hugely efficient technical sensibility superseded by a pop playfulness that makes Cashmere Cat such an effective producer. His debut EP <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/cashmerecat/sets/mirrormaruep/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Mirror Maru</i></a> is comprised of four tracks of colorful, warm EDM suffused with R&amp;B leanings and backed by regimented drum samples. And though it's only 15 minutes long, the EP manages to communicate a fully realized artistic persona, one that finds the beating heart underneath all that scratched vinyl.</p>
<p>Where producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30667-ryan-hemsworth/"" target=""_blank"">Ryan Hemsworth</a> (whom Høiberg is reminiscent of) go in for Trap and classic Southern rap to give their music its punch, the Oslo native takes his cues from producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"" target=""_blank"">Timbaland</a>, employing all manner of drum machines and unorthodox sound effects (autotuned bedsprings anyone?) to create a backdrop for melody. On the title track, a stately descending piano guides us in and out, while interspersed drumstick interludes pick us up and drop us deeper into the mix. Near the one minute mark, shimmering percussion and a slapping drum machine highlight the tones above them, acting as a compass to illuminate the direction in which the track is heading.</p>
<p>These signposts are necessary as Høiberg puts an emphasis on forward progression that makes his tracks feel looser than your standard build-tension-drop-bass one-two step. Without the percussion it would be easy to get mired in temperate noise. ""Secrets + Lies"" doesn't rely on any kind of simple loop or repetition, and instead builds slowly, arching its way into a beautiful vocal sample and refusing altogether to indulge listeners by pulling bass out of the mix. Even at the two minute mark, the producer's able to keep things fresh, accentuating a tiny drop with a musicality that makes it clear he's unwilling to rely on simple tricks.</p>
<p>But Høiberg isn't all holier-than-thou restraint and undeniable smoothness. The Cashmere Cat moniker first caught attention by remixing Lana Del Ray, Drake, and Jeremih, <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/cashmerecat"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">those remixes</a> played in turn by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"" target=""_blank"">Hudson Mohawke</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"" target=""_blank"">Diplo</a>. The guy likes pop music and that's most clear in the beginning of third song ""Kiss Kiss"" where a fringed sample is transformed into a bobbing chant, in a moment that can be distasteful until you realize how unabashedly catchy it is. Then, for those put off by that bubblegum, the sample is transformed quickly into a lush wail, accentuated by slaphappy drum machines. It's clear Høiberg has experience catering to two very different types of audiences. On <i>Mirror Maru</i>, he takes what he's learned and creates something that's sure to unite the entire congregation.</p></div>"|17408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17408-mirror-maru/|7.6|Jonah Bromwich

In between that show and this release eight months later, the band traveled to San Francisco and cut tracks at Eric Bauer's studio in Chinatown, where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19365-sic-alps/"">Sic Alps</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a>, and pretty much every other San Francisco band have recorded. They also changed their name: Faced with a cease-and-desist letter from a New York label, Sex Cult converted to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30734-ex-cult/"">Ex-Cult</a>.</p>
<p>That westward progression suits the band well, especially since Fog City and Bluff City have so much in common. Both claim small but active scenes that gnaw the bones of their musical pasts: Segall and his contemporaries find inspiration in the seismic rumbles of hippie punks like the Beau Brummels and the Chocolate Watchband, while several generations of Memphis acts-- as diverse as Tav Falco, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3645-reigning-sound/"">Reigning Sound</a>, and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7921-jay-reatard/"">Jay Reatard</a>-- have deconstructed and reassembled the r&amp;b swagger that echoed off the walls of Sun, Stax, and every other local indie label.</p>
<p>Those various strains are apparent on Ex-Cult's self-titled debut, which-- no surprise-- sounds like a Memphis punk band recording in San Francisco. It's never quite <i>that</i> simple, however: There are nods to nervy UK bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7616-magazine/"">Magazine</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"">Wire</a>, as well as to rambunctious Aussie punks like the Victims and Calif. crew the Angry Somaons (Ex-Cult covered ""No Fun on the Beaches"", by Mornington Peninsula's the Chosen Few, for the b-side of their recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14289-mpd/"">""M.P.D.""</a> single). The Memphians' sound is streamlined but not hostile, powerful but not brutal, with ear-catching flourishes peppered throughout the dozen songs: the guitar chimes that open the album, the skronky guitairs on ""M.P.D."" that sound like saxophones, the circus-geek backing vocals on ""Don't Feel Anything"", the co-ed shouts on closer ""Future Victims"".</p>
<p>There is plenty of Mid-South grit on ""Shade of Red"" and ""Young Trash"" to complement Ex-Cult's occasional bursts of West Coast melodicism, which may ultimately have less to do with Segall's production and more to do with the fact that Ex-Cult claims several members in common with Memphis indie-popsters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28436-magic-kids/"">Magic Kids</a>. For all its urgency, Ex-Cult rarely slows down enough to let those component sounds combine and sink in. It's almost too intense for its own good, with one jittery punk attack after another. But the twin guitars, courtesy of J.B. Horrell and Alec McIntyre, always find some new texture to explore or some new perpetual-motion machine riff to lock in on, and Chris Shaw, formerly of Memphis hardcore act Vile Nation, shows a volatile charisma that occasionally sounds constrained in this studio setting. Ultimately, <i>Ex-Cult </i>gives the impression of a band more comfortable on stage than off; they have a great sense of punk's past, but they're still getting a grip on their present.</p></div>"|17458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17458-ex-cult/|6.9|Stephen M.

Then she split with Interscope and resurfaced on the indie circuit, carting Jay-Z and her sister Beyoncé to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"">Grizzly Bear</a> concerts on the Williamsburg waterfront and offering up a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11645-stillness-is-the-move-dirty-projectors-cover/"">cover</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"">Dirty Projectors</a>' ""Stillness Is the Move"". At cynical first glance, it seemed like Knowles was simply backtracking and rebranding, hoping to claim some available indie turf. But this fall, she released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14364-losing-you/"">""Losing You""</a>, a gleaming and spirited new song that transcended the labels she'd been assigned. Released via Terrible, the label co-owned by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9711-chris-taylor/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Taylor</a> of Grizzly Bear, the sly single hinted at the possibilities open to an artist who eschews a traditional model of pop stardom. <i>True</i>, the EP that follows, delivers on the fresh promise of ""Losing You"" and marks the sound of a singer hitting a graceful stride, in her own time and on her own terms.</p>
<p>Producers and songwriters in the pop world sometimes lurk in the background, leaving the vocalist to be the face of the project. But Solange upends that model by presenting Devonté Hynes, her co-songwriter and <i>True</i>’s main producer, as a full-fledged partner. His name is credited prominently and he appears hand-in-hand with Solange at listening parties and in press photos. And <i>True</i>, a thematically consistent whole, sounds like the product of a lovingly forged artistic bond. The EP shares DNA with Hynes' solo outlet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29639-blood-orange/"">Blood Orange.</a> Like the best bits of his 2011 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15722-coastal-grooves/"">Coastal Grooves</a>, it feeds on humble but compulsively listenable tunes that reference the silken grooves of late-80s pop. But Hynes thrives in a supporting role. ""If there's a better voice [than mine] suited to a song-- I usually have a female voice in my head, anyway-- then I would rather her sing it,"" he told me during an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8981-a-small-pop/"">interview</a> earlier this year. ""It makes me happier.""</p>
<p>Hynes has met an ideal female vocal muse in Solange, who executes each cut with simple grace and yearning naïveté. These songs often reconcile girlish optimism with worldly wisdom as though the two are one and the same. ""Maybe I lost you, but I was not done having my fun/ Played around with your heart, now I'm playing around in the dark,"" she apologizes on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14594-lovers-in-the-parking-lot/"">""Lovers in the Parking Lot""</a>. And on “Bad Girls”, she captures the uneasiness of waking up in last night's smeared makeup and feeling unmoored: ""I look down on you, so deep down I know that we're the same/ It's stupid thinking that you would want to come play my game,"" she sings, ending the EP over a twinkle worthy of a closing scene in an early John Hughes film.<br/><br/>Like much of <i>True</i>, it's the sound of a complicated slow dance during a night's dwindling last minutes, fueled by pounding hearts and racing minds. The record never builds to a huge chorus; instead, its hooks bubble up quietly and quickly, then dissipate as the songs return to their downbeat simmer. Hynes tinkers with non-traditional structures, letting the tunes meander in and out of grooves, but while this occasionally causes <i>True</i> to fall slack (""Look Good With Trouble""), it’s a largely effective approach.</p>
<p><i>True</i> also benefits from its unorthodox length: At seven songs, it's fuller than most EPs, yet too short to be considered an <i>album</i>-album. Somehow, it works. Why add filler just to call it an album? It's another example of Knowles and Hynes forgoing conventional wisdom and doing things their own way. Seven songs can be the perfect length; a collection of accessible and authentic pop can come out on an indie label; you can reshape the typical producer/songwriter/pop star model; you can create unassuming music that still sounds like a big deal. And ultimately, for Solange, you can retrace your steps and find yourself somewhere entirely new.</p></div>"|17373.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17373-true/|7.8|Carrie Battan

But very early on, the group showed they weren't especially precious about their practice. Their 1997 full-length debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11600-young-team-2008-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Young Team</i></a>, was quickly followed by <i>Kicking a Dead Pig</i>, wherein <i>Young Team</i>'s tracks were subjected to sonic surgery by a cast of noted studio scientists that included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4045-kevin-shields/"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Shields</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1342-alec-empire/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Empire</a>, and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4402--ziq/"">µ</a></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4402--ziq/"" target=""_blank"">-Ziq</a>. At the time, it hardly seemed odd that the most undanceable band in all of Scotland would welcome the opportunity for a beat-based rethink. After all, in the wake of the late-90s electronica boom, remix albums had effectively replaced live albums as the default cash-cow-milking measure for rock bands (as acknowledged by the collection's piss-take of a title), and the ample negative space in the band's music presents producers with a large canvass to color in. But despite its impressive cast and elaborate double-CD presentation, <i>Dead Pig</i> ultimately sounded like random attempts at applying Mogwai's metallic noise to the darker strains of electronic music of the era (drill and bass, digital hardcore), to the point of using its entire second disc to determine who could produce the most gonzo version of the band’s epic signature track ""Mogwai Fear Satan"". (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T3l35zohFM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shields' titanic take</a> won in a landslide.)</p>
<p>Fourteen years later, the band's second remix album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48102-mogwai-share-remix-album-details/"" target=""_blank""><i>A Wrenched Virile Lore</i></a>, arrives as a more cohesive work, presenting a cerebral, alternate-universe reimgination of Mogwai's 2011 release, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15100-hardcore-will-never-die-but-you-will/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hardcore Will Never Die But You Will</i></a>. Despite its severe title, <i>Hardcore</i> counts as the band’s most blissful and texturally rich to date. <i>Hardcore'</i>s sound provides producers with more jumping-off points than the band's mountainous art-rock would normally allow. If <i>Kicking a Dead Pig</i> was mostly about giving Mogwai's atomic guitar eruptions a mechanized makeover, <i>A Wrenched Virile Lore</i> repositions the songs' central melodies in more splendorous surroundings. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48102-mogwai-share-remix-album-details/"" target=""_blank"">In the hands of Justin K. Broadrick</a>, the post-punky krautrock of ""George Square Thatcher Death Party"" becomes the sort of gently ascendant, anthemic opener that you could imagine blaring out of a stadium to kick-off an Olympics ceremony; Pittsburgh prog-rockers Zombi hear the mournful piano refrain of ""Letters to the Metro"" as the basis for a glorious, strobe-lit Trans Europe Express flashback. Or in some cases, the material is stripped down to its essence: Glaswegian troubador R.M. Hubbert re-routes the motorik pulse of ""Mexican Grand Prix"" off the speedway into the backwoods and transforms it into a hushed, Jose Gonzalez-like acoustic hymn, while San Fran neo-goth upstarts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28699-the-soft-moon/"" target=""_blank"">the Soft Moon</a> scuff away the surface sheen of <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/forkcast/15544-san-pedro/"" target=""_blank"">""San Pedro""</a> to expose the seething menace lurking underneath. However, there are limits to this approach: Umberto's distended, ambient distillation of ""Too Raging to Cheers"" simmers down this already serene track to the point of rendering it inconsequential.</p>
<p>Like <i>Hardcore</i>, <i>A Wrenched Virile Lore</i> features 10 tracks, though it only references eight of the originals. However, even the mixes that draw from the same songs are different enough in approach and sequenced in such a way that the reappearances feel like purposeful reprises: Klad Hest's drum and bass-rattled redux of ""Rano Pano"" finds its sobering aftershock in <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Hecker's</a> haunted and damaged revision, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/876-cylob/"" target=""_blank"">Cylob's</a> cloying synth-pop take on <i>Hardcore</i>'s opener ""White Noise""-- which fills in the original's instrumental melody with lyrics sung through a vocoder-- is redeemed by UK composer Robert Hampson's 13-minute soft-focus dissolve of the same track. Renamed ""La Mort Blanche"", its appearance provides both a full-circle completion of this record (by book-ending it with mixes by former Godflesh members) while serving as a re-entry point back into <i>Hardcore</i> by reintroducing the source song's main motifs and widescreen vantage. But more than just inspire a renewed appreciation for <i>Hardcore</i>, <i>A Wrenched Virile Lore</i> potentially provides Mogwai with new avenues to explore now that they're well into their second decade, and perhaps instill a greater confidence in the idea that their identity can remain intact even in the absence of their usual skull-crushing squall.</p></div>"|17374.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17374-a-wrenched-virile-lore/|7.0|Stuart Berman

On their double album <i>History</i>, though, West Coast rap legends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6299-too-hort/"" target=""_blank"">Too $hort</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"" target=""_blank"">E-40</a> are not only boasting about their age, they're cramming it down your throat. ""Our shit been poundin' all your life,"" Too $hort sneers on the first song, before asking if you remember sitting in the backseat when your parents played their music. E-40 uses the word ""sheezy"" on ""Cali"" before helpfully pointing out, ""I made that word famous."" Rap isn't a hustle for these guys, it's a life pursuit, and their pride in their combined history, and the ways they've embraced and defied it, is the underlying theme of <i>History</i>.</p>
<p><span>It sounds nothing remotely like a valedictory speech, though. For one, E-40 and Too $hort still rap about sex with the hyperactive eagerness of 17-year old boys about to have their third sexual encounter: On ""Sheesh"", E-40 compares a woman to a ""</span><span>Game of Thrones"" </span><span>character with the helpless laughter-inducing line ""Her coochie on fire/ She got that dragon crevice."" On ""Let Me See You Twerk"", he offers a woman his version of a compliment, ""You know how to make a pole disappear."" Too $hort rhymes ""you just might learn something"" with ""I'm shootin' out sperm, nuttin"" on ""We Are Pioneers"" -- a metaphor for spreading wisdom, sure, but the Too $hort-est version of that metaphor imaginable. Later on the album, he autographs your girlfriend's sheets using the same method. Nothing keeps you young like a persistent hard-on and a filthy sense of humor.</span></p>
<p>Usually when older rappers bring in younger ones for guest verses, it's for a relevance boost, but the young rappers that swing through History-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"" target=""_blank"">Wiz Khalifa</a> on ""Say I"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29472-tyga/"" target=""_blank"">Tyga</a> on ""Slide Through""-- sound like visitors auditioning for $hort and Forty. Wiz in particular gets off a more focused verse than he usually bothers with. Even Bay Area staples like Turf Talk, who has been around for more than 10 years, are young bucks in this room (Turf Talk is, in fact, E-40's younger cousin). This is adult swim, time for veterans like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27914-kurupt/"" target=""_blank"">Kurupt</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2128-ice-cube/"" target=""_blank"">Ice Cube</a>, and Battlecat to come out of their corners.</p>
<p>It's the presence of peers like this, though, that hammers home just how ageless Forty and $hort sound. Kurupt and Ice Cube sound nothing at all like their younger selves; for better or for worse, you can hear the impact of the years on their voices. Too $hort's voice, by comparison, hasn't altered its tone or grain in decades; It has a nearly <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-H3dztuC9I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Ozzy Osbourne-</span></a><span>level resistance to the ages. E-40, meanwhile, continues to light up every space he inhabits. On ""I Don't Work For Nobody"", he disses your girl because her ""titties smell like feet""; on ""Whip Out"", your money is ""so funny it's telling jokes about you like Wanda Sykes."" His storytelling instinct is still sharp and fresh enough that he can reel off three-dimensional character sketches like this one, from ""Singles"": ""After a hard night at work Erica/ Wake up and head out to Bank America/ The tellers wonder what she do and how she got it/ Because she drop off hella ones when she deposit/ Rappers be wantin to fuck, but she don't give it up/ Just because she strip don't mean she a slut/ She got a man at home with a decent J-O-B/ Work for PG&amp;E, but on the side sell tree."" To listen to E-40 is to meet dozens of these characters. </span></p>
<p><span>The production is split down the middle between the flashier, more carefree, hyphy-influenced production (E-40 calls it ""function music"") that has become the speciality of E-40's in-house production stable-- as usual, his son Droop-E contributes the most sonically inventive tracks-- and heavier, more minimal ""mob music."" An enormous chunk of California rap history is contained within these two styles, and Too $hort and Forty are their avatars. Listening to them egg each other on over the course of 34 songs is a pleasure, like staying up all night drinking with two disreputable uncles.</span></p></div>"|17363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17363-the-history-channel/|7.8|Jayson Greene

Some of his early releases were so murky and obscure that it was tough to sort through it all and glean his intentions. Yet when his music got ostensibly clearer and more accessible on last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15992-james-ferraro-far-side-virtual/"">Far Side Virtual</a></i>, the layers only seemed to get denser.</p>
<p>Sonically, Ferraro eschewed his standard blurry sheen. But by lifting generic sounds from ads, apps, and other modern technological ubiquities, he pumped up the levels of irony and cultural commentary. And despite the surface clarity, the music was still dense-- it turns out listening to a month’s worth of smartphone alerts and Skype chimes in one 45-minute chunk isn't easy. <i>Far Side Virtual </i>became Ferraro's most discussed and divisive effort, landing on year-end best-of lists as often as it got dismissed as a joke.</p>
<p>All this continuing chatter made what Ferraro might do next fun to imagine but hard to guess. Subsequent quick-hit mix tapes under the names <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16171-bebetune-inhale-c-4/"">Bebetune$</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16346-silica-gel/"">Bodyguard</a> mined hip-hop and R&amp;B, and both could have been meant as parody (or just afterthought). But Ferraro more recently expressed a desire to shed all the layers. ""You can contrive it to a point where it gets too heady,"" he told <i><a href=""http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/13838/1/james-ferraro-bodyguard"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dazed</a></i> a few months ago. ""I'm not always trying to be hyper-conceptual. That's inherently who I am, but I enjoy making music for people to listen to.""</p>
<p>He's followed through on that sentiment with <i>Sushi, </i>which is truly his most accessible album to date. Though smartly crafted and often referential to other music, it's relatively concept-free, with little in the way of ironic jabs or culture-jamming commentary. Perhaps there are jokes happening here that I'm not catching (and titles like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14307-so-n2u/"">""SO N2U""</a> and <a href=""http://youtu.be/HbZKXs0XH94"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Condom""</a> aren’t exactly serious). But to me <i>Sushi</i> sounds mostly like well-made, engaging electronic instrumental music, the best of which rivals that of any current producer.</p>
<p>What makes it engaging is its playfulness. Ferraro's loops often feel cartoonish-- not in the sense of caricature, but in the way snippets of voices and smatterings of sound effects add unpredictable humor. At best, like the whirring <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/b-e-b-e-t-u-n-e/02-jump-shot-earth"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jump Shot Earth""</a> or the chirping <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/b-e-b-e-t-u-n-e/03-flamboyant"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Flamboyant""</a>, he conjures a smoother, more soulful version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"">Black Dice</a>. That smoothness can get cheesy, but it's a sincere kind of cheesy rather than a winking one. And more often he's restrained and reflective, echoing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus'</a> laid-back atmospheres, albeit with less emotional weight than Steven Ellison is capable of.</p>
<p>That is perhaps where <i>Sushi </i>suffers a bit-- on the whole, it's more entertaining than resonant. Cynics might blame Ferraro's self-described ""hyper-conceptual"" nature, and assume he's mocking the idea that referential, artificially-constructed music can be moving. But I give Ferraro and his rather <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/James+Ferraro"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">exhaustive</a> track record more credit than that. In many ways he's a dedicated craftsman, and the elegant way he develops his pieces that creates its own kind of emotion.</p>
<p>Besides, some tracks here are genuinely affecting. The chiming lope of <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/b-e-b-e-t-u-n-e/08-jets-skis-sushi"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jet Skis &amp; Sushi""</a> suggests technology fusing with humanity, and the closing song's wavy tones and ponging accents are oddly wistful, despite the fact that it's titled ""Bootycall"". Those moments suggest what Ferraro has begun on <i>Sushi </i>could deliver deeper rewards, if this mercurial artist sees fit to continue down this earnest path.</p></div>"|17459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17459-sushi/|7.2|Marc Masters

On <i>More for the Masses</i>, they're still psychedelic, but they're also poised to bust out a new set of tricks. For starters, they explore the faction of <i>Nuggets </i>that found inspiration in Chess records. (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE6pYY45w34"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Primitive"" by the Groupies</a>? A thinly veiled rework of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP34u6rdscs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Smokestack Lightning""</a>.) Their track ""Texas Revisited"" is a harmonica-addled blues tune ripped right from the Rolling Stones' ""what would Howlin' Wolf do"" playbook. Plus, it feels like they've managed to get a bit funkier, especially with the groove and supplemental wah-wah in the title track. As good as the Lansing band are at crafting garage songs in the vein of the Seeds, their newfound variety is a welcome change-up.</p>
<p>But while the band's flirtation with blues riffs and harmonica feel like an intuitive next step, they make a completely unexpected move around the middle of the record. Previously, their jams have been bright-sounding psych affairs-- see their triumphant hook from ""Sons of Stone""-- but with ""Restless"", they start messing with shoegaze. Their guitars lose their bite from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13814-looters-game/"">""Looter's Game"" </a>and become outright dreamy. Everything slows down, their textures becomes hazier, and there's generally a lot more background atmosphere. The new sound is something of a hurdle at first; it's not a look we've come to associate with the People's Temple, and it completely changes the pace, build, and overall aesthetic of the first six tracks. But the songs are well crafted and well executed. Apparently ""shoegaze jam"" and ""psych jam"" can coexist fairly peacefully. And thankfully, their efforts aren't monotonous. ""Loose (Fire)"", the track immediately following ""Restless"", starts out sounding like it could head in that same ethereal direction, but their guitars get more assertive and their vocals get loud as the track goes on.</p>
<p>Even though they're slinging more spacy material, there's still a strong presence from the stuff they do best. ""Nevermore"" is a bittersweet love story (more accurately: lust story) that highlights the band's penchant for big, echoing, and moody guitar solos. ""Blinding City"" is bookended by fast-paced guitars and vocal harmonies, but the real highlight is the chunk in the middle. They dip into a minor key and slow down with a lethargic funk guitar solo while somebody screams ""WAHHHH."" Meanwhile, ""Looter's Game"" doesn't spend any time on solos or filler-- it's two straight minutes of tight, all-substance garage songwriting, and it'd fit in tidily on a Seeds or <i>Nuggets</i> comp.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the second half of the album slows down and never really picks back up. After ""Loose (Fire)"", it's all mid-tempo jams and even spacier material. Even though they do some great stuff with that last 17 minutes, it's sort of a trudge to get through it all. ""The River (Donovan's Song)"", for example, has interesting moments, but the track's full three minutes become repetitive. Even shorter tracks, like ""Fortune Teller"", add nothing but a decent chord progression and an empty 1960s garage<i> </i>caricature. It's understandable if they want to establish a more mellow flow to take them to album closer ""(Dark Dreams) Distant Memories"", which finishes things with a bright Eastern-accented chord progression. But a banger in the middle of that final clump, something like ""Looter's Game"" or <i>Sons of Stone</i>'s <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/hozac-records/starstreamer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Starstreamer""</a>, might make it easier to see the LP through to the end.</p></div>"|17412.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17412-more-for-the-masses/|6.8|Evan Minsker

But the real question that she and her songwriters seem to be posing on <i>Unapologetic</i> is, ""Who is Rihanna without <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10805-chris-brown/"">Chris Brown</a>?"" The album is designed to engage our perception of Rihanna the Pop Star and Rihanna the Victim, and the source of its fascination is the dissonance between the two. Its narrative, about a woman's miserable obsession with a man we know to be her abuser, flouts expectation of the traditional survivor's tale; we want to see a woman learn from that pain and leave it, not rut in it.</p>
<p>It was already difficult to separate Rihanna the pop icon, whom we think we know from her glamorous image and her songs, from the ""real"" Rihanna, whom we think know from the bruised ""Robyn F."" of her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/34569-chris-brown-arrested-for-attack-possibly-on-rihanna/"">2009 LAPD police report</a>. <i>Unapologetic</i> courts this confusion. We see the singer as self-possessed (""Good Girl Gone Bad""), a superstar isolated by her fame (""A Girl Like Me"") who is full of sexual brio (""Rude Boy""). This constructed image of power doesn't jibe with her purported rekindling with Chris Brown, who is most notable for Top 40 R&amp;B diarrheatics, a decent MJ impression, and, infamously, beating the living shit out of Rihanna.</p>
<p>Much has been made of the couple's duet, ""Nobody's Business"", which is, unfortunately, one of <i>Unapologetic</i>'s high points. They pledge their eternal fealty, suck face in a Lexus, and let the world know that the love between them ain't nobody's business but theirs. <a href=""http://www.acronymfinder.com/MYOB.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MYOB</a> is a tall order when your boyfriend once had to do an apology tour that included a stop on ""Larry King Live"" with his mom. The song's upbeat tempo makes it a shoe-in single with cross-platform playlists in its sights; she wants everyone to get the memo. But ultimately, it's a bubbly pop tune that conjures up historical memory of women defending men who have hurt them. </p>
<p>The rest of the album is a synth-pop slog that plays like the companion piece of <a href=""http://www.walkerart.org/calendar/2011/nan-goldins-the-ballad-of-sexual-dependency"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nan Goldin's ""The Ballad of Sexual Dependency</a>"". She's frozen in a relationship with a bad person and tangled in a toxic situation that feels out of her control (SOUNDS FUN, RIRI!)-- themes that are mirrored in <i>Unapologetic</i>'s surplus of minor-key treacle. The perfunctory Ibiza thump of ""Right Now"" reflects badly on both her and producer David Guetta while ""Fresh Off the Runway"" is capitalist braggadocio (nonsense grade) so static it borders on unmusical. The Auto-Tune on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>'s ""Loveeeeeee Song"" feature calls to a mind a dog vomiting while Rihanna, in turn, sounds like she's been roused from a medicated slumber.</p>
<p>Rihanna's stature has been built on undeniable singles like ""We Found Love"" and ""The Only Girl in the World"", but tracks of this caliber are nowhere to be found. Lead single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWA2pjMjpBs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Diamonds""</a> mixes simile, cliché, and metaphor, serving as a potent reminder that someone thought this was the best the album had to offer. <i>Oú est ma</i> ""Umbrella""? On ""Pour It Up"", she sounds alternately robotic and narcotized as she sings about how she's so rich she can pay for a $100 valet service and a night at the strip club and doesn't need friends. Plaintive piano ballad ""Stay"" is Rihanna inhabiting the post-Florence pop landscape, all chiaroscuro and natural voice. It is pretty.</p>
<p>The album closes with songs that are more potently disturbing than the attention-grabbing ""Nobody's Business"". With production from The-Dream and Carlos McKinney, Rihanna devotes nearly seven minutes-- a pop aeon-- to ""Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary"", where she sings, ""Who knew the course of this one drive/ Injured us fatally/ You took the best years of my life/ I took the best years of your life/ Felt like love struck me in the night/ I pray that love don't strike twice,"" over a riff that copies from the Police's ""Message in a Bottle"". It then becomes a florid song suite, mixing prayer and star-is-born autobiography. ""Let's live in the moment/ As long we got each other…"" she sings, pausing before the stunning ""I'm prepared to die in the moment."" It's a curious choice of words in a song that seems to address her life in the long shadow of her abuse: she told police that Chris Brown said he was going to kill her during the beating. The tracks that follow, ""Lost in Paradise"" and the awful ""Get It Over With"", further underscore any concern one might have for the pop star's romantic choices.</p>
<p>It's difficult to understand why Rihanna expects her fans to hang in this dark space with her (and Chris Brown). The album is unapologetic but it's also airless, nearly hookless, and exudes a deep melancholy. Given these qualities, it's hard not to wonder where else the album might have gone. Would it fare better if the topics were the same, but set to songs as combustible as ""Don't Stop the Music""? If her pain and shame and can't-quit-you-babe motif was delivered with some humor? If she kept her personal drama to herself and sang about rolling fat joints on her bodyguard's head and did more duetting with the dude from Coldplay? </p>
<p>On one hand, it's tempting to give Rihanna props for broadcasting her all-too-real shortcomings. She's quite a distance from the tidy narrative we'd like, the one where she's learned from her pain and is back to doing diva triumph club stomp in the shadow of Beyoncé. <i>Unapologetic</i> rubs our faces in the inconvenient, messy truth of Rihanna's life which, even if it were done well, would be hard to celebrate as a success. But the measurable failure is the album's music. On a track-by-track basis, the songs make for dull labor, not worth our time and not befitting Rihanna's talent.</p></div>"|17369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17369-unapologetic/|4.5|Jessica Hopper

Still, those two genres have rarely mixed in the time since-- you could point to off-the-grid acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27689-dalek/"" target=""_blank"">Dälek</a>, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/960-clipse/"" target=""_blank"">Clipse</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9658-hell-hath-no-fury/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hell Hath No Fury </i></a>has as much clangor, negative space, and nihilism as <i>Metal Box, </i>but<i> </i>the influence of post-punk on hip-hop has been mostly relegated to the theoretical realm. At least until now. Memphis rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29764-cities-aviv/"" target=""_blank"">Cities Aviv</a> definitely displayed an iconoclastic streak on 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15563-digital-lows/"" target=""_blank""><i>Digital Lows</i></a>, in which serious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4388-three-6-mafia/"" target=""_blank"">Three 6 Mafia</a> homage and a straight-up ""People Are People"" sample found equal footing. On <i>Black Pleasure</i>, he goes all in with one of the first rap albums that sounds it's angling for a deal with <a href=""http://pendusound.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pendu Sounds</a> or <a href=""http://capturedtracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a>. It's bold and possibly forward thinking. What's less certain is whether he actually made a good record.</p>
<p>He does have the voice for it. While an adept wordsmith, Aviv's vocals have a stiff and shouty cadence. At the outset, it's surprisingly effective. The militant kick drums that power ""Forever"" are the domain of no-fi coldwave revivalists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28699-the-soft-moon/"" target=""_blank"">the Soft Moon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30172-black-marble/"" target=""_blank"">Black Marble</a>, while Aviv's vocals are initially lost in impenetrable, well-bottom reverb. By the time he emerges to rap clearly intelligible words, you mostly catch the punchline where his insecurities have him ""hanging like I'm Ian Curtis."" It's something of a ""shock tactic,"" not so much in its allusion to a man's suicide, but one that can be cynically viewed as an easy ""in"" for indie listeners. But you can't really doubt his commitment, as later on he and his girlfriend are making love to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3408-psychic-tv/"" target=""_blank"">Psychic TV</a>, while porn star Mary Carey and Debbie Harry also get namechecked in succession.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <i>Black Pleasure </i>isn't a half hour of Cities Aviv trying to score cred points; there's plenty of material here that would fit within the confines of the searching and introspective <i>Digital Lows </i>were it not for the severity of the production. Aviv remains a relatable and personable rapper who's mostly falling in or out of love during <i>Black Pleasure, </i>while taking stock of his own situation and those of his peers. The most instantly ear-turning quotables come to the fore on ""Simulation"", which takes shots at e-rappers (""you thuggin' but you only sendin' shots over Gmail"") and pretty much all internet-based interaction (""with 30,000 user names which is the real you?"") over distended production from Green Ova Undergrounds associate L.W.H..</p>
<p>""Simulation"" is one of the few tracks where the words take precedence, and that's a problem. It isn't about the compatibility of Cities Aviv's influences so much as the actual mix, the way <i>Black Pleasure </i>sounds coming out of speakers and headphones. Nearly every production tactic that makes <i>Black Pleasure </i>so distinct ends up working against the strengths of its creator. The blown-out reverb and aluminum aftertaste won't be too unfamiliar, but while most rock bands using these tricks consider lyrics to be a non-entity or the vocals another sonic layer, Cities Aviv is a talented rapper who conceivably wants his words to be heard. The moaning sample that punctuates every bar of ""Escorts"" completely dominates the sonic field and the lack of definition on ""Remynd"" makes the appearance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29905-maria-minerva/"" target=""_blank"">Maria Minerva</a> a complete non-event. Perhaps it's meant more as a consumptive, textural experience than as a beats and rhymes record, but if that's the case, <i>Black Pleasure </i>forfeits its main selling point; so much of the production relies on the acidic, warping qualities of distortion that without Cities Aviv's <a href=""http://citiesaviv.tumblr.com/post/35628107400"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">instructions</a> on how he wants <i>Black Pleasure </i>to be heard, you could just as easily assume he was catching up with chillwave or cloud-rap.</p>
<p>At the very least, you have to admit there isn't anyone else making music like this right now, but it's debatable whether Cities Aviv is in his own lane here because others consciously chose to avoid it. And while there's no such thing as a ""free"" mixtape, since time and creativity are limited resources, you could argue that unlike, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/"" target=""_blank""><i>808s and Heartbreak </i></a>or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13116-rebirth/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rebirth</i></a>, this lacks the stakes of Cities Aviv putting his money where his mouth is. Maybe thats the real issue with <i>Black Pleasure</i>--<i> </i>it<i> </i>feels more laudable for its ethics and process than the actual product; even if it isn't felt, it can certainly be discussed, and talking points are probably more valuable than actual hits at this point in Cites Aviv's trajectory. But I'm more interested in hearing what Cities Aviv is capable of when he doesn't surround himself in so much figurative and literal noise.</p></div>"|17456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17456-black-pleasure/|6.1|Ian Cohen

On <i>Jummy</i>, Read reveals a dedication to haze and clutter mostly absent on his early singles, and it provides a necessary counterpoint to his Spartan loops. Where most producers have to avoid jam-packing their tracks, Read struggles with adding enough material. Because on some level, presumably, he could just listen to the choppy vocal loop on ""Let's Make it Deeper"" forever.</p>
<p>Read is one of the few producers confident or careless enough to slap a genre name on his productions-- house-- so let's use that. But this is art-house, and Read spends <i>Jummy</i> exploring how the idioms of that genre can be suffocated and then, at the last minute, let up to gasp for air. He lacks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22117-theo-parrish/"" target=""_blank"">Theo Parrish</a>'s brilliant ear for sound design (most do), but shares his hermit-like impulses and, increasingly, Parrish's abstractions of jazz and blues music. To put it another way, <i>Jummy</i> sounds like what Moodymann's <i>Black Mahogani</i> series might've sounded like if it had access to FruityLoops and Rapidshare.</p>
<p><i>Jummy</i> is built mostly from samples, mixing big, wet drum sounds-- Read records them from his own kit-- with short, cloudy bursts of Rhodes piano and mumbled half-syllables. Throughout, the drums are bright and musical, the melodies stoned and irritable. Fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28724-motor-city-drum-ensemble/"" target=""_blank"">Motor City Drum Ensemble</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> will find common ground here, but Read is more obtuse than the former and less free-spirited than the latter. Despite the prevalence of samples, <i>Jummy</i> never feel like a collage. It's more ordered. Deducing Read's track architecture is simple-- he does his work in eight bars or less-- and that can make his music seem simple; like staring at a great pattern, it's best to let the simplicity wash over you and to let the geometry tickle your brain.</p>
<p>Tickle it will, too, because <i>Jummy</i> refuses to fade into the background. Credit the aggressive samples or the distinct friction created when Read pushes those drums against them. <i>Jummy</i> closes with ""Sidecar"", a ghostly, pale piece that that screams ""album closer!"" Its formless, dim neon proposes that Read has bigger ideas for an R&amp;B hook than a great house track. But right now, Read is full of great, idiosyncratic house tracks and <i>Jummy</i> is packed with them.</p></div>"|17445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17445-jummy/|8.0|Andrew Gaerig

This Portland band's expansive psych rock sounds like it could go on forever, and most of their releases have in fact been culled from longer, open-ended improvisations. The way they slowly build these jams-- adding parts, increasing volume, and cresting in unison-- you get the feeling they're always playing, and their records are just glimpses of an endless stream.</p>
<p>For <i>A World Out of Time</i>, Eternal Tapestry's second full-length of 2012, the band took a less long-form approach. Instead of jamming endlessly and picking sections from the results, they recorded the album, according to press materials, ""as a whole."" This presumably means they performed one set of focused, purposeful sessions, but it doesn't mean there's a one-to-one ratio between what was laid to tape and what's included. In fact, this<i> </i>is the band's most collage-oriented release, offering varied sounds fused with hard cuts, cross-fades, and even outdoorsy ambience.</p>
<p>Still, there's more efficiency and clarity on <i>A World Out of Time </i>than any previous Eternal Tapestry album. While each song could pass for a portion of a larger jam, they all get to the point rapidly. Well, <i>almost </i>all of them-- opener ""When I Was in Your Mind"" is 12-plus minutes of wandering guitar jangle. But after that, every track is pretty concise-- most last less than five minutes and none go over seven. Remarkably, this brevity comes with little loss of space or freedom. That's probably because the group has so much experience at playing for longer. The chemistry they've built over all those sessions makes them able to step on the gas quickly and naturally, which is why they can make a four-minute song sound as wide-open as a half-hour excursion.</p>
<p>My favorite example is ""The Weird Stone"", a masterpiece of slow-burning, perfectly-overlapping guitars, all driven by Jed Bindeman's limber drumming, which combines garage primacy with jazz-like flexibility. In a flash, the band evokes numerous psych-jam forefathers-- I hear the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5843-grateful-dead/"">Grateful Dead</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5395-hawkwind/"">Hawkwind</a>, and the under-sung Japanese band <a href=""http://marblesheep.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marble Sheep and the Run Down Sun's Children</a>-- while adding accents and textures that avoid outright mimicry.</p>
<p>Some might find that last claim debatable. Admittedly, Eternal Tapestry rely on well-worn psych moves, some of which verge on cliché. One song, ""Apocalypse Troll"", cops a riff so familiar it must have inhabited multiple classic rock songs before. Another, closer ""Sand Into Rain"", sounds like a slowed-down tribute to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1131-donovan/"">Donovan</a>'s ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"". Eternal Tapestry embraces other tropes common to this kind of music as well-- at least four songs share titles with sci-fi and fantasy tomes by the likes of Isaac Asimov and Harlan Ellison.</p>
<p>But to me the band's commitment to diving deep into psych-rock tradition actually helps them stand out. Their unapologetic sound isn't an opportunistic gloss on the past, but rather a full-on exploration that enhances and moves history forward. Sometimes a group this versed in a genre, this able to tap its depths, is best equipped to further it. Judging by <i>A World Out of Time,</i> Eternal Tapestry's well won't run dry anytime soon.</p></div>"|17293.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17293-a-world-out-of-time/|7.0|Marc Masters

The still-young quartet started life as a self-described crust band, but we're not talking garden variety Disclose or Antisect worship here; Downfall of Gaia have always embraced the darkness within, and allowed it to manifest itself in their music.</p>
<p>They exist within the same vacuum as bands like Fall of Efrafa, Agrimonia, and especially Morne (who also transcended a more straight-forward punk past to create something much more complex and post-metallic), a realm that cherishes its prized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3105-neurosis/"" target=""_blank"">Neurosis</a>, Hellbastard, Cult of Luna, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4783-wolves-in-the-throne-room/"" target=""_blank"">Wolves in the Throne Room</a>, and Nausea records. Their first, self-titled demo was swathed in the same kind of muted, graceful passages that grace their latest effort, which balances out the measures of fervent hardcore punk and grating screams. They've just swapped places. <i>Suffocating in the Swarm of Cranes</i> relies far more heavily on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"" target=""_blank"">Isis</a>-inspired post-metal and mournful, cathartic black metal for inspiration, though shades of their grimy past and appreciation for Amebix's depressive, wintery moments are on display.</p>
<p>Instrumental opener ""[Vulnus]"" drones and heaves its way into the post-black metal spiral of ""Drowning By Wing Beats"", a mellow, mid-paced number that tempers its moodiness with a smattering of hoarse roars and athletic drumming. At first listen, ""In the Rivers Bleak"" seems as though it may as well have been written by Altars of Plagues, but slowly peeling back its layers reveals a doomier inclination and keening feedback squeals; its truly crushing mid-song break, coupled with startlingly bleak, beautiful strumming, make it a highlight. ""I Fade Away"" is unnervingly pretty, with lone, chiming guitar weeping into the void before launching into anthemic hardcore underscored by tremolo around the three-minute mark. They lose some steam around this point, though.</p>
<p>""Beneath the Crown of Cranes"" is a fairly standard amalgam of post-rock and angsty hardcore-- the pattern is apparent, the soft/loud dynamic is a given, and the next song, ""Giving Their Heir to the Masses"", is more of the same. ""[Asphyxia]"" closes out the record with the same earnest post-metal touch it started out with, and almost an hour later, the light's gone out. Each song feeds back into the next, and each clocks in at between eight and 11 minutes, with the exception of the five to six-minute instrumentals bookending the proceedings. The length isn't entirely necessary, though the album flows well, and would be a cracking accompaniment to a gloomy, lonesome day. There's fat to be trimmed and ideas to be fleshed out, but overall, <i>Suffocating in the Swarm of Crane</i> is solid.<i></i></p></div>"|17399.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17399-suffocating-in-the-swarm-of-crane/|6.5|Kim Kelly

The stewing bitterness between guitar-slinging introvert J. Mascis and bass-pounding extrovert Lou Barlow resulted in some of the most frazzled and ferocious music of 1980s indie rock. The acrimony was so deep-seated that, even after Barlow's exit in 1989, he went about <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um7kFyLmrQI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writing spiteful songs about his ex-bandmate</a> like Taylor Swift writes about ex-boyfriends.  </p>
<p>But the first official live document of Dinosaur Jr.'s original-- and following their 2005 reunion, now current-- line-up bears little evidence of the band's eardrum-rupturing, tension-fuelled reputation. Sounding like a crud-encrusted cassette that's been left to decay under the driver seat of your dad's Oldsmobile for the past two decades, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48151-dinosaur-jr-to-release-1987-live-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>Chocomel Daze</i></a> is less a showcase of a legendary power trio touring behind their heaviest, most incendiary album (1987's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11719-dinosauryoure-living-all-over-mebug/"" target=""_blank""><i>You’re Living All Over Me</i></a>, whose 25th anniversary this set is meant to commemorate) than a reminder of the seventh-generation Dictaphone bootlegs fans had to satisfy themselves with back in the days before we could dial up last night’s show on YouTube.</p>
<p>Recorded before a small crowd in the Dutch town of Nijmegen, <i>Chocomel Daze</i> wears its flaws proudly (the first minute of the opening ""Severed Lips"" is actually muffled to the point of indecipherability), leaving in all the awkward between-song pauses and background chatter that threatens to overpower the main attraction. The setlist is divided evenly between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11719-dinosauryoure-living-all-over-mebug/"" target=""_blank"">1985's self-titled album</a> and <i>You're Living All Over Me</i>, with the band aggressively attacking tracks from the former, while seemingly still getting a handle on material from the latter. (Mascis hits the wrong notes on the crunchy chorus riff of ""The Lung"".) But even with gnarlier takes on ""Does It Float"" and ""Gargoyle"", there's really no reason to reach for these versions over their studio-album counterparts. Aside from Mascis' phaser-pedal flourishes and occasionally hammy vocal tics (he sounds suitably repulsed during ""Repulsion""), what you get are simply more slack, sloppier, and shoddily recorded renditions that don't come close to inciting the equilibrium-imbalance that normally results from being in the room while this band plays. And lord knows, you're not going to get much in the way of interesting, memorable stage banter from this crew, beyond Barlow's brief shout-out to the titular Dutch brand of chocolate milk.</p>
<p>If there had to be a Dinosaur Jr. live album released this year, fans would've undoubtedly been better served by a hi-fi recording of this fall's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17050-i-bet-on-sky/"" target=""_blank""><i>I Bet on Sky</i></a> tour. Not only are Dinosaur Jr. a much tighter unit in their friendly 40s than they were in their testy 20s, but their current setlist contains some genuine revelations that better justify the canonization: a full-torque flashback to their pre-Dinosaur hardcore band Deep Wound; Barlow-bruised versions of Dino's more polished 90s-era MTV hits; and a searing ""Forget the Swan"" that gets stretched out to ""Like a Hurricane"" levels of grandeur. Had Mascis and Barlow never reconciled, there might be a greater historical value to <i>Chocomel Daze</i> as a portrait of the band's formative phase. But, as it stands, why stare at a faded Polaroid when you can still go experience the real deal?</p></div>"|17370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17370-chocomel-daze-live-1987/|4.5|Stuart Berman

He was born in 1978. It's not the first time the Long Island rapper has ignored the calendar year. After spending the 2000s in the major label hinterlands as a forgotten member of Flipmode Squad, he went <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind </i>on that entire decade with the release of 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14720-marcberg/"" target=""_blank"">Marcberg</a>. </i>On that album, he's firmly lodged in a style of hip-hop that never escaped the mid-90s, equally informed by the pimp posture of the 70s and the crack epidemic of the 80s. He remains in that zone today, but two years later, surrounded by rugged New York rap from artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29952-mr-muthafuckin-exquire/"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29388-heems-of-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Heems</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"" target=""_blank"">El-P</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/"" target=""_blank"">the Pro Era crew</a> (not to mention <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas/"" target=""_blank"">Nas</a>' overtly nostalgic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16832-life-is-good/"" target=""_blank""><i>Life is Good</i></a>), he sounds like less of an anachronism. Fortunately, he's taken this new enviornment as a challenge, and <i>Reloaded </i>improves on <i>Marcberg </i>in every conceivable way.</p>
<p>In setting and sound, <i>Reloaded</i> is most certainly a ""New York"" album. The beats are steeped in classic blaxploitation funk and understated menace, but the occasional glimpse of light and organic groove offers more entry points than the unrelentingly grim <i>Marcberg</i>. And where <i>Marcberg</i> simply filled a void, <i>Reloaded</i> can create demand among rap fans who look beyond the five boroughs. Roc's voice is more confident and distinctive and, more importantly, he's stepped up his lyrics. They've become something wholly his own as opposed to a clear stylistic descendent of anyone else. He's at a point that we see every few years where a rapper manages to accumulate the escape velocity to transcend the strictures of regionalism and become something that can be embraced by anyone who simply loves the possibilities that hip-hop lyricism allows for. It's ""gangsta rap"" in form alone, still presented as songs with hooks and structure, but the main pursuit is making the English language bend to their will: see Prodigy in 2000, DipSet in 2003, Clipse in 2005, Wayne in 2007, Gucci Mane in 2009, or Rick Ross in 2010. Or, it's ""lyrical"" hip-hop for people who don't necessarily think that term has to be the tool of the ""good guys.""</p>
<p>Roc Marciano pulls pretty much one trick over and over again throughout <i>Reloaded</i>, but it's an awesome one-- managing to stack one multisyllabic rhyme after another in a way that still makes narrative sense, without ever devolving into empty Scribble Jam showmanship. As a result, <i>Reloaded</i> is 100% quotable. Marciano's first few bars on ""Tek to a Mack"" basically sums it up: ""I'm back for the crown, baby/ In the Avi' that's brown like gravy/ Style's wavy, lazy eye Tracy McGrady/ Deliver like an 80-pound baby."" ""Pistolier"" is another astounding example of Marciano's limitless facility with gun talk: ""diamond choker, we bonded at the Ponderosa/ Islamic culture put the copper in the toaster/ Pot smoker drive the Rover with the silent motor/ Mama I'm vulgar my persona got the fly aroma."" Even better is how Roc is realizing the inherent comedy in all of this absurd wordplay. Closer ""The Man"" is something closer to straight punchline stand-up, as Roc comes up with the best NBA namedrops in recent memory over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27670-doom/"" target=""_blank"">DOOM</a>-style soul cheese (""sniff the Chris Mullin off the envelope,"" ""the 4-4's chrome with the long nose, call it Ginobili""). Did you enjoy any of those? Great, because the whole album is pretty much that all the time, thrilling and incredibly nerdy, like watching the best Street Fighter II player in town rule the local arcade.<br/><br/>Based on the above, <i>Reloaded</i> should be something of a minor classic. But if you still consider hip-hop to be a triangulation of beats, rhymes, and life, it's the last of the three that ultimately limits its ceiling. Quite simply, nothing happens on <i>Reloaded</i>. At all. That's something of an overstatement, obviously: Most of the time, Roc and his associates will plot on your demise and execute it with ease, at which point they will have their way with your woman and celebrate over top-shelf liquor. Then they'll probably buy more guns. That's the plot of nearly every single track on <i>Reloaded</i>. Yet none of this seems to be happening in the present tense and it's easy to imagine Roc rapping the entirety of <i>Reloaded</i> from a podium, like it's simply a 55-minute lecture on wordplay. There's an almost wholesale dearth of storytelling and aside from the still rather vague encomium of ""Thug's Prayer, Pt. 2"", not a single personal detail.<br/><br/>But <i>Reloaded</i>'s narrow brand of lyrical genius is so captivating on a second-by-second basis that these criticisms feel misplaced or even irrelevant. Though his appeal runs deep, Roc Marciano is a specialist and the flipside of the consensus praise granted to universal, emotive, and ambitious hip hop records like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/"" target=""_blank""><i>Good Kid, m.A.A.d. City </i></a>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/"" target=""_blank""><i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i></a> is that specialists tend to get underrated or overlooked. A rapper doesn't have to be everything to everyone, especially if their strengths lie in making antisocial, verbally virtuosic beatdown hip-hop-- after all, look what happened to Mobb Deep when they started making <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML-X8sLSsjI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">love songs</a>. And if you simply want a rap album that will inspire all-caps quote sprees on Twitter or hourlong Gchat exchanges with your fellow microphone fiends, it really doesn't get any better than <i>Reloaded</i>.</p></div>"|17301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17301-reloaded/|8.1|Ian Cohen

Too often, though, rap fans get stuck in the pursuit of being dazzled, of being reminded why rappers can rap and we (often) can't. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30729-ratking/"" target=""_blank"">Ratking</a>, a four-piece rap group from New York, is led by the 18-year-old Wiki, whose <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9QdEfruq_0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wikispeaks""</a> single from earlier this year made minor waves across the web. Wiki, as he's likely been told countless times, sounds remarkably like a young Eminem when he raps, and his taut, elastic flow means he can actually do a pretty good homage. It's that flow that is his (and the band's) calling card, but the flair is mostly a distraction laid over the top of their <i>Wiki93 </i>EP, which reveals a group of kids still searching for something to say.</p>
<p>The idea of having ""something to say,"" is itself a distorted one in hip-hop-- ""something"" doesn't always have to be life-altering truths. But having an identifiable point-of-view is almost always crucial to becoming a worthwhile rapper and to catching on with an audience. Ratking are nipping at the heels of a loose constellation of rap groups-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30324-odd-future/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips/"" target=""_blank"">Death Grips</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/"" target=""_blank"">Joey Bada$$' Pro Era</a>-- that have caught on in the last year or two by presenting new perspectives. Ratking come from a hardcore background (Wiki played Germs covers in high school) and are aesthetically guided by early-90s New York rap, but they have yet to progress beyond the facade of teen male angst. </p>
<p>Even Odd Future, fellow skate-rappers who may be their most obvious peer in this regard, had quietly constructed a deeply nihilistic world unto itself. <i>Wiki93 </i>is for teenage punks, too, but there's nothing at the core of the EP that illuminates the inspirations of Wiki and fellow MC Hak. Tyler, the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt, for instance, bonded over their missing fathers, and that pain was unavoidable in their music. In Joey Bada$$ you can see an old soul, one who has absorbed old beats and rhyme schemes and comes at his music from a place of love. With Ratking, you catch snatches of images-- kids scrawling graffiti, jumping subway turnstiles, running from cops-- but there is nothing deeper. Wiki raps about things that kids do, but what's the significance? </p>
<p class=""p2"">There is still some potential here, though. Ratking, four kids that call themselves ""mutts""  and are into punk, early-90s rap and<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/937-camron/"" target=""_blank""> Cam'ron</a> equally, seem like a zeitgeist rap group in some sense, and in that they have an untapped power waiting to be harnessed. There is also an obvious level of talent: Wiki's ability to rap well from a technical perspective almost works against him, but it's still a dazzling skill that could one day be put to good use.</p>
<p>There are also the beats on the album, cooked up by producers Sporting Life and Ramon. They are built from the ground up with hard boom-bap drums, but they attack with an aggressiveness and noise that sprouts from the group's roots in hardcore and punk. There is no dissonance, though, no skronk; they are beats made to be rapped over, but without a nod to the lived-in warmth and old crackle of typical 90s-revival productions.</p>
<p class=""p2"">""To every mother with a stroller, eyeing me when I roll up/ Know your kid's gonna be just like me when he grows up,"" Wiki raps on ""Pretty Picture"" and in many cases it's probably be true. But Ratking are a group that are a very long way away from turning that into a rallying cry, from not just embodying disaffected teen rebels but speaking for them. Being able to really connect with that fanbase-- the one that turned the Beastie Boys, Eminem and Odd Future into heroes-- doesn't come easily, and it can't be papered over with a nice flow.</p></div>"|17352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17352-wiki93-ep/|5.8|Jordan Sargent

The early run of 12"" singles by the pair occasionally felt like austere classroom exercises, with Andrews and Halstead racing to the bottom just because they could. <i>Quarter Turns Over a Living Line</i> peels open that sound, flushing some much-needed air through the pipes.</p>
<p>At times Raime's work feels like a logical endpoint for dubstep, a natural dead zone where all that rumination can come to an uneasy rest. But it also resembles work that's skipped the past decade or so altogether. Andrews and Halstead are self-confessed fans of jungle, and it's easy to trace the 1990s peaks of chilly post-industrial outfits like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3240-pan-sonic/"">Pan Sonic</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"">Autechre</a>, and <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Zoviet+France"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zoviet*France</a> here. Occasionally Raime's approach is reminiscent of post-rock, especially in their fascination with a bloodless form of machine noise, but also in their use of ambiguously wordy titles. One of their earlier releases contained a track titled ""We Must Hunt Under the Wreckage of Many Systems"". Much like the early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a> releases, Raime don't give you any easy answers, instead scattering a trail of malleable clues and ideas for the listener to get lost in and interpret as they see fit.</p>
<p>There's a sense of discovery to <i>Quarter Turns Over a Living Line</i>, with Andrews and Halstead unveiling the slow evolution of their sound over its 40-minute runtime. One of the earliest tracks is a version of ""This Foundry"" (retitled ""The Last Foundry"") from a prior release, which is tightly bound up in the kind of itchy oppression of John Carpenter's <i>Assault on Precinct 13</i> soundtrack. At times it feels like someone struggling for a last gasp of air after having a plastic bag wrapped tightly around their head, such as on the oppressive grind of ""Soil and Colts"". But the astringency subtly releases in unexpected ways as the album progresses, especially when the use of non-electronic instruments is pushed up in the mix. It's like witnessing Andrews and Halstead subtly chinking cracks of light into their sound, giving it a quality that lifts it above notionally ""dark"" works such as their rather hollow earlier output.</p>
<p>That lightness of touch is most apparent in the closing two tracks, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14528-your-cast-will-tire/"">""Your Cast Will Tire""</a> and ""The Dimming of Road and Rights"". Here, the sound of scraping guitar strings and violins come to the fore, adding touches of despondency and sadness that drag Raime away from their tendency to dwell a little too hard in a pool of bitter (and, on occasion, emotionally barren) brooding. Those elements are still present, but here Andrews and Halstead find a way to capture that knife-edge turn from rage into melancholy. ""The Dimming of Road and Rights"" plays out like an uneasy passage of time during an inconclusive argument, with both sides settled into an apprehensive truce, unable to find common ground, half expecting the other person to explode into anger at any second. It feels like Raime revealing a little more of themselves than they intended to when this project was initially conceived, a necessary and inevitable expression of connectivity that arises from spending so long depicting the solitary.</p></div>"|17414.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17414-quarter-turns-over-a-living-line/|7.2|Nick Neyland

Presented with a wide-eyed, almost precious demeanor, <i>FORMA</i> was curious and cosmic, though not terribly dynamic: Mark Dwinell, Sophie Lam, and George Bennett came off as intrepid sonic pioneers, gently forming otherworldly landscapes in ways that were effective, if too timid, in their simplicity. Looking at the Mars-like terrain on the album's cover, it wasn't hard to see where FORMA's collective head was, but it also didn't suggest there was much life to be found out there. A year later, FORMA return with <i>OFF/ON</i>, promising a darker spin on their sound. The cover-- a fluorescent slash of magma spilling down a black basaltic rock face-- suggests <i>OFF/ON</i>'s planet has generated potentially dangerous readings. And while the most engaging moments foster a sense of unease, or more typically a false sense of security, <i>OFF/ON</i> never deviates from <i>FORMA</i>'s designated path: it mimicks a crisper, slightly more realized version of its predecessor.</p>
<p>FORMA pull off some neat tricks over the course of these 46 minutes, none of which just any average cosmonaut with an arsenal of analog machines could easily do. Clearly there's a vested interest in the early electronic thrummings coming out of Germany in the late 70s and early 80s, as some of their own equipment dates back to around that time. So it's to be expected that the sounds FORMA are using are naturally fairly sterile and cold. But instead of trying to replicate those moods and atmospheres, FORMA approach their music with a sense of warmth and wonder, manipulating and balancing the familiar to create tracks the signify discovery, rebirth, and exploration. ""FORMA306C"" feels like a krautrock muscle relaxer, swaying back and forth like tipsy ocean liner, while ""FORMA286B"" boasts an array of dizzily playful components that practically orbit around your head.</p>
<p>FORMA aren't necessarily forthcoming with their secrets, concealing or downplaying the most interesting elements with a shaded and understated approach that invites you to either simply sink in or tune out. But underneath the surface-- and upon close, repeated listens-- the details begin to emerge. It's clear that there's something nefarious going on in opener ""OFF"", thanks to those telling, Carpenter-like nightmare arpeggiations, but more nuanced tracks like ""FORMA278"" benefit from slight drops in barometric pressure that add a dimension of disquietude to what could otherwise be described as music better suited to accompany an episode of ""NOVA."" An even better example is closer ""FORMA315"", an uncharacteristically beat-driven piece that is not only daydream-y but slightly scared and remorseful.</p>
<p>The only real problem is that in the event that you can't give <i>OFF/ON</i> your full, undivided attention, colors begin to blur and the music slips into the background. Taking into consideration the way that FORMA serialize their song titles with seemingly meaningless numbers, <i>OFF/ON</i> can feel like a smattering of random entries plucked from larger catalog, one that's ever-expanding and dictated by an algorithm that mutates only ever so slightly from sample to sample. In this light, the attention to detail-- on the part of both the listener and the producer-- is all the more important, especially when the risk of things becoming repetitive and interchangeable runs this high.</p>
<p>But at its core, <i>OFF/ON</i> is a solid record that thrives on the idea of possibility and hedged optimism. Listening for a first time, it's hard not to draw parallels between <i>OFF/ON</i> and <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/9608140/Felix-Baumgartner-watch-the-jump.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">daredevil Felix Baumgartner's record breaking space jump</a> last month. As it ran live, major news outlets cut away from his video feed in case the unthinkable were to happen. For some, the suspense was unbearable, but for others, the fact that everything had been so carefully planned and meticulously ordered, the chance that this human rocket would accidentally drill himself into the earth's crust seemed surprisingly slim. Instead, you were left blind to a sense of possibility and wonder that, in your own head, was all the more vivid and rewarding than the actual footage could ever be.</p></div>"|17440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17440-off-on/|6.7|Zach Kelly

The most dangerous record of 1967 has been absorbed into the establishment rock canon; the paradoxical fame it earned from its hilariously terrible sales figures in its early years has been negated by reissue after deluxe-edition reissue; and its transgressive kinky-druggy menace has been smothered by the embrace of millions of overly precious Wes Anderson acolytes. Is a limited-edition ""super deluxe"" six-disc box set really going to help restore any of the ineffable outsider cool that it's lost over the years? Actually, yeah, it is.</p>
<p>The new super deluxe edition of <i>TVU&amp;N</i> consists of a new stereo remaster of the album, a new mono remaster (both taken from the original tapes), a disc of alternate versions and mixes of the songs, a disc of practice sessions recorded at Andy Warhol's Factory, a live recording from around the time the album was recorded (spread across two discs), and a remaster of Nico's solo debut, <i>Chelsea Girl</i>, which the Velvets performed on. So aside from the 45 minutes of <i>Chelsea Girl</i>, you've got five hours of essentially the same 11 songs presented over and over in various levels of audio fidelity. On paper it may seem indulgent, but listening through the entire massive collection of material results in a sharper-edged portrait of the group than there's ever been, with all of the danger filled back in.</p>
<p>First there's the album proper. The remastering process was handled by Bill Levenson, who's been working on Velvets material since the mid-80s rarities collections <i>VU</i> and <i>Another VU</i>, and who oversaw the 1995 <i>Peel Slowly and See</i> box set that collected all of the group's studio recordings. Levenson knows the material well enough to keep from making it sound too clean. The amp hiss, tape saturation, and overall grit that made <i>TVU&amp;N </i>leap out from the scores of mannered psychedelic rock albums released around the same time is still firmly in place; it's just that the grit sounds better. </p>
<p>The stereo mix breathes in a way that the album never has before. As incredible as it sounds, though, the mono version on the second disc provides the set's first moment of serious revelation: It doesn't breathe at all. In fact, with every throbbing bassline and squalling viola set dead center, the mix is suffocating. The transformative effect it has on the songs is unreal. Lou-fronted rockers like ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" and ""Run, Run, Run"" leap out from the speakers with an aggression that other versions lack. ""All Tomorrow's Parties"", ""Venus in Furs"", and ""The Black Angel's Death Song"" are oppressively noisy, but pleasurably so. It's a sensual sensory overload that underlines just how successful the group was at the music-as-S&amp;M game it was playing with listeners.</p>
<p>Disc four is even rawer, and removes the last bit of remaining studio refinement to expose the Velvets' primal proto-punk heart. The first half is a reproduction of the one-of-a-kind acetate discovered by a record collector in a New York City street sale in 2002-- and sold on eBay a few years later for over $25,000-- that contained the first version of the album that the band delivered to Columbia Records (and which the label rejected). Some of the tracks would end up on the version of album that Verve issued after taming them down during another round of mixing; others were re-recorded entirely. Compared to the familiar finished version the material sounds unhinged. Moe Tucker's rudimentary drumming on an alternate version of ""Heroin"" is primitive to the extreme, while the original mix of ""Femme Fatale"" place a bizarre falsetto backing vocal from one of the male members high enough in the mix to put a listener on edge. And since the audio's taken straight from a beat-up acetate the whole fantastic mess is covered in crackles and hiss.</p>
<p>The rest of disc four is pulled from a taped rehearsal at the Factory a few months before the Scepter sessions, previously available in bootleg form. Parts of it are more interesting than listenable, like the band dicking around while Lou Reed patiently attempts to explain the lyrics to ""Venus in Furs"" to Nico. Other parts are jaw-dropping, like a version of ""Run, Run, Run"" that quickly turns itself inside out and transforms into a frenetic, semi-improvised Bo Diddley impression that's denser and heavier than almost anything else in the Velvets' catalog and can demand repeat plays back to back.</p>
<p>What makes moments like this, and the set in general, so compelling is that you get a picture of the group as a living, breathing band, separate from the performances that would be frozen in time and started on a long march to iconhood a little over a year later. For a minute-- or sometimes for 12-- you get a sense of what they really were, which is just another garage outfit hopped up on pills and playing rock'n'roll music so hard that it starts flinging off parts. The difference is that their garage was the Factory, and that they were willing to ride it far closer to fully falling apart than anyone else.</p>
<p>That's the image that sustains the final two discs, which together comprise a bootlegged live set from Columbus, Ohio's Valleydale Ballroom in November, 1966, four months or so before <i>TVU&amp;N</i> was released. While someone-- maybe a devoted fan of the Factory scene-- yells out Nico's name when she introduces ""All Tomorrow's Parties"", you get the very clear idea that very few people in the crowd know who the Velvet Underground are, or like what they're playing. You can hear maybe two or three members of the audience clap after the opener ""Melody Laughter"", a 28-minute jam that's mostly noisy drone with a brief pop coda at the end. After a feedback-filled scorched-earth rendition of ""Black Angel's Death Song"", Lou Reed snarls at the audience, ""If it's too loud for <i>you</i>, you move back."" </p>
<p>A few months later, right after the release of <i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i>, the group would convene to record parts of Nico's <i>Chelsea Girl</i>, which is a fine baroque folk-pop album, but nothing approaching that first record. The three other LPs the group recorded before Reed left the band almost four years after that show were great in their own rights, but paled in comparison to <i>TVU&amp;N</i>. Listening to the live recording and hearing the silences between the songs, though, it's easy to imagine a roomful of people being pummeled by this strange, intimidating noise, and seeking safety in the back of the room, completely unaware that the band they're being assaulted by was at that moment (and for not much longer), the best in the world.</p></div>"|17129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17129-the-velvet-underground-nico/|9.0|Miles Raymer

The Tennessee native bought into that narrative herself while living in the electronic hub of Berlin, where, though she played with a band named Electrocute, <a href=""http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/magazine/holly-herndon-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she began taking contrabass lessons</a>. Her hope was that if she could master a ""real instrument,"" she might, one day, be taken seriously as a composer. But after returning stateside to study at the electronic sanctum of California's Mills College, she realized that her laptop-- a web of code and a fountain of sound-- could make music as personal, intimate, and important as that of any ensemble. ""This is actually the most interesting instrument for me,"" she told <i>FACT</i>. ""I also think that it's the most personal instrument that the world has ever seen.""</p>
<p>Many people might balk at that idea, that a computer is somehow a more personal instrument than the customary acoustic toolset of music. After all, how can a box of wires, circuits, and chips connected to a screen and controlled by fingers be more individual than a guitar, with its strings simply pressed by fingers, or, better yet, the human voice, the sound of someone simply singing? But, to an extent, computers are forever malleable, able to be programmed and reprogrammed to fit needs and whims and, in turn, to alter those old modes of expression in ways that they couldn't do themselves. On her proper full-length debut <i>Movement</i>, the California-based composer uses her crystalline voice as a chief input for her laptop, ultimately arriving at a poignant nexus of electronic accessibility and experimentation that owes as much to her academic forebears as her club contemporaries. It's a record with the rare capacity to turn cynics who might scoff at the idea of laptops-as-intimate-instruments into believers.</p>
<p>It seems overly convenient and coincidental to compare Herndon's <i>Movement</i> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28822-laurel-halo/"" target=""_blank"">Laurel Halo</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16692-quarantine/"" target=""_blank"">Quarantine</a></i>. Here are, after all, two American women releasing records in the same year that weave their respective voices into intricate electronic music that sits at the borders of pop, dance, and more esoteric forms. The links are reductive enough to be insulting. But both <i>Movement</i> and <i>Quarantine</i> are bold records, dependent upon a multiplicity of voices from one source to press against borders of populist versus experimental media-- or, better yet, to unite them. At times, both Halo and Herndon seem like would-be popular sirens, ready to deliver hooks to the radio; at other points, however, they seem destined for careers of gigs in small art spaces or extended fellowships at universities. But at their best, they seem like both and neither, composers and thinkers unafraid to elide convention, circumvent categorization and arrive, fully formed, at an intersection of things often thought to be mutually exclusive.</p>
<p><i>Movement</i>'s humanity stems in part from its variety of moods. At times overtly playful and slyly sexual, decidedly monastic and obviously extroverted, these seven pieces skip between feelings with a true-to-life mercurialness and unpredictability. Herndon's sonics are impressive; see the subdural bass moans of opener ""Terminal"" or the careful, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3187-oval/"" target=""_blank"">Oval</a>-like slices of ""Control And"" for proof. But she never betrays the soul of her music for the sound of it. During ""Breathe"", for instance, Herndon takes a series of deep breaths and scrambles the patterns of inhalation and exhalation. She splits the actions across the channels, conjuring an unlikely choir of dissonance and consonance. Sonically, it's impressive enough, but emotionally, it portrays the struggle to rise above the world's din, to stay centered in a bustle of hyperactivity. It's electronic Zen: Herndon successfully links an electroacoustic premise to a pragmatic observation. </p>
<p>Especially considering that this is her first LP, Herndon's ability to steer music that's simultaneously complex and approachable is astounding: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14432-fade/"" target=""_blank"">""Fade""</a>, for instance, should lure fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a> with its iterative keyboards and sticky arctic hook, but the structure-- or, more specifically, the way Herndon handles the beat in relation to her voice-- is a marvel all its own. Herndon frames the rhythm with her voice, syllables darting between its cracks like water washing through rivulets. But that's just the most superficial layer of Herndon's voice. Underneath the hook, samples of her singing crisscross beneath the beat, supplying counterrhythms and serving like little magnets that draw the listener deeper into the song with each pass. It's a perfect interface of machine and user and of intricate composition with irrepressible songcraft. Likewise, though the noisy 64-second track ""Interlude"" might seem ostracizing at first, it plays out like a miniature video game of voices. Herndon manipulates her own tone into blips and volleys that clash with one another in their own electronic Mortal Kombat. It's quixotic, a dose of levity in a field not known for it.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14568-dilato/"" target=""_blank"">""Dilato""</a>, the brilliant closer, is the only track that doesn't key on Herndon’s voice. Instead, she samples and stretches the patient intonations of classical baritone Bruce Rameker, pulling his syllables until they turn into a brooding, wordless chorus. The piece is <i>Movement</i>'s most unapologetically academic; it treats speech with such force that it recalls <a href=""http://www.ubu.com/sound/lucier.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alvin Lucier's<i> I Am Sitting in a Room</i></a>, in which the composer repeatedly played back and recorded a tape of himself reading text in a room until his speech hummed into howling oblivion. But listen closely for Herndon's own voice, which joins Rameker's most notably just before the three-minute mark. She harmonizes with him for a moment, singing one syllable with an operatic grandeur. It's over in an instant, but it's enough to reiterate Herndon's symbiotic thesis and to make ""Dilato"" feel like much more than a rote exercise in bending one person's voice into phantasmagorias.</p>
<p>Appropriately named, <i>Movement</i> feels like a progression and challenge from one of the year's most exciting new voices, producers, and composers. It's an invitation by example to move in several circles at once and emerge with something that’s brazen, fresh, and entirely individual.</p></div>"|17356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17356-movement/|8.1|Grayson Haver Currin

A recent subject was Himanshu Suri, better known as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29388-heems-of-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Heems</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a>, the divisive, allusive, and pop culture savvy rap trio. Heems, along with the usual pocket regulars (keys, wallet) and an elephant totem from his girlfriend, was carrying a $30,000 check from Kmart, given to him in exchange for the rights to the Das Racist song ""Girl"" for use in a layaway commercial. </p>
<p>When I saw that check, I was annoyed. But while complaints about materialism in rap are common, it's easy to forget that rappers are character-creators, to whom flashiness is a way to promote an artistic brand. If I'm OK with other rappers' excess, why wasn't I willing to understand Heems from within the same context? Because of the way he looks, or where he went to school? At its best, Heems' music raises these sorts of questions, challenging the assumptions and double standards of rap fan groupthink. The question that has to be asked now that he's been playing these tricks for a couple years is simple: Can this philosophy make for compelling music?</p>
<p>In short, yes. His new mixtape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48588-download-the-new-mixtape-from-das-racists-heems-wild-water-kingdom/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wild Water Kingdom</i></a> is the most substantial solo project full-length associated with Das Racist to date, because it merges the academic underpinnings of Heems' ideas with thoroughly listenable rap music. Though he's still not the best rapper (his refusal to abide by traditional rhyme schemes will be frustrating to purists) he's made great strides here and is helped along by a NYC underground producer showcase.</p>
<p>Those beats, unfortunately, are forced to sustain the album's first quarter. Heems comes out swinging on ""Cowabunga Gnarly"", a banger from producer-of-the-year candidate Harry Fraud, but quickly loses steam, and resorts to his lazy reference overdrive, a trick which lost its novelty a couple years ago. Claiming, right after you declare your appreciation Junot Diaz, that you're ""as smart as three SAT's,"" is fine, I guess, but the facts are unrelated. And the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28051-crookers"" target=""_blank"">Crookers</a>-produced ""Third Thing"" has a great singalong hook, but there's way too much nonsense in the amateurish verses.</p>
<p>Luckily, things do take a turn for the better. Around the halfway point of the title track, another Harry Fraud production (this one replete with gorgeous sitar strings), Heems decides to turns it on. ""Freedom, put the heat up, who scheming for cheese/ believe in them please/ they need us to reach/ a piece with the place/ that's filled with the trees."" These lines are rapped more fiercely and quickly than anything before, and they refer back to the family that Heems reps throughout the song, and the tape. And for the fans of the old Das Racist shtick, there's still an absurd Princess Diana line nestled a couple of bars later.</p>
<p>It used to be hard to tell if Heems wanted to be a rapper or if he wanted to make people who love rap angry. That's mostly gone now. This guy wants it, and his earnestness occasionally boils over, to the point of sappiness. Not sure if anyone realized that collaborator Safe sounds a lot like Dave Matthews, but the resemblance, and the resulting campfire vibe is enough to kill the otherwise tolerable ""Medium Green Eyes"".</p>
<p>More often, this newfound ability to speak plainly is a huge advantage for Heems. ""Deepak Choppa"", one of the best offerings here, is politically aware and seems truly angry, rather than bitter or sarcastic. ""You know that we could send you back/ at any given time/ it ain't like money that you stack/ money for a lawyer/ that's the money that you lack,"" he raps from the perspective of an immigration agent, before transitioning into a different flow. On the second half of the song, he takes on race, repping his New York roots and his family and asking that you test his credentials: ""I ain't black/ I ain't white/ I can't rap/ I can't write/ I ain't strapped/ I could fight."" This isn't a sneer, it's a challenge.</p>
<p>In rap purist communities, the inability of some blog rappers to rap well is a well-documented gripe. Hearing a song like ""Tell Me"", in which two of the most disparaged targets wile out out over a huge beat from Earth 2's version of Just Blaze (producer Mike Finito), is some kind of head turner. Haters are still going to hate lines like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30074-childish-gambino/"" target=""_blank"">Gambino</a>'s ""Rush Limballin while I'm listening to tUne-yarDs"" or Heems' spitting ""Chamomile tea that we pour with splash."" But those listeners will have to ask themselves-- would they hate these lines if they were coming from sources like Dipset, Roc Marciano, or Action Bronson?</p>
<p>Of course, those are the kinds of questions Heems has always provoked. Now that he's rapping well, that purpose is free to slide into focus. On <i>Wild Water Kingdom</i>, it's hard to argue with the beats. For the most part, it's hard to argue with the raps. You're going to have to ask yourself, if this guy is still bothering you, what exactly is it that you don't like? Because if it's the way he looks, or the references he's making, congratulations: you're now that guy who's too conservative to listen to rap music.</p></div>"|17251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17251-wild-water-kingdom/|7.2|Jonah Bromwich

Linda Perhacs' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6521-parallelograms/""><i>Parallelograms</i></a>, Karen Dalton's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9623-in-my-own-time/""><i>In My Own Time</i></a>, and Sibylle Baier's <i>Colour Green</i>, to name just a few, all got their long-delayed, much-deserved days in record store windows. And now, after an unhurried half-decade gestation period, 2012 felt like the year we started to hear the debut records from some of the young artists who scooped those reissues up.</p>
<p>One such record is Missouri native Angel Olsen's excellent debut LP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17154-half-way-home/"">Half Way Home</a>. </i>Her songs are struck through with poetic macabre (""I thought this time last year I'd be dead/ It's quite strange the thoughts that pop into your head"") and showcase a tortured, warbling croon that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/575-vashti-bunyan/"">Vashti Bunyan</a> leading a seance to commune with <a href=""http://www.royorbison.com/us/home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Roy Orbison</a>. San Francisco's Jessica Pratt calls upon similar influences but makes music that feels like a counterpoint to Olsen's. As with Baier, the simplicity and affectlessness of Pratt's tranquil tunes are precisely what make them so hypnotic. Anyone who appreciated the general idea behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5893-the-milk-eyed-mender/""><i>The Milk-Eyed Mender</i></a> but couldn't quite make peace with Joanna Newsom's divisive vocal quirks (or her love of obtuse, 10-dollar-and-change vocab words) might feel more at home in the plaintive, unadorned warmth of Pratt's debut LP.</p>
<p>Pratt is a young songwriter with a decidedly old soul and a voice that balances spry sweetness with husky grit. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14512-night-faces/"" target=""_blank"">""Night Faces""</a> has a weathered, world-weary vibe as she sings of shedding ""a million tears trying to dig myself out all these years,"" while ""Half Twain the Jesse"" moves with an air of childlike curiosity. The songs themselves also feel lodged in some liminal realm between past and present, devoid of references that might place them in a historical moment. But their sepia tone never feels like a cheap gimmick; words like ""brethren,"" ""twain,"" and ""bushel"" roll off Pratt's tongue so naturally that you quickly become enveloped in the record's self-contained grammar. The effect is cumulative, lulling the listener into a tranquil, meditative space somewhere outside the interruptions of the modern world. </p>
<p>Pratt and her acoustic guitar are mostly unaccompanied, and there are occasional imperfections-- buzzing strings, the faint crack of her voice-- that add to its atmosphere of unvarnished intimacy. Her chord progressions are neither neat resolutions nor mournful elegies, which is to say that her songs traverse that vast, somewhat under-explored territory between happy and sad (except for ""Titles Under Pressure"", which revolves around a hook that goes ""The next time, I'm stayin' away from this place/ I cannot make more mistakes""; that one's a heartbreaker.) Even when Pratt sings a line like ""All the lights in my life are fading"" on ""Streets of Mine"", there's a bright, resilient note or two that belie how dismal it looks on paper.</p>
<p>The last song on the album is a dim, crackling, live-recorded track called ""Dreams"", on which she's joined by a man whose voice sounds like a cross between Phil Elvrum and Fred Neil. It's subdued enough to keep the vibe enact, but his sudden presence reinforces what a quiet, private and secluded place Pratt's self-titled debut has been. Listeners who prefer their folk flashier or wrapped around memorable, poppy hooks might find Pratt's approach meandering or bland. But those with a more patient ear will find her a worthy and quietly distinct heir of Baier, Bunyan, and Dalton's homespun sound. ""There was a time before us,"" she  murmurs on the lovely ""Bushel Hyde"", sounding like she's perhaps found a way to travel back there herself, picking up some of her forebears' weathered wisdom and weaving it into her own worldview.</p></div>"|17415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17415-jessica-pratt/|7.5|Lindsay Zoladz

Unfortunately, due to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48287-pos-cancels-tour/"">recent health complications,</a> it could be the last time I see him live for a while. He was added to the 2010 Coachella lineup only days before the festival took place and he was quite literally the first person to perform that weekend, arriving to a sparsely-filled tent of curious foreigners and confused onlookers who almost certainly assumed they were supposed to see P.O.D. He acknowledged the obstacles, embraced the opportunity, and absolutely rocked that show-- he undoubtedly earned some fans in that half hour. Making the best out of a shitty situation is likewise a prevalent theme in P.O.S.' latest record of clenched-fist, politicized, and proudly Midwestern hip-hop. The problem is that the strangely smug <i>We Don't Even Live Here</i> feels more like P.O.S. preaching to the converted than attempting to make a believer out of anyone,<i> </i>lacking any palpable resistance necessary to justify the constant underdog pose.</p>
<p>To his credit, P.O.S. ensures <i>We Don’t Even Live Here </i>at least <i>sounds </i>celebratory. It features production from the likes of both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29337-lazerbeak/"" target=""_blank"">Lazerbeak</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8269-boys-noize/"" target=""_blank"">Boys Noize</a> that goes heavy on squelchy electro-funk, you get a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5976-justin-vernon/"" target=""_blank"">Justin Vernon</a> cameo on ""Where We Land"", while ""Wanted/Wasted"" and ""They Can't Come"" are near disco-sample rap, at least not that far off from something that could appear on a 97 Bad Boy record. For the most part, the aggro-punk abrasion of 2009's <i>Never Better </i>is jettisoned, but most of it is either overtly rock (the 5 Hour Energy-pounding opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47507-pos-enlists-bon-ivers-justin-vernon-for-new-album-we-dont-even-live-here/"" target=""_blank"">""Bumper""</a>) or implicitly rock, the drums always knocking and often taking the tone of real snares and kicks. It could just as easily please a Rock The Bells purist as it could a Warped Tour onlooker. #47 debut on Billboard aside, no one would consider it pop-rap, yet there are catchy hooks throughout, even if their clunky verbiage make them difficult to actually sing along with.</p>
<p>But it's not really a crossover of any sort since the appeal of <i>We Don't Even Live Here</i> essentially comes down to whether or not you're already marching with P.O.S. The vast majority of the record is rendered from the perspective of ""we"" or ""they,"" where ""we"" constitutes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24537-doomtree/"" target=""_blank"">the Doomtree collective</a> and anyone who has even some semblance of anger about the state of hip-hop or the economy. ""They"" are classic strawmen-- commercial rappers who are liars by definition, shady politicians, and anyone who has doubted Doomtree. So while <i>We Don't Even Live Here</i> is cerebral, not much of it stands up to intelligent debate, often vague and heavy-handed at the same time. The biggest problem manifests in a track like ""Fuck Your Stuff"", where a group chant promises that they'll be ""scuffin' up your Nikes, spittin' on your whip."" It's a weirdly dated image that's the first of many signs that P.O.S. has <i>some</i> kind of awareness of the mainstream. But other than brief mentions of OWS and terribly forced namedrops of Anonymous and Christopher Hitchens, you're left wondering about the last time he meaningfully engaged with it. Subliminals are thrown at the likes of ""All I Do Is Win"", ""Stunt 101"", ""Diamonds from Sierra Leone"", ""Run This Town"", and for fuck's sake, J-Kwon.   </p>
<p>As a response, do you mention Jay-Z's involvement in the 2012 election, or Kanye's benefit concerts, or Diddy's ""Vote or Die"" campaign, or that Young Jeezy made the definitive Barack Obama track? It hardly seems worth it, since P.O.S.'s reaction on ""Wanted/Wasted"" is the following: ""black president, hooray for history/ but that shit's still totally pretend."" What's ""that shit,"" and how is it ""totally pretend""? He leaves it at that, and ""Fuck Your Stuff"" is simply more food for thought filled with empty calories: ""fuck dumbin' it down/ spit ice, skip jewelry/ Molotov cocktails on me like accessories."" ""Accessory"" being a key term since P.O.S.' platform of revolution is so depersonalized-- ""they on some nonsense/ we on some non-stop,"" ""kickin' out your DJ,"" ""this world's got a whole lot of locked doors/ we decided not to live here anymore""-- the homemade explosives and other instruments of mayhem mentioned throughout are rendered as much of a bauble and signifier as one of ""their"" luxury cars. Hell, the title of ""Lock-Picks, Knives, Bricks, and Bats"" might as well be <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTR7yvONCV8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Beamer, Benz, or Bentley""</a>.</p>
<p>There can always stand to be more socially engaged musicians in any genre, but hip-hop has proven to be bountiful if imperfect on that end in 2012. You could hear the lived-in experience on Killer Mike's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16537-killer-mike-rap-music/"" target=""_blank"">R.A.P. Music</a>, </i>a record which balances blanket statements with tough questions. El-P's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16641-cancer-for-cure/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cancer for Cure </i></a>conflated sci-fi with poli-sci. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/840-the-coup/"" target=""_blank"">The Coup</a> filtered absurdist humor through itchy new wave. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips/"" target=""_blank"">Death Grips</a> might not be saying a whole lot that's intelligible, but it sure as hell makes you want to smash <i>something</i>. Even the abhorrently violent hip-hop coming from Chicago can trigger real discussion as a necessary reflection of its environment. Ironically, <i>We Don't Even Live Here </i>creates a world where P.O.S. is all too welcome. You'll never go broke playing yourself up as the solution or alternative to the perceived mindlessness of pop radio, but it doesn't matter if you're going to the club to get drunk or simply reading post-election commentary that confirms whatever beliefs you held beforehand: They're both forms of escapism, and <i>We Don't Even Live Here </i>just doesn't seem aware of how content it really is.</p></div>"|17214.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17214-we-dont-even-live-here/|5.7|Ian Cohen

Once you heard it, you wanted to tell somebody about it. There was obviously the sound itself, so hypnotic that it was immediately understood as a classic of ambient music. But there was more to it. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>The Disintegration Loops</i> arrived with a story that was beautiful and heartbreaking in its own right. It's been repeated so many times that Basinski himself has grown weary of telling it: in the 1980s, he constructed a series of tape loops consisting of processed snatches of music captured from an easy listening station. When going through his archives in 2001, he decided to digitize the decades-old loops to preserve them. He started a loop on his digital recorder and left it running, and when he returned a short while later, he noticed that the tape was gradually crumbling as it played. The fine coating of magnetized metal was slivering off, and the music was decaying slightly with each pass through the spindle. Astonished, Basinski repeated the process with other loops and obtained similar results. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Shortly after Basinski digitized his loops came the September 11 attacks. From the roof of his space in Brooklyn, he put a video camera on a tripod and captured the final hour of daylight on that day, pointing the camera at a smoldering lower Manhattan. On September 12, he cued the first of his newly created sound pieces and listened to it while watching the footage. The impossibly melancholy music, the gradual fade, and the images of ruin: the project suddenly had a sense of purpose. It would become an elegy for that day. Stills from the video were used for the covers of the CDs, and eventually, the hour-long visual with sound was released on DVD. The video is included with the four volumes of the music and two new live pieces in this lavish and impressive <a href=""http://shop.temporaryresidence.com/trr194"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">box set</a>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The beauty of the music is not easy to explain. There are plenty of pieces that work in a similar way-- the beat-less drone pieces of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe1UdPzKTo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gas</a>, a few of Gavin Bryars' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1lnSi7QWY8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most heartrending works</a>, the experiments in memory by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fafEPuR1WUM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Caretaker</a>-- but it's hard to quantify this music's special pull. Each of the nine pieces on the original four volumes has its own character, yet all are related and function like variations on a theme. ""Dlp 1.1"", marked by a plaintive horn sound, has the air of a dejected fanfare, a meditation on death and loss (it was this loop that was paired with the 9/11 video). ""Dlp 2.1"" is more of a metallic drone, filled with anxiety and encroaching dread. The source material on ""Dlp 4"" sounds like a soundtrack to an educational film, not terribly far from the warble of an early Boards of Canada interlude, but the chaotic ripples of distortion make it seem even more uneasy. ""Dlp 3"" feels like a snippet from an impossibly lush and shimmering <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoRSTRwGUSY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Debussy</a> piece stretched to infinity and then lowered into an acid bath. The moods and textures of these pieces are all different but they become more powerful in relation to one another.</p>
<p class=""p1"">There's an irony to the four volumes of <i>The Disintegration Loops</i> appearing here on vinyl for the first time, since the defiantly analog origin of the music is central to its appeal. Even 10 years later, the internet is generally a poor space for contemplating the end; there are few digital metaphors for the process of dying. With Basinski's pieces, the metaphor couldn't be more simple. This music reminds us of how everything eventually falls apart and returns to dust. We're listening to music as it disappears in front of us. Hearing the music on vinyl, with its inherent imperfections, and imagining the records changing over time, lends another layer of poignancy. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Given the central idea behind the project, the length of the individual tracks is important. The first, ""Dlp 1.1"", is just over an hour long, and its source only lasts a few seconds. To listen to the entire piece is to hear that segment many hundreds of times, and the progression from ""music"" to silence happens incrementally with each play. But the loops don't fade linearly. It often takes a few minutes for the obvious cracks to appear, and then the tumble toward the void speeds up at the end, presumably because the cumulative runs against the tape head had loosened even the bits of tape that were still hanging on. The process is so gradual it focuses attention in unique way; I find myself examining each new cycle to discover what is left and what has vanished. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It's possible to use this music in the quintessential ambient sense, allowing it to play in the background while doing something else. The sound is uniform and drone-like, so you can adjust the volume and not worry about it intruding. But there is something uncanny about the emotion embedded in this music. It never feels neutral, so it's hard for me to just have it playing in the background. Part of that is what I know of how it was made, and part of that is the nature of the loops themselves. Basinski has a rare feel for mood and texture. The sounds on their own are haunting, and Basinski has a wonderful ear for how a loop can work, how to capture these bits of incidental music in a place where there's just a hint of tension that is never released. </p>
<p class=""p1"">One unexpected twist in <i>The Disintegration Loops</i> story is that some of the work was later performed. New music ensembles have charted the progression and decay of the pieces and scored them for a live setting, and recordings from two shows are included in this box set. (One of the performances is by the ensemble <a href=""http://www.resiartists.it/it/artist_bio.php?artist=125&amp;lng=eng"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alter Ego</a>, who partnered with Gavin Bryars and Philip Jeck in 2007 to record a new version of Bryars' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYyziW0W0gY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Sinking of the Titanic</a>"". The presence of Alter Ego reinforces the thematic and emotional connection between the two pieces.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">I was skeptical of these live versions at first, but over time they made more sense. They bring a different quality to the experience and offer a subtle twist. The key to live recordings lies in the rests. Little by little, the players have to insert a bit more silence into the piece and hold that silence as they cycle through the same phrase. And there's something especially tense and uneasy about hearing this happen in a moment with live performers. It also makes it difficult for the audience to know exactly when the piece has ended, and when it finally does, they explode with applause and, presumably, relief. </p>
<p class=""p1"">I've owned many box sets and this is possibly the most gorgeous and substantial one I've ever seen. There are CD and vinyl versions of all the music; the vinyl is heavy, and the pressings are very well done. There's a book that has liner notes from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11745-antony-hegarty/"">Antony Hegarty</a>, <a href=""http://www.copticcat.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Tibet</a>, Basinski himself, and others. But most of the book consists of blown-up frames from the video piece. It's almost like a flip book, as each new shot brings us a little closer to darkness. For me, it functions like a more tolerable version of the video piece, which, even after all this time, I still have trouble watching. I respect it and understand that it might work very differently for someone who was there, but it's still difficult for me to watch footage of burning Manhattan in an ""art"" context. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It's been said that box sets are tombstones, but this one feels like a living and breathing thing. And there's an irony in that too. The obvious observation about <i>The Disintegration Loops</i> is that it's about death, but of course, life gives death meaning. A couple of days ago I was listening to ""Dlp 4"" while riding the subway to work. For the track's early half, I was gripped by the sublime beauty of the repeating music and I was lost in my own world completely. But then as it started to break apart and silence took over I started to become aware of what was around me. I could hear the engines, the rattle of the tracks, and the voices of people in the subway car. The music had me thinking about the biggest questions-- why we are here and how we exist and what it all means.

Both revive and tweak classic New York rap, and are expertly good at doing so. Some things just make sense, and this is one of those things -- or at least you'd think it would be. On paper, their collaborative mixtape <i>Rare Chandeliers </i>should have no trouble living up to its expectations, but in practice it reveals cracks in Bronson's highly tailored aesthetic. </p>
<p>Bronson's profile has ballooned this year thanks to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16425-action-bronson-blue-chips/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blue Chips</i></a>, his March mixtape with producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30321-party-supplies/"" target=""_blank"">Party Supplies</a>. It's funny now to think that just a year ago, it seemed like Bronson would never be able to shake those <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface</a> comparisons. But on <i>Blue Chips </i>he fleshed out his own character, one that acts like Tony Soprano, travels like James Bond, and eats like Frank Bruni. Bronson's world is a carefully constructed fantasy, but he has both the deep imagination and wicked humor required to make the persona as engrossing as it is singular. It is no surprise that in the past year, Bronson has found a kindred spirt in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30571-riff-raff/"" target=""_blank"">Riff Raff</a>, rap's foremost ridiculous yet rewarding character.</p>
<p><i>Blue Chips </i>was Bronson's breakout, but if there's one thing that <i>Rare Chandeliers </i>makes clear, it's that Party Supplies' production had a crucial hand in why that album was a clear step up. The Alchemist's beats on <i>Rare Chandeliers </i>are perfectly good, but they do little to amplify Bronson's character. <i>Blue Chips </i>was sourced using samples ripped straight from YouTube and the slapdash, madcap production almost imagined Bronson as the star of his own blaxploitation film, which is what the cover of <i>Rare Chandeliers </i>aims to evoke. It was also the perfect fit for a rapper who spits punchlines as they come -- the track ""5 Minute Beats 1 Take Raps"" served as the album's unofficial motto. In spirit (though not quite sound), the production was an outgrowth of the two's deliriously fun ""Contemporary Man,"" a one-off song where Bronson freestyled over a succession of 80s pop hits.</p>
<p>Five-minute beats isn't the Alchemist's style, and the precision here too often zaps Bronson's character of its color, in turn sapping the music of fun. There has always been a nastiness to Bronson-- especially towards women-- and that unfortunately gets played up on <i>Rare Chandeliers, </i>an album that is both darker and more stately in tone. The Bronson here is one who lurks in shadows, alleys, and cigar lounges and possesses little of the awareness of others displayed on <i>Blue Chips </i>joints like ""Hookers at the Point"" or ""Thug Love Story 2012"". The line between jokester and asshole is a blurry one, and on a track like ""Demolition Man"", you get the sense that maybe Bronson is starting to believe his own illusion. </p>
<p>There are times, though, when the duo strike gold; unsurprisingly, it's when they loosen things up and play with structure. ""Randy the Musical"" flips through three beats in four minutes, all of which feel like they were played by a live band. ""Eggs on the Third Floor"" likewise switches halfway through into a mimed cypher, which is essentially the ideal setting for Bronson's style of rapping. That's not to say that every Bronson song needs to be pull the rug out from under itself after 90 seconds, but that he's at his best and when his beats pump him with energy. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen enough here.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also songs like ""The Symbol"" or ""Modern Day Revelations"", where the very simple formula of ""great beat plus great rapping"" spits out enjoyable results. Relying on that formula shouldn't be a problem in of itself, but that easy repetition can soon offer diminishing returns. It is the same path that made one Curren$y EP indistinguishable from the next.</p>
<p><i>Rare Chandeliers </i>offered itself as genius meeting of minds, and the album's core quality speaks precisely to the level of talent involved. But there is more to Bronson as an artist than merely matching him up with a stylistically similar producer, and <i>Rare Chandeliers </i>makes that clear. It knocks, yes, but it's more instructive than anything.</p></div>"|17375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17375-rare-chandeliers/|7.2|Jordan Sargent

He and Amy Farina, his partner in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1413-the-evens/"" target=""_blank"">the Evens</a>, have a four-year-old son. It's been six years since the previous Evens album. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a> played their final show to date 10 years ago this month. Anyone waiting for that explosive band to resume operations should not be holding their breath: MacKaye is presently no more (and no less) the guy who sang ""Bed for the Scraping"" than that guy was the one who sang ""Straight Edge."" </p>
<p>One fascinating thing about MacKaye is that, for someone with a reputation as a world-class control freak, he's always been extraordinarily good at collaboration. Now he's half of a two-person partnership, in music as well as life, and drummer/singer Farina continues to be as much of a presence in their third album's songs as he is. They trade off lines, interject harmonies or commentary, rarely sing alone for more than a few seconds. (Her lyrics tend to be abstract and impressionistic, his concrete and argumentative.) Farina is a very precise but unusual drummer-- in the Evens, as with her earlier tenure backing up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24194-lois-maffeo/"" target=""_blank"">Lois Maffeo</a>, she tends to play really hard in half-time, or to deliberately avoid the downbeat. So a lot of the beatkeeping role in this band belongs to MacKaye's baritone guitar; he'll often strum at twice Farina's tempo, or hold down a pulse on a single note while she plays around him.</p>
<p>The Evens can work their way up to fury when they need to: on ""Wanted Criminals"", the closest thing to an old-fashioned Fugazi rave-up here, they alternate an assaultive riff with MacKaye's ruthless sketch of the surveillance state. (""Jails in search of prisoners,"" goes the refrain. Middle-age softness has crept into his enunciation, but not his politics.) Mostly, though, they let negative space do their work for them. They're not <i>just</i> quiet, they're demonstrating their command of their power by not throwing it around.</p>
<p>As careful as they are to avoid repeating themselves, you don't spend as many decades in music as the Evens have without having a sense of history's weight. MacKaye is also the guy who wrote ""Look Back and Laugh"" and ""Salad Days"" before he was 22 years old, and there are nods to the lesser-known crannies of independent rock's past scattered all over <i>The Odds</i>. The pinpoint bop-bop-bops and fluttering-handed guitar part of ""This Other Thing"" seem to be a tribute to another Washington, D.C.-area duo, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4263-jenny-toomey/"" target=""_blank"">Jenny Toomey</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8221-mark-robinson/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Robinson</a>'s early-90s project Grenadine; the ringing bridge riff in ""Warble Factor"" is straight out of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2906-mission-of-burma/"" target=""_blank"">Mission of Burma</a> playbook.</p>
<p>The only time they actually sound like cranky old folks is ""Competing with the Till"", a song about playing at a bar that didn't treat them as the true artistes they are. The boss complains that they're soundchecking while ""money's standing outside""; eventually, MacKaye realizes that ""to him, all the people coming to the show were just there to pay his rent."" The song's partly redeemed by goofy lounge-lizard piano playing and the Evens' gift for phrasemaking-- ""our audience is your clientele""-- but they might also acknowledge that they have a clientele of their own.</p>
<p>MacKaye once made a big point of being a kid, and now he's demonstrably not one in any way. But he's also always made a big point of moving forward and evolving, and of not being a careerist. <i>The Odds</i> is, in every way, the product of scaling down operations rather than of giving up or throwing the fans a nostalgia trip. It's fair to say that the Evens have set their target low and close; you could also call that intimacy.</p></div>"|17328.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17328-the-odds/|8.0|Douglas Wolk

Comprising a collage of samples over a minimal beat, it was a protest track released shortly after the London riots. Considering that Sarah Assbring was better known for chronicling romantic relations over those between social classes, it was jarring to hear her deploy samples like ""The police are not listening to them-- what do you expect?"" Toward the end, in her characteristic sullen murmur, she delivers the lines, ""Never grow tired of this pale, pale fire."" It's a bit vague to be inflammatory on its own, but in context, it bore a certain poignancy.</p>
<p>""What Do You Expect"" hasn't ended up on the LP she named <i>Pale Fire</i>, and Assbring has backed off from politics since then, focusing instead on the dueling forces that have preoccupied her since her debut, 2005's <i>Look! It's El Perro Del Mar</i>. ""In this world, you think you have no reason to believe in love or in anything much,"" she <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47593-el-perro-del-mar-announces-lp-shares-walk-on-by/"" target=""_blank"">said</a> of the title. ""Then one day, when you least expect it, a light appears on the far horizon...It's the pale fire. The promise of love and hope-- all consuming and elusive.""</p>
<p>A slight cop-out? Sure, though no one was expecting an album of fiery protest songs from one of Sweden's most reliable portrayers of romance and whimsy. What twists the knife is that Assbring has said that <i>Pale Fire</i> was inspired by the 90s music she used to love-- namely house and trip hop. The idea of a dance album from El Perro Del Mar is tantalizing: tears on the floor and a thick, moody fog in the air, as apt for dancing as for watching shadows. The extended version of Pale Fire's centerpiece, ""Walk On By"", goes so far as to include a whopping, very noticeable sample from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"" target=""_blank"">Massive Attack</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWmrfgj0MZI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Unfinished Sympathy""</a>, but disappointingly, Assbring's dalliances with the politicized movement and with the bold, era-defining chime of house are reduced to wan dilutions of the original inspirational source material.</p>
<p>Set those intentions aside, though, and Assbring at least stays true to the hushedly sensual vibe with which she's made her name. The title track punches in with a flurry of horns which fade to a tentative murmur and a resigned dance breakdown better made for moping than any frenetic movement. A synth zips its way around ""Home is to Feel Like That"", and its beat is initially as giddy as its first words: ""I just had to see you, I just had to see you."" But those words quickly veer south and become a farewell, something that characterizes <i>Pale Fire</i>. Each mention of love is followed by an annulment, and the closest thing to a straightforward declaration of intent, ""I Was a Boy"", is a delicate husk that's about as appropriate to carry the themes of a love song as is a requiem.</p>
<p>But most requiems aren't this easy to move to, and <i>Pale Fire</i> fortunately picks up the pace from time to time. ""I Carry the Fire"" is house inhabited by ghosts, and ""To the Beat of a Dying World"" clings tight to a steady, propulsive drone. ""Hold Off the Dawn"" comes off like an intensely loud synthpop track heard through layers of gossamer that slowly envelop the song. Somewhere in the mix are lasers, stuttering pianos, and skips of percussion, but picking them out isn't easy. Nothing's exactly immediate -- but that's hardly a surprise either. <i>Pale Fire</i> doesn't command your attention so much as wait patiently until it drifts into your view and then goes away. Assbring's said as much about the concept of love over the years; on <i>Pale Fire</i>, it sounds just as much like her stance on music.</p></div>"|17292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17292-pale-fire/|6.0|Katherine St Asaph

Telescopes. Stacks of VHS tapes. A grainy video of a comet traveling across the pitch black expanse of space. If <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"" target=""_blank"">Emeralds</a>, the Cleveland-born synth and guitar three piece, are known for anything, it's their ability to take empty nostalgia and flip it into deep introspection. It's a skill that speaks to their musical prowess as much as it does their sincere love of things that many people would initially write off as ironic.</p>
<p>As solo artists, each member has taken their love of ephemera and abstract ideas in different directions. John Elliott went cosmic, making music that sounds like it was conceived on a space shuttle, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29178-mark-mcguire/"" target=""_blank"">Mark McGuire</a>'s burrowed further into his guitar, creating gorgeous ripples of dusky sunlight-tinged music that sounds like the work of a band instead of one guy. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29955-steve-hauschildt/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Hauschildt</a>, on the other hand, is steadily molding soft drone, spa-ready new age, and breathy keys into something that isn't quite dance music, but isn't fully ambient either. On <i>Sequitur</i>, his second album for Kranky in two years, he manages to make the jump into intellectual electronics without losing the playfulness that made him appealing in the first place.</p>
<p>The most immediately noticeable aspect of the record is that Hauschildt is now singing. Sort of. His vocals are masked by a vocoder, rendered borderline indecipherable. This isn't an accident. In the press release for the record, Hauschildt explains that he wants to make an album that uses technology as a way of expressing androgyny. By mixing male and female tones, he's arrived at a vocal sound that isn't exactly either. It's a heavy concept to broach, especially when he could just as easily carry on without explaining it at all, but <i>Sequitur</i> is an album for thinking to above anything else.</p>
<p>Across eight tracks, he combines layers of glittering synth with smooth washes of mechanical hum. There are moments when this stuff fades too far into the background, like in the pretty but overly repetitive ""Vegas Mode"", which is technically accomplished but lacks heft. ""Kept"", the most explicitly ambient piece on the record, demands attention due to its gummy web of textured keys that pulse with vitality. If ""Vegas Mode"" is Hauschildt straddling multiple genres and not really pulling it off, then ""Kept"" shows that maybe he would be better served tackling one thing at a time. Which is not to say that <i>Sequitur</i> is a bad album. More than anything, it's a hint at what Hauschildt's capable of.</p>
<p>Today, you could walk into just about any remaining record store and pick up a wide array of deluxe reissues of long haired dudes from previous decades messing with synthesizers they wanted nothing more than to understand. It's great that they exist. Those records are often mind bogglingly ahead of their time, and are a clear influence on a new crop of electronic music obsessives, but they often feel like curiosities-- as if the end result was just experimenting with the equipment rather than using it to make fully formed pieces.</p>
<p>With the academic concept behind <i>Sequitur</i>, Hauschildt initially seems like he's part of that school, but when the album reaches closer ""Steep Decline"", everything's overwhelmingly human. On that track, cavernous drums boom across a tangle of triumphant keys, and it sounds like Hauschildt's attempting to drag emotion from a sterile soundscape. He'll certainly make better records, yes, but right now <i>Sequitur</i> feels like a step forward for a genre that could happily stay the same forever.</p></div>"|17360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17360-sequitur/|6.6|Sam Hockley-Smith

No antagonistic relationships with the media, no publicized addictions, no scandals, no suicides. Their legacy is instead one of hard work, perseverance, and pragmatism; after all, Soundgarden had already embraced the benefits of signing to a major label several years before Kurt Cobain had developed a <a href=""http://thepastisunwritten.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/corporate_magazines_still_suck1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-loathing attitude</a> about doing the same. Even the band's dissolution in 1997 was less of a bombshell than a simple product of boredom with the biz.</p>
<p>So it follows that the band's recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/37457-soundgarden-to-reunite/"" target=""_blank"">reunion</a> has a par-for-the-course, procedural air: Soundgarden are back together and making new music because, well, that's what dormant alt-rock institutions are supposed to do now, right? Even the band's would-be comeback coronation, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47870-soundgarden-announce-first-new-album-in-16-years/"" target=""_blank""><i>King Animal</i>'s</a> ""Been Away Too Long"", is less a statement of celebration than obligation, the titular declaration undercut by Chris Cornell's admission that ""I never really wanted to stay.""</p>
<p>Still, the return of Soundgarden is something to get excited about, if only because it momentarily delays the release of another Cornell solo album. And fortunately, the singer's interim attempts to reinvent himself -- as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaxI41Oqdfw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Jeff Buckley-esque crooner</a>, <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5maam_timbaland-vcast-commercial_music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Timbaland's favorite mobile-phone pitchman</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC5FdFlUcl0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wet-blanket warbler for a squandered hard-rock supergroup opportunity</a>-- have little bearing on the outcome of <i>King Animal</i>. However, your enthusiasm for this album will ultimately depend on how often you return to 1996's <i>Down on the Upside</i>, an album that scored the band another platinum disc to hang in their bathrooms but felt like a holding pattern after the impressive four-album progression charted from 1988's sludgy <i>Ultramega OK</i> to 1994's steely <i>Superunknown</i>.</p>
<p>On the latter album, Soundgarden got their formula of muscular hard rock, brooding, psychedelic power ballads, and acoustic mysticism down to an exact science, and <i>Upside</i> simply repeated those same moves to slightly diminished returns. (Consider how the surreal, bad-trip Beatleisms of <i>Superunknown's</i> ""Black Hole Sun"" got processed into the melodramatic and obvious ""Blow Up the Outside World."") Now, imagine that same formula rehashed and diluted even more and you've got <i>King Animal</i>. </p>
<p>The result is all the more disappointing given a strong start that showcases the band's regained command of rhythm and ballast. ""Non-State Actor"" grooves menacingly like a funkier ""Spoonman"", while the album's hands-down standout, ""By Crooked Steps"", reminds us that Soundgarden is at its best when making Ben Shepherd and Matt Cameron's stuttering time signatures, Kim Thayil's contorted riffage, and Cornell's glass-shattering wail sound like perfectly natural FM-radio fodder.</p>
<p>From there, the band simmer down into moodier, mid-tempo realms-- minus the skyscraping, MTV-baiting hooks that once allowed them to mellow out without boring the mosh pit. And after a while, you get the sense that Soundgarden are checking boxes off on a list: ""Bones of Birds"" is the ""Black Hole""-sized psychedelic centerpiece that boasts an affective, downcast riff from Thayil, but is bogged down by an undercooked, overwrought chorus. And there are <i>two</i> attempts -- back-to-back, no less -- at a congenial, acoustic-strummed exercise a la ""Burden in My Hand"" (""Black Saturday"" and ""Halfway There""), but without the anthemic refrains to put them over the top. Likewise, the rare excursions outside their classic-rockin' comfort zone lead to dead ends, as when the dubby outro on ""Worse Dreams"" shoots for trippy, free-form chaos but winds up an aimless, uneventful mess. The autopilot nature of <i>King Animal</i>'s second half is perfectly summed up by the repeated chain-gang chant of the closing ""Rowing"": ""Don't know where I'm going/ I just keep on rowing/ I just keep on pulling/ Gotta row.""</p>
<p><i>King Animal</i> makes for a respectable display of Soundgarden's proficiency, but lacks their once-imposing majesty. Listening to the record,<i> </i>it's easy to forget what a disorienting, brutalizing effect songs like ""Rusty Cage"" and ""Jesus Christ Pose"" had on the early-90s rock landscape, even after Nirvana had nudged post-hardcore-schooled noise to the right of the dial. And in the decade and a half that Soundgarden were out of commission, there have been many art-metal aspirants-- from the Deftones and Queens of the Stone Age to Mastodon and Boris-- who've aimed for a similar balance of brains and brawn. The best hope for <i>King Animal</i> was that Soundgarden would be inspired enough by their spiritual successors to want to outdo them, and set a new benchmark for ambitious aggression. Instead, the group's first album since 1996 just sounds like the one they would've churned out in 1998. </p></div>"|17300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17300-king-animal/|5.9|Stuart Berman

He spoke of his childhood adoration of Eminem and his preferred ""shock-rock"" tactics in approaching art and rap music-- an ideology that synced up nicely with the sinister, hallucinatory handful of Mykki Blanco tracks that had been posted on SoundCloud. But shocking listeners is a tall order in 2012, and adopting a Lolita-doll rap persona and snarling verses about doing mushrooms and ""white boys with them yarmulkas/ Model chicks with a million followers"" will earn <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/fashion/the-evolution-of-michael-quattlebaum-jr-a-k-a-mykki-blanco.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a glowing profile</a> in the <i>New York Times</i> Style section sooner than it will drop jaws. So it follows that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48505-listen-to-mykki-blancos-new-cosmic-angel-illuminati-princess-mixtape/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cosmic Angel: Illuminati Prince/ss</i></a>, Mykki Blanco's first full-length release, is a grab-bag of experimentation tailored to today's blurry rap landscape and transgression is only part of the mix. </p>
<p>Like many of her contemporaries have in recent months, Blanco employs a host of electronic producers who usually work without rappers, sometimes to striking effect. Upstart underground names like Brenmar, Gatekeeper, and Sinden offer up a broad, scrappy palate of beats crafted to get people moving. The Brenmar-produced ""Wavvy"", for instance, is a clear standout, weaving Mykki at her clearest and most urgent through an infectious slice of tropicalia. Sinden and Matrixxman's sinister ""Haze.Boogie.Life"" beat invokes the image of gooey liquid dripping through industrial pipes, mimicking the sorts of basement-performance settings that brought the rapper to life over the last couple of years, but made brighter and shinier and more danceable.</p>
<p>That's not to say she's only well-served by more straightforward hooks-- the second half of the album pulls heavily from Mykki's lo-fi early days, when the performance-art aspect of the project dominated. On the Katy Perry-referencing ""TeenageDream"" she's murderous and imaginative, hissing: ""Eighteen/ Mykki Blanco, teenage dream/ Homecoming queen, stroking woodies/ Toy Story/Denying me the black card?/ Oh, now it's statutory"" like she's at a poetry reading hosted in a grimy underworld. It's that sort of psychedelic, stream-of-consciousness flow looped through cartoonishly girly vocal filters that brought Mykki Blanco character to life initially, the character she described as having ""two sides: cute and criminally insane."" When both personas bubble out of Blanco in fierce equal measure in a verse, it's gut-punching. Somewhere, Roman and Martha Zolanski are furious. </p>
<p>Where <i>Cosmic Angel: The Illuminati Prince/ss</i> falls short is in the bloated middle ground between club and camp. There are a handful of downbeat tracks here that meander aimlessly, and some of the mixtape is rickety, as though it would crumble to dust under a little bit of pressure. Here you can hear Blanco's raps occasionally grow fumbling and flat, like on the washed-out drum-and-bass/metallic lighter-flick beat of ""Squanto"": If you make it to the end of the song's four minutes, you can pick out rhymes of ""solution"" and ""resolution"" through the mumblings, but there's little to make you want to rewind and decipher a meaning. You'd probably just as soon skip forward and revisit ""Betty Rubble"", one of Blanco's earliest tracks. There she raps, ""You think I was a mink the way these dogs was sniffin'/ You'd think my name was Homer Simpson  to these Peter Griffins/ They hangin' off my angry word/ Damn these fucking Angry Birds""-- a raw reminder of how thrilling her character can be at its unfiltered peak.</p></div>"|17350.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17350-cosmic-angel-the-illuminati-princess/|6.8|Carrie Battan

His starting point was an electric guitar, laid clinically on a slab, and dissected in neat, quiet strokes. Over the next 15 years and counting, he grew louder, bolder, and more ambitious, drawing in aspects of black metal, harsh noise, drone, concrete music, and free electronics. His music rose to a peak of vigor without sacrificing its subtlety-- no matter how unruly it got, the greater forces of Drumm's instincts stayed in control. His discography deepened at a dizzying pace, and certain solo works emerged as big statements amid the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10574-gauntlet/"">collaborations </a>and incidental excursions. </p>
<p>One such statement was the screaming wall of mouths of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2465-sheer-hellish-miasma/""><i>Sheer Hellish Miasma</i></a>, a refreshingly on-the-nose title in a field that often preferred to wreath its mischief in loftier concepts. Drumm offered other worthwhile releases in the ensuing decade, but <i>Relief </i>might be his next milestone. If pure volatility is the most exciting thing about noise, it's also the biggest hurdle for people who reasonably expect music to be made of continuous patterns. Returning to Editions Mego with this single 36-minute track, Drumm unites the best of both worlds. As on <i>Miasma,</i> he wrestles a great deal of hectic squirming into an impregnable monument that crumbles and crumbles without getting smaller. Gradations of mood, color, and weight fluctutate chaotically, but a tense arch of cyclic melody lends form.</p>
<p>The substance of the music is a dense but porous array of throaty roars, eerie baying, hissing static, rogue frequencies, tactile shudders, and other instabilities, oozing over and through each other. Ubiquitous high-frequency interference rises and falls, governing the intensity of the piece at any given moment. But even during its most violent passages, <i>Relief</i> is more entrancing than overwhelming, at least after you sink through its abrasive exterior and get used to its lulling depths. The energy coursing through the convulsive medium is slow, periodic, wave-like; smoothing the spatter into a blur. Sonority exerts a powerful presence, shining off the textures in prismatic overtones and turning inside them like a warped screw.</p>
<p>It can be hard to describe what distinguishes a really good noise record from an average one, but Drumm makes it easy for us. The question that all improvisers have to answer is whether something you play once can be worth listening to more than once. Experience and forethought ease the answer toward yes, and Drumm has both at his command. Throughout <i>Relief</i>, we hear a mind making choices in the moment, rather than just letting sound make its own. Stray frequencies or timbres sometimes spring free, taking on the character of cries for help, only to be swiftly tamped back down into the swirling mass. A noise record called <i>Relief</i> courts easy jokes about what happens when you turn it off, but it's funny-- when the storm clears and silence descends again, heavier than before, the strongest lingering impression isn't of random violence, but of the hauntingly measured motif drifting at the bottom of it all.</p></div>"|17362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17362-relief/|7.7|Brian Howe

If it evokes any lust at all, it's the vampiric sort, as if Gary Oldman, in all his blade-licking, scenery-chewing, Frau Helga-wig sporting Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i> glory, had composed a minimal wave album for his beloved instead of crossing oceans of time. Its stylistic antecedents are pretty clear-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a>, the Normal, and the earliest and most inchoate 1970s synth-pop experiments. But it feels very much like a keyhole peek at one man's private torment.</p>
<p>His name is Hannes Norrvide, and <i>Growing Seeds</i> has the obsessive feel of something banged out in one demented trance. The sound is corroded and thin, and some of the songs are so defaced by fuzz that they're barely legible. If you were scanning a car radio and landed on a station that sounded like ""We Planted A Seed"", you would grit your teeth and wait it out, seeing if the signal improved being plowing forward. It sounds uninviting on paper, but there's frustrating murk and there's haunting murk, and <i>Growing Seeds</i> is the second kind.</p>
<p>The limited palette works to the album's advantage. Listening to it, you feel pushed beneath the surface of something: It helps that Norrvide's fingers somehow always land on an instantly memorable four-note synth riff. The carpal-tunnel drive of ""Champagne"", in which two rudimentary earworms bounce off each other for four minutes, hits the same nagging sweet spot as the most hypnotically driving 8-bit music. The same goes for ""Cover Their Faces"", which manages to summon ""Plainsong"" grandeur with a tiny octave riff and tinny drum fill. The more time you spend in this flattened landscape, the more individual peaks rise up from it. Songs like ""Neon Lights Appear"" and ""It's You"" are synth bangers on a cellular level.</p>
<p>Over this digital blizzard, Norrvide drifts like the rumor of a lead singer. He's subdued, but it's the subdued of an emotional meltdown faintly overheard through three or four apartment walls. Behind the otherwise wordless blank space of ""We Got Lust"", you can faintly make out a woman's screams and sobs, an upsetting and affecting addition. Picking through the album to discern moments like this, like when Norrvide repeatedly gasps ""Now...dream of you..."" (""Modern Life""), makes them feel more precious for being hard-won. Whether or not this chilly despair is intentional or just a byproduct of the methods used to make it isn't clear; Norrvide <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2012/11/05/new-talent-lust-for-youth-seek-redemption-and-rebirth-through-their-ostensibly-bleak-brand-of-synth-pop/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> FACT Magazine that <i>Growing Seeds</i> is ""about getting out of a depressive period and meeting new love."" Which is a little mind-bending given the album's tone. But it's the atmosphere that keeps pulling me back to it, hoping to extract another clue this time around. </p></div>"|17366.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17366-growing-seeds/|7.0|Jayson Greene

They often stick raw jams and abstract sounds between crafted tunes, and even their sharpest stuff has a loose, wandering quality. Think of it as structured chaos-- or as member Daniel Spencer (one of three siblings in the group) <a href=""http://www.cyclicdefrost.com/blog/2008/04/blank-realm-interview-by-richard-macfarlane/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained</a> in 2008, ""It's something we have control over but also kind of don't."" The results can be tedious, but more often they’re engaging, and sometimes even moving.</p>
<p>Along the way Blank Realm have also hit on some melodic gems. Last year they released an infectious, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/774-the-clean/"">Clean</a>-sounding single called <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/blank-realm/falling-down-the-stairs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Falling Down the Stairs""</a>, tightening the screws without losing their personality. <i>Go Easy </i>furthers that intriguing development, resulting in their best, most coherent album yet. Blank Realm still sound impulsive and unruly, eager to noisily color outside lines. But everything here fits together snugly, and most tracks are grounded in classic rock and post-punk, evoking the way mid-90s-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux/"">Royal Trux</a> (see <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_and_Dogs_(Royal_Trux_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cats and Dogs</a></i>) made rock sound primitive while still mining its history.</p>
<p>It's clear from the start of <i>Go Easy </i>that this is a bigger, bolder Blank Realm. Opener ""Acting Strange"" sprints from the blocks with a chunky, hardcore-ish bass line, then adds engine-rev guitars suggesting Sonic Youth soundtracking a biker flick. A slower bass at the end drifts into follower <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/blank-realm/cleaning-up-my-mess-live-on"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cleaning Up My Mess""</a>, a bluesy waltz in which Sarah Spencer's snarl hits <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Herrema"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Herrema</a> levels. That pair of tunes sets the album's template: churning rockers bled into slower swings, both dipped in guitar fuzz and punk sneer. But that sneer is more world-weary than rebellious: <i>Go Easy</i> sounds like it's been around the block a few times. All the thick atmospheres and heavy sentiments have a gravity that's stronger than mere attitude.</p>
<p>Yet despite that heft, <i>Go Easy </i>is pretty entertaining, too. Much of the album flies by in an excited rush, as the band smartly fills the stereo space with sparking, fired-up sound. Even when they dip into something farther out, as in the disembodied echo of ""The Crackle, Pt. 2"", they follow with their most enervating tune, ""Pendulum Swing"". As that track moves from simple pound into guitar pyrotechnics, it's clear Blank Realm are still chasing that sweet spot between controlling their sound and setting it free.</p>
<p>That goal becomes explicit on <i>Go Easy</i>'s closing, slow-boogie <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/blank-realm/go-easy-live-on-wfmu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>. ""I was smoking in the passenger's seat/ I was listening to the radio,"" the Spencers hum wistfully over big, dusty riffs. ""They don't ever play the songs I like/ So I learn to just let it go."" That simple scene could actually be a Blank Realm manifesto-- except on <i>Go Easy</i>, the songs they like and the ones they let go turn out to be the same thing.</p></div>"|17403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17403-go-easy/|7.3|Marc Masters

While Beck and White look backwards and, er, upwards for novel distribution models-- releasing new tunes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47436-beck-announces-details-of-his-song-reader/"">as sheet music</a> and launching a single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45993-jack-white-releases-new-song-via-balloons/"">via helium balloon</a>-- Reznor, as always, looks toward the future. Last month he dropped a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48220-trent-reznor-partners-with-beats-by-dre/"">mysterious announcement</a> about hooking up with Jimmy Iovine and Beats by Dre (itself the product of another 1990s musical genius-gone-boardroom) for some sort of collaboration that sounds like it will dominate more than a few news cycles for tech and industry wonks. After recently dropping <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/trent-reznor-nine-inch-nails-working-on-new-music-possible-tour-20121107"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tantalizing hints</a> about what his fans really want: the first new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"" target=""_blank"">Nine Inch Nails</a> material since 2008's (still very good) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11503-the-slip/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Slip</i></a>, he's releasing another EP from his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28841-how-to-destroy-angels/"" target=""_blank"">How to destroy angels_</a> project that sounded so promising <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14340-how-to-destroy-angels/"">almost two and a half years ago</a>. Remember that?</p>
<p>On their six-track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48516-stream-how-to-destroy-angels_-an-omen-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>An omen_</i> EP</a>, Htda-- still comprising Reznor, singer Mariqueen Maandig, musical collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30173-atticus-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Atticus Ross</a>, and graphic designer Rob Sheridan-- show a different side of themselves. Unlike the (easily superior) self-titled EP, there aren't any out-and-out industrial bangers like ""Parasite"", nor any pop-leaning single material like ""Fur Lined"" and ""A Drowning."" Instead, there are tracks like the brooding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48428-watch-trent-reznors-how-to-destroy-angels_-perform-keep-it-together-in-the-studio/"" target=""_blank"">""Keep It Together""</a>, where Reznor joins (his wife) Maandig on a vocal that scarcely rises above a whisper. If the group's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14340-how-to-destroy-angels/"" target=""_blank"">2010 EP</a> sounded more like Reznor was still influenced by <i>The Slip</i>, <i>omen_</i> is driven by atmosphere and texture, feeling at times like an offshoot of Reznor and Ross' soundtrack work, and at others a bit like Reznor's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11289-ghosts-i-iv/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ghost</i></a> project. On ""The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters"" (titled after <a href=""http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_18.64.43.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Goya's etching</a> of the artist being dream-tortured by his worst impulses), Maandig simply murmurs melismatic vocables over a minimal electronic track that gradually progresses from the somnolent stupor of early slumber into the unpredictable menace of dreams.</p>
<p>The tracks themselves are, per Reznor and Ross's pedigrees, immaculately pieced together, richly detailed and suitably moody. Maandig, however, continues to stick out of this mix. As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14340-how-to-destroy-angels/"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Perpetua politely noted</a> in his review of the prior EP, the L.A. based singer (formerly of the group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10927-4th-wall/"">West Indian Girl</a>) is ""somewhat lacking in character."" Two years later, not much has changed: she still hits all the right notes, but brings a generic prettiness to her delivery that doesn't gel with the moody futurism going on around her. When she's showcased, then, the album's most striking and unique track-- the 7 minute ""Ice Age""-- becomes <i>omen_</i>'s least successful execution. Reznor's close-miked steampunk banjo track easily overpowers Maandig's wispy ""take me away""-style vocal. Apart from this (very long) moment, however, the <i>omen_</i> tracks could combine with the first EP into a fairly awesome hour-long album, which we're perhaps going to see next year (the band has a yet untitled LP due in 2013). But when presented on their own-- particularly in a year with very good albums in a similar vein from acts like Purity Ring, Liars, and Bat for Lashes-- they feel a bit slight.</p></div>"|17297.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17297-an-omen-ep/|6.5|Eric Harvey

That number feels, at least at first glance, surprisingly slight. Maybe that's because of the band's propensity for immersive and intricate tracks, which made each of those records feel like a new gauntlet or seminar that was to be endured and dissected, pondered and analyzed. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4135-oceanic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Oceanic</i></a>, the band's conspicuous and conscious turn toward grandeur in 2002, didn't lend itself to one or two background listens, like some pugnacious pop-punk or death metal platter; rewards came with repeated plays. At least for listeners, the Isis album cycle tended to be, like the material itself, protracted. That LP count also seems slim because the actual volume of Isis' output until the band's end in 2010 was extremely high: Between splits and remixes, collaborations and side-projects, live albums and singles, Isis released an intimidating amount of music, even if it wasn't confined to typical album formats. </p>
<p>Both Isis' ponderous tracks and prolific nature are central aspects of <i>Temporal</i>, a 2xCD and DVD (or 3xLP and DVD) package that combines a handful of heretofore unreleased rehearsal and alternate takes with songs that the band routed to those limited-edition releases instead of proper records. That's actually the taxonomy the material follows: disc one contains six demos (five of which are for songs on proper Isis albums), while disc two gathers seven remixes, covers, interludes, and split sides ahead of a toothless (but unreleased) acoustic version of one of their anthems. The DVD serves as a sort of truncated greatest hits collection, repackaging three widely released music videos with two new ones. Aside from the songs and film, <i>Temporal</i> is a decidedly minimalist set, especially for a band that never seemed to fear brazen proclamations: The liner notes are cursory, giving credit to engineers and producers and labels along the way but offering little context apart from initial recording dates.  </p>
<p>The most and least notable tracks on <i>Temporal</i> close its two respective discs: Recorded in 2001 before the band made its move from Massachusetts to Los Angeles, ""Grey Divide"" remained stuck in resin as a demo tape until drummer Aaron Harris mixed it earlier this year for release here. It's a righteous Isis anthem, rising and winding and falling through multiple crests and troughs over its 17 minutes. Isis never pushed these lengths on an actual LP, but their commitment to slow burn and interwoven sections at this early point in their development portends the successes of the four studio albums that followed. Taken alone, and more than a decade later, it remains a solitary triumph at the sometimes-irksome crossroads of instrumental metal and post-rock. </p>
<p>But the second disc closes with an acoustic and instrumental take on ""20 Minutes/40 Years"", the jarring and dynamic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13009-wavering-radiant/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wavering Radiant</i></a> highlight. It seems intended as a bittersweet farewell, an elegy where slide-guitar miniatures and pensive bass passes serve the reflective mood. But without Turner's vocal frisson and the band's massive swings of momentum, ""20 Minutes/40 Years"" sounds mostly like a reminder of Days of the New's moment in the late 90s alt-rock sun. More saliently, it's a stinging testament to how powerful Isis could be, how urgent they could feel, especially when compared to ""Grey Divide""; counter intuitively, this soft-rock track only rubs salt in the wound of Isis' absence.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, the offerings range from ignorable to interesting: This practice-space version of ""Wills Dissolve"" sounds exactly like what it is, while similar recording conditions actually enhance this demo of ""Carry"" by making Turner scream his way from beneath the band's vortex. The second disc's mix of approaches is more rewarding: Originally released on an ingeniously designed and manufactured CD-R attached to a blood-red sawblade, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QssxY7e3qM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Isis' cover of ""Streetcleaner""</a> skips the Godflesh intro and toughens the sound considerably, bass and drums stomping through sheets of noise with maniacal force and precision. Their 1999 take on Black Sabbath's ""Hand of Doom"" is serviceable, but it effectively offers a reminder that Isis soon applied its gumption to cerebral, and not stoner, metal. Noise guy Thomas Dimuzio captures that quality on his brilliant remix of ""Holy Tears"", previously issued in 2008. Instead of circumscribing Isis' power, Dimuzio enhances it by adding instrumental layers that recreate the band's sudden surges, like monoliths in fields of little relief. It's the rare heavy metal remix that intuits the band’s ambitions and emboldens them. </p>
<p>But in the end, and in an era of download link wormholes and streaming YouTube content, <i>Temporal</i> is not an essential Isis release. Despite its three-disc bulk, it exhumes too few buried-but-necessary takes and does little to illuminate what Isis did, why they did it, and what it all means. Sure, the delivery and division of these tracks might serve as a vague heuristic for understanding the band. On disc one, they're audacious metalheads sorting through the eccentricities of their own music; on disc two, they're reverent kids covering heroes and before branching out to bend their sound into strange shapes. But that's about it. </p>
<p>Maybe it's too early for proper perspective; perhaps the two years since Isis' official end haven't allowed the band to yet understand its own import or its intrigue. Instead of offering a widescreen and thorough account of their own journey on <i>Temporal</i>, they've opted for a collection of snapshots that are, even if telling, often redundant or trivial. Even though <i>Temporal</i> presents itself as an endpoint for Isis, don't expect it to be their last summary. Isis' music always demanded concentration, framing and, most of all, time. Here's hoping that, at some point, a future set embraces those qualities-- and why they sometimes made Isis so vital.</p></div>"|17279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17279-temporal/|6.7|Grayson Currin

There I watched them perform on the occasion of a Western-themed multimedia exhibit, <a href=""http://artonair.org/exhibition/canyon-candy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Canyon Candy""</a>, which included cacti, a coyote, and audio samples of yodeling. The band, fronted by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"" target=""_blank"">Woods</a> bassist Kevin Morby alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19442-vivian-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Vivian Girls</a>' Cassie Ramone, played with a projection of the 1984 drama <i>Paris, Texas</i>, and for a portion of the set Morby wore a cowboy hat.</p>
<p>While the Babies' first record pushed lines on mortality and social anxiety through a compressed, grainy filter, <i>Hill</i> feels more open and vital. <i>The Babies</i>' warm fuzz, captured at <a href=""http://alteredzones.com/posts/832/inside-woodsist-rear-house-studios/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Woods' Rear House Studios</a>, tended to mask the album's greatest asset-- its lyrics. Proper polish from an L.A. studio has cleared that up, and they've added an array of instrumental flourishes without straining too hard for maturity. Here, the Babies bend an ear towards Jimmie Rodgers, Everly Brothers, and Lee Hazlewood, along with Southern blues and gospel (""Lord""-summoning abound). Morby can be an expert storyteller as he waxes existential and sings tales of subterranean danger, slippery romance, drunken rebels; he variously offers funny colloquialisms or cutting desolation. We're left with a dense caricature of American counterculture, in constant movement towards dreams, thrills, or vice.</p>
<p>Take the criminally infectious ""Mess Me Around"", which chronicles the dead-end aftermath of an ill-fated encounter with illusory tricksters. ""I dreamt of the hell to come, if I didn't wake up and run,"" Morby sings with escalating, tongue-in-cheek paranoia, his corrupted character ""swimming in a pool of blood"" while ""straining at the Texas sun."" The scenario takes the fictionalized outlaw ballad to an absurd extreme. Who knows why the roughnecks did Morby in, but by nature there's amusement to be found with pistol-pointing rebels and their disregard of mainstream morale. Similarly liberated, ""Alligator"" puts forth a loveless character with no job to pay rent; here Morby also works in what Lester Bangs called ""the Lou Reed 'I walked to the chair/ Then I sat in it' school of lyrics,"" dispassionately offering, ""Life is funny/ Life's a laugh/ Life is lonely/ It's a drag,"" celebrating the multitudes before a light-hearted turn: ""I like your hair/ How do ya do it?""</p>
<p><i>Hill</i>, then, can be unpredictably humorous. The call-and-response of ""Chase It to the Grave"" spouts a wry hillbilly line about falling in a ditch, centered on the archetypically American conquest of achieving one's dream. Conversely, the spooked and angry ""Moonlight Mile""-- title culled from the road-weary 1971 Stones ballad-- chugs onward with a defeated promise of freedom, at a troubled site where the sky's limits are closed and dreams are broken. Morby's enraged narrator, a Billy the Kid-type ""soul-slinger"", is self-reliant in his pursuit of railroad escape: ""And that's the train that I'm on/ If you don't want on, then get off/ It's just who I am."" When he finally stares us down, wondering if our train's got direction-- ""What train are you traveling on? Is it lost into the dark?""-- it sounds profound.</p>
<p>Morby's just as strong a popsmith when taking on simple matters; a fed-up late-night question of lust on the trotting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14399-get-lost/"" target=""_blank"">""Get Lost""</a>, or ""On My Teams""s lovelorn yearning. But Ramone's easy ""baby baby"" rhymes pale in comparison to the lyrical ambition found across the record, as does the lackadaisical ""See the Country"", which tries at making a poem of the majestic American landscape. And while Morby's acoustic ""Mean"" gets at the universal feeling of wanting the annoying kid at the party to shut the fuck up-- individualism needs skepticism-- it's too precious.</p>
<p>Other tracks in straight singer-songwriter mode are easy highlights. ""Wandering"" reflects on leaving home and the romantic notion of being born anew-- America's primary fantasy-- with a lonely stillness that treads passion and tension. Morby stretches out the song's epiphany-- ""Become-- <i>what</i>? Become-- <i>what</i>? Become who you are""; it's an especially apt <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdIlsTpf5wM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">topic for 2012</a>, as internet culture insists on connections to the burdensome past and hinders self-reinvention. Meanwhile ""That Boy"" is a harrowing strummer in the form of a traditional blues ballad, with piercing inner demons: ""My best friend died/ Don't you see?/ His mother came and lied down next to me."" The verse, overpowering and raw, leads into some terrifyingly human poetry: ""Sometimes I get so scared that I can't breathe/ And the ground moves right out from beneath my feet/ And the sky's hanging low to the trees."" It's not hard to see why.</p>
<p>Since forming in 2008, the Babies have had a trying time escaping the context of Vivian Girls, Woods, and the questions of ""lo-fi"" those groups still curiously carry. But songs like ""That Boy"" offer a more illuminating origin story; Babies were born following the death of a <a href=""http://boomkat.com/vinyl/277616-bossy-the-best-of-bossy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mutual bandmate</a> and <a href=""http://kevinmorby.tumblr.com/post/12361634220/jamie-died-3-years-ago-today-on-november-5th"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">friend</a>. The backstory appears between the sunshine ripchords of their debut ""Meet Me in the City"" single, cutting its New York romanticism with funereal descriptions of ""a church cross town,"" hospital walls, shitty feelings. These songs emphasize the band's emotional capabilities. Though imperfect, <i>Hill</i>'s intensifying sonic clarity presents the Babies as a group that still believes in rock'n'roll as a powerful language, one that can help sort out mortal complexities and say something about the way we live.</p></div>"|17296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17296-our-house-on-the-hill/|7.8|Jenn Pelly

It is categorically impossible. The man with the broken-glass screech will always have a spot in our ears, if only for his inextinguishable white-hot ferocity. Life-or-death urgency is Freeway's stock in trade: he hurls every word at you like a man who's just arrived on foot from a murder scene. Anyone who treats his craft this deadly seriously cannot and will never truly suck, ever.</p>
<p>However, ever since detaching for good from the Roc-A-Fella roster, Freeway has been slamming up against a different wall: Steadily diminishing returns. He's been a free-spraying firehouse in search of a burning building, a town crier with no square. His talent is the kind that needs traction and guidance to reach any sort of target, and while Free has admirably maintained his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13930-the-stimulus-package/"">intensity</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12633-month-of-madness/"">productivity</a> through shifting, uncertain years, it's hard not to feel that the context around him has slowly leaked away. Under <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z</a>'s wing, as a studio instrument wielded by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7025-just-blaze/"" target=""_blank"">Just Blaze</a>, Freeway was unstoppable, a force of nature. On <i>Diamond in the Ruff</i>, he sounds more than ever like he’s the ultimate good soldier, one desperately in need of a general.</p>
<p>Freeway <i>sounds</i> good here. He always sounds good. His feel for tension is unparalleled. He's internalized Pac's ability to make every verse feel like a hail of body blows, switching up his flows constantly and pouncing hard on syllables you can never anticipate. He has picked a sterling row of soul-rap instrumentals to rap over. But all of this praise doubles as diagnosis; nothing has changed in Free's attack for years, and it's starting to lose its impact. Deja-vu is setting in: ""Dream Big"" is a tepidly jazzy reworking of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YYqf7bgbXc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Still Got Love""</span></a>, which would be bad enough, but album closer ""Lil' Mama"" is built on a near-identical loop. ""Greatness"" feels suspiciously close to ""Throw Your Hands Up"" from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13930-the-stimulus-package/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Stimulus Package</i></a>. He's repeating himself, and more blatantly than usual.</p>
<p>There are a few moments here that reach outside of Free's well-worn soul-rap groove. One is ""Wonder Tape"", which suggests an indie-rap recasting of the smeary-headlight melancholy of ""I'm on One"". There's ""No Doubt"", which strands a single hiccuping vocal sample over a cavern of empty space. And there’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpjNzC1-xLs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""True""</span></a><span>, which feels closer to trance-rap than anything Free's done since </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpjNzC1-xLs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""Lights Get Low""</span></a><span>, his duet with pre-greatness <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>. They are the brightest spots on the album by virtue of suggesting there might still be unexplored stylistic avenues for Freeway.</span></p>
<p>More upsetting, there are lyrics issues as well. Free's always been a cadence-first, words-later rapper; even his most immortal lines are more memorable for their delivery than what they contain. But on <i>Diamond</i>, his rhyme patterns mangle his sense so often it grows distracting: ""Even the Grim Reaper is only job doing,"" he growls on ""Right Back"". ""Flow raw as vagina with penis entering,"" he says on ""The Thirst"". That second lyric points to a second distressing problem-- an abundance of corny, half-baked lines, like  ""I'm the last Flow bender like Ang"" (""All the Hoods""); ""Vegetarian, I go in with the lettuce"" (""Money is My Medicine""); or ""She just played karaoke on my pokey"" (""Early""), which just felt so embarrassing to type that I simply cannot imagine how it feels to shout it.</p>
<p>Ever adapable, Freeway has been positioning himself, post-major label fallout as a ""real hip-hop,"" reliable alternative to the mainstream kind of guy. It makes sense as a career move, but <i>Diamond</i> sees him growing a little  too comfortable in his out-of-time role: On ""Sweet Temptations"" he makes fun of rappers with ""tight slacks"" and ponders ""buy[ing] a plane ticket to Africa"" and moving back. On ""Right Back"", he drops the Abe Simpson-worthy ""Fab say he the best that ever twitted/ Well, I'm the hottest spitter that ever <span>Googled</span><span>,"" which is doubly unforgivable for not even knowing how to pronounce the word ""tweet."" None of this stuff is deal-breaking on its own. Freeway is still nowhere near close to sucking. But he's well on his way to not mattering.</span></p></div>"|17299.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17299-diamond-in-the-ruff/|5.3|Jayson Greene

While both producers are sensitive to the meditative power of repetition and decay, Actress' distillation of Detroit techno is not central to Lukid's story. On <i>Lonely at the Top</i>, Lukid's fourth and finest album to date, he has more in common with the teasing ambiguity of Dean Blunt &amp; Inga Copeland and the mood-molding of Holy Other. Dub, bass, and dancefloor pressure merge with blurry hip-hop beats, and all are spliced with sweetly naive percussion and silvery melodies that seem to blow in on a breeze.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A bag of tapes found on the street near Lukid's London home set the wheels in motion for <i>Lonely at the Top</i>. They were a catalyst, providing the samples for the funk apparition of first track, ""Bless My Heart"" on what is a largely sample-free album. One person's trash became Lukid's treasure, and the same could be said of Blair's overall approach: on <i>Lonely</i> he finds a richness in what many distance themselves from. Contemporary culture demands we medicate against sadness and undermine the potency of playfulness. It's the ground between the two that is the source of <i>Lonely</i>'s magnetism.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Of course there's that album title: a sobering truism presented with tongue firmly in cheek. But his sensitive handling of sonic texture is what best articulates his sad/playful stance, which the title track nails so delicately. Over a bed of rolling, mournful bass, a woozy synth line, and cheeky 2-step rattle loop and build to transcendent effect. On <i>Lonely</i> sorrow is a fertile opportunity and lightheartedness a vital salve.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Where Lukid's previous albums-- 2007's <i>Onandon</i>, 2008's <i>Foma</i>, and 2010's <i>Chord-- </i>took an elastic approach to techno and house structures, <i>Lonely</i> finds him blurring the lines between genres even further. This is an impressionistic album, an evocative portrait of our boundary-less times. ""Laroche"" hints at cloud rap and begs for a Main Attrakionz feature, ""This Dog Can Swim"" is a smile-inducing slab of experimental electronics, and ""The Life of the Mind"" is pure synth ambience. </p>
<p class=""p1"">A cohesive narrative is maintained throughout, however, with some tracks creating a sense of stasis and others snapping us back to the wakeful present. So ""Lonely at the Top"" is the rhythmic flowering that follows ""Manchester""'s static techno rain, while the chirpy keys of ""Snow Theme"" suggest the clarity that springs from blunt pain. Lukid is as mindful of the spaces between the tracks as within them; some offer a gentle fade into the next track, while others provide palate-cleansing silent seconds. </p>
<p class=""p2"">A human presence haunts the the album, but it's muffled and masked, the words often indecipherable. At points, shadowy figures seem to chant a spiritual soothing-- the yawning reverb of ""Tomorrow"" provides a monastic atmosphere-- while elsewhere it's as if they are calling a warning. ""Talk to Strangers"", which verges on ambient house, builds to a call and response between one of the muffled figures and a clearer, feminine voice. ""Go, go,"" she answers the sound-shapes the figure emits. And then two-thirds of the way through there's a bass drop that pounds the chest like heartbreak. Elsewhere, ""Riquelme"" channels dance floor pressure and static waves into something industrial, curiously presenting the grind of repetition and conformity as something you can find respite in. </p>
<p class=""p2"">""The Life of the Mind"" is the quiet heart of the record, envisioning the no-man's-land of humanity's eternal internal battle: the pendulum swing between self-importance and insignificance, and the eventual, inescapable fade to gray. In some ways, <i>Lonely</i> feels like the first record Lukid has made without a safety net: He's no longer hiding in clever loops or layering. This sensual album suggests a producer at the height of his powers.</p></div>"|17217.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17217-lonely-at-the-top/|8.0|Ruth Saxelby

The box set includes a fold-it-yourself paper star ornament. And stickers. Also: temporary tattoos and a poster. There's an 80-page booklet, too. All of which may make you think: ""Wow, Sufjan is really, really, <i>really</i> fucking obsessed with Christmas."" And you would be correct. But his fixation isn't born of pure peppermint joy or the eternal spite of not finding that Power Wheels under the tree as a toddler. It's more complicated than that. About a third of the tracks here are Sufjan originals, and the music ranges from reverent, to intergalactic, to angelic, to positively looney. The stickers and tattoos include a skeleton/soldier throwing a bomb, a panda in a Christmas sweater holding a human skull, and a chainsaw-wielding snowman. The crowded poster shows a half-alien/half-human breastfeeding her alien offspring, a sea monster, a robot owl, a cigarette-smoking baby with a lobster claw for a hand, and Jesus on the phone with a caption next to him that reads, ""DAD!"" And along with lyrics and chords and insanely cut-and-pasted family photos and a hard drive's worth of outre fonts, the booklet features an essay from a pastor that concludes thusly: ""Advent is ultimately about death. The end is near. You are going to die. Happy Holidays."" </p>
<p class=""p1"">The entire project is an excavation into Sufjan's conflicted Christmas heart. He also penned two essays for the booklet, and both are filled with some of the most critical seasonal tidings you're ever likely to hear. In the first, which reads like a tortured self-justification for the project itself, he observes that the yearly economy-boosting hoopla reduces us to ""that clammy, pre-pubescent Christmas wish-list spoiled brat kid of our insatiable childhood, throwing an empirical fit on Santa's lap, faced with the hard-candy facts of reality, knowing for certain we will never really get what we want for Christmas, or in life, for that matter."" And in the second, he dives deep into the history and hypocrisy of Christmas trees specifically, concluding that: ""The Christmas tree has become nothing more than a symbol of environmental bondage, illustrating all the negligent ways in which man has taken possession of the world in order to destroy it. [...] In a word, the Christmas tree is our bitch."" Um, joy to the world?</p>
<p class=""p1"">Of course, Sufjan's uniquely bizarre feelings toward all things merry is a boon for the rest of us, who naturally have the same kind of anxieties and phobias about the holidays, but lack the vast musical talent and/or OCD graphic design skills to make it really count. Because while he's extremely wary of the idea of putting a Christmas box set out just in time for the trampling Black Friday hordes, he's no less susceptible to wintertime whimsy than anyone else. ""Christmas is what you make of it,"" he writes, in one of the more level-headed booklet passages, ""and its songs reflect mystery and magic as expertly as they clatter and clang with the most audacious and rambunctious intonations of irreverence.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Like <i>Songs for Christmas</i>, which boxed EPs recorded for friends and family each year from 2001-2006, <i>Silver &amp; Gold </i>has another five discs that span songs from 2006-2010, with some additional tune-ups laid down over the last couple of years. Essentially, it's an extremely over-the-top scrapbook, detailing the musical phases, friends, and feelings coursing through Sufjan's world each year. But unlike the meticulously pleasant <i>Songs for Christmas</i>, which more or less sounds exactly like what a casual fan (or detractor) might expect a Sufjan Stevens Christmas box set to sound like, the music inside <i>Silver &amp; Gold </i>can be as downright strange as its accompanying accessories.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Recorded with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National's</a> Dessner brothers a year and a half after the release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7514-illinois/"" target=""_blank""><i>Illinois</i></a>, 2006's <i>Gloria</i> is the most traditionally Sufjan-y thing here. With its careful guitar picking, pristine choir, and overall sense of in-the-lines tastefulness, it's the disc least likely to offend grandmothers on Christmas Day. <i>Gloria</i> also has two of the collection's finest originals with <a href=""http://music.sufjan.com/track/the-midnight-clear-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Midnight Clear""</a> and <a href=""http://music.sufjan.com/track/carol-of-st-benjamin-the-bearded-one-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Carol of St. Benjamin the Bearded One""</a>, both of which could sneak onto <i>Illinois</i> without much complaint. ""I will delight in this,"" sings Sufjan, sincerely backing up his own faith, before a choir quietly comes back, ""Though you may doubt it."" </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>I Am Santa's Helper</i> is the wooliest of the bunch, and also the worst. It's got the most tracks at 23, but many are just two-minute fragments, bits of solo piano, or goofball jamming. It still lasts 45 minutes, and by the mid-way point, Sufjan and his buddies' ramshackle racket goes from endearing to annoying. It was recorded right around the premiere of his ambitious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13593-the-bqe/"" target=""_blank""><i>BQE</i></a> project, which could explain the tossed-off-ness. Still, it's instructive of this songwriter's musical narrative; it sounds lost, searching for something new and settling on something half-baked.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Christmas Infinity Voyage</i> is where things get interesting. These songs were originally recorded at the end of 2008, a relatively quiet time for Sufjan, and they reveal an artist in transition. A version of this disc made it online that Christmas, showing Sufjan toying with new electronic textures. That leaked release was intriguing, but ultimately unsure (Sufjan himself calls it ""poorly realized"" in the <i>Silver &amp; Gold</i> booklet). So he took the same songs and largely re-recorded them over the last two years, using the technical know-how he built up while working on 2010's radical and brilliant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14738-the-age-of-adz/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Age of Adz</i></a>. So, of all the material here, <i>Infinity Voyage</i> comes closest to that album's mechanized sheen. There's a roboticized <a href=""http://music.sufjan.com/track/do-you-hear-what-i-hear-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Do You Hear What I Hear?""</a> that lasts nearly 10 minutes, eventually spiraling gloriously out of control with Sufjan repeating ""do you feel what I feel?"" with enough vocal processing slathered over his voice to make T-Pain blush. There's a brief and bubbly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48540-listen-sufjan-stevens-covers-prince/"" target=""_blank"">cover of Prince's ""Alphabet St.""</a> that recalls Beck's white-boy funk circa <i>Midnite Vultures</i>-- it makes little sense within the context of a Christmas album, but only a fool would protest. This is the disc most likely to confuse the hell out of your grandmother.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Infinity Voyage </i>also boasts the set's strongest originals. <a href=""http://music.sufjan.com/track/christmas-in-the-room-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Christmas in the Room""</a> is <i>Silver &amp; Gold</i>'s best bet at some sort of bizarro new standard, as it combines Sufjan's old-school acoustic balladry with some subtle new-school electronics. It's about finding Christmas-- and all its joy and sorrow-- in another person: ""No travel plans, no shopping malls/ No candy canes or Santa Claus/ For as the day of rest draws near/ It's just the two of us this year."" Meanwhile, <a href=""http://music.sufjan.com/track/the-child-with-the-star-on-his-head-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Child With the Star on His Head""</a> uses the birth of Christ to try to transcend the little things that make up modern human existence, things like ""dictionaries,"" ""calendars,"" ""television,"" ""fathers,"" and ""consequences."" But those pillars can't really be looked past, and Sufjan knows this. So he stops singing for the final 10 minutes of the quarter-hour track, and instead lets a stream-of-consciousness experimental guitar/synth/who-knows-what solos do the heavy lifting. Somehow, these cracked sounds do the job, rendering a smashed beauty that's almost impossible to translate with words. Here, Sufjan is no longer lost, and it's all too easy to get blissfully disoriented by the cacophony.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">The final two discs, <i>Let It Snow</i> and <i>Christmas Unicorn</i>, ride out the momentum of <i>Infinity Voyage</i>, though they're not quite as out-there. Both find Sufjan continuing to experiment with synthetic sounds, though mostly as accents rather than the focus. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48569-watch-sufjan-stevens-creepy-ill-be-home-for-christmas-video/"" target=""_blank"">""I'll Be Home for Christmas"" </a>gets an especially dreamy revamp, with Sufjan sounding like a quivering ghost looking down on the season's festivities. And <a href=""http://music.sufjan.com/track/let-it-snow-let-it-snow-let-it-snow-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!""</a> is given a minor-chord makeover, ultimately hinting at what a Radiohead Christmas album might sound like. The entire marathon ends strong with a couple of moody ruminators-- <a href=""http://music.sufjan.com/track/happy-karma-christmas-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Happy Karma Christmas""</a> and <a href=""http://music.sufjan.com/track/justice-delivers-its-death"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Justice Delivers Its Death""</a>-- and a blowout finale with the 13-minute <a href=""http://music.sufjan.com/track/christmas-unicorn"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Christmas Unicorn""</a>. Turns out Sufjan-- with his highly weary yet hopelessly complicit take on the holidays-- is the unicorn, and he suspects he's not alone. ""I know you're just like me,"" he sings, before pied-piper flutes lead us to an electro freak-out that perfectly morphs into ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"". Within this latest mistletoe'n'holly universe Sufjan has created, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a> classic makes exactly as much sense as ""We Need a Little Christmas""; the Christmas spirit is a fractured one, and reveling in its inherent contradictions is the only way to get through it with your soul intact.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In the <i>Silver &amp; Gold</i> essay by Pastor Thomas Vito Aiuto, he explains how the birth of Christ and Christianity helped to transfer humanity's overall narrative from cyclical to linear. That is, whereas time was an ""empty medium"" before, Christianity brought with it ideas of a great birth and a great death-- the apocalypse. It's intense stuff, but it's also transferable to today's Christmas which, for a 37-year-old like Sufjan or anyone who suddenly finds themselves giving more gifts than they receive, can be about ends: of innocence, of youth, of blind joy. But still, with his annual winter music-making ritual and his refusal to totally give into the more cynical aspects of the holidays-- he decided to release all of his originals here as Public Domain-- Sufjan is taking things back to the days of cycles, in a way. His songwriting no longer hews to story-like structures; he's more and more prone to extended outros that find musical answers through repetition. Talking about the Greco-Roman world, Aiuto writes, ""Abstraction was for them the vehicle of truth and salvation."" One listen to the frenzied and free final minutes of ""The Child With the Star on His Head"", and it's clear-- Sufjan sounds closer to that gospel than ever.</p></div>"|17320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17320-silver-gold-songs-for-christmas/|7.8|Ryan Dombal

<p>So maybe there's no ""basic"" Oneida sound, and if so, that's part of what's made them such an interesting and unpredictable band. Their sonic shape-shifting continues on this vinyl-only offering,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47613-oneida-announce-new-lp-share-album-sampler/"" target=""_blank""> <i>A List of the Burning Mountains</i></a>. But compared to its conceptual predecessors, the album feels simple and frill-free. It consists of two side-long tracks, both sharing a name with the album. And it sounds uncalculated and uncontrived, as if Oneida's just playing whatever they feel like playing at the moment. The result is high-level improvised rock, infused with the assurance and proficiency that comes from 15 years of making so much varied music.</p>
<p>It's also infused with the expert drumming of Kid Millions, who this time out sounds like the band's unofficial leader. My guess is that every member had an equal, unspoken say in how this jam evolved, but Millions' busy beats are like wind blowing Oneida's clouds of noise and drone. When his playing is weighty and grounded, full of kick-drum drilling, his comrades dole out denser sounds; when his beats are more regular, the mix swerves toward rock riffs; and when he gets airier and more impulsive, the guitars lighten and the atmosphere expands. The band fuses these sections seamlessly; you don't really notice that they've made a shift until long after that shift actually began.</p>
<p>The peaks on <i>A List of the Burning Mountains </i>come when Oneida connects the dots so deftly that the differences between their individual contributions is nearly unnoticeable. My favorite instance comes about halfway through side two, when grinding feedback, swaths of electronic drone, and a churning low end all melt into one undulating ocean. Similar passages occur throughout-- take a dark section during side one that evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a>-style drone-metal, or the album's close, a free jazz sprint morphed into the echo of a symphony. But I have to admit I had to scan back through to remember those sections, because there's a unity to this album that's bigger and more indefinable than what individual moments can capture.</p>
<p>The impression I keep coming back to is how basic <i>A List of the Burning Mountains </i>is. As big and bold as it can sound, there's little here that's especially flashy or blatantly attention-seeking. The band never really gets into any obvious repetitions or motifs, content to run where they want to run and drift where they want to drift. Paradoxically, this understated approach means the album might be best appreciated by those most familiar with the band's specific internal language. But I can't imagine anyone checking out <i>A List of the Burning Mountains</i> and coming away unimpressed.</p></div>"|17304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17304-a-list-of-the-burning-mountains/|7.2|Marc Masters

For singer/lyricist Alejandra Deheza, ghosts represent the very real emotions that arise from deeply personal past events-- particularly those that aren't blessed with a sense of closure-- and which manifest themselves bodily as stress, or a general sense of unease. Not anything near the leap forward that 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14453-disconnect-from-desire/"" target=""_blank""><i>Disconnect from Desire</i></a>, was from 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12399-alpinisms/"" target=""_blank""><i>Alpinisms</i></a>, <i>Ghostory</i> was more Deheza and Ben Curtis doubling down on the group's foundational conceit: a meditative confrontation with the shackles of guilt-- what Depeche Mode called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k82MVc5cAso"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""a halo in reverse.""</a></p>
<p>From its title alone, it's tempting to view the 5 track tour EP <i>Put Your Sad Down</i> as a too-literal evocation of <i>Ghostory</i>'s conceit-- like the highly-regarded therapist going all in and aiming for the top of the self-help bestseller chart. Indeed, <i>Sad</i>'s title track is the most outlandish thing they've ever done: a nearly 13-minute excursion into <i>Miami Vice-</i>style synth thumps and the monasterial echo of <i>Violator</i>, that takes an off-ramp into a lengthy drone section halfway through before reprising the central theme. ""All I wanna do/ Is make you forget/ Forget that you feel so bad,"" Deheza chants, echoing the mystical empathy that suffuses all of SVIIB's music, but with a fervor more in line with the euphoria of disco-style escapism. When she suggests ""tonight, just feel with your body,"" however, it's less a suggestion to give in to unfettered eros than to heed a personal fulfillment mantra.</p>
<p>In essence, it's the perfect lead track for a tour EP, a release genre that typically collects castaways and one-offs as a reward to fans who come out to live dates. There are some orphans on <i>Sad</i>, though tracks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14525-secret-days/"" target=""_blank"">""Secret Days""</a> and ""Faded Heart"" merge Deheza's trademark yearning with production that respectively recall the earthy circa 2008 Brooklyn syncopations of <i>Alpinisms</i> and a more outré version of <i>Disconnect</i>'s take on 90s club music. A dream-pop update of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6251-silver-apples/"" target=""_blank"">Silver Apples'</a> hypnotic proto-electro track <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKivSa2MYzo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lovefingers""</a> would certainly stick out on the band's carefully drawn LPs, but in an interstitial context, the song affectionately traces a direct line back to one of the preeminent pioneers of SVIIB's own sound. Particularly with the departure of Deheza's twin Claudia from the group before the release of <i>Ghostory</i>, SVIIB has gone through some significant changes over the past year. Perhaps this release is their own way of dispensing with some lingering ghosts before moving on to something new.</p></div>"|17396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17396-put-your-sad-down-ep/|6.3|Eric Harvey

Or so goes the narrative: To say that this thematic arc is mostly out of dog's range of hearing, and that all three releases resemble each other more than they do not, isn't a knock on DaVinci. He is a phenomenally consistent artist, and his releases resemble each other in all the best ways.</p>
<p>Very little changes in DaVinci's style, by design. His voice is flat and dry, sounding like Yo Gotti but less raspy. He doesn't modulate his voice much, preferring to let his writing do the inflection for him. He is a resolutely serious pen-and-pad ghetto reporter, a East Coast-hearted rapper through and through. Bay Area rap has been working through an intriguing obsession with NYC's grey-toned boom-bap heyday: That music felt traditional and timeless even as it was being made, and you have to assume this is what appeals to DaVinci. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28274-freddie-gibbs/"" target=""_blank"">Freddie Gibbs</a>, who pops up on <i>The MOEna Lisa</i> and instantly feels like a kindred spirit, DaVinci treats ""gangsta music"" as something to present and then to get out of the way of. To elaborate on it, vandalize it, or make it his own would be heresy.</p>
<p>All of this makes DaVinci sound about as exciting as a bowl of shredded wheat and water. Subtlety is a murderous selling point: You might as well trumpet the font and spacing of a book. But small details, lovingly fussed over, <i>do</i> matter, and the longer you spend in DaVinci’s fine-grained world, the further you sink into it. He's an incremental-progress artist, and there's progress to observe on <i>The MOEna Lisa</i>. His taste in beats is growing more flamboyant-- those beats seem to be rubbing off on his po-faced style. ""Champion"" chops a flashy piano strut similar to ""Otis"" and tosses in a sampled gospel choir and children’s voices to boot. ""My Connect"", which loops a helium-filled vocal whine around a thunderous slap, resembles the cartoon-colored Bay Area rap of DaVinci's peers.</p>
<p>If there's anywhere you can actually feel the narrative arc DaVinci has claimed for these albums, it's in the sense that on <i>The MOEna Lisa</i><span>, he's at least momentarily let got of whatever was gnawing him internally and allowed himself a few laughs, even put a few of them on the record. He's still better writing about misery rather than fun or women: Here's a fiercely packed line from the Gibbs featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14063-myob-ft-freddie-gibbs/"" target=""_blank"">""MYOB""</a>: ""Big brother shot up, sister's always knocked up/ Big homey's locked up and my poppa still ain't popped up."" On ""Extraordinary"", by contrast, he offers the profoundly uninviting sex talk ""I'm gonna renovate the coochie/ rip down walls,"" which is so disgusting that it took me out of the song to ponder questions: Will there be ventilation masks? Asbestos testing? (And, for what it's worth, most women probably don't enjoy having their vaginas compared to condemned buildings.)<br/></span></p>
<p><span>You can hear the flip side of forehead-slappers like that, though, on songs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14500-nothin-finna-stop-me/"" target=""_blank"">""Nothin Finna Stop Me""</a>, which is full of goofy similes and boasting-- his money comes quick ""like virgin sex,"" if he ""had a bag full of fucks I couldn't give one."" The song is </span><span>relaxed</span><span>, something DaVinci's never once been, and for fans of his music, it is all the more satisfying for feeling hard-won. This sense of stakes, impossible to quantify or explain, is what compels you to stick around with DaVinci. It's there in the music, and it's a worthy substitute for flair or formal innovation. He doesn't tweak gangsta rap because it probably helped save his life, and he likes it straight. On </span><i>The MOEna Lisa</i><span> it remains as lovingly served as you can get it anywhere these days.</span></p></div>"|17201.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17201-the-moena-lisa/|7.1|Jayson Greene

This made sense in 2007 when he was releasing early <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/italtek"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ital Tek</a> singles like ""Blood Line"", a track that had more of an aggressive horror-movie-soundtrack atmosphere than most dubstep of the time, but still fit the general outlines of the form. These days, though, it's an inaccurate, not to mention unimaginative, way to describe an artist who over course of an armful of releases the past five years has become impressively adept at shrugging off the constraints of genre identification.</p>
<p><span>Myson's stylistic slipperiness has reached a peak on his third full-length, <i>Nebula Dance</i>. He bends his sonic profile to fit enough disparate subgenres for the record to resemble a respectably broad survey of the dance music world circa 2012, or at least the parts that appeal to its more cerebral, less hedonistic citizens. You get a drum'n'bass cut here, a dip into footwork there, all with little to no indication of party-hard moombahton and trap.</span></p>
<p>It's to Myson's credit that he never comes off like a dilettante in the process. For one he seems to runderstand the source material he's working from. Not only can he grasp what makes a footwork beat read as a footwork beat, but he gets what it is about footwork beats that makes people want to listen to them in the first place. And maybe more significantly, he isn't afraid to mess with the forms he's exploring, which makes the whole project seem like a musician at play in a stylistic sandbox rather than one dissecting them with clinical detachment, a mood that's sunk more than a few artists' attempts to jump genre barriers.</p>
<p>For instance the titular opening cut, with its 142 BPM tempo and deep sub-bass dives, is obviously intended to be Myson's take on drum'n'bass. But the beat steers clear of obvious references to the ""Amen"" break that underpinned the vast majority of first wave d'n'b, replacing it with intricately plotted drum programming full of backwards samples that give it the feeling of a rhythm coiling around itself. When the song takes a breath halfway through and introduces a hint of hip-hop, it starts to sound a little like 2step and a little like the chilly dubstep Myson made his name on-- in other words a couple of nods toward drum'n'bass' descendents, which might come off as a little too clever if it didn't progress so organically.</p>
<p>His handling of footwork music-- whose influence is most clearly felt on ""Dusk Beat"", but which permeates a good chunk of the record-- is equally deft. Up until this point, most attempts by musicians from outside the original Chicago scene to emulate the style have been sunk by an overly exacting approach to reproducing the sounds of producers like DJ Rashad and DJ Spinn (both labelmates of Myson's on Planet Mu), combined with the serious hurdle of not having access to actual footwork dancers (whose highly specific demands have been the biggest influence on the form). Purists might take issue with Myson softening the style's edges and aiming it more toward the boutique headphones crowd than dancers working on their dribbles, skates, and ghosts, but the airy, R&amp;B-tinged feel he brings to a sound that can be oppressively claustrophobic is crafty. And more importantly it simply works.</p>
<p>For all of the stylistic hopscotch being played, the individual songs on <i>Nebula Dance</i> cohere into an impressively solid whole. During his time as Ital Tek, Myson has developed a sonic identity that's proven more than capable of whatever formal experiments he uses it for. The difficulty listeners might have figuring out where to shelve it is a small price to pay for the results.</p></div>"|17353.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17353-nebula-dance/|7.8|Miles Raymer

But there's one catch: If you <i>weren't</i> checked out completely during 2011, you've already heard the vast majority of <i>Trilogy</i>, for free. So it's understandable if you're wondering why this set, which collects <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a>'s three 2011 mixtapes in one package and adds three additional songs, exists in the first place. But presentation matters to the Weeknd. This is evident in the project's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12131-what-you-need/"">early anonymity</a>, the unified typography, the striking <a href=""http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/incoming/15762/06e19b0c.jpg"">photographs</a>, the ambitious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/more/?query=weeknd&amp;filter=music_videos"">videos</a> and, most important, the fact that Tesfaye called his three releases of 2011 a trilogy. It's not unprecedented for someone to put out three albums in a year, but Trilogy suggests an ambitious and rigorously planned Work of Art.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While the previously available versions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15264-house-of-balloons/""><i>House of Balloons</i></a>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15754-thursday/"">Thursday</a>, </i>and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16134-echoes-of-silence/"">Echoes of Silence</a> </i>already felt definitive, a three-hour immersion provides a new way in, assuming you are willing to take it as a single piece. Which isn't easy: in spite of Tesfaye's diaphanous voice and the lush production, these are <i>heavy </i>records, with tempos that slow to a codeine drip for five minutes or more. But <i>Trilogy </i>as a whole sets up a narrative that was previously only implied. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>House of Balloon</i>s is the ""fun"" part of the story,<i> </i>though that's a relative term. It has the only Weeknd songs you might play at a celebration, and the only point <i></i>where the illicit behavior feels alluring. On <i>House</i>, the Weeknd introduce an aesthetic that, over the course of the rest of the three tapes, gradually evolves into something deeper and less based in traditional songcraft. It's a continuation of the purple-tinted R&amp;B and hip-hop hybrid forged by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"">The-Dream</a> and Drake, with eye-of-the-quiet storm assurance of <a href=""http://www.sade.com/us/home/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sade</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10601-aaliyah/"">Aaliyah</a> and industrial and trip-hop touches that range from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"">Nine Inch Nails</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4285-tricky/"">Tricky</a>. But the Weeknd show a flair for melody that allows every richly atmospheric song on <i>House </i>to stand on its own, boasting strong (and sometimes borrowed) hooks that embrace repetition without feeling manipulative. The cyclical choruses of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12131-what-you-need/"" target=""_blank"">""What You Need""</a>, ""The Morning"", and ""High For This"" in particular are both immediately striking and subtly ingratiating, overtures to pop radio that operate outside of it.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Those borrowed hooks mean that <i>House of Balloons </i>is the part of <i>Trilogy </i>most affected by the remaster. If you can't catch how the guitars hit a little harder and the drums have a bit more pop on ""High For This"", you'll <i>definitely </i>notice how the sample from Aaliyah's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5AAcgtMjUI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rock the Boat</a>"" has been wiped from ""What You Need"". If I had to choose, I prefer the original <i>House of Balloons </i>for its spontaneity, but it's kind of like familiarizing yourself with your partner after they get a new haircut; it's just <i>different </i>for a while, and if you want, you can always go back.<i> </i></p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Thursday </i>is exactly the kind of ""difficult"" second record you'd expect from the Weeknd had they disappeared for two years and holed up in the studio as a reaction to <i>House</i>'s success. But it came just a few months after. It's more ambitious in its way, incorporating influences far from the R&amp;B mainstream and generally just sounding like it has something to prove. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The title is a loaded metaphor; Thursday is a day for the most dedicated partiers, the one that separates a lost weekend from a week full of blackouts. Accordingly, the album is an hour-long exploration of people acknowledging a point of no return. What had been seductive has become menacing. Outside of Drake's guest verse on ""The Zone"", there's not much indication that the songs<i> </i>take place in a club of any sort. The pleasure on <i>House of Balloons </i>felt consensual; here, it feels codependent. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Echoes of Silence </i>benefits considerably from the <i>Trilogy</i> context and now seems on equal footing with <i>House of Balloons </i>and <i>Thursday. </i>As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"">Juicy J</a> helpfully reminds us out of nowhere at the end of ""Same Old Song"", <i>Echoes </i>was released near Christmas, a refractory period between the publication of year-end lists and the turn of the calendar. It's easy to overlook new music that drops at that point, especially in this case, where the lack of immediate hooks suggests that it could have been a rush job. </p>
<p class=""p1"">But get familiar with <i>Echoes</i>' aims and you can hear its value. For one, the lyrical and thematic callbacks make clear that <i>Echoes </i>was meant to interact with what preceded it, to serve as an epilogue and appendix in addition to a denouement. More importantly, it's easier to tune into the final third's resounding depression after having been tenderized by the preceding two hours. It's a morning-after record for a night that never ended, where people have to go into their day shift with no sleep, where club stars still live with parents and the parents find drugs in the laundry. And it's where people who only hours before were perfectly fine to snort their life away simply cannot fucking stand to be around each other for another minute.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But the arresting music redeems that potentially alienating emotional view. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12913-montreal/"" target=""_blank"">""Montreal""</a> boasts a frigid and concise hurt as well as a pop sensibility that went missing from the previous half hour, ""Outside"" incorporates intriguing Eastern overtones, and ""The Fall"" integrates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"">Clams Casino</a>'s brand of beautifully wasted hip-hop, which ascended in parallel to the Weeknd throughout 2011. </p>
<p>On <i>House</i>'s ""The Party and the After Party,"" Tefsaye sings, ""They don't want my love/ They just want my potential."" In the context of <i>Trilogy</i>'s progression, it's the first crack in his callous exterior, revealing a lifelong studio nerd with possibly years worth of grudges (""I don't play/ Unless it's keys and I play all day,"" he claims on ""Loft Music""). He makes repeated mentions of ""potential,"" and being ""next,"" fixating on those particular words like he's holding onto something a girl told him in 7th grade. If you turn your ear right, <i>Trilogy</i> is the most in-depth exploration of male sexual neuroses this side of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14817-pinkerton-deluxe-edition-death-to-false-metal/""><i>Pinkerton</i></a>.</p>
<p>""You never thought I'd go this far,"" Tesfaye sings on ""Same Old Song"". That line could be a reference to marathon drug use or the progressive demoralization of his narrator, which bottoms out amidst the pall of gang rape coursing through the very uncomfortable ""Initiation"". The inclusion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a>'s venomous ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUi_S6YWjZw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Diana</a>"" on <i>Echoes</i> (renamed ""D.D."") is perfect in this context, retaining the original's deplorable depiction of predatory groupies as the feminine norm. Tesfaye's narrator celebrates his own irresistibility and embraces the poisonous justifications of victimhood.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Just as perfect is the closing title track, which finds Tesfaye alone in a quiet room, letting the past reverberate, hitting bottom because he simply stops digging. It's the point where the Weeknd's 2011 stops and it's a perfect way to end things. At least it <i>was</i>; on <i>Trilogy, </i>it's followed by ""Till Dawn (Here Comes The Sun)"". Like all of the new songs, it's strong enough on its own but arbitrary in terms of sequencing and has only minimal relation to the LP it was included on.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is some of the best music of the young decade; judging by its already pervasive influence, it's safe to say <i>Trilogy </i>(or at least <i>House of Balloons</i>) will be one of those records that will be viewed as a turning point when we look at the 2010s as a whole. Some of it's up to demographics. Artists of Tesfaye's age had formative years where Timbaland, the Neptunes, Missy Elliott, D'Angelo, and Aaliyah were at the peak of their powers. And given the ""new rock revolution"" early in the 2000's, which created nothing new at all, it stands to reason that many who came of age in that era don't hear rock as a progressive form. You can sense the shift when talking to new bands. And of course, for those who have some indie rock inclinations, Beach House and Siouxsie samples don't hurt. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Ultimately, the Weeknd's music creates a world. In it, people acknowledge their humanity as expressed by their desires to fuck, to get high, to resent one another, to hurt, to not care about tomorrow. That's a lot for a single artist to take on. ""You'll wanna be high for this,"" Tesfaye memorably sings within the first minute. <i>Trilogy</i>'s triumph is in how it makes its three hours feel necessary to fully embrace it all, to acknowledge its existence inside ourselves and to vicariously live through it as art.</p></div>"|17280.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17280-the-trilogy/|8.5|Ian Cohen

His output includes not only studio albums under his own name and the still active <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Kil Moon</a> moniker, but also various collections of live tracks, alternate takes, rarities, and covers. Most find their way to listeners via bonus discs or free-with-purchase offerings, and by now seemingly every song he has ever written is well documented at each stage of its life: rough demo, studio recording, and live performance. And yet, despite releasing only a handful of proper albums, Kozelek's archives are apparently inexhaustible. It appears to be a sound business model, one that plays to the demands of his small but cultish fanbase that will happily parse the differences between various versions of deep-album cuts.</p>
<p>This 2xCD soundtrack to Kozelek's documentary, <i>On Tour</i>, serves as a kind of label sampler, a retrospective of Caldo Verde's ancillary releases. Several of these 33 songs are culled from previous collections, including 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14430-admiral-fell-promises/"">Admiral Fell Promises</a></i>, 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13015-lost-verses-live/"">Lost Verses Live</a></i>, and 2006's <i>Little Drummer Boy Live</i>. Additionally, everything here-- save a few noodly sketches like ""Seville Piece"" and ""Backstage Unitarian Piece""-- has been available in some form or another before now. That includes the four bonus tracks and even ""Koko"", a typically atmospheric instrumental by Caldo Verde signees <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=desertshore"">Desertshore</a>. As though that wasn't enough, early orders will include a bonus disc, <i>Live in Copenhagen.</i></p>
<p>This busy release schedule arguably serves a function beyond simply generating product and profit: It allows Kozelek to insist that a song changes essentially from one night to the next and that such external factors as location, venue, and audience define a song as fundamentally as lyrics and melody. In that regard, there is new material on <i>On Tour</i>, even if the tracklist overlaps with every other Kozelek release. And yet, the set comes across as quietly and curiously anticlimactic, if only because he has hit this retrospective vein so many times in the past. However, we've never actually heard Kozelek do a soundtrack before. This might present some artists an opportunity to either reconsider what they do or rethink the whole concept of what a soundtrack can do, but <i>On Tour</i> comes across as haphazard and, worse, conceptually staid.</p>
<p>There is something intrinsically cinematic about Kozelek's music, especially the material on <i>Admiral Fell Promises</i>, which was defined by the fine filigrees of guitar, the low thrum of the nylon strings, the subtle grain in his voice, and the delicate evocations of his lyrics. Some of the older material, such as ""Void (Live in Sweden)"" and ""Like the River (Live in Spain)"", are enlivened by his flamenco-style guitar playing, while others, such as ""Lucky Man (Hotel Performance)"" take on a new intimacy thanks to the relatively lo-fi quality of the recordings. It's clear Kozelek is an able, agile picker and a gracefully understated interpreter, but that's not necessarily a revelation.</p>
<p>The music is not the problem here; the problem is the way the music's been repackaged. And that includes the timing of this release. The film debuted last fall, long before Sun Kil Moon's most recent album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16674-among-the-leaves/""><i>Among the Leaves</i></a> surfaced, a collection that actually proves a much more bracing enumeration of the gains and losses of a life spent on the road, in the studio, and at the label. It's as though Kozelek threw caution to the wind and started writing about what lay immediately in front of him: overeager fanboys, VD, broken relationships, a bad back. The frankness and forthrightness with which he addressed such matters allowed for a sneaky humor rarely heard on his albums, and the considerable length of <i>Among the Leaves-- </i>17 tracks at about 70 minutes­­, plus a bonus disc, of course-- seemed to be its grimmest joke: After more than two decades in the music business, Kozelek has become the old man rambling on and on and on, to the point where fewer and fewer people are listening.<i> Among the Leaves</i>, while far from perfect, still represents a new chapter for Kozelek, one that finds him trying out new approaches and new attitudes that throw his entire catalog into sharp relief while revealing new facets of his veteran persona. He has two February releases-- a live album and a covers collection-- that ought to expound on <i>Leaves</i>. In the meantime, how can <i>On Tour</i> be anything but an enormous step backwards?</p></div>"|17365.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17365-mark-kozelek-on-tour-the-soundtrack/|6.0|Stephen M.

The most distinct and memorable voice heard on <i>Dream On, </i>meanwhile, is the one that opens ""What a Mess"": the flange-distorted pleads of a choked-up woman at a 2009 town hall meeting, asking Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn what he could do to help her uninsured husband after he suffered a traumatic brain injury. Coburn's response-- that citizens have to rely on community instead of government for help-- is multitracked and reverbed into oblivion before being smothered by a dense organ chord and crumbled apart by skittering hi-hats.</p>
<p>It's a willfully bizarre sample for a producer to slot into a postmodern house track, even one that rides on a tension between minimalism and abrasion. But it's also one of Daniel Martin-McCormick's clearest signals yet that he's got a certain dedication to finding the potential for repulsion in a traditionally euphoric and physical strain of music. Just how ugly <i>Dream On </i>gets is a matter of degrees-- most of it isn't as up-front as that opening to ""What a Mess"", and when it does manifest it's usually more in the form of a creeping dissonance or a slow build to something intriguingly grotesque. This album exploits the fine line between repetition as groove and repetition as unnerving tic, head music that worries the body.</p>
<p>Opening track ""Despot"" is as close as things get to the spaced-out momentum of its predecessor album's brightest moments. But even its straightforwardly dense backbeat is in the service of a pulse that feels more like tension than release, building unease with with stuttering shards of chirping monosyllabic vocals and directionless melodies that pace around looking over their shoulders instead of cresting. ""Boi"" has a similar creep to oblivion, opening on a stark wave of congealing lava-flow synth ooze before the groove clicks into place. The pairing of fragmented vocal loops (a churn that gradually emerges as the phrase ""baby boy""), tight-packed clap-snare-throb percussion, and subtle, deeply submerged melodic touches sets up a lush space-- but that only makes things more disorienting when he brings in a succession of high-pitched, intermittent buzzing whirs that resemble pitched-up F1 race cars.</p>
<p>But Ital never loses the plot, even when it seems like throwing off casual dancefloor vibes is part of the point. The way ""Enrique"" starts splitting at the seams, choppy intonations of firing-up jet engine whirs crackling through the edges, only makes its three-miles-deep echo chamber feel sound less stark and emotionless than it did on the outset. And closer ""Deep Cut (Live Edit)"" makes for a bracing reprieve from the rest of the album's tension, following up the knife-edge snares, organ growls, and panic-attack layered vocals of ""What a Mess"" with a spacious deep house atmosphere that only gets more high-spirited when the noisy bits seep in-- that buzzsaw drone might as well be a chorus of angels. Ital's sense of abrasion and his notion of groove are both finely tuned, so it's all for the best when they work in parallel.</p></div>"|17298.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17298-dream-on/|7.4|Nate Patrin

The tape consisted of angry, fuck-the-world celebrations (""Huzzah!"", ""Triple F""), lugubrious slow burners (""Weight of Water"", ""I Should Be Sleepin'""), pulp pastiche (""Maltese Falcon Pt. 1 and Pt. 2"", ""Fire Marshall Bill"") and enjoyable offbeat miscellany (""Chicken Spot Rock"", ""Build-a-Bitch""), all over gritty beats. eXquire showed himself to be a pretty good rapper, with patches of out-and-out brilliance, who had a gift for writing catchy, cathartic songs, and a penchant for extreme emotional outbursts.</p>
<p>His first major label offering, the new EP <i>Power and Passion</i>, consists of a direct reiteration of that persona. It's a vulgar, dissonant listen, assisted by fantastic Def Jux-style production from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"" target=""_blank"">El-P</a> and Harry Fraud, and it's wildly inconsistent on a bar-by-bar basis. EPs shouldn't carry excess baggage, but the original, worthwhile material here exists in shards that the listener must piece together, avoiding the weak spots along the way.</p>
<p>Most of the unnecessary fat comes in the form of recycled sentiments and lines. eXquire extended a middle finger to the world in ""Triple F"", and the direct retreads on both verses of ""Cheap Whores &amp; Champagne"" and the chorus of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14535-the-message-1-and-2/"" target=""_blank"">""The Message Pt. 1 &amp; 2""</a> seem redundant. Much of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14435-telephuck-ft-gucci-mane/"" target=""_blank"">""Telephuck""</a> is just lazy, recycling no fewer than five lyrics from songs past, and not unmemorable ones at that: ""Froze, stone-cold, staring at Medusa"" was so striking on first listen that its repetition is simply irritating.</p>
<p>Then again, on the very same song, there are some incredibly deft lyrics. ""10 different me's/ y'all don't know how to cope"" is as self-aware a line as you'll find on any early Kanye album, and ""Looking back at the projects, like I'm glad I'm gone/ I left the Cavaliers and never shed a tear,"" is a subtler sports reference than any of Wale or Wayne's thousand ESPN-ready punchlines. In ""Cheap Whores and Champagne"", towards the end of the first list of people, places, and abstract ideas to which eXquire wants to extend a ""fuck you,"" comes the quick line, ""Fuck trust/ I don't trust trust/ because trust fucked me/ countless times."" It's that ""countless times"" that holds real weight; that potentially infinite number of betrayals makes it easier to imagine why eXquire is so bitter.</p>
<p>When he ignores the haters, puts in some work, and writes a full verse, eXquire hangs onto his capacity to impress. On ""CAri ZALloni"", a dense, hypnotic beat by Dot Da Genius backlights a wonderful example of what eXquire does well, as the Brooklynite shifts his flows casually, pounding away in declarative bars about ""his mind's eye, wide awake at high noon,"" before going into a 50 Cent-style singsong right before the chorus. Unfortunately, there isn't even a second verse, a letdown which foreshadows the issues to come.</p>
<p>Near the end of ""The Message Pt. 1 &amp; 2"", there's a telling line. ""Used to rhyme when shit got hectic now this shit be my profession."" Now that he's been made to do this for a living, eXquire doesn't seem to have much interest in the constant grind required by that life, at least if this tape is any indication. Rappers like Cam'ron and Action Bronson can get away with this kind of inconsistency-- their stream of consciousness phrasemaking doesn't require much focus. And someone like Gucci Mane, who shows up for a nice turn on ""Telephuck"", doesn't have to focus at all. Nearly everything appealing about him is extra-lyrical. But eXquire, at his best, is a storyteller. To tell a story, you need to be able to concentrate all the way through. And <i>Power and Passion</i> is blighted by a rapper who seems too distracted by his woes to sit down and write more than a couple of full songs.</p></div>"|17146.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17146-power-and-passion/|5.4|Jonah Bromwich

That music-making has included pretty diverse, encompassing noise, drone, psych, techno, extended guitar (see his most recent effort in the duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30753-sarin-smoke/"">Sarin Smoke</a> with Charalambides' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/919-tom-carter/"">Tom Carter</a>), and more.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Swanson decided his noisy take on EDM is worth developing further, and on the three-track <i>Pro Style</i> he does just that. In fact, he uses the shorter format not to tighten, but to expand-- two of the three songs here are longer than any single cut on <i>Man With Potential</i>, and they all stretch further, morphing together patterns with a more graded progression. Still, this is bold, busy music, with lots of sonic debris flying around while Swanson's beats drive forward. And <i>Pro Style </i>is more accessible and punchy than Swanson's previous effort. You can imagine his hectic maelstrom pounding through a sweaty club late at night.</p>
<p><i>Pro Style</i>'s relative accessibility comes from its more prominent beats. The difference is a matter of shading, since the beats on <i>Man With Potential </i>weren't exactly buried. But here Swanson turns the hue up on his throbbing pulses, making them shine more brightly and speed past more vividly. That's at least true of the opening title track, which steps on the beat pedal 30 seconds in and never lets up, navigating technicolor noises that swirl like confetti in a wind tunnel. The following track, ""Pro Style (VIP)"", offers a fascinating variation: wooly and abrasive, it chops beats into pure static, creating an hypnotic swath of cutting noise. The result is some of the most catchy abstraction imaginable-- think of it as dancehall fuzz.</p>
<p><i>Pro Style </i>gets most expansive during 12-minute closer ""Do You Like Students?"" Here, Swanson fully engages something he perfected with his Yellow Swans partner Gabriel Saloman: a knack for building sound so gradually that it overwhelms you before you realize it, like a drug that kicks in while you're focused on something else. ""Do You Like Students?"" also has the druggy effect of being both hectic and soothing, which is what to me makes Swanson's music more like head-targeted psychedelia than body-moving dance.</p>
<p>But this is just one side of Swanson we're talking about-- certainly he'll continue to pursue all the myriad modes he's chased in the past, with effects both mental and physical. I like the idea of his EDM-leaning alter ego continuing alongside his other musical personalities, though, staying its bold, pulsing course as Swanson dives freely into whatever other tangents his various muses dictate.</p></div>"|17401.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17401-pro-style-ep/|7.9|Marc Masters

That works in their favor as they face a new and strange set of challenges on their third album: Their brand of dark electro has proven so influential in recent years that it's put them in danger of sounding <i>normal</i> in 2012. Their first two records were explosive, unpredictable, and found them living on borrowed time, trying to outlast the blog-house fad that spawned their earliest singles and outstrip a run of bad publicity caused by early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/33548-crystal-castles-artist-settle-madonna-image-dispute/"">copyright disputes</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/35098-crystal-castles-dallas-shitstorm/"">cancelled gigs</a>. ""The world is a dystopia where victims don't get justice and corruption prevails,"" Alice Glass <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47948-crystal-castles-announce-new-album-iii/"">recently vented</a>. ""I'm one step away from being a vigilante to protect people and bring justice to the people I love."" Indeed, her lyrics on the fiercely aggressive <i>(III)</i> take on a newfound importance, often reading like the broken promises of an overworked guardian angel. </p>
<p>Though the duo claims to have overhauled their recording process for <i>(III)</i>, trading in all of their gear and disallowing the use of computers in the studio, the album couldn't be mistaken for the work of anyone else. It retains Ethan Kath's trademark staggered synths and Glass' acute wail still pierces through thick reverb. The music now conveys a sense of unease somewhere between waiting for the drugs to kick in and wanting to leave the club as soon as possible. As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47910-new-crystal-castles-album-coming-in-november/"">promised</a>, it is unyieldingly ""bleak."" Even the catchy songs are filtered through a forbidding darkness. ""Pale Flesh"" exhumes witch house for just long enough to beat it at its own game, ""Sad Eyes"" is pure rave throwback, and the call-and-response hooks that materialize as scrambled vocal transmissions (""Kerosene"") and longing synth countermelodies (""Affection"") come off like power-pop played by catatonic automatons.</p>
<p>While not as immediately striking as either <i>Crystal Castles</i> (I or II), the streamlined sound allows more maneuverability and subtle variety in the actual songwriting. Crystal Castles songs could once be split into two camps, the ""pretty"" ones and the ""aggressive"" ones; <i>(III)</i> is the duo's most focused record, and the fact that it avoids assaults like ""Doe Deer"" or ""Alice Practice"" demonstrates an alluring confidence. Even the all-texture tracks (""Telepath"", ""Insulin"") are more driven by rhythm than abrasion; they contribute to the overall flow rather than hijacking it. </p>
<p>Insularity is nothing new for Crystal Castles, as both of their self-titled records existed in a sort of personal airlock. Shortly after the release of<i> Crystal Castles</i> (II), they re-cast its cover of Platinum Blonde's ""Not in Love"" with Robert Smith on lead vocals, resulting in their most successful single to date, but it had the unintended effect of making the emotional illegibility of their own version more apparent. At the end of the tightly coiled ""Kerosene"", Glass reveals a desire to connect, breathing a promise of equal menace and love: ""I'll protect you from all the things I've seen."" Glass' lyrics are often addressed to children facing horrors they can't quite process or future atrocities they can't imagine-- references to blood, wounds, antiseptics, and soil are frequent, as well as a warning to ""sell your bones for ivory.""</p>
<p>So how is this popular, exactly? Fair question. Pop music is often considered to be synonymous with escapism, but it can also be cathartic, and many records this year have shared <i>(III)</i>'s apocalyptic bent. Albums by Swans and Godspeed You! Black Emperor view 2012 in the Mayan sense, predicting a form of divine retribution that will be cataclysmic but also possibly awesome. And while the typical goth jokes came easy when ""Affection"" dropped on Halloween, look at it in the context of being just another day: the New York Marathon planned to go on despite the destruction of Hurricane Sandy, the cover of the latest <a href=""http://onwardstate.com/2012/10/30/penn-state-featured-on-cover-of-sports-illustrated/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Sports Illustrated</i></a> featured a story surveying the ""resilience"" of the Penn State football team a year after the Jerry Sandusky scandal erupted, and we were in the homestretch of an American presidential election that actually fostered the discussion of what constitutes ""legitimate rape."" Whether you listen to Crystal Castles or not, this is a time of confrontation, conflict, and stress, and the success of <i>(III)</i> is how it brings you close enough to the evil that men do to be shocked, repulsed, and affected by it.</p></div>"|17272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17272-iii/|8.0|Ian Cohen

From their 1986 formation through to the b(r)and's dissolution in 2004, Guided by Voices proper released an average of one full-length album per year. That's a brisk clip for most acts, but a relative coffee drip when you consider the song overflow Pollard continues to divert to his exponentially increasing array of solo and side projects. So his decision last year to revive Guided by Voices with its ""classic"" 1992-96-era line-up suggested a return not just to the band's ramshackle roots, but their old quality-control standards as well.</p>
<p>The band's actual post-reunion strategy tells a different story. Pollard and co. were already well into their mid-30s when the band first emerged in the early 90s. Now, two decades on, they seem determined to make the most of this second wind and release as much music as possible while they can still physically withstand the scissor kicks and windmills. <i>The Bears for Lunch</i> is their third album of 2012, following January's comeback <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16131-lets-go-eat-the-factory/"" target=""_blank""><i>Let's Go Eat the Factory</i></a> and June's<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16740-class-clown-spots-a-ufo/"" target=""_blank""> <i>Class Clown Spots a UFO</i></a>. And like its immediate predecessors, <i>The Bears</i> effectively picks up where this line-up left off with 1996's <i>Under the Bushes Under the Stars</i>, mediating between the band's formative lo-fi lunacy and their desire for a more streamlined sound. </p>
<p>But if all this new GBV material faithfully approximates the form and fidelity of the band's signature works, its impact has been diminished by a lack of context or conceptual vision. Back in the mid-90s, each new GBV album played out like a game of ""will they or won't they"": would Pollard and his trusty foil Tobin Sprout limit their morsels of melody to 60-second spurts, or would they allow the songs to flourish into alternate-universe power-pop classics? And despite their randomized appearances, those album sequences were always carefully considered, where even the seemingly throwaway tracks were strategically stitched into the crazy-quilt patchwork. But by mostly settling into the <i>Under the Bushes</i> mid-fi comfort zone, the band's 2012 albums mostly just sound like one Guided by Voices song after another-- some exceptional, some forgettable. That's hardly a bum deal for long-time fans, but there's little sense of the organizing principles that made those early albums eminently replayable and rewarding.</p>
<p><i>The Bears for Lunch</i>, however, is the most consistent of this year's trifecta. It may not boast an instant, indeliable earworm like <i>Class Clown</i>'s ""Keep It Motion"" or <i>Factory</i>'s ""Doughnut for a Snowman"", but there are no buzzkill duds like ""The Big Hat and Toy Show"" either. And, of the three, it's the album that most faithfully approximates the tumbling, track-to-track momentum of the band's mid-90s masterworks, with off-the-cuff oddities like the gruff busker ditty ""Have a Jug"" and the absurdist chant ""Finger Gang"" effectively setting up more dignified, resonant turns like ""Hangover Child"" and ""The Challenge Is Much More"". </p>
<p>As per GBV tradition, Pollard's lyrical concerns mostly orbit around aviation, medieval folklore, and boys of various preternatural abilities. So the greatest revelations here come when Pollard seemingly takes stock of his own mortality, as on the sleazily suggestive love song ""She Lives in an Airport"" (""she makes it quicker and competition thicker/ designed to spark up a real weak ticker"") or on ""The Military School Dance Dismissal"", which sounds like Pollard crooning a <i>Hunky Dory</i> piano ballad in some Dayton dive at the age of 85. Sprout, for his part, responds to Pollard's ever-changing whims by keeping his feet firmly planted in <i>Rubber Soul</i>, contributing <i>The Bears</i>' most richly melodious songs in the folksy ""Waking Up the Stars"" and ""Waving at Airplanes"" (the latter of which is no less poignant for pinching its acoustic fanfare from Bad Company's ""Feel Like Makin' Love""). </p>
<p>Taken together, GBV's three releases this year plot an alternate late-90s course for the band, one which in Pollard stuck with his basement buds and never hooked up with Cobra Verde for 1997's muscular <i>Mag Earwhig!</i>, never signed to TVT, and never asked for Ric Ocasek's phone number. This GBV would've simply continued to crank out album after album of pleasingly wobbly indie rock, gradually refining their craft and reining in their eccentricities but stopping short of realizing their hi-fi arena rock potential.</p>
<p>Still, as <i>The Bears</i>' late-album progression gets tripped up by the one-note discord of ""Tree Fly Jet"" and ""Amorphous Surprise"", you can't help but think the band's re-emergence would be that much more dramatic if they had pared down their three 2012 releases into one record stacked with the best songs from each; surely, no O.G. GBV fan would've felt cheated by receiving ""only"" a single, no-filler album from a line-up they never thought they'd see in action again. After all, Guided by Voices' 1994 critical breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3600-bee-thousand-the-directors-cut/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bee Thousand</i></a> was as much a triumph of judicious pruning as quality songcraft; the most important takeaway from this year is that Guided by Voices can still produce enough of the latter to allow for the luxury of the former.</p></div>"|17321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17321-the-bears-for-lunch/|7.3|Stuart Berman

She's collaborated with Dave Pearce of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1524-flying-saucer-attack/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Saucer Attack</a>, and is in once sense his U.S. equivalent. Though both touch on slowcore and shoegaze, they are are impossible to pin down, playing with any number of other bands; both make songs that range from short piano pieces to 20-minute feedback driven monsters. </p>
<p><i>At the Down-Turned Jagged Rim of the Sky</i>, her first full-length since 2006, is on the one hand just another Jessica Bailiff album, suffused with her cool, half-chanted singing and plenty of sonic murk. But it's also quite unlike anything she's done before. It's focused, without the lengthy experiments, and the flow of the album is coherent. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3201-odd-nosdam/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Nosdam</a>'s mixing adds a subtle punch, and her songs sometimes bring to mind New Zealand experimentalist Graeme Jefferies of the Cakekitchen, offering a specific vision of hooks, delivery, and fuzz.</p>
<p>But throughout <i>At the Down-Turned Jagged Rim of the Sky,</i> Bailiff's music resists easy summary. The opening <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14297-your-ghost-is-not-enough/"" target=""_blank"">""Your Ghost Is Not Enough""</a> is a strong meditation on the tensions and feelings of long-distance relationships, and two songs later, ""Sanguine"" revolves around a fat burst of organ, bass, and increasingly louder guitars. The latter brings to mind the Doors fronted by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14952-trish-keenan/"" target=""_blank"">Trish Keenan</a> at first, but it transforms into something that's all Bailiff by the end. And then ""If You Say It"" takes it to a further level with what could be gentle flutes bubbling through the mix.</p>
<p>That all this was done in a home studio by Bailiff is no surprise-- that's part of her approach from the start, even as she's maintained her other musical efforts and day-to-day life. Bailiff not only resists whatever a trend might be in favor of her own instincts, she is also not afraid to go big in a way that neither apes modern mega-production nor just relies on a laptop patch to approximate it. There are, always, other routes, and she knows how to find them here. </p>
<p>A strong example comes near the end of the record with ""Goodnight"". Initially, a solo piano traces a melodic loop over humming drone, with Bailiff's vocals coming in as a gentle sway back and forth. It all sounds like a ballad, though a line like ""It makes me sick"" suggests something else at work: At nearly two minutes into the track that something else happens, as big guitars and drums emerge. They're buried just enough into the mix-- a suppressed anger and roar-- that the song feels like it's about to fully snap a tether. The extra organ that appears after three minutes adds further intensity, an unafraid embrace of the overpowering, while isolated strings emerge at the end. A lullaby this isn't.</p>
<p class=""p1"">There's a clear sense of arrangement and precision throughout. Often there's no overt variation or change in a song, but when subtle changes do emerge after careful listening, you get a sense of how her understated touch creates a strong impact. Bringing scope and space to a more intimate level, the miniature epic ""This is Real"" demonstrates the virtues of the slow build and Bailiff's careful placement: repeated keyboard parts are matched by guitars, then voices take the place of the guitars as new guitars are added into the background. It feels like sweeping exultance, a sigh, and the title's reach for something grounded.</p>
<p>That the album ends on the gentler note of the easygoing pop jam ""Firefly"" seems apt: <i>Down-Turned</i> is an album that starts in two different worlds, explores a range of possibilities, and ends brightly. It sounds exactly like what a fan of Bailiff would hope for, while offering something new and distinct<i>.</i> And it's proof that she knows her own particular path is the best one to follow.</p></div>"|17409.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17409-at-the-down-turned-jagged-rim-of-the-sky/|7.5|Ned Raggett

Ask the two record labels responsible for its being re-pressed after residing deep in obscurity for over 30 years and you might get answers like: ""The album was created in part for research and therapeutic purposes, but that's all we can say,"" or, ""a few of the names of the professional studio musicians who played on the record might be familiar to aficionados of the disco era."" Also: ""Play the record, and everything becomes more unclear still...""</p>
<p>If it helps to muddy matters, there's a straight-faced <a href=""http://www.yogarecords.com/artists/madmusic/madmusic-pressrelease.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PDF</a> on the <a href=""http://www.yogarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yoga Records</a> website that accompanies their reissue of this genre-sloughing, beguiling, idiosyncratic LP, as well as a Mad Music logo of what may be a laughing Lex Luthor with an 8-track player embedded in the side of his head, a long-since disconnected phone number underneath. Yet there are no answers for what Mad Music Inc. ever was, if it was in fact anything other than a self-funded whim undertaken in the late 70s. In talking to Yoga's Douglas Mcgowan, he insinuated that the project stemmed from one Bostonian in particular who dabbled in the piano and had the discretionary funds to hire a bunch of studio musicians to flesh out such musings. He then went on to compare the proceedings to when early 20th-century spiritual teacher George Ivanovich Gurdjieff had his hummings turned into piano music by composer and spiritual devotee Thomas de Hartmann.</p>
<p>There is an ineffable spiritual feel to the 11 untitled tracks that constitute <i>Mad Music</i>, at times bolstered by what sounds like a sonic precursor to New Age music. And for readers who instinctively shiver at the latter genre, be forewarned the album has plenty of flute and harp coursing across its sides, especially on the opening track, suggesting a mellow moment from either an Alice Coltrane record or a privately pressed <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/breathe-instrumental-meditation-mw0000695555"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">record</a> that teaches you how to breathe. But for all of its seeming New Age earmarks, the ever-shifting music here courses and changes so that MMInc. soon never feels beholden to any one genre.</p>
<p>The third track mingles piano, sitar, and a wordless female vocal that evokes middle-period Popul Vuh, as elegant and weightless as Ophelia's lace adrift in a river. But minutes later, on the fourth track, there's a funky, elastic bassline wrapping around the piano line, and a female voices cooing ""aah"" and ""la"" that briefly evoke the weird Steely Dan moment that occurs on adventurous composer Blue Gene Tyranny's 1978 album <a href=""http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/blue-gene-tyranny/out-of-the-blue.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Out of the Blue</i></a>. Of all the songs, this one seems most likely to correspond to a track called ""Gospel Disco"", the never-pressed 45 label art that also appears in that befuddling PDF. At other moments, the fastidious and distinct envisioning of how to make so many sounds come together remind me of certain aspects of Italian composer Luciano Cilio's devastating album from the year before, <i><a href=""http://youtu.be/95BwFLCVX9U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dialoghi del presente</a>.</i></p>
<p>Most of the second half of the album emphasizes this mysterious creator's piano meditations, sometimes featuring a bit of French horn or cymbal (and in one instance, a creaking door), foretelling of the imminent ""New Age"" invasion just on the horizon. It's not for every reader's sensibilities, but fans of the aforementioned artists would enjoy such a mystery. And there's a peculiarity present, in part serious but also mischievous-- clues and red herrings both-- that dashes any pat classification. When it first appeared in 1977, each copy of Mad Music Inc. contained random ephemera perhaps associated with the recording process (which Drag City painstakingly recreates here), from photos of a Moog synthesizer to instructions for installing an underwater loudspeaker to a 1973 article published in <i>The New Englander</i> titled ""Business Tries Meditating"", surmising that the ""Maharishi makes sense in board room."" Which may be the most sensible statement here.</p></div>"|17343.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17343-mad-music/|6.9|Andy Beta

""One wants to strengthen the nation's existing safety net, Tami Luhby wrote, referring to the incumbent. ""The other wants to overhaul it.""</p>
<p>In only three days, the piece generated nearly 4,000 comments, largely a seesaw of partisan bickering about the inherent fecklessness of the unemployed or the itinerant greed that led the nation to its current ""fiscal cliff."" But as much as the onslaught of responses is indicative of the polarized politics of America in 2012, it also offered an insight into another near-immortal scenario-- not poverty or welfare, but the endless cycle of going to work to pay the bills, accumulated in the quest to enjoy life a little bit. Some commenters resented those that, for some reason or another, weren't required to join that drudgery; others lamented not having the chance to join the drudgery. It is, after all, one of society's most familiar and profound conditions.  </p>
<p>That is the pivotally resonant point of <i>Work Hard, Play Hard, Pray Hard</i>, a collection of 42 songs recorded between 1923 and 1936 and sorted eight decades later into three compact discs, each named for a respective phrase of that titular series. The thesis comes condensed by David McCarn, a Carolina cotton-mill worker who eventually took to riding the rails, on his guitar-and-harmonica trot, ""Poor Man, Rich Man (Cotton Mill Colic No. 2)"". His boss is a terror, and his wages are slim; his debts are high, however, and his belly is hungry. But at least he and his peers ""take a little drink to have a little fun,"" the premise of <i>Play Hard</i>'s Prohibition-era songs of homemade beer and corn-liquor hootenannies. There's a resiliency to McCarn's song, too; his voice metes his situation with, at once, playfulness and resilience. He's staying alive, he sings between the lines, because there must be something more than this. </p>
<p>These three discs offer a week's worth of songs recorded before or during The Great Depression, and as importantly, at the apogee or end of Prohibition: There's Monday-through-Friday music for whistling about work, Saturday music for and about the joys of drinking and dancing, and Sunday morning spirituals with their eyes on a distant but unwavering salvation. Even if you don’t share the particular beliefs, there’s a joy to this hopefulness, to this belief in some success awaiting the end of a grinding daily toil. That's the feeling that this set summarizes. </p>
<p>A few of these cuts will be familiar to even casual listeners: Warren Caplinger's Cumberland Mountain Entertainers contribute a prowling version of ""McDonald's Farm"", complete with shout-along harmonies and barnyard noises. Earl Johnson files a loose take on ""When the Roses Bloom Again for the Bootlegger"", an incarcerated lament set to the tune of an old familiar number since reworked by countless singers and bands, from Johnny Cash to Wilco. </p>
<p>But unless you're an expert (and, in some cases, even if you are), many of these tracks and the peculiarities of the singers and instrumentalists who cut them will be complete surprises, offering the same avenues for exploration and preponderance as a history documentary or, in some cases, mystery theater. The stories of Red Gay &amp; Jack Wellman, for instance, aren't well-known, but their two-part ""Flat Wheel Train Blues"" is completely mesmerizing, its click-clack guitar and strangely melancholic fiddle displaying life on the rails as one of rote insistence and tiny adventures. It's implicitly a song about begrudging work but finding some way to love it just enough to live with it. ""The Beer Party"", a three-minute mix of a variety show and a string-band barn dance, suggests country music as a rarified form of function and fashion, with the band serving as a jukebox upon the coronation of a new keg. On the frantic Tennessee Ramblers tune ""The Preacher Got Drunk and Laid Down His Bible"", the secular taunts the sacred with a drunk reverend and a faithfully unfaithful woman-- seemingly risky stuff for a string band in the rural South during the middle of Prohibition. And on <i>Pray Hard</i>, ""Beyond the Starry Plane"" endlessly intrigues beneath a layer of noise etched by time into the groove. It's a call for ascendancy and assurance, faintly echoing nearly a century later. Nearly nothing is known about the band except this piece of faded incandescence. ""An infinitesimal point of communion,"" John Jeremiah Sullivan calls the droning number in the set's thorough liner notes. That's also an apt descriptor for <i>Work Hard, Play Hard, Pray Hard</i>, a set that does double duty by offering broad historical context and, thanks to the subjects of these songs, absolutely relevant commentary on the standing struggles of the proletariat, no matter current election results. </p>
<p>The bulk of the sides on <i>Work Hard, Play Hard, Pray Hard</i> were salvaged by guitarist and nascent archivist <a href=""http://noquarter.net/bands/salsburg.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nathan Salsburg</a>. Nearly three years ago, a friend of Salsburg's called to say that he'd stumbled upon a trove of old and abused records in the home of a Kentucky man who died a week earlier. That night, Salsburg dug through boxes of ketchup bottles and old 78-rpm records in a dumpster outside of the late man's home, steadily realizing that he'd found more than the standard collection of grandparent vinyl. Despite his early skepticism, Salsburg knew that the records amassed by Don Wahle-- an enigma with an almost entirely unknown backstory, aside from the dilapidated boxes of music and record catalogue receipts Salsburg rescued-- transmitted tales of folk and country music in America that were either previously obscure or altogether untold. This set comprises those stories. </p>
<p>There's something incredibly sweet and poignant about Wahle's narrative, or lack thereof. Though he once attempted to get into the business of selling some of these sides, there is, at least according to Salsburg, no evidence that he ever managed to sell anything. Instead, Salsburg found boxes of unopened LP reissues from the <a href=""http://www.yazoorecords.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">better-known</a> folk-rescue <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/Old%20Homestead%20Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">labels</a> in Wahle's house. These tunes, or the acquisition of them, seemed to have become his personal version of <i>playing hard</i>, a hobby and thrill that never funneled into academic output or commercial compensation. When he died, they almost passed along with him. But now, these songs are, like their subjects, for all-time, annotated by the impressively scholastic Salsburg and made available by Tompkins Square, a label that has joined the greats in broadening our understanding of music's breadth of both sound and story. Right now, especially, this collection is hard to put away.</p></div>"|17318.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17318-work-hard-play-hard-pray-hard-hard-time-good-time-end-time-music-1923-1936/|8.3|Grayson Currin

As America's finest living Canadian songwriter (tied with Neil Young), few musicians have understood its nature so well. In the 1960s and 70s, Mitchell was Mary Magdalene to Dylan's folk-rock messiah, making music that was bittersweet and relatable, carrying what Dylan begat even further. Her work helped birth a new idiom that was personal and poetic, creating a new space for songs that made artistic statements, unbound by cliché and tradition. Such was the strength of her music that Mitchell's lyrics didn't have to make sense. But they did, particularly to women.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell's first 10 studio albums, cut during an 11-year span, have been gathered in this import box set. During this run, Mitchell charted one of the most solid career arcs in contemporary music that then detoured into one of the strangest, following her muse into places that very nearly cost her career and exhausted her fanbase's patience. Throughout, she was confident and unrepentant in her vision, in an era where that kind of ego was unbefitting a woman, even if she did have the gold albums and Grammys™ to back it up. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is a basic set-- no frills, just all the albums' original layouts reproduced in envelope sleeves, the fonts so tiny only mice could read them. There are no extras, outtakes or re-anythinged. But taking these 10 records in a row, chronologically, it is a striking reminder no single artist has had a run like Joni (even her acolyte Prince only got to seven albums before he started to fall off). Mitchell was pop's first female auteur, an innovator of singular talent, whose influence was vast, immediate (see: Led Zeppelin's ""Going to California"") and long lasting (Joanna Newsom, St. Vincent, Taylor Swift's kiss'n'tell cottage industry).</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell was ""discovered"" c. 1968 when ex-Byrd David Crosby pulled up in a sailboat outside the Florida club she was playing and took her to L.A. At the time, folk was out of fashion yet Mitchell managed to pull down an unprecedented major label deal for a girl and her guitar: total and complete artistic freedom, with the caveat that Crosby would produce her first album. It was rare for a woman to be writing and recording her own material at the time, let alone to be an unaccompanied solo act. Though Mitchell's debut, <b><i>Song to a Seagull</i></b>, was a heavy precedent for the era it's a harder listen now, the fin de siècle earth-mama lyrics playing strange against the stilted, formal musical settings. The delicate album suffers under Crosby's intrusive production; Mitchell would self-produce from then on. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Clouds</i></b> (1969) is the introduction to Mitchell's real deal, shaking folk tradition and giving off a little humor and spirit. The album sounds <i>casual</i>. Lyrically, she was transitioning from the era's de facto hippie sensualism (colors! the weather! vibes!) to the classically prosodic style (Keats! Cohen!) she'd become known for. The album's biggest signs of life are two of her most famous songs-- the kicky ""Chelsea Morning"", which is about as straightforward as Mitchell ever got, and ""Both Sides Now"". Though she'd known burden and heartache plenty by her still-tender age (she'd borne a child alone and in secret after dropping out of art school and married singer Chuck Mitchell in order to make a family; he changed his mind a month later and she put the baby up for adoption) she sounds a bit too young and chipper to be singing about disillusionment. Still, <i>Clouds</i> was a landmark, and she landed a Grammy for Best Folk Performance.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Ladies of the Canyon</i></b> from 1970 is Mitchell's most accessible album and it introduces her earnest folk-pop style. Her voice is newly elastic and expressive, and it's the first record where she sounds like she might actually be fun to hang out with. <i>Ladies </i>also features her generation-defining ""Woodstock"", ""The Circle Game"" (Mitchell's answer back to Neil Young's nostalgic ""Sugar Mountain""), and her blustery gentrification sing-along, ""Big Yellow Taxi"". All were hippie-era sing-along staples; it hardly bears remarking that these songs are some of Mitchell's corniest. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The genius of <i>Ladies </i>is often circumscribed by Mitchell's proximity to CSNY; the vocal arrangement and production invariably propped to Crosby's influence, ""Woodstock"" supposedly inspired by Nash's recounting of the event (she wrote it before he'd even returned from the festival). If <i>Ladies</i> does bear the mark of CSNY, it's to the album's detriment. The fruits of the Nash/Mitchell romance-- his gee-whiz domestic ode, ""Our House"" and <i>Ladies</i>' ""Willy""-- are saccharine at best. Their subsequent break up would inspire much more potent work-- Neil Young's ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and Mitchell's follow-up. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">About that follow-up: 1971's <b><i>Blue</i></b> is possibly the most gutting break-up album ever made. After Mitchell's relationship with Nash dissolved, she headed to Europe to lose the tether of her fame, eventually taking exile in a cave on the Greek island Crete. The trip would inspire the how-Joni-got-her-groove-back ditties ""Carey"" and ""California"". The album is suffused with melancholy for all that is missing: her daughter (""Little Green""), innocence (""The Last Time I Saw Richard""), and connection (""All I Want""). Mitchell bleeds diffidence and highlights it with spare notes plucked out on her Appalachian dulcimer. While her pals Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and Laura Nyro were also pushing the singer-songwriter genre forward, none of them managed to stride the distance that Mitchell did here in a single album.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">""Will you take me as I am/ Strung out on another man?"" Mitchell pleads on ""California"". She was (in)famously strung out on other talents that were as mercurial as hers, fueling constant speculation as to whether this song was about Leonard Cohen, or that one about James Taylor or Nash or that puerile heartbreaker Jackson Browne. The year Mitchell issued <i>Blue</i>, an album that would be a landmark in any artist's career, Rolling Stone named her ""Old Lady of the Year,"" a dismissal effectively saying her import was as a girlfriend or muse to the men around her more than as an artist in her own right. Worse still, they called her ""Queen of El Lay,"" and offered a diagram of her supposed affairs and conquests. She'd made the best album of her career and in exchange she got slut-shamed in the biggest music magazine in America. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell retired to her homestead in Canada and returned sounding confident for 1972's <b><i>For the Roses</i></b>. Up until <i>Roses </i>she'd kept things minimal, here she stacked multi-tracks of impossible vocals harmonies, mimicking a horn section (""Let the Wind Carry Me"") or interpolating and dueling with jazzer sideman Tom Scott's riffing woodwinds. Mitchell's vocals, fluttering unpredictably and with stunning control between the bottom of her range and the top of her crystalline contralto, were given a new stop; her heavy smoking had given her a heretofore non-existent midrange. There's really no singing along with <i>Roses</i>--  which is a fabulous fuck-you for a pop artist.</span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though part of the reason that she'd retired from performing in 1969 was to avoid the default of writing about the myopic rock'n'roll life, <i>Roses</i>' standout track, ""Blonde in the Bleachers"", shows that she may have understood it better than any of the boys; it is one of the best songs ever written about the rules and (gender) roles of the road. ""It seems like you've got to give up/ Such a piece of your soul /When you give up the chase,"" she sings, about finding identity and meaning in who you fuck. Freedom is an evergreen subject for Mitchell, but ""Blonde in the Bleachers"" gets beyond the thrill in partaking of what-- or, rather, who-- is offered up, backstage. The quiet story here is the ebbing power of a woman once she's been conquered.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell was criticized for not making blatantly feminist or political (read: sloganeering) albums, her work was always tacitly so. Her songs spotlight the unspoken roles of women (""Barandgrill""), who they were <i>unrelated</i> to men; she gave them names and precise details. There is hardly a more feminist topic than striving for a freedom that life and love has never allowed you. On ""Woman of Heart and Mind"", it's hard to tell whether she is mocking herself or the man she is singing to (or both): ""Push your papers/ Win your medals/ Fuck your strangers/ Don't it leave you on the empty side /I'm looking for affection and respect."" On <i>Roses</i>, Mitchell sounds like a woman who's had enough of everyone else's shit, an attitude that certainly put her in line with the libbers.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Her 1974 commercial break-out, <b><i>Court and Spark</i></b>, found her backed by first-call jazz session cats L.A. Express. It was her official severance from folk music. <i>Court</i> is her most pop album and gave her three chart hits, going gold five weeks after its release. Mitchell's production features heavy and sudden multi-tracked swells of her voice that spike melodies like a choir of accusing angels and mimic strings and horns. Her arrangement on ""Down to You"" (aided by Express bandleader Tom Scott) is stunning in its complexity, yet it never shakes you; it is still utterly a pop song. </span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Now six albums deep on the topic of love and loss, <i>Court</i> has a marked cynicism. It's a grown up album about arriving at the intractable issues of adult love. ""Help Me"", which was Mitchell's only top 10 hit, is reluctant about romance; she's ""hoping for the future/ And worrying about the past."" The refrain is pocked by the dawnlight realizations of that post-free love era: ""We love our lovin'/ But not like we love our freedom."" For the largeness of her band (which included Joe Sample of the Crusaders, and Larry Carlton, soon to be of every memorable Steely Dan guitar solo) they are nimble throughout; their finesse suited her own. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">To explain how and what happened next in Mitchell's career-- how much her <i>The Hissing of Summer Lawns</i> was viewed as not a stylistic departure but a <i>betrayal</i>-- we must first look at the run up. While promoting <i>Court</i>, what could easily be defined as the commercial and artistic high-water mark of her career, Mitchell went to go see Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour and wound up joining. At the time, she was a peer of Dylan, commercially and as a songwriter, she was also tight with tour member Robbie Robertson of the Band. She had a song in the Billboard Top 10-- <i>and she was opening</i>. When Mitchell recounts this in later interviews, she talks about how being on the tour was a matter of constantly having to subvert her ego to the men around her. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">At this same time, many of her peers were headed further toward the mainstream, towards syncopation, towards rock, towards retro revivalism. Mitchell saw there was not much of a place for her amongst the new talents and the Peter Pan-ing crew she came up with, as a woman in her early 30s, and she saw jazz as a genre that would allow her to age gracefully and expand as an artist-- and so there she went. She was trying to find or develop a place to belong. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Through all of this she arrived at <i><b>Hissing of Summer Lawns</b>.</i></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The 1975 album marks Mitchell's official departure from the mainstream, her embarking upon her jazzbo journey. It's the album of an artist absolutely assured of herself, and it's addressed to anyone who might not consider her a <i>serious</i> musician, who believed all she could do was confess her heartache. Though it doesn't have the rhapsodic rep as <i>Blue</i>, it's unquestionably one of Mitchell's finest albums, and it is certainly her most timeless. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">It opens easy enough with ""In France They Kiss on Main Street""-- a soft, linear move from <i>Court</i>. What follows is jarring if you were expecting more of the same: ""The Jungle Line"" runs over a distorting sample of the Royal Drummers of Burundi tribal pounding and chanting. Mitchell going from husky to her enunciation so precise about ""the mathematic circuits of the modern nights,"" the long, low whirring of a Moog running the melody line under Mitchell's acoustic strumming. The rest of the record is dark, tense, and lilts unapologetically toward something softer and more ornate than jazz fusion (no more than the later Steely Dan records it predated) with Mitchell singing observationally, about the place of women in the world, about the trade-offs they make for power and freedom. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell and women of her generation had been brought up with the idea that marriage to a man who took care of them would fulfill them entirely and that ambitions beyond that were frivolous. The album is a reckoning reflective of culture at the time; <i>Hissing </i>is an album of women trying to find their real selves in a world that had groomed them for quiet obeisance to men. On ""Harry's House"" Mitchell sings of a curdling domestic scene, of wives who ""paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid."" The song dovetails into the standard ""Centerpiece"", which she sings in a voice not her own, playacting with this ultra-feminine throwback voice, creating a critical distance when she sings the lines: ""I'm building all my dreams around you/ Our happiness will never cease/ 'Cause nothing's any good without you/ Baby you're my centerpiece.""<i> </i>And on the subtlety devastating ""Sweet Bird"", she sings of women wielding power through beauty and youth, and what is lost and gained in that bargaining: ""Power ideals and beauty/ Fading in everyone's hand"" and ""Calendars of our lives/ Circled with compromise.""</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell had never made a record that wasn't bigger than the one before and was shocked that her fans and many critics saw her new sound as an abandonment and misguided move, respectively. Reviewers chastised her for her ego. While the album went gold and brought her a Grammy nod, as her 1974 live album <i>Miles of Aisles</i> attests (a wonky fiasco, skip it) there were still plenty of people shouting for ""Big Yellow Taxi"". But that Joni didn't live here anymore. <i>Hissing</i> was proof. The era of Mitchell doing no wrong was over and if her audience couldn't hang, she wasn't about to do anything to reel them back in.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The two albums that followed are where Mitchell went off the grid. <i><b>Hejira</b>,</i> from 1976, was written while driving alone from Maine to L.A. and is a meditation on the value and melancholy of being alone, her guitar imitating the rhythms and expanse of the road. In spots it's as emotionally bare as <i>Blue</i>. It's a real <i>grown woman</i> album and may not make tremendous sense to anyone under 30. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Musically, Mitchell says she was trying to see how far she could get from traditional rhythm; the songs are long and lovely, burbling and unspooling. Whether or not you feel this era of Mitchell is unfairly maligned depends on how you feel about Jaco Pastorious and his fretless bass and its many, many notes fardling way up high in the mix. His playing lends a darkly cinematic feeling to the album, but in the decades since his trademark sound and style have been taken to such unpleasant extremes by jam and light jazz bands, it's understandable to experience a visceral revulsion.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Inspired by the rhythms of Brazilian music, Mitchell issued the experimental double-album <b><i>Don Juan's Reckless Daughter</i></b> in '77. Her experiments went further than just musical; she appears in brownface and an afro wig as a man on the cover. Less commented on is her in ""injun"" costume on the back, palm raised, a bubble above her head reads ""How!"" (Her cringe-inducing arguments about it later on included statements about how she has a ""black man's soul""). The album is <i>solidly</i> jazz-fusion, indulgent in length with still plenty of Jaco-dominance. But! there is reward in the album's centerpiece, if you can make it that far: The 16-minute ""Paprika Plains"" is a freakout of a song suite, inspired in part by a conversation with prickly ol' Bob Dylan. Even if you cannot abide by the album, we must be grateful for it, as it is Bjork's #1 favorite album and source of inspiration. The last piece in the box, <b><i>Mingus</i></b>, her 1979 collaboration with Charles Mingus before his death makes her seem like the jazz dilettante that people accused her of being. The ultimate result doesn't serve either of their legacies particularly well.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell's weird escapade through pop doesn't end where the box set does, she never recaptured the thread of popular imagination. Her 80s albums, like many of her hippie-era peers', were overbearing and scolding and featured awkward embraces of technology. She retired for long stretches to focus on her painting. Her last good record was 2000's <i>Both Sides Now</i>, where, her range ravaged by decades of smoking, she sings the definitive version of the titular song that launched her career and finally sounds like she's seen enough to know. </span></p></div>"|17269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17269-the-studio-albums-1968-1979/|8.0|Jessica Hopper

As America's finest living Canadian songwriter (tied with Neil Young), few musicians have understood its nature so well. In the 1960s and 70s, Mitchell was Mary Magdalene to Dylan's folk-rock messiah, making music that was bittersweet and relatable, carrying what Dylan begat even further. Her work helped birth a new idiom that was personal and poetic, creating a new space for songs that made artistic statements, unbound by cliché and tradition. Such was the strength of her music that Mitchell's lyrics didn't have to make sense. But they did, particularly to women.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell's first 10 studio albums, cut during an 11-year span, have been gathered in this import box set. During this run, Mitchell charted one of the most solid career arcs in contemporary music that then detoured into one of the strangest, following her muse into places that very nearly cost her career and exhausted her fanbase's patience. Throughout, she was confident and unrepentant in her vision, in an era where that kind of ego was unbefitting a woman, even if she did have the gold albums and Grammys™ to back it up. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is a basic set-- no frills, just all the albums' original layouts reproduced in envelope sleeves, the fonts so tiny only mice could read them. There are no extras, outtakes or re-anythinged. But taking these 10 records in a row, chronologically, it is a striking reminder no single artist has had a run like Joni (even her acolyte Prince only got to seven albums before he started to fall off). Mitchell was pop's first female auteur, an innovator of singular talent, whose influence was vast, immediate (see: Led Zeppelin's ""Going to California"") and long lasting (Joanna Newsom, St. Vincent, Taylor Swift's kiss'n'tell cottage industry).</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell was ""discovered"" c. 1968 when ex-Byrd David Crosby pulled up in a sailboat outside the Florida club she was playing and took her to L.A. At the time, folk was out of fashion yet Mitchell managed to pull down an unprecedented major label deal for a girl and her guitar: total and complete artistic freedom, with the caveat that Crosby would produce her first album. It was rare for a woman to be writing and recording her own material at the time, let alone to be an unaccompanied solo act. Though Mitchell's debut, <b><i>Song to a Seagull</i></b>, was a heavy precedent for the era it's a harder listen now, the fin de siècle earth-mama lyrics playing strange against the stilted, formal musical settings. The delicate album suffers under Crosby's intrusive production; Mitchell would self-produce from then on. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Clouds</i></b> (1969) is the introduction to Mitchell's real deal, shaking folk tradition and giving off a little humor and spirit. The album sounds <i>casual</i>. Lyrically, she was transitioning from the era's de facto hippie sensualism (colors! the weather! vibes!) to the classically prosodic style (Keats! Cohen!) she'd become known for. The album's biggest signs of life are two of her most famous songs-- the kicky ""Chelsea Morning"", which is about as straightforward as Mitchell ever got, and ""Both Sides Now"". Though she'd known burden and heartache plenty by her still-tender age (she'd borne a child alone and in secret after dropping out of art school and married singer Chuck Mitchell in order to make a family; he changed his mind a month later and she put the baby up for adoption) she sounds a bit too young and chipper to be singing about disillusionment. Still, <i>Clouds</i> was a landmark, and she landed a Grammy for Best Folk Performance.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Ladies of the Canyon</i></b> from 1970 is Mitchell's most accessible album and it introduces her earnest folk-pop style. Her voice is newly elastic and expressive, and it's the first record where she sounds like she might actually be fun to hang out with. <i>Ladies </i>also features her generation-defining ""Woodstock"", ""The Circle Game"" (Mitchell's answer back to Neil Young's nostalgic ""Sugar Mountain""), and her blustery gentrification sing-along, ""Big Yellow Taxi"". All were hippie-era sing-along staples; it hardly bears remarking that these songs are some of Mitchell's corniest. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The genius of <i>Ladies </i>is often circumscribed by Mitchell's proximity to CSNY; the vocal arrangement and production invariably propped to Crosby's influence, ""Woodstock"" supposedly inspired by Nash's recounting of the event (she wrote it before he'd even returned from the festival). If <i>Ladies</i> does bear the mark of CSNY, it's to the album's detriment. The fruits of the Nash/Mitchell romance-- his gee-whiz domestic ode, ""Our House"" and <i>Ladies</i>' ""Willy""-- are saccharine at best. Their subsequent break up would inspire much more potent work-- Neil Young's ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and Mitchell's follow-up. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">About that follow-up: 1971's <b><i>Blue</i></b> is possibly the most gutting break-up album ever made. After Mitchell's relationship with Nash dissolved, she headed to Europe to lose the tether of her fame, eventually taking exile in a cave on the Greek island Crete. The trip would inspire the how-Joni-got-her-groove-back ditties ""Carey"" and ""California"". The album is suffused with melancholy for all that is missing: her daughter (""Little Green""), innocence (""The Last Time I Saw Richard""), and connection (""All I Want""). Mitchell bleeds diffidence and highlights it with spare notes plucked out on her Appalachian dulcimer. While her pals Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and Laura Nyro were also pushing the singer-songwriter genre forward, none of them managed to stride the distance that Mitchell did here in a single album.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">""Will you take me as I am/ Strung out on another man?"" Mitchell pleads on ""California"". She was (in)famously strung out on other talents that were as mercurial as hers, fueling constant speculation as to whether this song was about Leonard Cohen, or that one about James Taylor or Nash or that puerile heartbreaker Jackson Browne. The year Mitchell issued <i>Blue</i>, an album that would be a landmark in any artist's career, Rolling Stone named her ""Old Lady of the Year,"" a dismissal effectively saying her import was as a girlfriend or muse to the men around her more than as an artist in her own right. Worse still, they called her ""Queen of El Lay,"" and offered a diagram of her supposed affairs and conquests. She'd made the best album of her career and in exchange she got slut-shamed in the biggest music magazine in America. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell retired to her homestead in Canada and returned sounding confident for 1972's <b><i>For the Roses</i></b>. Up until <i>Roses </i>she'd kept things minimal, here she stacked multi-tracks of impossible vocals harmonies, mimicking a horn section (""Let the Wind Carry Me"") or interpolating and dueling with jazzer sideman Tom Scott's riffing woodwinds. Mitchell's vocals, fluttering unpredictably and with stunning control between the bottom of her range and the top of her crystalline contralto, were given a new stop; her heavy smoking had given her a heretofore non-existent midrange. There's really no singing along with <i>Roses</i>--  which is a fabulous fuck-you for a pop artist.</span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though part of the reason that she'd retired from performing in 1969 was to avoid the default of writing about the myopic rock'n'roll life, <i>Roses</i>' standout track, ""Blonde in the Bleachers"", shows that she may have understood it better than any of the boys; it is one of the best songs ever written about the rules and (gender) roles of the road. ""It seems like you've got to give up/ Such a piece of your soul /When you give up the chase,"" she sings, about finding identity and meaning in who you fuck. Freedom is an evergreen subject for Mitchell, but ""Blonde in the Bleachers"" gets beyond the thrill in partaking of what-- or, rather, who-- is offered up, backstage. The quiet story here is the ebbing power of a woman once she's been conquered.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell was criticized for not making blatantly feminist or political (read: sloganeering) albums, her work was always tacitly so. Her songs spotlight the unspoken roles of women (""Barandgrill""), who they were <i>unrelated</i> to men; she gave them names and precise details. There is hardly a more feminist topic than striving for a freedom that life and love has never allowed you. On ""Woman of Heart and Mind"", it's hard to tell whether she is mocking herself or the man she is singing to (or both): ""Push your papers/ Win your medals/ Fuck your strangers/ Don't it leave you on the empty side /I'm looking for affection and respect."" On <i>Roses</i>, Mitchell sounds like a woman who's had enough of everyone else's shit, an attitude that certainly put her in line with the libbers.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Her 1974 commercial break-out, <b><i>Court and Spark</i></b>, found her backed by first-call jazz session cats L.A. Express. It was her official severance from folk music. <i>Court</i> is her most pop album and gave her three chart hits, going gold five weeks after its release. Mitchell's production features heavy and sudden multi-tracked swells of her voice that spike melodies like a choir of accusing angels and mimic strings and horns. Her arrangement on ""Down to You"" (aided by Express bandleader Tom Scott) is stunning in its complexity, yet it never shakes you; it is still utterly a pop song. </span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Now six albums deep on the topic of love and loss, <i>Court</i> has a marked cynicism. It's a grown up album about arriving at the intractable issues of adult love. ""Help Me"", which was Mitchell's only top 10 hit, is reluctant about romance; she's ""hoping for the future/ And worrying about the past."" The refrain is pocked by the dawnlight realizations of that post-free love era: ""We love our lovin'/ But not like we love our freedom."" For the largeness of her band (which included Joe Sample of the Crusaders, and Larry Carlton, soon to be of every memorable Steely Dan guitar solo) they are nimble throughout; their finesse suited her own. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">To explain how and what happened next in Mitchell's career-- how much her <i>The Hissing of Summer Lawns</i> was viewed as not a stylistic departure but a <i>betrayal</i>-- we must first look at the run up.

<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The genius of <i>Ladies </i>is often circumscribed by Mitchell's proximity to CSNY; the vocal arrangement and production invariably propped to Crosby's influence, ""Woodstock"" supposedly inspired by Nash's recounting of the event (she wrote it before he'd even returned from the festival). If <i>Ladies</i> does bear the mark of CSNY, it's to the album's detriment. The fruits of the Nash/Mitchell romance-- his gee-whiz domestic ode, ""Our House"" and <i>Ladies</i>' ""Willy""-- are saccharine at best. Their subsequent break up would inspire much more potent work-- Neil Young's ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and Mitchell's follow-up. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">About that follow-up: 1971's <b><i>Blue</i></b> is possibly the most gutting break-up album ever made. After Mitchell's relationship with Nash dissolved, she headed to Europe to lose the tether of her fame, eventually taking exile in a cave on the Greek island Crete. The trip would inspire the how-Joni-got-her-groove-back ditties ""Carey"" and ""California"". The album is suffused with melancholy for all that is missing: her daughter (""Little Green""), innocence (""The Last Time I Saw Richard""), and connection (""All I Want""). Mitchell bleeds diffidence and highlights it with spare notes plucked out on her Appalachian dulcimer. While her pals Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and Laura Nyro were also pushing the singer-songwriter genre forward, none of them managed to stride the distance that Mitchell did here in a single album.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">""Will you take me as I am/ Strung out on another man?"" Mitchell pleads on ""California"". She was (in)famously strung out on other talents that were as mercurial as hers, fueling constant speculation as to whether this song was about Leonard Cohen, or that one about James Taylor or Nash or that puerile heartbreaker Jackson Browne. The year Mitchell issued <i>Blue</i>, an album that would be a landmark in any artist's career, Rolling Stone named her ""Old Lady of the Year,"" a dismissal effectively saying her import was as a girlfriend or muse to the men around her more than as an artist in her own right. Worse still, they called her ""Queen of El Lay,"" and offered a diagram of her supposed affairs and conquests. She'd made the best album of her career and in exchange she got slut-shamed in the biggest music magazine in America. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell retired to her homestead in Canada and returned sounding confident for 1972's <b><i>For the Roses</i></b>. Up until <i>Roses </i>she'd kept things minimal, here she stacked multi-tracks of impossible vocals harmonies, mimicking a horn section (""Let the Wind Carry Me"") or interpolating and dueling with jazzer sideman Tom Scott's riffing woodwinds. Mitchell's vocals, fluttering unpredictably and with stunning control between the bottom of her range and the top of her crystalline contralto, were given a new stop; her heavy smoking had given her a heretofore non-existent midrange. There's really no singing along with <i>Roses</i>--  which is a fabulous fuck-you for a pop artist.</span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though part of the reason that she'd retired from performing in 1969 was to avoid the default of writing about the myopic rock'n'roll life, <i>Roses</i>' standout track, ""Blonde in the Bleachers"", shows that she may have understood it better than any of the boys; it is one of the best songs ever written about the rules and (gender) roles of the road. ""It seems like you've got to give up/ Such a piece of your soul /When you give up the chase,"" she sings, about finding identity and meaning in who you fuck. Freedom is an evergreen subject for Mitchell, but ""Blonde in the Bleachers"" gets beyond the thrill in partaking of what-- or, rather, who-- is offered up, backstage. The quiet story here is the ebbing power of a woman once she's been conquered.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell was criticized for not making blatantly feminist or political (read: sloganeering) albums, her work was always tacitly so. Her songs spotlight the unspoken roles of women (""Barandgrill""), who they were <i>unrelated</i> to men; she gave them names and precise details. There is hardly a more feminist topic than striving for a freedom that life and love has never allowed you. On ""Woman of Heart and Mind"", it's hard to tell whether she is mocking herself or the man she is singing to (or both): ""Push your papers/ Win your medals/ Fuck your strangers/ Don't it leave you on the empty side /I'm looking for affection and respect."" On <i>Roses</i>, Mitchell sounds like a woman who's had enough of everyone else's shit, an attitude that certainly put her in line with the libbers.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Her 1974 commercial break-out, <b><i>Court and Spark</i></b>, found her backed by first-call jazz session cats L.A. Express. It was her official severance from folk music. <i>Court</i> is her most pop album and gave her three chart hits, going gold five weeks after its release. Mitchell's production features heavy and sudden multi-tracked swells of her voice that spike melodies like a choir of accusing angels and mimic strings and horns. Her arrangement on ""Down to You"" (aided by Express bandleader Tom Scott) is stunning in its complexity, yet it never shakes you; it is still utterly a pop song. </span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Now six albums deep on the topic of love and loss, <i>Court</i> has a marked cynicism. It's a grown up album about arriving at the intractable issues of adult love. ""Help Me"", which was Mitchell's only top 10 hit, is reluctant about romance; she's ""hoping for the future/ And worrying about the past."" The refrain is pocked by the dawnlight realizations of that post-free love era: ""We love our lovin'/ But not like we love our freedom."" For the largeness of her band (which included Joe Sample of the Crusaders, and Larry Carlton, soon to be of every memorable Steely Dan guitar solo) they are nimble throughout; their finesse suited her own. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">To explain how and what happened next in Mitchell's career-- how much her <i>The Hissing of Summer Lawns</i> was viewed as not a stylistic departure but a <i>betrayal</i>-- we must first look at the run up. While promoting <i>Court</i>, what could easily be defined as the commercial and artistic high-water mark of her career, Mitchell went to go see Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour and wound up joining. At the time, she was a peer of Dylan, commercially and as a songwriter, she was also tight with tour member Robbie Robertson of the Band. She had a song in the Billboard Top 10-- <i>and she was opening</i>. When Mitchell recounts this in later interviews, she talks about how being on the tour was a matter of constantly having to subvert her ego to the men around her. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">At this same time, many of her peers were headed further toward the mainstream, towards syncopation, towards rock, towards retro revivalism. Mitchell saw there was not much of a place for her amongst the new talents and the Peter Pan-ing crew she came up with, as a woman in her early 30s, and she saw jazz as a genre that would allow her to age gracefully and expand as an artist-- and so there she went. She was trying to find or develop a place to belong. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Through all of this she arrived at <i><b>Hissing of Summer Lawns</b>.</i></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The 1975 album marks Mitchell's official departure from the mainstream, her embarking upon her jazzbo journey. It's the album of an artist absolutely assured of herself, and it's addressed to anyone who might not consider her a <i>serious</i> musician, who believed all she could do was confess her heartache. Though it doesn't have the rhapsodic rep as <i>Blue</i>, it's unquestionably one of Mitchell's finest albums, and it is certainly her most timeless. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">It opens easy enough with ""In France They Kiss on Main Street""-- a soft, linear move from <i>Court</i>. What follows is jarring if you were expecting more of the same: ""The Jungle Line"" runs over a distorting sample of the Royal Drummers of Burundi tribal pounding and chanting. Mitchell going from husky to her enunciation so precise about ""the mathematic circuits of the modern nights,"" the long, low whirring of a Moog running the melody line under Mitchell's acoustic strumming. The rest of the record is dark, tense, and lilts unapologetically toward something softer and more ornate than jazz fusion (no more than the later Steely Dan records it predated) with Mitchell singing observationally, about the place of women in the world, about the trade-offs they make for power and freedom. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell and women of her generation had been brought up with the idea that marriage to a man who took care of them would fulfill them entirely and that ambitions beyond that were frivolous. The album is a reckoning reflective of culture at the time; <i>Hissing </i>is an album of women trying to find their real selves in a world that had groomed them for quiet obeisance to men. On ""Harry's House"" Mitchell sings of a curdling domestic scene, of wives who ""paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid."" The song dovetails into the standard ""Centerpiece"", which she sings in a voice not her own, playacting with this ultra-feminine throwback voice, creating a critical distance when she sings the lines: ""I'm building all my dreams around you/ Our happiness will never cease/ 'Cause nothing's any good without you/ Baby you're my centerpiece.""<i> </i>And on the subtlety devastating ""Sweet Bird"", she sings of women wielding power through beauty and youth, and what is lost and gained in that bargaining: ""Power ideals and beauty/ Fading in everyone's hand"" and ""Calendars of our lives/ Circled with compromise.""</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell had never made a record that wasn't bigger than the one before and was shocked that her fans and many critics saw her new sound as an abandonment and misguided move, respectively. Reviewers chastised her for her ego. While the album went gold and brought her a Grammy nod, as her 1974 live album <i>Miles of Aisles</i> attests (a wonky fiasco, skip it) there were still plenty of people shouting for ""Big Yellow Taxi"". But that Joni didn't live here anymore. <i>Hissing</i> was proof. The era of Mitchell doing no wrong was over and if her audience couldn't hang, she wasn't about to do anything to reel them back in.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The two albums that followed are where Mitchell went off the grid. <i><b>Hejira</b>,</i> from 1976, was written while driving alone from Maine to L.A. and is a meditation on the value and melancholy of being alone, her guitar imitating the rhythms and expanse of the road. In spots it's as emotionally bare as <i>Blue</i>. It's a real <i>grown woman</i> album and may not make tremendous sense to anyone under 30. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Musically, Mitchell says she was trying to see how far she could get from traditional rhythm; the songs are long and lovely, burbling and unspooling. Whether or not you feel this era of Mitchell is unfairly maligned depends on how you feel about Jaco Pastorious and his fretless bass and its many, many notes fardling way up high in the mix. His playing lends a darkly cinematic feeling to the album, but in the decades since his trademark sound and style have been taken to such unpleasant extremes by jam and light jazz bands, it's understandable to experience a visceral revulsion.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Inspired by the rhythms of Brazilian music, Mitchell issued the experimental double-album <b><i>Don Juan's Reckless Daughter</i></b> in '77. Her experiments went further than just musical; she appears in brownface and an afro wig as a man on the cover. Less commented on is her in ""injun"" costume on the back, palm raised, a bubble above her head reads ""How!"" (Her cringe-inducing arguments about it later on included statements about how she has a ""black man's soul""). The album is <i>solidly</i> jazz-fusion, indulgent in length with still plenty of Jaco-dominance. But! there is reward in the album's centerpiece, if you can make it that far: The 16-minute ""Paprika Plains"" is a freakout of a song suite, inspired in part by a conversation with prickly ol' Bob Dylan. Even if you cannot abide by the album, we must be grateful for it, as it is Bjork's #1 favorite album and source of inspiration. The last piece in the box, <b><i>Mingus</i></b>, her 1979 collaboration with Charles Mingus before his death makes her seem like the jazz dilettante that people accused her of being. The ultimate result doesn't serve either of their legacies particularly well.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell's weird escapade through pop doesn't end where the box set does, she never recaptured the thread of popular imagination. Her 80s albums, like many of her hippie-era peers', were overbearing and scolding and featured awkward embraces of technology. She retired for long stretches to focus on her painting. Her last good record was 2000's <i>Both Sides Now</i>, where, her range ravaged by decades of smoking, she sings the definitive version of the titular song that launched her career and finally sounds like she's seen enough to know. </span></p></div>"|17269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17269-the-studio-albums-1968-1979/|7.0|Jessica Hopper

As America's finest living Canadian songwriter (tied with Neil Young), few musicians have understood its nature so well. In the 1960s and 70s, Mitchell was Mary Magdalene to Dylan's folk-rock messiah, making music that was bittersweet and relatable, carrying what Dylan begat even further. Her work helped birth a new idiom that was personal and poetic, creating a new space for songs that made artistic statements, unbound by cliché and tradition. Such was the strength of her music that Mitchell's lyrics didn't have to make sense. But they did, particularly to women.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell's first 10 studio albums, cut during an 11-year span, have been gathered in this import box set. During this run, Mitchell charted one of the most solid career arcs in contemporary music that then detoured into one of the strangest, following her muse into places that very nearly cost her career and exhausted her fanbase's patience. Throughout, she was confident and unrepentant in her vision, in an era where that kind of ego was unbefitting a woman, even if she did have the gold albums and Grammys™ to back it up. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is a basic set-- no frills, just all the albums' original layouts reproduced in envelope sleeves, the fonts so tiny only mice could read them. There are no extras, outtakes or re-anythinged. But taking these 10 records in a row, chronologically, it is a striking reminder no single artist has had a run like Joni (even her acolyte Prince only got to seven albums before he started to fall off). Mitchell was pop's first female auteur, an innovator of singular talent, whose influence was vast, immediate (see: Led Zeppelin's ""Going to California"") and long lasting (Joanna Newsom, St. Vincent, Taylor Swift's kiss'n'tell cottage industry).</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell was ""discovered"" c. 1968 when ex-Byrd David Crosby pulled up in a sailboat outside the Florida club she was playing and took her to L.A. At the time, folk was out of fashion yet Mitchell managed to pull down an unprecedented major label deal for a girl and her guitar: total and complete artistic freedom, with the caveat that Crosby would produce her first album. It was rare for a woman to be writing and recording her own material at the time, let alone to be an unaccompanied solo act. Though Mitchell's debut, <b><i>Song to a Seagull</i></b>, was a heavy precedent for the era it's a harder listen now, the fin de siècle earth-mama lyrics playing strange against the stilted, formal musical settings. The delicate album suffers under Crosby's intrusive production; Mitchell would self-produce from then on. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Clouds</i></b> (1969) is the introduction to Mitchell's real deal, shaking folk tradition and giving off a little humor and spirit. The album sounds <i>casual</i>. Lyrically, she was transitioning from the era's de facto hippie sensualism (colors! the weather! vibes!) to the classically prosodic style (Keats! Cohen!) she'd become known for. The album's biggest signs of life are two of her most famous songs-- the kicky ""Chelsea Morning"", which is about as straightforward as Mitchell ever got, and ""Both Sides Now"". Though she'd known burden and heartache plenty by her still-tender age (she'd borne a child alone and in secret after dropping out of art school and married singer Chuck Mitchell in order to make a family; he changed his mind a month later and she put the baby up for adoption) she sounds a bit too young and chipper to be singing about disillusionment. Still, <i>Clouds</i> was a landmark, and she landed a Grammy for Best Folk Performance.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Ladies of the Canyon</i></b> from 1970 is Mitchell's most accessible album and it introduces her earnest folk-pop style. Her voice is newly elastic and expressive, and it's the first record where she sounds like she might actually be fun to hang out with. <i>Ladies </i>also features her generation-defining ""Woodstock"", ""The Circle Game"" (Mitchell's answer back to Neil Young's nostalgic ""Sugar Mountain""), and her blustery gentrification sing-along, ""Big Yellow Taxi"". All were hippie-era sing-along staples; it hardly bears remarking that these songs are some of Mitchell's corniest. </span></p>

If <i>Ladies</i> does bear the mark of CSNY, it's to the album's detriment. The fruits of the Nash/Mitchell romance-- his gee-whiz domestic ode, ""Our House"" and <i>Ladies</i>' ""Willy""-- are saccharine at best. Their subsequent break up would inspire much more potent work-- Neil Young's ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and Mitchell's follow-up. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">About that follow-up: 1971's <b><i>Blue</i></b> is possibly the most gutting break-up album ever made. After Mitchell's relationship with Nash dissolved, she headed to Europe to lose the tether of her fame, eventually taking exile in a cave on the Greek island Crete.

The last piece in the box, <b><i>Mingus</i></b>, her 1979 collaboration with Charles Mingus before his death makes her seem like the jazz dilettante that people accused her of being. The ultimate result doesn't serve either of their legacies particularly well.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell's weird escapade through pop doesn't end where the box set does, she never recaptured the thread of popular imagination. Her 80s albums, like many of her hippie-era peers', were overbearing and scolding and featured awkward embraces of technology. She retired for long stretches to focus on her painting. Her last good record was 2000's <i>Both Sides Now</i>, where, her range ravaged by decades of smoking, she sings the definitive version of the titular song that launched her career and finally sounds like she's seen enough to know. </span></p></div>"|17269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17269-the-studio-albums-1968-1979/|7.8|Jessica Hopper

As America's finest living Canadian songwriter (tied with Neil Young), few musicians have understood its nature so well. In the 1960s and 70s, Mitchell was Mary Magdalene to Dylan's folk-rock messiah, making music that was bittersweet and relatable, carrying what Dylan begat even further. Her work helped birth a new idiom that was personal and poetic, creating a new space for songs that made artistic statements, unbound by cliché and tradition. Such was the strength of her music that Mitchell's lyrics didn't have to make sense. But they did, particularly to women.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell's first 10 studio albums, cut during an 11-year span, have been gathered in this import box set. During this run, Mitchell charted one of the most solid career arcs in contemporary music that then detoured into one of the strangest, following her muse into places that very nearly cost her career and exhausted her fanbase's patience. Throughout, she was confident and unrepentant in her vision, in an era where that kind of ego was unbefitting a woman, even if she did have the gold albums and Grammys™ to back it up. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is a basic set-- no frills, just all the albums' original layouts reproduced in envelope sleeves, the fonts so tiny only mice could read them. There are no extras, outtakes or re-anythinged. But taking these 10 records in a row, chronologically, it is a striking reminder no single artist has had a run like Joni (even her acolyte Prince only got to seven albums before he started to fall off). Mitchell was pop's first female auteur, an innovator of singular talent, whose influence was vast, immediate (see: Led Zeppelin's ""Going to California"") and long lasting (Joanna Newsom, St. Vincent, Taylor Swift's kiss'n'tell cottage industry).</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell was ""discovered"" c. 1968 when ex-Byrd David Crosby pulled up in a sailboat outside the Florida club she was playing and took her to L.A. At the time, folk was out of fashion yet Mitchell managed to pull down an unprecedented major label deal for a girl and her guitar: total and complete artistic freedom, with the caveat that Crosby would produce her first album. It was rare for a woman to be writing and recording her own material at the time, let alone to be an unaccompanied solo act. Though Mitchell's debut, <b><i>Song to a Seagull</i></b>, was a heavy precedent for the era it's a harder listen now, the fin de siècle earth-mama lyrics playing strange against the stilted, formal musical settings. The delicate album suffers under Crosby's intrusive production; Mitchell would self-produce from then on. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Clouds</i></b> (1969) is the introduction to Mitchell's real deal, shaking folk tradition and giving off a little humor and spirit. The album sounds <i>casual</i>. Lyrically, she was transitioning from the era's de facto hippie sensualism (colors! the weather! vibes!) to the classically prosodic style (Keats! Cohen!) she'd become known for. The album's biggest signs of life are two of her most famous songs-- the kicky ""Chelsea Morning"", which is about as straightforward as Mitchell ever got, and ""Both Sides Now"". Though she'd known burden and heartache plenty by her still-tender age (she'd borne a child alone and in secret after dropping out of art school and married singer Chuck Mitchell in order to make a family; he changed his mind a month later and she put the baby up for adoption) she sounds a bit too young and chipper to be singing about disillusionment. Still, <i>Clouds</i> was a landmark, and she landed a Grammy for Best Folk Performance.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Ladies of the Canyon</i></b> from 1970 is Mitchell's most accessible album and it introduces her earnest folk-pop style. Her voice is newly elastic and expressive, and it's the first record where she sounds like she might actually be fun to hang out with. <i>Ladies </i>also features her generation-defining ""Woodstock"", ""The Circle Game"" (Mitchell's answer back to Neil Young's nostalgic ""Sugar Mountain""), and her blustery gentrification sing-along, ""Big Yellow Taxi"". All were hippie-era sing-along staples; it hardly bears remarking that these songs are some of Mitchell's corniest. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The genius of <i>Ladies </i>is often circumscribed by Mitchell's proximity to CSNY; the vocal arrangement and production invariably propped to Crosby's influence, ""Woodstock"" supposedly inspired by Nash's recounting of the event (she wrote it before he'd even returned from the festival). If <i>Ladies</i> does bear the mark of CSNY, it's to the album's detriment. The fruits of the Nash/Mitchell romance-- his gee-whiz domestic ode, ""Our House"" and <i>Ladies</i>' ""Willy""-- are saccharine at best. Their subsequent break up would inspire much more potent work-- Neil Young's ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and Mitchell's follow-up. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">About that follow-up: 1971's <b><i>Blue</i></b> is possibly the most gutting break-up album ever made. After Mitchell's relationship with Nash dissolved, she headed to Europe to lose the tether of her fame, eventually taking exile in a cave on the Greek island Crete. The trip would inspire the how-Joni-got-her-groove-back ditties ""Carey"" and ""California"". The album is suffused with melancholy for all that is missing: her daughter (""Little Green""), innocence (""The Last Time I Saw Richard""), and connection (""All I Want""). Mitchell bleeds diffidence and highlights it with spare notes plucked out on her Appalachian dulcimer. While her pals Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and Laura Nyro were also pushing the singer-songwriter genre forward, none of them managed to stride the distance that Mitchell did here in a single album.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">""Will you take me as I am/ Strung out on another man?"" Mitchell pleads on ""California"". She was (in)famously strung out on other talents that were as mercurial as hers, fueling constant speculation as to whether this song was about Leonard Cohen, or that one about James Taylor or Nash or that puerile heartbreaker Jackson Browne. The year Mitchell issued <i>Blue</i>, an album that would be a landmark in any artist's career, Rolling Stone named her ""Old Lady of the Year,"" a dismissal effectively saying her import was as a girlfriend or muse to the men around her more than as an artist in her own right. Worse still, they called her ""Queen of El Lay,"" and offered a diagram of her supposed affairs and conquests. She'd made the best album of her career and in exchange she got slut-shamed in the biggest music magazine in America. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell retired to her homestead in Canada and returned sounding confident for 1972's <b><i>For the Roses</i></b>. Up until <i>Roses </i>she'd kept things minimal, here she stacked multi-tracks of impossible vocals harmonies, mimicking a horn section (""Let the Wind Carry Me"") or interpolating and dueling with jazzer sideman Tom Scott's riffing woodwinds. Mitchell's vocals, fluttering unpredictably and with stunning control between the bottom of her range and the top of her crystalline contralto, were given a new stop; her heavy smoking had given her a heretofore non-existent midrange. There's really no singing along with <i>Roses</i>--  which is a fabulous fuck-you for a pop artist.</span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though part of the reason that she'd retired from performing in 1969 was to avoid the default of writing about the myopic rock'n'roll life, <i>Roses</i>' standout track, ""Blonde in the Bleachers"", shows that she may have understood it better than any of the boys; it is one of the best songs ever written about the rules and (gender) roles of the road. ""It seems like you've got to give up/ Such a piece of your soul /When you give up the chase,"" she sings, about finding identity and meaning in who you fuck. Freedom is an evergreen subject for Mitchell, but ""Blonde in the Bleachers"" gets beyond the thrill in partaking of what-- or, rather, who-- is offered up, backstage. The quiet story here is the ebbing power of a woman once she's been conquered.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell was criticized for not making blatantly feminist or political (read: sloganeering) albums, her work was always tacitly so. Her songs spotlight the unspoken roles of women (""Barandgrill""), who they were <i>unrelated</i> to men; she gave them names and precise details. There is hardly a more feminist topic than striving for a freedom that life and love has never allowed you. On ""Woman of Heart and Mind"", it's hard to tell whether she is mocking herself or the man she is singing to (or both): ""Push your papers/ Win your medals/ Fuck your strangers/ Don't it leave you on the empty side /I'm looking for affection and respect."" On <i>Roses</i>, Mitchell sounds like a woman who's had enough of everyone else's shit, an attitude that certainly put her in line with the libbers.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Her 1974 commercial break-out, <b><i>Court and Spark</i></b>, found her backed by first-call jazz session cats L.A. Express. It was her official severance from folk music. <i>Court</i> is her most pop album and gave her three chart hits, going gold five weeks after its release. Mitchell's production features heavy and sudden multi-tracked swells of her voice that spike melodies like a choir of accusing angels and mimic strings and horns. Her arrangement on ""Down to You"" (aided by Express bandleader Tom Scott) is stunning in its complexity, yet it never shakes you; it is still utterly a pop song. </span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Now six albums deep on the topic of love and loss, <i>Court</i> has a marked cynicism. It's a grown up album about arriving at the intractable issues of adult love. ""Help Me"", which was Mitchell's only top 10 hit, is reluctant about romance; she's ""hoping for the future/ And worrying about the past."" The refrain is pocked by the dawnlight realizations of that post-free love era: ""We love our lovin'/ But not like we love our freedom."" For the largeness of her band (which included Joe Sample of the Crusaders, and Larry Carlton, soon to be of every memorable Steely Dan guitar solo) they are nimble throughout; their finesse suited her own. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">To explain how and what happened next in Mitchell's career-- how much her <i>The Hissing of Summer Lawns</i> was viewed as not a stylistic departure but a <i>betrayal</i>-- we must first look at the run up. While promoting <i>Court</i>, what could easily be defined as the commercial and artistic high-water mark of her career, Mitchell went to go see Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour and wound up joining. At the time, she was a peer of Dylan, commercially and as a songwriter, she was also tight with tour member Robbie Robertson of the Band. She had a song in the Billboard Top 10-- <i>and she was opening</i>. When Mitchell recounts this in later interviews, she talks about how being on the tour was a matter of constantly having to subvert her ego to the men around her. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">At this same time, many of her peers were headed further toward the mainstream, towards syncopation, towards rock, towards retro revivalism. Mitchell saw there was not much of a place for her amongst the new talents and the Peter Pan-ing crew she came up with, as a woman in her early 30s, and she saw jazz as a genre that would allow her to age gracefully and expand as an artist-- and so there she went. She was trying to find or develop a place to belong. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Through all of this she arrived at <i><b>Hissing of Summer Lawns</b>.</i></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The 1975 album marks Mitchell's official departure from the mainstream, her embarking upon her jazzbo journey. It's the album of an artist absolutely assured of herself, and it's addressed to anyone who might not consider her a <i>serious</i> musician, who believed all she could do was confess her heartache. Though it doesn't have the rhapsodic rep as <i>Blue</i>, it's unquestionably one of Mitchell's finest albums, and it is certainly her most timeless. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">It opens easy enough with ""In France They Kiss on Main Street""-- a soft, linear move from <i>Court</i>. What follows is jarring if you were expecting more of the same: ""The Jungle Line"" runs over a distorting sample of the Royal Drummers of Burundi tribal pounding and chanting. Mitchell going from husky to her enunciation so precise about ""the mathematic circuits of the modern nights,"" the long, low whirring of a Moog running the melody line under Mitchell's acoustic strumming. The rest of the record is dark, tense, and lilts unapologetically toward something softer and more ornate than jazz fusion (no more than the later Steely Dan records it predated) with Mitchell singing observationally, about the place of women in the world, about the trade-offs they make for power and freedom. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell and women of her generation had been brought up with the idea that marriage to a man who took care of them would fulfill them entirely and that ambitions beyond that were frivolous. The album is a reckoning reflective of culture at the time; <i>Hissing </i>is an album of women trying to find their real selves in a world that had groomed them for quiet obeisance to men. On ""Harry's House"" Mitchell sings of a curdling domestic scene, of wives who ""paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid."" The song dovetails into the standard ""Centerpiece"", which she sings in a voice not her own, playacting with this ultra-feminine throwback voice, creating a critical distance when she sings the lines: ""I'm building all my dreams around you/ Our happiness will never cease/ 'Cause nothing's any good without you/ Baby you're my centerpiece.""<i> </i>And on the subtlety devastating ""Sweet Bird"", she sings of women wielding power through beauty and youth, and what is lost and gained in that bargaining: ""Power ideals and beauty/ Fading in everyone's hand"" and ""Calendars of our lives/ Circled with compromise.""</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell had never made a record that wasn't bigger than the one before and was shocked that her fans and many critics saw her new sound as an abandonment and misguided move, respectively. Reviewers chastised her for her ego. While the album went gold and brought her a Grammy nod, as her 1974 live album <i>Miles of Aisles</i> attests (a wonky fiasco, skip it) there were still plenty of people shouting for ""Big Yellow Taxi"". But that Joni didn't live here anymore. <i>Hissing</i> was proof. The era of Mitchell doing no wrong was over and if her audience couldn't hang, she wasn't about to do anything to reel them back in.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The two albums that followed are where Mitchell went off the grid. <i><b>Hejira</b>,</i> from 1976, was written while driving alone from Maine to L.A. and is a meditation on the value and melancholy of being alone, her guitar imitating the rhythms and expanse of the road. In spots it's as emotionally bare as <i>Blue</i>. It's a real <i>grown woman</i> album and may not make tremendous sense to anyone under 30. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Musically, Mitchell says she was trying to see how far she could get from traditional rhythm; the songs are long and lovely, burbling and unspooling. Whether or not you feel this era of Mitchell is unfairly maligned depends on how you feel about Jaco Pastorious and his fretless bass and its many, many notes fardling way up high in the mix. His playing lends a darkly cinematic feeling to the album, but in the decades since his trademark sound and style have been taken to such unpleasant extremes by jam and light jazz bands, it's understandable to experience a visceral revulsion.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Inspired by the rhythms of Brazilian music, Mitchell issued the experimental double-album <b><i>Don Juan's Reckless Daughter</i></b> in '77. Her experiments went further than just musical; she appears in brownface and an afro wig as a man on the cover. Less commented on is her in ""injun"" costume on the back, palm raised, a bubble above her head reads ""How!"" (Her cringe-inducing arguments about it later on included statements about how she has a ""black man's soul""). The album is <i>solidly</i> jazz-fusion, indulgent in length with still plenty of Jaco-dominance. But! there is reward in the album's centerpiece, if you can make it that far: The 16-minute ""Paprika Plains"" is a freakout of a song suite, inspired in part by a conversation with prickly ol' Bob Dylan. Even if you cannot abide by the album, we must be grateful for it, as it is Bjork's #1 favorite album and source of inspiration. The last piece in the box, <b><i>Mingus</i></b>, her 1979 collaboration with Charles Mingus before his death makes her seem like the jazz dilettante that people accused her of being. The ultimate result doesn't serve either of their legacies particularly well.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell's weird escapade through pop doesn't end where the box set does, she never recaptured the thread of popular imagination. Her 80s albums, like many of her hippie-era peers', were overbearing and scolding and featured awkward embraces of technology. She retired for long stretches to focus on her painting. Her last good record was 2000's <i>Both Sides Now</i>, where, her range ravaged by decades of smoking, she sings the definitive version of the titular song that launched her career and finally sounds like she's seen enough to know. </span></p></div>"|17269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17269-the-studio-albums-1968-1979/|10.0|Jessica Hopper

When Mitchell recounts this in later interviews, she talks about how being on the tour was a matter of constantly having to subvert her ego to the men around her. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">At this same time, many of her peers were headed further toward the mainstream, towards syncopation, towards rock, towards retro revivalism. Mitchell saw there was not much of a place for her amongst the new talents and the Peter Pan-ing crew she came up with, as a woman in her early 30s, and she saw jazz as a genre that would allow her to age gracefully and expand as an artist-- and so there she went. She was trying to find or develop a place to belong. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Through all of this she arrived at <i><b>Hissing of Summer Lawns</b>.</i></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The 1975 album marks Mitchell's official departure from the mainstream, her embarking upon her jazzbo journey. It's the album of an artist absolutely assured of herself, and it's addressed to anyone who might not consider her a <i>serious</i> musician, who believed all she could do was confess her heartache. Though it doesn't have the rhapsodic rep as <i>Blue</i>, it's unquestionably one of Mitchell's finest albums, and it is certainly her most timeless. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">It opens easy enough with ""In France They Kiss on Main Street""-- a soft, linear move from <i>Court</i>. What follows is jarring if you were expecting more of the same: ""The Jungle Line"" runs over a distorting sample of the Royal Drummers of Burundi tribal pounding and chanting. Mitchell going from husky to her enunciation so precise about ""the mathematic circuits of the modern nights,"" the long, low whirring of a Moog running the melody line under Mitchell's acoustic strumming. The rest of the record is dark, tense, and lilts unapologetically toward something softer and more ornate than jazz fusion (no more than the later Steely Dan records it predated) with Mitchell singing observationally, about the place of women in the world, about the trade-offs they make for power and freedom. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell and women of her generation had been brought up with the idea that marriage to a man who took care of them would fulfill them entirely and that ambitions beyond that were frivolous. The album is a reckoning reflective of culture at the time; <i>Hissing </i>is an album of women trying to find their real selves in a world that had groomed them for quiet obeisance to men. On ""Harry's House"" Mitchell sings of a curdling domestic scene, of wives who ""paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid."" The song dovetails into the standard ""Centerpiece"", which she sings in a voice not her own, playacting with this ultra-feminine throwback voice, creating a critical distance when she sings the lines: ""I'm building all my dreams around you/ Our happiness will never cease/ 'Cause nothing's any good without you/ Baby you're my centerpiece.""<i> </i>And on the subtlety devastating ""Sweet Bird"", she sings of women wielding power through beauty and youth, and what is lost and gained in that bargaining: ""Power ideals and beauty/ Fading in everyone's hand"" and ""Calendars of our lives/ Circled with compromise.""</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell had never made a record that wasn't bigger than the one before and was shocked that her fans and many critics saw her new sound as an abandonment and misguided move, respectively. Reviewers chastised her for her ego. While the album went gold and brought her a Grammy nod, as her 1974 live album <i>Miles of Aisles</i> attests (a wonky fiasco, skip it) there were still plenty of people shouting for ""Big Yellow Taxi"". But that Joni didn't live here anymore. <i>Hissing</i> was proof. The era of Mitchell doing no wrong was over and if her audience couldn't hang, she wasn't about to do anything to reel them back in.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The two albums that followed are where Mitchell went off the grid. <i><b>Hejira</b>,</i> from 1976, was written while driving alone from Maine to L.A. and is a meditation on the value and melancholy of being alone, her guitar imitating the rhythms and expanse of the road. In spots it's as emotionally bare as <i>Blue</i>. It's a real <i>grown woman</i> album and may not make tremendous sense to anyone under 30. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Musically, Mitchell says she was trying to see how far she could get from traditional rhythm; the songs are long and lovely, burbling and unspooling. Whether or not you feel this era of Mitchell is unfairly maligned depends on how you feel about Jaco Pastorious and his fretless bass and its many, many notes fardling way up high in the mix. His playing lends a darkly cinematic feeling to the album, but in the decades since his trademark sound and style have been taken to such unpleasant extremes by jam and light jazz bands, it's understandable to experience a visceral revulsion.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Inspired by the rhythms of Brazilian music, Mitchell issued the experimental double-album <b><i>Don Juan's Reckless Daughter</i></b> in '77. Her experiments went further than just musical; she appears in brownface and an afro wig as a man on the cover. Less commented on is her in ""injun"" costume on the back, palm raised, a bubble above her head reads ""How!"" (Her cringe-inducing arguments about it later on included statements about how she has a ""black man's soul""). The album is <i>solidly</i> jazz-fusion, indulgent in length with still plenty of Jaco-dominance. But! there is reward in the album's centerpiece, if you can make it that far: The 16-minute ""Paprika Plains"" is a freakout of a song suite, inspired in part by a conversation with prickly ol' Bob Dylan. Even if you cannot abide by the album, we must be grateful for it, as it is Bjork's #1 favorite album and source of inspiration. The last piece in the box, <b><i>Mingus</i></b>, her 1979 collaboration with Charles Mingus before his death makes her seem like the jazz dilettante that people accused her of being. The ultimate result doesn't serve either of their legacies particularly well.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell's weird escapade through pop doesn't end where the box set does, she never recaptured the thread of popular imagination. Her 80s albums, like many of her hippie-era peers', were overbearing and scolding and featured awkward embraces of technology. She retired for long stretches to focus on her painting. Her last good record was 2000's <i>Both Sides Now</i>, where, her range ravaged by decades of smoking, she sings the definitive version of the titular song that launched her career and finally sounds like she's seen enough to know. </span></p></div>"|17269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17269-the-studio-albums-1968-1979/|9.1|Jessica Hopper

As America's finest living Canadian songwriter (tied with Neil Young), few musicians have understood its nature so well. In the 1960s and 70s, Mitchell was Mary Magdalene to Dylan's folk-rock messiah, making music that was bittersweet and relatable, carrying what Dylan begat even further. Her work helped birth a new idiom that was personal and poetic, creating a new space for songs that made artistic statements, unbound by cliché and tradition. Such was the strength of her music that Mitchell's lyrics didn't have to make sense. But they did, particularly to women.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell's first 10 studio albums, cut during an 11-year span, have been gathered in this import box set. During this run, Mitchell charted one of the most solid career arcs in contemporary music that then detoured into one of the strangest, following her muse into places that very nearly cost her career and exhausted her fanbase's patience. Throughout, she was confident and unrepentant in her vision, in an era where that kind of ego was unbefitting a woman, even if she did have the gold albums and Grammys™ to back it up. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is a basic set-- no frills, just all the albums' original layouts reproduced in envelope sleeves, the fonts so tiny only mice could read them. There are no extras, outtakes or re-anythinged. But taking these 10 records in a row, chronologically, it is a striking reminder no single artist has had a run like Joni (even her acolyte Prince only got to seven albums before he started to fall off). Mitchell was pop's first female auteur, an innovator of singular talent, whose influence was vast, immediate (see: Led Zeppelin's ""Going to California"") and long lasting (Joanna Newsom, St. Vincent, Taylor Swift's kiss'n'tell cottage industry).</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell was ""discovered"" c. 1968 when ex-Byrd David Crosby pulled up in a sailboat outside the Florida club she was playing and took her to L.A. At the time, folk was out of fashion yet Mitchell managed to pull down an unprecedented major label deal for a girl and her guitar: total and complete artistic freedom, with the caveat that Crosby would produce her first album. It was rare for a woman to be writing and recording her own material at the time, let alone to be an unaccompanied solo act. Though Mitchell's debut, <b><i>Song to a Seagull</i></b>, was a heavy precedent for the era it's a harder listen now, the fin de siècle earth-mama lyrics playing strange against the stilted, formal musical settings. The delicate album suffers under Crosby's intrusive production; Mitchell would self-produce from then on. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Clouds</i></b> (1969) is the introduction to Mitchell's real deal, shaking folk tradition and giving off a little humor and spirit. The album sounds <i>casual</i>. Lyrically, she was transitioning from the era's de facto hippie sensualism (colors! the weather! vibes!) to the classically prosodic style (Keats! Cohen!) she'd become known for. The album's biggest signs of life are two of her most famous songs-- the kicky ""Chelsea Morning"", which is about as straightforward as Mitchell ever got, and ""Both Sides Now"". Though she'd known burden and heartache plenty by her still-tender age (she'd borne a child alone and in secret after dropping out of art school and married singer Chuck Mitchell in order to make a family; he changed his mind a month later and she put the baby up for adoption) she sounds a bit too young and chipper to be singing about disillusionment. Still, <i>Clouds</i> was a landmark, and she landed a Grammy for Best Folk Performance.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Ladies of the Canyon</i></b> from 1970 is Mitchell's most accessible album and it introduces her earnest folk-pop style. Her voice is newly elastic and expressive, and it's the first record where she sounds like she might actually be fun to hang out with. <i>Ladies </i>also features her generation-defining ""Woodstock"", ""The Circle Game"" (Mitchell's answer back to Neil Young's nostalgic ""Sugar Mountain""), and her blustery gentrification sing-along, ""Big Yellow Taxi"". All were hippie-era sing-along staples; it hardly bears remarking that these songs are some of Mitchell's corniest. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The genius of <i>Ladies </i>is often circumscribed by Mitchell's proximity to CSNY; the vocal arrangement and production invariably propped to Crosby's influence, ""Woodstock"" supposedly inspired by Nash's recounting of the event (she wrote it before he'd even returned from the festival). If <i>Ladies</i> does bear the mark of CSNY, it's to the album's detriment. The fruits of the Nash/Mitchell romance-- his gee-whiz domestic ode, ""Our House"" and <i>Ladies</i>' ""Willy""-- are saccharine at best. Their subsequent break up would inspire much more potent work-- Neil Young's ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and Mitchell's follow-up. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">About that follow-up: 1971's <b><i>Blue</i></b> is possibly the most gutting break-up album ever made. After Mitchell's relationship with Nash dissolved, she headed to Europe to lose the tether of her fame, eventually taking exile in a cave on the Greek island Crete. The trip would inspire the how-Joni-got-her-groove-back ditties ""Carey"" and ""California"". The album is suffused with melancholy for all that is missing: her daughter (""Little Green""), innocence (""The Last Time I Saw Richard""), and connection (""All I Want""). Mitchell bleeds diffidence and highlights it with spare notes plucked out on her Appalachian dulcimer. While her pals Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and Laura Nyro were also pushing the singer-songwriter genre forward, none of them managed to stride the distance that Mitchell did here in a single album.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">""Will you take me as I am/ Strung out on another man?"" Mitchell pleads on ""California"". She was (in)famously strung out on other talents that were as mercurial as hers, fueling constant speculation as to whether this song was about Leonard Cohen, or that one about James Taylor or Nash or that puerile heartbreaker Jackson Browne. The year Mitchell issued <i>Blue</i>, an album that would be a landmark in any artist's career, Rolling Stone named her ""Old Lady of the Year,"" a dismissal effectively saying her import was as a girlfriend or muse to the men around her more than as an artist in her own right. Worse still, they called her ""Queen of El Lay,"" and offered a diagram of her supposed affairs and conquests. She'd made the best album of her career and in exchange she got slut-shamed in the biggest music magazine in America. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell retired to her homestead in Canada and returned sounding confident for 1972's <b><i>For the Roses</i></b>. Up until <i>Roses </i>she'd kept things minimal, here she stacked multi-tracks of impossible vocals harmonies, mimicking a horn section (""Let the Wind Carry Me"") or interpolating and dueling with jazzer sideman Tom Scott's riffing woodwinds. Mitchell's vocals, fluttering unpredictably and with stunning control between the bottom of her range and the top of her crystalline contralto, were given a new stop; her heavy smoking had given her a heretofore non-existent midrange. There's really no singing along with <i>Roses</i>--  which is a fabulous fuck-you for a pop artist.</span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though part of the reason that she'd retired from performing in 1969 was to avoid the default of writing about the myopic rock'n'roll life, <i>Roses</i>' standout track, ""Blonde in the Bleachers"", shows that she may have understood it better than any of the boys; it is one of the best songs ever written about the rules and (gender) roles of the road. ""It seems like you've got to give up/ Such a piece of your soul /When you give up the chase,"" she sings, about finding identity and meaning in who you fuck. Freedom is an evergreen subject for Mitchell, but ""Blonde in the Bleachers"" gets beyond the thrill in partaking of what-- or, rather, who-- is offered up, backstage. The quiet story here is the ebbing power of a woman once she's been conquered.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell was criticized for not making blatantly feminist or political (read: sloganeering) albums, her work was always tacitly so. Her songs spotlight the unspoken roles of women (""Barandgrill""), who they were <i>unrelated</i> to men; she gave them names and precise details. There is hardly a more feminist topic than striving for a freedom that life and love has never allowed you. On ""Woman of Heart and Mind"", it's hard to tell whether she is mocking herself or the man she is singing to (or both): ""Push your papers/ Win your medals/ Fuck your strangers/ Don't it leave you on the empty side /I'm looking for affection and respect."" On <i>Roses</i>, Mitchell sounds like a woman who's had enough of everyone else's shit, an attitude that certainly put her in line with the libbers.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Her 1974 commercial break-out, <b><i>Court and Spark</i></b>, found her backed by first-call jazz session cats L.A. Express. It was her official severance from folk music. <i>Court</i> is her most pop album and gave her three chart hits, going gold five weeks after its release. Mitchell's production features heavy and sudden multi-tracked swells of her voice that spike melodies like a choir of accusing angels and mimic strings and horns. Her arrangement on ""Down to You"" (aided by Express bandleader Tom Scott) is stunning in its complexity, yet it never shakes you; it is still utterly a pop song. </span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Now six albums deep on the topic of love and loss, <i>Court</i> has a marked cynicism. It's a grown up album about arriving at the intractable issues of adult love. ""Help Me"", which was Mitchell's only top 10 hit, is reluctant about romance; she's ""hoping for the future/ And worrying about the past."" The refrain is pocked by the dawnlight realizations of that post-free love era: ""We love our lovin'/ But not like we love our freedom."" For the largeness of her band (which included Joe Sample of the Crusaders, and Larry Carlton, soon to be of every memorable Steely Dan guitar solo) they are nimble throughout; their finesse suited her own. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">To explain how and what happened next in Mitchell's career-- how much her <i>The Hissing of Summer Lawns</i> was viewed as not a stylistic departure but a <i>betrayal</i>-- we must first look at the run up. While promoting <i>Court</i>, what could easily be defined as the commercial and artistic high-water mark of her career, Mitchell went to go see Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour and wound up joining. At the time, she was a peer of Dylan, commercially and as a songwriter, she was also tight with tour member Robbie Robertson of the Band. She had a song in the Billboard Top 10-- <i>and she was opening</i>. When Mitchell recounts this in later interviews, she talks about how being on the tour was a matter of constantly having to subvert her ego to the men around her. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">At this same time, many of her peers were headed further toward the mainstream, towards syncopation, towards rock, towards retro revivalism. Mitchell saw there was not much of a place for her amongst the new talents and the Peter Pan-ing crew she came up with, as a woman in her early 30s, and she saw jazz as a genre that would allow her to age gracefully and expand as an artist-- and so there she went. She was trying to find or develop a place to belong. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Through all of this she arrived at <i><b>Hissing of Summer Lawns</b>.</i></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The 1975 album marks Mitchell's official departure from the mainstream, her embarking upon her jazzbo journey. It's the album of an artist absolutely assured of herself, and it's addressed to anyone who might not consider her a <i>serious</i> musician, who believed all she could do was confess her heartache.

<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">It opens easy enough with ""In France They Kiss on Main Street""-- a soft, linear move from <i>Court</i>.

After Mitchell's relationship with Nash dissolved, she headed to Europe to lose the tether of her fame, eventually taking exile in a cave on the Greek island Crete. The trip would inspire the how-Joni-got-her-groove-back ditties ""Carey"" and ""California"". The album is suffused with melancholy for all that is missing: her daughter (""Little Green""), innocence (""The Last Time I Saw Richard""), and connection (""All I Want""). Mitchell bleeds diffidence and highlights it with spare notes plucked out on her Appalachian dulcimer. While her pals Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and Laura Nyro were also pushing the singer-songwriter genre forward, none of them managed to stride the distance that Mitchell did here in a single album.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">""Will you take me as I am/ Strung out on another man?"" Mitchell pleads on ""California"". She was (in)famously strung out on other talents that were as mercurial as hers, fueling constant speculation as to whether this song was about Leonard Cohen, or that one about James Taylor or Nash or that puerile heartbreaker Jackson Browne. The year Mitchell issued <i>Blue</i>, an album that would be a landmark in any artist's career, Rolling Stone named her ""Old Lady of the Year,"" a dismissal effectively saying her import was as a girlfriend or muse to the men around her more than as an artist in her own right. Worse still, they called her ""Queen of El Lay,"" and offered a diagram of her supposed affairs and conquests. She'd made the best album of her career and in exchange she got slut-shamed in the biggest music magazine in America. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell retired to her homestead in Canada and returned sounding confident for 1972's <b><i>For the Roses</i></b>. Up until <i>Roses </i>she'd kept things minimal, here she stacked multi-tracks of impossible vocals harmonies, mimicking a horn section (""Let the Wind Carry Me"") or interpolating and dueling with jazzer sideman Tom Scott's riffing woodwinds. Mitchell's vocals, fluttering unpredictably and with stunning control between the bottom of her range and the top of her crystalline contralto, were given a new stop; her heavy smoking had given her a heretofore non-existent midrange. There's really no singing along with <i>Roses</i>--  which is a fabulous fuck-you for a pop artist.</span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though part of the reason that she'd retired from performing in 1969 was to avoid the default of writing about the myopic rock'n'roll life, <i>Roses</i>' standout track, ""Blonde in the Bleachers"", shows that she may have understood it better than any of the boys; it is one of the best songs ever written about the rules and (gender) roles of the road. ""It seems like you've got to give up/ Such a piece of your soul /When you give up the chase,"" she sings, about finding identity and meaning in who you fuck. Freedom is an evergreen subject for Mitchell, but ""Blonde in the Bleachers"" gets beyond the thrill in partaking of what-- or, rather, who-- is offered up, backstage. The quiet story here is the ebbing power of a woman once she's been conquered.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell was criticized for not making blatantly feminist or political (read: sloganeering) albums, her work was always tacitly so. Her songs spotlight the unspoken roles of women (""Barandgrill""), who they were <i>unrelated</i> to men; she gave them names and precise details. There is hardly a more feminist topic than striving for a freedom that life and love has never allowed you. On ""Woman of Heart and Mind"", it's hard to tell whether she is mocking herself or the man she is singing to (or both): ""Push your papers/ Win your medals/ Fuck your strangers/ Don't it leave you on the empty side /I'm looking for affection and respect."" On <i>Roses</i>, Mitchell sounds like a woman who's had enough of everyone else's shit, an attitude that certainly put her in line with the libbers.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Her 1974 commercial break-out, <b><i>Court and Spark</i></b>, found her backed by first-call jazz session cats L.A. Express. It was her official severance from folk music. <i>Court</i> is her most pop album and gave her three chart hits, going gold five weeks after its release. Mitchell's production features heavy and sudden multi-tracked swells of her voice that spike melodies like a choir of accusing angels and mimic strings and horns. Her arrangement on ""Down to You"" (aided by Express bandleader Tom Scott) is stunning in its complexity, yet it never shakes you; it is still utterly a pop song. </span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Now six albums deep on the topic of love and loss, <i>Court</i> has a marked cynicism. It's a grown up album about arriving at the intractable issues of adult love. ""Help Me"", which was Mitchell's only top 10 hit, is reluctant about romance; she's ""hoping for the future/ And worrying about the past."" The refrain is pocked by the dawnlight realizations of that post-free love era: ""We love our lovin'/ But not like we love our freedom."" For the largeness of her band (which included Joe Sample of the Crusaders, and Larry Carlton, soon to be of every memorable Steely Dan guitar solo) they are nimble throughout; their finesse suited her own. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">To explain how and what happened next in Mitchell's career-- how much her <i>The Hissing of Summer Lawns</i> was viewed as not a stylistic departure but a <i>betrayal</i>-- we must first look at the run up. While promoting <i>Court</i>, what could easily be defined as the commercial and artistic high-water mark of her career, Mitchell went to go see Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour and wound up joining. At the time, she was a peer of Dylan, commercially and as a songwriter, she was also tight with tour member Robbie Robertson of the Band. She had a song in the Billboard Top 10-- <i>and she was opening</i>. When Mitchell recounts this in later interviews, she talks about how being on the tour was a matter of constantly having to subvert her ego to the men around her. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">At this same time, many of her peers were headed further toward the mainstream, towards syncopation, towards rock, towards retro revivalism. Mitchell saw there was not much of a place for her amongst the new talents and the Peter Pan-ing crew she came up with, as a woman in her early 30s, and she saw jazz as a genre that would allow her to age gracefully and expand as an artist-- and so there she went. She was trying to find or develop a place to belong. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Through all of this she arrived at <i><b>Hissing of Summer Lawns</b>.</i></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The 1975 album marks Mitchell's official departure from the mainstream, her embarking upon her jazzbo journey. It's the album of an artist absolutely assured of herself, and it's addressed to anyone who might not consider her a <i>serious</i> musician, who believed all she could do was confess her heartache. Though it doesn't have the rhapsodic rep as <i>Blue</i>, it's unquestionably one of Mitchell's finest albums, and it is certainly her most timeless. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">It opens easy enough with ""In France They Kiss on Main Street""-- a soft, linear move from <i>Court</i>. What follows is jarring if you were expecting more of the same: ""The Jungle Line"" runs over a distorting sample of the Royal Drummers of Burundi tribal pounding and chanting. Mitchell going from husky to her enunciation so precise about ""the mathematic circuits of the modern nights,"" the long, low whirring of a Moog running the melody line under Mitchell's acoustic strumming. The rest of the record is dark, tense, and lilts unapologetically toward something softer and more ornate than jazz fusion (no more than the later Steely Dan records it predated) with Mitchell singing observationally, about the place of women in the world, about the trade-offs they make for power and freedom. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell and women of her generation had been brought up with the idea that marriage to a man who took care of them would fulfill them entirely and that ambitions beyond that were frivolous. The album is a reckoning reflective of culture at the time; <i>Hissing </i>is an album of women trying to find their real selves in a world that had groomed them for quiet obeisance to men. On ""Harry's House"" Mitchell sings of a curdling domestic scene, of wives who ""paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid."" The song dovetails into the standard ""Centerpiece"", which she sings in a voice not her own, playacting with this ultra-feminine throwback voice, creating a critical distance when she sings the lines: ""I'm building all my dreams around you/ Our happiness will never cease/ 'Cause nothing's any good without you/ Baby you're my centerpiece.""<i> </i>And on the subtlety devastating ""Sweet Bird"", she sings of women wielding power through beauty and youth, and what is lost and gained in that bargaining: ""Power ideals and beauty/ Fading in everyone's hand"" and ""Calendars of our lives/ Circled with compromise.""</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell had never made a record that wasn't bigger than the one before and was shocked that her fans and many critics saw her new sound as an abandonment and misguided move, respectively. Reviewers chastised her for her ego. While the album went gold and brought her a Grammy nod, as her 1974 live album <i>Miles of Aisles</i> attests (a wonky fiasco, skip it) there were still plenty of people shouting for ""Big Yellow Taxi"". But that Joni didn't live here anymore. <i>Hissing</i> was proof. The era of Mitchell doing no wrong was over and if her audience couldn't hang, she wasn't about to do anything to reel them back in.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The two albums that followed are where Mitchell went off the grid. <i><b>Hejira</b>,</i> from 1976, was written while driving alone from Maine to L.A. and is a meditation on the value and melancholy of being alone, her guitar imitating the rhythms and expanse of the road. In spots it's as emotionally bare as <i>Blue</i>. It's a real <i>grown woman</i> album and may not make tremendous sense to anyone under 30. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Musically, Mitchell says she was trying to see how far she could get from traditional rhythm; the songs are long and lovely, burbling and unspooling. Whether or not you feel this era of Mitchell is unfairly maligned depends on how you feel about Jaco Pastorious and his fretless bass and its many, many notes fardling way up high in the mix. His playing lends a darkly cinematic feeling to the album, but in the decades since his trademark sound and style have been taken to such unpleasant extremes by jam and light jazz bands, it's understandable to experience a visceral revulsion.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Inspired by the rhythms of Brazilian music, Mitchell issued the experimental double-album <b><i>Don Juan's Reckless Daughter</i></b> in '77. Her experiments went further than just musical; she appears in brownface and an afro wig as a man on the cover. Less commented on is her in ""injun"" costume on the back, palm raised, a bubble above her head reads ""How!"" (Her cringe-inducing arguments about it later on included statements about how she has a ""black man's soul""). The album is <i>solidly</i> jazz-fusion, indulgent in length with still plenty of Jaco-dominance. But! there is reward in the album's centerpiece, if you can make it that far: The 16-minute ""Paprika Plains"" is a freakout of a song suite, inspired in part by a conversation with prickly ol' Bob Dylan. Even if you cannot abide by the album, we must be grateful for it, as it is Bjork's #1 favorite album and source of inspiration. The last piece in the box, <b><i>Mingus</i></b>, her 1979 collaboration with Charles Mingus before his death makes her seem like the jazz dilettante that people accused her of being. The ultimate result doesn't serve either of their legacies particularly well.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell's weird escapade through pop doesn't end where the box set does, she never recaptured the thread of popular imagination. Her 80s albums, like many of her hippie-era peers', were overbearing and scolding and featured awkward embraces of technology. She retired for long stretches to focus on her painting. Her last good record was 2000's <i>Both Sides Now</i>, where, her range ravaged by decades of smoking, she sings the definitive version of the titular song that launched her career and finally sounds like she's seen enough to know. </span></p></div>"|17269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17269-the-studio-albums-1968-1979/|10.0|Jessica Hopper

As America's finest living Canadian songwriter (tied with Neil Young), few musicians have understood its nature so well. In the 1960s and 70s, Mitchell was Mary Magdalene to Dylan's folk-rock messiah, making music that was bittersweet and relatable, carrying what Dylan begat even further. Her work helped birth a new idiom that was personal and poetic, creating a new space for songs that made artistic statements, unbound by cliché and tradition. Such was the strength of her music that Mitchell's lyrics didn't have to make sense. But they did, particularly to women.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell's first 10 studio albums, cut during an 11-year span, have been gathered in this import box set. During this run, Mitchell charted one of the most solid career arcs in contemporary music that then detoured into one of the strangest, following her muse into places that very nearly cost her career and exhausted her fanbase's patience. Throughout, she was confident and unrepentant in her vision, in an era where that kind of ego was unbefitting a woman, even if she did have the gold albums and Grammys™ to back it up. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is a basic set-- no frills, just all the albums' original layouts reproduced in envelope sleeves, the fonts so tiny only mice could read them. There are no extras, outtakes or re-anythinged. But taking these 10 records in a row, chronologically, it is a striking reminder no single artist has had a run like Joni (even her acolyte Prince only got to seven albums before he started to fall off). Mitchell was pop's first female auteur, an innovator of singular talent, whose influence was vast, immediate (see: Led Zeppelin's ""Going to California"") and long lasting (Joanna Newsom, St. Vincent, Taylor Swift's kiss'n'tell cottage industry).</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell was ""discovered"" c. 1968 when ex-Byrd David Crosby pulled up in a sailboat outside the Florida club she was playing and took her to L.A. At the time, folk was out of fashion yet Mitchell managed to pull down an unprecedented major label deal for a girl and her guitar: total and complete artistic freedom, with the caveat that Crosby would produce her first album. It was rare for a woman to be writing and recording her own material at the time, let alone to be an unaccompanied solo act. Though Mitchell's debut, <b><i>Song to a Seagull</i></b>, was a heavy precedent for the era it's a harder listen now, the fin de siècle earth-mama lyrics playing strange against the stilted, formal musical settings. The delicate album suffers under Crosby's intrusive production; Mitchell would self-produce from then on. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Clouds</i></b> (1969) is the introduction to Mitchell's real deal, shaking folk tradition and giving off a little humor and spirit. The album sounds <i>casual</i>. Lyrically, she was transitioning from the era's de facto hippie sensualism (colors! the weather! vibes!) to the classically prosodic style (Keats! Cohen!) she'd become known for. The album's biggest signs of life are two of her most famous songs-- the kicky ""Chelsea Morning"", which is about as straightforward as Mitchell ever got, and ""Both Sides Now"". Though she'd known burden and heartache plenty by her still-tender age (she'd borne a child alone and in secret after dropping out of art school and married singer Chuck Mitchell in order to make a family; he changed his mind a month later and she put the baby up for adoption) she sounds a bit too young and chipper to be singing about disillusionment. Still, <i>Clouds</i> was a landmark, and she landed a Grammy for Best Folk Performance.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Ladies of the Canyon</i></b> from 1970 is Mitchell's most accessible album and it introduces her earnest folk-pop style. Her voice is newly elastic and expressive, and it's the first record where she sounds like she might actually be fun to hang out with. <i>Ladies </i>also features her generation-defining ""Woodstock"", ""The Circle Game"" (Mitchell's answer back to Neil Young's nostalgic ""Sugar Mountain""), and her blustery gentrification sing-along, ""Big Yellow Taxi"". All were hippie-era sing-along staples; it hardly bears remarking that these songs are some of Mitchell's corniest. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The genius of <i>Ladies </i>is often circumscribed by Mitchell's proximity to CSNY; the vocal arrangement and production invariably propped to Crosby's influence, ""Woodstock"" supposedly inspired by Nash's recounting of the event (she wrote it before he'd even returned from the festival). If <i>Ladies</i> does bear the mark of CSNY, it's to the album's detriment. The fruits of the Nash/Mitchell romance-- his gee-whiz domestic ode, ""Our House"" and <i>Ladies</i>' ""Willy""-- are saccharine at best. Their subsequent break up would inspire much more potent work-- Neil Young's ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and Mitchell's follow-up. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">About that follow-up: 1971's <b><i>Blue</i></b> is possibly the most gutting break-up album ever made. After Mitchell's relationship with Nash dissolved, she headed to Europe to lose the tether of her fame, eventually taking exile in a cave on the Greek island Crete. The trip would inspire the how-Joni-got-her-groove-back ditties ""Carey"" and ""California"". The album is suffused with melancholy for all that is missing: her daughter (""Little Green""), innocence (""The Last Time I Saw Richard""), and connection (""All I Want""). Mitchell bleeds diffidence and highlights it with spare notes plucked out on her Appalachian dulcimer. While her pals Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and Laura Nyro were also pushing the singer-songwriter genre forward, none of them managed to stride the distance that Mitchell did here in a single album.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">""Will you take me as I am/ Strung out on another man?"" Mitchell pleads on ""California"".

As America's finest living Canadian songwriter (tied with Neil Young), few musicians have understood its nature so well. In the 1960s and 70s, Mitchell was Mary Magdalene to Dylan's folk-rock messiah, making music that was bittersweet and relatable, carrying what Dylan begat even further. Her work helped birth a new idiom that was personal and poetic, creating a new space for songs that made artistic statements, unbound by cliché and tradition. Such was the strength of her music that Mitchell's lyrics didn't have to make sense. But they did, particularly to women.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell's first 10 studio albums, cut during an 11-year span, have been gathered in this import box set. During this run, Mitchell charted one of the most solid career arcs in contemporary music that then detoured into one of the strangest, following her muse into places that very nearly cost her career and exhausted her fanbase's patience. Throughout, she was confident and unrepentant in her vision, in an era where that kind of ego was unbefitting a woman, even if she did have the gold albums and Grammys™ to back it up. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is a basic set-- no frills, just all the albums' original layouts reproduced in envelope sleeves, the fonts so tiny only mice could read them. There are no extras, outtakes or re-anythinged. But taking these 10 records in a row, chronologically, it is a striking reminder no single artist has had a run like Joni (even her acolyte Prince only got to seven albums before he started to fall off). Mitchell was pop's first female auteur, an innovator of singular talent, whose influence was vast, immediate (see: Led Zeppelin's ""Going to California"") and long lasting (Joanna Newsom, St. Vincent, Taylor Swift's kiss'n'tell cottage industry).</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell was ""discovered"" c. 1968 when ex-Byrd David Crosby pulled up in a sailboat outside the Florida club she was playing and took her to L.A. At the time, folk was out of fashion yet Mitchell managed to pull down an unprecedented major label deal for a girl and her guitar: total and complete artistic freedom, with the caveat that Crosby would produce her first album. It was rare for a woman to be writing and recording her own material at the time, let alone to be an unaccompanied solo act. Though Mitchell's debut, <b><i>Song to a Seagull</i></b>, was a heavy precedent for the era it's a harder listen now, the fin de siècle earth-mama lyrics playing strange against the stilted, formal musical settings. The delicate album suffers under Crosby's intrusive production; Mitchell would self-produce from then on. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Clouds</i></b> (1969) is the introduction to Mitchell's real deal, shaking folk tradition and giving off a little humor and spirit. The album sounds <i>casual</i>. Lyrically, she was transitioning from the era's de facto hippie sensualism (colors! the weather! vibes!) to the classically prosodic style (Keats! Cohen!) she'd become known for. The album's biggest signs of life are two of her most famous songs-- the kicky ""Chelsea Morning"", which is about as straightforward as Mitchell ever got, and ""Both Sides Now"". Though she'd known burden and heartache plenty by her still-tender age (she'd borne a child alone and in secret after dropping out of art school and married singer Chuck Mitchell in order to make a family; he changed his mind a month later and she put the baby up for adoption) she sounds a bit too young and chipper to be singing about disillusionment. Still, <i>Clouds</i> was a landmark, and she landed a Grammy for Best Folk Performance.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><b><i>Ladies of the Canyon</i></b> from 1970 is Mitchell's most accessible album and it introduces her earnest folk-pop style. Her voice is newly elastic and expressive, and it's the first record where she sounds like she might actually be fun to hang out with. <i>Ladies </i>also features her generation-defining ""Woodstock"", ""The Circle Game"" (Mitchell's answer back to Neil Young's nostalgic ""Sugar Mountain""), and her blustery gentrification sing-along, ""Big Yellow Taxi"". All were hippie-era sing-along staples; it hardly bears remarking that these songs are some of Mitchell's corniest. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The genius of <i>Ladies </i>is often circumscribed by Mitchell's proximity to CSNY; the vocal arrangement and production invariably propped to Crosby's influence, ""Woodstock"" supposedly inspired by Nash's recounting of the event (she wrote it before he'd even returned from the festival). If <i>Ladies</i> does bear the mark of CSNY, it's to the album's detriment. The fruits of the Nash/Mitchell romance-- his gee-whiz domestic ode, ""Our House"" and <i>Ladies</i>' ""Willy""-- are saccharine at best. Their subsequent break up would inspire much more potent work-- Neil Young's ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and Mitchell's follow-up. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">About that follow-up: 1971's <b><i>Blue</i></b> is possibly the most gutting break-up album ever made. After Mitchell's relationship with Nash dissolved, she headed to Europe to lose the tether of her fame, eventually taking exile in a cave on the Greek island Crete. The trip would inspire the how-Joni-got-her-groove-back ditties ""Carey"" and ""California"". The album is suffused with melancholy for all that is missing: her daughter (""Little Green""), innocence (""The Last Time I Saw Richard""), and connection (""All I Want""). Mitchell bleeds diffidence and highlights it with spare notes plucked out on her Appalachian dulcimer. While her pals Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and Laura Nyro were also pushing the singer-songwriter genre forward, none of them managed to stride the distance that Mitchell did here in a single album.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">""Will you take me as I am/ Strung out on another man?"" Mitchell pleads on ""California"". She was (in)famously strung out on other talents that were as mercurial as hers, fueling constant speculation as to whether this song was about Leonard Cohen, or that one about James Taylor or Nash or that puerile heartbreaker Jackson Browne. The year Mitchell issued <i>Blue</i>, an album that would be a landmark in any artist's career, Rolling Stone named her ""Old Lady of the Year,"" a dismissal effectively saying her import was as a girlfriend or muse to the men around her more than as an artist in her own right. Worse still, they called her ""Queen of El Lay,"" and offered a diagram of her supposed affairs and conquests. She'd made the best album of her career and in exchange she got slut-shamed in the biggest music magazine in America. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell retired to her homestead in Canada and returned sounding confident for 1972's <b><i>For the Roses</i></b>. Up until <i>Roses </i>she'd kept things minimal, here she stacked multi-tracks of impossible vocals harmonies, mimicking a horn section (""Let the Wind Carry Me"") or interpolating and dueling with jazzer sideman Tom Scott's riffing woodwinds. Mitchell's vocals, fluttering unpredictably and with stunning control between the bottom of her range and the top of her crystalline contralto, were given a new stop; her heavy smoking had given her a heretofore non-existent midrange. There's really no singing along with <i>Roses</i>--  which is a fabulous fuck-you for a pop artist.</span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though part of the reason that she'd retired from performing in 1969 was to avoid the default of writing about the myopic rock'n'roll life, <i>Roses</i>' standout track, ""Blonde in the Bleachers"", shows that she may have understood it better than any of the boys; it is one of the best songs ever written about the rules and (gender) roles of the road. ""It seems like you've got to give up/ Such a piece of your soul /When you give up the chase,"" she sings, about finding identity and meaning in who you fuck. Freedom is an evergreen subject for Mitchell, but ""Blonde in the Bleachers"" gets beyond the thrill in partaking of what-- or, rather, who-- is offered up, backstage. The quiet story here is the ebbing power of a woman once she's been conquered.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell was criticized for not making blatantly feminist or political (read: sloganeering) albums, her work was always tacitly so. Her songs spotlight the unspoken roles of women (""Barandgrill""), who they were <i>unrelated</i> to men; she gave them names and precise details. There is hardly a more feminist topic than striving for a freedom that life and love has never allowed you. On ""Woman of Heart and Mind"", it's hard to tell whether she is mocking herself or the man she is singing to (or both): ""Push your papers/ Win your medals/ Fuck your strangers/ Don't it leave you on the empty side /I'm looking for affection and respect."" On <i>Roses</i>, Mitchell sounds like a woman who's had enough of everyone else's shit, an attitude that certainly put her in line with the libbers.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Her 1974 commercial break-out, <b><i>Court and Spark</i></b>, found her backed by first-call jazz session cats L.A. Express. It was her official severance from folk music. <i>Court</i> is her most pop album and gave her three chart hits, going gold five weeks after its release. Mitchell's production features heavy and sudden multi-tracked swells of her voice that spike melodies like a choir of accusing angels and mimic strings and horns. Her arrangement on ""Down to You"" (aided by Express bandleader Tom Scott) is stunning in its complexity, yet it never shakes you; it is still utterly a pop song. </span> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Now six albums deep on the topic of love and loss, <i>Court</i> has a marked cynicism. It's a grown up album about arriving at the intractable issues of adult love. ""Help Me"", which was Mitchell's only top 10 hit, is reluctant about romance; she's ""hoping for the future/ And worrying about the past."" The refrain is pocked by the dawnlight realizations of that post-free love era: ""We love our lovin'/ But not like we love our freedom."" For the largeness of her band (which included Joe Sample of the Crusaders, and Larry Carlton, soon to be of every memorable Steely Dan guitar solo) they are nimble throughout; their finesse suited her own. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">To explain how and what happened next in Mitchell's career-- how much her <i>The Hissing of Summer Lawns</i> was viewed as not a stylistic departure but a <i>betrayal</i>-- we must first look at the run up. While promoting <i>Court</i>, what could easily be defined as the commercial and artistic high-water mark of her career, Mitchell went to go see Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour and wound up joining. At the time, she was a peer of Dylan, commercially and as a songwriter, she was also tight with tour member Robbie Robertson of the Band. She had a song in the Billboard Top 10-- <i>and she was opening</i>. When Mitchell recounts this in later interviews, she talks about how being on the tour was a matter of constantly having to subvert her ego to the men around her. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">At this same time, many of her peers were headed further toward the mainstream, towards syncopation, towards rock, towards retro revivalism. Mitchell saw there was not much of a place for her amongst the new talents and the Peter Pan-ing crew she came up with, as a woman in her early 30s, and she saw jazz as a genre that would allow her to age gracefully and expand as an artist-- and so there she went. She was trying to find or develop a place to belong. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Through all of this she arrived at <i><b>Hissing of Summer Lawns</b>.</i></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The 1975 album marks Mitchell's official departure from the mainstream, her embarking upon her jazzbo journey. It's the album of an artist absolutely assured of herself, and it's addressed to anyone who might not consider her a <i>serious</i> musician, who believed all she could do was confess her heartache. Though it doesn't have the rhapsodic rep as <i>Blue</i>, it's unquestionably one of Mitchell's finest albums, and it is certainly her most timeless. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">It opens easy enough with ""In France They Kiss on Main Street""-- a soft, linear move from <i>Court</i>. What follows is jarring if you were expecting more of the same: ""The Jungle Line"" runs over a distorting sample of the Royal Drummers of Burundi tribal pounding and chanting. Mitchell going from husky to her enunciation so precise about ""the mathematic circuits of the modern nights,"" the long, low whirring of a Moog running the melody line under Mitchell's acoustic strumming. The rest of the record is dark, tense, and lilts unapologetically toward something softer and more ornate than jazz fusion (no more than the later Steely Dan records it predated) with Mitchell singing observationally, about the place of women in the world, about the trade-offs they make for power and freedom. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell and women of her generation had been brought up with the idea that marriage to a man who took care of them would fulfill them entirely and that ambitions beyond that were frivolous. The album is a reckoning reflective of culture at the time; <i>Hissing </i>is an album of women trying to find their real selves in a world that had groomed them for quiet obeisance to men. On ""Harry's House"" Mitchell sings of a curdling domestic scene, of wives who ""paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid."" The song dovetails into the standard ""Centerpiece"", which she sings in a voice not her own, playacting with this ultra-feminine throwback voice, creating a critical distance when she sings the lines: ""I'm building all my dreams around you/ Our happiness will never cease/ 'Cause nothing's any good without you/ Baby you're my centerpiece.""<i> </i>And on the subtlety devastating ""Sweet Bird"", she sings of women wielding power through beauty and youth, and what is lost and gained in that bargaining: ""Power ideals and beauty/ Fading in everyone's hand"" and ""Calendars of our lives/ Circled with compromise.""</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell had never made a record that wasn't bigger than the one before and was shocked that her fans and many critics saw her new sound as an abandonment and misguided move, respectively. Reviewers chastised her for her ego. While the album went gold and brought her a Grammy nod, as her 1974 live album <i>Miles of Aisles</i> attests (a wonky fiasco, skip it) there were still plenty of people shouting for ""Big Yellow Taxi"". But that Joni didn't live here anymore. <i>Hissing</i> was proof. The era of Mitchell doing no wrong was over and if her audience couldn't hang, she wasn't about to do anything to reel them back in.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The two albums that followed are where Mitchell went off the grid. <i><b>Hejira</b>,</i> from 1976, was written while driving alone from Maine to L.A. and is a meditation on the value and melancholy of being alone, her guitar imitating the rhythms and expanse of the road. In spots it's as emotionally bare as <i>Blue</i>. It's a real <i>grown woman</i> album and may not make tremendous sense to anyone under 30. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Musically, Mitchell says she was trying to see how far she could get from traditional rhythm; the songs are long and lovely, burbling and unspooling. Whether or not you feel this era of Mitchell is unfairly maligned depends on how you feel about Jaco Pastorious and his fretless bass and its many, many notes fardling way up high in the mix. His playing lends a darkly cinematic feeling to the album, but in the decades since his trademark sound and style have been taken to such unpleasant extremes by jam and light jazz bands, it's understandable to experience a visceral revulsion.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Inspired by the rhythms of Brazilian music, Mitchell issued the experimental double-album <b><i>Don Juan's Reckless Daughter</i></b> in '77. Her experiments went further than just musical; she appears in brownface and an afro wig as a man on the cover. Less commented on is her in ""injun"" costume on the back, palm raised, a bubble above her head reads ""How!"" (Her cringe-inducing arguments about it later on included statements about how she has a ""black man's soul""). The album is <i>solidly</i> jazz-fusion, indulgent in length with still plenty of Jaco-dominance. But! there is reward in the album's centerpiece, if you can make it that far: The 16-minute ""Paprika Plains"" is a freakout of a song suite, inspired in part by a conversation with prickly ol' Bob Dylan. Even if you cannot abide by the album, we must be grateful for it, as it is Bjork's #1 favorite album and source of inspiration. The last piece in the box, <b><i>Mingus</i></b>, her 1979 collaboration with Charles Mingus before his death makes her seem like the jazz dilettante that people accused her of being. The ultimate result doesn't serve either of their legacies particularly well.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell's weird escapade through pop doesn't end where the box set does, she never recaptured the thread of popular imagination. Her 80s albums, like many of her hippie-era peers', were overbearing and scolding and featured awkward embraces of technology. She retired for long stretches to focus on her painting. Her last good record was 2000's <i>Both Sides Now</i>, where, her range ravaged by decades of smoking, she sings the definitive version of the titular song that launched her career and finally sounds like she's seen enough to know. </span></p></div>"|17269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17269-the-studio-albums-1968-1979/|6.1|Jessica Hopper

<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Through all of this she arrived at <i><b>Hissing of Summer Lawns</b>.</i></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The 1975 album marks Mitchell's official departure from the mainstream, her embarking upon her jazzbo journey. It's the album of an artist absolutely assured of herself, and it's addressed to anyone who might not consider her a <i>serious</i> musician, who believed all she could do was confess her heartache. Though it doesn't have the rhapsodic rep as <i>Blue</i>, it's unquestionably one of Mitchell's finest albums, and it is certainly her most timeless. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">It opens easy enough with ""In France They Kiss on Main Street""-- a soft, linear move from <i>Court</i>. What follows is jarring if you were expecting more of the same: ""The Jungle Line"" runs over a distorting sample of the Royal Drummers of Burundi tribal pounding and chanting. Mitchell going from husky to her enunciation so precise about ""the mathematic circuits of the modern nights,"" the long, low whirring of a Moog running the melody line under Mitchell's acoustic strumming. The rest of the record is dark, tense, and lilts unapologetically toward something softer and more ornate than jazz fusion (no more than the later Steely Dan records it predated) with Mitchell singing observationally, about the place of women in the world, about the trade-offs they make for power and freedom. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell and women of her generation had been brought up with the idea that marriage to a man who took care of them would fulfill them entirely and that ambitions beyond that were frivolous. The album is a reckoning reflective of culture at the time; <i>Hissing </i>is an album of women trying to find their real selves in a world that had groomed them for quiet obeisance to men. On ""Harry's House"" Mitchell sings of a curdling domestic scene, of wives who ""paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid."" The song dovetails into the standard ""Centerpiece"", which she sings in a voice not her own, playacting with this ultra-feminine throwback voice, creating a critical distance when she sings the lines: ""I'm building all my dreams around you/ Our happiness will never cease/ 'Cause nothing's any good without you/ Baby you're my centerpiece.""<i> </i>And on the subtlety devastating ""Sweet Bird"", she sings of women wielding power through beauty and youth, and what is lost and gained in that bargaining: ""Power ideals and beauty/ Fading in everyone's hand"" and ""Calendars of our lives/ Circled with compromise.""</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Mitchell had never made a record that wasn't bigger than the one before and was shocked that her fans and many critics saw her new sound as an abandonment and misguided move, respectively. Reviewers chastised her for her ego. While the album went gold and brought her a Grammy nod, as her 1974 live album <i>Miles of Aisles</i> attests (a wonky fiasco, skip it) there were still plenty of people shouting for ""Big Yellow Taxi"". But that Joni didn't live here anymore. <i>Hissing</i> was proof. The era of Mitchell doing no wrong was over and if her audience couldn't hang, she wasn't about to do anything to reel them back in.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The two albums that followed are where Mitchell went off the grid. <i><b>Hejira</b>,</i> from 1976, was written while driving alone from Maine to L.A. and is a meditation on the value and melancholy of being alone, her guitar imitating the rhythms and expanse of the road. In spots it's as emotionally bare as <i>Blue</i>. It's a real <i>grown woman</i> album and may not make tremendous sense to anyone under 30. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Musically, Mitchell says she was trying to see how far she could get from traditional rhythm; the songs are long and lovely, burbling and unspooling. Whether or not you feel this era of Mitchell is unfairly maligned depends on how you feel about Jaco Pastorious and his fretless bass and its many, many notes fardling way up high in the mix. His playing lends a darkly cinematic feeling to the album, but in the decades since his trademark sound and style have been taken to such unpleasant extremes by jam and light jazz bands, it's understandable to experience a visceral revulsion.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Inspired by the rhythms of Brazilian music, Mitchell issued the experimental double-album <b><i>Don Juan's Reckless Daughter</i></b> in '77. Her experiments went further than just musical; she appears in brownface and an afro wig as a man on the cover. Less commented on is her in ""injun"" costume on the back, palm raised, a bubble above her head reads ""How!"" (Her cringe-inducing arguments about it later on included statements about how she has a ""black man's soul""). The album is <i>solidly</i> jazz-fusion, indulgent in length with still plenty of Jaco-dominance. But! there is reward in the album's centerpiece, if you can make it that far: The 16-minute ""Paprika Plains"" is a freakout of a song suite, inspired in part by a conversation with prickly ol' Bob Dylan. Even if you cannot abide by the album, we must be grateful for it, as it is Bjork's #1 favorite album and source of inspiration. The last piece in the box, <b><i>Mingus</i></b>, her 1979 collaboration with Charles Mingus before his death makes her seem like the jazz dilettante that people accused her of being. The ultimate result doesn't serve either of their legacies particularly well.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Though Mitchell's weird escapade through pop doesn't end where the box set does, she never recaptured the thread of popular imagination. Her 80s albums, like many of her hippie-era peers', were overbearing and scolding and featured awkward embraces of technology. She retired for long stretches to focus on her painting. Her last good record was 2000's <i>Both Sides Now</i>, where, her range ravaged by decades of smoking, she sings the definitive version of the titular song that launched her career and finally sounds like she's seen enough to know. </span></p></div>"|17269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17269-the-studio-albums-1968-1979/|5.5|Jessica Hopper

If you've ever fantasized about starting your own, you probably spent some time dreaming up genre concepts and brainstorming cool names. A new wave band, a Hindi-pop act, a desert psych group, complete with own logos, all crudely scrawled across your high school assignment book. Sisters Taraka and Nimai Larson-- anchors of the new-age revival project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28935-prince-rama/"" target=""_blank"">Prince Rama</a>-- are no strangers to mixing make believe and music. From their background as Hare Krishnas to far-out live shows that often verge on performance art to conducting ""group exorcisms disguised as VHS workouts,"" the spectacle is just as important as what makes it onto Prince Rama's records. Their latest, <i>Top 10 Hits of the End of the World</i>, takes that principle to a new extreme: It's a concept album in which the Brooklyn group ""invented 10 different pop bands that died during the apocalypse, channeling the ghosts of each one to perform the various songs."" This premise includes a new wave band, a Hindi-pop act, and a desert psych group, all complete with  fictional bios and names like the Metaphysixxx, Nu Fighters, and I.M.M.O.R.T.A.L.I.F.E.</p>
<p>Now, making this kind of concept work would be difficult for even the most capable artists, let alone Prince Rama, whose previous two albums on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>'s label <a href=""http://www.paw-tracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paw Tracks</a> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14710-shadow-temple/"" target=""_blank""><i>Shadow Temple</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15933-trust-now/"" target=""_blank""><i>Trust Now</i></a>) were spotty at best. But miraculously, Prince Rama have curated an enjoyable pop experience that both works independently of its concept and pays greater dividends the more you play along. Still reluctant to completely disavow their roots-- layers of summersaulting drums, new-age synths, and melodies steeped in Eastern musics all remain-- Prince Rama have placed the importance of movement, hooks, and accessibility above all else. Take the excellent ""No Way Back"" (an interpretation of the single by the imaginary motorcycle band/ murderous graverobbers Nu Fighters), which takes the pair's mythic, seance-y vibes and refracts them through the mirroball, complete with acid-washed guitar squeals and a strangely sinister, wind-in-your-face feeling of freedom. Whether it's the ABBA worship of ""We Will Fallin Love Again"" or the wink to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a> on the clubby, pulsating <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14340-those-who-live-for-love-will-live-forever/"" target=""_blank"">""Those Who Live For Love Will Live Forever"",</a> the nods are often subtle, but still clever enough to make you reconsider Prince Rama's potential altogether.</p>
<p>The lack of humor and self-awareness in Prince Rama's music has always been a stumbling block, and part of what sets <i>End of the World</i> apart is how quickly it offers itself to parody while mostly avoiding complete self-sabotage. From the absurd, phony band press shots to the those backstories (the blurbs regarding the Metaphysixxx and I.M.M.O.R.T.A.L.I.F.E. are wonderfully stupid), the Larsons seem in on a joke that was frequently pointed only at them, and the reversal is endearing. The newfound carefree attitude suits nicely: While the oddly <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFkzRNyygfk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Creep""</a>-ish, frat boy dub of ""Welcome to the Now Age"" or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a> Goes Bollywood feel of ""Radhamadhava"" might not make for a great songs, they don't make for boring ones, either.</p>
<p><i>End of the World</i> still isn't quite as fun as it could be, as the Larson sisters slip back into old habits on a string of tracks that are too reminiscent of last year's<i> Trust Now</i>. They're not totally disposable and actually make for above-average Prince Rama songs, but often don't embrace the potential of the genre-bending fun that's in front of them. Not to mention that pretty much every track on the record could've greatly benefitted from a high-definition mix instead of the slightly muffled one they've ended up going with here. Still, you have to hand it to Prince Rama, who've taken a potentially disastrous conceit and made it work within the context of their music an their personality. It's a testament to the fact that sometimes <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk9aThIovMA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fictional</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cEdqWZi13I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bands</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrhJT98IoaQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">are</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaWb4ElB_Ko&amp;feature=player_embedded"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e9HZyJ759I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lot</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk2-01qE_18"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">better</a> than some of the real ones we have, and for an act like Prince Rama-- whose own skewed sense of reality was once a deterrent-- it's an idea that's realized on <i>End of the World</i> in the form of a compliment.</p></div>"|17278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17278-top-10-hits-of-the-end-of-the-world/|6.8|Zach Kelly

Metal's original trinity-- Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple-- all started in Britain's blues scene, and those roots are still discernible on their early records. Even into the 1980s, there were traces of the good-time boogie music of Jimmy Reed and Slim Harpo in hair metal, while darker strains of Howlin' Wolf and John Lee Hooker lurked inside Glenn Danzig's outsized persona. It wasn't until the last 20 years, when thrash and black metal became the predominant influences on emerging bands, that bluesy metal took a turn toward the passé. Except in Sweden, that is, where long-haired and leather-lunged 70s rock fetishists like <a href=""http://graveyardmusic.com/s/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Graveyard</a> are as plentiful as cheap, fashionable furniture.</p>
<p>Pitched as the midpoint between Sabbath-obsessed sludge merchants like Witchcraft and funkier, Free/Thin Lizzy-inspired outfits like Horisont, Graveyard don't stick to strict 12-bar formulas or indulge in the usual ""I can't quit you baby"" blues lyrical clichés. But the hellacious, Bon Scott-like screeching of Joakim Nilsson and the darkly danceable groove that unmistakably slithers through the band's third record, <i>Lights Out</i>, point to a tradition of American blues and European blues rock that's always been part of metal's family tree, no matter the latest fashion.</p>
<p>For contemporary metal fans, <i>Lights Out </i>might sound more like Wolfmother-- or a supercharged version of the Black Crowes-- than an actual metal record. It's true that Graveyard disregard nearly 40 years of the genre's history; <i>Lights Out </i>essentially picks up where <i>Paranoid </i>and <i>Machine Head </i>left off, and re-imagines a different path for metal that amps the intensity of the originators but keeps the Mississippi Delta-via-Birmingham vibe intact. <i>Lights Out </i>also shares the subtle political undercurrent of many of those early metal records, though the targets are vague enough to be as applicable to 2012 as to 1972. The furious ""Goliath"" includes references to ""consumer wars"" and ""wolves at the door"" over pile-driving drums and the dueling, endlessly soloing guitars of Nilsson and Jonathan Ramm. The anger is even more palpable on ""An Industry of Murder"", a death march that sounds like ""Black Sabbath"" played in double-time, where Nilsson finds common ground between 60s hippie-speak and OWS sloganeering, howling, ""The unholy alliance, god and money seals the pact/ Old friends turn into enemies, when greed has set your path.""</p>
<p>Graveyard already proved they could turn out catchy, scream-y blues-rock songs like <i>Lights Out </i>highlights ""The Suits, the Law &amp; the Uniforms"" and the hyperkinetic ""Seven Seven"" on 2011's <i>Hisingen Blues. </i>Where <i>Lights Out </i>diverges is on the ballads. On these, Graveyard sound like a completely different band, particularly Nilsson, who softens his voice to a gentle coo on the slowly swelling, strings-heavy epic ""Slow Motion Countdown"". Only on ""Hard Time Lovin'"" does Graveyard slip into retro-rock shtick, with Nilsson singing frankly ridiculous lyrics about a hard-touring rock dude and his lady-- ""And sure I've tasted fruit of many kind/ Once I got a piece of you there was no need for nothing else""-- over a foreboding, fuck-me lurch. Better is ""Fool in the End"", a moody exercise in sullen self-pity with a great stuttering riff that ends with a potent explosion of over-amped hostility.</p>
<p>Bands like Graveyard will always be susceptible to accusations of nostalgia, but <i>Lights Out </i>works because it feels like a genuine continuation of its source material, rather than some kind of corny, ersatz tribute. Traditions in metal, as in blues, act as signposts that must be respected, even when they're diverged from. No matter where you go, at some point you're obliged to eventually bring it all back home.</p></div>"|17380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17380-lights-out/|7.0|Steven Hyden

Yours is not Dead Prez's ""It's Bigger Than Hip Hop"", which was set to production big-budget-sounding enough that actual Complacent Big-Budget Rapper 50 Cent hijacked it to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYUo9fFPEik"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">idly jab at Diddy</a>. Do you have a song cataloging the evils of capitalism? Yours does not go so far as to include the rallying cry, ""Organize the wealth into a Socialist economy,"" like ""Police State"". In a field full of mealy-mouthed sloganeering and smug self-satisfaction, Stic.man and M1 have the courage of their convictions, and they have remained radical and unpredictable for over a decade-- no mean feat.</p>
<p>All the courage in the world, however, could not salvage <i>Information Age</i>, in which the duo scraps every compelling element of its music and go full Enya. Give them credit: this, too, was anything but predictable. (Or perhaps the herbal tea, incense, and croutons of ""Mind Sex"" telegraphed all this to the observant years ago.) In interviews about the album, they've namechecked Afrika Bambaataa, dubbing the sound they've settled on here as <a href=""http://stupiddope.com/2012/10/26/interview-w-dead-prez/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""soul sonic,""</a> but the album feels like a Relaxation Spa compilation breathing softly on your neck hairs. It's a disheartening take on an old story, the one where well-established, respected artists tack bravely out into ""new territory"" and, well, just completely lose everyone.</p>
<p>M1 and Stic.man shouldn't be expected to keep the same revolutionaries' glower on their faces forever; everyone deserves room to evolve. But the neutered new age crooning of the hook on ""A New Beginning"" isn't evolution, it's a slow-motion car wreck. The chimes and string washes of the following track ""Take Me to the Future""; the billowy, oscillating synths in ""Time Travel""; they are the precise sonic equivalent of the poorly photoshopped Buddha on the album's cover.</p>
<p>Lyrically, the record is even sadder: Hearing two former firebrands and genuinely dope rappers offering Joel Osteen seminar-speak like ""I want change I can live in, not just to believe in... I'mma start with the man in the mirror/ My vision getting clearer/ Feel like I'm at the dawn of a new era"" is unspeakably depressing. On ""A New Beginning"", their rhyme patterns and messages are so rudimentary that the song skews closer to a low-budget PSA featuring public figures ""rapping."" It's impossible to know what M1 and Stic.man thought they were achieving by simplifying their message to this excruciating level, but it's mind-bending to consider an indefensible string of lines like ""The more you know, the more you know you don't know/ And if you don't know there's more you can know, then you won't grow"" or ""Treat it like organic food, make it something you can chew"" (""Learning Growing Changing"") as the work of people who have had to dispel rumors of <a href=""about:blank"">ghostwriting for Nas</a>.</p>
<p>Then of course, there's ""Dirty White Girl"", which finds them calling white women ""the devil's daughter"" and features lines like ""Milk on your moustache/ Ugggh, what's that? I don't trust that, that's suspect."" No one should expect artists, not even explicitly political ones, to offer coherent social platforms, or consistent rhetoric; they just have to make good art. But <i>Information Age</i> doesn't work as enlightenment, as rap music, or as anything else, really. You can't bob your head to it; you can't learn anything from it. This is music that fails at everything it tries to do.</p></div>"|17290.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17290-information-age/|3.4|Jayson Greene

The Stones Throw drummer/producer has worked with everyone from Paul McCartney to Common and tours with Diana Krall, a fellow mentee of the late jazz bassist Ray Brown, who, in turn, played alongside Dizzy Gillespie and pianist Oscar Peterson. Though his new album <i>Alone Together </i>is his first solo offering, it sounds like the work of a vet and is a grand addition to the ever-expanding canon of instrumental beat tapes. Because the producer is such a talented chameleon-- evoking with the 34 tracks here a whole range of his fellows-- the album ends up functioning as a sort of survey course: every piece, based on its distinct construction and influences, will lead the curious listener down a rabbit hole of wonderful sounds.</p>
<p>As a hip-hop instrumentalist, Riggins hews most closely to the Dilla format, taking miniaturized loops and samples and scrambling them together to come up with the eminently digestible sketches now immortalized as ""donuts."" This approach frequently yields tracks that sound time-stamped by certain periods of Dilla's progression, as if Riggins reached into his fellow Detroit native's seemingly bottomless vault in order to gain inspiration for his own meanderings. ""Round the Outside"" could be a great, lost sketch from the <i>Ruff Draft </i>sessions and the 40 second dream ""Orbitz"" contains that encoded whispering that marked <i>Donuts</i> as a distinctly spiritual experience. ""Double Trouble"" evokes Dilla most strongly; its woodwind flourishes and tonal progressions may as well have been produced by Jay Dee's ghost.  </p>
<p>But Riggins is more than just a convincing Dilla clone. The producer's interest in exotic instrumentation also recalls some of Madlib's more far-flung forays. ""Moogy Foog It"" (think <i>Beat Konducta in India), </i>""Esperanza"" (which incorporates a trilling flute), ""Africa"", and ""Back in Brazil"" are spread throughout the album, and each time one pops up, it makes for a peregrine treat, providing an outré extension to some of the more familiar sounds.  </p>
<p>Though it works in many places, the scattering of sound-alikes is symptomatic of <i>Alone Together</i>'s principal downside. There appears to be little thought put into sequencing-- tracks are placed back to back with all the personal investment of the iPod's shuffle function. ""Stadium Rock"", though aptly titled with its gladiator ululation, is a little jarring, coming as it does after the melody of ""Oooooaaaaa"".  Meanwhile, the anxiety-inducing ""Because"", contains a jagged section of electric guitar which describes a tension that's altogether absent from the rest of the album.</p>
<p>For the most part, the analog warmth of live instrumentation is employed thoughtfully, reminiscent, in some places, of some of the best tracks on Oddisee's fantastic <i>Rock Creek Park.</i> The sketches come alive when they incorporate dulcet bell tones on ""Ding Dong Bells"", reedy harpsichord on ""Harpsichord Session"", and alto flute on ""Alto Flute"". (It's a minor complaint, but Riggins clearly needs a crash course in the art of naming things: There's a good chance his household pets are named Dog, Cat, and Bird.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Complementing the warmth of the instruments are the voices. Riggins particularly excels when he incorporates live vocals, as on ""Tom Toms"", where a mellow voice adds warmth to the smooth surface of the track. And on album highlight ""I Need Love"", a trio of singers provides backing for an amorous chanteuse, a brief interpolation of that early Motown sound. But, even when vocals aren't present, Riggins gives almost every track enough musical complexity to stand on its own. Everything here would sound great with a rapper over it, yet none of the tracks feel handicapped by the absence of lyrics.</p>
<p>The death of the MC is all too common a conversation, but the current ascendance of instrumental hip-hop producers is a phenomenon that's been ignored for too long. More and more artists (Thundercat, Knxwledge, and Eb7#9, to name a few) are combining the rigidity of traditional rap structures, with the progressive tendencies of jazz to create instrumental music that appeals to fans of both genres. Though Riggins occasionally explores the margins-- ""Water"" recalls the complex ambitions of someone like Flying Lotus-- he mostly keeps things simple, content to unleash tracks that, frankly, sound as if they could have been made by others.<i> </i>That said, it's a beautiful album, casually constructed and surging with an uncommon warmth, a success that will hopefully prompt Riggins to continue working alone, eschewing collaboration to deepen his explorations into unknown territory.</p></div>"|17367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17367-alone-together/|7.8|Jonah Bromwich

But I don't think making a great movie was his goal. It seems more likely RZA wanted to make an <i>awesome</i> movie, and the difference lies in a willingness to embrace the absurdity of the medium. RZA skirts the line between cliché and homage, conflating eye-popping violence with gut-busting laughter. Most critics have referred to <i>The Man With the Iron Fists</i> as a ""spectacle"" and rightfully so: A spectacle allows you to gawk at its audacious showmanship. There will be time for chin-stroking and nodding later.</p>
<p>The accompanying soundtrack boasts several things the movie lacks: continuity, professional editing, intelligible dialogue. <i>The Man With the Iron Fists OST </i>is a strong album and certainly the best Wu-affiliated product since <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13441-only-built-4-cuban-linx-pt-ii/"" target=""_blank"">Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II</a>, </i>but it never strives to be <i>awesome. </i>And for a RZA project, that means it can't be great either.</p>
<p>The conservative streak of <i>Iron Fists </i>is understandable on two levels: For one, it's RZA's first of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48389-rza-to-direct-genghis-khan-biopic-action-movie"">what may be many big-money Hollywood projects</a>. And he's recently gone on record saying the Wu could achieve one final triumph, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48247-rza-says-the-wu-tang-clan-could-return-in-full-force-but-only-if-hes-in-charge/"">provided he takes full command</a>. Whether the Wu's recent failures are more attributable to a lack of leadership or the decline of their MCing is up for debate, but the latter was the issue on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10975-8-diagrams/"" target=""_blank""><i>8 Diagrams</i></a>. While not as overt about siphoning prior goodwill as <i>Cuban Linx Pt. II</i>, <i>Iron Fists </i>does recall the last truly great Wu-Tang group project helmed by RZA, the <i>Ghost Dog OST</i>. This makes sense, since the format is both an advert for Wu's internal vitality and a display of what outsiders can legitimately be housed under their imprint. Though RZA produces only four tracks, his influence is obvious: <i>Iron Fists </i>is unified by a grainy, blaxploitation sonic blueprint that runs parallel to the movie's grindhouse aesthetic and allows for simmering soul pieces from Corinne Bailey Rae and the Revelations as well an appositely chipper Japanese pop song to sit alongside M.O.P. and Freddie Gibbs.</p>
<p>Still, the vast majority of the music here has an anti-heroism to run counter to its cinematic influences. RZA's character in <i>Iron Fists</i> is a blacksmith that channels an esoteric, cosmic energy to become a human weapon, but most of the songs here seem to identify with the Blacksmith's day job. ""Black Out"" features M.O.P., Ghostface, and Pharoahe Monch in a grouping that surely excites on name alone as does the Raekwon, Ghost, and Kool G Rap showcase ""Rivers of Blood"".  But the stakes feel a little low: the songs are perfunctory and workmanlike, and given the context of <i>The Man With the Iron Fists</i>, you wish they'd provide something more animated and celebratory.</p>
<p>Opener ""Baddest Man Alive"" aims for that territory, exhuming the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28271-blakroc/"" target=""_blank"">BlakRoc</a> project, which is still a fairly simple concept: rap over a slower Black Keys song. It's enjoyable hearing RZA using his <i>serious </i>voice while not taking himself so seriously, something akin to Bobby Digital rebranding himself as a Saturday morning cartoon (though he'd have to do away with lyrics like ""I date rape Beauty right in front of the Beast."") Otherwise, RZA looks outside his Clan to channel the film's base desires. Kanye West's ""White Dress"" is an outlier; though co-produced by RZA, its narrative conceit of European shopping sprees and club-hopping recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10658-graduation/"" target=""_blank""><i>Graduation </i></a>and its cyber-Asian artwork as opposed to the kung fu kitsch of <i>Iron Fists.</i> Unfortunately, Talib Kweli takes a vaguely similar approach on ""Get Your Way (Sex Is a Weapon)"", nicking a stray line from Jay-Z's ""Ain't No Nigga"" for a lame bout of puns. </p>
<p>The most interesting tracks on <i>Iron Fists </i>extend a temporary Wu visa to some of their more obvious progeny. There might not have been a father to Ol' Dirty Bastard's style, but it's possible to hear Danny Brown as an illegitimate son. And when he pops up at the end of the funereal Pusha T, Raekwon, and Joell Ortiz collaboration ""Tick, Tock"", it's transformative in a way that's almost too jarring. On the other end of the spectrum, Freddie Gibbs fits in all too well with Method Man and Streetlife. His technically-obsessed hardhead raps come off like a less off-kilter Masta Killa or a gullier Black Knights rather than the consummate gangsta rap loner guise he's made a career on. I'm at a loss to explain where Wiz Khalifa fits into all of this, since the B.o.B.-styled warbling hooks and dorm-room acoustic strums of ""I Go Hard"" convey the opposite message of its title.</p>
<p><i>Iron Fists </i>is competing against the movie's lurid visuals as well as the past work of everyone else involved. ""Black Out"" is a perfectly fine piece of beatdown rap in a situation that would've benefited from something more along the lines of ""Simon Says"" or ""Ante Up (Robbin Hoodz Theory)"". The full-on Wu-Tang posse cut ""Six Directions of Boxing"" is unerringly solid and composed, but could easily slide into the back end of <i>Wu-Tang Forever </i>relatively unnoticed; <i>The Man With the Iron Fists</i>, in all of its irresponsible R-rated gore,<i> </i>is more along the lines of ""Da Mystery of Chessboxin'"". There is indeed a Wu banger that plays during <i>Iron Fists</i>' absurdly violent instant classic of an opening battle, but is it anything that appears on this album? Nope, it's ""Shame on a Nigga"", Ol' Dirty Bastard ""live and uncut,"" serving as a muse whose inspiration is perhaps too prevalent on the movie and not enough on the soundtrack.</p></div>"|17433.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17433-the-man-with-the-iron-fists/|7.4|Ian Cohen

But now comes the comparatively modest <i>Smalhans, </i>Lindstrøm's second release in 2012 following this past winter's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16238-six-cups-of-rebel/"" target=""_blank""><i>Six Cups of Rebel</i></a>. The latter was a wildly experimental record from an artist known for subtle shifts, so <i>Smalhans</i> will inevitably be heard as a back-to-basics effort. Even ignoring that the song titles draw from traditional Norwegian dishes (Lindstrøm told <i>SPIN</i> that ""Ęg-gęd-ōsis"" consists of ""egg and sugar mixed together,"" which is as basic as you can get), the six tracks are no-frills versions of Lindstrøm doing what he does best: endlessly spiraling, cosmic dance that maintains an earthy humanity. </p>
<p>Occasionally, Lindstrøm's sense of comfort on <i>Smalhans</i> betrays him. The record's lead track and single, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14029-ra-ako-st/"" target=""_blank"">""Rà-àkõ-st""</a>, features a melody very close to ""Further Into the Future"", a cut from 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9559-its-a-feedelity-affair/"" target=""_blank"">It's a Feedelity Affair</a>. </i>But most of the time he sounds like an accomplished master at work. Take ""Fāār-i-kāāl"", a six-and-a-half minute trip that builds an endless melodic ladder before letting the floor drop out to unveil weightless bliss. This sort of build-and-release-- taking an arpeggiated melody and pushing it as far as it can go, until it's about to burst at the seams-- is a Lindstrøm speciality. <i>Smalhans</i> reaffirms that no one does it better. </p>
<p>The album was mixed by Norwegian kindred spirit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"" target=""_blank"">Todd Terje</a>, and there are plans to release extend Terje edits of every song on the album as 12"" singles. The pairing is timely. Terje's been in this game almost as long as Lindstrøm but 2012 has been very much his year. Following last year's gorgeous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12216-snooze-4-love/"" target=""_blank"">""Snooze 4 Love""</a>, the absolutely crushed-out-heavenly ""Inspector Norse"", from this year's solid <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16173-its-the-arps/"" target=""_blank""><i>It's the Arps</i></a> EP, stands to be one of the best singles of the year in any genre. Lindstrøm teaming with him is a case of game recognizing game. But he shouldn't be worried: <i>Smalhans</i> is a reliably generous gesture from an artist that takes pleasure in indulging himself and his audience. If you found <i>Six Cups </i>to be a troubling detour, here's your chance to breathe easy again.</p></div>"|17277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17277-smalhans/|7.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

I picked up the record when Hurricane Sandy was just a huge blip on the radar, but I listened more intently when I started scrolling through footage of the aftermath, unable to leave my apartment even after the government-mandated house arrest had elapsed. Howard has said in interviews that recording these songs gave him solace during a period in which he couldn't leave his home. ""Halls was a way of calming me down,"" he said. And here I was, kind of doing the same thing, except with a giant crane hanging like the Sword of Damocles just a few blocks away. <i>Ark </i>isn't a comforting album but it went with what I was seeing. ""It all feels as though it was written in the aftermath of some terrible upset or shock,"" <i>The Guardian</i>'s Paul Lester wrote.</p>
<p>It wasn't always this way. Halls, who left previous bands because he <span class=""s2"">doesn't ""work well with other people</span>,"" has been steadily honing his approach to making music with keyboards and a laptop. Last year's self-titled debut EP found him painting instrumental ambience with a broad, pretty, boring brush. On January's <i>Fragile</i> EP, he livened up his cinematic soundscape with a Sigur Rós sample, a live piano, and his own deeper, louder voice. <i>Ark</i>, Halls' debut full-length of just 10 months later, sounds like a different person wrote it. You can hear what he's saying most of the time. He lets the music fall out sometimes. The most telling difference, however, is the samples, which were recorded at churches and conservatories in the London area.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The minute-long ""Arc"" raises hairs with an original choral composition by Howard, which originally appeared in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13967-white-chalk/"" target=""_blank"">""White Chalk""</a> alongside a choir singing Mozart's ""Ave Verum Corpus"" at Blackheath's Conservatoire (for all his specificity in the liner notes, Halls doesn't clarify if the two pieces are sung by the same singers). And the title track fills a creaky ambient background with a sparse piano line recorded in the same venue. With a crow cawing in the background and steps receding in the background, it could be the last piano on earth. This all means that Howard's creation myths don't quite line up (if he couldn't leave his house, how did he go to church?) but the ends justify the means here. ""I"", for example, opens <i>Ark</i> with a field recording in St. Martin in the Fields in London, which supposedly sets the tone for the record. It's not much-- worshipers file in and out of church-- but it accomplishes a lot. Imagining Howard making the album alone in his room, replaying the conversations of he recorded of people around him, feels indescribably lonely.</p>
<p>As with a lot of depressive downbeat electronic music with vocals, Radiohead is the most obvious influence. Howard's rich yet hollow timbre, like a choirboy singing about emotions he's too young to understand, strikes a chord with Thom Yorke's, especially on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14218-roses-for-the-dead/"" target=""_blank"">""Roses for the Dead""</a> and ""Shadow of the Colossus"", both driven relentlessly to their emotional climaxes (""It's like a dashboard/ Something to take the blow"") with clicks and whispers. In Howard's description of ""I'm Not There"" he says he wrote the song for ""the voice of the dead."" He seems to takes it upon himself to convey them: ""In darkness, it is my voice, the only one/ The only one that knows the work that bends before the light,"" he cryptically sings on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14410-reverie/"" target=""_blank"">""Reverie""</a>, <i>Ark</i>'s most instrumentally barren song ""sung from the perspective of a person who has lost their life partner, and is left to contemplate their loss every night."" It's like the post-post-dubstep version of ""I'm Not There"", eschewing the percussion of James Blake's signature synth-led space for a guitars, live drums, and violins. Both find their inverse in the penultimate track ""Holy Communium"", which builds chiming and skittering to a drum crescendo worthy of Philip Selway.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that by the end of the album, these less-than-subtle paeans overshadow the intakes of breath from the choir on ""White Chalk"" or the wooden creaks of the pew in ""Winter Prayer"". Specific to Halls, those quieter moments are <i>Ark</i>'s most affecting and how it should be remembered. Howard has come a long, emotionally taxing way from the aptly named Sounds of Sweet Nothing, the label that released <i>Fragile</i>. Even though much of <i>Ark </i>was written and recorded then, Halls' sounds of nothing are no longer sweet. It's the attempt to fill what's left behind after something, be it a life partner or an entire seaside community, has been taken away.</p></div>"|17349.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17349-ark/|7.2|Harley Brown

""Funny"" has not been one of them. Yet there it is, in the opening minutes of label co-founder <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28648-pangaea/"" target=""_blank"">Pangaea</a>'s Release: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1330-missy-elliott/"" target=""_blank"">Missy Elliott</a>, imploring via sample, ""Do your thang/ Just make sure you ahead of the game."" Again and again, until Timbaland urges the same. The line comes from Missy and Tim's 2002 ode to big dicks/elephants, ""Work It"", and it's funny because a UK dance artist sampling Missy Elliott and Timabland-- or really any early-aughts US hip-hop-- could not be construed as being ""ahead of the game."" For a while, it seemed like that <i>was</i> the game.</p>
<p>Kevin McAuley, aka Pangaea, who runs Hessle with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29526-pearson-sound/"" target=""_blank"">Pearson Sound</a> and Ben UFO, knows this. In <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/10506-pangaea-interview-release-hessle-audio"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a recent interview with <i>the Quietus</i></a>, he admits that, while he subscribes to the ""do your thang"" philosophy, the ""ahead of the game""-mantra is a red herring, a sly dig at a scene that spends too much time chasing innovation. Sampling Missy, in a perverted way, takes McAuley out of the running.</p>
<p>It is the only thing that takes him out of the running. Pangaea's debut album, by all measures except McAuley's own, is a wily and undefinable example of progressive underground dance music. His best work imagines a world in which UK garage mates with the scraped-knee utility of 1990s techno instead of sinking into the city-low hues of dubstep. It's a beguiling mix, one that marries the syncopated rhythmic template and radio-bait of garage with chilly, alien textures.</p>
<p>More than any Hessle production before it, <i>Release</i> is singular, almost standoffish. There are no DJ tools here, very little grist for the Rinse FM mill. This is McAuley stepping outside his comfort zone because he-- and indeed the entire Hessle crew-- has built a reputation on providing not only forward-thinking dance music, but forward-thinking dance music that plays nicely with its UK club peers. <i>Release</i> stays sour and pugnacious throughout its eight tracks. There are nods to classic UK dubstep-- the yawning pulses that dominate the second half of the title track, the stoned tempo of ""Middleman""-- but its McAuley's devotion to briney tectures and anti-climaxes that define <i>Release</i>. This is techno-as-worldview, a struggle with machines, not dystopian but properly pessimistic.</p>
<p>McAuley fancies cut-up vocals like many of his peers, but he doesn't shade them into darkness like, say, Burial; he forces them through a meat grinder, and they come out the other side pink and compressed. Nowhere more so than on the final track, ""High"", a beatless horrorshow that juxtaposes warm electronic pulses with mangled vocals. This brutal treatment goes on for more than seven minutes-- the longest track on the album. The sample appears to be from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB1r4k1nswQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an old club track</a>, shitty and obscure enough that it repeals the populism of the opening gambit.</p>
<p>While Pangaea and Hessle's peers have resorted to mealy, house-music gruel (Hotflush) and thinly veiled populism (Hyperdub), <i>Release</i> offers willful, self-conscious antagonism of the purest variety. It's newness by necessity. (And it's no shock that among all the artists featured in <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1229"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Resident Advisor's Machine Love</a> series, McAuley unapologetically features the most spartan and modern rig.) He has professed a desire to return to track-based techno, the place where his dexterity and rankle can be best put to use. <i>Release</i> is leaden and brute, and Pangaea has never been the type to carry anchors. Be glad McAuley leaves them lying around for us.</p></div>"|17395.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17395-release/|7.7|Andrew Gaerig

In a veil of naivety, the British duo gave itself a <a href=""http://conlonnancarrow.org/nancarrow/Home.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Conlon Nancarrow complex</a>, assuming that no drummer could adequately perform their pre-programmed overload of black metal, grindcore and obliterative noise in real time. So rather than stand on stage with a drum machine, vocalist V.I.T.R.I.O.L., or Dave Hunt, and multi-instrumental mastermind Irrumator, or Mick Kenney, sequestered themselves with studio time. They created hyperbolically convulsive and complicated records that didn't heed the need to make sense onstage; instead, they twisted elements of extreme music together until they'd created a horrifying mongrel that sounded like little else. Their best albums, such as 2004's <i>Domine Non Es Dignus</i> and 2009's brilliant <i>In the Constellation of the Black Widow</i>, transgress a dozen forms of heavy at a brutal, unrepentant clip.</p>
<p>Anaal Nathrakh eventually started playing live, refuting their own hypothesis by recruiting a quite-capable rhythm section that now joins the band for shows but not on albums; rare one-offs morphed into the kind of short treks that, later this month, will send the pair to Canada for the first time. Still, <a href=""http://www.metalreviews.com/interviews/interviews.php?id=132"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the effect of that early decision</a>-- to limit the membership to two and to thrive or perish based only on how immoderate the records could be-- remains: Anaal Nathrakh's albums are labyrinths of hyperactivity and idiosyncrasy, each part veering and sprinting into an unexpected next direction. Hunt, who's currently completing a Master's Degree in Philosophy, builds worlds of literary references and poetic citations, multi-tracking them over Kenney's one-man audio horror show. It's strange, fearless music-- exactly the sort of stuff that too much additional input might temper by limiting the unbound eccentricity.</p>
<p>The band's latest album, <i>Vanitas</i>, is neither its best nor its most frenzied, but it's still incredibly aggressive. The energy and urgency are as high as ever; during these 38 minutes, there's rarely a chance for rest or, more impressive, to predict what's coming. But perhaps for the first time, the previous decade's output does presage <i>Vanitas</i>, meaning that Hunt and Kenney haven't found a new way to ratchet the intensity higher, or to make their shrieking nightmares that much more frightening. Sure, ""Feeding the Beast"" incorporates a classic industrial breakdown in its first half, while ""Todos Somos Humanos"" builds toward its seismic rumble through glitches, sampler manipulation and a moment of stoner throb. And this might be the most conspicuously hook-driven Anaal Nathrakh album to date, too: A melody fit for hair metal emerges from the unintelligible screams and death metal snap of  ""Forging Towards the Sunset"", crisscrossing layers of serrated vocals and clean-singing harmonies suggesting metalcore as swallowed by the abyss. During ""In Coelo Quies, Tout Finis Ici Bas"", Kenney's stacks of pummel and misdirection generally strangle Hunt, who spends the bulk of the song screaming like he's wheezing. A hook crests above the mess, Hunt belting his credo like a true Bruce Dickinson apostle. Previously for Anaal Nathrakh, those intense tangents and sudden switches sounded like revelations; on <i>Vanitas</i>, they simply sound like Anaal Nathrakh, a band that has been around long enough to turn its tricks into tropes.</p>
<p>That's not meant to be dismissive or to suggest somehow that Anaal Nathrakh have gotten soft. Even if it feels familiar, <i>Vanitas</i> is a thrill ride of horrors, still unencumbered by restraint or regard for how these songs might work outside of the studio. ""We want a sensation or feeling rather than things you can figure out,"" <a href=""http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2011/05/interview-anaal-nathrakh/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hunt told Invisible Oranges last year</a>, explaining Anaal Nathrakh's approach. Indeed, innovations aside, <i>Vanitas</i> remains incredibly challenging and evocative: In less than three minutes, for instance, ""Make Glorious the Embrace of Saturn"" sweeps from D-beat to black metal and back again, a transition that's most interesting when those layers clash against one another. As the title might suggest, ""You Can't Save Me, So Stop Fucking Trying"" is relentlessly mean, the title serving both as a mantra for malevolence and a swivel for the song's switches between old-school thrash, Lightning Bolt-like weirdness and death metal chug. If that sounds a tad impossible, you probably haven't heard Anaal Nathrakh yet. As a stylistic culmination of sorts, <i>Vanitas</i> is a fine place to start.</p></div>"|17319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17319-vanitas/|7.0|Grayson Currin

We've grown accustomed to conflating an artist's musical progression with their changing appearances-- like when they go through <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbzvSYLCSo0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a beardo phase</a>, or get <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlyKwXND5xs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ill-advised new-wave haircuts</a>, or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHVv7Mz2_Bo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">start wearing guyliner</a>. But Clinic always look like Clinic, which reinforces the idea that they always <i>sound</i> like Clinic. Even when the band embraced soft-pop melody and open-hearted lyricism on 2010's knowingly titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14691-bubblegum/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bubblegum</i></a>, it seemed to only amplify this band's inherent, ineffable strangeness. </p>
<p>Those masks aren't just a gimmicky extension of Clinic's name; they're also a visual manifestation of the band's meticulous approach, as they've taken a scalpel to music from the 1960s and 70s-- the Monks, Sparks, Joe Meek, krautrock-- and stitched their favorite bits into new, mutant forms. But compared to the concise structures of their six previous albums, on <i>Free Reign</i>, the band behaves less like surgeons and more like scientists who favor exploration and patience. The game plan this time is to switch their analog synths to the ""Suicide"" setting and see where the drones take them. </p>
<p>The more open-ended ethos also extends to the band's choice of mixer: Daniel Lopatin aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>. Lopatin's avant-electronic soundscaping has little in common with Clinic's compact collage-rock, but his influence seems less about sound than spirit. Clinic show a greater willingness to let these songs unfurl according to their own logic and pace: The slow-percolating opener, ""Misty"", doesn't reveal its chiming, churchly Spiritualized-like keyboard hook until a good two minutes in, which is usually the point when Clinic are wrapping a song up. It's also the first of four songs here to crack the five-minute mark, heretofore uncharted territory in the Clinic canon.</p>
<p>But as <i>Free Reign</i> shows, when Clinic take their time, they can build up a bewitching groove. The album's twin highlights, ""Miss You"" and ""You"", are similarly titled, similarly structured, and similarly libidinous exercises in disco-Can decadence; while a touch too slow for dancefloor traction, they both get impressively freakier and funkier the longer they stretch out. ""Seamless Boogie Woofie BBC2 10"" works the same trick in more abbreviated form, while proving that even a chorus of ""you're beautiful"" can sound creepily sinister when coming from ever-enigmatic vocalist Ade Blackburn.</p>
<p>But if <i>Free Reign</i> posits Clinic as unlikely heirs to the LCD Soundsystem legacy of post-punky electro-rock, it also reveals the mess they made along the way. ""See Saw"" practically kills the album's momentum before it even gets going, with a maddeningly repetitious caveman stomp that sounds like a practice-space goof. ""Cosmic Radiation"" and ""Sun and the Moon"" meanwhile, offer glimpses of Clinic as jam band, with Blackburn's omnipresent melodica squawking over the former's aimless, wah-wah'ed jazz-funk rhythm, while the latter's loose blues ramble imagines the late-era Doors gone dub.</p>
<p>But in between <i>Free Reign</i>'s two extremes-- of taut groove and directionless doodle-- Clinic also add to their deepening catalog of disarmingly affecting ballads with ""For the Season"", a wistful whisper of a song that inspires scenes of slow dances in empty ballrooms. It may be the most atypical track here, but on an album that so doggedly documents the process of experimentation, it's a welcome moment where Clinic can let down the mask and enjoy a breather.</p></div>"|17291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17291-free-reign/|7.1|Stuart Berman

This may seem like an insignificant detail, but in Gucci terms, this marks a major evolutionary event. Facial tattoos notwithstanding, he's cautious and conservative when it comes to change, and it takes a few spins through <i>Trap God</i> before the differences between it and past records come into focus. But once they do, they cohere into a portrait of an artist in the midst of an aesthetic metamorphosis.</p>
<p>Gucci isn't prone to the kind of daring innovations that have made Kanye the rap-game Apple Inc., a market-dominating behemoth who drops a zeitgeist-altering product about once a year. He's more like a niche company that builds devices for hardcore gamers, and offers a larger selection of goods that differ from each other only incrementally, but which aim at satisfying the needs of a more specialist crowd. </p>
<p>And if anything, Gucci's been almost too consistently good at delivering. Ever since he first started getting attention on a national scale in 2009, during an especially prolific period where he put out eight LPs' worth of material in a 12-month span, he could be counted on to release albums, mixtapes, and guest verses at such a blinding rate and that so reliably hit all of the marks his audience has come to expect-- the car noises, the ""s'Gucci"" ad libs, the good-but-not-incredible lyrics peppered with the requisite number of punchlines-- that they tend to blur together.</p>
<p><i>Trap God</i> has the lyrics and the punchline frequency (as well as the nasally congested, marble-mouthed flow), but it's short on the trademark Gucci vocal tics. In fact, sometimes it seems like there isn't enough Gucci in general-- not counting the brief ""Intro"", there are only four tracks that don't feature a guest rapper or singer, and three of them come in the back half of the record. And on some of the tracks he doesn't feel completely present, an effect that's exacerbated when he teams up with Meek Mill, Rick Ross, and his former protégé Waka Flocka Flame, three artists with outsize personalities who are currently at the top of their respective games. And the tracks where he comes out unambiguously on top-- including the handful alongside newly signed 1017 Brick Squad second-stringer Young Scooter-- the matchups feel lopsided.</p>
<p>The bright side is that <i>Trap God</i>'s best songs are among the best in Gucci's catalog. Probably not coincidentally they also tend to be the ones where Gucci challenges himself the most. On the chiptune-inflected ""Suckaz"" (produced by Shawty Redd) and ""Act Up"" (produced by T-Pain, who also provides a killer vocal on the chorus), he sounds energetic and loose, hovering weightlessly over the beat. And when he squares off with Waka Flocka and internet mixtape sensation Kirko Bangz on the 808 Mafia-produced ode to no-strings-attached sex, ""Fawk Something"", he comes through with a remarkably profane verse that includes a brief and totally hilarious swing at impersonating a dancehall rapper. </p>
<p>When Gucci puts his mind to writing a chorus these days, he's coming up with better stuff than he ever has before. ""Rolly Up"" may have the most irritatingly unshakeable hook this side of Jibbs' ""Chain Hang Low"", but the back-to-back cuts ""Money Habits"" and ""Crazy"" are spiked with eccentrically catchy, off-key candy pop passages that suggest he might be the spiritual heir to Ol' Dirty Bastard at his karaoke-crooner best. Still, while Gucci Mane's recently been stuck in a particularly enjoyable rut, a rut is still a rut. It's good to see him start to pull himself out of it, even if it's slow going, inch by inch.</p></div>"|17397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17397-trap-god/|7.2|Miles Raymer

That year, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"" target=""_blank"">Madonna</a>'s late-career foray into Eurodance, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5030-confessions-on-a-dance-floor/"" target=""_blank""><i>Confessions on a Dancefloor</i></a> marked the last time she'd be ahead of the curve, while French Touch veteran Alan Braxe attracted indie types to glittery hedonism with his stellar singles comp <i>The Upper Cuts. </i>Meanwhile, the teeth-grinding one-two French electro-punch of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2223-justice/"" target=""_blank"">Justice</a>'s antagonistic <i>Waters of Nazareth</i> 12"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>'s oft-maligned <i>Human After All</i> now sound strangely prescient. </p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4529-vitalic/"" target=""_blank"">Vitalic</a>, real name Pascal Arbez, fit in with those last two artists in the middle of the last decade. Four years after releasing the stacked <i>Poney</i> EP, he dropped <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8538-ok-cowboy/"" target=""_blank""><i>OK Cowboy</i></a>, a dizzying collection of loopy, buzzy electro that would work for any 2010s HARD Fest attendee. If that album was a series of bright, loud firecrackers, then 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13704-flashmob/"" target=""_blank""><i>Flashmob</i></a> resembled a slow-burning candle, as it found the French producer adding shades of sultry disco to his palette. It was a fine album, but the low-key aesthetic and lack of big singles lessened its impact.</p>
<p>Three years later, we have <i>Rave Age</i>, Arbez's third proper LP as Vitalic. The title seems to address youth culture's current embrace of big-box electronic music, and the record looks toward past glories, too. <i>Rave Age</i>'s first two singles, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13948-no-more-sleep/"" target=""_blank"">""No More Sleep""</a> and ""Stamina"", bring to mind <i>OK Cowboy</i>'s more audacious moments, right down to the latter's cheesy ""Crank it up!"" vocal sample. ""Rave Kids Go"" aims for a similar mood but the slow buzzsaw builder is anchored by a rare lead vocal, courtesy of Michael Karkousse of Belgian outfit Goose. Karkousse's vocal initially recalls the kind of smoky vocal take you'd hear on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"" target=""_blank"">Chemical Brothers</a> album but when he moves from sleazy to shouty on the song's bridge, it comes across as forced. </p>
<p>The streamlined vocal cuts don't all work, but at least Arbez seems engaged on them. The gritty ""La Mort Sur Le Dance Floor"" features a snotty performance from French singer Rebeka Warrior that should be avoided as long as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5657-crystal-castles/"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Castles</a> are going, but ""Under Your Sun"" fares better thanks to airy, hollow production and a perfectly competent high-register touch from fellow countrywoman Owlle. The standout from the pop cuts is ""Fade Away"", featuring an arena-scale tender take from Shitdisco's Joe Reeves. It works in part because it's the most straightforwardly gorgeous thing on the record, but for me the real appeal is how its structure parallels <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne/"" target=""_blank"">Saint Etienne</a>'s head-in-the-clouds remix of the Drums' ""Forever and Ever Amen"".</p>
<p>And that's the album's biggest problem: <i>Rave Age</i> makes you wish you were listening to other songs. The closer you listen to the wobbly hip-hop textures, overly-busy techno, and generic dark ambience, the less the album needs to exist. Maximalism has frequently been Arbez's thing-- it's the quality that made him rise to some sort of prominence to begin with. But on <i>Rave Age</i>, he does too much of everything and sounds mostly like a whole lot of nothing. </p></div>"|17259.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17259-rave-age/|4.7|Larry Fitzmaurice
