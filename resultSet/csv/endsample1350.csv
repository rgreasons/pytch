is Kevin's five-track, sixteen-minute

 billet-doux
</i>
not only to cheap pre-prepared sounds
    but also to her one-time fave guy, Miguel Trost Depedro (aka Kid 606).  Kevin's got a whole lotta love to
    express here and she's pretty direct with it. Rather than crafting the awkward sound sculptures usually
    associated with her Blechdom cohort Blevin, Kevin goes straight for bargain-basement rinky-dink tunes and
    slaps some louche lyrics on the top. The disc sounds as though it took sixteen minutes to record. It's a
    no-frills celebration of tacky synth modules and crude humor.  Like a surly, room-quaking fart during a
    business meeting,
<i>

</i>
is an antidote to the fussy high-brow IDM
    that garners most critical attention.</p><p>
 Beginning with ""Interspecies Love"", a pro-bestiality ditty stomped out on an out-of-tune piano, Momus'
    discarded drum machine, and a spastic banjo, Kevin sings, ""Mom's going to kill me when she hears this song,""
    and then gets straight to the heart of the matter: ""You've got a hard shell but your belly's soft/ I'm just
    trying to figure out what gets you off!"" Kevin delivers these lines in a voice that's part quivering Laura
    Nyro and part declamatory Siouxsie Sioux.</p><p>
 During ""Talkin' Tech"", a 47-second distorted-funk slop Kevin acerbically rebukes the IDM community: ""I like
    the algorithms when they make the funky rhythms/ But most of the time techno-logy don't rhyme! You're
    anti-melody malady/ You're dismal, minimal, subliminal, delirious, self-serious/ You think you know/ But
    you really blow.""  But the next track, ""Mr. Miguel"", is a raunchy love song to Kid606 in which Kevin
    confides ""Mr. Miguel/ We're doing just swell/ And it's only getting better/ Because my pussy's feeling
    wetter."" Kevin is either quite a contrarian or really digs guys who, by her own admission, blow.  To
    orchestrate the bawdy nonsense rhyme ""Shelley Sho'nuf"", Kevin draws on Weimar cabaret, ska, and funfair
    organ tunes, and holds them together with a ramshackle beat.

 closes with a cover of Tina Turner's ""Private Dancer"" which
    exists solely to demonstrate how many presets Kevin can tinker with.  She almost gets away with using the
    DX-7 harmonica preset for a horrendous solo without causing me to retch.  Yet, when she sings, it's with
    nearly enough passion and verve to convince me she's not being entirely sarcastic.  And that's what I find
    so endearing about this record.
</p>
<p>
 Because Kevin takes far cheaper and cornier shots than Blevin, I break out Blevin's
 <i>
  Talom Slalom
 </i>
 album more often than Kevin's EP. Where Blevin's album creeps and squirms,
 <i>

 struts like a savvy hooker, turning tricks in the gutter but with her head up gazing at the
    stars.  At the very least, Kevin has made me mildly appreciative of presets.

I was
    driving home at night, the headlights of my Camry illuminating parts of trees and branches on the sides of
    the road, but also leaving vast, inky swathes of shadow in which I could see nothing.  It was there that I
    realized that, despite all the statistics and such, I felt safer in densely developed areas like my Boston
    neighborhood than I did in the woods.  In the city, there were people everywhere-- if something terrible
    happened, someone was likely to see.  Out here, though, there was uncertainty.  You couldn't see what was
    out in those woods, and if anything happened to you, it could conceivably be days before anyone found you.
    And mind you, this was in Connecticut, which doesn't exactly have the deepest swathes of wilderness in the
    Union.</p><p>
    
    16 Horsepower's David Eugene Edwards seems to understand this mentality deeply and taps into it quite like
    no other songwriter I've heard.  His music inhabits the darkest corners of the American backwoods, places
    where shots from the Civil War and the Western frontier still echo, where it's miles to help in any direction.
    The haunted, creaky music on <i>Folklore</i>, his fifth album with this band, calls out from the traditions
    of Appalachian and Scottish folk, but with a bizarre, hard-to-pin sound that suggests goth country, as
    opposed to Southern Gothic.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, it's practically a distillation of Harry Smith's <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i>, with
    themes running from the persecution of sinners by God and demons, to murder on unimproved roads, to country
    paranoia. It's not a bad fit with the imagery of the Civil War documentary PBS has been rerunning this week.
    There's a reason for this-- four of the ten songs are covers of traditional tunes that likely date back that
    far.  Sixteen Horsepower also try their hand at the Carter Family's ""Single Girl"", which is featured on the
    third volume of Smith's anthology.  It's one of the few moments on <i>Folklore</i> where the band picks
    themselves up out of the dirgy murk.  It has them galloping along on a jaunty banjo-driven carriage, very
    nearly approximating that strange, almost-in-tune-but-not-quite singing that colored the original Carter
    Family recordings.</p><p>
    
    Otherwise, <i>Folklore</i>'s a rather dour affair, reaching its most extreme depths on the song that
    immediately follows ""Single Girl"", the aptly titled ""Beyond the Pale"".  Electric piano, brushed drums and
    vibraphone create a background wasteland, through which Edwards' weary voice travels, harassed by random
    intonations from an acoustic guitar.  ""Beyond the pale/ We keep down our voices/ For that is our way/ Lost
    in the backwoods/ You awoke and found me there/ Setting the woods on fire,"" sings Edwards as though
    struggling to breathe.</p><p>
    
    The four traditional offerings come mostly from the Anglo-American folk canon, though ""La Robe a Parasol"" is
    a freaky Cajun waltz.  The two best come in succession: a droning, desolate take on ""Horse Head Fiddle"" that
    sounds nearly medieval with its backing drone and moaning vocals, and a thrilling version of Nina Simone's
    ""Sinnerman"".  The band begins the latter slowly with acoustic guitar and piano, gradually building rhythmic
    steam until finally breaking into a full stomp with driving drums and banjo..</p><p>
    
    Taken as a whole, <i>Folklore</i> doesn't represent so much a new direction for Sixteen Horsepower so much
    as a narrowing of focus to concentrate on their most doom-laden tendencies.  The album crawls from the
    speakers like a stabbing victim and gives up a great moan; it's a difficult listen, but the rewards are
    great-- see the subversively rhythmic backing of ""Blessed Persistence"" and the band's lush version of Hank
    Williams' ""Alone and Forsaken"".  Another album like this might prove too much, but these ten songs are just
    about right.</p></div>"|7212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7212-folklore/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    It wasn't easy tracking down Mega Man.  His publicist said
    he would be unreachable until the release of the forthcoming ""Mega Man Thugz""
    in 2003.  So we went vigilante.  After asking around Mega's usual haunts--
    Gutsman's, Bombman's, etc-- with little luck, we finally ran into him outside
    of Dr Light's facility in Hollis, Queens, sitting on the stoop with a brown
    paper-sheathed bottle of Old English Steel Reserve in his hand-apparatus,
    boombox blasting.  That's our Mega Man.</p><p>
<font size=""-1"">MEGAMAN: Yeeeeah boy, what you got?</font></p><p>
    NINTENDO POWER: Yo, Meg, Nintendo Power here.  Just wondering if we could have
    a few minutes to catch up with you on your life, get the scoop on any projects
    you might be involved in, y'know?</p><p>
    MM: Nothin' but love for Nintendo Power, 's all I'm sayin.  Word is bond.</p><p>
    NP: Thanks much.  Now, a lot of people are pointing you out today as the first
    video game character to incorporate a ""hip-hop aesthetic"", if you will, into
    your image, predating even Parappa the Rapper.  You were the first to use
    ""sampling"" technology, borrowing attacks from the enemies you defeated...</p><p>
    MM: Yeah, I got shit from Cut Man, Heat Man, Wood Man, Beenie Man, Afro Man,
    Redman, Method Man...</p><p>
    NP: Indeed you did.  But that was all quite a while back.  What are you into
    now?  For example, what's this you're listening to?</p><p>
    MM: You ain't heard K-Rad yet?  These kids gonna score my next game, yo.  It's
    a different role for me. I play this robot pimp from the year 20XX who gets
    sent back to the 80s.</p><p>
    NP: Yeah, this does sound like an instrumental homage to that period-- or, as
    such, a throwback to the mid-90s: the simple beats, the flute samples, the
    quaint vocal snippets...</p><p>
    MM: Forget that.  It's all right, but check out this next shit.  They did this
    with some old Amiga software.  16 bits, motherfucker.</p><p>
    NP: Ah, yes, well, the sounds are very mechanical, and the style is certainly
    very harsh, a little closer to hardcore techno now than hip-hop.  But the
    overall effect isn't quite the bland steel-on-silicon grind that sort of thing
    usually turns out to be, maybe because the structure keeps changing, or maybe
    because of all those submerged vocal samples...</p><p>
    MM: Aww, just <i>listen</i> to this shit!  This one's called ""Vous""; reminds me
    of the time I got together with that Metroid chick...</p><p>
    NP: Certainly more of a relaxed funk bent on this one, which is unexpected...
    oh, and I like the way it just dissolves without warning into this gentle
    outro.  But, wait, are you saying this makes you nostalgic?  It sounds like
    they're attempting a decidedly futuristic sound to me.</p><p>
    MM: There's no kind of nostalgia like nostalgia for the future.  You sure you
    played Nintendo back in the day, man?</p><p>
    NP: Well, I'm mainly wondering whether all of this futurism isn't a little
    misleading.  I mean, there's nothing here that will really advance electronic
    music, this isn't anything that \xB5-Ziq hasn't done before.</p><p>
    MM: But it ain't predictable, neither.  Listen to how that synth leaps like
    Big Baby Jesus over a rehab center wall.  These kids compose a whole new show
    every time they play, and they ain't even started to repeat themselves yet.</p><p>
    NP: All right, so it's moderately intelligent dance music.</p><p>
    MM: 'Cept you can actually dance to it.  Sometimes, I just wanna dance.</p><p>
    So do we all, Mega Man.  So do we all.</p></div>"|4371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4371-deli-mood-spot/|7.8|Brendan Reid

No matter what the man does, no matter how strong he comes, people still come back
    with, ""It ain't <i>Illmatic</i>."" It's an unfair way to judge someone's work, though you can hardly deny that
    statement's accuracy.  After all, the 90s only spawned a handful of other hip-hop records that can even be
    mentioned in the same breath as Nas' 1994 classic.  With songs like ""Life's a Bitch"", ""One Love"", and ""N.Y.
    State of Mind"", and producers like Pete Rock, Primo, and Large Professor, <i>Illmatic</i> not only signified
    Nas at his nastiest and most poetic, but it also represented the pinnacle of 90s NYC hip-hop.  The falloff
    has been a bitch; Nas' sins include releasing what can politely be considered a string of mediocre albums,
    ghostwriting for Will Smith, and immersing himself in enough beefs to keep a fleet of hip-hop gossip
    columnists busy for years.</p><p>
    
    But, after all these disappointments, we still hold out hope for the return of hip-hop's prodigal son.  And
    <i>The Lost Tapes</i> does, on the surface, seem like a possible candidate for that revival.  Ostentatiously
    released for the real headz, this collection features tracks only previously released on mixtapes or over
    the Internet.  Hopefully, this means none of the jiggy, commercial-friendly nonsense that's really dragged
    down his records the past few years.</p><p>
    
    The album's first track, ""Doo Rags"", finds Nas doing what he does best: reminiscing about his youth in the
    ghetto over a jazzy, piano-based loop.  Nas namechecks Beat Street Breakers and the X-Clan while railing
    against ""political thugs in shark suits [who] persuade us to pull triggers.""  At the end of the second
    verse, he raps, ""Your paper money was the death of Christ/ And all these shorties comin' up just resurrect
    your life/ It's like a cycle."" After the science of ""Doo Rags"", the resurrection of Rakim's only true
    successor seems like a real possibility.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, Nas' return is pretty short-lived. On the next track, ""My Way"", Nas returns to his pimped-out,
    diamond-studded-glocks persona.  He raps, ""Living my life like everyday is my last night/ Alcoholic on toilets
    I shit blood/ Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug.""  Yeah, okay.  But it must be said that
    Nas does add a little more to the gangsta formula than most.  In the second verse of the song, he gives a
    vivid retelling of the death of his friend Ill Will, whose name Nas has used for his record label, and
    concedes that he ""still feels broke with millions in the bank."" The Alchamist (aka Primo-in-Training)
    provides a nice but somewhat generic beat.</p><p>
    
    Ever the provocateur, Nas does take a couple of shots at his rivals. On ""Purple"", he raps, ""I don't like the
    way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers,"" while on ""Everybody's Crazy"", he insults someone by calling
    them a ""Sisqo fag.""  In ""Black Zombie"", Nas veers back towards black conscious, deriding the media's
    stereotypes of African-American as gangstas and hoes, the inequality in the educational system, and
    black-on-black violence. After hearing Nas spin gangsta narratives on ""Blaze a 50"" and ""My Way"", and after
    being subjected to the hype surrounding his long string of self-provoked beefs, it isn't hard to spot the
    hypocrisy in these otherwise noble sentiments. But, when you think about it, haven't the boldest and greatest
    of us been mired in contradictions: Lenin, Bill Clinton, Bob Dylan, Tupac Shakur...</p><p>
    
    So, maybe we can forgive Nas of his moral contradictions.  But what's a little harder to swallow are some of
    the beats on this album.  The Barry White sample on ""No Idea's Original"" is nice, but it doesn't fit Nas'
    flow on the track.  And while ""Blaze a 50"" is an interesting narrative involving betrayal, sex, and murder,
    the generic violin-based track almost ruins it.  Despite its flaws, though, <i>The Lost Tapes</i> is nice.
    Not a return to form, per se, but possibly as close as we're likely to get.  Besides, after all the years and
    disappointments, the expectations for Nas have finally subsided.  What I'm saying is, if you can manage to
    forget <i>Illmatic</i>, you might actually like the guy again.</p></div>"|5709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5709-the-lost-tapes/|6.9|Sam Chennault

    them; that's not really what they're ""about"".  But if you figured that their third outing, <i>Reveille</i>,
    would consist of more of the same synapse-frying screeches and rock-driven salvos of noise they've built
    their name on, you could be forgiven for being wrong.  See, there's this line somewhere between ""accessibility""
    and <i>The Man, The King, and The Girl</i>, and if Deerhoof haven't quite stepped across it with this album,
    they're moving in the right direction.</p><p>
<i>Reveille</i> still offers plenty of clattering fury-- just not as much as you may be used to.  This time
    around, the gleeful chaos of their last two Christmas cards from the asylum has been tempered into something
    more endearingly bizarre.  The record careens through sixteen tracks (most of which don't even break two
    minutes) whose frantic disparity is matched only by their seeming pop innocence.  No track is like the one
    preceding-- or anything else on the album, for that matter-- and even though most of tracks make liberal
    use of the standard rock armaments (guitars, bass, and lots of drums), few can be so readily described.</p><p>
    
    Deerhoof confounds the casual toss-off of classifiers with a boatload of additional instrumentation: bells,
    toy xylophones, flutes, strings, and organs, all employed in the most conspicuous way possible.  But this
    veil of eccentricity is like the invisible paint on the stealth bomber, cloaking insidiously sweet melodies
    (primarily carried by much of the ""accessory"" instrumentation) past all defenses, allowing Deerhoof to
    deliver its payload of weird-pop hooks directly to your subconscious.  Between Satomi Matsuzaki's
    candy-coated vocals (the earlier limitations of which she seems to have outgrown), and simple arrangements
    that permit the myriad elements of this album to shine, there's a remarkable wealth of gorgeous melody.</p><p>
    
    In fact, the album falters just twice, and barely at that.  ""No One Fed Me So I Stayed"" isn't so much music
    as it is the muffled sounds of a strange, tortured creature bound and gagged in a cedar chest.  Nevertheless,
    in the album's context, it's surprisingly funny (at least, I laughed, if only out of disbelief-- hilarious
    or harrowing; take your pick), it just disturbs the pace of the album by being too weird, even among
    <i>Reveille</i>'s other brain-damaging moments.  Slightly more serious is the awkward lull caused by the
    eight-minute ""The Last Trumpeter Swan"".  It's a pleasantly straightforward, hypnotic piece of guitar work,
    primarily, though the least musically engaging piece Deerhoof offer here.  Of course, it wouldn't even be
    an issue if weren't also the album's temporal core, and the only real stall to be found amongst the general
    panic.</p><p>
    
    It's hard to care much about <i>Reveille</i>'s few missteps, though, when confronted with the staggeringly
    beautiful composition of the remainder of the album.  Every cut is a true experience, uniquely inventive
    and sublime.  From the glitch-addled guitar work on ""Holy Night Fever"", to the spacy chanting of ""Our Angel's
    Ululu"", to ""Top Tim Rubies"" (which was surely rescued from Clinic's dustbin), you're staring down the barrel
    of total awesomeness.  Okay, so that oversells it a little, but not by much.  Let's just say this:
    <i>Reveille</i>'s scope needs to be heard to be appreciated.</p></div>"|2249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2249-reveille/|8.5|Eric Carr

Call me jaded if you will, but I don't believe it. There are twists and
    turns, sure, but surprises? Most of us, we work all day, whether for our own edification or for hard-earned
    cash. We read and watch things, and get drunk and perhaps kiss someone, maybe even fall in and out of love.
    Nothing too eyebrow-raising.  Alright, so maybe I'm just getting caught up in the bleak world of the Black
    Heart Procession. The Patriots, after all, beat the Rams in the last Super Bowl. That was a pleasant surprise.
    And the September 11th attacks were, in a blasphemous understatement, an unpleasant surprise.  But
    <a href=""http://cooperativeresearch.org/completetimeline"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>some people even saw that coming</u></a>,
    unfortunate as that certainly is.</p><p>
    
    Did anyone expect the Black Heart Procession's new album to sound like this, though?  I'm willing to venture
    that few people who aren't in with the band expected such a departure. For one thing, the Procession have
    actually graced their latest work with a non-numerical title, as opposed to their first three albums: 1998's
    <i>1</i>, 1999's <i>2</i>, and 2000's <i>3</i>.  (Well, ok, <i>Three</i> was actually spelled instead of
    written numerically.)  And then, there's the music.  Now, the change from <i>3</i> to <i>Amore del Tropico</i>
    isn't so dramatic as the change from, say, <i>OK Computer</i> to <i>Kid A</i>, but there's no question that
    <i>Amore</i> is a much different sound and a very welcome progression from the dirges that graced their
    three previous full-lengths.</p><p>
    
    The Procession was once funereal through and through, keeping the same slow pace and lonely lyrics throughout.
    Here, however, they've taken their march somewhere south of the border.  Judging from the instrumentation and
    odd flourishes, the narrator of <i>Amore</i> has ventured to a small Central American country of beauty and
    intrigue.  Wherever he is, one thing's for sure: things are not going quite as planned.  The first track,
    after all, is called ""The End of Love"", a 12-second instrumental spurt that introduces the listener to what
    will be a 55-minute tale of lost love and vengeful murder. The subsequent titular track, ""Tropics of Love""
    (in translation), opens with the band's trademark instrument, the saw. But then deft strings and hip-swinging
    percussion set a sexy, noir-ish scene suffused with whispering men and crooning female gypsies. ""Was it here
    where we left our hearts?"" sings Pall Jenkins. ""Was it here in the tropics of love?"" Something bad is coming,
    if it hasn't come already.</p><p>
    
    Things are bit shady in <i>Amore del Tropico</i>'s storyline, but like a good Lynch-style thriller, time
    doesn't clarify a damn thing. On ""Broken World"", the narrator seems to be resentfully coming to grips with
    his upended emotions.  Accompanied by out-of-tune guitars and stumbling drums, Jenkins sings, ""I know that
    you are through with me/ I know that you want to get rid of me/ I know that you have a plan for me/ I know
    that you want to torture me.""</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, other tracks, such as ""The Visitor"" and ""A Cry for Love"", indeed don't stray far from the Procession's
    heavy musical past. But then there's the airy Americana of ""Why I Stay"", the head-bobbing rock of ""Did You Wonder"",
    and the keyboard-driven ""Sympathy Crime"", with its touches of 70s prog, which seems to detail the narrator's
    murder of his former lover. As possible evidence, the next tracks offers: ""You bleed, you blister in the sun/
    You bleed for everyone."" (There's also a drawing of a slain woman in the album art.)  Yet, in the end, the
    narrator reveals that he is actually the ""one who has disappeared.""</p><p>
    
    Happy times, to be sure. But who would ever buy an album by a band called the Black Heart Procession and
    expect happiness, anyway?  With this record, the band has taken a risky, ambitious leap forward, ditching

    Personally, I'm damn fascinated with this new wave of Scandinavian garage-punk, seeing as the pale and
    friendly Swedes have always projected an image fairly lacking in angst and attitude.  But these days,
    thanks to The Hives, The Hellacopters, and Soundtrack of Our Lives, snow and skiing have bumped from
    my stereotype file on the northern European country and replaced with a mental picture of a place where
    <i>Nuggets</i> is assigned listening for schoolchildren and the poet laureate is Howard DeVoto.  Book me
    a flight to Stockholm!</p><p>
    Fortunately, I'm friends with an actual, genuine Swedish guy, granting me the journalistic edge on the
    kind of Sweden profiles that have been popping up everywhere lately.  So now, in a <i>Pitchførk Exklusiv</i>,
    I can disclose the true secret ingredient of the Swedish Invasion's allure.  Playing me a 1970s #1 Swedish
    hit with lyrics that pay tribute to the 1960s Beatles over music that sounds distinctly 1950s, my source
    sums it up succinctly, ""Swedish music has always been about twenty years behind the rest of the world.""
    And there it is, the reason why some might find The Hives more authentic throwbacks than American wayback
    White Strokes acts-- for Swedish musicians, the new wave really is still new, not the retro fad of Western
    culture.</p><p>
    Which brings us to the Sahara Hotnights, the next Swedish band with a turn of the 80s look/sound to jump
    from Stockholm to stardom.  Rocking a distinctly Joan Jett vibe, the all-girl foursome can't avoid the
    ""female Hives"" comparison, a typecasting made worse by frontlady Maria Andersson's relationship with Hives
    ringleader Pelle Almqvist.  Following the same reissue-of-old-import-material plan as their dates to the
    rock prom, <i>Jennie Bomb</i> finds the Hotnights hoping to avoid a sophomore slump for their homeland,
    thus proving that Sweden is more Manchester than Halifax.</p><p>
    Judging by the album, early signs are pretty good for the scene's longevity, if not entirely conclusive.
    While reports that Sahara Hotnights bring a harder sound than their countrymen have been greatly exaggerated,
    the band brings a comparably bratty attitude, albeit one that has had a good share of its rough edges
    polished off.  This approach occasionally leaves the Hotnights sounding more Pat Benatar than punk, with
    slick production undermining in-your-face middle-fingers like ""Alright Alright (Here's My Fist, Where's the
    Fight),"" but can't hide the rock band songwriting chops beneath.</p><p>
    Indeed, <i>Jennie Bomb</i> appears to be yet another shoe-in for radio rock airplay, with standard euphoric
    big-chorus format, chord progressions from the familiar-but-ear-pleasing school, shouty vocals (perfect for
    at-home replication) from all four band members.  ""With or Without Control"", the obvious heavy-rotation
    candidate of the bunch, even features the old pop song trick (last-chorus key-change) employed to exhaustion
    by the boy band throngs, but sounding pretty refreshing in this context.</p><p>
    Now, I'll be upfront about this: despite my groundbreaking Sweden time-capsule theory, Sahara Hotnights
    <i>occasionally</i> seem to be aware that the 90s happened, bringing to mind Sleater-Kinney influence when
    they're on (""Fall Into Line"", ""Down and Out"") and Veruca Salt infection when they're not (""Only the Fakes
    Survive"").  And naturally, Andersson doesn't possess the riveting vocal talents of a Corin Tucker, so when
    the hooks aren't sharp enough the Hotnights can't fall back on raw sass like those white-tie-wearing
    motherfuckers.  <i>Jennie Bomb</i> has also lost something in the translation from import release to
    domestic Jetset product: ""A Perfect Mess"" and ""Are You Happy Now?,"" two excellent songs mysteriously
    missing from the new reasonably-priced domestic version.</p><p>
    All the same, it's about time a group brought some feminine influence to this garage revival game, as Meg
    White's learn-as-you-go drumming didn't provide nearly enough estrogen.  And it's even more gratifying to
    see it coming from Sweden, the women of which having long been unfortunately associated in the American
    cortex with the beer-company cheesecake bikini team.  Sahara Hotnights might not be the best all-girl rock
    act in the business, or the best export from their wintry homeland, but they certainly don't do anything to
    damage the hipness quotient of the yellow-and-blue.</p></div>"|6967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6967-jennie-bomb/|7.3|Rob Mitchum

    exchanged tipsy fragments of ""Auld Lang Syne"" on national television, Urbana-Champaign's closest brush with
    mainstream relevance terminated.  Hum, the band most of us remember for a single massive pop song called
    ""Stars"" in the summer of 1995, spent the last two years of their existence cloaked in critical obscurity.
    While it was as much a coup as a measure of revenge against the corporate rock establishment of the period,
    a time that saw flannel and lumber turned fashionable, Hum found themselves with little room to maneuver.
    After 1998's <i>Downward is Heavenward</i> resulted in no significant increase in the band's audience (it
    sold only 38,000 copies), RCA severed their relationship with the band.</p><p>
    
    Enter Centaur, a band composed of former Hum vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Matt Talbott, drummer Jim Kelly
    (Sixteen Tons), and bassist Derek Niedringhaus (National Skyline).  As a veritable who's who of the Illinois
    metro area rock scene, Centaur began performing and writing in earnest before Hum officially dissolved.  For
    all practical purposes, Hum came to an end after a bus accident in Canada (a fitting anti-climax) in 1999
    but played two reunion shows on December 29th and 31st of 2000.   With a steady live presence, Centaur began
    gaining momentum.  Talbott also found the experience liberating as working within a three-piece structure
    helped weaken the opinion of Centaur as Hum, Jr.</p><p>
    
    What Hum lacked in subtlety, producer Keith Cleversley (Flaming Lips, Hum, Spiritualized, The Posies) has
    more than made up for here with a painstakingly delicate and nuanced production that puts the overwrought
    and sappy theatrics of Nigel Goodrich to shame.  Where Goodrich attempted to manufacture emotion through a
    bevy of glitzy studio fanfare on Beck's recent <i>Sea Change</i>, Cleversley manages to capture a tangible
    sense of pathos at roughly an eighth of the price.  Matt Talbott's talent as a songwriter has matured beyond
    the turgid spectacle that marked his earlier work.  Eschewing much of the sonic deluge for a simpler, more
    pronounced dynamic, primary emphasis is placed upon Talbott's ethereal and generally precarious vocals.</p><p>
    
    In the monstrous ""The Same Place"", a simple repetitive riff builds and repeatedly undermines itself in the
    best possible way, eventually culminating with a mind-blowing sonic assault that captures (and surpasses)
    anything Hum was capable of.  Steeped in textural density, we witness Talbott's favored technique of heaping
    layer upon layer of sound over an already sumptuous theme, but this time opting for a more tactful approach
    of understated melody.  In the final minute of ""The Same Place"", Centaur provides so many possible thematic
    directions that one has the sense the song could literally explode. Yet Talbott's taste is evident as the
    song disconnects itself and closes abruptly while dangling on the verge of chaos.</p><p>
    
    ""Placencia"" furthers Talbott's Brian Wilson fetish sans-studio theatrics through the use of gentle harmonies
    and distilled acoustics which provide the best example of Centaur's coherence.  Bearing more than a passing
    resemblance to <i>Pinkerton</i>-era Rivers Cuomo, the lazy surf feel is briefly sacrificed about three
    minutes in by a series of faux-metal guitar stabs, another example of Centaur's flirtation with discord,
    and ultimate respect for restraint.</p><p>
    
    ""Thimbles"" explores Talbott's own experience with tragedy, the death of his child and his concurrent sense
    of failure. ""Glimpse into forever and the empty aching arms and the breath that you could not make/ You
    still keep us awake,"" and, ""Ripples on the surface, drops in the sea/ We are nothing no matter how long
    we stay,"" echo disenchantment and alienation in a manner so rife with honesty that the song is almost too
    stark to bear.  Little interpretation is required to realize that the album's dedication-- and the only
    text printed on the inside of the CD case: ""For Henry... and his Mother"")-- accounts for the subject matter
    of ""Thimbles"", further adding to the depressive nature of the track by providing a very real connection to
    an otherwise isolated rock song.  As wave upon wave of subdued dissonance crash upon the sonorous drone of
    Talbott's vocals at the song's climax, the disparity provides an interesting counterpoint in the form of
    personal suffering opposite bleak, unflinching reality.</p><p>
<i>In Streams</i> stumbles in two places, namely the ill-advised Flaming Lips kitsch of ""Life Begins"", with
    Talbott's cracking voice rivaling Wayne Coyne at his most egregious, and the emo-core tedium of ""Strangers
    on 5"".  As a general rule, extended keyboard interludes are best avoided in a rock setting, and ""Strangers""
    is certainly no exception.  The album's title track also suffers from the same synth virus but to a lesser
    degree.  Although the Gary Numan synthline is a tad heavy-handed, ""In Streams"" is an epic track, clocking
    in at over thirteen minutes and fully encapsulating all of the sonic territory Centaur spent the previous
    45 minutes delineating.  Incorporating the alt-country sensibility of Wilco and the electronic-rock meld of
    Radiohead, the title track is an outright masterpiece.  And while a brilliant piece for 9:05, the four-minute
    synth outro is an example of what happens when talented songwriters suddenly decide to become Vangelis and
    should probably have been omitted.</p><p>
    
    Synthesized indulgences aside, Centaur have unleashed a wonderfully textured rock album.  The band has
    galvanized the experimentation of Hum in a cohesive package, and with a significantly more tactful hand.
    Ultimately, the true achievement of this album lies within the absence of major label politics.  Without
    pressures exerted by BMG Entertainment, RCA, or any other corporate demigod, Talbott was free to pursue
    precisely the sound he wanted at his own pace and with minimal expectations.  The result is a rewarding
    picture of sorrow and promise from one of the brightest and oft-overlooked songwriters of the past
    decade.</p></div>"|1374.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1374-in-streams/|8.4|Isaiah Violante

After all,
    the sketch is generally considered a mere preliminary, an outline for a greater piece to follow.  Personally,
    I'm not sure that dismissal is entirely justified.  Comedians jot down their own sketches, for instance, as
    a basic guide for the action to come.  The final result depends on the comic, and the best improvisers bring
    a scene to life in ways that might not have been envisioned on paper.  In general terms, the minimal outline
    of the sketch has its own appeal: the interpreter gets to flesh out the details.</p><p>
    Mus bring us their latest sketches by way of Xixón, Spain, rendered in the Asturian dialect sung by Mónica
    Vacas.  As a romance language, it's close enough to Spanish that you may easily translate certain words while
    others remain mysterious, just on the edge of recognition.  Vacas, along with bandmate Fran Gayo, has crafted
    a fine second album, though not without the help of guests Iván Palacios on bass, Luigi Navarro on guitar,
    and Frank Rudöw on drums.  The band has turned away here from the pastoral psychedelia of <i>Aida</i>, their
    contribution to Darla's ""Bliss Out"" series.  Though drenched in deep, midnight blue reverb, <i>El Naval</i>'s
    sparse arrangements take a more realist approach.</p><p>
    Roughly half of <i>El Naval</i> consists of near-acoustic piano ballads, while the other half is upbeat and
    electrified.  The latter songs form the heart of the album. ""Embalses y Ríos"" burns with a vibrant, melancholy
    bassline reminiscent of The Cure's ""A Night Like This.""  Vacas reworks lyrics from <i>Aida</i>, issuing them
    in her soft, direct style as chimes tingle and a piano breakdown cues the midsection.  Later, the jangling
    guitar introduction of ""Cuesta"" presages an angry, shambling groove, and the ramshackle drums sound all the
    more startling after the silence.  Afterwards, ""Casi Ensin Zarrar los Gueyos"" drifts outward on a bed of
    synthesizer delay akin to Pink Floyd.</p><p>
    The quieter compositions are less remarkable.  ""Al Debalu"" begins the album nicely with warm guitars and
    the steady tick-tock of its percussion, and Vacas's vocals lower to an enticing whisper.  But ""Al Oeste de
    la Divisoria"" allows for altogether too much intimacy, what with the heavy-handed piano form and, more
    notably, her sniffling intake of breath after every line.  I think of it as the ""caught a cold"" song, and
    strangely enough, it conveys that atmosphere aptly.  ""Sacramento"" fares better, with its backwards trails
    of acoustic guitar spun by guest Irene Tremblay of Aroah.  Still, these slow, predictable etches rarely
    diverge in tangent.  By the time ""Rencor"" is reached, the simplified music box jingle sounds like an
    unnecessary ode to Danny Elfman's <i>Edward Scissorhands</i> score.</p><p>
    Which is not to say that Mus lack surprises.  The interlude ""Casería"" uses the production's depth to its
    advantage, forming an organic glitch pastiche from the echoes of what sounds like a slammed door.  Personally,
    I love the thick reverb on this album, but it's hard to deny the suggestion that overproduction often
    attempts to hide a lack of ideas.  Though Vacas's and Gayo's reliance on the resonance of their instruments
    and the simple emotive framework of their plaintive rhythms is enough to get them by here, one wishes for
    some of the progressive songwriting the duo demonstrated on their ""Bliss Out"" volume.</p></div>"|5516.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5516-el-naval/|7.3|Christopher Dare

    elitist screed about the dangers of selling out-- just as you may be doing right now.  So let me be upfront:
    I'm happy for the guy.  I don't have any personal issues with him, nor do I think he's committed any brazen
    acts of treason toward the music community at large.</p><p>
    
    Adams has been grooming himself for rock star status
    for a very long time, without an ounce of subtlety.  In fact, he was qualified from the very beginning,
    when his band Whiskeytown signed with DGC subsidiary Outpost Recordings.  If anything, he's overqualified
    now: he's prolific, talented, and cocksure, and he's got the kind of apple-cheeked, midwestern good looks
    (and jean-jacket) that suggest rural summer nights spent listening to ""Pink Houses"".  Even before Winona,
    Alanis, Elton John duets, Gap commercials, MTV specials, and the incredibly fortuitous and profitable coup
    of releasing <i>Gold</i>, with its flag-bedecked cover art and single ""New York"" mere weeks after 9/11, he
    was as good as in.</p><p>
<i>Gold</i>, though, was a disappointment to many longtime fans, not because he was suddenly the very
    definition of mainstream success but because it simply couldn't hold a candle to its predecessor, 2000's
    stunning <i>Heartbreaker</i>.  And yet, as uneven, flawed, and possibly symptomatic of megalomania as
    <i>Gold</i> may have been, it increased Adams' celebrity tenfold.  No longer consigned to Sunday morning
    fodder for sentimental hipsters, alt-country purists, and aging public radio DJs hunting for latest
    reincarnation of Gram Parsons, Adams became so very famous that both of my parents now own at least one
    of his albums-- and that, ladies and gentlemen, is saying quite a lot.</p><p>
    
    I once offered up the observation that Ryan Adams would be capable of churning out some of the most solid,
    affecting music around were he contained in a room and limited to a four-track and the fewest possible
    instruments. <i>Demolition</i> should, by all rights, be that project. Demos hold the promise of the
    understated songs I've always wanted to believe Adams left off his bombastic, overwrought last offering.
    Given what it is, though, <i>Demolition</i> is awfully slick.  And while not, in theory, a follow-up to
    <i>Gold</i>, it's clear from the record's first track, ""Nuclear"", a radio-friendly hybrid of New Nashville
    and jangly college pop, that Adams intends for this record to be more than just a modest, for-the-fans
    compilation.</p><p>
    
    The swaggering, AM-dial rock 'n' roll of <i>Gold</i> is recalled in ""Gimme a Sign"", a wide-open space-rocker
    carried off with satisfactorily crunchy guitar that gets bonus points for the Byrdsian flourishes of
    Rickenbacker in the choruses.  But ""The Pink Hearts"", recorded with Adams' touring band, falters, and
    despite its roughhewn affectations, sounds mysteriously clean for a purported demo.  The ballads, thankfully,
    fare a bit better.  The Nick Drake-flavored ""You Will Always Be the Same"" features sparse accompaniment from an
    acoustic guitar, cello, and light percussion.  Lyrically, it's pretty straightforward, and it's also one of
    the few tracks here on which Adams is content to be himself, rather than imitating his influences.  Likewise,
    the near-elegiac ""Tomorrow"" features one of most subtle and perfect harmonies I've heard recently, and
    despite its faulty sequencing (it really ought to have been the closer), it's by far the album's best song.</p><p>
    
    Of course, while <i>Demolition</i> forgoes the overproduction and even much of the shameless rock-god
    posturing that plagued <i>Gold</i>, Adams hasn't yet found his way out of his songwriting rut.  This,
    perhaps, could be attributed to the nature of the record, since artists tend to save their best material
    for their official releases.  But both the harmonica-driven ""Hallelujah"" and the highly polished ""Cry on
    Demand"", sound strikingly like many of the misfires that haunted <i>Gold</i>.  Elsewhere, the pickin' n'
    grinnin' ""Chin Up, Cheer Up"" is a none-too-subtle rehash of <i>Heartbreaker</i>'s ""Winding Wheel"".  Such
    is the cost of prolificacy-- you can only write so many songs before they all begin to sound alike.</p><p>
    
    Now, Ryan Adams is no stranger to wearing his influences on his sleeve, and it seems like the harder rocking
    tracks on <i>Demolition</i> want to suggest a punker spirit, despite that, for the most part, it sounds as
    if he's traded in his Replacements LPs for John Cougar Mellencamp.  Still, it's possible that Adams may
    overcome the somewhat pandering nature of his last two albums to release his best work to date, provided he
    can rediscover his muse and find a producer that better suits his music.  Talent, after all, doesn't just
    evaporate.  And despite all my bitterness at having to stare at Adams' smug, airbrushed glare every time
    I drive past The Gap on Franklin Street, I like to think he might end up being more than just the guy who
    used to write good songs.</p></div>"|39.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/39-demolition/|5.5|Alison Fields

In existence since '95, the band has
    already released four albums, and divides their time between a wealth of
    side projects: singer/guitarist Adam Forkner makes music with drone-rock
    surrealists Surface of Eceon; drummer Jason Anderson leads Wolf Colonel;
    keyboardist Alex Bundy releases solo material as Planetarium Music.  Their
    last album, 2000's <i>Auspicious Winds</i>, was released too late in the
    year to make most peoples' year-end lists, but was, in itself, an incredibly
    powerful bliss-out session that echoed Spiritualized circa <i>Lazer Guided
    Melodies</i> not just in sound and scope, but in that its spacy, intertwining
    jams would, after several ethereal minutes, eventually arrive at beautifully
    ebbing-- and strikingly catchy-- pop songs.</p><p>
    
    Bubbling under their newest release, <i>The Golden Vessyl of Sound</i>, is
    an entrenched band mythology involving moth people, interplanetary craft,
    and the Small Towers of the Elders.  There's a story unfolding here.  The
    narrative, however, is not germane to the enjoyment of the record.  As you
    listen to these nine tracks, which drift from classic shoegaze textures to
    late-60s psychedelia (with an extended stopover in the cavernous tank where
    Pauline Oliveros and Stuart Dempster practice Deep Listening), your mind will
    wander, and you'll come up with images of your own.</p><p>
    
    Their press release indicates that these songs were built out of improvisations
    and were not titled out of respect for the sanctity of the ""the moment"".  As
    such, Yume Bitsu would prefer I refer to the sound that appears when I hit play
    and then press my CD player's ""forward button"" twice as ""Song Three"", but I'd
    like to title this gorgeous snippet ""We'll Be Together"". These are the words
    Forkner harmonizes with himself, sounding something like Doug Martsch after a
    really good night's sleep.  It's such a simple song, with the chiming Galaxie
    500-esque guitars swaying between two chords and the aching purity of the
    layered vocal. And at two minutes, it's also sadistically short, a rare dip
    into brevity on an album filled with expansive jams.</p><p>
    
    While Forkner's vocals make only occasional appearances on <i>The Golden Vessyl
    of Sound</i>, they're a large part of what makes it so special.  Our ears have
    long since grown accustomed to jammy, neo-shoegaze bands burying monotone
    warbling between sheets of guitar feedback (""It's just another instrument,"" they
    like to say). So it's pleasantly disorienting to hear singing this careful and
    audible on an album packed with interstellar explorations. Hell, the harmonies
    on ""Song Seven"", a soaring track filled with moth-people imagery and punctuated
    by snare and handclaps, sound as tightly assembled as anything off 1970s AM
    radio.  Still, the fact that the album is about 90% instrumental seems just
    right in the end, increasing the emotional impact of the vocals exponentially.</p><p>
    
    Of course, as with any band with two guitarists that specializes in long, slowly
    developing jams, the six-string is the centerpiece, and Yume Bitsu's guitarists
    extract a fantastic amount of sound from theirs. The echoing, fuzz-encircled tone
    that accompanies the extended freakout of ""Song One"" deserves to bounce around a
    canyon somewhere. Combined with a primal ""eeee-yahhhh"" from Forkner and some
    layered trumpets, the track turns into the aural equivalent of a sunrise in Sedona.</p><p>
    
    ""Song Six"" switches out a controlled feedback drone for the lead-line fuzztone,
    the guitars harmonizing with extended trombone drones (this fine track owes a lot
    to Oliveros).  Elsewhere, the punchy closer, ""Song Nine"", mixes IDM-style drum
    programming with intertwined guitars and synths, and Bundy gets his moment with
    ""Song Four"", which backgrounds the guitars for his Tangerine Dream sequencers,
    lending an early 70s Rhineland feel.</p><p>
    
    Though it has its share of dark shadings (particularly the drones of ""Song Six""),
    <i>The Golden Vessyl of Sound</i> glows with positivity, just as its title would
    indicate. Yume Bitsu is the sound of four men in love with sound who know how to
    channel their collective energy. Myths and backstory be damned, this is one of
    the best psychedelic albums of the year.</p></div>"|8836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8836-the-golden-vessyl-of-sound/|8.5|Mark Richardson

    at some point references his work; judging by his recent live performances of Whitehouse-like noise, the
    only person who doesn't want to be James is James himself.  And I have serious doubts that Astrobotnia is.</p><p>
    
    The two CD releases are true to the Rephlex school of sound design: geared for home-listening rather than
    club use, and riddled with fearsome drum machine programming and gleaming ambient chords which surf the crests
    of adapted jungle rhythms.  Though Astrobotnia, wisely, shows delicacy with the opener to <i>Part One</i>,
    ""Lightworks"". Emerging from the far distance, echoed crackles and faint explosions of fireworks provoke
    giggles from children.  Astrobotnia deftly morphs these firework sounds into a fragile but complex series
    of beats, which he binds together with a shimmering belt.  It's quite the most gorgeous opening track I've
    heard all year. ""Hallo"" spends three-quarters of its length pitting breaks against beatlessness until
    Astrobotnia relents and allows the beatless to shimmer towards the final fade.</p><p>
    
    By contrast, ""Everyone"" is a nagging chant (""I want to kill everyone/ Satan is good/ Satan is our pal""),
    borrowing the comic-demonic from Aphex's ""Come to Daddy"" and combining it with the goofball lechery of
    ""Milkman"". ""Acidophilus"" demonstrates how mysterious the classic 303 acid squiggle can be when hemmed
    within a drifting chords.  Later, ""Miss June"", ""Sweden"", and ""The Wing Thing"" bring home a DMX Krew/Aphex
    fusion of choice electro cuts.</p><p>
    
    Released on a twelve-inch, the six untitled tracks that comprise <i>Part Two</i> are primed and cut for
    clubs, recalling the intoxicating pounding excesses of Squarepusher's <i>Big Loada</i>. ""Track One"" is a
    Metalheadz rinse-out made galactic by Namlook-like ambient waves. ""Track Three"" is a Stockhausen-style
    noise collage that sounds remixed by <i>Newbuild</i>-era 808 State. ""Track Four"" samples the same snippet
    of Lyn Collins' ""Think"" that DJ Rob Base &amp; DJ EZ Rock snagged for their classic ""It Takes Two"" phased,
    flanged, and timestretched with caustic rips and ambient nastiness.  And the final track recapitulates much
    of the previous five, but adds a humorously dated future-sound with Astrobotnia's widespread use of
    retro-spacy BBC Radiophonic Workshop vibes.</p><p>
<i>Part Three</i> returns to the expansive headspace of <i>Part One</i>, albeit with a more malevolent
    undertow.  Here, the elements that make <i>Part One</i> so lush and celebratory are curiously corrupted.
    ""B"" bears the same Metalheadz rhythms as ""Track One"" of <i>Part Two</i> but underpins them with searing
    blasts of distortion and clangs of spacejunk. ""Acidophilus II"" is the abrasive sibling to the ""Acidphilus""
    of <i>Part One</i>; its 303 squiggle is downright menacing. ""Esther Calling Jennifer"" is even more disturbing:
    a chthonic growling reigns unchallenged until Astrobotnia releases ninja rhythms which make their stealthy
    ways to windswept targets.</p><p>
    
    Though none of these releases breaks new ground, they are unmistakably nostalgic and exactly what I've
    hoped Aphex might return to. They all hark back to a time when jungle's breakbeats saved IDM from
    disappearing into an exitless series of ever-decreasing circles. Breakbeats liberated producers from the
    impositions of relentless four-to-the-floor stomping, and ""braindance"" escaped the mind/body binary
    opposition of electronic music-- here was a rhythmically hyper, complex genre that retained its club roots
    by appending fantastically supple limbs to the listener's fervid imagination.  And Astrobotnia, whoever he
    or she is, sumptuously celebrates that music.</p></div>"|327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/327-parts-1-2-3/|8.2|Paul Cooper

Or at least that's what I like to tell myself,
    if only because that makes it easier to believe it's just a fluke when
    talent falls on its face.  I mean, god forbid my heroes and idols should
    just happen to tank; I mean, it's not a given that musicians lose their
    edge along with their hair... is it?.  I find it sunnier to convince
    myself that these tankings are isolated incidents-- at least, until the
    washed-up begin to accrete, forming Farm Aid-sized clots in the arteries
    of the entertainment industry.  Then I start to worry.</p><p>
    
    Listening to Eyes Adrift is like watching the fat Orson Welles play the
    fat Elvis (in a Quentin Tarantino film)-- which is to say, worrying.
    Technically, this band might as well be called the Meat Puppets, as
    frontman Curt Kirkwood used the name for his last album even after
    parting ways with the Pups of old (Derrick Bostrom and Kirkwood's brother
    Cris).  Maybe he thought the name change would revitalize his sound, which,
    after the Puppets's fantastic run of albums in the 80s, had veered sharply
    into a sort of ZZ Top-country arena before becoming stuck in a bog of
    general alternativity.</p><p>
    
    But Kirkwood didn't just change the name-- that alone surely couldn't improve
    the music... but a change in lineup?  Now we're talking.  Apparently, while
    Curt was on his first solo tour, Nirvana's Krist Novoselic and Sublime's Bud
    Gaugh both called him, out of the blue, intent on a quick jam before he left
    town.  The rest, as history, doesn't need to be repeated.</p><p>
    
    As members of mythical bands whose legends were cut short, you might imagine
    these two would have some kind of spark left to contribute.  Unfortunately,
    as sidemen who both lost charismatic frontmen, they also tend to fall right
    in line behind Curt.  When Nirvana, in their most magnanimous act of indie
    community service, brought the Kirkwood brothers on stage and covered three
    songs from <i>Meat Puppets II</i> for their ""Unplugged"" session, it sounded
    living, vital, and appropriate, with each group's distinct brand of nihilism
    rubbing up against the others.</p><p>
    
    Here, however, the great potential of Novoselic's
    menacing basswork gets summarily steamrolled by the overall cleanliness of the
    proceedings, and he takes a distant backseat to Kirkwood's guitar.  Even his
    surprise turns on vocals, which come off as goofy but just raw enough to have
    a shot at working, can't survive in an atmosphere tailored to Kirkwood's adopted
    two-dimensional singing style.  And, while a reggae experiment would probably
    have been ill-advised (as they usually are), the band's adherence to pop/rock
    rhythms doesn't give Gaugh a chance to shine, either.  Even on the obligatory
    15-minute closing jam, ""Pasted"", Kirkwood's guitar grabs the spotlight and
    refuses to let go.</p><p>
    
    Some of these songs, like <i>Pasted</i>, fail in fairly conventional, generic
    ways.  The opener, ""Sleight of Hand"", is as thin as its title suggests, doing
    little more than establishing a shimmery lounge-jazz atmosphere.  ""Telescopes""
    goes to the other extreme, replicating the Pups's recent forays into benign
    metal with glibly surreal lyrics.  Elsewhere, some initially promising songs
    are roughly strangled to death in their first minute; ""Alaska"" starts with a
    standard but pretty Kirkwood guitar arpeggio before mercilessly bludgeoning it
    with a power-chord chorus.  Novoselic gives a gutsy vocal performance on the
    odd rockabilly number ""Dottie Dawn and Julie Jewel"", but Kirkwood, as on most
    of the rest of the record, can't think of anything better to do with the song
    than to add an effected guitar solo, this time sounding like Charlie Sexton in
    a wind tunnel.</p><p>
    
    The album's most likeable songs are its least adventurous ones; ""Untried"" has a
    pretty chorus melody echoed by a fluid guitar line, and ""Pyramids"" has a mellow
    sort of yearning to it.  But most of this stuff is middling at best, and while
    it could be explained away by poor production or lack of effort, it doesn't take
    much to tip the scale in the other direction.</p><p>
    
    Enter ""Inquiring Minds"", a song that is, from start to finish, one giant convulsive
    cringe.  Over a feathery guitar intro, Novoselic falsettos, ""They put flowers on
    your grave, JonBenet,"" and the song crashes head-on into a wretched ballad about
    the murdered celebrity child.  It's not just the lyrical obsession with exhuming
    the girl's body that makes this so awful; it's the fact that the song isn't really
    sure whether or not it's a tasteless parody.  At times, the band seems to
    (understandably) offer sympathy to Ms Ramsey-- in the form of a kind line (""You can
    never ask them"") or one of Kirkwood's prolific, dripping-with-sincerity solos--
    only to snatch it right back with a sneer from Novoselic.</p><p>
    
    In ""Solid"", which sounds like an ode to lost inspiration, Kirkwood sings, ""What I
    am's a plastic man.../ I could cut myself and nothing would come out/ 'Cause the
    blood is frozen solid in my veins.""  After a few listens, you begin to realize that
    there's nothing in the uninspired plod of the song to contradict him.  Ultimately,
    Curt may be expressing some sort of universal truth about fame, talent, and insatiable
    expectations here.  But did he really have to get together with a bunch of his
    similarly disillusioned friends to tell it (and destroy my illusions in the process)?
    Inquiring minds want to know.</p></div>"|2887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2887-eyes-adrift/|4.3|Brendan Reid

It is everything you could conjure, juvenile and immediate,
    like the overblown store-bought psychedelia of Pink Floyd: mall and science museum culture.  Like a
    proudly brandished tie-dyed t-shirt, Black Dice dances and hums its way from a Phish concert crowd
    straight to the Knitting Factory by avoiding the funk, amping the jams, and turning up the volume.</p><p>
    
    Black Dice's <em>Beaches and Canyons</em> is full of spaced-out planetarium moments, drenched in
    high-pitched squeals and thunderous low end.  ""Seabird"" is a tone poem: the repeated sound/image
    of flight and wings is warped until only creaks remain.  Repetitive knob-turning seems to conjure
    animals who appear to be fighting.  The frogs always win.</p><p>
    
    The album generally tends to eschew pounding hardcore rhythms, employing beats in unique and clever
    ways throughout the compositions to keep them vital.  The drums are very effective throughout in their
    ability to add presence to the ongoing loops, adding a pounding heart to the web of tortured sounds
    and affected melodies. While the violence seems to be almost entirely washed away from their previous
    efforts, the impressive aspect of this LP is its ability to translate the live show for which the Black
    Dice is primarily known into a private show-- an ideal recording. These songs seem more like juxtapositions,
    blueprints, instructions.</p><p>
    
    With <em>Beaches and Canyons</em>, Black Dice fully embrace the chanting, pounding and moaning of the
    Grateful Dead: lovin' the jam.  These songs, all of which I've heard played live in the past six or so
    months, are imminently changeable, fluid, and interesting.  The songs reveal themselves in subtle ways,
    hiding their identities for minutes at a time, then briefly reappearing as themselves throughout the song,
    as a slightly repeating pattern or token sound.  The songs go out of and back into themselves in a manner
    similar to John Coltrane's late-era renditions of ""My Favorite Things"": the crowd in Japan, stunned by an
    hour-long take on Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein, suddenly remember what they're enjoying when the theme returns as
    a slurred parade of squeaked notes.</p><p>
    
    ""The Dream is Going Down"" is Black Dice at its evocative best.  At the end, the song breaks down, like any
    good trip, into its most primal elements: Hisham pounds away on the drums, Aaron hums and half-sings through
    thick delay while Bjorn and Eric shriek and wail on guitar, voice, and effects. ""Big Drop"" points to Black
    Dice's most violent impulses, spreading seven or eight grindcore melodies over the course of nearly 17
    minutes.  It seems to be all beach here, too-- ebbing, flowing, and following the water.  The screams are
    balanced with falsetto moaning, which falls into itself, collapsing, canyoning, ending.</p><p>
    
    ""Endless Happiness"" is a
    mess of recorder sounds and chiming, ring-modulated guitar, as well as the heavy bass swells for which
    Aaron is known.  The percussion kicks in halfway through the track, and the recorder begins to sound
    Ayler-esque while the modulations and bass swells stay constant.  The loops reach a frantic pace before
    dying, leaving a bed of static dry air.  Air is overcome by water, and the end of the track is a thorough
    brain-cleaning, a nice and clear literal representation of the 'beaches' component.  The collage of water
    samples lasts for several minutes-- a lucid translation from thought into music of a serenity Black Dice
    rarely acheive.</p><p>
    
    Black Dice have managed to create an album that properly illustrates the changing nature of their sound.
    Many groups have found this extremely difficult to achieve on tape, often sticking to formulas in the
    studio while limiting their experiments to live shows. <em>Beaches and Canyons</em> is an intense document
    of Black Dice's evolution-- cycling through styles and equipment like they're simple and meaningless tools,
    eyes on the goal of reorganizing sound and transforming it through sheer volume.</p></div>"|748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/748-beaches-and-canyons/|8.5|Mike Bernstein

    the new noise-pop-- just ask They Might Be Giants.  Or Elephant 6, for that matter, who seem to be undergoing
    a gradual metamorphosis into Tin Pan Alley for Nickelodeon viewers, what with Bill Doss' Sunshine Fix concept
    album about the sun, Beulah's live cover of ""The Alphabet Song"", and Of Montreal's ongoing campaign to give
    the world's children horrific nightmares.  One almost begins to think that Jeff Mangum's return to the
    musical scene will be a sex education concept album called <i>Ovary &amp; The Semen-Stained Mountaintops</i>.</p><p>
    
    Now comes <i>Velocity of Sound</i> by The Apples in Stereo, an album that confirms that the Colorado-based
    quintet has now made the full transistion to animated status.  I'll admit that this impression is more than
    a little informed by the band's <i>Roger Rabbit</i>-inspired video for ""Let's Go"", a short promotional piece
    run constantly as space-filler on the Cartoon Network.  But since Schneider &amp; Co achieved more success than ever
    thanks to that song's inclusion on the ""Powerpuff Girls""' curiously indie-friendly souvenir LP, it's no
    surprise to find the band milking the preferences of their newly acquired audience.</p><p>
    
    Of course, said audience's median age is about nine years old, meaning the band's approach might have to be
    stripped down somewhat to tickle the pre-teen ear.  Which is what we hear.  All of the standard Apples in
    Stereo elements have been greatly exaggerated on this outing: the tempo is uniformly set at a brisk gallop,
    the runtimes are shorter than ever, the guitars are more fuzzed-out and trebly, and the vocals are accelerated
    to make Schneider sound girlish-- and to make <i>actual</i> girl Hilarie Sidney squeaky like a chipmunk or elf
    or chipmunk/elf hybrid.  And though the Apples have always been strongly confectionary, <i>Velocity of
    Sound</i> ramps up the sugar content to equal a year's worth of impulse binges at FAO Schweetz.</p><p>
    
    But if you've got a sweet tooth, <i>Velocity of Sound</i> does provide a few irresistible vending machine
    snacks.  Take ""Baroque"", which transforms the usual ""ba ba ba"" backing vocals into a neat Bach-inspired
    three-part arpeggio, and ""Rainfall"" is the first Hilarie-sung song not to be buried and forgotten in the
    middle of an Apples album-- rightfully so, too, as its amphetamine country drumbeat and Pixies-esque lead
    guitar are a sunny afternoon good time for any age.</p><p>
    
    Too bad the striving for simplicity also holds back the band's efforts.  Thematically, The Apples keep their
    songs at a sub-G-rating level, which has the potential to grate on a listener with tastes that extend beyond
    Raffi.  Take the deep thoughts of ""Something"", for instance (""Something/ I want something""), or the
    hang-out-with-the-uncool-kids message of ""That's Something I Do"", which could easily serve as a companion
    piece to Avril Lavigne's ""Sk8tr Boi"".  Musically, hyperactive songs like ""Please"" and ""Mystery"" blur into
    each other before too long, while influences-on-their-sleeve tracks like ""She's Telling Lies"" (which doesn't
    so much rip off one single Beach Boys song as it does the entire Beach Boys catalog) come off as too
    derivative.</p><p>
    
    On an album that feels about six minutes long (it's actually just under 29), a couple highlights aren't
    enough to make it a keeper.  But you can't necessarily count the band's new younger focus as a flaw;
    <i>Velocity of Sound</i> showcases a tight, concentrated power-pop sound that the band seemed to have lost
    on their last couple outings.  While it might not endure for any listener that's completed the warzone that
    is puberty, it'd still be a pretty solid indie-cred stocking-stuffer for the training-wheels set come
    Christmas time.  Only 87 more shopping days!</p></div>"|250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/250-velocity-of-sound/|6.4|Rob Mitchum

Dating
    back at least to musique concrète, artists have been pulling sounds from one
    setting and sticking them into another, radically transforming the content
    of the source material. More recently, artists like Ultra Red, Terre
    Thaemlitz and Matthew Herbert have taken sounds and shaped them to comment
    on immigration (Ultra Red's <i>La Economia Nueva</i>) identity politics
    (Thaemlitz' <i>Interstices</i>) and corporate globalism (Herbert's record as
    Radioboy, <i>The Mechanics of Destruction</i>), among other hot topics.  But
    as Montreal's Tim Hecker demonstrates, not all recontextualization need be so
    political.</p><p>
    The emerging Hecker joins the culture jammers with this 25-minute EP, his
    second release under his own name. As the cover art and title make clear,
    <i>My Love is Rotten to the Core</i> is built from the processed sounds of
    Van Halen. Excerpts from a David Lee Roth interview open the record, and the
    first track, ""Introducing Carl Cocks"", is peppered with Kid-606-style cut-ups
    of Eddie's lead on ""Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love,"" while a series of familiar ""Hey
    hey hey!"" shouts appear at key points. No question, it's a fantastic,
    mind-warping track.</p><p>
    As the record wears on, musical sources become harder to place and noise
    becomes more prominent. ""Sammy Loves Eddie Hates David"" contains more dialog
    and some creepily processed onstage banner by Roth, and then ""Hello Detroit""
    dives into swirling digital scree. The minute-long ""Midnight Whispers"" is
    nothing but interview chatter fading into ""The Return of Sam Snead"", which
    adds several layers of voices and sets them against a quivering sound that
    could be a time-stretched guitar or might be a late-period Eddie synth. The
    lead tone on ""The Return of Sam Snead"" eventually shatters into smaller
    pieces, some of which spin off into little loops of their own.</p><p>
<i>My Love is Rotten to the Core</i> is a decent record with at least one
    great moment, but I can't help but wonder: what made Tim Hecker want to build
    an EP around the sights and sounds of Van Halen? Printed on the inside sleeve
    is the line, ""You have nothing to lose but your hair,"" so it seems reasonable
    to conclude that Hecker is making fun of the band and/or Roth. But the music
    contains almost no humor at all (the shredding of the guitar might bring a
    smile, but more one of recognition), and how fun could putting down Diamond
    Dave possibly be in any case?</p><p>
    Ultimately, the relationship between the sources and the final tracks on <i>My
    Love is Rotten to the Core</i> is uncertain, a problem when extrapolating from
    such a recognizable pop culture icon. ""Introducing Carl Cocks"" is the only
    truly exceptional track-- I love the way Hecker twists Eddie's lead, retaining
    enough of the familiar tone to jog the memory only to seriously disorient it.
    It's such a strong track it almost makes the EP, but then the rest is merely
    pretty good abstract laptop music that happens to be made from guitar solos,
    with a few interviews thrown in. Most of it could be from anywhere, though, and
    I can't help wishing it were presented differently.</p></div>"|3797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3797-my-love-is-rotten-to-the-core/|6.8|Mark Richardson

    endless.  The results are also almost always a lot more interesting than
    this.  Apparently, Dan Littleton, the Alpha Male of the indie folk group
    Ida, and Tara Jane O'Neil, ex-fill-in-the-blank (Rodan, the Sonora Pine,
    Retsin), felt that, after touring extensively together with their own
    respective songs, they should take that big next step and become
    more-than-tourmates.  So they made an album together.  Sure, they knew
    it would be awkward at times, and that their friends might think they
    were weird, but you know what?  You can't blame the kids for trying.
    Every time they sat down before that four-track, they must have gazed
    sweetly into each others' eyes, whispered ""no regrets"", and started
    banging morosely on their instruments.</p><p>
    
    Actually, despite song titles suggestive of upper-crust adolescent
    crushes (""Juliette"", ""The Langorous Girl"", ""Sweet Neck"") and the general
    mood of tentativeness that these instrumentals invoke, you get the sense
    that O'Neil and Littleton are pretty confident in what they're playing,
    that each string-pop and off-key note, however random-sounding, was
    intentional on some level.  That, however, is about the best thing they've
    got going for them here.  Perhaps it's that grim determinism that sinks
    this (and marks this) as an attempt at improvised music from two singer/songwriters.
    Almost every piece opens with one guitarist playing a very simple figure
    at a mournful tempo while the other pokes around on his or her fretboard,
    sometimes tonally, sometimes prettily, most times not.  And, well, they
    pretty much just go on like that.</p><p>
    
    Sometimes they substitute other instruments for the guitars (murky
    keyboards, a vibraphone, etc), but they're basically filling the same
    roles.  In time (unless, in the name of fragmentation, the pieces cut
    out suddenly in the middle, as many tend to do), O'Neil and Littleton
    introduce very subtle changes in the atmosphere, but ""time"" here means
    around six minutes, minimum.  The two give themselves an awful lot of
    space, temporally and sonically, but they rarely do anything meaningful
    with it.</p><p>
    
    Improvisation usually means that the unexpected can happen; here, things
    quickly become all too familiar.  Which is not to say that the static
    approach never works; ""The Disembodied Juliette"" manages to swell beautifully
    without ever really changing (aside from the entrance of a few well-placed,
    distorted vocals near the end), and the hints of electronic texture added
    to ""The Langorous Girl"" set it apart from the rest of the general sparseness.
    However, when O'Neil and Littleton had to do so little to get so much
    more out of these two pieces, it's a wonder they didn't do the same with
    the rest.</p><p>
    
    The oddball song, a gentle French-pop pastiche called ""Ooh La La..."", coaxes
    twee-as-hell vocals from both participants into a formlessly slight, sweet
    melody.  Now, I don't pretend to speak French, but I feel vaguely like I'm
    being cheated; lines like ""parfait Curvoisier de montage"" sound like they
    could just be meaningless collages of Franglish words.  Could I find deeper
    meaning if I dug into the song?  Is this just a bunch of crap O'Neil and
    Littleton pasted together?  Are they making little boy/girl twitters at me

These
    people work hard to create works that will somehow stand apart from the
    rest of the product delivered by other musicians, works that will somehow
    instantly connect with many people at once.  This phenomenon isn't unique
    to music, of course, but it does seem oddly, mundanely survivalist for a
    group of people who would be called ""artists"".  The daily ritual of
    distinguishing oneself-- while never remaining distinguished for so long
    that one is surpassed by the next wave-- spans entire species, and even
    the most insular musicians will march alongside normal folk to this tune.</p><p>
    However, despite this constant mutation of style, artists will occasionally
    emerge from their time as its representative.  Nature generally allows these
    instances to run a short course before devouring them into nothingness.  Think
    of those artists who overpowered the grind of their eras: Bach, Wagner, Miles
    Davis, The Beatles-- all of these people were consistently displaced of their
    time by the striking originality of their work, and yet were quintessentially
    ""then"".  This is rare, indeed, and there is a case for including Masami Akita
    in such a group.</p><p>
    Merzbow, as Masami is usually known, was born in 1956 in Japan.  He studied
    painting and art history in college, and worked as an editor and writer for
    experimental art publications after graduating.  From a very early point,
    Merzbow (named after the painting ""Merzbau"" by noted avant-garde artist
    Kurt Schwitters) was interested in 20th Century extremist concepts such as
    Surrealism and Art Brut (a principal wherein only personal impulse/delusion
    inform one's art, rather than external styles or works).  Furthermore, his
    interest and reportedly vast knowledge of bondage and pornography are common
    visual references accompanying his music.  His own releases number in the
    hundreds, and if any musical fabric binds them, it is that of total
    determination to assault listener senses.  I can't say he is self-indulgent
    any more than I can say he is deviant any more than I can say he is a genius
    any more than I can say he is not.  He is Merzbow, and if you have followed
    his journey for long, that means more than any other context.</p><p>
<i>A Taste of Merzbow</i> is his first solo release (second overall) for
    Austrian imprint Mego, and features many of the common elements of his work:
    tape loops, metallic percussion jabs, squealing feedback and drastic bursts
    of other unidentified noise.  It is also the latest in his recent line of
    computer-based music.  Don't let the label or his hard-drive fool you: this
    is still Merzbow at his overloaded best/worst, and despite the record's quaint
    Japanese cuisine theme (each piece is associated with a traditional dish,
    complete with recipe on individual CD inserts), is not the first place to go
    for anyone testing the waters of experimental electronic, musique concrète,
    or even noise music.</p><p>
    Mammoth workouts like ""Turban Shell Blues"" and ""Tempura in Moss Garden""
    attest to Merzbow's singular visions of radical overkill and pleasure
    through pain.  The latter features layers upon layers of howling
    static-thunder and what sounds like the distorted shattering of glass, all
    over the insistent pulse of an electronic bass drum.  After 10 minutes, it
    is headache inducing; at 22 minutes it is either life-affirming or
    suicide-coercing.  Contradiction plays no less a part in the former track,
    wherein the opening percussion loop hints at a hidden structure at work,
    only to explode into a furious void of feedback, blacksmith hammering and
    omnipresent static.</p><p>
    Despite sonic evidence to the contrary, Merzbow does have roots.  He has
    spoken of his early admiration for everyone from Jimi Hendrix to Iannis
    Xenakis, and elaborated at length on the meaning of his uses of bondage
    and porn images with some of his music.  On the one hand, he is merely the
    brightest fire in an eclectic, almost anarchic Japanese music scene.  On the
    other, Merzbow's music shatters scenes and precedents.  Masami Akita is his
    own context, and listeners enter that world at their own risk.</p></div>"|5247.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5247-a-taste-of-merzbow/|7.4|Dominique Leone

Like a Raymond Carver short story or a Carl Andre
    sculpture, the best hip-hop has utilized the simplest of aesthetics to portray the most complex emotional,
    political and cultural dynamics. No frills, gimmicks, or masturbatory embellishments; just simple loops,
    lyrics, and beats that somehow manage to convey the moral ambiguity and logical contradictions that comprise
    life. You don't need to be versed in Eliot and you don't have to understand Stravinsky. What you do need is
    the courage to spit the truth, the confidence to flow, and the basic street-level inventiveness to manipulate
    technology. In other words, you need to keep that shit real.</p><p>
    
    If this was Cambodia in the 1970s, the butchered bodies of Anticon emcees would line the streets. With <i>The
    No Music</i>, released on Anticon, Themselves has successfully mystified hip-hop to the point of almost
    complete obscurity.  It's a horribly pointless and boring album that will only satisfy those who equate
    progress with soulless beats and abstract mic theatrics. Only after years of frying their synapses on DMT
    and regrettable grad-school poetry, could one possibly understand why this is considered by some to be
    ""revolutionizing"" hip-hop.</p><p>
    
    When this record's beats aren't being shrouded in noise and butchered by effects, they're flimsy and
    disposable. Jel, who produces the albums, lays down drums that lack any visceral resonance and uses samples
    which, while often creative, are always utterly predictable. The song ""Poison Pit"" begins with a muffled
    dialogue and an elevating buzzing sound before launching into a dull beat in which a barely audible Dose
    One ""raps"" in a whiny voice: ""Where is the safe happy everlasting page-long candy coat?"" Another voice
    responds: ""Over there, draped over your black birthday black and exposed throat."" While passages such as
    this one may have a deep and resonating meaning to Anticon fans, to the rest of us, it sounds like
    pretentious nonsense that would play out a lot better on paper than on the tape. Perhaps Dose One would
    benefit from being reminded that hip-hop is derived from the spoken word traditions of the Last Poets and
    not the modernist obscurity of Ezra Pound or H. Doolittle.</p><p>
    
    Another even more baffling excursion down the rabbit hole of ponderous pretense is the next track, ""Live
    Trap"". Over a doubled-up, pseudo-jungle beat, Dose One raps faster than anyone could possibly understand.
    He may be conveying the secrets of the world (although I seriously doubt that), but in his under-enunciated
    sing-song flow, all power is lost.</p><p>
    
    I don't think anyone's trying to constrict hip-hop from continuing to evolve with the times. But when
    something is as purposefully obscure as <i>The No Music</i> you have to wonder whether it qualifies as
    being revolutionary or merely self-indulgent. Although not quite as often as on previous releases, there
    are some passages on <i>The No Music</i> where Dose One manages to string along some particularly evocative
    imagery. But for the most part, the beauty is lost in the sonic flatulence of self-important experimentation.</p></div>"|7986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7986-the-no-music/|4.5|Sam Chennault

    Britney Spears or Linkin Park-- and not for reasons of fame or money.  Spears and Linkin Park, after all,
    make decidedly contemporary music that, while tangentially owing debt to earlier music periods, puts little
    pressure on them to legitimize their backgrounds. Spears was once a teen who liked Madonna; Linkin Park were
    once teens who liked angst. That's about all anyone asks of them.</p><p>
    
    Not so for Sam ""Jim"" Beam. He makes bare-bones music that constantly nods to musical periods long since
    passed, perhaps the earliest being the 1920s of Blind Lemon Jefferson. In short, Beam makes roots music
    with southern themes, though to end there would do him a disservice. But now knowing this, you may be
    wondering: What are his qualifications?  Is this guy authentic?</p><p>
    
    Where you come from, of course, can automatically grant you authenticity. Perhaps the best current example
    of this is Detroit; if The White Stripes and Eminem grew up in the most miserable city in the States, they
    <i>must</i> be for real!  Beam, however, hails from the Miami area, which is not exactly backwoods
    Mississippi. Moreover, he teaches cinematography at a local college (an academic!) and was recently signed
    to Sub Pop, of all labels.</p><p>
    
    Of course, issues of authenticity plagued Bob Dylan at first. Plus, isn't Neil Young a Canadian? In other
    words, if you exhibit enough talent, then the critics will look past whatever your background may be, and
    time-- the greatest critic of all-- will erase any petty misgivings. While Beam has a long way to go before
    joining these visionaries, <i>The Creek Drank the Cradle</i> is a good enough start to make you forget
    anything you ever knew about the man. The music speaks for itself, and for Beam's talent.</p><p>
    
    The gentle acoustic plucking that ushers in the opener, ""Lion's Mane"", may not grab your attention, but
    Beam's delicate, hushed vocals sure will. His lyrics, meanwhile, tread familiar territory without sounding
    <i>too</i> familiar. He even tackles love through metaphor without seeming like a high school poet: ""Love
    is a tired symphony you hum when you're awake/ Love is a crying baby mama warned you not to shake.""</p><p>
    
    As with the rest of the album, slide guitar and banjo appear throughout the first track. The folksy sound
    sometimes recalls Nick Drake-- that is, if the British troubadour were from the bayou instead. In the
    lolling ""Bird Stealing Bread"", Beam's voice then takes on a Drake-ian resemblance, as he sings, ""Did his
    hand in your hair feel a lot like a thing you believed in?/ Or a bit like a bird stealing bread out from
    under your nose?""</p><p>
    
    By the time ""Faded from the Winter"" arrives, the album has its hooks in you. Beam's overdubbed harmonies,
    delivered in a repetitive cadence, are spooky without being forbidding, bringing Low's early work to mind,
    if only in pace and tone. On songs like this one, Beam feels like an artist working in different hues of
    the same color-- blue, perhaps, or brown.</p><p>
    
    But the changes keep coming, subtle though they are. ""The Rooster Moans"", with its layered banjos and talk
    of riding a rusty train to the Devil, could sit firmly in the middle of the <i>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>
    soundtrack and no one would blink an eye. The southern themes continue on ""Upward Over the Mountain"", in
    which the narrator kills a snake in a creekbed, but Beam's vocal harmonies are nearer to Simon and Garfunkel
    than Ralph Stanley. ""Southern Anthem"", meanwhile, brings to mind Crosby, Stills and Nash.</p><p>
    
    But any potential writhing or wincing is soon dissolved by ""Weary Memory"", the album's simplest and perhaps
    strongest track. Here, Beam's voice is all his, as he stretches out his vocal cords and displays a greater
    range than he had led the listener to believe he possessed. As the song peaks, all guitars but one drop out
    for a brief respite. ""Found a photo of when we were married,"" Beam sings, breaking the last word into two.
    ""Leaning back on a broken willow tree/ That's one memory I choose to carry/ Weary memory I can always see,""
    and he takes that ""see"" soaring skyward.</p><p>
<i>The Creek Drank the Cradle</i> is made of small epiphanies such as this. There are few guitar solos, if
    they can even be called that. Beam rarely gets adventurous with his voice, and the songs, for the most part,
    are of the same pace, tone, lyrical content. Written and performed to tape by Beam alone, the album could
    easily be lumped in with other home-recording talents such as John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats. But the
    music here has such deeps roots in a vast swath of Americana that the bedroom image just wouldn't suit Beam.</p><p>
    
    And please don't be fooled by the label. Sub Pop may not be the foremost purveyors of roots music, but
    they've proven before-- in the case of former Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan-- that they at least
    know good old-time country and blues music when they hear it. If indeed <i>The Creek Drank the Cradle</i>
    is only half of the material Beam submitted to the label, then hopefully there's some more Iron &amp; Wine
    on the way. It sure beats more mud and honey.</p></div>"|4126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4126-the-creek-drank-the-cradle/|8.1|Ryan Kearney

    HAIRCUT, collector-geek<br/>
    CHAIN-WALLET, collector-geek<br/>
    GOD, contender<br/>
    DARNIELLE, deity</p><p>
    
    [Setting: An abstract plane, duh. A skyline of CD cases. A tumbleweed sets itself on fire and rolls across the stage, where HAIRCUT and CHAIN-WALLET stroll and converse.]</p><p>
    
    Haircut: Oh despair. How are we to describe three rarities anthologies by John Darnielle's Mountain Goats?
    What is left to be said about what Darnielle concocts with a paucity of ingredients: haphazardly recorded
    acoustic guitar, spoken-then-hyperharmonizing vocals, and of course, his tremulous soul, which he threatens
    to overexpose?  We may as well have been asked to rhapsodize about a grilled cheese sandwich-- that treat
    similar to the Mountain Goats in that it is so much better than it should be, the consumption of which feels
    guiltless and light, despite its ominous cheesiness. But these CDs contain 185 minutes' worth of 81 songs.
    That's a geyser of simple sandwiches.</p><p>
    
    Chain-Wallet: I too am inclined to despair. I owned these songs in their vinyl, cassette, and compilation CD
    formats, makeshift covers and all. I even bought a freestanding CD burner with an analog input jack to make
    my own rarities discs. My check to Sing Eunuchs, signed by Simon Joyner himself, is still taped to my ukulele.
    I even bought the original release of <i>Protein Source of the Future... Now!</i> and <i>Bitter Melon Farm</i>
    when Ajax originally released them in 1999.  These songs have been with me too long. I feel as if I've been
    asked to discuss my own foot.</p><p>
    
    Haircut: Dude, there's no way you had ""Going to Kirby Sigston"" because <i>Hey Dan K</i> never came out.
    What are you going to do with that archive of rarities now that these capsules exist?</p><p>
    
    Chain-Wallet: That's why God made eBay.</p><p>
    
    [Enter GOD.]</p><p>
    
    God:  Affiliate me not with the genesis of eBay. I resent the construction ""that's why God made ________""
    when people just go on to cite something like flip-flops, Teddy Grahams, or condoms. My designs are much
    more complicated and counterintuitive-- grasshoppers, pineapples, tuberculosis. Sorry, I'm ranting.</p><p>
    
    [Exit GOD.]</p><p>
    
    Haircut: Perhaps the only strategy for comprehending these sacred texts would be for us to recount all that
    Darnielle has given us, even if we're made to feel like mere information-dispensers, or ATMs, in doing so.</p><p>
    
    Chain-Wallet: Firstly, these screeds ain't chronological, yet each disc evokes its own Mountain Goats ""period.""
    With <i>Protein Source of the Future... Now!</i>, we've been offered mostly the warm, mellow, imagistic
    Darnielle. The songs amble through the speakers' doom-sap and analyze love's overpromises. The narrators
    are viziers of tiny, silly empires, and Darnielle knows it-- his liner notes indicate that they project
    ""near-apocalyptic weight to their petty grievances."" That's no slight; in fact, the best songs here function
    like slice-of-vexed-life short stories without resolutions.</p><p>
    
    Haircut: Standouts include, but are not limited to, the annihilation-obsessed ""Two Thousand Seasons"", during
    which Darnielle is accompanied only by some kind of breezily buzzing whirligig, and ""Billy the Kid's Dream
    of the Magic Shoes"", a perfect example of Darnielle's singular penchant for clashing archetypes (here the
    outlaw-awaiting-death tradition meets a child's escapist fantasy). As the shortest of these three discs,
    and since it compiles several longer short projects (four-, five-, and eight-song releases), <i>Protein</i>
    plays like a mid-career full-length rather than a lost-back-catalog goulash.</p><p>
    
    Chain-Wallet: Which brings us to the considerably less twilit, and less ingratiating, <i>Bitter Melon Farm</i>.
    Darnielle's notes admit that its songs are ""strays"" and that the bitterness in the title explicitly refers
    to how they might be swallowed.  For some nebulous reason, this disc has an estate-sale grab-bag feel--
    sure, you get a lot for your money, but a lot of what?  Punctured hosepipes, plastic Christmas trees, and
    stained sweatpants? The limitations of the Goats's minimal formula are apparent here; even on the tracks
    that feature Darnielle's trusty boombox, the gears suggest a robo-cow chewing its robo-cud rather than an
    interesting no-fi texture.</p><p>
    
    Haircut: Still, the listener is treated to ""Going to Cleveland"", in which the singer is tortured by his
    partner's big eyes, despite how dedicated he is to his arrival in that brown city of eternal afternoons.
    ""No, I Can't"" is included twice, and this song is representative of the Goats's knack for using material
    thangs as objective correlatives for emotions and temporal connections. On these songs, a gift of, say, a
    filing cabinet changes the giftee's life convincingly, articulating the way sheer ""stuff"" can grip us. And
    two stellar covers emerge: though The Commodores and Ace of Base may seem more flippant than Darnielle's
    standard reappraisal-fare (Chet Baker, Minutemen, Ella Fitzgerald, Robert Johnson, Steely Dan), ""Sail On""
    and ""The Sign"" are solid numbers on a disc that occasionally feels vestigial. Some wool-gathering is afoot.</p><p>
    
    Chain-Wallet: The muzzy attenuation of <i>Bitter Melon Farm</i> as a whole are nullified by the glory that is
    <i>Ghana</i>, truly the proverbial ""one you've been waiting for"". If you are among those hand-to-mouth
    loser-imps who only own one-third of <i>69 Love Songs</i>, then <i>Ghana</i> is the ultimate Darnielle
    fraction for your fundamentally incomplete existence. The New Testament lords over this disc with fetching
    benevolence. As Darnielle works the underrated policies of Jesus and Paul into his purposefully un-epic
    tales of life-maintenance, the trademark Goats sententiousness peaks.  With ""Golden Boy"", an ode to a brand
    of peanuts (from <i>Object Lessons</i>, an EP on which Franklin Bruno and the Vehicle Flips also acquit
    themselves marvelously), Darnielle blends his frisky materialism and spiritualism, all the while blending
    his claustrophobic sobriety with his absurdist wit.</p><p>
    
    Haircut: My emotions are pretty much pickled, but ""The Last Day of Jimi Hendrix's Life"" sends me out to my
    balcony in Spanish Harlem, crying a slough of tears onto the chickens roaming the alley. The rousing history
    lesson ""The Anglo-Saxons"" is a gem, despite its admitted transgressions against facts. And ""Anti-Music Song""
    reigns as it trashes Morrissey (whom Darnielle calls ""Maureecey"", and with whom he has since reconciled),
    the remaining Beach Boy, and, I'm guessing, the Counting Crows's Adam Duritz when he sings of a ""bad
    imitation of Van Morrison.""</p><p>
    
    Chain-Wallet: The four songs fleshed out by Alaistar Galbraith are stunning. We can only hope that these violins
    are harbingers of the new Goats album that is days away from release, the album Darnielle insisted he'd never
    make, with a band (percussion-- gasp!) in a studio. <i>Ghana</i> is a damn relief pitcher: the capering
    guitars ideally suit the lyrics about introducing this manufactured world to the next, lyrics about ""heading
    straight to hell/ In a Lincoln Continental."" Probably one of the best and richest acoustic-only albums I own,
    and I own everything. All I do is own, actually.</p><p>
    
    Haircut: Whew, we got worked up there. Oh well, back to our meaningless toil. Back to waiting for the new
    album. And to hoping the Goats will persevere.</p><p>
    
    Chain-Wallet: Perseverance isn't always a good thing. Isn't it fucked up that the ""The Price Is Right"" is still
    making new episodes?</p><p>
    
    [Enter DARNIELLE.]</p><p>
    
    Haircut: Darnielle!</p><p>
    
    Chain-Wallet: It is he who will not abate!</p><p>
    
    Darnielle: It is I, Darnielle, who will not abate. My friends, I must ask: Now that you have these omnibuses,
    are you happy?</p><p>
    
    Haircut: Um, well, where's the re-release of your amazing cassettes <i>Hot Garden Stomp</i> and <i>The Hound
    Chronicles</i>? Why deny the digital-minded consumer the glory of your cover of ""Tell Me on a Sunday"", or
    the heartbreak of ""Going to Chino""?</p><p>
    
    Chain-Wallet: And when will you free your absolutely captivating father-haunted masterwork <i>New Asian Cinema</i>
    from the ghetto of a 500-copy run of one-sided vinyl? We'd like to purchase it on CD to give to a date, in
    the event that a date came along.</p><p>
    
    Darnielle: Ah, my friends. Proust wrote of artless art collectors and how they were eventually consumed by
    their consumption to the point that no opus can satiate them. Be patient. Maybe try a new food every other
    Wednesday. Memorize outdated maps. Just diversify your passions beyond the realm of the shrink-wrappable.</p><p>
    
    [Exit DARNIELLE.]</p><p>
    
    Haircut: But there will always be more CDs we need to buy.</p><p>
    
    Chain-Wallet: There will always be more CDs we need to buy.</p><p>
    
    Haircut: We will never be happy.</p><p>
    
    Chain-Wallet: We will never be happy.</p><p>

    1960s USA.  ""Kyoro"" kicks off with an incredibly raw drumbeat, pummeling you like countrymen High Rise at
    their worst.  The guitar builds up sizzling feedback, then unleashes a firestorm as a blood-curdling scream
    tears from your speakers.  It almost sounds like heavy metal, but the theatrics that follow pull the ripcord,
    decelerating into fun, anthemic riffage.  The group manages to make low fidelity an almost religious virtue
    later on ""Under a Clown"", with electric surges careening around the rattling drums and the sudden appearance
    of an abused piano being pounded.</p><p>
    Hailing from Oita, Japan, Xinlisupreme's dreamy synth-pop comes as quite a surprise.  Yasumi Okano and
    Takayuki Shouji conjure up dust from dance clubs of the 80s, evoking dirty, fog-cloaked backrooms.  ""All
    You Need is Love Was Not True"" thumps through eight minutes of flat drum machine beats, the dull thud
    masking the half-mumbled attempts to sing that float through the mix.  The patterns reassure, never boring,
    just guiding the body out onto the floor.  Not so with the wavering synth-static of ""Amaryllis"", but the
    repetitive motif creates a ritualized aura, enhanced by the duo's strange chanting.  The drama continues on
    ""Fatal Sisters Opened Umbrella"", which drives from a gothic groove straight into the heart of the cathedral
    itself, with insane blasts like pipe organs soaring upwards.</p><p>
    Think you've heard it all?  Xinlisupreme make you hear it all at once.  This mad twosome from the Far East
    cuts some of the nastiest noise-rock since the Birthday Party.  ""You Died in the Sea"" begins with Einstürzende
    beat-boxing, like anvils clanging on cold metal.  Without warning, the guitars snarl, shredding the song
    open in a vortex of distortion and drones.  The group isn't all hard edges, though; ""Suzu"", in particular,
    with its hazy mesh of soundwaves, will have you thumbing through your shoegazer glossary for acronyms like
    'FSA' and 'MBV'.  Likewise, ""I Drew a Picture of Myself"" paints perfect balance between shimmering airiness
    and barbed aggression, and features some of the grungiest basslines since <i>Gish</i>.</p><p>
    Forget titles like 'power electronics' or 'sonic terrorism'-- Xinlisupreme rain down slabs of pure noise
    from on high.  Keep countrymen Merzbow and Masonna in mind, but also think of Unit Records beatmongers
    Gridlock and Dryft.  ""Goodbye for All"" matches the snowy grainscapes of the former with the latter's
    electronic percussion, resulting in a cyclone of pulsing stabs and shrieking pitchshifts.  Like most
    masters of the extreme, the duo show mercy, thankfully, and the piece relents with an ambient midsection
    that calms before the storm ensues again.  Though the sketch only lasts two minutes, ""Symmetry"" remains
    particularly unsettling as it builds into a thicket of piercing nettles, reminding more of the phantasmagoric
    clouds conjured by Ah Cama-Sotz.</p><p>
    It should be obvious by now, but I'll say it outright: Xinlisupreme are all these things.  It's become a
    cliché these days to describe a band from Japan as 'wild' or 'crazy', but the evidence is right up in your
    face, kicking your teeth in.  Don't think about genre-hopping trend-setters-- Okano and Shouji blend these
    styles together with demented glee.  What you get is an hour's worth of helter-skelter sonic invention,
    lacking any coherent center.  This mania is their virtue, making for one of the year's most unpredictable
    albums, and a damn fine debut.  It's also their weakness.  Am I being too critical?  Imagine the Boredoms
    ten years back, and where they've come since.  Xinlisupreme are only beginning to rock.</p></div>"|8820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8820-tomorrow-never-comes/|8.1|Christopher Dare

Bach was obsessed with numerology and the practice of gematria,
    which says that each letter of the alphabet can be assigned a number.  Historians
    point out that, in his ""Vor deinen Thron"", the first part of melody has 14 notes
    (the numerological value of Bach's surname), and the entire melody has 41 (the
    numerological value of ""JS Bach"").  There's another Bach piece wherein he assigns
    specific notes to each letter of his name.  I had heard it many times before
    discovering how it was constructed, and enjoyed it, which makes one thing clear:
    though this information is an interesting aspect of the piece, it's hardly an
    essential component of enjoying the music.</p><p>
    
    Often, when artists have constructed a manifesto or methodology for their work,
    they feel it's necessary for this information to be known to people so that their
    music can be fully understood.  But there's an ongoing debate as to whether or not
    anyone besides the composer needs to know what's going on at the time of conception,
    and despite my momentary amusement when I discovered Bach's methodology, I can't
    say that it's ever really informed my admiration for the piece.  Squarepusher
    mastermind Tom Jenkinson, on the other hand, might not agree with me.  And I quote:</p><p>
<i>""To make a lethal attack on, say a musical standpoint, that standpoint must
    first be loved, understood and accommodated before it can be assailed, and
    this problem is exemplified with much youth culture that seeks to destroy
    its perceived antithetical enemy simply by contradicting it. It is not
    enough to behead your enemy, they must first be invited in and made to feel
    welcome in order to be comprehensively destroyed i.e. they must be in some
    way incorporated.""</i></p><p>
<i>Do You Know Squarepusher</i> comes with a small text file of Jenkinson's
    manifesto for his work-- and apparently, for anyone who would criticize his
    work.  What this quote implies is that I, as a critic and fan, am not allowed
    to diss him until I have loved him first.  And just to prove that he knows what
    he's talking about, he later goes on to say that he's ""learned to see inside
    every musician's head because, in order to prevent myself from being fully
    incorporated into any musical ghetto, I have to incorporate every musical ghetto
    into myself.""  Perhaps the real question, then, is ""Do You Know Yourself?""  If
    not, have no fear, because Squarepusher does.</p><p>
    
    Well, I've got good news for Jenkinson: I have loved Squarepusher!  I loved
    <i>Hard Normal Daddy</i>; I loved <i>Big Loada</i>; and I <i>really</i> loved
    <i>Music is Rotted One Note</i>.  The latter was particularly enjoyable because
    it allowed fans to glimpse a rare ""human"" side of Jenkinson-- even if it was a
    cold, dark human.  But if his above quote is any indication, the creation of that
    record also meant that he had loved, hated and somehow destroyed Miles Davis--
    the <i>worst</i> I can say about it was that it was <i>Bitches Brew</i> without
    the solos.  None of this is especially important when listening to his new
    two-disc release (blasphemy!), but if he's going to so much trouble to show me
    what a cannibalistic paradox he is, I figure I might as well play along.</p><p>
    
    The first disc wisely opens with the album's only worthwhile moment: the title
    track, which has already become a concert fave for fans.  It seems to fall
    squarely in line with the straightforward, melodic direction introduced with
    2000's ""My Red Hot Car"".  This isn't to say Squarepusher's going pop, but that
    this song has more in common with late-period Kraftwerk than modern-day electronica--
    it's basically a pop song decked out in electronic trickery, as opposed to
    clicks-and-cuts with occasional hints of melody.</p><p>
    
    On the other end of the spectrum are ""Kill Robok"" and ""Anstromm-Feck 4"".
    The former is comprised of progressively random pulse bursts, taking a block
    of code from the Autechre algorithm.  There's a beat in there, but it's held
    together by tempo only-- the actual bass and snare accents are all over the
    place.  Similarly, the latter song opens with a robo-voiced Jenkinson asking
    if I think I'm ""fucking hard"" (I thought he already knew!), before launching
    into ever-so-ordinary car-chase music.</p><p>
    
    ""Mutilation Colony"" begins with some ominously pretty keyboard clusters that
    sound oddly similar to Jenkinson's old buddy Bach.  The first few minutes of
    this tune are a melancholy change of pace, with shimmering chords extended and
    stretched until their resonance dries up.  After a bit of this, he raids
    Stockhausen's back catalog by introducing the beloved Academic Electronic
    Composition.  Over the course of the succeeding eight minutes or so, Squarepusher
    abandons hyperactive IDM for a rather pedestrian noise experiment.  And as for
    his breathy cover of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"", I'm guessing Joy Division were
    too tough a dish to love, hate and spit out.</p><p>
    
    The second disc, titled <i>Alive in Japan</i>, documents a July 2001 show.  Now, I
    can see the appeal of <i>going</i> to a Squarepusher show, but you don't get quite
    the same experience in your living room.  The biggest thrill here, beyond hearing
    stuff from <i>Go Plastic!</i> and <i>Do You Know Squarepusher</i> with acoustic
    interference, is his periodic interjections of ""let's hear some fucking noise!""
    or ""gimme some fucking noise!!""  Were Jenkinson to issue this performance as a
    standalone release, I imagine Warp would have had no interest in it.</p><p>
    
    In the end, reading ""Tom's Manifesto"" probably isn't going to alter anyone's
    perception of <i>Do You Know Squarepusher</i>.  Just like Bach, Jenkinson's
    best stuff gets by not on his calculated pre-production or any meta-cognitive
    powers of enlightenment, but because on some level, it connects with other
    people.  By the same token, this set is disappointing not because I don't
    understand his methodology, but because the results simply aren't terribly
    engaging.</p></div>"|7448.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7448-do-you-know-squarepusher/|4.8|Dominique Leone

Hell, even my ill-fated
    all-Blondie ska band, One Way or Your Mother, came close to inking a deal with Capitol back in the day.
    Longing for an earlier time, perhaps, or maybe sensing the pop/punk (or punk/pop) revival that draws
    inevitably near as a counter-response to emo's hyper sincerity, Lookout! Records has taken the initiative
    and released a remastered and expanded version of the Mr T Experience's 1995 EP <i>...And the Women Who
    Love Them</i>.  They're a bit early, sure, but that's so they can say they were doing it before it was cool.</p><p>
<i>""Give us a cheeky cover of Duran Duran's 'Is There Something I Should Know?'!"", the clamoring masses will
    shout.</i></p><p>
    
    ""Got it right here,"" Lookout! will duly respond.</p><p>
<i>""How about a snotty version of Elton John and Kiki Dee's doe-eyed duet 'Don't Go Breaking my Heart'?""</i></p><p>
    
    ""Again, got you covered.""</p><p>
    
    If things keep going the way they are, we might even see a resurgence of the word ""alternative"" in pop music
    parlance (remember when it meant something?)-- in which case, MTX will surely be poised to end all their
    encores with the anthemic ""Alternative is Here to Stay"". ""Man, were these boys prescient?"" we'll ask. A
    veritable Oracle of Delphi, this band.</p><p>
    
    Yeah, you might as well jump on the wagon early and pick up a copy of this expanded EP.  After all, besides
    the seven songs that appeared on the original, you'll now get 18 (!) more-- contemporaneous seven-inch
    singles, demos and outtakes from the sessions, and various comp appearances spanning from 1993-1997-- which,
    for bargain-bin prices, is more Mr T Experience than you could ever possibly need.  Still, taken a song at a
    time, this stuff's pretty damn fun.  It's your basic Ramones/Buzzcocks-descended punk rock, but the lyrics
    are great if you've ever been dumped (""My new girlfriend is better than you/ She's got bigger breasts and a
    higher IQ,"" from ""New Girlfriend"") or have found a new love just as pathetic as you are (""You're much more
    than MST3K or D&amp;D;/ I'm King Dork and I want you to be my queen"").</p><p>
    
    So, alright, maybe you'll never want to listen to this EP straight through, but it's perfect fodder between
    Smiths and Cure songs on that mixtape you're making for that girl you have a crush on. She'll think it's old
    Green Day, and you'll appear smart when you tell her about MTX and how they came from the same scene but
    were first.  Plus, their Mr T reference predates Inspecta Collect.  You're in, dude, you're so <i>in</i>.</p></div>"|5480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5480-and-the-women-who-love-them-special-addition/|5.9|Jason Nickey

    over a wide range of oddball ground in a career that's going on 25 years now.  The The first crawled up from
    the periphery of England's post-punk scene, though they ultimately ended up walking territory that had more
    in common with acts like Oingo Boingo than Gang of Four and Wire.  Johnson's first records were more oblique,
    though, with the debut single ""Controversial Subject"" and full-length <i>Burning Blue Soul</i> espousing a
    dark, paranoid sound run through with hissing tape collage and murky, impenetrable production.</p><p>
    
    For this compilation, though, Johnson and Epic Records have opted to ignore those early recordings, and
    instead jumping right into 1982, when The The was already four years old and had moved into a much quirkier,
    more danceable sound.  The production values on most of this stuff are almost painfully dated to the 1980s,
    with cavernous echo on the snares, thin digital synth sounds, and massed female backing vocals, but the
    sound is also clear enough to reveal Johnson's inventiveness as an arranger and composer.</p><p>
    
    The zylimba (sounds like a drunk marimba) that opens ""Uncertain Smile"" (originally released in 1982) makes
    for a very off-balance intro to what turns out to be a fairly down-to-earth jangly rock song, albeit with
    some cockeyed little saxophone bits laid carefully around the edges of the melody.  Johnson's voice is a
    pretty decent tenor, but there's always a slightly affected edge to his delivery that highlights the themes
    of isolation, war, religion and human behavior that are his lyrical stock in trade.</p><p>
    
    As the decade wore on, Johnson's arrangements became more ambitious, incorporating orchestration and moving
    a bit away from the heavy programming that colors his early work.  1986's <i>Infected</i> turned up the
    lushness a bit, as well as the danceability quotient, though the title track hasn't aged terribly well.
    Ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr joined The The for a several years in the late 80s and early 90s, and his
    soulful harmonica played an important part in Johnson's move toward a more organic sound, beginning in 1989
    with the <i>Mind Bomb</i> LP.</p><p>
    
    The two <i>Mind Bomb</i>-era songs included here illustrate the extremes of the synthetic and the organic in
    his work, with ""The Beat(en) Generation"" playing with a rootsier (though no less heavily produced) sound and
    a fairly basic arrangement.  But the other offering, ""Armageddon Days (Are Here Again)"", is unforgivably
    cheesy, an adjective that I try to apply sparingly, but just can't avoid here.  The cartoonish, ""menacing""
    chorus vocals, a mob of pitch-shifted Johnsons, Marrs, and a few other co-conspirators, and ridiculous
    lyrics like, ""If the real Jesus Christ were to stand up today, he'd be gunned down cold by the CIA,"" make
    for a few good chuckles all these years later.  The chorus refrain of ""Islam is rising/ The Christians
    mobilizing"" might seem chillingly prescient in today's world if the delivery was a little less self-consciously
    dramatic.</p><p>
    
    Also included on a second disc is a fairly inconsequential compilation of twelve-inch remixes that add little
    to the overall package-- most are simply longer versions of the songs on the first disc.  It would have been
    much more gratifying to get some sort of selection of rare tracks from the band's three unreleased albums or
    perhaps their debut single, ""Controversial Subject"".  The liner notes do trumpet a volume two to this set
    slated for next year, though, so it seems as though some of those holes may yet be plugged.</p></div>"|7982.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7982-45-rpm-the-singles/|7.0|Joe Tangari

    Low have worked up quite a backstory.  With tools provided by Galaxie 500, Red House Painters, and Spacemen
    3, their first two albums, 1994's <i>I Could Live in Hope</i> and 1995's <i>Long Division</i>, drew the
    blueprint for slowcore as we know it today.  They are the pioneers of a genre of limited variables-- where
    innovating artists who drift too far to the left become ""drone"" or ""psychedelic"", and those who drift to the
    right find themselves labeled ""dream-pop"" or ""shoegazer""-- which bloomed in the mid-to-late 90s, but now
    seems somewhat short on ideas.</p><p>
    The band, of course, hasn't let this hold them back.  Critics have been waiting to pounce since 1997, after
    their first three undeniably solid, yet painfully uniform, albums had sunk in.  Then, Low switched from the
    Vernon Yard label to Chicago-based experimental imprint Kranky and released the unexpected <i>Songs for a
    Dead Pilot</i> EP, which saw them toying with a whole new arsenal of unpredicted elements, and greatly
    broadening their field of vision.  But after this stark contrast to their previous releases, some fans who
    had been hoping Low would to continue to branch out were mildly disappointed by <i>Secret Name</i>, which
    failed to deviate much from paths the band had already explored.  And some feared this would, in fact, be
    the end of the road for the good-natured trio from Minnesota's northeast.  Yet, despite this, their songcraft
    remained intact-- but this in itself was also a problem: though their songwriting had never been compromised,
    it had never really developed much, either.  Hence, their albums up to this point-- save the <i>Songs for a
    Dead Pilot</i> EP-- were virtually interchangeable, none any better or worse than the others.</p><p>
    And then came 2001's <i>Things We Lost in the Fire</i>.  Low, it seemed, had suddenly realized that their
    songwriting could not sustain with reverb alone, and hired producer Steve Albini and a group of contributors
    with more explorative backgrounds, resulting in their freshest-sounding album to date.  One would expect
    this to carry over to their follow-up, the newly released <i>Trust</i>.  In fact, it doesn't.  Only now do
    Low seem to be struggling with the constraints of their genre.  The album preserves their defining qualities:
    superb lyricism and powerful tension.  But it's missing two key elements of Low's last outing.  That is, the
    engaging songs and captivating production.</p><p>
    The ever-cautious pace and utter minimalism of slowcore can make for a grindingly protracted listening
    experience when the songs aren't up to snuff.  And on <i>Trust</i>, for the first time in Low's long career,
    they aren't.  The band's delivery is dispassionate and inert, and the deep mood swings that have typified
    some of their best outings-- the spiritual highs and dramatic depths-- are entirely absent.  To the band's
    credit, it's evident that they were at least making an effort: ""I Am The Lamb"", for example, attempts to
    draw electricity from the clunky, hollow footsteps of clattering percussion, while vocalist Alan Sparhawk
    provides a dirgeful minor-key melody atop the mélange, accompanied by a funerary chorus.  Unfortunately,
    neither his melody, nor the building force in the percussion, ever reaches the palpable intensity toward
    which it was clearly aiming, leaving the song to drag lifelessly towards its obvious conclusion for an
    exhausting seven minutes.  Later, ""John Prine"" meets a similar fate, crawling along with a languid bass
    drum pounding ceaselessly with little-to-no variation over roughly the same timespan.</p><p>
    So let's talk now about what <i>Trust</i> actually has going for it: Low makes a welcome foray into the
    world of tempo-- and with some success, even-- on ""Canada"", which is about as close as Low will likely ever
    come to a call-and-response anthem.  The tune, a wistfully poppy, fuzzed-out rock number, features Sparhawk
    on lead with Mimi Parker on echo, for a delightful sort of ""psychedelic-Breeders"" effect. ""Snowstorm"" tones
    the fuzz down a notch, but keeps the cheery attitude for a pretty pleasurable pop track.  At other points,
    such as on the percussionless folk-lullaby ""Tonight"" and the gorgeous, gospel-inflected ""Point of Disgust"",
    Low beautifully revisit more of their well-worn old ground, again neither improving nor altering the formula--
    just doing it well, as always.</p><p>
    But despite <i>Trust</i>'s striking moments, the album as a whole fails to engage.  Whatever intensity might
    be inherent in these songs is, for the most part, left untapped by Blake's production, and the resulting
    soundscapes lumber along with a stoic demeanor that leaves the listener unmoved.  You won't mind owning
    this album-- you probably won't even mind listening to it-- but if you want more Low in your collection,
    your money would be better spent on one of their others.</p></div>"|4891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4891-trust/|6.5|Brad Haywood

    to even say the words ""concept album"" without wincing and imagining the elves and druids of prog-rock past.
    The only thing less palatable than a concept album is an annotated concept album that explicitly states
    each song's plot and theme.  So when I cracked open the new Lif and discovered the aforementioned attributes
    in brazen attendance, it was difficult to fight back the urge to toss it into the trash bin.  However, after
    giving <i>I Phantom</i> a few spins, I must say that Lif has managed to transcend the gimmicks and wankery
    that generally mar this kind of grand opus, and emerge with his strongest offering yet.</p><p>
    
    Lif's success can largely be attributed to his focus on themes that other, more timid emcees wouldn't even
    touch; the album tackles the dehumanizing dysfunction of capitalism and its dramatic effect upon a b-boy
    everyman, including a dissection of commerce's influence upon art, family and spirituality.  The phantom of
    the title is the individual personality/soul that has been drowned in a flood of media-fueled consumerism,
    empty labor, and abandoned relationships. Explaining his themes in a recent interview with <i>SOHH</i>, Lif
    commented, ""Our identity is essentially wiped out in many ways. Under the code of professionalism, you do
    not bring your slang or culture into a place of business... there's a code of conduct which wipes out any
    flare that we have as individuals.""</p><p>
    
    The plot of <i>I Phantom</i> has four acts: an initial dream state where Lif is killed and resurrected; a
    second act where Lif awakens and struggles with poverty and social alienation; a third where Lif achieves
    financial success only to find it emotionally and spiritually bankrupt; and a final, surreal postscript
    where he and his friends lyrically navigate the apocalypse.  As you can imagine, this sure as fuck ain't
    <i>Nellyville</i>.  In fact, the album's thematic and narrative scope has more in common with Jonathan
    Franzen's <i>The Corrections</i> than it does with a hip-hop album.</p><p>
    
    In the first two songs, Lif cops a gun from Cannibal Ox's Vast Aire and is killed while robbing a store.
    ""Return of the B-Boy"", the album's third track, finds Lif resurrected as a hip-hop messiah.  ""Return of
    the B-Boy"" is a nearly eight-minute epic that is the most lyrically and musically accomplished track Def
    Jux has ever released.  Beneath a noisy mosaic of turntable scratches, squealing effects and bass-heavy
    beats, El-P drops Guru rapping, ""Hip-hop, Im'a bring it back, hip-hop..."" Then, as the noise reaches a
    crescendo, the beat drops and the track transforms into a fast and funky boom bap revival, replete with
    James Brown grunts and an '89-style fast rap.</p><p>
    
    On ""Mic Check,"" Lif declares, ""How the fuck did you figure you could interfere with a music so potent?""
    ""Mortal Kombat"" style, Lif steps up and destroys the Pharisees, Uncle Toms, and Jiggas who've transformed
    hip-hop from a culturally relevant lifeforce to an aural billboard for excess and self-destruction. In a
    particularly vivid confrontation with a subpar emcee, Lif raps, ""I step to him slow and look deep in his
    eye/ Say the prison is within 'cuz he's living a lie.""</p><p>
    
    The song ends suddenly, and a ringing alarm carries over to provide a segue to the next song where Lif
    awakens to find himself preparing to go to the ""slave quarters"" where he toils for a ""trifling hourly wage
    of $6.50."" In the spiritually arid atmosphere of ""Live from the Plantation"", Lif is confronted with the
    working man's irony: ""Life is a gift to be enjoyed every second.../ Yet I find myself looking at the clock,
    hoping for the day to fly by.""  Once again, the song shifts in the middle and we're treated to a beatbox
    breakdown that sounds like Doug E Fresh remixed by Autechre. The juxtaposition between the b-boy heroism of
    ""Return of the B-Boy"" and the everyday struggle of ""Live From the Plantation"" reveals that the tensions
    provided by the crippling minutiae of real life are just as dramatic and compelling as any superhero
    theatrics.</p><p>
    
    After failing at work on ""Live from the Plantation"", and being socially spurned due to his economic condition
    in ""Status"", Lif turns his eyes to the cash prize in ""Success"" and becomes a professional slave who's ""forced
    to give [his] life away while [he's] earning a living.""  Putting forth the professional's mantra, Lif raps,
    ""Smile, don't be too proud, too wild/ You can suffer, but just don't be too loud.""  Fellow Def Jukie Aesop
    Rock guests on the track, returning to many of the same themes he dealt with on last year's <i>Labor Days</i>.
    In a stinging chorus, Aesop raps, ""Daddy had a name tag that said 'busy working'/ Mommy had a milk carton
    that said 'missing person'/ John had a new baseball glove, but nobody to learn with/ The oil left the water
    and the water kept searching.""</p><p>
    
    Over the course of the next two songs, our narrator sees his family dissolve due to his workaholism. After
    divorcing his first wife, the narrator remarries and focuses on having the perfect (read: fictional) family
    and ignores his first, unsuccessful family.  The subsequent pressure to succeed causes his daughter from
    the second marriage to commit suicide. On ""The Now"",  Lif flips the script and raps from the perspective of
    the abandoned child from the first marriage.  It's a creative and revelatory point of view that showcases
    Lif's incredible narrative skills.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, Lif abandons the concrete details of his narrative on ""Iron Helix"" and answers the question
    as to ""how we got here, meaning how did we [get to] this point in human existence where these types of
    social ills are common.""  For the next song, ""Earthcrusher"", Lif provides ""a visual for the nuclear
    holocaust.""  Um... Druids, anyone?</p><p>
    
    Still, Lif's point has been made, and the last tracks' interesting, yet misguided forays into ponderous
    sci-fi don't ruin Lif's masterpiece. On his previous EPs, <i>Emergency Rations</i> and <i>Enter the
    Collosus</i>, Lif showed a lot of potential.  <i>I Phantom</i> is the big payoff, the album that we knew
    Lif had in him.  While there are those who accuse Lif of being unpatriotic and overly didactic, a searing
    social critique in this time of unchecked nationalism and media disinformation is not only refreshing, but
    absolutely necessary. Whether out of fear, complacency or self-absorption, there have been far too few
    voices of dissent to emerge from the world of independent music.  That Lif is willing to be the odd man
    out-- especially in a time when publicly questioning the actions of our administration is considered
    rote, despite the fact that we need it now more than ever-- is exemplary.  'Nuff respect due.</p></div>"|5474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5474-i-phantom/|8.3|Sam Chennault

As I type     this after a grueling day sweating over some godforsaken collection of     paperwork, it is obvious that all that hubbub over peace, love and casual     sex was but an extended Spring Break for a generation that, while idealistic     and pretty, is probably counting their blessings that nobody pulled the plug     on their party sooner.  I can only imagine what it must have been like to     actually <em>believe</em> people could change the world with love.  Did those     kids see the darkness on the edge of town, or was a just a three- or four-year     festival light?</p><p>Some might argue that the hippies never actually went away, but merely     retreated into various Utopian communities on the outskirts of Yucatan     bungalow hideaways.  The past, however, is littered with the remains of     broken dreams and shattered crystals of this forgotten society.  Whatever     happened to the Maharishi?  Where is the mystical Gaian way of life today?     Can we eat the brown ones yet??  And just how did Brazil's Spectrum lose     their way?</p><p>Spectrum-- comprised of one-name wonders Fernando, Ramon, Caetano, Serghino     and Tiao-- was formed in the late 60s by a group of local Rio de Janeiro     kids who had a fondness for the Beatles and imported ideas of the hippie     revolution.  Most of their instruments belonged to their school (they started     the band as teens), or were borrowed or handed down.  They practiced at school,     and were fairly popular for birthday parties and clubs.  Shortly after     christening themselves Spectrum, they were invited to contribute the soundtrack     to ""Brazil's First Hippie Film"", <em>Geração Bendita</em>.  Of course, Brazil's     military regime didn't take too kindly to gratuitous hair and bandanas onscreen,     so even though the movie was completed in 1971, it was banned for another two     years.  Spectrum couldn't hold out that long, and despite dreams of bringing     the word to thousands of impressionable young Brazilians, they gradually packed     it in and went back to their Rio suburb.</p>
<p>What we have now is that soundtrack, in all its grainy glory.  The thing is,     Spectrum had heart and sometimes even a knack for nice group vocal harmonies     like their idols, The Beatles.  However, like many an aspiring psychedelic     outfit, their enthusiasm didn't produce many classic tunes.  Most of their     music was highly derivative of late 60s legends like Traffic, The Easybeats     and, of course, The Fab Four.  Nevertheless, there are pleasures to be plundered     here, and psych aficionados should dig it.</p>
<p>Spectrum's best stuff is often as whimsical as that of their idols', if not quite     as accomplished.  ""Quiabo's"" features the wavering yelp of Fernando, some nifty     harmonies and more fuzz-guitar than you can shake a peacepipe at.  ""Concerto     Do Pantano"" forgoes vocals entirely to bring you the gospel according to     Flange, as it was told to disciples Clumpy Drums and Reverb.  Spectrum even     get funky on ""15 Years Old"", summoning the spirits of The Pretty Things and Jimi     Hendrix.  I'm not sure this music is going to awaken as many ghosts today, as     Spectrum's legacy seems oddly similar to dozens of spunky psych bands from all     over who simply never made it past the local rec center.  Good karma says to check     out <em>Nuggets</em> first; Spectrum will understand.</p></div>"|7411.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7411-geracao-bendita/|6.5|Dominique Leone

    mic skills need to show some serious improving.  On their previous effort,
    <i>Fantastic Vol 2</i>, producer Jay Dee laid down some nice tracks, but his
    flows, along with those of fellow SV emcees T3 and Baatin, lacked any
    vitality, focus or energy.  Apparently, Jay Dilla, who has also provided
    production work for A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul,  heard the criticism
    and stepped away from the group, ostensibly citing that he was tired of
    touring.  For <i>Trinity</i>, Slum Village have enlisted emcee Elzhi to assume
    Jay's mic duties while largely relying upon T3 to take over the boards.  For
    most, the question wasn't ""will they succeed?"" but ""how can they possibly?""</p><p>
    Their first single, ""Tainted"", finds Slum Village returning to familiar
    territory. With a chill vibe and harmonious R&amp;B; crooning, it's more than a
    little reminiscent of Fantastic's ""Players"". The lyrics are clichéd but
    forgivable, and although the emcees' flows are nothing memorable, they
    aren't obtrusive, either.  Off the relative strength of that single, one
    might suppose that Slum Village has managed to survive the departure of
    their most talented member.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, ""Tainted"" is one of the few bright spots on a very mediocre
    album.  After a few tracks, it becomes increasingly more difficult to ignore
    the pathetic lyrics and boring flows-- even the production seems redundant,
    bland, and horribly imitative and regressive.  In the song ""Disco"", the Slum
    Village emcees manage to fill three minutes with complete lyrical nonsense:
    ""Thug ass niggas want to disco,"" declares the chorus.  Um, no.  To paraphrase
    Chuck D, hip-hop was created 'cuz we <i>never</i> dug disco. ""Unisex"" sounds
    like a throw-away Neptunes beat with a weak freestyle pushed way down in the
    mix. Like many songs on this overstuffed 22-song clunker, it has no business
    seeing the light of day.</p><p>
    Fortunately, Jay Dilla does return for three tracks.  While those, along with
    the instrumental closer ""Fallin' in Love"", do showcase some really smooth
    production, it's a case of too little, too late.  By this point, the album has
    choked on its own sour cocktail of muddled flows, mediocre beats and cheap
    imitations.   While <i>Trinity</i> may not be the worst album of the year, it
    is one that will be forgotten very, very quickly.</p></div>"|7251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7251-trinity-past-present-and-future/|4.5|Sam Chennault

Not just because
    of the simple annoyances that sort of thing would tend to cause (everybody always
    trying to eat you, sticking to the roof of your own mouth, etc), but because
    people would constantly be attempting to combine you with other things.  No one
    digs peanut butter in and of itself, only when it's mixed with other foodstuffs--
    jelly, chocolate, you name it.  You would have recurring nightmares involving
    Elvis, a deep fryer, and a bunch of bananas.  Of course, this would wreak havoc
    on your self-esteem:  ""Am I not good enough on my own?  Why won't you love me
    for me?"" you would moan nightly, weeping into your sticky, sticky pillow and
    cursing the day George Washington fucking Carver was born.</p><p>
    Catherine Irwin, I'd imagine, is in a somewhat similar situation.  Her work
    with Janet Bean in Freakwater earned the band comparisons with every great
    vocal duo in country history, from Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris on, and
    Freakwater's staunch refusal to acknowledge the last 30 years of that history
    ingratiated them with roots purists and indie kids alike.  And Freakwater did
    have some serious, J Lo-Affleck style alchemy going on; Irwin's morose
    static-crackle sobs and Bean's sweeter, brassier voice were a one-in-a-billion
    combination.  Adulation, of course, is also limitation; what could either one
    do for an encore?  After you've nailed (crucified, even) harmony, can you ever
    go back to melody?</p><p>
    Irwin sure can.  Considering the hundreds of ways a solo album can go wrong
    (orchestral overcompensation, rote repetition of previous band, self-conscious
    departure from previous band, or [ack] superstar duets and guest shots), it's
    shocking how right <i>Cut Yourself a Switch</i> sounds.  While the style is
    no different from what Freakwater has always done, the sound shies away from
    the full-band approach the band had been pursuing over their last few albums.
    No dobros, just an occasional fiddle or accordion-- besides Irwin and her guitar,
    the only other constant presence here is longtime Freakwater player David Wayne
    Gay, whose barely-there bass adds a fullness to the sound without ever stepping
    on Irwin's voice.  As much as Freakwater were purists, <i>Cut Yourself a Switch</i>
    represents a further distillation of what was already concentrated stuff.</p><p>
    Which should, by all reasoning, be too much.  Irwin's pit-of-sorrow vocals were
    maudlin almost to the point of parody in Freakwater, balanced out by Bean's more
    upbeat tone.  Here, though, Irwin takes the opportunity to spread out.  ""Hex"" and
    ""Swan Dive"" showcase opposite ends of Irwin's range, from almost impossibly fragile
    and paper-thin on the former, to sweeping and strident on the latter.  She can do
    seductive better than ever, too; challenge me to keep my pants on during ""Power of
    My Love"".  C'mon, you could probably win some money off of me.</p><p>
    As per usual, <i>Cut Yourself a Switch</i> is about half originals and half
    covers.  Irwin's songs stick closely to the lyrical tradition of love, death,
    misfortune, and Jesus, Jesus, Jesus while at the same time constantly rearranging
    these clichés.  ""Dirty Little Snowman"" is a weird combination of childhood memory
    and debased creation myth, all wrapped up in a beautiful accordion line; ""My Old
    Unlucky Home Far Away"" is a more upbeat tune about vampires (among other things);
    and in ""Needle in a Haystack"", Irwin urges us between trusty voice cracks to ""burn
    the damn thing down/ And you'll find your precious needle laying right there on
    the ground.""</p><p>
    While all of her songs adhere to her usual standards, the covers are uniformly
    fascinating.  The aforementioned ""Power of My Love"", a smoldering, weirdly
    aggressive Elvis tune, gets a feminist makeover from Irwin and her banjo, while
    she gives the Carter Family's love-from-beyond-the-grave song ""Will You Miss Me""
    a more standard but still impassioned treatment.  Irwin's rendition of ""Don't We
    All Have the Right to Be Wrong"" by Roger Miller (country Roger Miller, not Mission
    of Burma Roger Miller) grows slightly more damaged and desperate with every chorus.
    For Shockabilly's ""The Only Hell My Momma Ever Raised"", Irwin actually brings out
    a full band, and they weave blissfully through the song like a drunken getaway
    car in slow traffic.</p><p>
    The closer, though, frosts the cake.  Irwin puts a perfectly scattershot
    slide-guitar sheen on the doo-wop standard ""You Belong to Me"", her breathy
    vocals transforming the original while making it sound agelessly older at the
    same time.  Which is, of course, Irwin's great talent.  Each song is a trip
    into an invented past, but after each one ends you come back up with something
    raw, real, and pure that you can't quite shake off.  Like, if you will, dipping
    your fingers into a jar of peanut butter.  I'd ask you to forgive my metaphors,
    but after <i>Cut Yourself a Switch</i>, I trust the Good Lord will instead.</p></div>"|4132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4132-cut-yourself-a-switch/|8.5|Brendan Reid

Prepare yourselves for a fake-journalism mega-pun that emulates the stylings of the bikini-baiting
    <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>; I'm talking cleverness on par with ""'Friends' Star Matthew Enjoying Rehab
    'Perry' Much"".  Ready?  ""Moistboyz Have Dried Up.""  Get it?  Because moisture can dry!  Hoo, boy!  This
    golden stuff just comes to me, even with a sinus infection.  I'll give you a minute to clean your pants.</p><p>
    
    Yawn. I know this Ween side project is supposed to be a spoof, but the best spoofs transcend their targets.
    If you're going to dip down into genre-muck, you should be careful not to get any on you.  Moistboyz are
    starting to sound the opposite of inspired, as idea-less as the sociopathic thrash pose they're aiming to
    lampoon.  And this is coming from a devoted show-taping Weenie, who signed on with their debut and kept
    smiling along as they worshipped cosmic stallions and delivered doomed monologues from the perspective of
    children with spinal meningitis.</p><p>
    
    I keep a pocket-sized carbon-dating kit handy to annoy Christians and to test the vintagicity of thrift-store
    denim jackets.  When I played this album into it, the thing thought 2002's <i>III</i> was at least ten years
    old, with certain moments going farther back into the wanky eras of Judas Priest and W.A.S.P.  No fooling,
    the Moistboyz concept (profane, insanely distorted chunks of standard brag-and-threat metal vitriol) ages
    aggressively, the same way sports highlights from a noon game look like they were filmed during the Korean
    War when they're replayed at midnight, isolated as they are from their only momentary significance/payoff.</p><p>
    
    Fun is to be had on this disc, though: every echoed handclap is guffaw-inducing. The hellish ""Yeah!"" that
    opens ""The Spike"" (with its characteristic chorus, ""The spike! The spike!"") legitimately induces
    furniture-burning.  ""The Tweaker"" is a keeper, with its authentically chaotic guitar wail and bullying
    tempo. The song is hilarious, if manifestly impolitic, as it chronicles people vomiting up their testicles,
    Satan assisting with drug acquisition, brittle penises falling off on contact, and tips to avoid being a
    ""hippie faggot"".  The centerpiece is ""I'm Gonna Kick Your Ass"", as it flagrantly cops the second half of
    the riff from ""Iron Man"" and boasts lyrics such as ""Talkin' that shit-- <i>you're mine!</i>"" and my
    favorite: ""Asshole/ The shit is going down right now/ Put down the kid and run/ Daddy's gonna die/
    Wave bye-bye.""</p><p>
    
    But puerile thunder can only rumble so long, and ultimately, this project suggests the unfunniness of
    Tenacious D's valleys, or a backwards-moving Ween, as if they're over-revisiting their early work. Moistboyz
    just performed a show they billed as ""Retardapalooza"", and that's a clue as to just how ""Beavis &amp; Butthead""/Spencer
    Gifts this album can be. The human rhythm section sounds unpromisingly like drum machine programming (a la
    mid-90s Al Jourgensen), which makes the rock seem strangely contained, like havoc trapped in a Skinner box.
    Titles such as ""Great American Zero"" and ""I Am the Reaper"" should be sufficient to communicate how tired
    things get. The lyrics intermittently scan as clunkily as the predictable doggerel people send in to
    newspapers' obituary sections. If you still go around ranking your top ten farts or playing mailbox
    baseball, or if you want cartoon-morbid songs about eating Mickey Moist's leavings, purchase away.  Else,
    leave it for someone's ten-year-old brother.</p></div>"|5372.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5372-iii/|5.6|William Bowers

Were I the head of a record label (star light, star bright!), I'd connive all manner of misfortune to justify     ultra-low press runs.  ""The album was found to contain dangerously high frequencies and/or seizure-inducing     strobe rhythms; we had to recall it.""  ""John Ashcroft has seized the majority of our inventory and shipped     it to Guantanamo Bay under suspicions of anti-Americanism.""  Or maybe tell the band the album is ""too     experimental"", drop them from my label, leak the music to the Internet, and re-sign them under a different     imprint... oh, wait, that one's already been done.  Steve Case, you magnificent evil bastard!</p>
<p>Whichever story I choose, I'd cast it out there, wait a couple years while the hype train builds to immense     speed, then BAM!, reissue the album and watch the bank account swell.  I'm not accusing the assumedly fine     lads at Temporary Residence Ltd of such unsavory practices, nor am I suspicious of London post-rock-ish     trio Fridge.  But hey, the story fits the mold, as the press kit makes clear: <i>EPH</i> was released in     1999 on British label Go!Beat, but only using the highly unpopular, hard-to-find, and absurdly expensive     rollout plan.  Now it's being reissued for all us neglected statesiders and poor people, with the added     attraction of a bonus disc featuring EPs of that same pre-millennial era, plus a couple new remixes.  This     mini-Fridge has been converted into a Kegerator!  Haw haw, thanks folks, I'll be here all week!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the music world might've passed <i>EPH</i> by while it languished in high-priced import bin     obscurity.  Back in 1999, when Tortoise's <i>TNT</i> was a mere one year old, this disc probably sounded     like some fresh dope shiznit, what with its atmospheric instrumental rock sound laced with chopped-up     reel-to-reel drums and a veritable genus of keyboard species.  Much of the album has that movie score     quality that many of the band's peers were also flogging at the time, Krautishly named tracks like ""Ark""     and ""Aphelion"" riding hypnotic grooves for upwards of eight minutes at a time.</p>
<p>It's too bad it kinda sounds dated these days, since Fridge had the goods to be considered one of the top     performers of the genre.  The band excels at crafting a happy medium between organics and electronics     (guitarist Kieran Hebden is aka Four Tet), with compositions like ""Transience"" and the horn-stuffed ""Bad     Ischi"" maintaining a fluid, improvised vibe rather than the overly calculated constructions of other     post-rock acts.  <i>EPH</i> isn't quite past its expiration date (""Meum"" has a delicate musicbox sound     that would fit right in with recent Björk fare), but it's got just a small, distracting whiff of sourness     in a genre has since proven distinctly limited.</p>
<p>Holding up better is the bonus second disc, compiling the ""Kinoshita Terasaka"" single, the <i>Of</i> EP,     and remixes of <i>EPH</i> tracks by Matthew Herbert and P Pulsinger.  The single might be the highlight of     the set, coupling a short piece propelled by a tentatively booty-shaking bassline with a long, trancy     groove set that rewards the patient of heart... before kicking sand in the eyes of said patient of heart     with a completely gratuitous outro drum solo.  The <i>Of</i> EP features four dull versions of the <i>EPH</i> track of the same name, but stay tuned for the remixes, which do Fridge the favor of updating their songs     to the conventions of the modern day.  Herbert's take on ""Ark"" radically reconstructs the Very Serious     original as thinking man's dancefloor anthem, adding minor-key piano chords and a chopped-up diva vocal.     P Pulsinger, meanwhile, distorto-amplifies the bassline of ""Bad Ischi"" into a window-rattling irregular     skip-hop that Scott Herren would be proud of.</p>
<p>Too bad these two reworkings emphasize how dated the actual reissued album sounds today, when cutting edge     electronica seems to have rediscovered its sense of humor while overcoming its love/hate relationship with     the club scene.  But don't worry your pretty little head about the boys of Fridge, as they've already moved     on to more electronic and experimental pastures with last year's <i>Happiness</i>.  So while <i>EPH</i> doesn't quite cause the ripples it might've caused back in '99, the record still nobly stands as pivot of     Fridge's musical development.  Too bad it may have been kept in the cryogenic containment unit just a     smidge too long.</p></div>"|3199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3199-eph-reissue/|6.8|Rob Mitchum

    guitar for the now-legendary Dischord outfit Nation of Ulysses. After having
    his fill of D.C. hardcore, Green moved his skinny ass to San Francisco, met
    a couple of dyed-in-the-wool metalheads (one with actual long hair), and
    formed the Champs, an instrumental metal trio (later-modified to the more
    popular naughty name, The Fucking Champs). It was these Fucking Champs who
    would be heralded for the purest metal fervor.</p><p>
    
    Little did the heralders know, but behind guitar number two stood a
    total wuss. For alas, Green, fucking champion of metal, masqueraded as
    Concentrick, a fucking champion of ""lucid dreaming"". I know what you're
    thinking: ""Pussy."" Had these ""lucid dreams"" been revolting nightmares,
    Green might still be in business. But listening to Concentrick's third
    album, one realizes that they surely are not. They are sweet dreams--
    the product not of a metal rampage, but of a soothing lullaby.</p><p>
    
    Addressing the oft-cited metal inquiry, ""Do they kick ass?""-- well, not in
    the conventional sense, no.  Perhaps if you could construe meditation as
    ""kicking ass"" (as in ""man, that prayer circle <i>kicked ass</i>"") then
    <i>Lucid Dreaming</i> would kick ass.  But better adjectives exist for
    this, Green's ambient electronic alter-ego. Like these adjectives, for
    example: droning, palliative, supple, futuristic, sedate, assuaging,
    mellifluous, elysian, balmy, resplendent.  All in a Buck Rodgers sort of
    way.</p><p>
    
    Strings and a Mellotron get the album kicking on ""Lucid Moments"".
    Imagine if Buck Rodgers had his own romantic chamber orchestra, and
    you have the idea exactly. ""Behind the Trees"" takes Buck out of his cozy
    space cabin and finds him wandering a spooky, uncharted space planet,
    replete with big orange boulders, space trees, and an atmosphere of pure
    cyanide gas. Buck would feel anxious, yes? So will you.</p><p>
    
    ""Secret in the Shallows and the Sky"" plays like the steel drum band at
    a tropical island space-resort for Buck and his friends (like the
    totally hot Wilma Deering, aka the Ricker's dad's girlfriend on
    ""Silver Spoons"", aka Erin Gray). They take Buck to new, soothing
    adventures in his mind, as waves of liquid nitrogen splash up against
    his rocket-fueled titanium catamaran.</p><p>
    
    ""Somnambulant"" sounds like you might reckon if your vocabulary is big
    enough. ""Soft Place"" keeps with the accurate descriptive naming trend,
    providing a downy-soft place for your ears. This soft place might be
    particularly welcome for burnt-out Champs fans. It drones like a coma.</p><p>
    
    Concentrick evokes strange comparisons, but this does not alter the
    fact that Green's effort here is pretty damn super. A delightful mix of
    sleepy ambient elements with a futuristic touch. Relax to it, fall
    asleep to it, or fantasize about Wilma Deering to it. The choice is

    album that isn't immediately equated with new wave forbears-- unless, of course, they're a garage rock band.
    I'm as guilty of this as the next person, but pigeonholing Washington. DC's Dame Fate in a musical niche
    roughly halfway between The Pretenders and Siouxsie and the Banshees, not only does the listener a disservice,
    but the band as well.</p><p>
<i>Time and Tide Wait for No Man</i> isn't bad as far as debut albums go.  Solid and cohesive, it lacks the
    sort of self-indulgence and well-intentioned (if poorly executed) attempts at conveying morbid insanity I've
    come to associate with melancholy indie rock records.  And despite its candy-colored album cover, Dame Fate
    strive to be thoughtful, mature soundtrack artists for listeners suffering from post-breakup stress or
    looking for something soothing yet hip to put on the stereo when the party's over. That this particular
    sound is partially the creation of guitarist Melissa Farris (formerly of Tuscadero), whose previous
    contributions to the musical landscape sounded anything but tempered and mature, is something of an oddity.
    But everyone has to grow up, right? And Farris's clever guitar work is the greatest single pleasure afforded
    this album.</p><p>
    
    The first track, ""Crisp Winter"", is promising. The spare, chiming guitars of the opening bars continually
    fade in and out over a fuzzy four-chord verse. The song is about two minutes too long, but a sympathetic
    listener could likely forgive the time lapse if its other elements didn't conspire to be catatonia-inducing.
    And that may be the point, as most of the songs on <i>Time and Tide</i>  follow the same basic format as
    the first to the point of numbing redundancy. After about 3.5 songs, it becomes remarkably easy to predict,
    down to the millisecond, the moment at which the jarring crunch will strike.</p><p>
    
    The best moments on <i>Time and Tide</i> are hidden away within individual tracks. ""River Letters"" shifts
    into subtle pop about halfway through the song; and the bombastic, clanging guitar on ""Stealing Hearts""
    temporarily transforms Dame Fate into a swaggering rock band.  Expanding on these elements, or adding more
    of them, would drastically improve Dame Fate's replay value.</p><p>
    
    From most reports I've heard, Dame Fate's atmospheric tendencies come off hitchless when they play live, so
    I'm willing to chalk some of this up to production. But I doubt even the greatest studio engineers could
    patch up the rhythm section.  Farris's guitar work is so much more adept than that of her bandmates that
    it genuinely frustrates.  The fabric is stretched pretty thin; you almost feel Farris pulling back as the
    other members struggle to keep up.  I could be somewhat sympathetic to this if <i>Time and Tide Wait for
    No Man</i> showed promise of a more consistent sort.  As it is, I'm mostly bored and underwhelmed.</p></div>"|2152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2152-time-and-tide-wait-for-no-man/|5.9|Alison Fields

While the idea of watching one pale face     illuminated by the glow of a Mac notebook is a little sad, a triumvirate of techie geeks in a club sitting     shoulder-to-shoulder and clicking like mad is downright pathetic.  It's like paying for the privilege of     watching a web design startup code HTML.</p><p>Fortunately, you can put this unsavory image out of your mind when listening to the second live collaboration     between Christian Fennesz, Jim O'Rourke and Peter Rehberg (aka Pita). The fact that <em>The Return of FennO'Berg</em> was     constructed live on some stage while a roomful of people with a drink in their hands watched these guys at     their computers has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you'll enjoy the CD. This here is audio,     folks, and on <em>The Return of FennO'Berg</em>, these three opt for the subtle, let the tracks build and     develop at an organic pace, and allow for the intrusion of the unexpected.</p><p>The ultimate doubletake on the first collaboration comes during ""Fenn O'Berg Theme"" when John Barry's score     to <em>Moonraker</em> struggled to free itself from the clutches of the laptop clatter. A similarly inspired     track here is ""A Viennese Tragedy"". While two CPU jockeys stay busy chopping up Mac-processed fragments of     static, bits of orchestral music keep popping out of the primordial stew.  Finally, a long section of     sweeping, romantic orchestral music is released, serving as a perfect contrast to the scattering noise.     The few minutes when the strings soar above the scraping sounds of industry is just so goddamn beautiful,     reminding me once again why Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s tape-heavy first album is far and away my favorite     thing they've done. Time collapses completely as the track plays, and ""A Viennese Tragedy"" becomes a fluid     mass of dark energy that could have come from anywhere.</p>
<p>Nothing else on <em>The Return of FennO'Berg</em> quite approaches ""A Viennese Tragedy"" for me, but the record     is still filled with great moments, and one-ups the first installment in terms of drama and overall     listenability. ""Riding Again"" is a quivering, Vaseline-lensed pan across the lounge music graveyard,     and the sound of warbling vibes and randomly firing organs dying a slow death reminds me a little of a     noisier take on some of Fennesz' <em>Endless Summer</em> material. ""We Will Diffuse You"" ends the album on     a high note when, after several minutes of a slowly gurgling bass riff, some incredibly lush guitar drones     take over-- the bass anchor throb is enough to massage your solar plexus, while the soft brush of the     harmonics whisper softly in your ear. Only ""Floating My Boat""-- at 5\xBD minutes the shortest of these four     tracks by some distance-- is less than good.</p>
<p>I've no idea what it was like to watch this go down in person (and who knows what it actually sounded like--     the sleeve mentions six months of editing that takes place in two cities), but there is no question that     this little aluminum disc is brimming with pleasant surprises.</p></div>"|3031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3031-the-return-of-fenn-oberg/|8.0|Mark Richardson

On the strength of three
    independently released albums, she has developed a strong cult following, and a number of influential critics
    have warmed up to her. Plus, she has some pretty cool admirers (like Lou Barlow, for one) and has made guest
    appearances for such hipsters as Dntel and Beachwood Sparks. Her songs, of course, aren't your standard major
    label fare: some of them have fairly complicated (if not overly pretentious) lyrical conceits. But her voice
    is such a distinctive instrument, able to both soar dramatically and evoke intimacy, that most listeners
    probably won't even think twice about the words she sings.</p><p>
    
    It's also makes sense that Columbia would hire a guy like Mitchell Froom to produce Todd. With an extensive
    resume that includes Richard Thompson, David Byrne, and Elvis Costello, he's the majors' producer-of-choice
    when they need a singer/songwriter type polished up a bit for mass consumption-- though he has a tendency to
    overdo it sometimes (a few Richard Thompson albums spring to mind).  Seeing the Columbia label on the spine
    of <i>The Golden State</i>, Mia Doi Todd's major label debut, you can almost hear the board meeting that
    must've taken place to discuss her Beth Orton/Aimee Mann-like crossover potential. And, that too makes sense
    and is easily imagined.</p><p>
    
    Sadly (for me, at least), it also makes sense why they'd choose to re-record Todd's older material for her
    major label debut. There are a lot of good songs on those albums, so it's hard to go too terribly wrong. But
    to someone who's been buying her albums all along, it sure seems like a cop out.  I, for one, would have
    liked to have seen more new material, especially in light of her recent collaborations with the above-mentioned
    artists. Instead, <i>The Golden State</i> offers updated versions of songs from all three of her previous
    albums.</p><p>
    
    The danger with this approach, of course, is screwing up the old versions with heavy-handed production or
    uncomplimentary instrumentation. By and large though, Todd and Froom have avoided this. The ten-song album
    is top-heavy with the more spiffed-up songs, as you might expect, and the more bare-bone tracks comprise the
    second half.  ""88 Ways"" and ""Digital"", for example, open the album in bad fashion.  And though they do happen
    to be the most embellished songs here, it's not overproduction that kills them; they're just bad songs.
    Filled with postmodern catchwords like ""entropy"" and ""binary"", the self-serious and pseudo-intellectual
    lyrics prepare these tracks for certain inclusion on the soundtrack to the next Keanu Reeves cyberflick.</p><p>
    
    ""Independence Day"", however, turns it around with a rendition subtly shifted from the original, with distant
    keys underscoring the song's already sinister tension. Another highlight is ""Autumn"", which first appeared
    on Todd's debut album, <i>The Ewe and the Eye</i>. Here it's given a more upbeat and carefree reading
    befitting its theme of breaking free from a failing relationship.  Stripping the accompaniment down to just
    voice and guitar on a song about escaping into fantasy in the face of sexual guilt, ""Poppy Fields"" brings
    Todd back to the kind of material on which she built her reputation: her finger-picked guitar speeds faster
    and faster toward the end of the song, and she stumbles as she repeats, ""another world, another world""--
    it's both disorientating and claustrophobic.</p><p>
    
    It's probably a smart move for Columbia to release a reconfigured sampler of her early songs to catch people
    up on her talent. Yet, as an ardent fan, it's hard for me not to feel a little let down. When I got my hands
    on <i>The Golden State</i>, I was genuinely excited to see how Todd had developed as a songwriter since her
    last album. Sadly, she hasn't developed at all. In fact, come to think of it, she hasn't really developed
    that much since her debut. All her albums so far, despite their merits, have been more or less interchangeable,
    both in mood and maturity. Hopefully, with this ""best of"" behind her, she will be unburdened of her past and
    free to grow into the songwriter she's shown signs of becoming.</p></div>"|8091.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8091-the-golden-state/|7.0|Jason Nickey

    that'll be playing in the background.  It'll be one of those life-changing moments of introspection where
    everything goes slo-mo as the first-person camera pans slowly around, pausing on the faces of all the patrons
    in their powder-blue jumpsuits.  You'll see their vacuous smiles, but their sad eyes will betray how hollow
    and unhappy they really are.  ""Hey,"" you'll think, ""I'm not gonna be like these soulless robots; I'm through
    with stolen credit cards and oxygen bars-- I'm gonna <i>make something outta my life!</i>""  Seriously, it'll
    be way touching; life-affirming, even.  And the song that'll be backing this futuristic moment of clarity
    will be the sterling space-gospel of Polara's ""Jetpack Blues"".</p><p>
    
    Spacy but heartfelt vocal effects, choir-like chorus, and reverb-drenched guitar atmospherics that would
    make The Edge sweat(ier) form a song more easily described with ridiculous Gernsback-infused vignettes than
    actual descriptors.  The rest of <i>Jetpack Blues</i> never quite measures up to the title track, but that
    one alone will nearly justify the $13 sticker on this digipak'd CD.  The remainder of Polara's latest seems
    content to rest on its laurels, offering solid but slightly generic rock.  The six-stringers bite off giant
    hunks of <i>Achtung Baby</i> with the occasional blues riff worming its way into the rush, while the
    electronics and effects are nothing but ray-guns, hovercrafts, and chrome.</p><p>
    
    If it were all that rosy, of course, this would be a stellar album, but after about five tracks of the same
    formulaic arrangements (excepting ""Jetpack Blues"", which is unique among the rest) it becomes clear that the
    future might not be quite as bright as it seems.  Individually, these songs are solid, uptempo kernels of
    sci-fi sounds, but the non-stop effects-peddling that's genuinely refreshing for one track starts to suck
    the soul out of the album before long.  The result is that the songs begin to blend together into what might
    as well be a single (albeit damn fine) forty-minute epic.  Eventually, a numbing stillness sets in and the
    album passes overhead.</p><p>
    
    That numbness remains until the last actual song on the album, ""The Story So Far"", a stripped-down number
    notable primarily for breaking the pace.  Polara excels at sweeping, large-scale rock, and this track, if
    nothing else, makes it clear that they should stick to that.  In particular, ""The Story So Far"" falls prey
    to the one other real flaw of <i>Jetpack Blues</i>, in that frontman Ed Ackerson's vocals are as often
    achingly cheesy as they are sincere.  It's not much trouble on the grand scale of most of these tracks,
    but it does gets cloying on a more intimate cut like this one.</p><p>
    
    This is all nitpicking, though.  While a lot of <i>Jetpack Blues</i> might be unremarkable, it's still
    insanely fun at points.  The massive opener, ""Can't Get Over You"", is the perfect track to pop in the tape
    deck just before you break the landspeed record (in sort of a good, Lance Armstrong, achievement way, as
    opposed to a bad, Vin Diesel, crappy-blockbuster way).  And even if you don't plan on breaking the sound
    barrier anytime soon (loser), supersonic speeds are unnecessary to enjoy the hilariously titled ""Wig On"",
    which briefly reaches up from the mid-album lull to arrest your attention with Jennifer Jurgen's gorgeous
    backing vocals.  The irony, really, is that Polara attempts to evoke oddly futuristic qualities through a
    synthesis of mild electronics while the music underneath owes everything to the guitar-heavy rock of almost
    two decades ago.  Of course, that's not a bad thing; it just doesn't sound current is all.  But if nothing
    else, when this kind of stuff has its renaissance fifteen years from now, your kids'll love it.</p></div>"|6367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6367-jetpack-blues/|7.5|Eric Carr

    to create a whole new subspecies of rock?  Obviously: you start a funk and dance band inspired by the
    early work of the B-52's.  Hey, why not?  That's what Ethan Buckler did.  After <i>Tweez</i> sent kids to
    dust off their metronomes in '89, Buckler split with math-rock progenitors Slint to search for a simpler
    groove. And when he found it, he stayed with it.</p><p>
    
    It's been ten years since King Kong's debut album, <i>Old Man on the Bridge</i>, and frankly, things haven't
    changed much, if at all, for the band.  Of course, by now, it seems that if things were to change much at
    all, it would undermine the whole point of this group, which is to overcome you with basic beats, even
    basic-er basslines (we're talking three notes max), borderline moronic lyrics, a voice that sounds like
    David Berman's straight man, and above all, repetition, repetition, repetition. Hell, changing the formula
    now would just dilute it. And the thing is, it sometimes really works.</p><p>
    
    Sometimes.  The biggest problem facing this band is Buckler's ridiculous storylines, which have a tendency
    to wind on long after the initial novelty of his silliness wears thin.  And after that, you're still left
    with half an album to get through. He seems like one of those people who gets an idea and carries it to its
    absurd end, no matter how ridiculous it may appear to outsiders.  Thus: 1995's caveman-inspired <i>Me
    Hungry</i> and 1994's rural-life concept piece, <i>Funny Farm</i>.</p><p>
    
    The theme this time is space, sorta.  You see, <i>The Big Bang</i> is about a man who gets fed up with the
    human race, decides to leave Earth via rocketship, and then happens to stumble upon a paradise planet (the
    planet of Kong) which declares him King (<i>geddit?</i>). It ends in a natal flashback sequence (""Life"")
    just like in Kubrick's <i>2001</i>, wherein we learn that the whole album is a big allegory for-- you
    guessed it-- life itself.  Awesome.</p><p>
    
    With the setting being space and all, you'd expect to hear plenty of ""Zaxxon""-sounding effects here, and the
    Kong (with the help of producer Neil Michael Hagerty, seemingly Drag City's answer to Thrill Jockey's John
    McEntire of late) does not disappoint on that account: lasers, tazers and long-fading phasers.  Yet there's
    also a breezy, tropical feel to the album, in a Haircut 100 sort of way, with wooden vibes and congas, and
    guitar riffs so rigid they're mecha-funky.</p><p>
    
    It's with the nine-minute album ""Deep Blue Sky"" (incidentally the best song on the album) that we learn of
    the protagonist's beef with people: ""It's the humanity/ Crawling all over the place/ It's the humanity/ Taking
    up so much space/ Kissing each other's asses/ You've got such bad taste/ I piss on you/ And the whole human
    race.""  Don't take this too seriously, though. It's meant to be goofy and unsophisticated. But not. Think of
    it like a Ween record: a children's album for adults.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>The Big Bang</i> is decent but forgettable, which puts it on par with King Kong's other
    releases.  All of them have one, maybe two standout moments where the matter-of-fact absurdisms mesh with
    the remedial funk-rock to create something so primordial that it becomes temporarily compelling.  Still,
    nobody needs two King Kongs records, and though this is no better or worse than the others, it's not worth
    picking up if you've already met the requirements.</p></div>"|4444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4444-the-big-bang/|6.2|Jason Nickey

Indie guitar godhead Doug Martsch, having grown tired of the fast-paced corporate Idaho
    lifestyle, has relocated to the backwoods of Lou'sana (or Mizzou, depending on your sources), and
    decided to re-learn his chosen instrument from scratch.  To accomplish this feat, he has studied
    under a succession of colorfully nicknamed Delta bluesman like ""No-Toes"" Willie Green and ""Hodag""
    Rufus Dillingham.  Martsch was last seen wearing denim overalls and a straw hat, sitting on a log
    in an undisclosed swampy location, plucking on a banjo with a half-empty jug marked ""XXX"" resting
    by his side.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, Doug Martsch has made his blues album.  Since 1993, Martsch has been kicking out poptastic
    classic rock with his full-time unit Built to Spill, crafting crazily infectious hooks and ripping
    Malmsteen solos that'd fit nicely between The Who and Styx on your local oldster-demographic FM
    stop.  In accordance with this image, it should surprise no one that Martsch has made this record--
    the solo blues album is a textbook 70s move.  So, those of you who've been waving those DOUG MARTSCH
    IS THE NEW CLAPTON signs for the last ten years can finally take your bow.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, <i>Now You Know</i> is a different brand of blues homagery from Clapton's <i>From the
    Cradle</i>; this isn't your usual 12-bar cookie-cutter ""my baby done me wrong"" pretend-mourning.
    Instead, Martsch test-drives a Delta blues sound-- a style closer to the point in musical evolution
    where country/western and blues went their separate, segregated ways.  His weary rasp is minimally
    accompanied.  For the most part, we're offered only acoustic guitar, on which Martsch delivers
    beer-bottle slides and gooey bends played dirty enough to draw a clatter-rattle from the occasional
    string section.  Drums?  Sometimes, but always kept unobtrusively distant in the mix.  Electric
    guitar?  A few times in the record's second half, and sparsely implemented even then.  In short, this
    record is about as intimate an impression as we're likely to get of Martsch outside of the short tour
    he's launching in support of it.</p><p>
    
    The music, of course, is strictly Blooze for Dummies-- or in this case, indie rockers-- and thus is probably
    best dealt with through comparison to the Built to Spill catalog.  Through that lens, Martsch continues the
    sub-greatness trend of his recent work, releasing another record that fails to carry the weight of the
    canonical two-fer that lies at the center of his career.  The blues outfit switches off and on from gimmick
    status (the thematically and sonically overweight ""Woke Up This Morning With My Mind on Jesus"") to clever
    twist, but never seems to be the thesis statement of the album.  Nearly every track begins with bluesy
    intentions, but only a handful (the pace-setter ""Offer"", and the gritty faux-field recording ""Stay"")
    stick with that dynamic for their duration.</p><p>
    
    Instead, the fretboard whines mostly serve as a contrast tool for segments that sound like, well,
    stripped-down acoustic Built to Spill-- and not just because Martsch's double-tracked nose-singing is
    too easily identifiable to allow for a complete departure.  Witness the smooth segue from the almost
    bluegrassy hoedown finger-picking of ""Window"" into a more poppy electric segment a la ""Time Trap""; or
    the Casio bubbling under the Delta-flavored first movement of ""Lift"" before it implodes into gentle
    <i>There's Nothing Wrong with Love</i>-style pop.</p><p>
    
    But hell, who's to bitch about Doug doing solo BTS-type stuff?  Anyone who's heard the beautifully aching
    b-side loner version of ""Kicked It in the Sun"" can attest that it's Martsch's songs and delivery, not the
    raging guitars and drumkit, that gives the band's music its gladiatorial impact.  And sure enough, the more
    familiar-sounding material is what really sticks amongst these eleven tracks.  ""Heart (Things Never Shared)""
    is a haunting, drumless rumination spiked with Mellotron orchestra and plunky vibraphone, while the double
    guitar slides of the instrumental ""Instrumental"" (straight shooter, that Doug) is a more rugged interpretation
    of recent BTS fare.  Most impressive, though, is ""Impossible"", the first Martsch composition in years to
    give me that <i>Perfect From Now On</i> feeling, partially due to the cello accompaniment (why did he ever
    stop using that cello?), but mostly because of its slow build through multiple movements into cathartic,
    majestic guitar wank.</p><p>
    
    So what do we now know from <i>Now You Know</i>?  Well, as is the norm for the publicity-shy Martsch, very
    little.  Only Doug would release an experiment with new influences as the first record under his Christian
    name (not to mention that he admits picking up said influences only recently).  But judging from the album's
    tendency to lapse into traditionally Spill-ish moments, even Doug realizes that the restrictive nature of
    the blues isn't the Southern faith healer he needs to shake off his creative rut.  As a result, <i>Now You

Why, last time I
    came down to call on my half-cousin Zeke he held up dinner for three hours
    waiting on ol' Mindy Sue, who was supposed to bring over a big sack of onions
    but got caught up in fixing the compost shed, seeing as the shed man couldn't
    make it because he was getting his hammock extended that day and the hammock
    man was stuck in a tractor jam on Route 20...</p><p>
    
    Ahem.  'Scuse me.  See, I've never actually been to Anacortes.  It's probably
    a very nice place to raise a family or own a boat.  But, suffice to say, a
    tiny Washington port town doesn't seem to be the sort of place that could
    support any sort of music scene.  Against all odds, however, a pretty formidable
    one seems to be thriving there, based mostly on the talent and industry of The
    Microphones' Phil Elvrum and the patronage of Beat Happening alum Bret Lunsford,
    who runs both an indie record shop called The Business, and the Knw-Yr-Own label
    which teethed The Microphones and handles the other Anacortesian bands' releases.
    And of course, when he's not lending from his banks of indie cred, Lunsford also
    gives back to the community as principal member of D+.</p><p>
    
    With Elvrum and singer/songwriter/Microphones-song-title-referent Karl Blau
    backing him up, Lunsford's band has the makings of a gen-u-wine twee powerhouse.
    Lunsford, however, also likes to take his time.  D+'s last album, <i>Dandelion
    Seeds</i>, came out back in 1998, and he's been silent ever since.  In the ten
    years since Beat Happening called it quits, Lunsford hasn't strayed much from
    his previous band's pop-rock primitivism, either.  If anything, D+ takes the
    concept even farther; where Beat Happening was plain, D+ is downright homely.
    Lunsford's back-of-the-throat Muppet croak doesn't quite have the same charm as
    Calvin Johnson's wide-eyed baritone, and <i>Dandelion Seeds</i> attempted to get
    by mainly on its lazy, clumsy naivete, to mixed results.</p><p>
<i>Mistake</i>'s eponymous opener injects some much-needed energy into things--
    Elvrum lays out a skittery, metronomic beat behind Lunsford's Luddite growly
    rant about how his TV is stealing all of his friends.  The song actually
    manages to maintain a menacing atmosphere with surprising efficiency-- a few
    abrupt stops, some intermittent feedback drones, and Blau's deep harmonizing
    on the chorus give bite to what might have otherwise been a goof.  Unfortunately,
    D+ hasn't quite gotten the hang of intensity yet; ""God Above God"", while
    attempting a brooding shamble, just kind of plods, and the religious message
    collapses under its own weight.</p><p>
    
    But it's the lazy love-pop stuff that D+ have finally, gratifyingly, figured out.
    ""Megadose"" fortifies Lunsford's shaky tenor with a wall of 'Phones-y harmony on
    the choruses, and ""What's Not to Fall in Love With"" elaborates along the same
    lines, spinning  out a shaky, sad, breeze-thin and bleary melodic web.  In the
    bluntly affectionate ""You're So Right"", the great lines that Lunsford scatters
    throughout his songs finally cohere into a brilliant closing: ""Run away from who
    I know I am/ Jump into someone that I can't swim/ Plant my kisses on another face/
    They don't grow the way they do on you"".  ""Take You For Granted"", however, beats
    them all-- Lunsford's tuneless a capella recitation suddenly turns into a graceful
    ode, layered with cellos, ringing guitars, and gauzy vocal harmonies.</p><p>
    
    As much as D+ seems to be gaining momentum on <i>Mistake</i>, the band is still
    all about inertia of the negative kind-- Lunsford's lyrical landscape teems
    with dying stars and stalling cars.  And seeing as these eight songs are just
    about all he's released in the past four years, he seems to be something of
    an expert on the matter.  But if Lunsford has, in fact, run out of steam,
    <i>Mistake</i> at least provides an evocation of the sort of rural decay that
    can debilitate (or drive) a scene.  And it'll probably pay for that hammock
    extension, too.</p></div>"|2121.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2121-mistake/|7.1|Brendan Reid

Does
    Dillinja have what it takes to dethrone the samurai math beatster as the ruler of ""Ninja Gaiden""? And if
    they all broke out the Sega Master System while fiddling with their laptops, just what the hell would it
    sound like?  Why, it would most likely sound like <i>'96 Drum N Bass Classixxx</i>, you silly thing. Or
    at least, that's the scenario Raczynski has in mind, judging from this twelve-track assault of freaked-out,
    8-bit, Polish-cum-Japanese rip-ups.</p><p>
    
    Though described on his website as a collection of old-skool underground d'n'b rollers mixed by ""DJ Bogdan
    Raczynski"", what we really have here are twelve alter egos burying their teeth into said genre, mashing it
    between molars and bicuspids and spitting it all over the dance floor.  It's a love-note from Raczynski to
    the likes of Omni Trio and the Metalheadz Krew, a fusing of the former's adrenalized drill-n-bass bounce
    with the latter's pioneering sound(s).</p><p>
    
    After a brief digression into the wispy, acoustic/electronic music sound so popular with critics five seconds
    ago, Raczynski has returned to the fertile stomping grounds of his more beat-heavy material, ranging from the
    ballistic ass-shaking of <i>Thinking of You</i>'s ""Unsatisfied Customer"" to pre-Rephlex mashers like ""30002389""--
    caffeinated breaks and improbably deep bass tones that would send the balls of any raver right up into the
    secret pocket of their scratch-n-sniff UFOs. ""Battle Zone 1996"" alone is worth the price of admission to the
    party, its dark cut-ups and mighty bassline delivering on its promise to ""put the girls in heat"".  Believe
    me, when that first bass tone rattles the window frame, there's gonna be a flood.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Raczynski drops a bomb under the guise of Agent 30 with ""5L45H! 4TT4CK! 3NT3R K3Y"", which pits a
    fuzzed-out, descending arpeggio against bum-rushing snare rolls before breaking into music from some lost
    level of ""Mega Man"".  And ""D&amp;D; Diabolical"" covers similar territory, rocking some raga breaks and bringing
    back the philosophizing narrator from his first album, <i>Boku Mo Warakan</i>.</p><p>
<i>Classixxx</i> is far from the serious affair that was 2000's <i>My Love I Love</i>, allowing Raczynski
    to hang loose and break new ground in a genre time forgot.  Witness the liquid flow of ""Governor's Banquet"",
    the ease with which Amen breaks slide into mad drill-n-bass tempos before returning to their original,
    blunted course. This stuff is far too insane for your average jungle fan, to be sure-- any who dared to
    take a ride on a merry-go-round like ""Pouch Fulla Seed (Hard on You RMX)"" would find their ass face-down on
    the playground asphalt in seconds.  But those into the scarier aspects of electronic weirdness, who like
    their music abstract with rampant unpredictability and personality, will be indiscriminately beat down by
    Bogdan's badassery.</p><p>

    new song every day on a beat-up four-track; absorbing Harry Smith's <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i>
    and old school hip-hop with equal enthusiasm. The aptly titled ""Loser"", his biggest and most career-defining
    hit, was recorded in a friend's living room for kicks. His first live performances were on hijacked mics at
    other peoples' gigs: he'd just step up with a guitar or harmonica between acts and entertain while the often
    bemused next band set up their drums. On the homemade tapes and scrapped-together compilations that comprised
    his earliest recorded output, Beck cobbled together all of his influences-- noise, hardcore, country, rap,
    folk, grunge, R&amp;B;, found sound and classic rock-- and melded it into his own junkyard punk.</p><p>
    
    Over subsequent releases Beck continued to refine the art of juxtaposing achingly poignant folk songs with
    lo-fi guitar freakouts, collages of dialogue and noise, and Radio Shack hip-hop. With <i>Odelay</i> he
    managed to pull all of these disparate elements together in an artful way, blending nimble dobro guitar
    figures, say, with sample-heavy backbeats, vocal samples, banjo, a loop of Van Morrison covering Bob Dylan--
    bottles and cans, or just clap your hands.  At live shows, or on Chris Douridas' morning program at KCRW,
    Beck would often play never-recorded songs he'd likely composed just a few days before playing them,
    exquisitely voiced and effortlessly brilliant.</p><p>
    
    What happened to that guy?</p><p>
<i>Mutations</i>, the genteel quickie Beck recorded on the cheap in 1998, was largely a knee-jerk reaction
    to the daunting task of ever having to follow up <i>Odelay</i> at all. His label even reneged on a provision
    that allowed him to release records on independents, and it's little wonder: with <i>Mutations</i>, shit-hot
    producer Nigel Godrich had crafted a slick, almost clinically glossy record, with clean guitars that never
    buzzed or hit bum notes.  And while ""Cold Brains"", ""Nobody's Fault But My Own"", and ""Canceled Check"" are
    great songs, lesser tracks like ""Lazy Flies"" and ""We Live Again"" were shamelessly gussied-up with tired
    space-rock bleeps and whooshes-- and I won't even get into the made-for-Starbucks faux-exotica of
    ""Tropicalia"". No offense to Pitchfork alum Neil Lieberman, who praised the album mellifluously, but in
    2002 we're up to our asses in ""futuristic roots albums"". Let's call <i>Mutations</i> what it was: a
    soft-rock <i>One Foot in the Grave</i> made with Pro Tools and a heart of steel.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps it's telling that his seventh studio album is titled <i>Sea Change</i>-- for rather than the smooth,
    utterly inoffensive quirks of <i>Mutations</i>, Beck opts for abrupt changes in temperament and lush
    instrumentation. Recording again with Godrich and his regular band (Smokey Hormel, Roger Manning, Joey
    Waronker, and Justin Meldal-Johnsen) pounding out a track a day over an intense two-week period, <i>Sea
    Change</i> rightfully feels like a sequel to <i>Mutations</i> with no alarms and no surprises. In fact,
    opener, ""The Golden Age"", would feel right at home on <i>Mutations</i> itself, with its gentle mid-tempo
    strumming, lonesome wails of pedal steel and predictable space-rock flourishes.</p><p>
    
    A cloud of mind-numbing melancholy hangs over <i>Sea Change</i>, from the world-weary grandpa-Beck voice he
    employs on most of the tracks to its unfailingly morose lyrics. ""These days I barely get by/ I don't even
    try,"" Beck sings in ""The Golden Age"", and that's just the tip of the jagged iceberg that looms ever larger
    in <i>Sea Change</i>'s periscope. It's obvious just from perusing the song titles-- ""Lonesome Tears,"" ""End
    of the Day,"" ""Already Dead,"" ""Lost Cause""-- that the 2002 model Beck is one sad sack (and it's impossible
    not to armchair quarterback which of Beck's celebrity girlfriends inspired such gut-wrenching bile). But
    though the songs are jam-packed with typical Beck imagery (stray dogs, moonlight drives, diamonds as
    kaleidoscopes) there's very little here that measures up to the eloquence of ""She is all, and everything
    else is small.""</p><p>
    
    It's pretty obvious what Beck is shooting for with <i>Sea Change</i>: that timeless quality that his heroes
    Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan and Nick Drake seemed to exude with every recording. But here, as on
    <i>Mutations</i>, he confuses lyrical simplicity and standard-tuning, key-of-C songwriting with the
    unpretentious directness of his idols. Too often Beck saddles these songs with half-baked cliches and easy
    rhymes: ""sky"" always rhymes with ""die"", ""care"" always rhymes with ""there"". He doesn't even sound like
    himself on many of <i>Sea Change</i>'s more paint-by-numbers cuts. On ""Guess I'm Doing Fine"" Beck emotes
    in an unnatural croak that's likely the product of a digitally decelerated vocal track, but he mostly just
    sounds constipated. Likewise with the karaoke-honed Gordon Lightfoot impression Beck turns in on the hoary
    ""End of the Day"": ""It's nothing that I haven't seen before/ But it still kills me like it did before.""</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Beck mines <i>Mutations</i>' folky space-rock vibe with more artful and ear-pleasing results.
    The chiming guitars and groaning strings of ""Lost Cause"" creak and sway like the tired masts of a pirate
    ship; washes of backward sound snake through the melody like restless ghosts. ""The Golden Age"", with its
    chorus of tinkling glockenspiels and cavernous echo, is a pleasant diversion in the vein of <i>Mutations</i>'
    ""Cold Brains."" An unnecessary remake of 1994's ""It's All In Your Mind"" is tarted up with the omnipresent
    synth blips and drums, but some tastefully distant banjo licks and Suzie Katayama's swooning cello lend the
    song a resigned majesty the original certainly never portended.</p><p>
    
    But it's <i>Sea Change</i>'s most daring tracks that are ultimately its most satisfying. Beck's father,
    David Campbell, contributes inventive string arrangements to three cuts: ""Paper Tiger"" is a low-key triumph,
    with a minimal bed of bass and drums punched up by sudden, deep string attacks-- Beck's ""Glass Onion,"" if
    you will; the deliciously overwrought ""Lonesome Tears"" is an uncomfortably raw display of emotion, with an
    unpredictable melody and unbelievably tortured chorus (""How could this love, ever-turning/ Never turn its
    eye on me?"" Beck questions as the song builds to a cathartic tsunami of violins and ear-splitting noise);
    the moody, cinematic ""Round the Bend"" cribs the cadence and nocturnal vibe of Nick Drake's ""River Man"",
    augmented by plucky upright bass and Beck's subdued, almost intentionally slurred vocal.</p><p>
    
    But Cap'n Beck saves his strangest songs for the second half of the album, with the enigmatic ""Sunday Sun""
    bathing odd, disjointed lyrics (""Jealous minds walk in a line, and their faces jade the strain"") in a Brian
    Wilson-inspired glow, with mixed but cosmetically acceptable results. The unsettling sea shanty ""Little One""
    is a return to form, with a fetching minor-chord hook and creepy lyrics (""Cold bones tied together by black
    ropes we pulled from a swing"") intoned in a convincing Kurt Cobain growl.</p><p>
    
    He knots it all together, sorta, with the anticlimactic closer ""Side of the Road"", which plods along
    awkwardly amid busy slide-guitar work and a rambling electric piano. It's a far cry from the back-porch
    perfection of ""Ramshackle"", but given what it reveals, it'll do. ""Something better than this, someplace
    I'd like to go,"" sings Beck in a tremulous voice seemingly decades beyond his 32 years. ""To let all I've
    learned tell me what I know/ About the kind of life I never thought I'd live.""</p><p>
    
    On <i>Sea Change</i>, Beck sounds intentionally world-weary, but it's the songs themselves that sound
    labored. Is it no longer enough for Beck to write profound, genre-bending tunes that stand on their own?
    Does he really need the crutch of suffocating overproduction and bold strokes of orchestration to shock us
    into caring again? Two turntables and a microphone, man!</p><p>
    
    'Cause there was a time when Beck didn't need Nigel Godrich to space out his white-collar blues. A winter
    spent in Calvin Johnson's basement, an afternoon spent with a beatbox and a slide guitar in a friend's
    living room was all he needed to pluck otherworldly songs from the fertile Beckscape of desolated views,
    crazy towns, lost causes and stolen boats.  Given how much soul-searching obviously went into this record,
    it's distressing how little soul the finished product actually has. If there's anything the self-absorbed
    murk of <i>Sea Change</i> illustrates with unmistakable clarity, it's that Beck has forgotten how to connect
    with his inner loser-- and it's nobody's fault but his own.</p></div>"|617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/617-sea-change/|6.9|Will Bryant

    <i>Low Light Dreams</i>, are nothing if not an adoring tribute to that band's <i>Polyfusia</i> and <i>Quique</i>
    LPs.  This album is gorgeous to space out to, and though it lacks the intricacy of Chessie's similarly inclined
    Plug Research release <i>Overnight</i>, its gauzy drones and rudimentary rhythm tracks do manage to effectively
    mimic lucid dreaming, underwater sunlight, and the atomic ballet of Brownian motion.</p><p>
    After you're washed with three-minutes of cotton-wool white noise entitled ""Light Fails Me"", Smith begins
    the guided tour of his crepuscular world.  With soothing waves of distortion and a bass drum simulating a
    heartbeat, ""Building Memories Without You"" borrows heavily from Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project.  Smith also
    pays homage to Björk with ""Grosse Strasse"", which is how I would imagine the opening strings of her sublime
    ""Unravel"" might sound if remixed by Main and Force Inc's Geoff White.</p><p>
    The delicately wavering drones and functional percussion of ""Detached Under Buildings"" turn bewitching when
    Smith plugs in his guitar. He repeats a simple three-chord phrase, beneath which he almost imperceptibly
    alters his drum machine's timbres. Elsewhere, ""Interior Dub"" is pure first-generation post-rock dub:
    occasional rimshots pepper a glistening synthline while Smith's bass slopes low to the ocean floor.  Then,
    emerging from this hypnogogic zone, Smith sings indistinguishable words which recall the textural station
    platform announcements of Aphex Twin's ""Tha"".</p><p>
    Though the title parodies a Spacemen 3 album, ""Dreaming About Making Music to Dream To"" is deceptively the
    clubbiest cut on the album.  Yet, for all its syncopated percussion, the immense washes of blissful white
    noise (and the eerie countermelody) may force even the most cranked-up non-stop-raver to join the wallflowers.
    ""Night Is Blurred"" goes for a similar deception, but this time Smith keeps the white noise more surreptitious
    in the mix and gives greater prominence to micropercussion and a downcast, indigent melody.  This track could
    be a ""Voodoo Ray"" or ""Pacific State"" for depressives.</p><p>
<i>Low Light Dreams</i> closes with ""Post Obsession"", Smith's first real display of uniqueness.  Subverting
    the derivative subterranean drift of the rest of the album, Smith allows dissonant chording and mechanical
    clanks to disrupt his serene drones. Though these sounds remind me of Seefeel-er Mark Clifford's Disjecta
    project, Smith unburdens himself of overt influence here, and, I sincerely hope, points to territories
    he'll explore on future outings.</p></div>"|7146.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7146-low-light-dreams/|6.6|Paul Cooper

    some inviting drones bathing it all in a phosphorescent glow of sound.  It's the kind of music that doesn't
    sound like it has much of a place to go, but you hardly care, as its company is just that pleasant.  And
    then, at about 3\xBD minutes, it begins to boil, rising up to a cacophonous, beautiful crescendo, comprised
    of noises that <i>might</i> be guitars.  And then, in a flash, it's gone, leaving you again to sit with the
    drones until another song comes along to take you somewhere else.</p><p>
    If Kinski's entire debut album (assuming you don't consider their 45-minute debut EP an album) were as good
    as that first track, I'd be grabbing you by your virtual collar, and shaking you from across the Internet,
    imploring you to buy, buy, buy and spread the gospel further.  As it stands, it's not, but some of it does
    manage to come very close.  The Seattle quartet has a great many strengths-- not least of which is their
    impressive musicianship, which rears its head everywhere while never descending to the depths of masturbatory
    self-indulgence.  And with seven tracks hovering in at just under an hour, that's just about miraculous.</p><p>
    Volume seems very important to the band's overall aesthetic, with several tracks featuring violent shifts
    in dynamics at key points.  ""One Ear in the Sun"" begins as a quiet meditation before erupting in a
    fuzz-encrusted blast smeared with electronic noise.  The similarities to Mogwai are obvious, though Kinski
    lack the subtlety and control that make Mogwai such a juggernaut. ""Daydream Intonation"" follows with a
    different approach, opening at a slow pace, and gradually ramping the tempo until the band is moving at
    a breakneck pace.  A brief breakdown launches them full force into a wild ending choked with noise, a
    semblance of melody coughing out from underneath it all.  ""That Helmut Poe Kid's Weird"" is a low point,
    though-- it's less contoured and more given to shapeless electronic noodling, and as such, some of the
    passion behind the playing gets obscured.</p><p>
    Thankfully, though, it's followed by another standout, ""Newport"".  Here, Kinski add vocals, courtesy of
    frontman Chris Martin (<i>not</i> the Coldplay guy, though I'm fairly certain he gets that a lot).  The
    track proves the band not just stellar noisemakers, but able songwriters as well.  Propelled by a furious
    assault from drummer Dave Weeks, Martin's delivery sounds far more alive than its deadpan tone might allow
    for in a different setting.</p><p>
    The high-octane approach of ""Newport"" and ""Daydream Intonation"" doesn't always work for the guys, though,
    as demonstrated on the mindlessly fuzzy ""New India"", which feels more like a casual jam than a thought-out
    song, and deals the record an early blow from which it thankfully recovers.  Appropriately, the album ends
    as a whisper, just as it began, with the quietly eddying ""Montgomery""-- a song that, while striking and
    powerful, doesn't quite match its album-opening counterpart.  Still, despite its faults, <i>Be Gentle with
    the Warm Turtle</i> ranks as a quite an achievement for a young band, succeeding where others in the often
    tiresome world of instrumental rock have failed.</p></div>"|4461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4461-be-gentle-with-the-warm-turtle/|7.8|Joe Tangari

This sound, heard in so many acidic shaman works, should be a     background element, like the quaint white noise on psychedelic Beatles     records or the woefully misplaced pan flutes in digital new age music.     It swirls disorientingly like a funnel cloud, panned across the mix.     The trick is not to think of this sound as a device of dissonance, or     worse, as something to initiate your high, but merely as something to     enhance what is already way out there.  Of course, it might help if you     were pretty far out, too.</p><p>Japan's acid-folk trio Floating Flower is far out as a matter of practice.     In fact, as you read this, Yuki and Kaneko Tetsuya are probably somewhere in     India or Nepal, tripping into nirvana, becoming one with a mountain or two,     and generally embodying all that is psychedelically true.  The third member,     Acid Mother Temple's Kawabata Makoto, is tying up all the loose ends: mixing     their records, releasing them on his label, trying to keep ""spongers"" out of     their house while they're away, though he's sure Yuki and Tetsuya don't care     how many CDs they sell (if any).  Floating Flower may one day make more     music, but no one really knows when the other two will return.</p><p>In the meantime, Black Plastic Sound's reissue of their first two albums     (originally on AMT) on one disc gives me the chance to hear the results of     their extended journeys into other planes.  Taking the classic sound of     traditional folk, adding Eastern percussion and strings, ghostly female     vocals, searing (but never heavy) electric guitar solos, and the dreaded     tunneling, Floating Flower make cosmic waves for anyone who wants to tag     along.  The simple acoustic guitar figures might fool you into thinking     this was something to soothe and relax, and though that is one option,     it's not nearly that passive 12 minutes into an epic trip.</p>
<p>""Wave Ring"" finds all the elements of Floating Flower's sound in place, as     the tablas provide an omnipresent gallop for the melancholy guitar line and     Yuki's reverb-laden soprano.  For better than 10 minutes, the trio vamps     into the nether regions of the soul.  And the song would be mind-numbingly     repetitive were it not for that massive funnel cloud of sound I spoke of     earlier.  At first, it's restrained by the more minstrelsy ensemble sound,     but over the song's course, it's transformed into a raging cylinder.  To     make it through this music, it's probably best to let it wash over you like     the incoming tide, drowning in wave after wave of sonically/chemically altered     magic.  Otherwise, you're likely to be as lost as Yuki and Tetsuya in Nepal.</p>

    wander in a corn field as CDs rain down on them from the sky. A voice asks, ""Are you too... functional? Do
    you get up in the morning and do what is expected of you with marginally admirable resolve? Then you may be
    one of millions of Americans who suffer from A-OK Disorder. Ask your doctor about Euphone. Studies show that
    Euphone can reduce your hectic, vervy self to a blissy, horizontal bag of fluid. Isn't it time you were lured
    into a prolonged, sophisticated coma? For years, Euphone has been one of the most trusted names in helping
    people disappear...""</p><p>
    
    And Korg have mercy if Euphone doesn't deliver the numbness you seek on this not-quite full-length, kicking
    out the slow jams with characteristic anti-brio.  <i>The Lakewood</i> is less the panacea that the band's
    past efforts labored to be-- rather it septuple-tasks, like one of those snack samplers your neglectful
    careerist mammy used to shove into your lunch sack along with a frigid helping of last night' tater tots
    and fish sticks.  Nothing here tastes like its neighbors, as the band springboards from tone to tone and
    from mode to mode, isolating their own divergent strains as if unraveling their own genomes.</p><p>
    
    So you get ""The Lakewood Burning Bad Boy"" whose big-drum angular-fest calls to mind a juke-joint Don Cab.
    All of a sudden you're struck by the quiet storm of ""Tools of Love"" whose echoing, dueling foregrounded and
    backgrounded keys assist the breathy vocals (can't nobody call Euphone wordless no more!) to sound like a
    white N.E.R.D.  ""The Baldwin Wipeout"" is a show-offy solo piano nugget too retro for the album's own good,
    as its hyperactive Scott-Joplinisms build and then fizz.</p><p>
    
    ""Homodulations"" is another vocal track (!),
    self-consciously juxtaposing raucous axery with disparate disco slinkiness.  ""Fanfare""'s delayed sticks and
    gorgeous bass pirate moves from Isotope 217 to eerily duplicates Squarepusher's <i>Budakhan Mindphone</i>.
    The wailing organ on the Coltrane cover, ""Countdown"", is another prime display but points to Euphone's
    flaw: straight jazz overhaunts their hints at groundbreaking post-jazz.  The closer, ""Passing Notes"", is
    a tribute to Euphone's strengths, though, as it does so much with so little.  People talk about impressive
    power trios, but this subdued three-piece conjures a staggering amount of atmosphere, especially when rooted
    with only a handful of syrupy bass notes.</p><p>
    
    The earth-toned, streamlined digital chaos of the packaging is fitting for this release, and hell, any band
    that thanks James Bond and Wilco's Leroy Bach can't be too lost.  Even the pristine cloudiness of the
    production is dead-on. Yet one wishes Euphone would get a little more recklessly inventive like the geniuses
    who thought up Reese's Peanut Butter Birth Control Cups and perpendicular bowling lanes. The masterful
    fingerwork is a tad conventional, is all. That said, <i>The Lakewood</i> is a variety show put on by
    instrument-swapping multi-instrumentalists that plays like a feeding frenzy on depressants. I dare you to
    set your CD player alarm to start with this electric dandelion. You won't ever wake up.</p></div>"|2845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2845-the-lakewood/|7.0|William Bowers

They're also giddy and utterly daft.
    But buzzing through two-minute power-punk tunes like teen boys who've found a landmine and can't wait to
    huck rocks at it, Mclusky are, more than anything, tremendous, stupid fun.  And no question about it:
    they've got impact like knocking skulls in a bar fight.</p><p>
    
    Recorded in Chicago with Steve Albini, Mclusky's second album takes advantage of his knack for making bands
    sound viciously loud and tight beyond comprehension, thereby trumping their interesting but unfocused UK
    debut, 2000's <i>My Pain and Sadness is More Sad and Painful Than Yours</i>.  ""Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues""
    kicks it off, with Mat Harding's drums rolling like hubcaps down a hillside into the power-riff bash of
    Jon Chapple's bass and Andy Falkous's buzzsaw guitar; they're so on cue that the only random element is
    Falkous's vocals, as he sticks keening wails, frenzied gibbering, and diaphragm-tearing shouts into the
    comic crime story lyrics.  In fact, due undoubtedly to Albini's production and the erratic vocals, Mclusky
    have recently been compared to the Pixies: they have the same knack for taking essentially straight-up
    songs and wracking them with nervous energy.  Of course, unlike vintage Black Francis, Falkous's vocals
    don't sound maniacal or out of control; they're just deftly witty and humorously exaggerated.</p><p>
    
    Most of <i>Mclusky Do Dallas</i> holds this pace, but infectiously poppy songwriting always girds the
    extreme elements.  This works to keep the mood varied, as the band stretches out barbed-wire guitar lines
    like the one on ""Collagen Rock"", or follows the easy stride and sudden fits of a song like ""Alan is a
    Cowboy Killer"".  And frankly, American teen skater bands <i>wish</i> they could write a power-punk anthem
    as instantly unforgettable and insanely insidious as ""Day of the Deadringers"".  Yet, Mclusky also admirably
    deliver on an entirely different level: check the stark contrast of ""Fuck This Band"", an extremely quiet
    track consisting of almost nothing but a bassline and Falkous's weary moans.</p><p>
    
    Despite the band's tightrope tension, however, their sense of humor may be their most successful element.
    These guys are plain obnoxious.  It's not that they crack first-grade jokes about herpes and bloodfarts--
    they just have a way of combining crass taunts with awesome non-sequiturs.  One track opens, ""All of your
    friends are cunts/ Your mother is a ballpoint pen thief.""  Or the line from their single ""To Hell with Good
    Intentions"": ""My love is bigger than your love/ We take more drugs than a touring funk band, sing it!""</p><p>
    
    That's all good for a few chuckles, but the humor helps to lighten the harsh crunch of their mom-murdering
    instrumental beatdown-- their intensity is balanced by the fact that they're just damn entertaining.  It
    gives them an outlet for the edginess and a way to take the piss out of themselves.  And while it also makes
    them less revolutionary, it does make them more enjoyable. ""So, they're original, but are they challenging
    and unusual?""  Not so much.  But don't you get enough of that?  This is only one of the tightest, jumpiest,
    straight-up rock albums around.</p></div>"|5185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5185-mclusky-do-dallas/|8.4|Chris Dahlen

    what you do that really counts, but whom you do it with. By enlisting new recruits to his Orchestra, Jason
    Swinscoe has sloughed the derivative mannerisms that marred 1999's <i>Motion</i> and 2000's <i>Remixes
    1998-2000</i>-- where those two albums sounded stiff and crippled by the weight of overt influence,
    <i>Every Day</i> is both stately and loose.  And by ditching his Miles Davis/Gil Evans stance and embracing
    freer jazz elements, Swinscoe has finally achieved a much-needed spaciousness and grandeur in his music.</p><p>
    Much of the credit for this new openness must be given to guest vocalist Fontella Bass-- Lester Bowie's
    fearsomely voiced ex-wife and erstwhile member of the Art Ensemble of Chicago-- whose presence brings an
    immense dignity to the album.  Just as David Axelrod's self-titled 2001 LP on Mo'Wax was pushed beyond its
    label's confines by Lou Rawls's performance of ""Loved Boy"", so does Bass's rendition of ""All That You Give""
    push <i>Everyday</i> beyond the scratchadelic goofiness I've come to associate with Ninja Tune.</p><p>
    ""All That You Give"" begins with harpist Rhodri Davis laying out chromatic clusters of sound through which
    strings and Luke Flowers's leaning drums make a steady course. After a swift key change, Fontella's august
    vocal emerges.  The simple lyric and Bass's cooing and humming give the song an almost hymnal quality.
    It's as though Bass is imprecating a soul, attempting to coax someone's essence into view.</p><p>
    Such an opener is hard to follow and Swinscoe knows it. The opening minutes of ""Burn Out"" consist of
    percussion and a stern bass figure similar to the one that underpinned the Irresistible Force's ""Nepalese
    Bliss"". Swinscoe's giving the listener time to absorb the solemn power of ""All That You Give"" and prepare
    for the remainder of the album. Three minutes into ""Burn Out"", sampled gospel voices intertwine before John
    Ellis begins an extended electric piano solo. Closely stacked horns occasionally puncture his lines,
    recalling the tonalities Swinscoe proliferated through <i>Motion</i>.</p><p>
    ""Flite"" picks up the tempo and heads the listener into marimba-lead broken beats. Flowers' maintenance of
    the breaks is impressive and the other players leave him to show off through the track's six minutes. There's
    no sitting out during ""Evolution""-- the second track Fontella Bass brings her wisdom to. Starting off almost
    as a spoken word piece, with Ellis's piano commenting on Bass's words, ""Evolution"" quickly transforms into a
    fiery prayer with Bass hollering the title. At this point the Cinematic Orchestra really parade their skills
    and channel the spirit of Les McCann's cosmic jazz masterpiece, <i>Invitation to Openness</i>-- albeit
    updated with DJ Food-member Patrick Carpenter's lysergic turntable scratches.</p><p>
    Just as ""Flite"" belonged to drummer Flowers, ""The Man with Movie Camera"" belongs to soprano saxophonist Tom
    Chant. He threads sharp Pharoahic lines through Flowers's cascading kicks, rimshots, tom-tom rolls until the
    group surges out into territory first mapped by Alice Coltrane.  Then, after those minutes of mystical groove,
    <i>Every Day</i> turns back to serenity for the contemplative, doubting, restless ""All Things to All Men"",
    featuring Roots Manuva.  For the performance of his career, Roots Manuva drops his Stockwell rudie schtick
    for a philosophical self-examination that never descends into navel-gazing or therapy-babble.</p><p>
<i>Every Day</i> closes with the title track, a showcase for the man who has provided the surest foundation
    throughout, bassist Phil France. France gets ninety seconds to bare his soul before Swinscoe brings in Flowers's
    delicate cymbal dance to add tonal color. The combination is cosmic drum-n-bass: Flowers and France match
    Fontella Bass's grandeur and forcefulness. I can't conceive of a more fitting conclusion to this incredibly
    commanding album. Swinscoe has escaped his influences and marked out his own genus of non-aligned spiritual
    music.</p><p>
    While <i>Every Day</i> is often too serene to be appropriately described as ""fire music"", the essence of
    Coltrane and Albert Ayler are very much present. Yet, as impressed as I am by the record, I can't delude
    myself that this album will alter the opinions of those of you who insist that jazz is dead. Lacking the
    mathy awkwardness of Andrew Pekler's <i>Station to Station</i> or the jam-band frivolity of Medeski, Martin
    &amp; Wood, <i>Every Day</i> lacks angles that can be used as polemical poignards. Outside of the downtempo/chill-out
    community, this album's even distribution of majesty and poise may work against its acceptance in more
    outré circles-- more fool those who don't embrace what is, in the simplest terms, a flawless collection.</p></div>"|1469.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1469-every-day/|8.6|Paul Cooper

    the man downstairs-- he's getting a raw deal.  After, I dunno, about a billion marginally more successful
    releases as Non, Rice's latest shout-out to Ol' Scratch, <i>Children of the Black Sun</i>, is bleak,
    ""cinematic"", and entirely un-fucking-listenable.  I wouldn't call myself a fan of his earlier work, but
    before this burnt offering Rice could at least be counted on to produce albums of texture, substance, or
    even both-- each the absolute lifeblood of experimental music.  The majority of this album, however, sounds
    like whatever noise I imagine might be produced by playing a vinyl record scratched to pure white.</p><p>
    
    Now I know how it feels to die for my audience.  I've listened to this album several times, each listen
    more painful than the last, in an effort to warn you as effectively as I possibly can to stay away from it.
    Allow me to itemize the debt (you can count the sounds on this album without even
    taking off your shoes): an large brass section tunes-up on a single continuous tone for four minutes on
    ""Black Sun""; a half-dozen extremely ""dramatic"" guitar notes are plucked on ""Serpent of the Heavens""; three
    vocal samples, some rain... there might be a bee somewhere!  Sweet crispy Christ, at least <i>Receive the
    Flame</i> had helicopters!  Regardless, these noises only account for about 10% of the album.  The other
    90% is an irritatingly constant hum that fluctuates between ""whine"" and ""causes brain cancer"".</p><p>
    
    Oh, wait!  Maybe I spoke too soon!  There's also a DVD with a Dolby 5.1 mix on it!  That's good, maybe the
    other 3.1 channels are the ones with the freakin' sounds on them.  I can't wait to try this...</p><p>
    
    ...Thirty-one minutes later, and my ordeal with this pile of aural leakage is finally complete. <i>Now</i>
    I can say with certainty that the only thing worse than enduring the low-level bass drone in two channels
    is being surrounded by it.  Two channels won't confuse the basic fight-or-flight response provoked by this
    vacuum of an album because at least you'll know which way to run.  Not so with the Dolby mix-- you won't
    know <i>where</i> to turn when this steaming pile comes at you from every direction at once!  It's scarier
    than <i>Jason X</i>!  But more frightening still is that someone thought this was a good idea.  Rice's
    denser, less awful past work could benefit from this technology, but it's wasted here.</p><p>
    
    Now, if I were in a really generous mood, I would give Rice the
    benefit of the doubt and say that he was trying to produce something along the lines of Coil's drone
    masterwork <i>Time Machines</i>.  I would also say, of course, that he neglected to realize the necessity
    of the hypnotic elements at work below the surface of its simple, lulling sines and cosines, and attempted
    to generate a similar effect through random fluctuations in the constant thrum of <i>Children</i>.
    Naturally, this utterly, irrevocably fails.  Without some sort of underlying organization to the drone,
    it resembles white noise and is readily tuned out, leaving little-to-nothing left to hold the listener.
    If that was Rice's aim, then, perhaps, he succeeds, but that the result is comprised of near-white noise
    is hardly something to smile about.</p><p>
    
    But you know what?  I'll even go a step further.  Rather than just bitching about how astoundingly empty
    this Non-release is, I'll offer a positive alternative (I'm Libra, I strive for balance).  Go to the kitchen
    and find two appliances-- toasters, cuisinarts, blenders, what have you.  Hold one in each hand.  Smash
    them together for fifteen minutes.  Now you've just had as much fun (if not more) than listening to
    <i>Children of the Black Sun</i>, and in half the time.  Don't say I never gave you anything.</p></div>"|5829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5829-children-of-the-black-sun/|0.5|Eric Carr

    <i>Binokular</i> in collaboration with associate KPT.michi.gan. The record
    was solid straight through, but it received notice primarily because it
    contained a cover of The Smiths' classic ""There Is a Light That Never Goes
    Out,"" re-titled ""The Light 3000"" and given a serious digital makeover,
    complete with robotic voices and squishy programming.</p><p>
    
    Two years on, it's clear that ""The Light 3000"" will be seen as something of
    a landmark in the small, cloistered world of IDM. This clever cover essentially
    expanded the emotional range of the genre, showing that quirky, abstract
    electronic production could be integrated seamlessly into a pop context.
    By dressing up a familiar tune in vibrant electronic tones, Schneider TM
    showed that glitchy electronic pop could evoke nostalgia, express sadness
    and longing, and give the head-nodding set something to sing along to.</p><p>
<i>Zoomer</i>, Schneider TM's second full-length after 1998's <i>Moist</i>,
    finds Dresselhaus moving further along the pop path. His vocals are featured
    prominently on over half the tracks, sometimes sans-processing. The first
    thing that came to mind when I heard <i>Zoomer</i> is that this is the album
    Air could have made after <i>Moon Safari</i> if they'd traded in the analog
    gear for a Powerbook and forgotten about rock entirely. There's a kind of
    folksy lounginess to the melodies and arrangements here reminiscent of the
    French band; I believe it's the same sort of vibe that compels Air to work
    with Beck.</p><p>
    
    But while the tunes draw from tradition, the underlying production is pure
    Third Millennium Germany, the sort of warm, squelchy machine music birthed
    by Mouse on Mars on <i>Vulvaland</i> and gestated throughout the 90s by
    kindred spirits at the A-Musik label. It's an electronic sound made for pop,
    as anyone who's heard Yamo (the collaboration between Wolfgang Flur and Mouse
    on Mars) can attest, but here it's given an even more song-oriented context,
    and it works beautifully.</p><p>
    
    The proper songs are front-loaded on <i>Zoomer</i>. Of the first five tracks,
    one is heavily processed robotic folk (""Reality Check""), one is a sun-kissed
    feature for harmony vocals (""Frogtoise""), one is a jazzy croon that reminds
    me of The Sea &amp; Cake (""Abyss""), one is a smiling, upbeat track that sounds
    like something on Nobukazu Takemura's <i>Childisc</i> (""DJ Guy""), and one is
    a surprisingly funky rap that owes a lot to UK Garage (""Turn On"", with vocals
    by Max Turner). After that, two instrumentals follow, thick with the glow of
    harmonic distortion, bubbling over with cracks and pops, and generally making
    a fine racket. The downcast ""Cuba TM"" ends the album on a similar note to the
    opener, but with busier digital production and a more melancholy feel.</p><p>
<i>Zoomer</i> is a very, very good album, but one thing it makes clear is that
    the songwriting aspect of this sort of lap[pop] hybrid must continue to improve.
    I haven't quoted any lyrics here because they're just not that memorable,
    and while the tunes themselves are always good, another listen to ""The Light
    3000"" makes clear that Dresselhaus is far cry from Johnny Marr. Still, I
    love the direction Schneider TM seems to be moving in with <i>Zoomer</i>.
    When you've been listening to a lot of abstract electronic music and you're
    hoping for a bit more melody, this is exactly what you want to hear.</p></div>"|7027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7027-zoomer/|8.5|Mark Richardson

We've had our eyes on you for some time now, and, with
    the release of your debut album, <i>Sha Sha</i>, we felt it was time to invite you up for a private tour.
    At this point in time it's far too early to tell whether you'll one day earn the privilege of enshrinement
    into our hallowed halls, but we hope that some time in the presence of your fellow Benjamins will help you
    along the route towards feats as notable as those of your namely peers.</p><p>
    
    Benjamin, in the Holy Bible (and Andrew Lloyd Weber's delightful hit musical), was the youngest and favorite
    son of Jacob, and here at the Hall of Bens, we honor all of those who accomplish greatness or public notice
    while sporting such an esteemed name.  From Benjamin Franklin, our nation's first great scientist, to Ben
    Kingsley, acclaimed actor, to Ben Ali, owner/founder of D.C. landmark Ben's Chili Bowl (13th and U St.,
    folks, don't miss it!).  Ah, but I see your interest is naturally drawn by the Musician's Wing.  Let us
    enter, and explore your ties to famous rock Bens of the recent past.</p><p>
    
    Ben Lee: Funny you should stop here, as you remind me a lot of Mr Lee.  Like you, young Ben was a precocious
    indie popster, earning attention far beyond his age and, some say, his talent.  Lee rose to fame with his
    Australian outfit Noise Addict before making a number of barely noticed solo records.  <i>You</i> earned a
    certain 10-watt glow of fame with Texas power-pop act Radish, and are now releasing the notorious solo major
    label debut after some cultish tiny recordings.  Lee could claim friendship with the Beastie Boys and was
    signed under their Grand Royal imprint; you, if your liner-note thank yous are to be believed, are pals with
    the Moldy Peaches and Wilco.  Need I go on?  Make a note: slow down the hype train while there's still time.</p><p>
    
    Ben Folds: Indeed, one of the more polarizing figures in 90s indie circles.  Some enjoyed the NC native's
    tongue-firmly-in-cheek update of 70s Billy Joel piano rock; others found it too thick with irony.  It's
    pretty clear from <i>Sha Sha</i> which camp you throw your loyalties behind; in fact, it's clear from the
    opening track, ""How It Should Be"", built around a hard-fisted piano progression and winkingly detached
    nonsense pop syllables.  A handful of other Foldsian influences reveal themselves on your record, like
    ""Falling"" or the centerpiece ""In Other Words"", both of which run from tangent to schlocky schmaltz not
    unlike a good chunk of the BF5 catalog.  Kudos to you, young sir, for balancing out the latter epic's
    showstopping coda with some well-utilized steel guitar and banjo, allowing for a sideswipe near miss of
    the syrup tanker truck.  Remember what you've learned and you will avoid the mistakes of your predecessors.</p><p>
    
    Ben ""Rivers"" Cuomo: Few people know that Weezer CEO Cuomo is not 'Rivers' by birth, but rather something
    of a self-loathing Benjamin.  Few people know this because it is a complete fabrication.  Nevertheless, you
    leave me no other choice but to mention his name, as every time you pick up a guitar on <i>Sha Sha</i> his
    thick-bespectacled visage is brought to mind.  Do not worry, many have worked at Weezer forgery since 1994,
    and your work is among the better third.  In fact, one could probably make an EP out of ""Wasted and Ready"",
    ""Commerce, TX"", ""Harriet's Got a Song"", and ""No Reason"", and make a small killing passing it off as the
    lost transition between <i>Pinkerton</i> and <i>The Green Album</i> on eBay.  You've got Cuomo's
    self-deprecation addiction down perfectly (""I'm maxed out like a credit card,"" from ""Wasted and Ready"")
    and the timeless-melodies-meeting-overdrive-crunch formula is as good as recent Weezer, if not their golden
    age.</p><p>
    
    But this leads me to my most valuable piece of advice: you must find your own voice, young Kweller, and rely
    less on the Benjamins who have come before you.  I'm quite positive you've got it in you: it shows on ""Lizzy"",
    a rare, stripped-down folk-arranged ditty that puts aside the clever detachment for a rather touching Kodak
    moment.  Right now your slightly-too-frequent derivative moments can be mostly forgiven thanks to heaping
    helpings of youthful earnestness, but I know you can be more than just a ""Recommended If You Like...""
    cross-reference.  We'll keep a spot open for you, my boy, now go do your fellow Bens proud!</p></div>"|4552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4552-sha-sha/|6.7|Rob Mitchum

And if you <em>have</em> already listened to all 56 minutes and 14 seconds of <em>Front End     Lifter</em>, I can assure you that your reaction will be hitting the garbage can on a quest for the golden     receipt.  Logic doesn't so much elevate the art of turntablism as put it in Velcro shoes and stick it on     the short bus. Yeah, yeah, <em>Combustication</em> was pretty good, sure. But have you ever heard his <em>Day     and Night</em> cassettes?  Jesus!</p>
<p>This all goes double for Reid, and the rest of Living Colour, who all appear here in various supporting     roles. It's obvious that Reid and Logic are aware of current alternative musical trends; the pseudo funk     and hip-hop hybridization of ""6996-club-yohimbe"", for example, is sure as hell looking towards the West     Coast whilst French-tickling the bling-bling sounds of Power 99 FM for inspiration.  Problem is, it's so     overloaded with half-assed rhymes (courtesy of Prince Paul and Slick Rick, among others) that the funk is     utterly smothered.  So yes, the Yohimbe Brothers are aware of other genres. But knowing Italian is a whole     lot different than speaking the shit, know what I mean?   Reid and Logic are two tongue-tied pseudo-hip     motherfuckers.</p>
<p>Reid was playing guitar on records as early as 1981, but you'd be hard-pressed to hear anything beyond     mediocre here. ""Prelude to a Diss"" (did they know?) is shiftless textural noodling.  For all of its Bela     Fleck influences, ""Bamalamb"" proves that Logic was able to garner nothing from his guest appearances with     Fleck, something that doesn't help Reid, who ties up a struggling beatbox rhythm with more useless riffing     than all two hours of ""Alternative Nation"". The harmonica and violin are like two white kids jamming on     Tom Petty on the sidewalks of Harlem: sore thumbs all around. And the opener, ""Ponk"", is the worst of the     lot, a needless mishmash of badly mixed rock 'n' roll noise that isn't fit to lick Buckethead's middle     finger.  Kicking off with a fairly boring rock instrumental on a record that purports to feature music that     ""may cause extreme sexual excitability"" (it really <em>says</em> that) and asks us not to complain about the     record unless we can explain it is like painting a target on your ass. So allow me:</p>
<p>Dear Yohimbe Brothers,<br/> I <em>can</em> explain it:  it's lame, you dumb shits.</p>

Released under the moniker Vsnares, <i>2370894</i> is, in many ways, an homage to the prevailing sounds of British experimental electronic music (which could     mean a whole shitload of things, really-- I'm thinking Skam, v/vm, Rephlex, etc). The album is comprised of     tracks both unreleased and left over from the sessions for other Venetian Snares releases, and is a slight     detour from Aaron's usual speedbreaks assault. The dark atmospherics and menace of <i>Printf</i> or <i>Doll     Doll Doll</i> has been traded for a more playful, loose vibe, but despite this being an odds-and-sods sort     of album, it's amazingly cohesive, and far from your standard tossed-off amalgam of half-baked leftovers.</p>
<p>""Fuck Toronto Jungle"" and ""Sybian Rock"" come the closest to revisiting the established Venetian Snares     sound (something like: ""See that Amen break?  Stick a firecracker up its ass, it's hilarious.  Okay, now     eat it"").  With their oddly timed, warp-speed rhythmic structures, and breakbeats more sliced and diced     than cucumbers on ""Iron Chef"", both tracks are remainders from previous Snares endeavors (<i>Higgins</i> and     <i>Making Orange Things</i>, respectively). ""Ornamental Grape Bone"", while managing to out-shit the     <i>Shitfuckers</i> EP in terms of rhythmic complexity, doesn't seem fully formed, coming off instead as     a rough sketch study of Funk's break-neck loop editing.  But that's all that's needed, really-- Funk has     already proven himself a master of that particular aural domain.  And for the rest of <i>2370894</i>, the     mission statement seems to be: what's so hard about that?</p>
<p>Imagine if Rephlex and Warp Records picked up and relocated to Saskatchewan. The artist himself describes     his track ""Twisting Ligneous"", a number straight out of Tom Jenkinson's closet, as ""Lee Perry forcing     Stockhausen and Squarepusher to do it at gun point while giving them gasoline enemas."" Premium, no unleaded,     and the raga dub interlude is the cherry on top. ""Happy Morning Condom Factory"" takes off midway through     with a chiming analog melody set to stuttering drum-n-bass that would make Aphex Twin proud. Hell, doesn't     the title of the final track, a graceful, <i>Selected Ambient Works</i>-inspired slice of lazy heaven called     ""British IDM Presets Fanfare (The Hawaiian Hockey Song)"" spell it out? Are ice hockey and cricket the new     peanut butter and jelly? If Boards of Canada are coming to tea, they're gonna end up on a meat hook for sure.</p>
<p>Despite all the references and italics, <i>2370894</i> can be judged on its own merits as well. Aside from     the borrowing and lending, there are sounds here that are pure Vsnares inventions. ""Nobody Really     Understands Anybody"" blends a strange ambient wash with random kick and high hat stabs, culminating in the     addition of (and someone check this for me) a crooning, echo-laden Morrissey snippet. ""We Are Cesspools"" is     listening to an orchestral jazz number on a ketamine binge, and the 8-bit hip-hop of ""Stamina (ft. Cex)     (Instrumental)"" is a fresh take, eschewing the styles of many American glitch-hoppers with a more basic,     stripped-down approach: electro-inspired breaks and strings that sound ripped from <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>.     The fact that I didn't have to listen to Cex's lame rhymes only made it sweeter.</p>
<p>So, yeah, there's lots of good stuff here.  However, <i>2370894</i> still isn't up there with releases like     <i>Shitfuckers</i> or <i>Printf</i>-- and most of the tracks lack the instant punch of ""Breakbeat Malaria"" or     ""Skelechairs"". Still, this album is more than the sum of its parts. It's a peek at Venetian Snares on the     weekend, messing around with new approaches to his sound, drinking some beers, watching TV.  It's like     paging through a Chris Ware sketchbook: even the rough shit is still amazing.</p></div>"|8440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8440-2370894/|8.0|Mark Martelli

    You Black Emperor! track ""Dead Flag Blues"" goes, ""We're all trapped inside
    the belly of this horrible machine, and the machine is bleeding to death.""
    You ever wondered what it sounds like inside of this horrible machine? Not
    GYBE!, I'll tell you that. The guitar tone is too warm, for one thing, and
    what kind of hemorrhaging death trap has violins?  With <i>Sprung</i>,
    Canadian techno artist Andrew Duke has crafted one possible soundtrack.</p><p>
    
    Duke has been around for a while, but this album for French imprint Bip Hop
    is his first release to receive wide distribution outside DJ circles. Duke's
    m.o. is midnight black, clanging machine techno of the sort Richie Hawtin
    crafts when he's in the mood, and that Thomas Brinkman has perfected.
    Heavily inspired by the sounds of Detroit, Duke shares some of Drexciya's
    fascination with the techno/electro crossroads, but Duke's album is much
    further removed from the conventions of early hip-hop. Only the opening
    track, ""Hell Yeah"", is really electro proper, and here Duke remains fixated
    on the gloomy, mechanistic attributes of the genre, like Cybotron with a
    dense coat of drop-forge grime. No way a joyous b-boy could pop 'n' lock to
    this thing.</p><p>
    
    After this opening cut, <i>Sprung</i> takes a much more abstract turn. Most
    tracks are built on a series of highly repetitive loops that morph slowly over
    time, the patterns incorporating scrapes, hisses, and the occasional synth
    flourish. The recurring mental image I get when listening is the kind of
    comically complex machine Wile E. Coyote used to order from Acme, with
    dozens of dials, pipes, cords, wheels and other assorted devices popping out
    in every direction. With each new track, one of these massive top-heavy
    devices is set spinning, and as it wheezes and wobbles in place, the machine
    coughs up chunks of metal, fittings loosen, and fasteners give way. The
    racket swells and becomes chaotic before peaking and receding again.</p><p>
    
    There's no mistaking how <em>alive</em> these death sounds are-- due in part
    to Duke's feel for structure. The sense of pacing is something to behold, as
    the tracks on <i>Sprung</i> remain in a state of perpetual motion, always
    either building or falling apart. Despite the loop-driven nature of the
    composition, these tracks never seem static, and as far as albums go,
    <i>Sprung</i> certainly seems fully realized. Still, despite its merits,
    I have to say that it's not often that I'll want to listen to something this
    ice cold and bleak from start to finish. In some respects, the tension inside
    the music doesn't quite reach the pitch it could, since the overall mood never
    wavers from a punishing sense of desolation. A few shafts of light might have
    made the darkness blacker still. But if you're in the mood to climb into the
    rusty innards of that iron beast, this is your ticket.</p></div>"|2474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2474-sprung/|6.8|Mark Richardson

My
    sphere of approval lodges in a nifty rut, and then the universe smacks me down. I heard ""Love Will Tear Us
    Apart"" booming from a Hooters patio this week and dry-heaved all the way home. A bouncer forcibly ejected
    me and my rowdy crew from a mosh pit after Hank Williams III allowed his performance to plummet from the
    heights of western swing into the basin of bootleg Pantera-dom.  The best hip-hop is continuing to shed
    the worst hip-hop's old materialist and self-assured skin, fermenting into a legitimate source of new kinds
    of information (perhaps this phenom is a reaction to the turn-back-the-clockness of having Bush Jr hogging
    the free world's mic). And don't get me started on those song-blending glitch artists, because Nurse Swanson's
    itching to double my meds at the slightest sign of agitation.</p><p>
    
    What I'm saying is: music-geekdom of late requires Promethean elasticity. People are either becoming
    all-approving record-store globalists, or they're splitting into camps.  A few days ago, some folks bailed
    from the Will Oldham listserv because they realized that electronic music now dominates their tastes, and
    that they're no longer excited by the predictable Drag City/alt-country banter.</p><p>
    
    What I'm saying is: Dave Pajo's Papa M career is a daggum security blanket for anyone whose faith in
    minimalist mopeyness has been shaken by the current trend toward amplitude and velocity (be it blasting
    from a six-string or a drum machine). <i>Songs of Mac</i>-- an album of renditions of lyrics by unknowns
    Aubrey Rozier and Mac Finley-- wears its lethargy on its sleeve, giddily approaching a style so airy and
    simple that it could be labeled 'no-core'. As if acknowledging that the emptinesses between stars are the
    biggest in the universe, Pajo shrugs off his resume's density (Slint, Tortoise, the forthcoming Zwan) and
    embraces his lean years as Oldham's waltz-happy co-pilot.</p><p>
    
    And let's face it, you and I, Oldham's grubby digits are all over Pajo's vocal output. The Bonnie slut
    either sings backup, or the songs reek of his skeeter-gothic early days-- the arrangements are spookily
    similar (and understandably so, since Pajo was Will's offensive coordinator back in the day). This EP's
    ""The Person and The Skeleton,"" with its elliptical bassline, could be an ethereal outtake from <i>Arise,
    Therefore</i>, even though the tenderly plodding piano is sub-Grubbs as far as dissonant transitions are
    concerned. The song slithers into your psyche with the aid of a backwards loop of weirdness and a droning,
    digital cricket racket.  Then, just when the surreal imagery threatens to implode the thing, the song chokes
    on what sounds like a ringtone at the eight-minute mark. Beware the trance-factor: a friend and I drove to
    Astoria, Oregon to this song (hell yeah, where <i>Goonies</i> was filmed) and almost lulled our compact
    car off a ravine.</p><p>
    
    ""So Warped"" is a different kind of dirge altogether-- the rare downer that transfixes and inspires, to which
    you could jog around town and see slo-mo layers of meaning in the ho-hum machinations of mail carriers.
    If you've ever been pinned on a precipice between two attentive humans, neither of which were essential,
    then you'll love spending six minutes with the alienated speaker of lines such as these: ""One's got my mind
    my and one's got my soul/ But I can't tell either of them anything I know.""  And as long as you aren't
    bothered by how this song is almost a chord-for-chord double of Smog's ""Jar of Sand"" (from the <i>'Neath the
    Puke Tree</i> EP), you'll find that a hearty dose of desolate, uncomplicated rue can still swat the gnats
    away from your life's dirty bowl of cornbread-and-milk.</p></div>"|6155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6155-songs-of-mac-ep/|7.5|William Bowers

    personality it exudes and the feelings it engenders, than by conventional categories like genre.  It's
    how 60s free jazz came to be known as 'fire music', and how the hyperkinetic flux of drum-n-bass captured
    the sounds of the (urban) jungle in the 1990s.  The music I want to talk about takes the form of dissolution--
    whether of the mental sort, typified by the just-this-short-of-collapse doodling of the Jad Fair/Daniel
    Johnston set; or of the musical sort, found in serialist composition's note-clusters or the recent trend
    towards deconstructionist remixes.  In Howard Hello, we have a bit of both.</p><p>
    
    Marty Anderson comes to the group from Dilute, and Wendy Allen from The Court and Spark.  Kenseth Thibideau
    was formerly with Temporary Residence mainstays Tarentel, and also plays in Rumah Sakit and Thingy.
    Triangulate the trio and you might have the vaguest idea of what the band sounds like-- though it won't
    be entirely accurate.  ""Television"" leads you on at first with sensitive acoustic guitar picking, as if
    this might be an album of folk ballads.  But then the chords pick up speed, riffling into a blur like the
    experimental landscapes explored by John Fahey.  As the tangents diverge, a sample of found sound enters
    the piece, with crowd murmur and the whine of vehicle brakes.  A steel drum or Hawaiian guitar burbles in
    the background, strangely haunting.</p><p>
    
    The second track, ""Belief"", offers a more official statement of intent.  Wendy Allen's angelic vocals sigh
    into the sustained waves of an organ, rising and falling together.  The guitar spills outwards from
    underneath in a series of crystalline, toy-like figures.  After these euphoric moments, ""Revolution""
    darkens the mood.  A bluesy, minor key intro gets swept up by an undercurrent of distortion, continually
    shifting in and out of pitch.  Over this eerie backdrop Marty Anderson coos his creepy rasp of a voice,
    sounding more female than male, like Lydia Lunch on Quaaludes.  ""The only way out of here is in,"" he
    insists over and over, as the fraying feedback pries apart the rhythm.</p><p>
    
    What follows are a number of revisions of the three previous themes.  ""America"" reprises ""Belief"" with
    ethereal arpeggios, intricate trails spun out onto the warm bassline.  Though he doesn't sing on every
    track, Anderson comes in at the end here with another of his repeated phrases-- ""I couldn't say no.""
    ""Prozac"" follows as a serene meditation, full of contemplative pick-work chiming with echoing accents and
    chirpy phrases.  Howard Hello have a way of sounding both busy and calm at the same time; you can choose
    to hear the slow pulse of the low registers, or get wrapped up in the scribbles of the high-end.  ""Dream""
    illustrates the differential with bluesy chords inflated by clouds of synthesizers, and the interplay
    between the two reminds me of Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's careful collaboration on <i>Evening Star</i>.</p><p>
    
    Howard Hello have opened up a strange world here, a mesh of organic and synthesized sounds whose only
    apparent contemporary is Chris Rosenau's work as Collections of Colonies of Bees.  Their music alternates
    between quiet introspection and frenetic peaks, from Marty Anderson's hushed, unhinged musings to spiraling
    fret streams, the musical equivalent of babbling glossolalia.  They've found an effective technique in the
    twining of their strings: at times it sounds like the music is being torn apart by the tethers, while at
    others a whole range of new, microtonal bursts of sound are birthed out of the ultra-fast, frilly runs.
    Forty minutes pass without a hint of percussion, and you barely notice.  I'm not sure what the loose
    social-awareness of the song titles is supposed to mean, but Howard Hello offer a mysterious, intriguing
    escape from it all.</p></div>"|3939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3939-howard-hello/|7.5|Christopher Dare

    non-transcendent convergence with the Melvins, <i>Millennium Monsterwork</i>, on his Ipecac label.  My guess
    is that he wanted to set things straight by giving the band another show.  And so, Aberdeen's own unleashed
    their seventeenth record (fifth with Patton's young freak organization)-- making a grand total of five
    albums for the band in three years.  It's hard to know what's lifted the floodgate for Melvins releases in
    recent days, though a good guess might be that their increasing strangeness is opening new doors for their
    songwriting.  Or maybe it's just that they now have the freedom to release as many records as they want,
    whenever they want.</p><p>
    Whatever the case, on a roster with Fantômas, Ruins, Dälek, and Kid606, the Melvins' old-school molasses
    art-thrash seems positively quaint, if not for lack of effort on the band's part.  <i>Hostile Ambient
    Takeover</i> retains the Melvins' now very familiar stone-rock pound, and Buzz Osbourne's bullfrog growl
    yet makes clear that having a shitload of sludge riffs and an awesome drummer can only take you so far.
    Furthermore, I'm not so sure that the Melvins' relatively recent flair for the overtly weird is all that
    great a development.  Sure, Patton seems to love them, but in the 6+ minutes of ""Black Stooges"", with walls
    of dirty guitar, tricky time signatures and extended percussion solos, where the hell is the rock?  I think
    it's supposed to be 'out', but it sounds too routine amongst the rest of these guys' recent material-- and
    the massive outro of feedback isn't funny.</p><p>
    ""Dr. Geek"" sounds like prog-metal-rockabilly, like if Revered Horton Heat suddenly realized how cool Dream
    Theater was.  Of course, the Melvins are supposed to be inherently cooler than either of these bands, but
    that just makes it all the stranger to hear them going at it like this.  Similarly, ""The Brain Center at
    Whipples"" spends entirely too much time getting to the good riffs (takes them three minutes before the
    jamming truly commences), and ""Foaming"" is too much song for the one good idea it presents (in this case,
    the unexpected change of pace into almost pop/rock realms).</p><p>
    It's not all depressing, though: ""The Fool, The Meddling Idiot"" is classic Melvins brainfreeze, with more
    broken siren guitar and super slo-mo dynamics.  About two minutes in, the bottom drops out, Buzzo vomits a
    soliloquy of unintelligible atrocities, and before you know it, the band's right there shitting along with
    him.  Just as the mud threatens to swallow you whole, the song transforms into something like a slow-grind
    piano ballad-- out of nowhere, the Melvins are playing the soundtrack to some 80s slow jam.  And then, for
    no discernable reason, Clover lays down a quick indie-funk beat.  Now <i>that's</i> eclecticism!  But in
    the end, <i>Hostile Ambient Takeover</i>'s best moment is its shortest: ""Little Judas Chongo"" presses all
    the right hard buttons in only two minutes, suggesting that these guys still know how to grab hold of your
    balls in a pinch.</p><p>
    Skip <i>Hostile Ambient Takeover</i> if you want-- it's nothing spectacular-- but just remember: one day
    you're going to want to rock again.  The Melvins and Patton's various projects aren't always on time, but
    <i>Lysol</i>, <i>Houdini</i> and <i>Stoner Witch</i> are there as refresher courses in kicking out jams.
    Take them as prerequisites, and hit this in your spare time.</p></div>"|5220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5220-hostile-ambient-takeover/|5.6|Dominique Leone

    their second full-length, <i>The Bright Side</i>, their texture-focused mix of lo-fi keyboards and smearing
    guitars is rich, but more rough and spontaneous than polished and perfected.</p><p>
    
    The band's latest line-up includes Chris Renn on guitar and barely audible, somewhat weak vocals; Ben Lord
    on drums; and Dan Benningfield on keyboards and piano.  Thanks in part to producer Trevor Kampmann (aka
    hollAnd), the recording sounds loose even though considerable work must have gone into the arrangements.
    Renn and Lord lumber with effective repetitiveness while Benningfield layers in color-- from the vibrant,
    skyward-looking organ on ""Welcome to Orlando"" to the splurting synths on ""Completely Normal"".</p><p>
    
    Transcendent at one turn and slogging drearily the next, Kilowatthours have impressive dynamics.  If there's
    one thing they've nailed, it's going from quiet to loud to quiet again with the proper sense of drama. On
    ""Almost Airtight"", the album's most powerful track, the luminous intro sets up Renn and ex-member Ryan
    Compton to go supernova through the power-chord-bedecked bridge; then they shift down to quiet again, a
    few idle string plucks walking us into a sparse, jagged outro.  And the concise instrumental ""Dancers and
    Acrobats"" rolls through a simple, pretty keyboard riff and Lord's intermittent bashing.</p><p>
    
    But for all the style, <i>The Bright Side</i> falls short on substance.  There's a lack of tautness and
    hookiness to the material that makes it bleed together; few of the pieces aim higher than 'likeable'.
    Though most of the tracks have vocals, Renn's voice is buried by the mix.  And while this kind of
    indistinct singing may be a legitimate shoe-mo tactic, it doesn't make the album any stronger.</p><p>
    
    The subtle melodies only occasionally break out of the clouds, and the shambling performance that sounds so
    fresh on the 'big' numbers can turn into sludge on the slower ones; and with so many rich instrumentals,
    quaint songs like ""The Only Good Thing About Pollution"" just drift off into space.  Which is a shame,
    because stronger writing could have made this a gripping record, and not just a gorgeous one.</p></div>"|4428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4428-the-bright-side/|6.4|Chris Dahlen

    garner mainstream attention until after the planes crashed in the World Trade Center last September.  Before
    9/11, The Coup had been preparing to release their fourth album, <i>Party Music</i>, with the cover notoriously
    depicting Coup members Boots and Pam the Funkstress standing in front of an exploding World Trade Center with
    a mock detonator in hand.  That eerily prophetic album cover, and the subsequent press coverage that followed,
    bolstered The Coup's renown and provided a fitting metaphor for 9/11: America ignores voices of dissent until
    they become a threat.</p><p>
    
    Now that The Coup has the attention of the public and the FBI, FOAD records has
    decided to reissue The Coup's '98 classic <i>Steal This Album</i> with an additional disc of live material.
    If you already own this album, you won't have much use for the reissue; the live disc is nice, but definitely
    not worth the extra dough.  If, however, you are one of the unfortunate many who have yet to unearth this
    jewel, read on and discover for yourself the Communist-coated splendors of Oakland's finest.</p><p>
    
    The scorching and west-coast-funky ""The Shipment"" kicks the album off with a harmonica-laced beat that'll
    leave you shaking your ass and lighting a Molotov Cocktail. If Karl Marx had this much funk and charisma,
    we'd have toasted those bourgeois fucks decades ago! ""Exhilarating,"" Boots declares in an elastic flow that
    winds around a juicy bassline, ""I accuse you of nigga hating/ And exploitating for profit making/ Don't cop
    a plea cause I'm B double-O T from the C O U to the P.""   The best thing about Boots is that he doesn't
    sacrifice his clever wordplay and indelible flow in order to fit in his rather heady political concepts.
    How many emcees could pull off rhyming ""macrobiotic chemical colonic"" with ""political symphonic lyrical
    narcotic"" and not sound like a complete asshole?  But for Boots it's a seamless and natural progression.
    As the track fades out, Coup DJ Pam the Funkstress, who plays Engel to Boots' Marx, cuts up Prince singing
    ""thank you for a funky time."" This is a certified banger that may be one of the greatest kick-off tracks
    eva.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, this is not the album's highlight; that distinction belongs to the next track, ""Me and Jesus
    the Pimp in a '79 Grenada Last Night"". The song is a narrative about a pimp named Jesus who, after spending
    15 years in the slammer, finds himself face-to-face with the son of a prostitute he'd killed decades before.
    Boots spares no details as he dissects the myth of the heroic pimp that hip-hop has long perpetuated.  While
    the song's veiled social commentary is on point, the secret to the song's success is Boot's penchant for
    laying down evocative imagery in his rhymes. In the song's third verse, he observes how ""the red and white
    lights as the ambulance flies/ Reminds me of midnight in a dopefiend's eyes."" God<i>damn!</i></p><p>
    
    On the skit ""Pizza Man"", Hiero hero Del the Funky Homosapien plays a repo man who disguises himself as a
    pizza delivery boy in order to enter an old lady's apartment and repossess her TV.  The skit segues into
    ""The Repo Man Sings for You"" (also featuring Del), which is a sequel of sorts to ""Repo Man"" from the Coup's
    previous album <i>Genocide and Juice</i>.  As you could probably have guessed, Boots and Del have no love
    for this ""agent working for the man"" whose ""manuscript[s] say you owe him for this land."" In the song, Boots
    is victorious as he chases the repo man away, but a twinge of melancholy lingers as Boots implicitly
    acknowledges the inescapable nature of modern poverty. As witnessed in this song, Boots' ability to situate
    his political ideology in everyday situations is what distinguishes him from other neo-Marxist emcees.  He
    never dips into the overly didactic, and he's quick to insert humor into the songs whenever possible.</p><p>
    
    While the aforementioned tracks are the ones that may initially stand out, the entire album rocks harder
    than a detonated dirty bomb. A live band provides the instrumentation throughout, and Pam the Funkstress
    really shines on the 1s and 2s.  What's even more incredible about this album is how repeated listens bring
    out the nuances of Boots' politics and humor.  The only qualm I have with <i>Steal This Double Album</i> is
    the live album which, while pretty fresh, doesn't quite justify repurchasing the CD.  But if you don't
    already own this classic, you need to cop this now. Even if you're the sort that's put off by the album's
    anti-imperialism rhetoric, the skills on display here will have you seeing red-colored stars for days.</p></div>"|1632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1632-steal-this-double-album/|8.1|Sam Chennault

The Violent Femmes knew this, and with their 1983
    self-titled debut, they tapped into that brutal life-or-death urgency that surrounds all the frantic milestones
    of teendom-- cars, peers, and the anatomic wonders of biodiversity.  Maybe it all seems trivial (or at least
    somewhat diminished) in hindsight, but to someone just finding his or her legs as an adult, few things are
    more desirable.  Other bands were competent to discuss these dilemmas at arm's length, but Gordon Gano's
    empathetic tales embraced them with an angstful revelry.  As the frontman for the Femmes, he personified an
    anxiety attack; his jittery uncertainty was the sound of a man unraveling himself over a boy's problems.
    And it wasn't merely that Gano could relate-- if anything, he seemed like he had it <i>worse</i>.</p><p>
    
    Well, nearly twenty years after the dizzying highs (not heights, trust me) of the Violent Femmes' career,
    Gordon has finally hit the ground.  The concept behind this new record is stunningly simple: Gano has penned
    a couple of tunes for some of the musicians he's come to admire over the years, and they've agreed to sing
    them.  Big names, too!  Frank Black, PJ Harvey, They Might Be Giants...  Look!  John Cale sings right before
    Lou Reed-- that's almost like a Velvet Underground reunion!   Now, surely, this all sounds great in theory,
    but it dies in execution.  And before anyone worries that I'm going to compare this record to any of the
    Femmes' output, don't-- no one expects a Gano solo record to live up to the music he made with a full band
    twenty years ago.  Besides, <i>Hitting the Ground</i> has plenty of problems without the Femmes' legacy
    towering over it.</p><p>
    
    Let me first be upfront, though, about the few positives: some of these songs <i>are</i>, in fact, dangerously
    entertaining.  It's great to hear Lou doing his classic monotone over the broad funk riffs of ""Catch 'Em in
    the Act"".  Hell, this song is better than just about anything he's done on his own in a decade-- ridiculously
    clever lyrics involving various sexual predilections (proof that these songs were written with the vocalists
    in mind), smooth, slicked-back guitar lines, it's all there.  ""Darlin' Allison"", as performed by They Might
    Be Giants, is a quirky 50s-ish crooner filled with vibraphone and spacy, ethereal solos right out of ""Blue
    Moon"".  And let's not forget the true highlight of the album, ""It's Money"", featuring Gano and Martha
    Wainwright.  The only true duet here, this track almost recalls the easygoing bliss of latter-day Talking
    Heads songs like ""Radio Head"" or ""Nothing (But Flowers)"".  The point is (and you probably got this a while
    ago), <i>Hitting the Ground</i> isn't without its enjoyable moments.  So what's the problem, then?</p><p>
    
    The problem is this: none of these tracks are all that interesting beyond a listen or two-- even the best
    ones get tired fast.  (And suffice to say that <i>none</i> of these artists are at the peak of their powers
    anymore.)  I mean, it's awesome that John Cale dropped by to sing, and Lou Reed, and all of them, but all
    the PJ Harveys and Frank Blacks in the world can't hide the fact that these are singularly uninspired,
    repetitive songs.  The only thing that's selling these tracks is the star power, and that in <i>itself</i>
    is pretty offensive.  And then you've got the real scary tracks-- Cale's hammy piano number ""Don't Pretend""
    and Linda Perry's languid torch song ""So It Goes"" are outright <i>embarrassing</i>.</p><p>
    
    The title track might be the lone exception-- it's not the greatest by any measure, but the unforced ease
    with which Gano approximates the classic sound of the Femmes gives it a nice nostalgic appeal.  Subsequent
    listens to this one are far more rewarding than most of the other cuts, even if it's not as immediate.
    Which is good, too, since it's on here twice.  It makes me shake my head.  PJ Harvey opens with it, and
    Gano closes with it.  Come on!  This is only a 30-minute album to begin with-- does 20% of it really need
    to be this song?</p><p>
    
    Okay, so there's no getting around it: this shit's bland.  And I get the impression that Gordo himself
    <i>knew</i> it when he slapped this thing together, too, because he's clearly attempted to compensate for
    it with endless genre-hopping from track-to-track.  In a nutshell, what I'm telling you is that this record
    is, at best, not too far removed from your average various artists compilation, and at worst, little more
    than a novelty act.  Fun, perhaps, for a once-over, but after you've got this pony's single trick down, the
    only novelty left is seeing how quickly <i>Hitting the Ground</i> gathers dust.</p></div>"|3394.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3394-hitting-the-ground/|4.9|Eric Carr

Apes of Wrath
    have undertaken to redefine the term 'niche audience'.  Their music,
    while not abhorrent, is clearly packaged to sell a minimum number of
    records to the fewest number of listeners. I think they actually put
    a great deal of thought into this sales strategy.</p><p>
    
    Why would I say such a thing?  Other than me being a jackass, there
    are solid reasons for my conclusions.  What we have here is an LP
    ('long-player'), but in name only.  Not in practice, because in practice,
    this thing registers fifteen tracks and clocks in at a whopping fifteen
    minutes.  Again: fifteen tracks, fifteen minutes. Long-player. I'll do
    the math for you: that's 60 seconds per song.</p><p>
    
    Have you guessed the genre yet?  Yes, you have, because you're smart.
    Sure enough, these folks play punk music-- more specifically punk of the
    spaz-out, hardcore variety.  With a dash of 'art', in that they're
    incredibly fucking pretentious.  Mr Neutron plays guitar. Baldo plays the
    fucking bass. In a questionable move, vocalist/crack addict Brad Mowen
    takes ownership of the project and uses his real name. Vocalist is
    probably the right term for Mowen's approach to making noise, one which
    at times sounds like a small dog's cry for help.  At others it sounds
    like a small Glenn Danzig's cry for help.</p><p>
    
    Now is the part of the review where I don't tell you anything about the
    songs. Check that. Here's your nugget: they all sound the same.</p><p>
    
    Not to minimize Baldo or Mr Neutron's accomplishments, I will disclose
    the following to you: I was smiling for the larger part of this album.
    For one, Mowen had me in stitches, his voice spanning the full spectrum
    of dissonant, unintelligible nonsense. And the music, however concise,
    isn't all bad. It certainly has volume. And tempo. Sure, they never take
    the time to rock completely, but I sense that wasn't exactly the point.</p><p>
    
    Fifteen tracks, fifteen minutes, long-player.  Not much more to this disc
    than that. I imagine your choice will be about as simple.</p></div>"|221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/221-apes-of-wrath/|4.3|Brad Haywood

    hell of a lot like a manatee with legs. A member of the Proboscidea family (like its cousin the Wooly
    Mammoth), the mastodon stood almost ten feet tall and weighed in at roughly five tons-- surely a big beast
    by any measure. Lacking the killer instinct of its contemporaries, the Sabre-Toothed tiger and the
    Pterodactyl, the American Mastodon was content to browse, trolling the plains for tasty morsels of shrub.
    If you look at artist renderings, most paleontologists seem to think the good-natured Mastodon even enjoyed
    smiling! But as meek and mild as this beast was, its placid demeanor and limited diet-range rated low on
    Darwin's survival scale, and it thus perished once and for all in 800 A.D.</p><p>
    The implications may be benign, but it remains that the name 'Mastodon' still <i>sounds</i> pretty badass--
    certainly more badass than 'Manatee'. And I suppose it imports a metaphor that fits quite nicely for the
    <i>band</i> Mastodon, an Atlanta, GA-based quartet that has heavy-music lovers everywhere shitting themselves
    naked. For, like their namesake, this Mastodon represents something utterly imposing, primeval and oppressively
    heavy.</p><p>
    Mastodon, like pioneering heavy acts Botch, Isis, Converge and Dillinger Escape Plan, prefer to mix their
    metal with some hardcore, albeit with the strong emphasis on the 'metal' part.  The others place a premium
    on virtuoso musicianship and highly technical song structures, and while that also figures prominently into
    Mastodon's music, these boys slather it all up in a special sauce that I like to refer to as 'classic
    sauce.'  I'd like to give the credit for this sauce to heavy music über-producer Matt Bayles (Isis, Botch,
    Blood Brothers), but who really knows the sauce-source?  What the hell am I talking about?  I explain: I'm
    talking about the tight-jeans, Dodge Hemi, ""Starsky &amp; Hutch"" production quality, that's what-- the
    perfect complement to the prehistoric riffing featured all album long.  The recording sounds deliberately
    rustic and antiqued, like that milk-stained fake money you'd buy at the museum.  (Admit it: you loved that
    shit.)</p><p>
    But production is not what prods Mastodon.  What stimulates this band's formidable corpus are four
    super-proficient veteran musicians, two of whom (guitarist Bill Kelliher and drummer Brann Dailor) cut
    their tusks in Today Is the Day and Lethargy.  It's Dailor, though, who takes home the MVP award on
    <i>Remission</i>; if drummers are action figures, Dailor carries both a rapid-fire uzi (the toms) and
    an erase-all, double-barreled bazooka (dual-bass drums). I guarantee, he will <i>brutalize</i> you.</p><p>
    Like their metal peers, Mastodon sport some mathematics.  But where Meshuggah get deep into calculus and
    Dillinger Escape Plan prefer trigonometry, these guys enjoy the more accessible stuff-- we're talking
    pre-algebra here.  They drop in just enough to keep the arrangements flavorful, but not so much as to
    overload the vintage guitar riffs with Dream Theater-like complexity.  And then they counterbalance it
    with some nice, old-fashioned, Sabbath-style metal attitude: guitars crunch, wail, and burn. The complete
    package sounds timeless, but in that unbelievable way that you've never heard before.</p><p>
    Maybe there exists a parallel world where the mighty mastodon kept on walking.  And maybe, just maybe, that
    mastodon met a sabre-toothed tiger and maybe they had kids (work with me here). And those kids crossed over
    into <i>our</i> world, became human beings, moved to Atlanta, and formed a band.  A <i>great</i> band whose
    raging, sodden hellfire now beckons you to warm yourself at its side throughout the impending winter months.
    A band whose crushing, odiferous, sodomizing blade dices like a Popeil cuisinart and runs you through with
    gruesome exactness until you beg for <i>Remission</i>.  This band is Mastadon.  Thank God for the miracles
    of crossbreeding.</p></div>"|5142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5142-remission/|9.0|Brad Haywood

He's going to get John Zorn to be his Secretary of State, the Melvins     to be his army and Dave Lombardo to kick the shit out of all the people who didn't vote for him.  He's also     going to slowly gather all his other fave pals and give them cush jobs at the Ipecac Centre for Intellect     and Freak Metal-- and all of this in the name of balancing karma in an oh-so homogenized world.  Unfortunately,     it's not as easy as it sounds; President Patton can't deliver quality freak metal just by snapping his fingers.     Just like other idealistic young over-achievers (Zorn, Makoto Kawabata of Acid Mothers Temple), his desire     to break through the paltry provisions afforded most new music only means that he'll get an A for effort,     if not necessarily for output.  Alas, Patton will never be president.  Though if this record is any     indication, it's just as well.</p>
<p><i>Millennium Monsterwork</i> is one of the more surprising disappointments I've heard this year.  Theoretically,     a meeting of last century's most notorious sludge thrashers and one the most promising groups bringing     experimental metal into the new century should be guaranteed goes-to-11 gold.  Wrong.  The ""Big Band"" runs     through a repertoire of Melvins tunes and songs from Fantômas' most recent release, <i>The Director's Cut</i>.     But the problem here isn't the material; it's the execution.  Chiefly, despite a valiant effort by the     principal players, the sound is so muddy that it's almost as if it was recorded by an audience member;     what energy there might have been is strangled into second-hand perfunctory 'wackiness' and indistinct     bashing.  Even the audience sounds worn out from the tedium by the time this disc clocks out.</p>
<p>The concert starts with the guitar warning sirens of ""Good Morning Slaves"" and seems poised to takeoff,     only to run headfirst into a monolithic wall of cloudy drums (a serious offense when Dave Lombardo and Dale     Crover are on the thrones) and annoyingly non-essential Patton (as he seems throughout) accents.  Even the     good stuff, like the potentially intense rave-up ""Ol' Black Stooges"" and the spooky, just-experimental-enough-to-be-interesting     ""Me and the Flamer"" are stripped of much-needed fire by the bootleg ambience.</p>
<p>It's probably unfair to lay all the blame on Patton for this record, though it's very tempting because: 1)     it came out on his label (more than a year after the actual show, I might add-- when the most noteworthy     thing about a performance is its date, is an album really required?) and Faith No More pension aside, I     wouldn't figure he has lots of room for non-essential discs; and 2) it takes some doing to turn a show with     Fantômas and Melvins into something so, well, lame.  Studio records and boots will have to do until the next     round, which will hopefully include a better mix and something to keep Patton busy.</p></div>"|2987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2987-millennium-monsterwork/|4.9|Dominique Leone

    Anniversary, but I have an acutely sore tummy. Made five-alarm chili
    the other day, with three kinds of beans and many, many hot peppers.
    I think I used too many beans.</p><p>
    
    Three songs have passed on this, the Anniversary's sophomore LP.  My
    belly remains pierced in the throes of agony. I cry to the heavens for
    help, for my incontinence is more than flesh and blood can bear. But
    hark! In this moment of weakness, a revelation! It is no longer the
    nefarious beans, agents of mortal grief, which trouble my guts. My G.I.
    tract faces a new and daunting enemy. Its name: emo.</p><p>
    
    Signed to Vagrant Records, The Anniversary is emo by default. Sharing a
    label with the Get Up Kids, Saves the Day and Dashboard Confessional
    will do that to you. But even if The Anniversary switched over to
    Relapse, they would, without question, still be emo-- it's in their
    blood. Not to mention in their lyrics (from ""The Siren Sings""): ""And
    tonight may never shine/ If you never open your eyes/ I keep this heart
    right next to mine."" This is saying nothing of their music, which,
    while pretending to be candy-coated pop-rock, shares all of emo's
    key indicators, including melodramatic vocal delivery, seamless
    production, and shameless overambition. Did I mention they're
    awfully cute?</p><p>
    
    I've come to realize that this review could consist solely of lead
    singer Josh Berwanger's self-important and unsophisticated lyrics. To
    boot, from ""Husam, Husam"": ""Turn as the earth, and be free/ Weep in the
    well, and be free/ Drink mother's milk, and be free."" Note to reader:
    see <i>supra</i> paragraph two. Drink mother's milk and face the
    consequences. Honestly, there's nothing I could do to make those

    Continuing on, from ""Peace, Pain and Regret"": ""I've known a lot of
    funny people/ The ones who make us laugh/ I've known a lot of lonely
    people/ Calling from the past."" Funny people definitely make me laugh.
    That's a pretty good point. As for all of these lonely people calling
    from the past?  I have no sympathy.  This is why God invented caller ID.</p><p>
    
    Thanks to track nine, ""Devil on My Side"", I am now saddled with diarrhea.
    Like it was on purpose, they follow that up with ""Death of the King"",
    appropriately enough the <i>soundtrack</i> to diarrhea (replete with
    extended-moan fade-out). ""Follow the Sun"" closes the record like it's
    important or something. It's not, really, especially not the wild
    attempt at a cascading, Beatlesque vocal-varnish.</p><p>

    instrumental records, and this <i>Urban Renewal Project</i> compilation is one of many fine steps in their
    rise toward national status. It's also something of a big love-in with Def Jux artists and Scott Herren's
    Prefuse 73, whose sonic fingerprints are all over everything. Which is great, really, not only because
    Herren is the shit but also because he does a good job of tailoring his own sound so that it's flattering
    to other people's-- and because a lot of these guys could do a lot worse than to use his style as a
    jumping-off point for undie production in general.</p><p>
    
    To wit: <i>Urban Renewal Project</i> even starts with a reworking of the Prefuse record's lead track-- only
    this time the radio chatter being cut up has local DJs talking about this very record. There's your premise:
    a manifesto for an implied groundswell, a myth being built of some perfect backpacker radioland of dope
    subway beats and bespectacled hip in gloriously unawkward harmony. Verdict forthcoming.</p><p>
    
    We'll start with the MCs: feel free to scroll down if you only want to know about the Tortoise track. (Go
    on, I'll put it in bold so you won't miss it.) The 'dope subway beats' are courtesy of the Def Jux
    contributors, obviously: first up is Aesop Rock, once again doing the sarcastic tough-talk parody he does
    so bitingly. I'm in love with Aesop Rock, a fan-boy sentiment I hope makes it past our editor. Unfortunately,
    Aesop has Def Jux honcho El-P producing, and while I'll walk admiringly beside that guy's bandwagon, I can
    only listen to so many scrubbed-out, jacked-up beats a week: Aesop needs to stick with Blockhead,
    notwithstanding El-P's production on his own ""Deadlight"" being a highlight here.</p><p>
    
    Chicago's own hip-hop, on the other hand, is less gritty and more vibey, all smoothed-out soul samples and
    sleepy flows. The notable Chicago MC on here is Diverse, last seen by this reviewer trying, unsuccessfully,
    to convince a crowd of indie kids to put their hands in the air. ""Wylin Out"", Chocolate Industries'
    bank-account single, teams him with Mos Def (as in the Mos Def who gets full-page photos of himself in
    <i>The New Yorker</i>) and Herren (who leans straightforward with his beats to accommodate)-- but for a
    marquee single it's actually a bit tepid. He also shows up solo, with the Chicago sound in full effect--
    only there he's swallowing his words and getting disappointingly messy.</p><p>
    
    I have no idea why I like Mr. Lif: he's stiff and hokey like an overenthusiastic Roman Civ lecture, and it
    takes a better beat than the one on ""Wanted"" to distract me from his over-literal and not-as-philosophical-as-he-thinks
    rhyme clunkers. I also have no idea why I'm not digging Souls of Mischief, who sound good here with RJD2 beats--
    beats like little tread-wheeled robots in turtlenecks and berets-- but suddenly they sound weirdly forced
    about their Tribe-style mic-passing.</p><p>
    
    But on to the non-MC tracks, the best of which has Miho Hatori from Cibo Matto gloriously transforming
    herself into the Ashanti of the Chocolate Industries world. Herren's producing once again, casting a
    sprawled-out soul spell like you wouldn't believe. And it sounds great-- it has a vibe, a sunny-stoop East
    Village feel that somehow manages to pull this entire comp together around it.</p><p>
    
    It also acts as the perfect segue into the comp's other indie contribution, this one from <b>Tortoise</b>,
    as part of their surprisingly successful efforts to break around the prevailing mood of ""pfft, post-rock""
    and stay fresh. It's not hip-hop, obviously, but their ""CTA"" fits the aforementioned 'vibe': John McEntire
    drums behind some sunny electro-tone programming, the bass comes in all sprightly, and something new emerges
    from the bubbly fusion bath of <i>Standards</i>-less dramatic groove (more shuffle and slice), and only
    Jeff Parker's guitar seems to have missed the memo detailing this plan.</p><p>
    
    The remaining contributors face the unenviable task of competing with Prefuse in the production game, to
    varying levels of success. That statement excludes RJD2, who turns in the most surprising track here: a
    big, rocky, storm-summoning gallop with string punctuation and guitar tomfoolery. It does, however, include
    While, who loses, and DJ Food, whose abstracted, graffiti-themed instrumental-- something like Squarepusher
    in a crate-digging mood-- is engaging enough to keep one's mind off of that version of ""Radio Attack"" at
    the start. Caural's ""Our Solstice Walk"" is a mixed victory: sighing flutes, warm organs, and more of the
    rainy-day, blissed-out head-nodding that this comp is, in the end, all about.  The beat bulks up into a
    hand-clapping shuffle even as the samples stay downtempo, and it's a beautiful groove even when it feels a
    bit too much like shopping in a designer boutique.</p><p>
    
    The record runs out with a ten-minute appearance for that most deliberately 'progressive' undie axis, the
    Anticon crew: Jel and Dose-One, as Themselves, start off with signature blues-slide languor, lay in a
    lengthy sound experiment of rising hum and chatter, then break out into what's possibly the prettiest and
    most soulful thing on this comp. Which also means that it doesn't quite fit properly-- its opaque, babbling
    murkiness is an odd choice to close out the clean, sparkling precision of Chocolate Industries.</p><p>
    
    And what such label sampler has ever been anything but a mixed bag? What amazes me here is that I'm even
    thinking about this as a unified record, a sturdy and potentially even important one: the Industries seem
    like they're trying to make a case for themselves, and they also seem to be succeeding remarkably. I can
    think of a lot worse things to be nodding one's head to while skimming along on Chicago trains, and so far
    this week I haven't remembered much I own that's significantly better for it.</p></div>"|1862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1862-urban-renewal-program/|8.2|Nitsuh Abebe

By
    this logic, if you can't see yourself listening to an album, say, six months down the line, it may be a
    'good' album you have on your hands, but not a great one, not transcendent, not a classic.</p><p>
    
    I have a problem with this yardstick because many of my favorite works of non-musical art have little 'replay
    value,' so to speak.  Tarkovsky's <i>Andrei Rublev</i> is probably my all-time favorite film, but I just
    don't have what it takes to watch it more than maybe once or twice a year. Likewise, Hans Holbein's painting
    <i>The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb</i> is one of the most affecting works of art I've ever seen. I
    have no doubt of its greatness, but it's not something I'd want hanging in my living room. I'm not saying that
    all art forms should be judged by the exact same criteria-- but why should replay value be so important when
    it comes to music?  Sure, everyone wants the most mileage for their money, but isn't there something to be
    said for one-time-only (or so) art kicks?</p><p>
    
    With this question in mind, consider <i>The Wigmaker in Eighteenth-Century Williamsburg</i> from Miami-based
    sound-rapists To Live and Shave in L.A., a truly great album that, quite possibly, has less replay value than
    anything since <i>Metal Machine Music</i>, though the stakes with this release are considerably lower. If I
    ever put this double-disc set on again it's because I'm playing it for a curious friend, or I've sunk so
    deep into a bout with self-loathing that I want to cause irreparable damage to my nervous system.</p><p>
<i>The Wigmaker</i> sounds as if, somehow, your stereo was broken in such a way that all the radio stations
    on the dial jumped through the speakers all at once. Jarring electronic squalls, squealing oscillators, bass
    rumbling like the earth shifting underfoot, and all imaginable sorts of computer-generated sound, found sound,
    and salvaged radio snippets pile up and stumble over each other, stopping and starting (nearly) at random.</p><p>
    
    Still, there are songs here, of sorts, albeit buried under a mountain of sonic debris. They bear brilliantly
    ridiculous titles like ""Nor Swollen-Bellied Comet Blown"", ""New Poem Dramatized for Lux Cudgel"", and ""Is This
    Good for Vulva?"".  The lyrics, meanwhile, deal in psycho-sexuality, religious hallucinations and nightmarish
    flashbacks to A.P. American History class. Employing language that is purposefully stylized and mannered, it
    reads something like a perverse Lewis Carroll. Here's a sampling from ""When My Rifle Went Sour with
    Preposterous Headdress"":  ""Shit, the house was always Nazarin vibe, cuffs/ An unknown pinfold, fringe whore,
    licking its lips.""  Yeah, I'm mystified, too.  But it makes no difference because you can't make out the
    words, anyway, what with all the racket going on and a vocal style that sounds like a deadpan version of
    Prince.  All you know for sure is that whatever this guy is saying (his name is Tom Smith, by the way), he
    really, <i>really</i> means it, and this is his only way of saying it.</p><p>
    
    Which is exactly why <i>The Wigmaker</i> is a great album.  It is totally convinced of its own necessity and
    is complete in its absurdity. From the perplexing cover art to its utterly indigestible length, there is no
    wink or nudge to suggest this is an elaborate put-on, no window left open to the real world.  To Live and
    Shave in L.A., however, does declare this album ""pre-""music, as distinguished from ""post""-this-and-that
    subgenre classifications.  And yes, it <i>is</i> an absolutely pretentious concept, but I admire Smith for
    making a bold claim and not pussyfooting around.  Plus, true or not, it adds to his completeness and
    conviction.  In a way, he's right: once you get past its admittedly high threshold (it took me about three
    or four attempts to build up the fortitude to make it through more than a few songs in a row), <i>The
    Wigmaker</i> does seem to take on a certain quality of necessity and ""pre""-ness, though I'm not sure where
    one goes from there. Surely not back.</p></div>"|8078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8078-the-wigmaker-in-eighteenth-century-williamsburg/|8.5|Jason Nickey

    his previous, <i>Bayou Paradis</i>. Though released under Varley's G-Man moniker, <i>Avanti</i> follows the
    same pattern as <i>Bayou Paradis</i>-- clinical machine funk for purists. Varley's G-Man pose came to
    prominence with <i>Quo Vadis</i>, the lead track on 1995's <i>G-Man</i> EP.  Seven years ago, <i>Quo Vadis</i>
    sounded to be way ahead of its time.  I found the sparse hypnotic moves that Varley performed to be coolly
    uncomfortable next to my daily rinse-out with Underworld's <i>Dubnobasswithmyheadman</i> and Autechre's
    <i>Tri Repetae++</i>. <i>Quo Vadis</i> was dancefloor functionality at its apogee; its form unmistakably
    followed its function. Varley intended to provide rudimentary syncopation and <i>Quo Vadis</i> delivered
    in an immediately satisfying rush that Richie Hawtin's far brainier Plastikman releases couldn't.</p><p>
    
    Capitalizing on the demand and kudos for <i>Quo Vadis</i>, Varley's G-Man released the full-length <i>Kushti</i>
    (London slang for 'alright' or 'okay'). He roped in former Hawtin collaborator Mark Gage to sequence two
    hours' worth of new and previously released EP tracks into two half-hour long tracks (or 'zones', as the
    sleevenotes called them). At the time, <i>Kushti</i> was the benchmark for minimal techno. Then came
    microhouse.</p><p>
<i>Avanti</i>, like Varley's previous release, <i>Bayou Paradis</i>, conspicuously neglects microhouse, the
    style for which Force Inc has become renowned.  This neglecting of current trends makes <i>Avanti</i> sounds
    either dated or ageless, depending on how charitable a mood you're in.  The steely ""Lollipop"" hovers like
    Vapourspace's ""Gravitational Arc of Ten"" mixed with the furrowing drones of Spiritual High's ""Up!"".  ""Lime
    (Face)"" pulses like a electrocardiogram and ""K.7"" (here remixed by microhouse champs MRI) glowers like a
    petulant and ignored catwalk queen.</p><p>
    
    With a smattering of granulated echoes and chromium flashes, ""Azur"" connects the listener with the
    characteristic grit of Berlin's Basic Channel. But to prevent the cut from becoming a soundtrack to a
    po-faced art installation, Varley stirs get-downs with an irresistible late-80s Chicago jackin' baseline.
    ""Franz Blau"" reinforces my conviction that Varley has never once lost the funk, as an infectiously
    syncopated and mutated cowbell keeps my ass moving despite the song's heavy, whooshing ambience. ""Pistazie""
    contains more electroclash-friendly blips and Linn Drum snap claps than an entire night out with
    Fischerspooner-- but perilous as that sounds, with a solid grounding in the redemptive power of pure Detroit
    techno, ""Pistazie"" never succumbs to imitating Soft Cell.  Elsewhere, Varley comes closest to his LFO past
    with the industrial clank of ""Grape""-- though even that mechanical sound is mitigated by his application of
    a delicate sheen over the abrasions.</p><p>
    
    Though offering no innovation or head-turning, ear-bending moments, <i>Avanti</i> is unmistakably an album
    created by a master of the style. Varley is one of the foremost producers of pure techno.  And while his
    pioneering days may be over, <i>Avanti</i> proves that he's not lost his gift for making soulless machines
    resonant with approximate humanity. It has, however, taken me many listen to get over lamenting Varley's lack
    of experimentation-- I doubt he'll ever try his hand at Detroit-inflected ragatech, which is a crying shame.
    But I now look to the positive aspect: <i>Avanti</i> also demonstrates that Varley seems unlikely to descend
    into nu-jazz broken beat hideousness.</p></div>"|3370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3370-avanti/|7.5|Paul Cooper

    Ladies and gentleman, Knifehandchop has awoken. Spewing raga and atomic gabber madness from the Canadian
    wilderness and sending the hot jams straight down the back of your throat, Knifehandchop has quietly been
    building towards world domination. This kid actually gave Bounty Killer cred, by mixing some of the guy's
    wack-ass rhymes from the <i>Blade</i> soundtrack into his Dhyana Records debut, ""Bounty Killer Killer,"" a
    track so hot it'd make your <i>grandmother</i> throw down on the dancefloor. And it was Knifehandchop's
    copyright-burning, radio smashing ""Dancemix 2000""-- a song that makes Eminem the target of a teen-princess
    gangbang, with samples of Pink, Destiny's Child and the sad little boy from Detroit thrown all over
    fuzzed-out four/four breaks and the Vengaboys-- that got recycled by Kid606 into his latest album.</p><p>
    
    Knifehandchop (aka Billy Pollard) is from the same neighborhood as Venetian Snares and the Tigerbeat6 posse
    (Kid606, Lesser, DJ/Rupture), but probably spends most of his time inside getting high and watching BET.
    And writing some of the phattest boombonic tracks ever heard, too.  But with so much going for him, it's
    sad that only about half of <i>TKO from Tokyo</i>, his second release on the Tigerbeat6 label, is concrete
    proof of it. Comprised mostly of remixes by other Tigerbeat6 artists, <i>TKO</i> is bland in spots and
    brilliant in others, exposing both the strengths and limitations of his sound over the course of seven
    tracks.</p><p>
    
    The opener, ""'Taking the Soul Out of Music' vs 'Vertical'"", mashes up two other Knifehandchop tracks: the
    throaty ragamuffin rhymes of ""Vertical"" cuts seamlessly with the insane raver bounce of ""Taking the Soul
    Out of Music""'s air-raid siren percussion. The track is a fresh reworking of Pollard's material, and its
    sources fare much better than ""Bounty Killer Killer"", which is the subject of two remixes on this record's
    b-side. The first, by Kid606, does little more than pitch-shift and transpose the vocals, eventually slowing
    them to a crawl before the track peters out. The kid also lays down an interesting new drum pattern as the
    track opens, but it doesn't even match up to the vocals, and the whole track ends up sounding like something
    I wrote with Audiomulch drunk. The following remix, this one by DJ Aneurysm, works better, starting off with
    some jazzy hi-hats before morphing into fuzzed-out hip-hop breaks. This is Def Jux territory-- abrasive
    hip-hop structure with an emphasis on the noise-- but it never really takes off. Even Venetian Snares,
    whose contribution ""Not for the Billy"" wraps the source track's synthline around some typical Snares
    crack-your-spine breaks, doesn't get much done.</p><p>
    
    So it's up to Knifehandchop to steer this record out of the sea and headlong into the fleeing masses.
    Aside from the opener, he's responsible for two other tracks. The first, a blunted remix of his newest
    single, ""Hooked on Ebonics"", is a-list party material. Dig that loping bassline, the bling-bling MTV
    catchphrases throughout, the Atari bleeps. Hell, even Ja Rule hollas on this track (that motherfucker is
    <i>everywhere</i>). It's no surprise that ""I Hate Your Fucking Face"", the second of Knifehandchop's solo cuts,
    sticks with the hip-hop-- Knife knows how to bend the genre to his will.  Utilizing elements from the RZA's
    <i>Bobby Digital in Stereo</i> jam ""Domestic Violence"", Knifehandchop constructs a gabber piledriver that,
    after a few listens, sounds downright poignant. A tell-tale piano line, low in the mix, backs a looped RZA
    rhyme (""Your pussy ain't shit/ Your ass ain't shit/ Girl, <i>you</i> ain't shit"") as the drums pound it
    into dust. It's a standout piece, and even as the rest of the record sags and falters, it reminds you why
    you bought the damn thing in the first place: because Knifehandchop is fucking <i>ace</i>.</p></div>"|4496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4496-tko-from-tokyo-12/|6.9|Mark Martelli

From
    morning to night, I was tailed by writers from <i>NME</i>, <i>Mojo</i> and
    <i>Uncut</i>, who shouted questions from fast-moving vehicles about my
    favorite soccer players, who I was dating, and what Joy Division meant to
    me.  I spent a day in Trafalgar Square as part of a photo spread with
    Coldplay's Chris Martin, Travis' Francis Healy, and Placebo's Brian Molko.
    Then they found out that my guitar skills never progressed beyond ""Blister
    in the Sun"" and my falsetto closely approximates the frequency that causes
    everyone within earshot to lose control of their bowels.  Before you could
    say ""Manic Street Preachers,"" my own personal media circus had left town.</p><p>
    
    So I can kinda empathize with the boys of Idlewild, who've had to deal with
    their own fair share of R-head comparisons and Yorkeian accusations.  Never
    mind the fact that the Scottish quartet doesn't sound like anything Radiohead
    has produced since the anthemic days of <i>The Bends</i>; they're from the UK
    (Scotland, to be precise), and that's all that it takes to be thrown into a
    compare-and-contrast table by my limey colleagues.  The superbly named Roddy
    Woomble and his humble bandmates don't want to change the world or open
    peoples' minds to foreign electronic soundscapes; they just want their songs
    to be used in episodes of <i>Seventh Heaven</i>.</p><p>
    
    Because let's get right down to it: Idlewild is a radio band, writing and
    performing pop/rock songs that are negligibly challenging and designed to be
    hits.  Standard Pitchfork policy says I should therefore spend the next 800
    words using my considerable skills in the art of the mock, but you know, I'm
    not really feeling that salty today.  So instead I'll dust off my trusty
    mainstream listening helmet... let's see, I think it's crammed under my bed
    here next to those Soundgarden and Oasis discs I couldn't sell back... there
    it is.  Alright, let the popist perspective commence!</p><p>
    
    Mainstream listening helmet or no, I have to admit that <i>The Remote Part</i>
    contains a lot of potential alt-rock hits, to these ears.  It's one of those
    albums where each and every song could be a single, be it driving guitar salvos
    like ""A Modern Way of Letting Go"" and ""(I Am) What I Am Not"" or purty
    falsetto-slide ballads like ""American English"".  Idlewild also has that
    particular shapeshifting ability to sound like a gaggle of popular bands at
    once, be it Sugar or Matthew Sweet in their more uppity moments, to Wheat
    or occasionally-- and unfortunately-- the (sigh) Goo Goo Dolls when they get
    all sensitive.</p><p>
    
    Thing is, Idlewild are just too good at what they're doing to get out the
    critical brass knuckles.  <i>The Remote Part</i> might strip away a lot of
    the instrumental variety of their last take-home product, <i>100 Broken
    Windows</i>, but even that album was pretty kiddie-pool shallow when it came
    to experimentalism.  Besides, directness suits Idlewild well, be it the taut
    melancholy ""I Never Wanted"", the near-Velveeta-but-not big chorus of ""Live in
    a Hiding Place"" or the top-down abandon of the crunchy ""Out of Routine"".</p><p>
    
    Now you're probably wondering why, if I'm so high on elements of <i>The Remote
    Part</i>, the rating still resides in decidedly lukewarm point-system territory.
    Well, it's not a desperate indie-cred preservation move, honest.  No, really.
    Scout's honor.  The point dockage is due here because the album starts to wear
    thin by the homestretch, with ""Century after Century"" and ""Tell Me Ten Words""
    shooting past my tolerance for drollness.  Blame it on the album being more a
    collection of singles more than a cohesive whole, kind of like Jay-Z's <i>The
    Blueprint</i> (world's first Idlewild/Jay-Z comparison, ding!).  But the fairly
    standard fast-song/slow-song dichotomy of the album has serious luster-degrading
    effects, even over its brief forty-minute runtime.</p><p>
<i>The Remote Part</i> still makes it up to the sunny side of 5.0, however, if
    only because a good third of the album has been stuck in my head throughout the
    rigorous Mitchum listening analysis.  Idlewild falls into that select group of
    rock acts that wouldn't provoke a reflexive stab for the 'scan' button if it
    came on the radio, and I wouldn't be surprised if ""American English"" has already
    hit a few alternative-demographic playlists.  Perhaps it's not an album for the
    more staid, discerning listener (or for those without a mainstream listening

Say no to the devil! Resist the temptation to put your chiseled, contemplative mugs on your album
    cover! See, otherwise, you force consumers to imagine you prepping for the photo-- trimming facial hair,
    arranging jewelry, symmetry-checking your collar, flossing, etc. What are the two Elk Citizens in the back
    supposed to be glaring at with such rock-deepness? Is there an awesome, awesome fern on display just outside
    our view? Are they pretending not to know about the camera, like the accident-injury lawyers whose commercials
    always begin all 'impromptu' while the attorney is mid-study in his library? ""Oh, sorry, hi. Have you or has
    someone you know been the victim of neglect?""</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile: Elk City has tweaked their special blend of 80s and 90s influences to sound like more than a
    murk-rock rehash. In fact, half the material on this release is downright buoyant, with half of <i>that</i>
    stuff approaching the realm of the anthemic. <i>Hold Tight the Ropes</i> ends up being a very diverse record,
    as songs linger, then burst, then echo, then leap, then recoil, then howl, then jaunt.  As Peter
    Langland-Hassan and Renee LoBue call-and-respond, all over the place loom shades of Lou Reed paired up with
    the sometime-vamps of Blondie, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Mekons, Mazzy Star, and Cowboy Junkies. But: this
    mix often doesn't supersede its roots (or its stereo-time competition), leaving the listener with the feeling
    that they've just gorged on some casserole-flavored casserole.</p><p>
    
    The disc gets better as it goes, revealing some interesting dynamics that, methinks, serve as testimony that
    this band ain't yet found itself. For example, Peter sounds a lot more sultry (without trying) than Renee
    (who is trying). I got more: the band is hard to take seriously when they're striking a 'serious' enraptured
    pose, yet when they ease up on the drama they convey legitimate emotion and urgency missing in their
    self-consciously emotive/urgent 'look out, world' offerings.  Therefore, <i>Hold Tight the Ropes</i> gets
    much, much better toward its end, when weighty wanna-bes such as ""Once and For All"" and ""Don't Fight What
    You've Become"" yield to more mundane (and ironically, more effective) songs called ""Football"" and ""K-Mart"",
    both of which boast supernal organs, smooth percussion, and Pavement-toned fuzz-plosion solos.  I'd even go
    as far as to say that ""Summer Song"" is a damn classic, proving that this band <i>can</i> have fun, as they
    call to mind a Bizarro-world radio-ready Sonic Youth.</p><p>
    
    Elk City do their thing well, but even the ho-hum photos of their pedals and equipment remind music junkies
    that this stuff's been done before. I recommend this disc for those iffy days without zeniths or nadirs when
    you can't tell the avatars from the minions. Warning, though: anyone driven crazy by vague ""it""'s that don't
    modify anything had better get ready for lyrics such as ""The way it seemed to go/ It was time."" When it
    comes down to it, it's really what makes it what it is, isn't it?</p></div>"|2751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2751-hold-tight-the-ropes/|6.1|William Bowers

    have to be original to be good' category. Noel Murphy and Tom Hill are two
    guys who more than likely have quite a few Warp releases in their collections,
    but hell, don't we all? After all, you could do a lot worse for musical
    inspiration than Autechre, Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada and Squarepusher.
    Wauvenfold draw from the techniques and textures of each of the Million Pound
    Quartet at various times, but the sound design never falters, and the beat
    programming never fails. So while you've heard something like <i>3fold</i>
    many times before, it sounds nice to put it on again.</p><p>
    
    I'm not being totally fair here, actually-- Wauvenfold have a style that
    rises above mere mimicry. Consistently elevating each of these fourteen
    tracks above the clones are the pair's ear for melody and sense of musical
    humor. Instead of recording and presenting their electronic music as a
    cryptic language informed by experimental mathematics, Wauvenfold are
    inclined to just kick it and have fun. So the choppy hip-hop beat of ""Stab""
    is paired with an overdriven jungle-style bass tone so ridiculously fat
    and deep it seems silly. Barely heard above this all-encompassing bottom
    are some whining horrorcore synths that could be lifted from Dr. Dre's
    production on ""Natural Born Killaz"". ""Stab"" is first-rate cruising music.</p><p>
    
    Further evidence of Wauvenfold's playful nature comes from the versions of
    ""Clip"" that bookend the record. The opening take is a quickie, full of goofy
    fish percussion, power drill hits, and what sounds like a lot of drawers
    being opened and closed. It all happens in such an organized and subdued
    fashion that, when combined with the tinkly keyboard melody, it sounds like
    Romper Room electronica from a school for gifted children. The closing track
    is ""Clip (Clopt)"", recorded live on BBC radio. The pace is quickened by 10%
    while Wauvenfold add all sorts of tweaks. Cartoon drum-n-bass pops back
    into the mix, with exaggerated bass and snare rolls, giving the track a
    slight whiff of genre pisstake, but then the whole thing is so melodic
    and fun it's easy to just stop analyzing and listen.</p><p>
    
    Consistently great melodies are the other thing Wauvenfold has to offer, and
    here's where the BoC comparison is most apt. Tracks like ""Selenium Pulse"",
    ""Pixel Stitched"" and ""Slightlyoutofocus"" (is that a Boards title or what?)
    combine skittery electronic percussion with hazy, dreamlike keyboard
    melodies in a way that gets at the 'comfort in being sad' Cobain sang about
    all those years ago. Given its considerable virtues, it's easy to forgive
    <i>3fold</i>'s slight lack of vision. This album is so stereotypically 'IDM'
    it can almost make you cringe, but the uncomfortable sense of recognition is
    offset by the quality music.</p></div>"|8590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8590-3fold/|7.4|Mark Richardson

    and they're putting the 'rock' back in 'blowing shit up' (in a healthy, non-terrorist kind of way).  Now,
    it's no secret that, when it comes to rock's metal edge, these Queens want badly to be kings; you need
    look no further for proof than 2000's blistering, thuggish <i>Rated R</i>, on which frontman Josh Homme's
    searing guitars and theatrical vocals brought the band close enough to their goal to sniff the <i>fleurs
    de lis</i>.  That, however, is history, and with <i>Songs for the Deaf</i>, the Queens have hit a new peak
    in their development: the sound is more massive, the chaos is more calculated, and with hired gun Dave Grohl
    at the kit, the band has an unprecedented drive that leaves them poised for their strongest bid for power yet.</p><p>
    ""You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire"" embodies the greatest strengths of rock
    at its hardest-- stunning riffs, breakneck speed, and guitars that churn and spit like a threshing machine.
    It's riddled with decades-old metal cliches, but the Queens know what their audience expects, and they use
    this knowledge to continually twist rock stereotypes into a vicious full-nelson until they beg for mercy.
    It's fantastic, and this is just the first track.</p><p>
    ""No One Knows"" changes <i>Songs for the Deaf</i>'s pace by sliding into an easy groove, sleazing its way
    across a dimly-lit bar, half-drunk and reeking of cheap cologne, to put the moves on your girlfriend (or,
    you know, you, depending).  This is four-to-the-floor slime of the highest quality, folks, and it's the
    second installment in this album's triad of genius, completed subsequently by the next track, ""First It
    Giveth"". ""Giveth"" brings the drama like a champ, with Homme singing in pained falsetto over punishing riffs
    during the verses, and opening up into aggro-overdrive for the appropriately apocalyptic chorus.</p><p>
    But along the path to greatness, there are pitfalls, and one Homme often falls into here is the old ""chamber
    of lost souls"" effect (made popular by Alice in Chains on some of their later albums), which he uses to
    fill out the backgrounds of some of these songs.  The multitracked Hommes aaah'ing melodramatically in
    undead unison make slogging through ""Hanging Tree"" and ""Go with the Flow"" a pretty grim endeavor.  It
    doesn't help that these songs churn along interminably long after their riffs have run dry, either.  And
    worse still, the band has quit winking at their metal excesses entirely, toeing the line between mindless
    fun and xFC-metal gothery.  Fortunately, this is only a temporary decline, but that these two tracks hit
    back-to-back in the dead center of the record makes for a much steeper dropoff than if they'd been sequenced
    farther apart.</p><p>
    There's also the issue of the between-song skits.  As skits go, these are pretty tame, but that doesn't
    make them any less obtrusive.  The album even opens with one: the sign-on of KLON (that's ""clone"") radio,
    ""the station that sounds more like everybody else than anybody else.""  It's a broad parody of the Clear
    Channel wavelength empire, and while admittedly pretty fucking funny, the target is a bit obvious--
    especially given that PS2's ""Grand Theft Auto III"" beat them to the punch two years ago and pulled it off
    expertly.  My biggest problem with these interruptions, though, is that they do little for the aggregate
    effect of the album-- after a couple playthroughs, they only serve to stifle the momentum QOTSA manage
    to develop.</p><p>
    Yet, this same biting cleverness also pervades many of the songs, lending an air of spontaneity and plain
    good times-- there's a fake stop in one of the early tracks that's so ludicrous I laughed out loud.  And
    there are even better moments to be had elsewhere: the wavering surf guitar on ""Another Love Song"", or the
    good old-fashioned brain-sickness of ""Six Shooter"" and ""Mosquito Song,"" the latter played lovingly by what
    sounds like the orchestra of the damned.</p><p>
    When these guys are on, it truly is the wrath of the righteous.  However, <i>Songs for the Deaf</i>
    vacillates constantly between soaring heights and mind-numbing lows, making for a true hit-or-miss
    affair.  But even if they can't have it all, the guys do offer as real a showcase of metal-tinged panache
    and stellar songwriting as anyone might hope for from a band labeled 'stoner-rock.'  Besides, if the entire
    album was as strong as the first three tracks, it'd probably burn you alive.  As it stands, Queens of
    the Stone Age settle for attempted murder.  And that ain't bad at all.</p></div>"|6606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6606-songs-for-the-deaf/|7.9|Eric Carr

    shows write new songs despite the fact that they have nothing new to say.  Back in the early 80s, the ill-named
    Manchester band Crispy Ambulance made a minor splash with some singles and one album, <i>The Plateau Phase</i>.
    They were a solid second-tier band, or, to put it in perspective: they didn't make it onto the soundtrack for
    the period flick <i>24 Hour Party People</i>, but they opened for many of the bands that did.  The Ambulance
    were frequently dismissed as Joy Division imitators at the time, but they were also influenced by Magazine
    and, well, Hawkwind.  Honing a post-punk style that included gothically bleak keyboards, quick-strike guitar
    strumming, and martial drumbeats-- plus moody interludes and atmospheric synthesizers which bought them the
    damning 'prog' qualifier-- the boys were signed to Factory Records, but broke up soon afterward.</p><p>
    And now they're back with <i>Scissorgun</i>, their second record after a mysterious 20-year hiatus.  There's
    only one problem: while the Manchester scene may be hot again (catch it now at the local art house!), the
    kids today are armed and preoccupied with boxes of reissues and <i>new</i> post-punk bands like... well,
    have you heard of this band called Interpol?  They're all the rage right now, and frankly, they cop Joy
    Division better than Crispy Ambulance ever did-- or ever will.</p><p>
    But that's not to say that they should be put down like a crippled horse.  These guys sound even tighter
    and more focused than on their early work, and singer Alan Hempsall-- whether you like his voice, or find
    the swagger and intimations of growl off-putting-- also sounds in top form; age hasn't hurt him at all.
    Plus, with production by Graham Massey (808 State, Björk), they've recorded an album that sounds genuinely
    alive: on ""Step Up"", the keyboards blurp and throb like lights when you're speeding through a tunnel,
    while the guitars crank in, dark and foreboding.  ""Slip 'n slide, slip 'n slide,"" Hempsall sings warningly,
    as if he's telling you something important, and bell-like synths chime early-80s-style behind the verse.
    On the next song, album highlight ""Loupgarou"", Hempsall almost sounds giddy with the ""eeeeyyyyyowwww"" that
    he bellows over the generic but exciting guitar lines.</p><p>
    After two tracks, though, there's nothing much to offer.  The album can't escape the problem that felled
    Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's <i>Black Moon</i>, or the one that brought down the Yes retirement fund project
    Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe: the new material doesn't add anything.  It copies their older style, down
    to the last tic and gimmick; they take no risks, and most of the tracks drag.  ""Parallax"" is leaden-- the
    catchy melody gets swamped by turgid guitars-- and the taut repetitiveness of ""Re-animator"" quickly wears
    thin.  They churn through the same template on ""The Drop"" and ""End Game"", plus the two pointless,
    anticlimactic instrumentals that wrap up the album.  Fans may enjoy getting exactly what they expected,
    but this won't have anyone reassessing the band.</p></div>"|1668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1668-scissorgun/|5.7|Chris Dahlen

And I don't just mean asking where the
    bathroom was or where I could find the nearest autobus stop-- I was full into verb tenses and could actually
    understand the soap operas on Telemundo (shocked when it turned out Juanita's baby was actually Raul's).
    This was all in high school, and years of disuse and neglect have made my Spanish skills rustier than a
    Gary, Indiana steel mill.  My vocabulary has dwindled back down to words like 'agua', 'gato', and 'burrito',
    and I'm supremely frustrated looking over the tracklist on this Migala album.  I know I've seen these words
    before, but I can't remember what most of them mean.</p><p>
    
    As it turns out, I don't really have to.  Perhaps as a writer it might be useful, but as a listener, it's
    irrelevant-- these six Spaniards make music that could crush you if you had never known any Spanish at all,
    and on the occasion that frontman Abel Hernandez breaks out his dusty baritone, he does it in heavily
    accented English for the edification of the monolingual majority in the world's largest music markets.</p><p>
    
    This particular album is an odd beast from a marketing standpoint, playing like something of a best-of,
    as the band have taken the time to reexamine their back catalog and give some of it another go.  <i>Restos
    de un Incendio</i> (<i>Remains of a Fire</i>, as in ""ashes""-- love those BabelFish translations) consists
    of songs from the band's first three full-lengths, re-recorded and rearranged by a more skillful, confident
    band.  As a result, it's not as unified or focused as last year's stunning <i>Arde</i>, but it's the boldest
    sounding record they've yet released, and a pretty damn fine introduction to their early work.</p><p>
    
    Whether they're playing instrumentals or vocal songs, Migala's music develops slowly, unfolding in ecstatic
    waves of sound, adding a droning accordion here, a gigantic Sergio Leone guitar there, and building each
    song to a beautiful climax.  The unbelievably passionate guitar work of ""Aquel Incendio"", layered against a
    man's speaking voice that sounds recorded off the television provides what might be the single most wrenching
    piece of music I've heard all year.</p><p>
    
    ""Tiempos de Distastre"" gathers intensity in its opening verses before finally giving way into a drenching
    rush of accordion, drums, cymbals, and wildly strummed guitars that effectively sweeps away all the anxiety,
    before returning you to the final verse, which in turn builds to another rapturous climax.  The somber organs
    that introduce ""Intrucciones Para Dar Cuerda a un Reloj"" recall the elegant melancholy of early Tindersticks,
    before a man's voice intones what sound like a set of instructions in Spanish.  The use of the man's clinical
    cadence only heightens the emotion of the band's playing, as they gently build and recede, ultimately fading
    out.</p><p>
<i>Restos</i> proves the men in Migala to be masters of the melancholy strain and deft tuggers of emotional
    strings.  The only beef I've got with it is that, in maturing skillwise and revisiting their old material,
    the band have lost some of the sonic adventurousness that made <i>Arde</i> so brilliant and effective.  With
    any luck, that'll be back on their next release, and an older, more adept Migala might even top their work
    on that record.  For now, <i>Restos</i> is an entirely worthy new look at where the band has been before,
    and I like what I see.</p></div>"|5278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5278-restos-de-un-incendio/|8.4|Joe Tangari

    running into the same line: ""this is a great album, for a female."" Personally, that sounds a bit condescending
    to me.  After all, isn't it unfair to have one set of standards for males and another for females?  Another
    reason why this is insulting is that the qualifier isn't necessary; Jean Grae may be a little rough, but
    when she spits she can stand toe-to-toe with the best of 'em.</p><p>
    
    Witness ""Love Song"": over a slow and slinky beat supplied by the Beatminaz's Evil Dee, Jean weaves a
    bittersweet tale of one-sided relationships. It's a sensitive, emotionally raw narrative that trudges
    through betrayal and disillusionment. ""I thought it was gold when it was only gold-plated,"" she raps at
    one point.  When the chorus states, ""But this is still a love song,"" you're not sure whether it's
    victorious, resigning or both.  One thing that is certain, though: the track displays an emotional
    honesty and complexity that's rare in any genre, and particularly underground hip-hop.</p><p>
    
    Another lyrical standout on the album is ""God's Gift"", where Jean sardonically affects the voice of a
    misogynist male rap star. Over a string sample, she intones, ""Another day, another hustle/ You're not
    different/ I'm not the daddy to your children... Listen, the only position you fill is pussy gettin'.""
    Two interposed samples serve as the chorus, declaring, ""Bitch, play your position.""  Hearing a female
    spit these typically misogynistic lines is both revelatory and humbling.  It elevates the objectified
    female and gives her a voice, and then spits the offending words back at you like a dagger.  This isn't
    the only place where Jean drops serious knowledge; the song ""Block Party"" is anything but.  Over a cooing
    female vocal sample, Grae paints a bleak picture of asbestos-filled classrooms, virtual ghetto imprisonment,
    and shallow materialism.</p><p>
    
    Considering everything that works on this album, I'd like to give it a higher rating than 6.9. Unfortunately,
    much of the album's production barely reaches mediocrity.  In the liner notes, Jean acknowledges that the
    mixdown is horrible (due to noise-sensitive neighbors) and apologizes for it, but great albums aren't built
    on apologies.  And even if the tracks were better mixed, a good number of her beats still wouldn't pay off.
    There are exceptions, but often the production is repetitive, flat, and generic.  With that said, Grae shows
    a lot of potential.  If she can tweak out her sound a bit, and put a little more effort into her flow,
    she'll shine for years to come.</p></div>"|3538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3538-attack-of-the-attacking-things/|6.9|Sam Chennault

    Farfisy and served up some of the most shyly confident quiet-rock since Yo La Tengo reached their wispy,
    whispery middle age. The album beckoned sweater weather as it sloped and cooed, sounding as though it had
    been recorded in the world's sexiest public library. Their new release, a remix EP whose only flaw is its
    flirtatious length, indentures the soft touch of <i>Know by Heart</i> to huge beats, resulting in some of
    the flat-out whitest hip-hop remnants this side of Third Bass.</p><p>
    
    Let's talk about what remixes say about authorship, about the crises they present. Bands are willing to stick
    their name to material that is technically barely theirs-- in this case, AmAnSet is hocking a project that's
    mostly the work of Her Space Holiday and Morr Music electronicist Styrofoam-- and about half of these
    renderings are so cut-and-paste that there's no central text left to eulogize.</p><p>
    
    So this EP's most obvious misshapen cousin is Low's <i>Owl Remix Low</i>, since it's the most vivid example
    of what happens when tiptoe-core is turned into turbo-bump, and at least three of these 'updates' (as if
    they're meant to replace outmoded originals) are insanely similar to those. The slurred loop of American
    Analog Set's ""Desert Eagle"" matches the Robitussin booyah of Low's ""Anon"".  The overhaul <i>Know by Heart</i>'s
    title track begins as an ethereal, fragile scritch-scratch of vocal samples (a la Tranquility Bass' take on
    ""Over the Ocean"") and bursts into a raving, cyclonic scritch-scratch of vocal samples (a la Jimmy Sommerville's
    take on ""Words"").</p><p>
    
    A recurring motif on the rest of the EP is a 'blown' sound, like equipment failure, that aims to grit up
    American Analog Set's hypoglycemic poppiness. Another golden crutch the disc flaunts is to juxtapose a high
    track of busy, busy drum splatterings over a low track of a straight, time-keeping backbeat. Rather than
    risk being upstaged by its source material's exotic tones, this disc often reduces American Analog Set's initial
    arrangements to ambient or old school three- and four-note twinkles. ""The Postman"" sounds like a street
    brawl between <i>Republic</i>-era New Order, an oscillator, and a caravan of tricked-out Mustangs pumping
    Miami bass.</p><p>
    
    Who knows how well this treat will age? Certainly remix albums rank among my CD collection's Golden Girls,
    or worse, play like bonus features on a wack DVD. But enough textural clashes are chronicled here to keep

It's been nearly a decade since his genre-defining band Uncle
    Tupelo split up, and despite a memorable debut album from his post-Tupelo band Son Volt, the man has long
    skated by on past glories.  With each new album, it's getting harder and harder to justify his continued
    relevance. The last two Son Volt albums, <i>Straightaways</i> and <i>Wide Swing Tremolo</i>, were largely
    monochromatic and lifeless, and that the gravel-voiced Farrar seemed to have run out of things to say and
    has appeared content to dwell upon the same sad-sack mold he'd been carving out for years isn't helping any.</p><p>
    
    Last year, though, he took a step in the right direction. He put Son Volt on hold (possibly for good) and
    released an album under his own name for the first time. <i>Sebastopol</i> was a good idea in theory; all
    but the most hardcore Farrar apologists had to admit it was time for a change, and Farrar did, in fact,
    seem a bit rejuvenated by the sessions. The only problem was with the songs themselves. It's as though he
    thought simply changing his cast would solve the problem-- that he could continue get by on writing the
    exact same songs he's been writing all along. In hindsight, the album comes off as a missed opportunity at
    a fresh start.</p><p>
    
    So how does <i>ThirdShiftGrottoSlack</i>-- a five-song EP essentially made up of outtakes from the ho-hum
    <i>Sebastopol</i>-- reverse Farrar's downward spiral?  Well, it doesn't really. But it does hint that there
    might still be some hope yet. It shows Farrar is at least willing to try something new (again) before he
    jumps back into the relative safety of Son Volt. The results are mixed, but at roughly 20 minutes, it's
    hard to accuse this EP of redundancy, my main complaint concerning Farrar's last couple releases. Taken
    individually, Farrar's songs have always been above par; it's only when one tries to digest 40+ minutes
    worth that they become tedious.</p><p>
    
    The high point here is a Tom Rothrock (Beck, Elliot Smith, R.L. Burnside) remix of ""Damn Shame"", which
    originally appeared on <i>Sebastopol</i>. Although it sounds like a horrible idea on paper, Rothrock loops
    the drums and pumps up a slide guitar to create a smooth, soulful groove that sounds a lot like the
    white-boy funk of Little Feat. Farrar has never sounded less stiff as he hums the melody line, his scruffy
    baritone descending as he sings, ""It's a damn shame, damn shame, damn shame..."" It's exactly what he needs
    right now, to loosen up.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, however, it's Farrar as we've unfortunately come to know him in recent years. ""Greenwich Time""
    is a stripped-down acoustic song that's tolerable only if you don't pay too much attention to vague,
    semi-political lyrics like, ""Ballot box open, temperature rising, and all the cloning nonchalance.""
    ""Station to Station"" (not the Bowie song) is a pleasant enough piano-led track, while ""Kind of Madness""
    (featuring Steve Drozd of the Flaming Lips) is morbidly humorous as Farrar gives a deadpan freak show
    role-call which chronicles (among others) a guy who chops off his arm so he can ""save it for later.""
    Sadly, the song is bogged down by careless lyrics like, ""Stripmalls of road rage are bringing us down.""
    It's the kind of thing I'd expect from recent Ryan Adams.  And ""Dues"" finally rounds out this mixed bag
    with an upbeat rocker colored by slide guitar and organ, which <i>still</i> fails to leave much of an
    impression.</p><p>
    
    Of course, it's too much to ask of an EP to single-handedly turn around the career of a near-legend who's
    fading fast-- <i>ThirdShiftGrottoSlack</i> doesn't even come close. It does, however, hint at the possibility
    that there is still magic left in the man-- just enough of a hint to postpone writing him off completely.
    I'll give you one more shot, Jay.  Just one.</p></div>"|2997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2997-thirdshiftgrottoslack-ep/|5.5|Jason Nickey

Okay, so is a plastic bag
    fluttering around in front of a camera truly a ""tiny miracle in daily life""?  The bag does seem, almost
    inexplicably, to have freed itself from the bonds of gravity, possibly with the aid of something called
    'wind', but I'm pretty sure that doesn't count as a miracle.  Regardless, the pot dealer in <i>American
    Beauty</i> really got choked up on this stuff (and eventually scored with whatshername because of it, so
    what do I know?), and video documentarian Takagi Masakatsu digs on these little wonders, too.  One's
    fictional, of course, but no doubt most of you are more familiar with his work than with Masakatsu's
    real-life video collage, <i>Opus Pia</i>.</p><p>
    
    The fifteen minutes of vignettes from around the world contained in <i>Opus Pia</i> showcase Masakatsu's
    passion to capture the simple beauty of the everyday.  It all smells faintly of patchouli and old Birkenstocks,
    and you may question whether shots of Asian children laughing in the rain or trees racing past a car window
    really constitute the splendor of nature (at least, I did).  Masakatsu, however, doesn't question it for a
    second, and his thoughtful confidence in the understated glory of <i>Opus Pia</i>'s whirlwind is thoroughly
    convincing.  His original score for <i>Opus Pia</i> only enhances the effect by creating a lighthearted but
    contemplative atmosphere in which to more fully appreciate the film.  If only it held up so well on its own.</p><p>
    
    Believe it or not, this isn't a video review-- unfortunately, what's at stake is merely the <i>Opus Pia</i>
    companion CD, and I'm here to tell you that you probably shouldn't waste your money or time.  Naturally,
    as <i>Opus Pia</i>'s original soundtrack, ""Opus Pia"" is the central feature here.  Masakatsu's score is a
    delicate lattice of piano and other tonal percussion, digitally processed until it nearly sounds like
    synthesized tones, though it never fully loses sight of its organic roots.  The composition is truly
    amorphous, fitting brilliantly with <i>Opus Pia</i>'s haze of imagery by offering a sense of narrative and
    connection between scenes, and the electronic air to the score lends a clever point of comparison with the
    predominantly natural scenes upon which Masakatsu focuses.  When the imagery is removed, though, the once
    complimentary composition is reduced to barely more than a formless mire of sound with no underlying
    cohesion.  It's pretty, though, in a vapid sort of way, and appealing enough to briefly overlook its
    free-floating lack of depth.  In fact, the original soundtrack by itself isn't so bad.  The real problem
    is everything else.</p><p>
    
    The next two tracks to pad out the disc are a pair of remixes that are laughably redundant.  The idea of
    'remixing' something that is essentially without form or any sort of developmental impulse is like trying
    to juggle water (it's a stupid analogy, but then, that's sort of the point).   ""Re Pia 2"" demonstrates this
    by sounding almost exactly like ""Re Pia 1""-- which in turns sounds almost exactly like ""Opus Pia"".  These
    are nothing but filler in the most blatant way imaginable.  They do maintain the pleasantly pixilated fog
    of the original, and that's more than can be said for the drippy ""Everything Came From Here"", which sounds
    a little like something Yanni once played at the Acropolis.  The digital editing used to sublimate the
    new-age-y sap of the score into breezy beeps is wholly absent on this track, leaving only heavy-handed
    faux-emotional piano.</p><p>
    
    And then there's ""Harmony"".  ""Harmony"" is simultaneously the best and worst of this CD, and as such, it's
    hard to come to grips with.  Masakatsu's travels have obviously provided him with a wealth of sonic baggage
    from the locales he's frequented, and he's finally gotten around to unpacking his suitcases.  These fragments
    of indigenous noise, the backdrop of everyday life, are assembled into a 28-minute travelogue of just
    background: cars, wind, passing conversations, etc.  It's as good as any of the truly ambient noise work
    out there, and slightly ingenious with regard to Masakatsu's vision.  It certainly does bring prominence to
    the constant hum of everyday life that so many of us take for granted.  But... it's 28 minutes of
    unspectacular noise, and more than any other track present, it takes a great deal of work to appreciate,
    for better or worse.</p><p>
    
    So much work, in fact, that you might not have the strength to wade through to the final (and only marginally
    impressive) track, ""And Then...""  Not that you'd be missing anything you didn't already hear on ""Everything
    Came From Here"".  In all, this is mainly an album of ideas, not music.  'Harmony' is more impressive to
    consider than actually listen to, and similarly, the soundtrack is wonderful-- as long as it's heard in
    conjunction with the film.</p></div>"|5128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5128-opus-pia/|4.6|Eric Carr

It shouldn't work.</p><p>But it does.  Perfectly.  And it's all because of the enthusiasm and sheer joy that electronic artist Max     Tundra (né Ben Jacobs) puts in every note of his second album, <em>Mastered by Guy at the Exchange</em>.     Jacobs comes across like a dry, witty Englishman mixed with a three-year-old on a slowburn sugar high.  He     seizes every strain of pop music and every instrument he can think of, wrapping them in layers of synths     and drum programming.  He namechecks a Yes album on one song, so it's not surprising when he overdubs     himself into a Rick Wakeman who has eight hands and good taste; the flurry of keyboards on ""Fuerte"" blows     through like a swarm of candy-coated insects.  Which isn't to ignore the subtleties of the accordions,     guitars, trumpets, and other live instruments mixed into the album-- all of them played by Jacobs himself.</p><p>Genre-hopping may be old hat by now, but Jacobs' music is so disorienting that the abrupt cuts on, say,     ""M.B.G.A.T.E."" are still startling and bizarre: where did that club beat suddenly come from, and what's     with the horns?  But there's another reason he keeps catching you off-guard: Jacobs is ostensibly writing     pop songs.  Under all the chaos, these songs are straightforward and brutally catchy, just about every one     of them anchored to a great hook and an intriguing voice.</p>
<p>Jacobs' first album and singles were instrumentals, but here, all but one of the tracks has vocals-- mostly     by Jacobs, whose high, mellifluous voice resembles Scritti Politti's Green Gartside or, uh, Prince.  But he     also invites his sister, Becky, to sing.  No offense to Ben's work, but where his voice fits into the music,     Becky's soars on it; though not exactly a diva in power or emotional range, she has an attractive voice that     adds the right amount of warmth to the electronics.  ""Lysine"", the first single, starts with just her and     the most basic possible melody before Ben gradually adds glitches and stuttering keyboards; and she's     beautifully nimble singing the arching melody of ""Acorns"", overdubbing her own harmony while Ben adds a     shuffling rhythm track and airy (well, weak-lipped) brass.</p>
<p>Since this is his first time as a lyricist, it's forgivable that Jacobs' words aren't as striking as the     music.  He confesses, ""I only sing about things that happen to me/ I never learned to fill my songs with     allegory,"" and it's true that the songs aren't rich with subtext.  But the music's already so busy that     it all works out fine-- you don't jam a drumstick in a turkey club sandwich-- and anyway, the unassuming     way he writes about himself is fun.  It's great, for example, that the song ""Gondry"" is just a plea to     videomaker Michel Gondry (Björk, Radiohead, Massive Attack) to direct one for him.  Or that his other verses     are so autobiographical-- girls he's loved or loves, complaints about his day jobs-- all strewn with Britpop     references and clever rhymes.</p>
<p>But more importantly, he knows how to mesh the words with the music, texturally-- he has a good ear for     words and rhymes-- but also narratively.  The last track, ""Labial"", is practically an aria.  The lyrics     follow a simple hopping melody, telling the story of how Jacobs stole his best friend's girl.  Bonus points     to Ben for having his sister sing it, making it sapphic.  The music dramatizes the words-- much like he'd do     with an orchestra, he uses different tonal colors to underline different lyrics-- but here it's the acoustic     strumming on the first verse, the giddy keyboards on the next few, and then the abrupt cut to a gnarly,     grinding electric guitar.  After the bridge he fades to a low, pulsing bassline that underscores the     conclusion, and then the music explodes in a wave of keyboards, a massive stretch of sustained chords,     making a finish so big, it's this close to being raw, stinking cheese.  Yet, its boldness and, if nothing     else, utter uniqueness, is what makes it so beautiful.</p>
<p>And that may be the key to the album's success: that it can take the unfamiliar and the over-the-top and     tie it to what's recognizable, hitting normal targets with the most creative means Jacobs could imagine.     This record shows the breadth of his creativity, yet it's accessible, catchy and brilliantly simple. A     massive achievement.</p></div>"|5160.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5160-mastered-by-guy-at-the-exchange/|9.3|Chris Dahlen

In a world where
    the general populace would consider the records that make Pitchfork's year-end top 20 obscure, a band that,
    after ten years and six studio albums, fails to receive props even from slapdash websites like ours begins
    to redefine and reshape the term 'unknown.' So it goes with Idaho, one of the more underappreciated 'great'
    indie bands in America today. And, just like all the others, Idaho's entry in the unreleased comp-camp was
    simply a matter of time.</p><p>
<i>We Were Young and Needed the Money</i> is 60 minutes and 17 songs of unreleased Idaho material. In theory,
    every review of a compilation like this could be a positive one: if the compilation is packed with wholesome
    goodness, the artist receives accolades as one with the Midas touch; if the compilation is a shit-sink, the
    artist could be heralded for exercising restraint and discernment on his full-lengths and saving the dreck
    for a singular, catchall dumping session.</p><p>
    
    To borrow from Gump, <i>We Were Young and Needed the Money</i> is like a box of chocolates-- though more a
    Whitman's sampler than a delectable selection of Lindt, as sometimes you get the ambrosial, luscious pleasure
    of that nugget with the caramel and the nut clusters in it.  On <i>We Were Young</i>, these lip smackers come
    early on-- notably the first six tunes, including ""Teeth Marks"", an ethereal alterna-rocker recorded in 1995,
    and ""Flat Top"", another hard-rocking entry that puts lead Idahoan Jeff Martin's feedback guitar and production
    talents to ample use.  Conversely, <i>We Were Young</i> does feature some significantly bland, backloaded
    shortcomings, even if the record never delivers a slab of repulsive pink-nougat, or 'cherry-in-the-middle'
    surprise.</p><p>
    
    The style on ""Teeth Marks"" characterizes the feel of the entire album; most of the material was recorded
    before 1999, when Idaho was still a true-to-form rock 'n' roll act. Thus, like the aforementioned ""Teeth
    Marks"", ""Come Over"", an overdriven, mid-tempo, bitter and bluesy track, would feel right at home on <i>Three
    Sheets to the Wind</i> or <i>This Way Out</i>. Sad rockers beware, however; there's nothing on <i>We Were
    Young</i> approximating the delicate, glowing slowcore found on Idaho's last two studio discs, the brilliant
    <i>Hearts of Palm</i> and the highly enjoyable <i>Levitate</i>.  This stuff is mostly Martin with his
    full-band Idaho posse of old.</p><p>
    
    With all the strong tracks up front, though, the disc's tail end suffers somewhat: the dull melody on the
    downtempo ""A Second Chance"" is a good example of a wise omission from a full LP. ""Stayin' Out Front"" has
    its charms, including a conga drum/arpeggiated guitar bridge and some sampled, distorted vocal parts, but
    fails to come together as compellingly as Martin's strongest work.  And the drab baritone delivery and
    hackneyed lyrics on ""Drown"" are a pretty ill-advised way to close out the album.</p><p>
    
    Still, <i>We Were Young and Needed the Money</i> stands as a worthwhile purchase for fans of the band, even
    if, in terms of a starter album, it understandably lacks the stylistic diversity, top-shelf songwriting and
    exceptional studio polish of some of Idaho's proper albums.  In short, a Whitman's mix of the Midas touch
    and the discerning song selection, with the decided edge going to Midas.</p></div>"|4056.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4056-we-were-young-and-needed-the-money/|7.5|Brad Haywood

It's an instrument that's been in use for hoary centuries,
    but one that ran out of new territory sometime around the mid-70s.  I'm not saying the trumpet has lost
    its usefulness in today's musical environs, but as far as new voices and sounds go, the old brass horn
    seems pretty tapped out, with only the rare blowhard able to break free from the usual comparison glossary:
    smoky film noir soundtracks, the six or seven phases of Miles Davis, and Bacharachian flugel-syrup.  In all
    likelihood, a reviewer at Jazzfork.com is saying the exact same thing about the guitar right now, but hey,
    that's relativism for you.</p><p>
    
    Not that Andy Diagram, hornman for Merge duo Spaceheads, doesn't give instrument resurrection the old
    college try.  Virtually every sonic character the trumpet has ever assumed makes an appearance on <i>Low
    Pressure</i>, from scratchy archival footage sputtering toots to fusion-era wah-wah squawks to
    legion-of-overdubbed-Diagram big-band recreations.  It's an impressive encyclopedia of trumpet sounds--
    which is why it's all the more disappointing that they're not put to very many compelling uses.</p><p>
    
    Because Spaceheads has a clinical case of technophilia, a distracting over-dependence on loops, electronics
    and programming pervades <i>Low Pressure</i>.  And thanks to the trumpet at center stage, it's hard to
    classify the twosome as anything but a jazz act.  But if nothing else, at least they're a jazz act trying
    desperately to update the form by soldering in some serious laptop percussion.  Maybe blame can be placed
    on the fact that the album contains three remixes (two co-manipulated by drummer Richard Harrison), but all
    too often, the machinery overwhelms the humanity, anime-style.</p><p>
    
    This effect is most notable with ""On a Clear Day,"" where Harrison and co-remixer Mick Routledge pile on
    layer upon layer upon layer of percussion track to build up a dense club grind lacking all but the barest
    of melodies; the result is intriguing, if not unforgettable.  Melodic droughts are the biggest shortcoming
    of Spaceheads, as Diagram prefers slow slides and harmonized blasts to repeated themes and discrete note
    packages.</p><p>
    
    The duo obviously prioritizes texture over songcraft-- a noble calling, to be sure-- but the
    environments created don't have the consistency to sustain the album.  <i>Low Pressure</i> features too many
    jarring moments to be ambient (like the almost guitar-like trumpet slashes of ""Storm Force"") and too many
    drawn-out contemplative segments to be a groove session (see the 10-minute long synth swells and arrhythmic
    rattlesnake maracas of ""Red Shift""-- not my cup o' ambient tea).</p><p>
    
    Occasional successes show up to the party, like the beach-cop TV theme songs set amongst sinister electronics
    of ""The Lugano Affair"" and ""The Hut"", with its uncustomary focus on a single groove throughout.  But most
    tracks simply stretch too long and change gears too often to hold interest or stake out long-term memory
    territory, coasting along in a low-pixel blur that obfuscates where one track ends and the next begins.
    Even while Spaceheads' aims don't necessarily jibe with my listening preferences, it's apparent that
    the content of <i>Low Pressure</i> is inferior to same-ballpark artists like Isotope 217 and Chicago
    Underground Duo.  The trumpet might yet be revived from its current state of throwback purgatory into
    newfound relevance, but Spaceheads don't seem to be the act holding the defibrillator.</p></div>"|7388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7388-low-pressure/|5.3|Rob Mitchum

""Jazz is dead as     a popular art form,"" was the comprise I agreed to, wincing all the while, in a recent exchange with a     conscientious objector.  I'm not sure I totally agree with that statement, but it was the only way to     make my point of jazz's continued relevance without conceding that it is, at best, an interesting sideshow     to the popular, rocky main attractions.</p>
<p>Yet, jazz is vibrant, as long as you're willing to flip past the <i>Billboard</i> top 40 jazz records and     delve into the 'marginal' sides of truly new music.  The biggest problem I see with jazz is not in its     unfamiliarity to most rock listeners, or even with the art's own hardliner traditionalists (paging Mr.     Marsalis, Mr. Marsalis, please pick up a white courtesy phone)-- the greatest hurdle for jazz is that it's     seen as antiquated, eccentric dinner party music; something to take a few samples of so it can make your     record collection look nice, and prove that you ""gave it a chance.""</p>
<p>That's a shame, because a lot's happened to jazz since <i>Kind of Blue</i> and <i>A Love Supreme</i>.  In     the case of Otomo Yoshihide, you might even be hard-pressed to call it 'jazz' at all.  Where the crusty old     regime might lead you to believe that swing beats and long, wanky sax solos were required, this incredible     Japanese experimentalist forgoes the traditional for the extreme, post modern and ironic.  In many ways,     Otomo is similar to American John Zorn, though rather than flighty sax skronks and hardcore backdrops, he     favors the turntable, the guitar, and the raw, romantic impressionism of free jazz.  Of the literally     hundreds of releases he's been involved with, the most famous was his legendary avant-rock collective     Ground Zero (sort of a more colorful, Japanese version of Zorn's Naked City).  His New Jazz Ensemble, which     plays here, features many of the same musicians, but makes a jazz noise where GZ rocked.</p>
<p><i>Dreams</i> is Yoshihide's second record with his jazz band, though the first was billed as the New Jazz     Quintet.  The first record saw Yoshihide struggling to strike a balance between modern electronic     improvisation and traditional hard bop.  This one is altogether different, most notably due to the presence     of female vocals, provided by Phew and Togawa Jun.  Phew is no stranger to fans of experimental Japanese     music, and her earthy voice turns many tunes that would be straight-ahead jazz ballads into introspective     tone poems.  Jun, meanwhile, doesn't quite possess Phew's command of atmosphere, but adds a less weighty     compliment to the music nonetheless.</p>
<p>Tunes like ""Yume"" and ""Good Morning"" are gentle ballads, and help make a case for 90s extremists like     Yoshihide being more than just noisemongers.  On the latter, trumpet, sax and guitar accompany Phew's     vocal, often leaping into boisterous, atonal solo figures, though never overpowering her frontline melody.     ""Yume"" begins with a childlike trumpet introduction, keeping an omnipresent sine wave in the background,     and ushering in the flute, guitar and saxophone.  Phew again delivers a well-worn vocal here, but instead     of being a vulnerable ballad, the song reaches near-epic heights of post-rock torch song.  Her more     aggressive side can be heard on ""Hahen Fukei"" and the amazing ""Teinin Pushiganga"", but her voice seems     tailored for the calm before the storm.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the record is a mammoth, 16-minute version of Jim O'Rourke's ""Eureka"", featuring Jun and     Phew.  The song begins as a bawdy funeral march, but quickly returns to the familiar ballad strains of the     earlier tunes.  However, about five minutes in, the sound of waves crashing on a beach take over, and soon     the sine wave returns.  When the vocals re-enter, free percussion and bass, and double-tracked saxophones     playing the melody join them.  The ensemble crescendos to a fiery climax that sounds completely in the     tradition of post-<i>Ascension</i> free jazz.  Yoshihide's band, following the hallowed jazz model of     reinterpretation, has taken music seemingly outside their realm and played it like it could never have     belonged to anyone else.  It's this kind of creative ambition (and the ability to pull the music off) that     should inspire non-believers to take a closer look at new jazz.  It's as good as it ever was.</p></div>"|8860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8860-dreams/|8.3|Dominique Leone

    that time travel doesn't exist as a human technological capability.  This being overwhelmingly the case, I
    will try my best to transport with words, and paint a picture of another time-- a time ever so slightly
    more innocent, when terrorism wasn't being used as an excuse to crush civil liberties and drop bombs on
    mustachioed megalomaniacs.  So, drag that bottle of Orbitz out of the back of the closet, put <i>X-Files</i>
    on the VHS, and journey back with me to the year 2000.</p><p>
    
    It was a wondrous time-- we were still fascinated by the three zeros that had signified the birth of the
    new millennium, and many were relieved to have escaped judgment from an infinite, intangible being.  Then,
    toward the end of the year, we began to hear rumblings from the many-headed hydra of UK rock journalism
    that some amazing new music had come to usher us into the New World.  This music was deemed fascinating,
    uncompromising and utterly prizeworthy by our English brethren, who spoke in hushed tones of how it was
    to be the coming of ""the next Radiohead,"" or perhaps more tellingly, ""the next Travis.""</p><p>
    
    This new music was produced by a band of four affable blue-collar lads from Europe's island neighbor who
    called themselves Coldplay, and before you knew it, there was no escaping their lead-off single, ""Yellow"",
    as it burned itself into the national consciousness via extensive radio exposure and ABC promotional spots.
    I, myself, was never too taken with that single, though I openly admit to enjoying the album it was culled
    from, <i>Parachutes</i>.  It was innocuous, to be sure, but it was also honestly rendered, and the opening
    three songs, effortless and hummable as they were, were hard to deny.</p><p>
    
    Two years and a veritable avalanche of press later, <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> has Coldplay taking
    a second shot at it, and to be perfectly honest, what they throw at the wall doesn't stick quite as well.
    I will credit them where it's due: they've admirably eschewed cloning their debut album, a path that would
    have been all too easy to take given that record's critical and commercial success.  But while the sound of
    this album is more expansive, the influences a bit less obvious, and the approach more varied, the guys
    forgot to tote along their initial strength: the songs.</p><p>
    
    Atmospherically, a couple of these tracks are remarkable-- particularly ""Daylight"", with its swooping guitar
    and synth lines.  Even its strings, which echo melodies from Suede's last album, lend a sense of drama to a
    song that otherwise wouldn't hold much.  Midtempo non-rockers ""Green Eyes"" and ""Warning Sign"" stretch the
    most obvious thread back to <i>Parachutes</i> with their lovelorn lyrics and slightly more developed
    melodies.  And there are also a couple of ""memo to listener: we can rock, too!"" moments, specifically ""A
    Whisper"" and the lite-apocalypse of opener ""Politik"".  The latter essentially takes the blueprint of
    ""Yellow""-- namely, the slamming, repetitive strumming of clean electric guitar-- and builds a more spacious
    song from it, one with more rattle and hum, but less melodic substance.  Martin's double-tracked vocals
    hover curiously low in the mix and the band thrashes earnestly, but all the listener really comes away with
    is a nebular dustcloud and the sense that Coldplay want to break out of their box.</p><p>
    
    Part of the blame for moments like these rests on producer Ken Nelson, who doesn't seem to know what to do
    with the band's expanded sound this time out.  He alternately dries up the quietest passages and drenches
    the louder sections with Martin Hannett-sized reverb tides.  It takes a lot of discretion to handle that
    sound, and the folly of Nelson and the band (who co-produced) often comes at the expense of the vocals,
    which frequently get lost in the haze.</p><p>
    
    And that's a shame because vocalist Chris Martin has improved since the band's not-so-humble beginnings--
    his voice is dramatically fuller than in the past, and he falters less on the higher notes.  But, of course,
    he's still far from foolproof: at times, his attempts to broaden his palette don't pan out, such as during
    the regrettable midsection of ""Clocks"", where he barely bothers to add a melody to the central lyric ""nothing
    else compares.""  To his credit, he does manage a pretty good verse melody here, but then he oddly shies
    away from what <i>should</i> be the hook at the end, tentatively trailing off as though he's not sure it's
    good enough.</p><p>
    
    That could very well be the case, too, as it's been widely posited that Coldplay nearly didn't make this
    album at all, fearing that they didn't have the depth to provide an adequate follow-up to their debut. I'll
    avoid the obvious cheap shot there and instead offer that they indeed still might.  <i>Parachutes</i> proved
    that Coldplay have at least a nascent songwriting capability, and <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> shows
    them testing themselves musically, so it seems logical that if their third album were to combine those
    strengths they might finally start to sound like the band the UK press is always going on about.</p><p>
    
    After over a half-dozen listens, I still haven't taken anything away from <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i>
    (by contrast, I recognized <i>Parachutes</i>' ""Don't Panic"" for the relatively tight song it is after hearing
    it once), and my girl, who was much more a fan of <i>Parachutes</i> than I was, sums it up as ""boring.""
    She's pretty much got it right.  Coldplay may claw their way back from this, but it'll be a pretty steep
    climb.</p></div>"|1538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1538-a-rush-of-blood-to-the-head/|5.1|Joe Tangari

People pay to be at his shows so they can shout
    insults at him; reviewers have written of their desires to smack him around.  I'll readily admit that he's
    flung some inscrutable splorp into record store bins, and that he needs to have that Pubescent Perry Farrell
    DNA extracted, but his last two unctuous, rewarding freak-outs, recorded under the guises of Owls and now
    Friend/Enemy, lead me to ask: what does Kinsella have to do for people to take his afflicted noise seriously?
    Commit suicide? Be Japanese?</p><p>
    
    In addition some of his usual collaborators from Owls, Cap'n Jazz and Joan of Arc, the twelve contributors
    to <i>Ten Songs</i> include members of Califone, Need New Body, and 90 Day Men, among other acts. The story
    is that Kinsella and Joan of Arc's Todd Mattei first developed the vocals and guitars, and then the rest of
    the merry ol' gang were brought in to add coils of organ, banjo, drums, pedal steel, bass, marimba, etc.
    Look ma, four pianists!</p><p>
    
    Even without prior knowledge of the project's genesis, listeners can deduce that this album is a collision
    of premeditation and improvisation, of composed pieces and spontaneous seizures, of the ripe and the rotten.
    Every libertine musician here is destroying the village in order to save it, and the resulting songs contain
    mega-spectrums whose shambles hunch beside their pristinery-- imagine Gastr del Sol with a mean low end.
    Festering chords (weird, open, and minor) bulge from capillary riffs-- imagine Mick Turner overdubbing Slint
    while a toddler twiddles the pitchshifter.  The feedback on ""Cough Soft Cock Rock/How Do You Explain Me to
    Your Mom"" seems manufactured from something organic under duress, maybe the old slats of a marina creaking.
    The drone, strum, and keys of ""Out at the Inner (Dark)"" blend impossibly with clamorous drum rolls that
    sound studio-years away.</p><p>
    
    I could go on and on about how willingly and edifyingly this music can dovetail, collapse, and spaz, how
    Zappatrocious it is, how jawdroppingly the organs roam, how the upbeat moments sound like Canned Heat with
    botulism, or about how the escalating jazz-punk of ""I'd Rather Be High Than Get Laid/Fucked Any Day of the
    Week"" is flat-out bitchin'. But that'd overlook how the lyrics step up as well, imagist and longing. ""Teeny
    Comealong"" ends with a propulsive catalog of discarded standards: ""Feeling is too easy/ Leaving is too easy/
    Quiet is too easy/ Esteem is too easy/ Dead is too easy/ Easy is too easy/ Jealousy is too easy/ Friends is
    too easy/ Keeping is too easy/ Responsibility is too easy/ Escaping is too easy/ Ending is too easy.""
    Absurdists can only laugh so long until the horror paralyzes them, and lemme just say that Kinsella's ripped
    yelp of ""I hate my thin top lip!"" during ""Do the Stand on the One Foot Dance to the Radio Rodeo"", for all
    its superimposition, puts the faux-trauma of Bright Eyes' photo-opera to shame. One gets the feeling that
    Kinsella couldn't give a green damn about his haircut.</p><p>
    
    Friend/Enemy is not so much a step back from Owls as it is a cryptic lope away. And yes, there are some
    wince-worthy moments (a friend, proving the abundance of haters, described it as ""extravagant crap""). But
    the band's failures are failures of restraint, not of imagination. If you come to this website to find out
    what Ryan Adams is up to, this crotchety album's not for you. <i>Ten Songs</i> is the opposite of pop. Pop
    strives for frozen moments, not this album's long thaw. Pop's a pacifier, offering us an unremarkable
    assortment of distractions from death; this album is excited about decay.  <i>Ten Songs</i> isn't a
    demographic-making commercial for anything; it's a distillation of uncanny arrangements with almost no
    sense of audience. Hell, the last time I saw Kinsella live, he mini-lectured about the Middle East while
    the crowd called him gay and unemployed.</p><p>
    
    This stuff's what plays in the lobby of a unicorn abortion clinic, except for the almost traditionally pretty
    but equally complicated ""Just Like Ann E. Fay's Blues"" and ""Okay We'll Fade Before the End"" (despite its
    lame Phil Glass redunda-vox).  I have to love an album whose opener breaks with since-the-60s tradition and
    ""recognizes the authority of the clouds before the sun.""  Now that the fashion-fucks have claimed rock and
    roll, you almost have to wander this far out to lose your shit.</p></div>"|3200.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3200-ten-songs/|8.3|William Bowers

    Zurich-based synchronized swimming team, Seelenluft's lone operator Beat Soler took himself off to Los
    Angeles.  As numerous portrayals have documented, L.A. is one helluva bizarre place. From Nathaniel West's
    <i>The Day of the Locust</i> to David Lynch's <i>Mulholland Drive</i>, the city has proven itself the
    world-leader in disturbing fakery and creepy superficiality.  So you'd think L.A. would be Soler's kind of
    town, seeing as how he often adopts the persona of a trumpet-playing bunny/human hybrid called Silvercity
    Bob.  <i>Out of the Woods</i>, however, with a couple of exceptions, is a rather conventional downtempo
    offering.</p><p>
    
    The album begins with a paean to the female residents of the city. ""L.A. Woman"" is not a cover of the Doors'
    lugubrious drivetime staple, though Soler's song has similar ambivalence towards its subject. In contrast to
    the underwhelming opening track, the second, ""Manila"", is as unexpected as an honest cop stationed in Rampart.
    Apparently, Soler found the song's guest vocalist while walking the sun-kissed, cap-dappled streets of
    Compton. Yes, a white Swiss man in a bunny suit would have walked free and easy, with nary a care in the
    world, through zones abandoned by all but the Bloods and the Crips. Perhaps the gang members recognized
    Soler's Swiss neutrality and allowed him uninhabited passage, or maybe he was really being a door-to-door
    salesman, offering Compton's residents a great deal on a new cuckoo clock.</p><p>
    
    Whatever his true purpose, Soler
    did discover 12-year-old Michael Smith, who provides ""Manila"" with his atrocious-but-utterly-charming
    mic skills.  The kid clearly can't rap-- he has fits instead of flow-- but he does have charisma.  His
    spoken word bit about being on a plane bound for Manila and asking for curried chicken as the pilots lose
    control is delivered in a series of herky-jerky inflections and with enormous relish.  You can hear how
    proud he is of himself-- especially when he nearly shouts that, whilst in tailspin, he encourages all the
    passengers just to dance. His enthusiasm and joy-in-the-face-of-peril is truly remarkable-- and that Soler
    chose to include this unique song (and release it as a 12"" single with a feisty Manitoba remix) proves, if
    nothing else, that he knows when he's on.</p><p>
    
    The remaining ten tracks unfortunately fail to build on Smith's exuberance.  The upright bass and vibraphone
    of ""Echokiller"" immediately connect the listener with Seelenluft's <i>Synchronschwimmer</i> EP, but the song
    lacks the kitschy glee that pervaded that record. Each time Soler and his Silvercity Bob Orchestra repeat the
    head, it sounds more and more labored. When Soler steps up to his Rhodes to take a solo, it's more like a
    talented amateur comping than a meaningful elaboration on a musical theme.</p><p>
    
    ""Air Condition"", bucking on a series of perpetually breaking beats, stabilizes somewhat when guest vocalist
    Lara Stuart delivers Soler's equating of a relationship cooling-off with the efficiency of her recently
    overhauled 4000 BTU Trane window unit. Orchestra member Christian Fischer resurrects the tenor sounds of
    that ancient instrument, the transverse flute, for ""Boobsie and Pepsy"". Lacking any real substance, this
    instrumental is only noteworthy because of that breed of flute's slightly irregular appearance. A very
    youthful (and probably highly Botoxed) 83-year-old introduces ""Dancing Grandma"". Soler takes the sine-wave
    bass and almost-two-step percussion patterns of DJ Zinc's ""138 Trek"" and adds dapples of Rhodes piano.
    Again, in contrast to ""Manila"", the track is unremarkable.</p><p>
    
    When Lou Barlow made his move out west, he summed up his ambivalence to L.A. with the processed vocals of
    ""E.Z.L.A.""  Soler took note of Barlow's trope and processes Christian Fischer's vocals on ""Piano J"". The
    result is as blatant a knock-off as the Kate Spade handbags sold on street corners. Despite beginning
    promisingly with analogue filth, ""The Evil Frog"" soon lapses into familiarity when Soler cut-and-pastes a
    preacher's sermon on the reach of Satan and the money's power to corrupt.  Much of this is righted, though,
    when Soler cut-and-pastes the gorgeously alien voices of a duo called the Saigon Sisters into the upright
    bass and vibes of ""Yoa Gongla"".</p><p>
<i>Out of the Woods</i> is a pretty big disappointment for me. I've adored Seelenluft's previous releases
    and imagined him to be one of the few acts that would push downtempo away from the conservative humdrum of
    mass-market Chill-Out Lounge comps.  But this album leaves no one satisfied: the Dido and Moby massive will
    find it too awkward for dinner table background music, and those of us who desire more innovation will find
    it simply lacking in distinction.</p></div>"|7061.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7061-out-of-the-woods/|5.6|Paul Cooper

    Everyone likes to skip down to the corner record shop, pocketful of chore money and gaze at the strange,
    thrilling new titles with the colorful jackets.  Oh, what a time we have gazing at the covers that must
    have come from halfway across the world to excite us in the music shop.  And when we select our favorite
    one from the never-ending stack of delights, handing over the hard-won money from a month's worth of gutter
    rinsing and pipe-hosing, and take home our prize, there is no warmer satisfaction than to hear the magical
    melodies from the disc fill our rooms with sweets and light.</p><p>
    
    But wait, not every record is there for us to enjoy.  Some records-- usually the ones with the shifty
    computer images and decadent coloring-- only deign to scare us.  These records, they weren't made to fill
    our rooms with smilies, but with headaches and contradictions.  Why did the record store offer these, when
    there were plenty of nice records to choose from?  I recently brought one by this Brendan Walls home, and
    let me tell you, it's not something to play for normally happy people.  It's full of very angry noises and
    mechanical screw-ups.  Well, it is!</p><p>
    
    And then, here's what I found out about this Walls character.  Apparently, he's from Australia, where I
    understand people walk on their hands and eat hamburgers for breakfast.  It makes sense, because everything
    about this music seems backwards!  Brendan Walls makes his music using only instruments and electronic
    gadgets that he created himself.  So, you won't hear any orchestras or harmonicas on this record.  The
    boy at the record store said that I shouldn't buy this unless I already liked some other weird people like
    O-to-mo Yoshy-someone, or a lot of guys from Germany who use computers to make songs that sound like they
    don't know how to make songs.  Anyway, Cassia Fistula definitely sounds like he doesn't know how to
    something right.</p><p>
    
    The record starts off with the decidedly off-putting ""Section One"".  The man couldn't even think of a decent
    title, and he's not from Iceland, so you can't say he doesn't know the language.  Of course, it wouldn't
    really matter because it's simply 16 minutes and 48 seconds of computerized burping.  I'm sorry, but that's
    what it sounds like to me.  It starts off silent, and then goes right in to the burping drone noise, and
    only gets louder.  At one point near the end, it actually gets so loud I have to turn down my player.  I
    think people should learn to make music that doesn't make you turn down your players.  Anyway, once I
    listened to this, and it made me think of terrible things like my dog Thurber who died one summer when I
    was away, and also of smashing mother's mirror, so I don't ever want to play it again.</p><p>
    
    ""Section Two"" (is he ever going to stop with these titles??) starts out with just a moan, like what I hear
    when the fish tank battery is going out if I stick my ear right up on it.  There's a lot of echo and a
    little tone sliding up and down, which also kind of reminds me of small fish.  If you listen to this, you're
    going to be confused like me.  Sometimes it sounds like those fish are howling, like wolves, and I know that
    should not be.  Why does this Walls boy insist on filling up so much space with spacy sounds?  It's nutty if
    you ask me.  But one time I played it when mother was gone, and I was staring at the wall, and it felt like
    when I was sick and had to take codeine.  I think my eyes started having hallucinations, because the wall
    looked like it was smearing, and I couldn't feel my legs anymore.  I guess... well, it was okay.</p><p>
    
    The last song is the most scary.  It's just a big rumbling at first, like being on a plane when everyone
    else is asleep.  It makes my little hairs stand up.  As it goes on, it gets louder and louder, and at first
    I thought my little speakers had given out, but that's really just the way it sounds.  The funny thing is,
    the more I listen to this (I lied, I've played it every day since I got it), the more I find that I'm not
    as scared as before.  I think if I played this for you, you might think I was crazy, but maybe this Walls
    boy doesn't want to frighten me as much as he just wants me to pay more attention.  Oh sticks, mother's
    home, so I better stop.  I don't want her to think I've been listening to records all day.</p></div>"|8573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8573-cassia-fistula/|7.8|Dominique Leone

This pegs the tricky
    thing about musical innovation: you can set out boldly in search of liberation, set foot in uncharted
    realms, and stride back shouting ""look at what we've done,"" but five years later, your new hinterlands
    will likely have lots of cute little condos on them with families living inside.  This is exactly what's
    happened with IDM, which is terrific.  Our bold adventurers led us into The New, and their successors
    camped out there.</p><p>
    So, now that an IDM 'sound' has been established and we've put in the ranch homes and the post office, what
    do we do with it?  Tigerbeat6 and Morr Music, though not strictly IDM-based labels, seem to have the most
    compelling answers to that question.  Tigerbeat's is: now that the homes are built, let's live in them--
    muss them up and fill them with dirty and jokes and dirty jokes instead of treating them like museums.
    Morr Music is even less of an IDM label than Tigerbeat6-- many of its releases run toward minimal techno
    and electro. Nevertheless, they too have an answer.  They've rightly decided that living in this new
    frontier constitutes some difficult cerebral challenge: drop the hard-living pose, they say, and let's
    decorate.  Morr's artists take the sounds and techniques of IDM, techno, electronica-- the textures, the
    relentless formalism-- and fashion them into something that often points toward pop music.</p><p>
    Which is why it's natural that the Morr crew have put together this two-disc tribute to shoegazer messiahs
    Slowdive, a band whose whole focus was the tension between elaborate textures and vivid pop. We'll skip how
    tremendous Slowdive were and how brilliant the Morr stuff is (though the short answer is 'very').  Thus,
    it's with deep regret that I must announce that the first disc of this comp-- the one with the actual
    Slowdive covers-- isn't all that great. Even the Múm track. <i>Especially</i> the Múm track.</p><p>
    Here's the thing: Slowdive's Neil Halstead is a good songwriter with a distinctively languid, narcotized
    feel running through most of his work.  But Slowdive's various walls of woozily swelling guitars weren't
    just ornamentation; they were integral parts of the songs. ""When the Sun Hits"", from <i>Souvlaki</i>, crawls
    through its first verse on a high-hat tick, bass pulse, and guitar echo.  Halstead tosses off, ""It matters
    where you are,"" and an oceanic gale of guitar and synth kicks through. Get it? It <i>matters</i> where you
    are.</p><p>
    ""When the Sun Hits"" gets covered twice here, first by Solvent and later by Komëit. The Solvent version points
    to problems. The Morr cadre is devotedly minimal, exercising great skill in letting two or three really
    compelling sounds do the work of seven or eight mediocre ones. So Solvent kicks off well-- subtle, condensed,
    robotic. And then ""it matters where you are,"" but... nothing.  None of the cathartic swell which was part
    and parcel of Slowdive's songs. No one on this disc even <i>tries</i> to tackle it, not with noise or glitch
    or giant synth pads. Nothing.  Which is slightly different from the standard complaint of the guy who can't
    tolerate anyone reinterpreting the originals-- it's not that they're taking liberties here, it's that they're
    occasionally skirting the songs' purposes without introducing new ones.</p><p>
    Some tracks do okay nonetheless, creating enough of their own dynamics that they don't miss Slowdive's.
    Lali Puna's ""40 Days"" uses just a bit of texture over steadily shifting and mounting drum programming;
    B Fleischmann and Ms John Soda turn ""Here She Comes"" into a minimalist invocation; Styrofoam makes a lovely
    chiming drift out of ""Altogether"".  And while you'd think someone would fare better with the tracks from
    Slowdive's last record, which itself dropped the full band and dipped into ambience, that is sadly not the
    case here. Ulrich Schnauss turns in what's basically a mild remix of ""Crazy for You"", and the usually
    promising Manual runs uninspired through ""Blue Skied an' Clear"". It all <i>sounds</i> really great, though
    it doesn't seem like much of a victory, given how epically perfect this whole thing could have been.</p><p>
    But here's why you should buy it anyway: there's a second disc, a proper Morr comp except occasionally
    ""inspired"" by the Slowdive theme. And it's Morr in fine form-- gorgeously structured, exquisitely assembled,
    cerebral and beautiful, clean-lined and melodic, and somehow leagues ahead of the interchangeable 'organic'
    IDM records anonymously littering store shelves. Most striking is Guitar's ""House Full of Time"", the first
    imitation of <i>Loveless</i> (perhaps they got their shoegazer bands mixed up) that I'm tempted to say is
    actually better than a lot of the original.  Next most striking is Ms John Soda's ""Solid Ground"", a sunny
    progress of sine blips, pizzicato strings, vocals, and sparse drumming that works the song-based accessibility
    angle as well as Lali Puna and the Notwist do.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, Ulrich Schnauss redeems himself with a motorik workup to some float-by vocals and stunning drum
    shifts. Styrofoam gives us a drum program and an emo ballad (this is a good thing), Manual concocts something
    that sounds like Slowdive covered by smooth-jazz enthusiasts (this, too), and Komëit dresses up as the Kings
    of Convenience (we'll have to think on that one).  Plus, Solvent teases us with the instrumental for a track
    from his forthcoming electro vocal project. Any dissipation of faith in Morr that occurs during disc one is
    obliterated.</p><p>
    Begin with exploration analogy, end with pun: Morr, Morr, Morr.</p></div>"|1940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1940-blue-skied-an-clear/|7.3|Nitsuh Abebe

    touched. If you don't accept this as an irrefutable fact, turn off <i>Ghostbusters</i>, put down your New
    Coke, and go buy <i>Innervisions</i>, <i>Fulfillingness</i>, and <i>Songs in the Key of Life</i>.  Believe me,
    you won't be disappointed. If you're already familiar with these classics, then you can imagine the uproar
    caused when word leaked out of the Stones Throw camp that hip-hop/jazzbo extraordinaire Madlib had covered
    14 classic Stevie Wonder tunes.</p><p>
    
    It all started innocently enough; recorded between 2000-2001, <i>Stevie</i>
    was never intended to be officially released.  After Madlib, who was then recording under the guise of jazz
    band Yesterdays New Quintet, realized that he had an entire album's worth of Stevie instrumentals, he
    compiled them onto a single CD and presumably set them in the same stack as his other 12 unreleased
    Yesterdays New Quintet albums.  Close friend and Stones Throw guru Peanut Butter Wolf saw the disc, made
    a copy, and passed it around the Stones Throw office.  Within a week, clothing line Triple 5 approached
    Stones Throw about doing a limited pressing of unreleased material for promotional purposes, PBW handed
    over these tapes, and the hype steamrolled from there.</p><p>
    
    Although it would be nearly impossible to replicate the soul-tagging genius of Wonder, in part because no
    one has a voice like Stevie's, Madlib is able to add his own special twist to the songs.  His success can
    largely be attributed to his understanding the strength of the source material. There are minor electronic
    touches, but Madlib has too much reverence for Wonder to butcher his songs with unnecessary hip-hop
    pyrotechnics.  In fact, while hip-hop does inform Madlib's interpretations, he sprinkles the mix with a dab
    of jazz fusion, a pinch of samba, and just a touch of lounge to make this a slinky, 70s-infused affair.
    For ""Too High"", Madlib digs into the track's ultra-funky opening groove before dropping the chorus'
    familiar keyboard riff.  On ""Superwoman"" Madlib busts out the vibes, pounds away at the keys, and tweaks
    the beat, resulting in a sublimely spacy breaks fest that's going to have loop diggas salivating until
    3k.</p><p>
    
    Although Madlib pays mind to the tracks' melodies with some pretty stellar key work, the focus of almost
    every track is the rhythm section.  ""Visions"", which is the track most significantly altered, is given a
    funky rev up and would sound at home in a Melvin Peebles movie. Other highlights include scorching versions
    of ""Superstition"" and ""You Got It Bad, Girl"".</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, when the compositions are slower and more involved, as is the case with ""Send Out Your Love"",
    Madlib stumbles a bit and the music tends to meander and drag. And also be warned: the album has a mellow
    vibe, and if you're the type who's repelled by anything that even approaches being 'smooth,' you probably
    won't dig this much.  These are minor complaints to me, though, as I find these tracks to be interesting
    reinterpretations of certified classics.  Stevie Wonder has long been an inspiration to hip-hop, and his
    repertoire has been sampled by numerous producers.  Hopefully, this album will make the connection explicit
    and turn an entire new generation onto the man's sweet sounds.</p></div>"|4177.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4177-stevie-vol-1/|7.9|Sam Chennault

The press surrounding their efforts always commends them for
    avoiding the grunge scene ascendant at the time, as well as the more staid course of their post-rock
    contemporaries in the years to come.  But despite all their Eastern song titles and instrumental tunings,
    it's doubtful the quartet fell that far from the proverbial tree.  They've always been the rock-n-roller's
    improv band; regardless of the number of bassists and drummers they've gone through, the rhythm section
    generally perseveres as the frame on which guitarist Glenn Jones and electro-wizard Robin Amos weave their
    psychedelic tapestries.  In recent years the band has seen an ill-fated collaboration with John Fahey, and
    1999's justifiably praised <i>Crashes to Light, Minutes to Its Fall</i>.</p><p>
    
    The music on <i>Immortality Lessons</i> was also recorded in 1999, at Brandeis University as part of WBRS'
    live music series ""The Joint"".  As the story goes, the band arrived in the midst of a stagnant, humorless
    summer day and proceeded to set up haphazardly, not expecting much from the cramped foyer they were to play
    in, nor the college radio DJ.  Upon playing back the tape weeks later, however, they discovered that the
    performance was remarkably well preserved.  According to the liner notes, you'd think the band had stumbled
    on a milestone of modern mathematics, but a few listens reveals all they could have hoped for: a nicely
    balanced, warm tone that captured the fluidity of the set.  As a document of the Cul de Sac experience, it
    stands better than their previous collection of studio outtakes, <i>I Don't Want to Go to Bed</i>.</p><p>
    
    The vaguely Eastern explorations of Glenn Jones' open-tuned guitar begin the set.  Robin Amos issues an
    undercurrent of electronics from his synthesizer, rustled up by Jon Proudman's cascading rolls and
    cymbal-showers.  He provides the transition to ""Enhoft Down"", a brief percussion interlude, and it's
    surprising how resonant the drums sound for a live recording.  The title track brings us back to a signature
    Cul de Sac move: wrangling speed bumps out of the bass, unleashing the guitar to skid across the surface.
    The band sounds a little taut here, as if their enthusiasm got away from them, but bassist Michael Bloom's
    vibrant scales guide the group back down.  ""Tartarugas"", Bloom's composition, contrasts a busy beat with
    the slow howl of synthesizers and his bass.</p><p>
    
    All the elements seem to settle and the band really begins to groove by the fifth track, ""Frozen in Fury on
    the Roof of the World"".  Jones' intricate fingerpicking uncoils in spirals, finally coalescing into one of
    the few melodic motifs offered in the set.  The desolate electronic landscape in the background returns in
    ""The Dragonfly's Bright Eye"", one of the album's highlights.  The ten-minute epic starts off with just the
    gentle dribble of the guitar, but soon it ascends rapidly, prying open a Pandora's box of swarming
    synthesizers and electric burble.  It's a shame the fidelity wasn't high enough to capture this maelstrom
    perfectly, but the lo-fi sound adds an appropriately blurry edge to the inspired ""Liturgy"".  Amos samples
    a muezzin-like call-and-response chant and carefully feeds it through a delay pedal.</p><p>
    
    ""Blues in E"" closes, an eleven-minute lullaby, more patient and restrained than much of the band's work.
    The dusky ambience reminds me of the liner notes, where Glenn Jones opines that ""ours have always struck me
    as evening ragas-- music for after dark.""  Cul de Sac may not offer the eternal enlightenment implied in the
    album title, and these guys aren't exactly comparable to John Zorn and other gods of the improv scene, but
    their ecstatic instrumentals will definitely appeal across lines, from space-rockers to jam-band enthusiasts.
    As with most of Cul de Sac's recordings, a slightly sentimental tone pervades, somewhere between forward-looking
    and backwards-glancing.  And occasionally, that's all the uplift you need.</p></div>"|1684.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1684-immortality-lessons/|7.2|Christopher Dare

    young ears these days, but when it first dropped in 1990 it epitomized the sound of a bold new era in which
    old-school club kids, shoegazers, and college students could unite under the common aim of getting wasted
    at dance parties without having to deal with the Happy Mondays.  This formula earned Primal Scream a
    certified classic with 1991's <i>Screamadelica</i>, but the band, for whatever reason, seemed dissatisfied
    with their burgeoning reputation as rave rangers and reinvented themselves.  Twice, in fact: first as
    Stones-influenced retro rockers on 1994's rightfully maligned <i>Give Out But Don't Give Up</i>, and then
    as a dubbed-out electronic pop band on 1997's more successful <i>Vanishing Point</i>.</p><p>
    
    In 2000, the band took another sharp turn, though one not quite as outlandish as their previous two, with
    the stunning <i>XTRMNTR</i>, an abrasive, industrial grinder dense with concentrated, caustic production
    and raging political antagonism.  Aided by a bevy of celebrity producers including Kevin Shields, the
    Chemical Brothers and The Automator, <i>XTRMNTR</i> vacillated between the hyperbolized fury of political
    punk bands and the breathless crunch of a cavernous dance club on Halloween.  It wasn't pretty, and that
    was the point.  Yet, detracting from the impact of the music's nuclear decimation stood singer Bobby
    Gillespie's hit-or-miss lyrics.  At times spot-on, and at others painfully cliched, his observations could
    either make or break the band's riotous assaults.  This, of course, led to reservations, so despite
    <i>XTRMNTR</i>'s moments of glory, I filed it away and crossed my fingers awaiting its follow-up.  After
    all, Primal Scream may be known for a lot of things, but consistency of style is not one of them.</p><p>
<i>Evil Heat</i> follows a similar course to <i>XTRMNTR</i>.  Its anger and righteous indignation, though
    tweaked a bit in the post 9/11 aftermath (""Bomb the Pentagon,"" for fear of seeming cruelly redundant, was
    rewritten and retitled ""Rise""), comes off largely affecting.  And the band's employment of outside talents
    doesn't hurt, either:  Two Lone Swordsmen's Andrew Weatherall co-produced (hearkening back to his work on
    <i>Screamadelica</i>), and the increasingly ubiquitous, if invisible, Kevin Shields lent at least his name,
    if nothing else.  Unfortunately, the rather <i>un</i>talented Kate Moss also shows up, playing Nancy Sinatra
    to Gillespie's electrocuted Lee Hazlewood in one of the most off-putting remakes of ""Some Velvet Morning""
    I've ever heard.</p><p>
    
    But the biggest detractor here is the band's lack of focus.  The record is downright messy at times, even
    if the thick, murky quality does, in some instances, work to considerable effect.  ""Deep Hit of Morning Sun""
    builds out of simple, eerie synths into a muddle of distorted buzzes and beeps, fuzzed-out guitar, and the
    creepiest chorus ever to back that age-old British lyrical prosaism ""shine on me.""  The clamor congeals
    beautifully, seeming like a perfect marriage of the album's diverse (and often divergent) sounds, and it's
    a rare moment on an album that otherwise tends to either pummel you or hold you at arm's length.</p><p>
    
    Likewise, the Krautrock-inspired ""Autobahn 66"" and ""Skanner Darkly"" (both of which unite Weatherall with
    his Two Lone Swordsmen ally Keith Tenniswood) are clean, nearly dreamy respites from the turgid tracks that
    surround them, despite the former's seeming destiny for use in a Volkswagen commercial.  Interestingly,
    Primal Scream also include two swaggering garage-rock songs, perhaps to offset the record's preponderance
    of electronically manipulated noise.  ""City"" trumps the Stoogesque roar of any current Scandinavian-flavor-of-the-month
    by actually doing the apparent source material justice.  And the entertaining, if gratuitous, guilty pleasure
    ""Skull X"" features Gillespie's best Bob Dylan impression over a blustering rock squall.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, these songs are the exceptions.  The rest of <i>Evil Heat</i> has forgone the creative noise collage
    that saved <i>XTRMNTR</i> from the depths of quasi-industrial whining, and given in wholesale to generic
    Nine Inch Nails knockoffs.  I wish I could tell you that ""Miss Lucifer"" shared only its name with your
    local venue's teen goth night, or that the inadvertently hysterical ""Rise"" (lyric sample: ""Sweet 16
    dehumanized!/ Death's head factory suicide!"") maintained any of its initial threat to post-9/11 National
    Security rather than reveling in neutered ""Head Like a Hole"" artificiality.  I wish I never had to
    consider listing Stabbing Westward as a point of reference.  But fate, as it just so happens, is entirely
    too cruel, and that goes double for Primal Scream who, at this late stage in their careers, find themselves
    in desperate need of yet another revision.</p></div>"|6475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6475-evil-heat/|6.0|Alison Fields

""C'mon"" while you wait for an eight-minute exercise in tragic monotony to develop into
    anything at all (it never does).  ""C'mon"" when you realize that the next song is exactly the same.  ""C'mon""
    with cautious optimism as you search frantically for some of aspect of Town and Country's latest splur to
    justify the twelve bucks you were (hopefully not) forced to pay; a search that becomes more fruitless with
    every track.  ""C'mon"" as you wait for the wreckage of this album to stop smoldering in your CD player after
    forty-four minutes of nothing but wasted time.</p><p>
    
    Post-rock, at its best, is utterly transportive-- no longer relying on the limitations of traditional form
    and instrumentation frees the genre's arrangements to navigate soundscapes unreachable by most practitioners
    of the verse/chorus/verse rock dogma.  Unfortunately, Town and Country is less like post-rock and more like
    pre-interesting.  <i>C'mon</i> rejects the most unique and dynamic aspects of the genre in exchange for
    numbing repetition and structures as rigid and monolithic as a bomb shelter.  And finally, after being
    reconciled to the poverty of <i>C'mon</i>'s musical value, there's not an emotion to be found in its
    clinically detached artiness.</p><p>
    
    I'm not trying to criticize Town and Country for failure to adhere to the post-rock party line; change is
    good-- just not when it's a giant step backwards.  The idea of challenging genre convention is fantastic--
    in retrospect, much of Tortoise's early work looks like aimless tail-chasing after being contrasted with
    the sweep of <i>Standards</i>' heretofore-unseen grandeur.  But, of course, that sort of vision is difficult
    and in short supply, so the question that Town and Country asks is, ""Why bother issuing a challenge when it's
    so much easier to retreat?""  And, out of politeness, <i>C'mon</i> serves as its own answer: lacking any
    dynamism, complexity, or invention, the relentless drone of most of these tracks is a shallow, reactionary
    statement to the progress of the post-rock genre, and completely unedifying.</p><p>
    
    This is more of a technical study than an actual album; less than a thought is given to emotion, drama, or
    anything else that might be even remotely compelling to the listener.  Any impact these tunes might have is
    accidental spillover from their titles, making them little more than hoaxes; listen to ""Going to Kamakura"",
    and sure, it sounds to be (very) vaguely of Japanese descent, but listen to it without a tracklist and it
    barely qualifies as Muzak.  These little trips to nowhere are designed to be studied (since you can't get
    close enough to the music to truly enjoy it); call it Music to Smoke Cloves By (to broadly paraphrase my
    esteemed colleague Mr Sirota's critique).</p><p>
    
    As a unit, <i>C'mon</i> borders on being entirely indigestible.  The closest it comes to listenability
    arrives at the beginning and the end of ""The Bells"", which, as the name implies, is a lengthy trumpet solo.
    The cloying vibraphone, bells, and feathery acoustics that populate the rest of the album are mercifully
    absent, and the melody actually approximates a real human emotion (fond regret, perhaps?).  But it bookends
    three minutes of a single trumpet note being blown in steady rhythm, unintentionally invoking another human
    emotion: anger.  I don't know what I'd prefer-- an album so mechanical and uninspired as to be almost
    robotic, or one so frustrating that it makes me swear at my speakers.  Wait, that's right; neither.</p></div>"|8122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8122-cmon/|2.4|Eric Carr

Peanut Butter Wolf, who founded the
    San Francisco label and oversees its daily operations, has assembled a tight-knit group of like-minded
    artists who adhere to the cratedigger's ethic of vinyl archeology. But perhaps more importantly, Peanut
    Butter Wolf understands the commercial limitations of his label's focus and never allows expectations of
    profitability to muddle the Stones Throw mission to saturate the planet with the dopest beats possible.
    Case in point: the Jukebox 45s series.  Not only are a large number of the 24 releases reissues of
    ridiculously obscure garage funk from the 70s, but their mere format (on old-school seven-inches formerly
    used for jukeboxes and edited radio singles) precludes any sort of crossover potential. And what's even
    more appalling from a business standpoint is that many of the other seven-inches are exclusive material
    from the label's most marketable artist, Madlib.</p><p>
    And just why has PBW stuck his financial neck out for 45s, you might be wondering?  Well, as he explains in
    the disc's liner notes, he made a promise to himself that when he got older he ""would eventually buy a
    jukebox for my home and have only hip-hop songs on it.""  Sounds good to me.  After all, hip-hop, from the
    act of sampling to the black artists' refusal to be tagged with their slave names, has always focused on
    reclaiming and reinterpreting a collective or personal past. And this desire for reclamation not only
    dictates the medium of the initial releases of the Stones Throw 45s, but also extends to the track selection
    and their placement on this compilation.</p><p>
    If you look closely, you'll notice that an old-school soul number
    such as The Highlighters' ""Poppin' Popcorn"" is sandwiched between hip-hop emcee Medaphor's ""Place Your Bet""
    and a new-school breakbeat track supplied by über-funksters Breakestra.  Placing these musical cousins
    side by side is a perfect example of the dynamic between influence and art that PBW is attempting to achieve
    with the Jukebox 45 series.  The hip-hop songs on here are built upon the spirit of the funk/soul tracks
    that are included, while modern day bands like Breakestra and Yesterday's New Quintet are reinterpreting
    that funk through the lens of hip-hop. It's a circular, symbiotic relationship that is unique in the music
    world and results in a seamless mixture of sounds both educational and dope. Which leads us to what really
    matters: the music.</p><p>
    Having been in this game for over a decade, Peanut Butter Wolf knows hip-hop, and he knows that Madlib makes
    good hip-hop. With the exception of the Charizma track, all of the Jukebox's traditional hip-hop songs are
    produced by Madlib, which is by no means a liability. Madlib's hip-hop tracks on this album can be divided
    into two different strains: the first consists of slightly off-kilter and jazzy productions coupled with a
    novel and often conceptual approach to the lyrics, while the others tracks are more straightforward,
    aggressive and funky.  For the remix of Quasimoto's ""Microphone Mathematics"", which belongs squarely in the
    latter category, Madlib supplies a bassline that springs off the beat like a funkified yoyo. A chorus
    anchored with a sample from De La Soul's ""The Bizness"", which finds Pos scolding emcees who ""try keeping it
    real, yet you should try keeping it right,"" nicely complements the beat.  Of course, you already know that
    Lord Quas keeps it right, declaring that his intention ""elevate styles beyond explication, turn up the mic
    [and] increase the amplification.""  While it's hard to improve upon the original ""Microphone Mathematics"",
    this remix does at least match the original.</p><p>
    On the quirky jazz tip, there's Dudley Perkin's ""Flowers"" and Lootpack's ""On Point"".  The Dudley Perkins
    track was improvised and originally intended as a joke, but its ghetto pastoral fabulousness renders it too
    sweet to be written off as mere novelty.  Although Perkins probably shouldn't quit his day job as
    blunted-before-breakfast emcee Declaime, his kitschy rasp on ""Flowers"" fits the track's lovely piano sample
    like an astral glove. The Lootpack cut, ""On Point"", features a similar, piano-based sample, although this
    one is a little loopier and not quite as infectious as ""Flowers"".  For the vocals, Madlib literally spells
    out his very alliterative verses in a dizzying display of skills that will either leave you breathless or
    very confused.</p><p>
    Although Madlib's brand of hip-hop has become a trademark of sorts for Stones Throw, the most intriguing
    tracks are the garage soul/funk reissues. The Ernie and the Top Notes' ""Things Could Be Better"" is by far
    the most soulful and technically accomplished.  The music, with a rhythm section that displays a refrained
    funk while a bluesy guitar line doodles on top, captures the transition between the soulful swagger of 60s
    Motown and the funkadelic strut that dominated the 70s scene.  Whereas ""Things Could Be Better"" conjures a
    late-Motown sound, the Stark Reality's ""Rocket Ship"", released in 1970, is more akin to the garage psych of
    Captain Beefheart or even Syd Barrett.  With serrated dissonance and chanted vocals, whether or not you
    like this will depend upon your tolerance for lo-fi noise.</p><p>
    While the Yesterday's New Quintet and Breakestra songs shine, Captain Funkaho's ode to the Atari 2600, ""My
    2600"", takes the prize for the best nu-funk/jazz song on the album.  Perhaps the most fitting way to describe
    this song would be to mention that it was recorded in the back room of an actual working Laundromat in
    Oakland.  With its cheeseball vocals and rolling basslines, it perfectly captures the ghetto-dirty-laundry
    vibe that its setting demanded. On a side note, Bay Area indie scenesters should remember the track's female
    singer, Robin, from her days as a lead singer for the Lookout! Records punk group Black Fork.</p><p>
    Over the years, Stones Throw has forged through the trends, resisted the pull of commercialism, and along
    the way churned out some classic material.  If nothing else, their success should prove that it's possible
    to maintain a very personalized vision of music and run a successful record label.  Although this isn't
    likely to endure as the quintessential Stones Throw release (that distinction, for the time being, belongs

    except-- and this could just be the title-- it sounds like music about animals, or specifically, music for
    an animal documentary.  I'm picturing one of those shows on PBS, with birds pecking around or turtles going
    at it.  The music has elegance, though like those shows, it can be too staid or staged: it needs more
    violence, like a good alligator/hippo fight, or some cheetahs to chase the gazelles.  Long story short: it's
    pleasant, but not always striking.</p><p>
    
    Parish first won me over in 1996 with the blues/noise music he wrote for PJ Harvey's psycho road lyrics on
    their joint album <i>Dance Hall at Louse Point</i>.  That record was the raw edgy nerve next to Harvey's
    electronica and trip-hop phase, and its music was the highlight from her <i>Is This Desire</i> tour a few
    years back.  Parish has since worked as a guitarist and producer for bands like the Eels, Giant Sand, and
    Goldfrapp, but this is only his second record under his own name, and he crams several projects into its
    thirteen tracks.  The fact that it has any continuity is due partly to Parish's production-- which is unified
    and gorgeous-- but also to its prevailing mellowness: from Clare Mactaggart's solo violin on ""Absolute Beauty
    Is an Absolute Curse"", as slow and stately as a preening flamingo, to Pat Macdonald's loping, atmospheric
    harmonica on ""El Merreon"".</p><p>
    
    Several tracks feature Parish's big band, a dozen-strong ensemble with a brash sound centered on brass,
    Fender Rhodes, guitars and percussion. Parish takes the band through the soaring ""Westward Airways"", which
    could be the highlight of the album; but they're less successful on the title track and ""The Florida Recount"",
    which are loud and hammering-- the arrangements are less nuanced and the songs less enjoyable.</p><p>
    
    By contrast, the small-group tracks-- and solos like Parish's Fender Rhodes piece ""Lord It's a Happy Land""--
    are pretty, but they drift by like so many interludes.  So it's refreshing to hear the songs that use
    vocalists, where Parish gives a looser and louder performance.  On ""Bernadette"", the band rocks along
    beneath singer David Donahue's monologue with sharp guitar lines and a fleeter, less oppressive climax.
    That track's energy carries into the next song, ""Spanish Girls"", named for the young ladies whose singing--
    captured on the beach with a cassette recorder-- haunts the melody and draws out Parish's rowdiest playing:
    this ain't no serenade.  He also uses Donahue on ""Stable Life"", where the guitar effects and Aaron Dewey's
    shadow vocals turn a basic pop song into a shuffling, multi-layered piece.</p><p>
    
    The bulk of the album is so stately that the last track barely fits: Parish pulls in latter-day Captain
    Beefheart member Eric Drew Feldman (on ""fake harmonica"") and PJ Harvey on vocals, to cover ""Airplane Blues"",
    a textbook 12-bar blues with some fun innuendo: ""First he turns me over, then he starts to loop-the-loop/
    Takes a long time 'til his wings begin to droop.""  Harvey eats it alive, but it's so odd to hear Parish let
    his hair down this far that it feels like a throwaway encore.</p><p>
    
    And that last track demonstrates again that, although <i>How Animals Move</i> has solid arrangements and
    melodies, Parish is at his best when he mixes hard work and detail with spontaneous, rough-edged playing.
    It's not that the slow stuff doesn't work; it's just not as exciting or even as inventive as his rock music.
    If he can have so much fun behind singers, why does he get so studious on his own?</p></div>"|6167.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6167-how-animals-move/|6.7|Chris Dahlen

    'endearing'.  Might have something to do with how this jazzy lo-fi trio on Steve Shelley's indie label
    creates music that has been, to me, inappropriately categorized as both funk and bluegrass (depends on
    what you read). I think this sounds a hell of a lot like latter-day Coctails without all the bells, whistles
    and Archer Prewitt.</p><p>
    
    The Rochester-based trio's fifth album, <i>Good Night Sleep</i>, is an apt soundtrack for taking the long
    way home.  Fully loaded with slightly fractured jazzy chords and vocals just this side of falsetto, it's
    pretty low key, save for occasional forays into uptempo material like the opener, ""The Old Hotel"", with its
    dissonant take on the blues, and ""Border Song"", which alone gels the Coctails comparison and features an
    occasionally compelling, but largely pointless bass jam about three-quarters of the way through.</p><p>
    
    Some of the best songs on this album are the instrumentals. The closing ""Universal Bonus Trac"" features a
    simple, repetitive guitar line meandering around a backing cello. And without the inherent structural
    conventions that spring up with the introduction of lyrics (sort of gratuitous for this band), the song
    has a nice trance-like quality. Likewise, the airy, fingerpicked ""Space Whale"".</p><p>
    
    I suppose we could define this as cracked minimalist lounge music, but even with the minimalist tag, that
    infers a level of instrumentation, for better or worse, that is sorely lacking on this album. A better
    analogy might be a fairly sophisticated band's practice session if they were missing half their members
    and the PA.  On the plus side, the production quality is dynamic to say the least-- it lends Nod an enviable
    level of intimacy (it quite literally sounds like the band is playing in the corner of your living room),
    which can be a more than a little disconcerting.  Like listening to a concert without applause.  Unfortunately,
    this also serves to exaggerate their shortcomings.</p><p>
    
    I'm usually a vocal opponent of bands determined to 'make it bigger' whatever the cost, and I can't help but
    think this band could have used a little more studio time and some musical thickening here.  There's a nice
    sophistication to the music-- everything seems intelligent and premeditated-- but the chosen aesthetic
    prevents the album from going anywhere.  As a result, it flickers and fades, and its charms ultimately fall
    short of its seeming missteps.</p></div>"|5823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5823-good-night-sleep/|6.0|Alison Fields

<p>Crusty Reviewer at Current Age: Frank's back, twice, and he's pissed!  Sort of.  When he's not striking a     world-weary geetar-schlub pose, I mean.  But it's about time he started stomping around in response to how     every loud band since the 90s has been paying their bills with his dynamic chops.  I remember once when I's     working in a record store and 'the guy' from Better Than Ezra, one of the poppiest Pixies pilferers, came     in and bought R.E.M.'s <i>Murmur</i> and the first Smiths album. We can only hope they were backup copies.</p>
<p>Virginal Reviewer at Fifteen: I know R.E.M.! ""That's me in the corner... That's me in the spot... light...""     Hey, what's the music playing now?  Sounds like a less well-produced Black Francis.</p>
<p>Crusty: He's been Frank Black for a weird while now.  He released two stellar CDs eons ago on 4AD, which     eased us into his solo career like a parent slowly explaining a divorce.  But then he came out with a CD     on American Recordings that had Microsoft Paintbrush cover art and took two years to get into. Then he     birthed a merely okay handful of records with a backup band named the Catholics.</p>
<p>Virgin: Catholics... is he religious now?  Singing about wafers and commandments?</p>
<p>Crusty: Well, the word has other meanings, but at the time it was a kind of interesting choice. Retaining     the name now, I guess, requires a nugget of moxie.</p>
<p>Virgin: Why? What's up with the Catholics?</p>
<p>Crusty: You don't want to know. The backup band the Catholics has been stalwart, but Black's albums with     them have been kind of monotone, with lengthy, invasive solos that seem to provide loaf-breaks for Black.     And the cover art has been, and still is, heinous. I don't want to sound petty, but those 4AD Pixies covers     seemed three-dimensional even on cassette inserts. Black's current lame packaging is the worst on spinART.     These albums look like the homemade tour-comps of an unsigned band.</p>
<p>Virgin: This can't be Black Francis playing. It's too... conventional. The Pixies were like astronaut-punk.     This is like that Costello crap that those rich jagoffs at gifted camp loved.</p>
<p>Crusty: I wouldn't go that far, but then again I'm just a you who's been compromised by time.  These two     albums contain exceptional verse-chorus-verse songs, and the distance from great track to great track is     never farther than a few minutes. Black's the rare elder statesman who occasionally remembers how to rock--     he's a not-boring Mould/Westerberg! I mean it, he comes alive on these albums, sounding passionate and     bothered in ways he hasn't in a while, reminding us that he can still be heard haunting some great modern     work by Modest Mouse and the White Stripes.</p>
<p>Virgin:  Who are they? Did Nirvana ever do anything after <i>Bleach</i>?</p>
<p>Crusty:  Shhh. Let the adult talk. The 65-minute, 18-song <i>Black Letter Days</i> showcases all of Black's     known skills and even hones some new ones.  It opens and closes with different version of Tom Waits' ""The     Black Rider""-- one's a Satan's-cruise-ship ditty; the other's a surf-organ nightmare.  Then, halfway through,     Black tosses country in the mix and songs emerge with Gibb Brothers falsettos, Van Morrison beltings, even     Paul Simon pluckiness. ""I Will Run After You"" could have been a <i>Doolittle</i> b-side.  And try escaping     the bouncy ""Chip Away Boy"" or the balladeering ""Cold Heart of Stone"".</p>
<p>Virgin: Since when is sounding like the Gibb Brothers or Paul Simon a good thing? This stuff is stale. What     the hell happened to this guy? Just last night the Pixies hosted Postmodern MTV, pretending to be telepathic!     They just smiled at the camera during prerecorded vocal segues.  They premiered the ""Here Comes Your Man""     video... and this trad-poof is all Frank Francis can muster now?</p>
<p>Crusty: I hear you.  But if nothing else, Frank's 33-minute <i>Devil's Workshop</i> is the punchy record     that should have followed <i>Teenager of the Year</i>.  It's full of that ching-a-ling radio sound he     debuted a few times on <i>The Cult of Ray</i>. ""Out of State"" is sweet and driving, and ""Modern Age"" is a     close-to-complacent shout-out to surrealism and post-70s rock.</p>
<p>Virgin: Ching-a-ling don't cut it, there, Ace. Why hasn't he taken more chances with the recipe? This is     what old people listen to on their way to work in the morning.</p>
<p>Crusty: Old is how you're gonna feel when the indie-crop is too green to have bought a Pixies album when it     was new, or to have even gone through an ex-post-facto phase. Be glad you're getting a taste of <i>Devil's     Workshop</i>. The set's so unilaterally catchy that your head becomes like a bus station crowded with     singing schizophrenics.  The solos are incorporated into the songs' structures instead of being these     ham-jammy interludes where the song stops for some <i>reeeooowwll</i>.  Who besides Frank Black sounds cool     when he whines?</p>
<p>Virgin: You sold out or became a drunk if you dig this tame dross.</p>
<p>Crusty: 'Dross...' I like that. Getting ready for the SAT already. No wonder only the stepdaughters of     bible-study leaders liked us.  But back to Black: the problem-- the big hence-my-rating problem-- is the     production. The listener wishes that Frank and his posse (of six on <i>Days</i>, four on <i>Workshop</i>,     with cameos by Joey Santiago and ex-Wall of Voodoo frontman Stan Ridgway) were more patient and gave these     albums a semblance of a soundscape. Some guitar separation or cavernous drums, something besides the     straight-to-stereo/mono crank-out. They robbed themselves of foreverness. Just listen to the difference     the shimmery pedal steel makes on ""Valentine and Garuda"" and ""Southbound Bevy"".</p>
<p>Virgin: Turn off that country shit.</p>
<p>Crusty: That 'country shit' is going to help you through many a night, chum.  I want you to buy an album by     a group called Palace Brothers as soon as it comes out. And start doing sit-ups now. We've inherited Pappy's     subtle man-boobs and they're getting harder to fend off.</p>
<p>Virgin: Plus, you've got student loans and ex-wives and you're not a kickboxer. The future sucks.</p>
<p>Crusty: The modern age may not be as dandy as Frank Black proclaims it to be, what with the brink of global     catastrophe and all, but these at-least-solid platters save us from having to watch E!'s ""The Pixies Curse""     Special right after the one about ""Family Feud"".</p></div>"|783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/783-black-letter-days-and-devils-workshop/|6.9|William Bowers

    drives the creative engine of a thousand guitar-wielding Droopy Dans and Dianes.
    To extend the metaphor, the most oil-rich region of the world is undoubtedly the
    United Kingdom, with Scotland serving as the Saudi Arabia crown jewel of resource
    surplus.  I've never set foot in the land of kilts, bagpipes, and Groundskeeper
    Willie, but I've watched enough British Open television coverage to know that sun
    is an exceptionally rare commodity in this squall-laden territory.  One can almost
    imagine Scotsmen harvesting bushels of gloom from beneath their many moors, a
    candidate in its own right for most depressing environmental feature.</p><p>
    
    So then, it's no surprise that rainy day rock royalty Belle &amp; Sebastian hail from
    Scotland, as well as many lesser members of the genre's nobility: Arab Strap, Mogwai,
    Astrid, Eva, and so on.  All of the above have sent representatives Parliament-style
    to back up Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody and his Reindeer Section project, first last
    year with the decidedly un-British-sounding <i>Y'all Get Scared Now, Ya Hear!</i> and
    again with the shiny new <i>Son of Evil Reindeer</i>.  For the second album, Lightbody
    adds even <i>more</i> countrymen to his stable, signing up Cobain idol Eugene Kelly of
    the Vaselines, Idlewild's Roddy Woomble, and Teenage Fanclub's Norman Blake.  Guess
    we'll have to wait until album #3 to get the Bay City Rollers.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, it's a telling fact that, despite all these, um, famous names, the most
    compelling track on <i>Son of Evil Reindeer</i> is ""Where I Fall,"" the one track stripped
    down to just Lightbody playing folksinger solitaire.  It's not that the contributions
    aren't competent, but for such a varied cast of characters, the arrangements are
    surprisingly familiar.  Only B&amp;S; trumpetman Mick Cooke, who provides typically playful
    and catchy horn flourishes throughout, and vocal contributions from Kelly, Arab Strap's
    Aidan Moffat, and Eva's Jenny Reeve register as anything more than just session work from
    the carefully assembled starpower.</p><p>
    
    It's the vocal combinations Lightbody seems most concerned with, though, and the guest
    appearances provide a bit of a palate to choose from for the task of coloring in his
    song sketches.  Most of the male mic-men (Lightbody, Blake, Woomble) bring similar shades
    of buttermilk croon to the table, but Moffat shines with a disinterested thick lilt over
    the minor chord piano swirls of ""Whodunnit.""  Reeve's harmonies make already plush songs
    all the more pillowy, combining with Lightbody for a half-thawed Low sound on ""Cartwheels""
    and ""Budapest"".</p><p>
    
    Still, there's very little on <i>Son of Evil Reindeer</i> to perk up the ears for anyone
    with more than a couple Jeepster products in their Case Logic.  Its twelve songs all chart
    somewhere between the low point of dullish (drum machine snoozer ""Who Told You?"", the
    uncomfortably anthemic ""You Are My Joy"") and the high point of pleasant (frown-pop gem
    ""Strike Me Down"").  All too often Lightbody's compositions resort to textbook dynamics,
    most commonly of the soft-acoustic-pluck-gradually-changing-into-string-and-brass-laden-lush-peak
    sort (consult ""Grand Parade"" or ""Cartwheels"" for context).</p><p>
    
    All the same, at the Nick Drake Memorial Melancholy Pop World Championships, the Reindeer
    Section is a tough Dream Team to beat, with only the equally rain-soaked Northwest U.S. squad
    the Long Winters able to match up.  And while <i>Son of Evil Reindeer</i> could be pretty easily
    interchanged with the day job projects of any single member participating, the fact remains
    that the Scottish do this kind of mostly cloudy ambience better than any other autonomous
    region, and a sampling of their near-best talent provides just about exactly what you would
    expect.  Like a rainy Sunday, it's soothing in small quantities, but may induce restlessness
    over extended periods.</p></div>"|6746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6746-son-of-evil-reindeer/|6.6|Rob Mitchum

    stuff that can be said about it, which might prove an issue here.  But it seems--
    both journalistically and morally-- sort of just wrong to set a critical land
    speed record talking about an album as solid-but-not-brilliant as this one is,
    so we'll try to give it some thought.</p><p>
    
    Zelienople are a pretty good band from Chicago, and they've released the very
    badly titled <i>Pajama Avenue</i> on Loose Thread Recordings, a label that's been
    taking care of the city's spacier bands for a few years now. They're not really a
    post-rock band, or a slowcore band, or a shoegazer band, but they sound like a lot
    of each, and also like a lot of those damned good 'lost generation' bands-- bands
    like Bark Psychosis and Disco Inferno, and records like Slowdive's last one.
    They're equally likely to remind you of a less gritty Crescent, a less earthy
    Movietone, a more abstracted American Analog Set, or a sleepier Bedhead.  Or the
    big clumsy tag we'll <i>all</i> follow: Yo La Tengo's <i>And then Nothing Turned
    Itself Inside-Out</i>.  Only turn down the sweetie pop and crank up the steely eyes.</p><p>
    
    All of which is to say that Zelienople are infinitely mellow, spacy and subdued.
    Drums sketch out hypnotic heartbeat rhythms and build splashes of cymbal; bass
    pulses steadily along; guitar echoes and swells in cushy pads and drones; organs
    hum; sometimes a heavily reverbed clarinet winds meditatively through. A significant
    percentage of Zelienople's instruments are filtered through delay effects, and one
    of their many skills is near-perfect coordination between the blissy major-key
    bits of this and the more darkly hypnotic bits, which keeps a helpful internal
    tension running through each of these tracks.</p><p>
    
    More to the point, though, they've settled on a workable sound and they use it
    quite effectively. For some of us, you understand, it's difficult <i>not</i> to
    like this sort of thing in the first place: it's a beautiful and massively
    rewarding trick of scale. Sounds move by in such contemplative slow motion that
    the slightest bits of texture seem like revelations-- every sound accrues this
    layer of determination and intensity around it. The whole thing can drift
    peacefully by, but a little attention reveals an immensely dramatic topography
    of texture and movement. The songs pulse and plod so subtly onward that when
    things click and shift within them, it can seem like an earthquake.</p><p>
    
    And Zelienople, despite their embarrassing album-naming gaffe, are really quite
    terrific with the execution of this sort of thing. Which is what tempts that
    aforementioned critical speed record: yes, they're good, no argument.  If you
    like this sort of thing, you'll be anything from pleased to outright captivated.
    If you don't, move along.  The other possibility is that perhaps you do like
    this sort of thing, but have burned out on its creeping growth through the indie
    underbrush-- in which it's my considered opinion that you'd still quite enjoy
    this but should maybe take the cue to move on anyway. Personally, I'll be
    keeping this one around: it'll come in handy some night when the indie stoners
    are over.</p></div>"|8943.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8943-pajama-avenue/|7.0|Nitsuh Abebe

    Thes One provides a well-articulated manifesto where he defines the duo's
    sound as ""just good old hip-hop.""  He further goes on to say that ""somewhere
    along the way it seems most critics decided that just making hip-hop was not
    good enough, and praises were hailed upon those who were 'experimental' and
    'progressive'... [and] underground hip-hop became a symbol of suburban
    rebellion across the Internet.""  This is an interesting point that reflects
    a growing divide within the independent/underground hip-hop community.
    Although hip-hop has never been aesthetically homogeneous, the curtain rift
    between old and new threatens divide the genre into two distinctively
    different sounds:</p><p>
    
    The artists associated with Anticon and Warp Records' hip-hop imprint Lex
    press hip-hop's sound forward at an unrelenting speed that has critics
    heralding the emergence of a new era.  While these artists wage war with
    their machines in suburban basements, another faction within the hip-hop
    community is solely dedicated to preserving the culture's heritage and, by
    extension, the musical fundamentals that it was built upon: deep groove
    samples, dope breakbeats, and simplistic, on-the-corner emceeing.  With
    <i>O.S.T.</i>, their third album, People Under the Stairs have made a
    musical tribute to these basics. And while it may not break any ground or
    shift any paradigms, the album is a testament to the enduring strength of
    straight-up, no-frills hip-hop.</p><p>
    
    Thes One is so dedicated to vinyl that even his bathroom is decorated with
    classic soul and jazz albums.  His nostalgia for the classics is pervasive
    throughout this record, and you can smell the 80s scent of linoleum, blunts
    and vinyl as he brings the rare grooves on song after song.  And not only
    do Thes and Double K, the other member of People Under the Stairs, dig
    deeper than almost anyone else, they also have a great sense of how to
    reconstruct their samples to illicit some soul-piercing sounds. On ""Empty
    Bottles of Water"", they place a relaxed, rippling key line over an upbeat
    drum track as Thes One raps, ""I travel to the beach where each and every
    wave sounds like ultimate breaks and beats."" On ""Acid Raindrops"", Thes One
    appropriates a sample from David Walker's cover of ""Lay Lady Lay"" while
    guest MC Camel raps about a day-in-the-life of a So-Cal b-boy.</p><p>
    
    Although People Under the Stairs flirt with soul, reggae and jazz, the key
    here is the funk.  ""The Hang Loose"" is an old school, roller-rink jam with
    a funky disco bassline.  Thes and Double affect an old school, Sugar Hill
    Gang flow and namedrop Dr. J, Kool and the Gang, and ""What's Happening""'s Rerun.
    On ""Tales of Kidd Drunkadelic"", a loungy keyboard bounces on top of a classic
    boom-bap drum track as a flute blows beneath the sample.  With the seamless
    ease that Thes and Double K weave their samples together, their life-long
    obsession with their music is apparent and infectious.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, lyrics aren't the duo's strong suit.  The lyrics generally
    revolve around their obsession with hip-hop culture, their love of alcohol/herb,
    and the (often uninteresting) minutia of their daily lives.  But given the
    celebratory funk that the music conjures, the relatively light and redundant
    subject matter isn't much of a liability.  After all, this isn't music for
    wannabe Lyotards twiddling their thumbs and worrying about some linguistic
    apocalypse; this is music for playing dominos and sipping on 40s. This is
    for those lazy days wasted on blunts and lounging by the pool. And there is
    absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p></div>"|6226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6226-ost/|7.7|Sam Chennault

Ordinarily, Herr Schreiber
    tosses shit towards my desk that only the bands and their parents know exist.
    And, not one to disturb a happy stasis, I'll generally pen a review that
    ensures that things remain that way.  This time, though, there are names I
    actually <i>recognize</i>: namely, bassist Keeley Davis and Mark Linkous,
    who produced two tracks.</p><p>
    
    Keeley Davis plays guitar for Engine Down.  I had the pleasure of overrating
    their most recent release, <i>Demure</i>, a couple months ago for this fine
    weblication. I don't know if Denali counts as a side-project or what, but
    one thing's for sure: Mr. Davis didn't intend the same guy to review both
    discs. Not a chance. It would be like submitting the same paper to two classes
    with the same prof. Or two of the same paper with different names to the same
    prof for the same class.  You get what I'm saying.  The point is, effective
    plagiarism requires cunning; repackaging Engine Down with a female singer
    and weaker songwriting is neither cunning nor enjoyable.</p><p>
    
    The surrogate lead for Denali is Keeley's sister, Maura.  She pulls that
    time-tested sultry, tremulous thing all album long, evoking, in her better
    moments, memories of Portishead's Beth Gibbons.  Her melodies match the
    melancholy mood of her vocal timbre, using protracted, dirge-like lines
    for an effect that may initially seem haunting, but eventually gets pretty
    old.  All in all, a fairly solid package from the vocalist, if somewhat
    repetitive.</p><p>
    
    But the band?  Well, from a strictly technical standpoint, they're pretty tight.
    They benefit, as previously noted, from the production work of Sparklehorse
    frontman Mark Linkous on two of the album's ten tracks, both of them sporting
    a few more ambient quirks than the others.  Engine Down's lead guitarist and
    frontman, Jonathan Fuller, is particularly proficient on drums here, too.
    However-- and this is a big 'however'-- the band's playing sorely lacks ambition.
    All of <i>Denali</i> consists solely of minor-key electric angst, with languid
    orchestration and predictable compositions.  No crescendos, barely discernable
    choruses, a dearth of interesting dynamics.  The result is stagnancy, kids,
    and it kills the album.</p><p>
    
    Denali aim for angst and melancholy.  Problem is, the music is supposed to
    <i>communicate</i> angst, not <i>cause</i> it.  Music that heads nowhere,
    remaining in a state of suspended animation, brings depression and anxiety
    to even the most emotionally stable. The result is a long, arduous, and yep,
    <i>angstful</i> listening experience.  If Denali were to wake up tomorrow
    with some better song ideas, you never know what could happen.  But they're
    gonna need some variation if they ever expect to make a worthwhile record.</p></div>"|2276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2276-denali/|5.8|Brad Haywood

    lust-gospel demigod Ian Svenonius (Nation of Ulysses, Make-Up) has extended his career-long tradition of
    prestigious-label-hopping and released the first-ever party album on Drag City that works.  Forget the
    learning-disabled dance-thud of King Kong or the road-to-nowhere splack of Chestnut Station; forget the
    omnipresent Drag City insincerity smirking up the fun-- this disc'll have you blaring its hits out of
    your Cutlass and smoking non-filtereds in the parking lot at Barely Legal Wings &amp; Biscuits.</p><p>
    Weird War, which includes the Make-Up's Michelle Mae and Royal Trux's Neil ""Michael"" Hagerty, debuted
    quietly on last year's indie rock opera <i>Colonel Jeffrey Pumpernickel</i> alongside Stephen Malkmus,
    Guided by Voices, Black Heart Procession, and a host of other crop-creamers.  So the band's name isn't
    purposely a reference to the current geopolitical clusterfuck (nor do I detect any references to the comic
    book <i>Weird War Tales</i>).  The song ""Weird War"" is, in fact, a lovely, folky Mae ode to doomed romance
    that calls to mind the best Kim Gordon cool-downs of the 90s.</p><p>
    The other twelve 2\xBD-minute songs, however, constitute some of the finest frenetic slop-rock of the year, a
    beefed-up cousin of the Make-Up's singles batch <i>I Want Some</i>.  The band holds a guitar clinic for
    chunky-style licks, unafraid to cop 'boogie' tones and throw crystalline pedal-fests-- you might think
    Svenonius has hijacked your local moldy-classic station. ""Burgers and Fries"" is a big-wad juke-joint take
    on the riff from the Beatles' ""Come Together"" (aka Chuck Berry's ""You Can't Catch Me"") that refrains the
    ugly bumper sticker ultimatum ""ass, cash, or grass/ Nobody rides for free""; ""Ibex Club"" boasts warped horns
    and a recorder-jam, as if Sonic Youth was conducting a frumpy Veterans' Day Parade marching band; and punk
    come-hitherings like the raucous ""Pick Up the Phone and Ball"" sure enough don't grow on trees.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, the phased-to-oblivion guitars of ""Who's Who"" burst into a bass-and-banjo bridge, and ""FN Rat""'s
    sashaying chords are simply pimpier than anything on the slow-burning <i>Save Yourself</i>.  Ian still
    wields his panic-attack howl, just shy of annoyingly, like he could way back on the Make-Up's fake live
    album when they were the only group on Dischord sporting silk shirts, and the lyrics still disguise
    pleasing him as a privilege: ""Don't kiss me on the mouth!/ When you can kiss me anywhere else.""</p><p>
    As with the Make-Up's catalog, <i>Weird War</i>'s packaging is just as entertaining as the disc.  Here
    you get a horrible cover collage that looks like one of Daniel Johnston's hellscapes: look closely for
    the fascist hedgehog with the tommy gun, General Sherman, and God getting a sensual massage from a lamb.
    The notes are an ""interview"" from <i>Hype Hair</i> magazine (consult your newsstand) in which this band
    perpetuates the Make-Up's velveteen habit of overcontextualizing their rump-shakery as heralding an
    anarchist revolution.  The manifesto is hilarious and informative, providing clues to Weird War's
    spontaneous song generation (the band professes to have followed the ""Texas Instrument Calculator theory
    of minimal circuitry and isolated components"") but also analyzes the Beatles' militarism and punk's
    emergence as ""an attempt to frighten Jackson Browne.""</p><p>
    After the White Stripes cashed in with similar retro-riff enthusiasm and schticky uniformity, and Arthur
    Lee's freedom dulled the Make-Up's anthem ""Free Arthur Lee"", I feared Svenonius's future would lead to
    inane preciousness, or worse, Ian sounding like Arsenio Hall's sketchy reverend in <i>Coming to America</i>--
    an elated husk of himself playing shows advertised as ""An Evening With...""  But with Weird War comes new,
    escapist life. The rating above is no slight; it's exactly what this unambitious high-stepper was aiming
    for. You're going to need to borrow some of the A*Team's chloroform after playing this one for your guests.</p></div>"|8617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8617-weird-war/|7.3|William Bowers

Thanks to your complete lack of faith in the essential decency of the American economy,
    Dow Jones Chairman Peter Kahn has imposed a complete revamping of the criticism industry. Things will now

    We're gonna do a little something here called ""assessing the monetary value of Aden's fourth album""-- the
    sound and songs of which, incidentally, are no different <i>whatsoever</i> from the band's already homogenous
    and uncharacteristic previous three-- ""by adding up each song's specific worth.""  Rules?</p><p>
<li> we listen to the new Aden album<p>
<li> we assign each song a monetary value based on its quality<p>

    Still confused? It's okay, stupid! You have a simplified two-digit rating located directly above all these
    abusive and perplexing words that should steer you in the right direction. No, not there. To the left.
    EXACTLY.</p><p>
    
    1) ""Intro"" / $0.01<br/>
    How disingenuous is it to have a song titled ""Intro"" lead off your album these days? Especially a half-minute,
    unaffecting organ meditation?  Not fucking very!</p><p>
    
    2) ""Racking Up Mistakes"" / $0.25<br/>
    The Elliott Smith influence begins to make its first appearances here. Unfortunately, white-bred tenor Jeff
    Gramm once again fails to invoke the lyrical or sonic intensity of his influences, leaving us with just
    another pastiche love song of needless complication.</p><p>
    
    3) ""Mango Tree"" / $0.25<br/>
    People who are not affiliated with Stuart Murdoch should not play the euphonium.  In fact, I think it's safe
    to say that Murdoch himself shouldn't play the euphonium anymore.  Show of hands?  Indeed.</p><p>
    
    4) ""Pop Song"" / $0.10<br/>
    The first real indication of inflation in Aden's world of pensive mid-tempo exercises in the key of Oui.
    Just like currency, the more of these you produce, the cheaper each one becomes.  If you've heard Aden,
    you know this one by heart.  I've thrown in a bonus nickel for how the anonymous title so accurately
    sums up both the song and the band's level of interest in playing it.  Nice imagination, guys!</p><p>
    
    5) ""River's Rising"" / $0.50<br/>
    Out of left-field (by way of Texarkana) comes this pretty and subdued piece, adorned with lazy banjo lines
    straight from a Jody Stecher record. Nothing revelatory, mind you, but at least it finds Aden drawing from
    a more esoteric musical palette.</p><p>
    
    6) ""The Chase"" / $0.10<br/>
    See ""Racking Up Mistakes"", ""Mango Tree"" and ""Pop Song""</p><p>
    
    7) ""Rapt Attention"" / $0.05<br/>

    8) Boggle Champs / $0.02<br/>

    I think you see what I'm getting at here.</p><p>
    
    Pitchfork Pricing Index: $0.29<br/>
    But what's a selfless $14.66 if it'll help kill off the media vultures at CNN who've been circling the

The mere mention
    of the words 'amp' and 'buzz'; next to each other is a Pavlovian bell causing salivation in DroneOn list
    regulars, and Ampbuzz delivers on the promise of its name, with plenty of long, extended chords to be
    savored. And yet, if you were to venture to guess what <em>kind</em> of drone music you'd expect from a band
    going by the name, you'd probably think of something subdued and quiet, with tones only slightly less
    uniform than the ones emitted by kitchen appliances. Not so with <i>This Is My Ampbuzz</i>.</p><p>
    Instead, this is dynamic, varied head music that looks back to the dawn of instrumental psychedelia for
    inspiration. Something about the vibe throughout the record seems very early 70s-- back when the Floyd
    and a few German pioneers were launching the longhairs into orbit. The retro vibe is apparent in the first
    minute of the album, as ""Bubbles"" opens with some heavily flanged keyboard squiggles that sound as though
    they come from a wire-ensnared black box the size of a small living room. The primitive nature of the
    synthetic devices on this track has a pleasantly historic trippiness that reminds me a little of Norwegian
    organist Bo Hansson's bent imaginary soundtrack to the <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.</p><p>
    Insofar as Ampbuzz is ambient, it's definitely on the darker side. The last three songs-- titled in sequence
    ""Diving Instructions"", ""Welcome to the Ocean Floor"", and ""Underwater Bomb""-- hint that this isn't going to
    be a ""let's drift gently through the clouds"" sort of ride. ""Diving Instructions"" is a slowburn track, as
    guitar feedback and cymbal clashes gradually merge into some kind of death rattle. And then ""Welcome to the
    Ocean Floor"" is claustrophobic with endlessly pulsating echoes, as guitar groans and synth pulses (there has
    to be an ARP 2600 in their somewhere) evoke a pea-soup thick tension. It takes me back to the first
    Experimental Audio Research album, another dense drone classic that sounded out of step at the time of
    its release. The closing ""Underwater Bomb"" does not detonate as promised-- instead we get a yearning
    keyboard drone coupled with some melodic, Ash Ra Tempel-style guitar leads on top.</p><p>
    In a world of anal-retentive ambient laptop music, where each sound seems meticulously designed to seem
    'alien' and difficult to place, Ampbuzz records an evocative instrumental album where all the sounds come
    from gear designed for making music. Guitars and assorted modular synths do the bulk of the work, I imagine,
    and the sleeve indicates that everything was recorded to \xBD-inch tape. I'm not sure if it works in spite of
    its throwback nature or because of it, but these frayed and slightly crude tracks sound damn refreshing.</p></div>"|171.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/171-this-is-my-ampbuzz/|7.2|Mark Richardson

They're not just Maxell XLIIs with fuzzy recordings of that acoustic Smashing Pumpkins Tower
    Records appearance anymore!  Bootlegs!  Compilations of which are finding their way onto even the most
    esteemed criticos' mid-year best-of lists!  Bootlegs!  Their pissing-on-copyright-laws approach poetically
    mirrors-- and is, one might argue, made possible by-- the wonders of digital file-sharing!  Bootlegs!</p><p>
    Quasi-anonymous 2 Many DJs are the kings of the bootleg mountain.  Otherwise known as Soulwax, the Belgian
    duo (brothers Stephen and David Dewaele) has released some of the genre's most popular MP3s, many of
    which sprang to notoriety after being posted to Boomselection, the web's primary resource for this new
    music.  <i>As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt 2</i> is their first full-length release as bootleggers (they
    actually started out as a rock band), but genre classification aside, the album is really just a very
    cohesive, hour-long DJ mix.  This incarnation of the 25-year-old artform, however, seems to be kicking
    up quite a bit of fuss amongst those 'in the know.'  But what's the big deal?  According to my analysis,
    four incredibly deep, insightful conclusions can be reached from the album's content:</p><p>
    1) All popular music is, by definition, pop music.</p><p>
    This has been the manifesto of the bootleg movement from day one, or at least since the Freelance
    Hellraiser's ""A Stroke of Genius"" started making the Internet rounds.  Effortlessly merging the biggest
    hits of Christina Aguilera and The Strokes played a galactic prank on the hipsters of the world, showing
    that their latest pet band was just a few mouse clicks away from being the latest teenie pop sample loop.
    Nothing on <i>Radio Soulwax</i> is quite so subversive, but the integration of the thick-glasses crowd's
    favorite bands-- the Velvet Underground, The Breeders, The Stooges-- into what's basically a club house mix
    might ruffle some feathers.  Who would've known ""I'm Waiting for My Man"" was just a Sly &amp; The Family Stone
    tambourine away from being a party anthem?  Who'd've thunk ""No Fun"" or ""Cannonball"" wrapped so perfectly
    around aged rap tracks from Salt N' Pepa and Skee-Lo?  Nobody, actually, and that's part of the fun.</p><p>
    2) DJ mixes are <i>not</i> just a novelty.</p><p>
    Beyond this valiant mission, the dexterous wrists of 2 Many DJs appear to strive for even higher, more
    artistically lofty accomplishments with their mix.  Witness, for example, the middle 20 minutes of the
    album, a movement largely devoid of mainstream-recognizable tunes.  Dropping music from the household-name
    likes of Funkacise Gang, Alphawezen, and Zongamin, the duo slaps rhythm against rhythm in calculated
    haphazardry, creating new sounds sure to earn ever-more-arcane classifications from the self-appointed
    genre taxonomists.  You might argue such experimentation is instant death to the album's boogie-boogie
    purpose, and is even <yawn> a bit middling.  Or you might argue that I and others are convincing ourselves
    of this objective's presence in order to wax intellectual about a pop music collection.  On certain
    occasions, I'd be obliged to agree with you.</yawn></p><p>
    3) DJ mixes <i>are</i> just a novelty.</p><p>
    Because really: Dolly Parton into Rokysopp?  Early New Order vs. house sleazeballs Detroit Grand Pubahs?
    These are combinations designed to provoke disbelief and mirth on the first listen-- which they do,
    admirably.  But thereafter, as with the vast majority of DJ mixes, the Law of Diminishing Entertainment
    Returns applies more readily-- these krazy kombos are certainly worth the download-time to hear at least
    once, but the audio trickery wears out fast.  Compounding the problem is the inclusion of fairly pointless
    pre-processed kitsch, like the techno covers of ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" and ELO's falsetto favorite ""Don't
    Bring Me Down"".  Choosing to include the electro-fied versions of <i>other</i> mixing board pranksters is
    surely an odd decision, and resembles smirking in a hall of mirrors, with all the fun-or-headache debate
    that implies.  So what's the real, overarching über-purpose?</p><p>
    4) Hire us for remixes!</p><p>
    And hell, don't assume from our web address that I think there's anything wrong with a little self-promotion!
    2 Many DJs show off their renovatin' stuff on <i>Radio Soulwax</i>, and their stuff ain't too shabby.
    Witness Destiny's Child's TRL fave ""Independent Women Pt 1,"" transformed into a 70s lite-funk groover by
    the addition of 10cc's ""Dreadlock Holiday.""  (Mere coincidence that Beyonce's movie-driven first solo step
    had similar funktastical leanings?)  The duo also definitively proves that nothing goes with the gleefully
    self-aware over-the-top house of Basement Jaxx like the hilariously oblivious prog of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.
    The hybridization of ""Where's Your Head At"" and a live take on ""Theme from 'Peter Gunn'"" has got BANG!-- you
    can already envision Pringles' ad execs riffling their Rolodexes.</p><p>
    Despite all my hypothesizing and yelling about stuff, I concede that <i>Radio Soulwax</i> is a good time.
    I don't know that it's groundbreaking, beyond the fact that whatever this bootlegging craze is the start
    of could eventually yield fantastic results.  At this point, though, all I hear is a temporary house-party
    enhancer that, while fun for a while, isn't the kind of thing you're going to come back to in five years
    (or even two) to find that it's withstood the test of time.  Enjoy it while you can.</p></div>"|8228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8228-as-heard-on-radio-soulwax-pt-2/|7.6|Rob Mitchum

    who have compromised their artistic integrity to appease A&amp;R; men and ""move units"" of their latest releases.
    But sometimes, a band is just plain accessible-- no compromising, no 'selling out,' no conspiracy.  And
    face it: there are days when La Monte Young is just too extravagantly post-modern for your mood and Acid
    Mothers' blacklight psychedelia simply freaks you out.  Sparta, friends.  That's all I'm saying.</p><p>
    
    Jim Ward, Paul Hinojos and Tony Hajjar have kept in practice since At the Drive-In called for an ""indefinite
    hiatus"" last year, and their debut album as Sparta, <i>Wiretap Scars</i>, seems out to prove just that.
    Their aesthetic, of course, is somewhat different than At the Drive-In's; where ATDI was a surge of fried
    distortion and frayed, twisted nerves communicated through ruthless aggression and synaptic attacks, Sparta
    are (you guessed it) more accessible in every department: their music bursts with solid hooks, their
    production has been given a good shine, and, with the spotlight turned away from Cedric Bixler and Omar
    Rodriguez, they even <i>look</i> more like standard-fare indie everymen with nondiscript t-shirts and
    normal-guy haircuts.</p><p>
    
    True, Sparta probably doesn't stand a chance against ATDI in the originality department-- their sound is,
    frankly, like At the Drive-In crossed with pretty much every guitar-centric group fortunate enough to make
    it past the Clear Channel family-filters.  Yet, despite this, they've managed to broaden the nervous-tic
    angst-rock of their previous band into something more readily adaptable without reducing it to mealy-mouthed
    pop regurge.  Because of this, <i>Wiretap Scars</i> does lack some of the screamy immediacy of
    <i>Relationship of Command</i>, but it's certainly more balanced.</p><p>
    
    That Ward's frantic guitar lines haven't changed much since the last time he went down on record won't make
    any headlines, and since his guitar sets the tone for the majority of the album-- well, you Young Sherlock
    Holmeses have probably already solved <i>that</i> mystery.  Sparta's real 'film at eleven'-sized surprise,
    however, isn't the musical similarity to their parent group, but how closely Ward's vocals stick to Cedric
    Bixler's signature formula.  Now, I love me some ATDI, but I never much cared for Bixler's, uh, vocalizing,
    and Ward refines Cedric's style to more of a ""quiet/loud/quiet/gyaaaah"" sort of thing that sits a bit better
    with me.  His throatly howl skirts along the edge (arms flailing, pebbles falling, toes over the edge--
    <i>that</i> close to going over) of the dreaded precipice of ""emo"" or ""screamo"" or ""just someone please put
    a fucking bullet in my skull""-- whatever media whores like myself are calling it these days.  Fortunately,
    Ward avoids full-on cord-shredding, so even the shouts keep hold of the melody.</p><p>
    
    But back to the instruments, shall we?  I might have browbeaten this ATDI vs Sparta bit enough by now, but
    I'm just going with what's applicable-- and just as the vocals sound like a more melodic (yet equally
    intense) take on The Drive-Ins, the music has been filtered through about 50 kHz of radio bandwidth.  That
    is, the bass pounds a little heavier, the skins hit a little cleaner, and the guitars are a bit more direct,
    and all in the most unobtrusive way possible.  But the biggest change is that Sparta are less concerned with
    noise and screeching feedback-- <i>Wiretap Scars</i> is straightforward, nervy rock, and its delicate,
    tension-fueled atmosphere doesn't leave much room for ATDI's poised-on-the-brink brand of unsteadiness or
    ultra-dense structures.  Still, all this traveling lighter comes at a cost of its own, leaving Sparta
    somewhat lacking at times.</p><p>
    
    Of course, music that pushes boundaries or challenges the listener tends to have more staying power, and
    Sparta most assuredly do neither.  You're likely to hear any number of these tracks (notably ""Cataract""
    or ""Sans Cosm"") riding the questionable coattails of such crowdpleasers as Nickelback and Mest on ""Total
    Request Live"".  But this, magically, fails to diminish <i>Wiretap Scars</i>, since there are still a few
    tracks 'difficult' enough to never hit the major media outlets.  ""Cut Your Ribbon"" is simply splintering,
    power-hungry rock, showcasing the record's most memorable vocals, and the immediate follow-up, ""Air"",
    employs languid electronic backing tones and a strong contrast of moods before building to a breakneck
    chorus.</p><p>
<i>Scars</i> seldom slows its pace, receding only a couple of times for a mid-tempo breather, and, to put
    it in as direct terms as possible, it's damn fun.  Sparta have made what seems to be a conscious decision
    to forsake innovation in the name of refinement, and they handle it well, never coming off like the
    almost-ran ATDI retreads they had such potential to.  And come to think of it, <i>Wiretap Scars</i> isn't
    even particularly unchallenging-- the band just chooses to issue their challenge to wind instead of smashing
    their listeners in the chops.  Which, at last, proves the age-old adage that music doesn't always haven't
    to bust your jaw to get your attention.</p></div>"|7404.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7404-wiretap-scars/|7.2|Eric Carr

    starred in the minor indie hit <i>Buffalo '66</i>.  But Gallo also has a sketchy music career that predates
    his acting.  Check out the bio on his <a href=""http://www.vincentgallo.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>website</u></a>, where you
    can laugh at his feeble attempts to 'shock' you with his casual slurs against blacks, Jews, and redheads.
    (""By the way, did you ever notice the smell of redheads? I think that's why a lot of redhead girls have
    Black boyfriends.  They smell compatible."")  In New York City in the '70s, he played clubs like CBGB's in a
    band with Jean-Michel Basquiat.  But that band broke up, and to quote Gallo, ""a month later [Basquiat] was
    a millionaire art star. Sometimes it's good to be Black.""  Yeah, and having talent doesn't suck, either.</p><p>
    
    This new release on Warp Records sells Gallo's music on the back of his film career.  <i>Recordings of Music
    for Film</i> includes the soundtracks, written and performed by Gallo, from four of his movies: <i>The Way
    It Is</i> (1978), <i>If You Feel Froggy, Jump</i> (1979), <i>Downtown '81</i> (1981), and the only one you'll
    find at the video store, <i>Buffalo '66</i> (1998).  I don't make a habit of listening to film scores any
    more than I sit around flipping through set design books or looking at lighting plans.  Too often the music
    can't stand on its own, and it expects us to cut it some slack because we know it's a subordinate work.
    Gallo's scores are a textbook example: they're made of successfully moody background music that's just
    <i>awfully</i> tedious on an hour-long disc.</p><p>
    
    It's been a while since I watched <i>Buffalo '66</i>, yet I still remember the flat, grey shots of that grim
    city, whose last renaissance died on the slogan ""Buffalo Has Wings!""  <i>Recordings of Music for Film</i>'s
    only strength is that it achieves the same dreariness, assisted by the lo-fi recording (it sounds like it
    was mostly mastered from vinyl) which rubs any brightness from the sound.  But moodiness can't carry the
    album.  The pieces each sound dully repetitive-- it's as if Gallo found a way to make each instrument sound
    creepy and just stopped there.  The playing meanders-- a loosely strummed guitar, woodblocks clacking,
    synthesizers sustaining, and the occasional horn, like the whistling tea-kettle sax sound on ""Ass Fucker"",
    or the more graceful clarinet on ""Her Smell Theme"", one of the few pieces with a melody.</p><p>
    
    The tracks from <i>Buffalo '66</i> are the most inventive, including the dreamy synth layers of ""A Wet
    Cleaner"", and the muffled bump-and-grind ""Drowning in Brown"" that could have been recorded in an alley
    behind a nightclub. The singer on ""Lonely Boy"" sounds mortally creepy, sounding dazed as she wanders
    through the cracked lyrics: ""Daddy, you sure eat a lot of snacks...""  This is Gallo's album, so he leaves
    out the movie's best song-- ""Heart of the Sunrise"" by Yes-- but at least he cribs from ""Roundabout"" on
    ""With Smiles &amp; Smiles &amp; Smiles"": he copies (but dumbs down) Steve Howe's acoustic intro, and hearing it
    is like listening to some guy down the hall who practices the song over and over and over again but never
    gets it right.</p><p>
    
    And that's the biggest problem with <i>Recordings of Music for Film</i>: it sounds like a home studio project,
    a whole album of ideas that sound almost-clever but go absolutely fucking nowhere.  Nothing's compelling,
    the performance is, when at its best, average, and although the atmosphere is as thick as muddy slush, that
    gets old fast.  Gallo may have cred in the movie business, but as a recording artist, he's still just ""that
    guy who was in a band with Basquiat.""</p></div>"|3385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3385-recordings-of-music-for-film/|2.9|Chris Dahlen

That girl at work you've had
    your eye on agrees to get a beer with you, you're happy. That same girl,
    after seeing you regularly for a few months, decides she's not attracted to
    you and tells you so, you're sad. You find out this girl, the one you saw
    for a while there, was lying to you and actually found someone new but
    didn't have the guts to tell you, you're angry. You wake up the morning
    after hearing this terrible news in a dried pool of your own vomit, with a
    CD by hair farmers Junkyard blaring on repeat, you feel disgust, wondering
    how in the hell Brian Baker used to be in Minor Threat. We've all been there.</p><p>
    
    Then there are the moments where a few different feelings tug at you
    simultaneously, and you feel uncertain and confused. This discordant state
    is at the heart of these Kepler songs. Ottawa's slowcore maestros, who
    opened for Godspeed You Black Emperor! on a European tour earlier this year,
    find that kernel of doubt in the happy moment and the edge of comfort in
    sadness, and blow the swirling mess up to billboard size. These songs are
    brimming with such internal conflict.</p><p>
    
    ""Let Us Rest as Mutes"" has the kind of songwriting focus I'm talking about.
    It's a weary plea for sleep addressed to the girl at the narrator's side,
    begging her not to pay attention to his bitchy quips: ""Darling, I implore you
    to ignore my foolish taunts,"" he sings. ""The words I speak are nothing but
    decoration for my wrongs."" Anyone who's ever launched into a stupid fight at
    1:00am can relate to the closing line, ""Tonight I'm begging, baby, let us
    rest as fucking mutes for one last time."" The very spare and Low-like ""A
    Workhorse,"" is another lament for rest, with nuggets of surreal detail like,
    ""Walking up my street, I catch the 22-hour nightspot on siesta: waitresses
    asleep on tables and floors.""</p><p>
    
    On <i>Missionless Days</i>, Kepler sounds paradoxically both more careful and
    more confident. The melodies and arrangements are meticulously constructed,
    with instrumental touches like piano and organ now fully integrated into the
    two-guitar/bass/drum sound-- yet they never sound fussy, and the songs
    seem to fall in place naturally. Kepler's secret weapon is John Higney, who
    contributes gorgeous lap steel to a handful of tracks, lending an airy, high
    lonesome sound to <i>Missionless Days</i>. The record breathes. Esteemed
    Pitchfork editor Ryan Schreiber concluded his review of Kepler's last effort
    on Troubleman Unlimited <i>Fuck Fight Fail</i> by saying, ""...the boys have
    got promise, and their next album will likely shock this one into submission.""
    He was on the money.</p></div>"|4402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4402-missionless-days/|7.8|Mark Richardson

Like, your
    conventional pop material is there, except that's <i>all</i> there is-- everything is stripped back to clean,
    functional lines, like a more elaborate version of a Mondrian painting. Is there a term for that? Because
    that's what Track Star do.</p><p>
    
    You might know Track Star's Wyatt Cusick from indie-pop darlings the Aislers Set, whose <i>The Last March</i>
    he played bass and sang a couple songs on. Track Star is sort of 'his' project, and they don't sound a whole
    lot like the Aislers: less frilly, less twee, and they don't go for the Byrdsy ""San Francisco sound"" the
    Aislers do. If they sound like anyone from the area it's Imperial Teen, who use the same trick-warm guitars,
    songs clicking or jangling along on just a few chords, every melody very deliberately meant as a hook, mood
    going from bratty to precious by turns. Imperial Teen do it more flashily and interestingly, but the odd
    thing about Track Star is that it's precisely their lack of being interesting that makes them charming.</p><p>
    
    I honestly mean that. Their first album was called <i>Communication Breaks</i>-- I've just realized that its
    cover really does look like ""a more elaborate version of a Mondrian painting""-- and it was this great, slow
    sleeper: not a lot seemed to be going on in it, but it made excellent company. Bits were whispery, bits were
    punkily fizzy and speedy. Mostly, it had a casual quality that could break amusingly forward-- one track was
    just unison shouting and acoustic guitar abuse, and another got through a verse worth of pop-hit material
    before the guys decided to try on their metal yells. Even the lyrics had this weird charm-- deliberately
    conventional, bald-faced, and almost cleverly just-there. It started like this: ""There are three ideas in
    my head/ One's to suck on fumes til I'm dead/ One's to cover the city in flames/ And one's to run to the
    roof/ And then shout out your name.""</p><p>
    
    Whereas this album is, like, mature, which at points is a shame and at points is commendable. The same
    process takes place: the songs start off seeming massively boring-- like by-numbers paintings done only in
    primary colors-- but gradually reveal themselves to be pretty fascinating on some near-subliminal level.
    And the newly 'sophisticated' writing-- meaning 'still less sophisticated than most bands'-- sometimes works
    itself into a rigidly arranged sweetness that's reminiscent of recent Ladybug Transistor, with hooks that
    originally seemed a bit lame eventually seeming near-brilliantly subtle.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, a lot of the hooks really aren't as good, even the ones borrowed from the last record.
    And Matthew Troy, who has a very poor voice indeed, is given a really unconscionable amount of space to
    inflict it upon us. Thus, a lot of the moments which make Track Star sound like more than just a side
    project-- ""The One We Play"", which fills in for prime Kleenexgirlwonder now that Graham Smith's gone dumb,
    or the terrific tag-team of ""Goodbye to the Dream"" and ""Something to Do""-- get balanced to zero by plodding
    drags like ""Amy Tell Me Why"" and ""Cross Country"".  At points, Track Star seem as likeable as Unrest. At
    points, they make me feel like a chump for having typed that.</p><p>
    
    Regardless, I keep throwing both this and <i>Communication Breaks</i> on. Casually, between things I actually
    <i>want</i> to listen to. And I keep being interested in something in there, something about an indie-pop
    band that doesn't seem to be trying anything at all. They might be the best sneakily boring-sounding band
    in the world-- and so long as I can't quite figure out whether that's a compliment or not, I'll probably
    keep listening.</p></div>"|8126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8126-lion-destroyed-the-whole-world/|6.6|Nitsuh Abebe

My senior one, to be
    specific.  Said prom was planned by a girl I will call 'Dance Team'
    (because she was on the dance team). Irony of all ironies, Dance
    Team would soon merit the alias 'Lazybones'.  Due to her sluggish
    planning regimen, when she finally got around to booking a venue, all
    local hotels had been reserved for potential prom weekends. What
    that meant was Sunday night prom in the auxiliary gym, three weeks
    before graduation. Not exactly a night to remember.</p><p>
    
    Sunday prom in the 'aux gym' raised a massive ruckus with two distinct
    groups.  First, there were the Mormons, whose parents would have
    allowed them to attend a Sunday event, but only on the express
    condition that they refrain from 'having fun' (fun is verboten on
    Mormon Sundays). Then there was me and my not-yet-gay but very
    effeminate best friend, who were pre-committed to compete in Quiz
    Bowl nationals. Out of a sense of injustice and a disdain for Dance
    Team/Lazybones, we joined forces with the Mormons and complained our
    asses off. But to no fricking avail. Prom happened, it sucked, and
    we went out a week later with 12 of our closest Mormon friends and a
    party van.</p><p>
    
    Eight years later and I'm back at it, complaining about the Prom,
    but this time without Mormon assistance. The Prom of which I speak
    today is an indie pop group from Seattle, Washington. Like Mormon
    Sundays, this Prom lacks the fun quotient. Melancholy pervades what
    ought to be the good-time formula of piano, drums, and bass. It sounds
    like Ben Folds Five, minus the virtuoso piano and bass ability, and
    substituting Elliott Smith for Folds on vocals (albeit with a bit
    less talent in the melody department, and a bit more talent in the
    lyrics department).</p><p>
    
    ""Guarantees Aren't Easy"" features a tense, punchy and dramatic
    bassline, playing off an insistent piano arpeggio, to distinguish
    itself as the most affecting and profound song on the album. ""Ink on
    the Paper"" is another of the more dynamic tunes on the album,
    employing strings and flute to throw a nice closing hook in your
    face.  Beyond that, however, The Prom offers a bunch of glimmers and
    sparkles, but can't seem to put a complete song together.  With the
    instrumentation fairly basic and the orchestration consistent, the
    onus is placed on the dynamics of the songs and the quality of
    melodies. The Prom occasionally capitalizes on a solid sense of song
    dynamics (as on the aforementioned ""Guarantees"" and ""Ink on the
    Paper). Unfortunately, they can't boast the same about melody.</p><p>
    
    The Prom's lack of facility with the catchy vocal hook, or even a
    catchy piano hook (piano is truly fertile ground for them) is
    painfully evident, and ultimately weighs down their debut. It's
    most obvious on the more naked slow tunes, like ""A Note on the
    Kitchen Table"" and ""Brighter than the Moon"", each of which feels
    laggard and bloated.  Moreover, the lack of melody further continues
    the fun drought. Add sad lyrics and you're in sad shape all around.
    Melancholy minus hooks equals drab to the boringth power. Like I
    said, not exactly a night to remember.</p></div>"|6491.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6491-under-the-same-stars/|6.8|Brad Haywood

Or so say the folks whose job it is to shovel
    coal into the ol' hype engine. But then, there's this tendency in the music press to judge DJ Spooky not for
    the music he makes, but for that music's effect on some large yet ephemeral scene, the whereabouts of which
    no one seems capable of putting their finger on. Of course, being the intelligent, sophisticated music nerds
    we are, you and I know that's just plain silly-- just as it would be silly to pan <i>Optometry</i> because
    it never quite accomplishes the lofty goals it aims for.</p><p>
    
    The latest in Thirsty Note's Blue Series (an ongoing attempt to both sell the concept of jazz to a young
    crowd of would-be hipsters too busy prodding at their Powerbooks to pay attention to jazz, and to sell the
    concept of electronics + jazz to a grizzled bunch of old fundamentalists who see no place for computers
    anywhere near a stage or a studio), Spooky's <i>Optometry</i> borrows its concept, and most of its players,
    from another Blue Series release: Matthew Shipp's recent <i>Nu Bop</i>. While both records place Shipp and
    his fellow New York jazzhounds (William Parker, Guillermo E. Brown) alongside New York electronic scenesters,
    <i>Optometry</i>'s results are a bit stronger. Though <i>Nu Bop</i> had its fair share of solid tunes, it
    often seemed like the electronics were tacked on as an afterthought; on <i>Optometry</i>, Spooky plays the
    role of bandleader and producer.  (And turntablist. And bassist. And guy in the studio with a kalimba.) As
    a result, the mix is a bit more evenhanded.</p><p>
    
    Not that you'd guess it from the first couple of tracks.  <i>Optometry</i>'s opening ten minutes fits the
    <i>Nu Bop</i> mold pretty well. Shipp, Parker and a couple of pals burst in with their usual aplomb. There
    are quick flourishes of these ee-leck-tricks I keep hearing about-- buzzing or a hint of delay here, field
    recordings of trucks passing there-- but Spooky doesn't make his presence fully felt until the third track,
    ""Variation Cybernetique: Rhythmic Pataphysic (Part I)"", where Daniel Bernard Roumain's violin weeps over a
    long ambient soundscape built from processed piano. This is the first of two intermissions, and it signifies
    a move from the ordinary to the adventurous.</p><p>
    
    Spooky opens the next segment with ""Asphalt (Tome II)"", a collaboration with Pauline Oliveros (how's that
    for cred?) and spoken word artist Carl Hancock Rux. A finger piano is struck and a glitchified soundscape
    that sounds pilfered and processed from the preceding track unfolds. Shipp adds a repeating piano phrase
    and Brown drops a standard hip-hop boom-bip just as Rux's velvet-smooth voice appears in the mix. ""I got
    two turntables and Coltrane,"" he says. ""And not just <i>Blue</i> Coltrane. And not just Monk and not just
    Miles. I've got a million musicians playing over my head, a band of angels responding to the percussion of
    stomps and hollers. Heads don't even know what's happening to 'em; they just know something's happening to
    'em."" Soon the jam's transforms into a hip-hop chorus, a wailing saxophone, a furiously scratched record,
    a storm of ambient whooshes. And then there's that boom-bip again. And a bassline. And Rux's voice. Later,
    Shipp and Parker interact over an ambient portion that sees all the song's components breaking down into
    something entirely new, entirely different.</p><p>
    
    So is this jazz? Spoken word? Hip-hop? Sound collage? I sure don't know. And if you asked any of the artists
    involved what <i>they'd</i> call this music, my guess is they'd shrug and mutter, ""Who the hell cares?"" The
    world has more than its fair share of closed-minded individuals who care about things like genres, who scoff
    when they see a laptop on stage, who openly equate turntablism with plagiarism. But this record wasn't made
    for them. <i>Optometry</i>'s intent, it would seem, is to celebrate the meeting of new worlds-- not to
    appease those who would rather see them remain separate.</p><p>
    
    The title track opens with abstract drumming and an assortment of synth burps, the newness of which is
    countered by the ancient mutterings of Roumain's violin. Shipp and tenor saxophonist Joe McPhee join in,
    though their simple and repetitive parts arise suspicion. Are they playing live or is Spooky constructing
    a jam that never happened out of pieces of tape and long strings of ones and zeroes? The pre-recorded
    breakbeat which fades in and out of the proceedings only adds to the uncertainty.  But uncertainty is, of
    course, the point. In the album's liner notes, Spooky rambles about sampling, rearranging, and reinventing
    music, reveling in the new doors opened by new technology. He wants us to question whether we're hearing
    'the real thing' or not.  And after that, he wants us to wonder why it really matters.</p><p>
    
    Rather than just make an album that merges a few different techniques or genres, Spooky has made a point of
    calling attention to it. This self-awareness casts <i>Optometry</i> as a potentially significant album,
    acting simultaneously as its Achilles' heel. Ultimately, Spooky casts himself as ringleader to a revolution
    that fails to happen-- after the initial bustle of a few extremely strong tracks, <i>Optometry</i> wanders
    blindly for far too long. For someone so obsessed with his own place in an ongoing transformation, Spooky
    too often seems reluctant to jump into the swimming pool.</p><p>
    
    Closer ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World"" bursts open with a maelstrom of saxophone loops, glitched-out samples
    and feedback. Shipp and friends try repeatedly to kick out the jams, but Spooky keeps interrupting, garbling
    waveforms, fucking with minds. <i>Optometry</i> needs more tracks like this, and fewer tracks like ""Rosemary"",
    where Spooky's sole input seems to be the creation of an ambient canvas for the other musicians to paint on.
    Granted, Shipp's quartet here are fine players. Granted, their improvisations are pleasing to the air and
    musically quite sound. And granted, there's something to be said for subtlety and respect. But all this talk
    of new sounds has me anxious to hear more lines being crossed. It's not that I dislike what I'm hearing; it's
    just that I've heard it before.</p><p>
<i>Optometry</i> is certainly an adequate fusion, and its taste lasts a lot longer than did <i>Nu Bop</i>'s.
    When it works, it's actually quite fucking stunning. But <i>Optometry</i> will not ignite the metamorphosis
    it threatens to. It will not send the world's jazz purists scouring the IDM lists in search of new
    collaborators. Nor will it pull too many heads from the stale paper smell of the record crates or the eerie
    white glow of their laptops. What it <i>will</i> do is entertain open-minded types who don't expect too much
    from it. Call it intermission music for the revolution.</p></div>"|2385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2385-optometry/|7.5|David M. Pecoraro

    double issues, the VH1 theme weeks, the Tower Records special displays.  Condescending, patronizing bullshit,
    all of it.  Now, I won't get into the issue of the built-in misogyny in the rock criticism phrasebook;
    partially because I wouldn't want to endorse a paranoid shift towards excessively vigilant political
    correctness, and partially because I myself am guilty of occasionally over-using the adjective 'sultry.'</p><p>
    
    No, at hand is a bigger fish-- namely, that far too much writing about female musicians gets caught up
    with the idea that the artist must be saying something about the 'female experience.'  Rather than accept
    these acts as just plain musicians, being a woman playing rock music is automatically assumed to be a
    declaration of activist intentions.  Other than the obvious double-standard (when was the last time you
    read a review about an all-guy band's songs reflecting the male experience?), this allows the Y
    chromosome-dominated rock press to focus on gender while still coming off as enlightened.  But what of
    those girl bands that just want to rock, without all that role model jazz?</p><p>
    
    Consider, for example, indie-rock darlings Sleater-Kinney, just coincidentally the subject of this review!
    To date, Sleater-Kinney has, in my professional opinion, been a good but not great band with a solid back
    catalog of energetic but slightly homogenous releases.  To the majority of my esteemed colleagues, however,
    S-K is the three-headed coming of the woman Christ, The Great Female Hope, the band that proves at long last
    that, hey, girls can rawk too!  Never mind the fact that girls are, after all, evolutionarily engineered to
    have fingers for making chord shapes and strumming, just like boys.</p><p>
    
    Saddled with such a heavy label, and with unrealistic and undeserved expectations, the three women of
    Sleater-Kinney could just keep on making the same album over and over again, pleasing their tiny, rabid
    loyalists and the leather-patched elbow crowd in the press box.  Hey, the life ain't too bad for a cult
    band these days.  But, thank god, the Kill Rock Stars trio isn't content to forever meander in that habitat.
    With <i>One Beat</i>, Sleater-Kinney have turned in an album that absolutely, positively OBLITERATES the
    gender card, an album so colossal that all prefixes to the label 'rock band' must be immediately discarded.</p><p>
    
    From the opening, off-kilter drum pattern of the title track, <i>One Beat</i> takes you on a log flume ride
    through a forest of monumental riffs-- a log flume ride, people!  Witness the fretboard slides of ""Hollywood
    Ending"", the cocky strut of ""Step Aside"", the mighty, fist-pumping second half of ""Combat Rock"" (to which
    I'd like to just give a premature Forkie for Best Riff of the Year right now).  Also, be forewarned that the
    drumstick-twirling coda of ""Far Away"" has been shown to provoke sudden miming of snare hits and windmill
    strums in laboratory animals.</p><p>
    
    Now, you might be hearing a lot of crazytalk from longtime S-K supporters that the new album is their most
    disappointing to date.  Ignore it; fanbase discomfort is a common symptom of the breakthrough album, proving
    that the act has tweaked their formula far enough to piss off the vets who want their pet band to stay
    predictable.  Kinney's definitely changed up the recipe (as they had already begun to do with <i>All Hands
    on the Bad One</i>), but all changes are positive, foremost being a new understanding of how restraint and
    scaling back can allow for exponentially increased rockage.  ""Combat Rock"" and ""The Remainder"" stutter along
    a single riff, teasingly refusing to explode before building to a tantric peak.  ""Light Rail Coyote"" and
    ""O2"" both come out with all engines blazing, but retreat to valleys of uncharacteristically subdued hush.</p><p>
    
    Also helping the cause is an increased singing role for Carrie Brownstein, who sounds more confident than
    ever sporting a fully developed hiccupy vocal character that plays off Tucker's wail like lime flavoring
    on Tostitos.  For anyone of the opinion that Tucker's banshee act occasionally got out of hand on older
    S-K material, Brownstein's participation is welcome news for your fragile eardrums.  The latest model of
    the Janet Weiss percussion-cyborg sings a bit, too, but her main contribution is her incredibly melodic
    drums, strident and full-bodied as ever.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, the band breaks out the required fifth-album accoutrements: horn section, strings, occasional
    keyboards.  It might be predictable timing for the band to expand their sound, but it's handled delicately
    by producer John Goodmanson, who never allows the spice to overwhelm the dish (er, sonically speaking, of
    course).  The slip-and-slide Moog on ""Oh!"" drives home the song's oh-woah-woah playfulness, ""Step Aside""'s
    marching band brass lends its revolution beckoning an epic quality, and Sam Coomes' theremin on ""Funeral
    Song"" fulfills the FDA requirements for any tune that mentions haunted houses, demons, and Halloween.</p><p>
    
    So except for a closing track (""Sympathy"") where the bluesy over-emoting reminds me of everything I used to
    dislike about the Sleater, <i>One Beat</i> is an uncompromising, energetic monster of a record.  Most of
    all, it's just accessible (pardon my French) enough to be exactly what the rock world needs these days:
    the Trail of Dead for those put off by the Danzig-esque lyrics and relentless drum-rolling.  It's a
    dive-headfirst-into-an-empty-pool, take-the-subway-to-Queens, snap-into-a-Slim-Jim, forget-to-bring-back the-library-books,
    tire-pressure-dangerously-low, sneaking-fireworks-across-the-Illinois-Indiana-border kind of album.  That
    it's performed by three persons of the female gender is entirely beside the point, to anyone who's really
    listening.</p></div>"|7237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7237-one-beat/|9.1|Rob Mitchum

I'm just coming to terms with the man myself, though
    I will report steady progress on that front.  After years of discovering the
    ins and outs of life and music, and more than my share of mistakes with
    both, I had come to a point where I thought I was prepared for just about
    anything.  That is, until Ryan sent me this CD, and I found out that not
    only had I been caught unaware of the songs, I hadn't really ever known Dom
    Leone at all.  In this case, I thought it best to start fresh with an
    introduction to the guy.</p><p>
    
    As much as I'd have liked to say I got a CD of my own music reviewed at
    Pitchfork (written by myself, in a double-reverse coup of the site's
    integrity), I must admit that <i>Guess Who This Is</i> is actually a
    tribute to the late co-founder of eclectic folk-rockers Ed's Redeeming
    Qualities.  Leone died of cancer in 1989, shortly before the band released
    its first full-length, <i>More Bad Times</i>, on Flying Fish.  Judging by
    the songs on this set, his quirky brand of folk, incorporating aspects of
    country, rock and lots of humor (as well as kitchen-sink instrumentation)
    found lots of ways to inform the sound of the band.  <i>Guess Who This Is</i>
    collects performances of family, friends and bandmates playing several of
    Leone's songs, and makes the case that he might have been one of the brighter
    spots in 90s alternative music-- especially in light of the popularity of
    bands like Uncle Tupelo and Wilco.</p><p>
    
    Now, we all know that tribute albums are usually no good for two reasons: 1)
    they're comprised of b-list bands performing third-rate versions of songs by
    artists who were probably dead in the public consciousness long before they
    got their tribute; and 2) the performances, already of little interest to
    anyone but hyper-fanatics, rarely stand any chance of elaborating on original
    versions.  <i>Guess Who This Is</i> is able to withstand those criticisms almost
    in spite of itself: the bands are most likely completely unfamiliar to anyone
    but each other, and the tributee only slightly less so.  So, you could think
    of this as Dom Leone's debut record.</p><p>
    
    Leone seemed to have specialized in the mundane observances we take for
    granted, and spun them into short, poignant vignettes.  ""More Bad Times"",
    performed by Curtis Harvey (of Loftus), laments having not enough tragic
    moments to a gentle country waltz.  Harvey's wobbly whine suits the easy
    protest perfectly, and accordion, slide guitar and plaintive piano lend the
    tune an elegant veneer.  ""Guess Who This Is"" offers a similar listing
    technique, but applied to the details of several different people (or
    perhaps several sides of one person).  Its loosely defiant tempo and
    balladeering, modern folk style is handled expertly by The Buckets
    (featuring Early Butter, who played with an early version of The Breeders,
    who in turn covered the Ed's Redeeming Qualities tune ""Drivin' on 9"" on
    <i>Last Splash</i>).</p><p>
    
    Where this disc is likely to fall short with newcomers to Leone's music is
    in the occasional lapses into over-preciousness.  Music Night's performance
    of ""My Apartment"" is cute the first time, but the singer's monotone vocal
    and the goofy steel drums get a bit over-precious after a while.  Similarly,
    the horn-driven ""Song Nancy Hates"" and ""Sweater"" seem more kiddie-show silly
    than merely whimsical.</p><p>
    
    Dom Leone never got a chance to hear these songs performed in front of a
    wider audience than his local New Hampshire fans.  For those people, this
    release will undoubtedly be a warm reunion with a clearly inspired observer.
    To the rest of you strangers, feel free to make yourself at home.  This
    music isn't likely to set hearts aflame with incendiary passion and drama,
    but for a summer evening on the back porch, it could strike your chord.</p></div>"|4742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4742-guess-who-this-is-a-tribute-to-dom-leone/|6.5|Dominique Leone

    returns with zeal to the noisier, more abstract territory of his Thrill Jockey debut <i>Scope</i>.
    The material on <i>Water's Suite</i> was originally recorded near the time of <i>Scope</i>, back in
    1998, and as Takemura sets out in the liner notes, he had specific goals in mind for this project.
    The particulars are difficult to parse, due in equal measure to my middling grasp of MIDI gear and
    Takemura's only slightly better command of the English language.  From what I gather, Takemura
    programmed a series of melodies and harmonies in MIDI, and then inserted randomness into the equation
    by heavily riding the scrub control when playing back the programmed sequence through a Yamaha MU15
    sound module.</p><p>
    
    Obviously, this is going to be a serious departure for those who hopped on the Takemura Train with
    the cutesy videogame pop of ""Sign."" There are no robot voices here, no Nintendo chord sequences, not
    even a single drum machine hit. Instead, <i>Water's Suite</i> is a dark, dense world of sound where,
    as DC Berman would say, random rules. Though you can tell that the tones on <i>Water's Suite</i> are
    in the same key and bear some relationship to each other, patterns beyond that require some downright
    scientific listening.</p><p>
    
    It's fun to don the lab coat once in a while, though, right?  Here are my findings: ""Part 1"" is
    probably my favorite music here, because it's by far the most focused. Opening with a slow fade up,
    ""Part 1"" is based around a whining drone comprised of an unsteady group of mid-range tones. Behind
    these drawn-out notes is a constantly flickering bed of noise, little clicks and pops that give
    a hint on how all the music thereafter will be constructed. It's an evocative piece of nervous
    atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    When ""Part 2"" comes in, the template suggested in ""Part 1"" is realized: It's an endless cascade of
    notes from a percussive synth patch that sounds a bit like a xylophone. Earlier Takemura reference
    points are <i>Scope</i>'s ""Icefall"" and <i>Funfair</i>'s ""The Cradle of Light"", but this is far less
    musical. From the start of ""Part 2"", the stream of tones is so fast as to remain uncountable.  There
    are probably something like 1/512 notes, thick enough to fill the space completely. Periodically, the
    onslaught takes on another form and a section of feedback replaces it, or else bunches of quick notes
    will cluster into larger patterns. This, my friends, is not an easy listen.</p><p>
<i>Water's Suite</i> is devolutionary music, sounds freed from ordered perfection.  Takemura hints at
    this in the liner notes, where he describes being inspired by the earthquakes in Kyoto: ""The strange
    waves of sound at that moment seem to have a rule, but there is no rule at all."" Takemura's title
    provides another clue as to what's going on: the endless variation of water flowing over rock is
    another apt metaphor.</p><p>
    
    Things are less hectic on ""Part 3"", as the rush of notes slows to a trickle and the opening drones
    make another appearance. Still, any possibility of relaxation is obliterated by sharp, repeating jab
    of a synth note that sounds like a suffering computer saying ""baaap!""  The 22-minute ""Part 5"" is the
    album's 'centerpiece,' I suppose, but it's mostly endless reworkings of ideas expressed earlier.</p><p>
    
    While the notion of constructing a small, detailed ecosystem of sound is interesting enough, the core
    elements of that world have to exert some kind of tug to pull the listener in. All the way through
    <i>Water's Suite</i>, I'm intrigued by the complexity of the album's patterns, but I feel suspended
    on the surface, gazing in from afar instead of feeling immersed. It's an <i>interesting</i> album,
    but sometimes music this abstract still manages to carry emotional weight (I'm thinking here of
    something like <i>Ovalprocess</i>).  <i>Water's Suite</i> is one for the musical physicists only.</p></div>"|7917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7917-waters-suite/|6.4|Mark Richardson

His lyrical priority
    is in developing good battle rhymes to drop on opposing emcees in a freestyle cipher (i.e., ""I don't blame
    you for being wack, I blame your fans for feeling you""), and as such, his subject matter revolves around
    how he's the best, and that a generalized 'you' really, really sucks. While punchline emcees are great when
    can witness the physical manifestation of their verbal jabs onstage, they often fall somewhat flat on
    full-lengths.  Part of this limited appeal can be attributed to the fact that, in a freestyle cipher, the
    joy comes from hearing the emcees' takes on their immediate environment, whether that be an opposing emcee's
    demeanor or dress, or just something that's happening in the audience.  On record, though, punchline emcees
    can't draw the audience in with these references. The better battlers either expand their thematic palette
    or use quirky wordplay to compensate, while the less talented often rely upon offensive cliches and endless
    boasts to draw their audience into the song.  Unfortunately, Copywrite falls into the latter category with
    his debut, <i>The High Exhaulted</i>.</p><p>
    
    A big problem with <i>The High Exhaulted</i> is that there's little lyrical distinction between songs.  Line
    after line, verse after verse, we're bombarded with testimony regarding Copywrite's lyrical skills.  After
    several spins of this disc, the only thing I know about Copywrite is that he's the greatest (because he's
    told us so) and that he really likes to fuck 'bitches.'  He doesn't sprinkle his rhymes with astute social
    observations and his tone is generally more aggressive and insulting than it is humorous.</p><p>
    
    While Copyright does reel off a few lines that entertain in a shocking, out-of-leftfield manner (as when he
    claims that he's ""6'4"" and [will] fuck the shit out of a midget!""), the vast majority of them are adolescent,
    overly misogynistic, and obvious.  Consider this little jewel: ""Fuck swallowing my nut, I make bitches gargle
    my piss.""  This isn't ""The 700 Club"" and I'm not Tipper Gore, so we're not even going to approach that line
    on a moral tip; but, that aside, aren't there better ways to capture your audience's attention than relying
    on these sorry shock tactics?  What about expressing something original about yourself or your surroundings,
    and not repeating the stale platitudes of your machismo rap persona?</p><p>
<i>The High Exhaulted</i>'s production, supplied by the incredibly hot RJD2, The High &amp; Mighty's Mighty
    Mi, and Def Jukie Camu Tao, essentially makes this record a tolerable affair. And it must be said that
    Copywrite does successfully break through his braggadocio veneer briefly on the song ""June"" (previously
    released on RJD2's <i>Dead Ringer</i>).  But it's the only occasion, and even that winds up feeling more
    like a teaser for what should've been.  It's also of interest to note that a good portion of <i>The High
    Exhaulted</i> has been previously released on either singles or compilations, and it generally clicked
    better in that format.  In short spurts, the humor can work; it's just that over the course of an album,
    the subject matter quickly grows redundant, and as Copywrite's boasts pile up without much proof to back
    up his claims, they become meaningless.</p></div>"|1600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1600-the-high-exhaulted/|4.3|Sam Chennault

    soundtracks now/ That's what I wanted to do anyhow."" One could imagine that he was referencing a random
    jetsetter, or perhaps even Randy Newman, who went from making controversial concept albums in the 70s to
    being a Disney schmaltz-slut. Here we are in 2002, though, and Stephin Merritt, Jeff Tweedy, Belle &amp;
    Sebastian, Air, Will Oldham, Badly Drawn Boy, Tom Waits, Public Enemy, Björk, and Yo La Tengo (to name
    just a few) have all done scores for films of varying magnitudes. I had a dry, academic, insightful,
    philosophical theory about this trend-- the kind of gesture that typically earns me great letters from
    our UK readers-- but the Pitchfork bossman says for us to forego the dry, academic, insightful,
    philosophical bent, and keep things short and funny.  So forgive me, my British friends, and hey, who
    farted? (lol)</p><p>
    Now, the ever-ascendant ex-Archers of Loaf and current Crooked Fingers mastermind Eric Bachmann has tried
    his giant elastic hands at soundtracking <i>Ball of Wax</i>, a film in which a talking dog (voiced by Chris
    Tucker) uses the World Wide Web to defeat a gang of sexy homeless vampires. Okay, I haven't seen it. The
    movie's website, which is good enough to link to our recent archived interview with Bachmann (in which he
    expressed a desire to develop more scores), says it's about how ""an evil baseball player turns the game
    into a blood sport by pitting his teammates-- the Carolina Devils-- against one other in violent
    competitions.""  So I was close.</p><p>
    Thing is, Bachmann's already released a tremendous, spooky-soundtrackish album, his 1995 team-up with Ben
    Folds under the name Barry Black. That album's soothing, lasting grumble-and-buzz gets unfairly maligned as
    sounding Latin Playboys-esque and Waits-ish, as if they own the patent on trombones and vibraphones lurching
    across transplanted Eastern European/South American graveyards. Only this album's ""Jimmy the Enforcer"" and
    ""Aspirin and Arsenic"" revisit that mood, but they do so to microwave-gothic winsome effect.</p><p>
    Before I'd heard this CD, I was weighing whether or not to make those weird concessions that reviewers grant
    for these kinds of projects (""give'm a break, this ain't the real thing, it's movie-goop"") when my adopted
    son Svelgph asked, ""Father figure, if takes up as much mass and time as a regular CD, and it costs as much,
    why treat it otherwise?"" <i>Short Careers</i> is coherent enough, though, to survive the test wrought by
    Svelgph's untainted vision. Except for the still-good-but-tone-breaching ""Reach Out and Touch Someone"",
    which gets interestingly dissonant but is inhibited by its role as the ""tense climactic scene"" piece, this
    album is a satisfying suite whose every number expertly juggles two conflicting and complementary themes.</p><p>
    The stilted lilt of ""Good Morning Sleepyhead"" is worth the asking price, a cartoon-triumphant march that
    suggests colossal innocence.  When the track erupts into crowd noise, its significance as a wordless entity
    manifests.  Only the brief ""Nosebleed"" is equally Fingular.  The rest reveals another side of Bachmann,
    replete with ominous pianos and icily melodramatic strings. He never creeps into Corky Elfman territory,
    and he keeps the proceedings from getting too chambery by layering everything with those repetitive digital
    undercurrents he's been toying with since 1996's <i>All the Nation's Airports</i>-- occasionally even
    seasoning the mix with some industrial turbulence or echoing valves.</p><p>
    But while Bachmann's compositions never evoke a climate of first-day-with-the-new-cellist, they aren't as
    blazingly original as his work elsewhere. ""The Mysterious Death of Robert Tower"" comes close to lifting a
    line from a famous piece of classical music that my high-cultureless self only knows from a jewelry
    commercial.  The pregnant, plaintive plucking of ""Finding the Wholes Filling the Gaps"" is reminiscent of
    Angelo Badalamenti's self-consciously downhome soundtrack for <i>The Straight Story</i>.  The pained,
    galvanic mainline of the score, which undergoes several revisitations after one first hears it on ""A Diamond
    Is the Devil's Eye"", cannot help but summon Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet's actuating, tragic accompaniment
    to <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>.</p><p>
    By the luscious, balmy, slothfully sweeping closer ""Ty Cobb,"" however, you won't have a care in the world
    except for how this record exacts sweet vengeance on the extracurricular junior-high band experiments
    committed to tape by Rachel's. Like so many instrumental efforts, this burnished opus is excellent for
    studying, bundling, and watering the cacti.  I can't wait to see what Múm whip up for <i>American Dink</i>,
    that new Adam Sandler movie about the horny misfit jock.</p></div>"|517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/517-short-careers-original-score-for-the-film-ball-of-wax/|7.6|William Bowers

We need to have a talk, a serious talk about the evils of Country Western music.  Don't
    give me that innocent look; I found this Neko Case CD in your room, and I know, you're probably thinking,
    'But, dad!  Neko doesn't even play country!'  True enough, but this is how it always starts.  There's
    trouble in Ms Case's witchy, alt-country siren-song, mark my words.  Boy, I've seen the best minds of
    my generation lost to Garth Brooks and midget rodeos, and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let it happen to

    A few years later, I'm listening to Neko's third full-length, <i>Blacklisted</i>, and I finally understand
    what my dad was worried about.  I'm not about to run out and buy Alan Jackson's back catalog or anything--
    a healthy dislike of Kentucky Fried Music has been bred into me.  But even to my yankee sensibilities,
    the subtle influence of the old South on this album is charming, even beautiful.  Beneath its jangle and
    melancholy, a faint country soul gently simmers, occasionally bubbling to the surface.  Maybe it's just the
    barest hint of a Southern drawl in the Virginia-born Case's dusky, breathless vocals (the accent is still
    detectable though she was raised primarily in Tacoma, WA), or the twangy banjo and steel pedal melodies,
    but it's in there, and goddamnit, I just can't resist.</p><p>
    
    Tensely picked banjo and twelve-string guitar open ""Things That Scare Me"" with that timeless trademark of
    the most haunting western balladry: the sinister vibe of imminent danger, a distant peal of thunder before
    the sky falls.  But the foreboding here is merely a ruse-- nothing comes but the slow, sad rain of ""Deep
    Red Bells"", whose backing ""ooh's"" and echoes of steel lend an air of deep longing.  This song's clouds part
    briefly in a moment of silence when Neko plaintively intones, ""Where does this mean world cast its cold
    eye?/ Who's left to suffer long about you?""  Later, the refrain is followed by a sparkling bridge like a
    glimpse of sun before the rain returns.</p><p>
    
    With instrumental assistance from notables like Giant Sand's Howe Gelb and his Calexico counterparts Joey
    Burns and John Convertino-- as well as Chicago alt-country crooner Kelly Hogan and Canadian singer/songwriter
    Mary Margaret O'Hara on backing vocals-- <i>Blacklisted</i>'s accompaniment is roundly excellent and
    evocative, but Case's voice is what really sells the record.  Her opaque wail is more confident here than
    ever, topping even her sturdy melodic blasts on the New Pornographers' now-legendary ""Letter from an Occupant.""
    But where she simply belted that tune out to gloriously compliment the band's snapping power-pop, her
    performance on <i>Blacklisted</i> is dense with emotional heft and more richly expressive.  Her rendition of
    Aretha Franklin's ""Runnin' Out of Fools""-- reworked ever so slightly to match the tone of this record, yet
    remaining largely faithful to the original-- is the best evidence of this, conveying ecstasy and loss with
    an elastic buoyancy so full of eloquent depth that you feel as though it could swallow you whole and spit
    you out on another plane entirely.</p><p>
    
    I've stayed off the C&amp;W; ever since my pop had that little talk at me, but when its influence is employed as
    beautifully and flawlessly as it is on <i>Blacklisted</i>, it makes me wonder what other experiences could
    be lying in wait for me.  <i>Blacklisted</i> is gorgeous heartache, my soul be damned-- and ""Folsom Prison
    Blues"" ain't too shabby, either.  Dad, if you're reading this, I know that you listened to my copy of <i>The
    Virginian</i> even after you warned me about its gateway effects; I saw you.  So if you see me a few years
    down the line in a rusted-out pickup with a bumper sticker that screams ""Never Forget!"" in neon reds and
    blues, and you want to know who taught me how to really fall for this C&amp;W; stuff... it was you, alright?  I
    learned it by watching you.</p></div>"|1323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1323-blacklisted/|7.9|Eric Carr

    upon the street majesterically, parking violations stickered to the canopy and Chains himself whippin' them
    lectro-steeds.  Pulled up to the drive, sed somethin about somethin about STRAIGHT FROM YA RADIO SOMETHIN
    BEATS SOMETHIN SOMETHIN GOLD CHAINS SOMETHIN SOMETHIN BLOWIN OUT THE STREETS MUSIQUE CONCRETE MCs AT MY FEET
    SOMETHIN ALL AROUND ME SOMETHIN WHAT IS ONE TO DO!</p><p>
    He really said some of that!  And then, whap, horses runnin, people scared.  Gold Chains and carriage
    banished from even peripheral sight.  A disc materializing within the sweated palms of my hairy hands.
    Flames up the street, license plate spinnin.  I ran to the Sony CDP-CE525, yelled something at it, then
    gently, calmly, rationally fed it the compact.</p><p>
    And then, from this dream I awoke me-- to the sound of my bedside alarm.  I have tuned it, just so,
    between the local Lite-FM and New Countries, lest I be soothed back into Tigerbeat dreams by an
    experimenting college DJ.  I remember only moments of this vision, something involving a lost soccer
    shoe and a vegetable garden.  But I wake with ""Straight From Your Radio"" bounding all up and around
    the skull, a song whose wicked wonderment I have experienced but a singular once.  I put my fingers
    to my temples, begin shaking intensely, my nose bleeds, and a disc materializes within the sweated
    palms of my hairy hands.</p><p>
    No one knows Gold Chains is a white guy cause he sounds like Ja Rule.  Ja Rule, though, see, he's very
    sensitive to the needs of the ladies.  You don't get that with Gold Chains.  You get: ""Get dat cootchie
    over here I want to fuck it aww yeah, get dat cootchie lookin tight I want to lick it all night.""  To
    which a fine, upstanding citizen such as myself can only respond: ""<i>WHOA!</i>  GOLD CHAINS!""  But that's
    his whole thing.  And then the bass enters, throbbing like bursting genitals, a kickdrum as sturdy as any
    kickdrum these ears of mine could hope a kickdrum might be, an electronic ascending zwwwooop, the tch'ing
    hi-hats.  And over this megadecibal dubby madness a sudden rhyme: ""I treat ya cootchie like a maze, com,
    plex, turn ya page,"" as though Rudy Ray Moore perchanced to freestyle a moment upon Chicago's dance beat,
    B96.</p><p>
    Urban contemporary chart-attack: the Tigerbeat krew loves this sound, as exhibit #A (the Kid606 <i>Action
    Packed Mentallist</i> CD) and exhibit #B (the Knifehandchop EP with remix'd DMX) vividly display.  Is there
    great shame in this?  Some indie sockheads would say that indeed the krew is young and has been fed the
    demonseed by evil Dr. Clear Channel and His Two-Or-Three-Song Orchestra.  Select indier-than-thou characters,
    I am coming to accept, are just too freegin uptight.  I had a revelation last fall, see, and it was called
    ""What About Us"" and it sounded like Massive Attack doin' anal with Björk.  SOLD!  A stream of revelations,
    a whole fuckin' John 3:16 of 'em: ""We Need a Resolution,"" ""Jumpin, Jumpin,"" ""What's Your Fantasy,"" <i>""Who
    We Be,"" ""Break Ya Neck,"" <b>""Shake Ya Ass,"" ""No More Drama,"" even Mya-- </b></i><i>Mya</i>-- singing  ""Case of the
    Ex,"" baby, I fess!</p><p>
    That's why I respect Gold Chains and Tigerbeat alike.  The indie rock, bless its heart, it's my little
    sweet pumpkin and I kiss it all the time and bring it candies.  But god<i>damn</i> there's somethin so
    so fine 'bout them gritty-azz beats detonating crunkly out the Eskyalade.  Tigerbeat's like old rock n'
    roll without the surfing.  It desires only fun, enjoyment, thrills and automobills.  Fed through the
    intestines of triplesex urban pop and elitist electronica, thugged out for pretend, ironic <i>and</i>
    beautifully sincere.  A Hallmark to Miss E, cc'd to Squarepusher and sealed with Kraftwerk stickers.</p><p>
    Gold Chains, smooth as the silken dollar, plays the striking cobra to Peaches' nubile cameltoe, and when
    he's not talking explicitly about dick action, which is just about never, he's going off about them
    ""mountains of coke up in the V.I.P."" and cheek-tonguing an Eric B bit about his superior mic skills.
    <i>Straight From Your Radio</i>, though: limited replay value.  I like it cause it does not judge me, but
    other Tigerbeat lovers play me better and don't make me think about Ja.  But Chains is good.  He's good
    for one night.  Honey that's all you need.</p></div>"|3497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3497-straight-from-your-radio-ep/|7.2|Ryan Schreiber

    she quickly became dissatisfied with the label's treatment of her records, and soon decided to buy back
    the tapes for her third full-length, <i>Bachelor No. 2</i>, and put it out herself.  Just another long-haul
    pop talent that the majors have signed and then foolishly refused to make time for.  So we can all root for
    her success story: she managed to move 200,000 copies of <i>Bachelor No. 2</i> by herself, and now has a
    second album-- her fourth overall-- on her own label.</p><p>
    
    The story of her business life is worth retelling because it's so close to the themes of her songwriting:
    she hits bad times, but never mires herself in them.  And it's easy to see why P.T. Anderson wrote his film
    <i>Magnolia</i> loosely around her songs: she understands the people who struggle through their work and
    love lives on the fringes of show business.  As an industry veteran she seems to have learned to turn the
    highs and lows into a day-to-day routine, and in that spirit, she's learned to explore the most depressing
    themes while transcending the self-pity so associated with lovesick laments.</p><p>
<i>Lost in Space</i> is the first album Mann has made solely under her own guidance and for her own label.
    And as with all her work, the craftsmanship is impeccable-- three- or four-minute pop songs with arching,
    lilting melodies, and arrangements where every detail is in place, from the succinct but grinding guitar
    solos, to the subtle keyboards and embellishments that back her up.  And then there's the centerpiece:
    the rich tone of her subtly expressive vocals, a voice that's so even and melodic that the slightest crack
    speaks volumes.  Her hooks grow subtler with every album, and though it can take a couple listens for some
    of her better tunes to catch hold here, her ballads have only become more striking: ""This Is How It Goes""
    and ""Invisible Ink"", both opening with just Mann and her acoustic before swelling into orchestration,
    may be her most heartbreaking yet.</p><p>
    
    More so than with her previous albums, every song on <i>Lost in Space</i> sticks to the themes of need,
    strife and desire, filtering them through her own relationships and career while maintaining a narrative
    loose enough to apply to the listener's own experiences.  Mann excels at writing lyrics that use specific
    imagery but carry general meanings.  She talks about ambition (""The moth don't care when he sees the flame/
    He might get burned, but he's in the game""), and the aching chorus of ""This Is How It Goes"" outlines a story
    while remaining unlimited by precise details: ""It's all about drugs, it's all about shame/ And whatever they
    want, don't tell them your name.""  Sure, this is all far from chipper, without even one bright or hypercatchy
    song to mix things up, but the consistency, for the most part, is tight enough to warrant it.</p><p>
    
    For the most part.  While <i>Bachelor No. 2</i> felt more disparate and less powerful, the tracklist was
    varied and inventive.  <i>Lost in Space</i> leaves you feeling that she's already covered this terrain--
    even played variations of some of these songs.  I find myself liking the sum more than its parts.  But
    it's hard to fault Mann for repeating a formula that works this well, or for making a record this focused.
    Her fans will certainly adore it regardless, though if you're new to her work, <i>Bachelor No. 2</i> may be
    a better place to start.</p></div>"|5083.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5083-lost-in-space/|7.6|Chris Dahlen

Call it the George Harrison
    Rule, as the Quiet Beatle perfectly represents what I'm talking about: a couple songs per album,
    contributions more instrumental than vocal, rare appearances in the publicity circus.  Every era's got
    'em, from John Entwistle to Richard Manuel to Mick Jones to Lee Ranaldo to Tobin Sprout.  As a properly
    quiet and shy indie rock guy, I can't help but have a soft spot for such shadowmen, who never seem to get
    the credit they deserve until they're gone or, in the case of the first two, found dead in hotel rooms.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately for Jason Loewenstein, the Harrison Rule does not automatically apply.  In fact, I stopped
    caring about Sebadoh right about the time Loewenstein started contributing close to the same number of
    songs as uneasy frontman Lou Barlow.  Perhaps Barlow all too easily remembered his power struggles with
    J Mascis back in those sepia-toned Dinosaur Jr days, and compensated by allowing his own dictatorship to
    slide into editor-less democracy.  Whatever the behind-the-scenes situation, when the hushed beauty of
    choice Barlow melancho-llege rock tracks like ""Beauty of the Ride"" were lost in juxtaposition to
    Loewenstein's sack of power chords and ""whoooaaaa baby I'm not a MIND readahhh!"" bellow, I lost interest.</p><p>
    
    Now that Sebadoh seems to be retired and nearly eligible for a bronze bust in the Indie Hall of Fame,
    Loewenstein's taken his latest batch of mood-breakers and collected them for a debut solo album.  Sorry
    to say, <i>At Sixes and Sevens</i> shows little-to-no evolution from his makeout-session-ruining songs
    on <i>Harmacy</i>.  While the record might have had some throwback potential (seeing as Loewenstein has
    yet to move on from Seattle circa 1993), the contents are nowhere near quality enough to kick off that
    grunge revival we'll all know is right around the corner when ""That 90's Show"" premieres on Fox.</p><p>
    
    Loewenstein's problems seem to spring from a penchant for textbook hard rock and an almost astonishing lack
    of range, failings that are amplified by his choice to record all of <i>At Sixes and Sevens</i>'
    instrumentation himself.  Track one, ""Codes"", is reasonable enough with its thick guitar chug, canter
    speed, and what might be the obligatory kiss-off lyrics, but after ten more variations on the same theme,
    even a brisk forty-minute album starts to drag.  For a time-killer, you might internally debate which is
    more unremarkable: Loewenstein's double-tracked flannel shirt vocals or his close-to-uniformly forgettable
    melodies (""Circles"" being the sole exception).</p><p>
    
    The rare deviation does indicate much growth potential, as the less distortion-pedal reliant ""I'm a Shit""
    (hey there, Tad, where you been?) and ""More Drugs"" come off as Acme-brand imitation Barlow.  Meanwhile,
    the instrumental ""H/M"" is just about as pointless as <i>Harmacy</i>'s ""Hillbilly II"", and the hyper-Latin
    of track six made me scrawl ""sounds like drunk Santana"" in my mental notebook before finding out the track
    <i>really was called</i> ""Crazy Santana.""  Could've been a <i>Signs</i>-like holy phenomenon, of course,
    but I'm more inclined to think it was creative laziness.  Or creative limitations.  Either way, <i>At
    Sixes and Sevens</i> makes the case that Loewenstein is best suited to a role as a sideman-- the completely
    silent kind.</p></div>"|4828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4828-at-sixes-and-sevens/|4.2|Rob Mitchum

    Oi! Sasha, mate. Yeah, you. Hey, look at me when I'm yellin' at you! Listen here-- I'm what your
    sodding marketing exec calls a 'target demographic,' and you have taken a large unforgivable shit
    on me, you bastard.</p><p>
    
    Who? Me? You got the wrong geezer, mate. My name's Alexander Coe.</p><p>
    
    Don't give me that, you weasel! You're Sasha, one half of dynamic DJ duo, Sasha and Digweed, club
    scene stalwart and hocker of over twelve mix CDs. And don't fake me that you're that German pop
    sensation Sasha Alexander. I got your number, mate, and I also got your debut album, <i>Airdrawndagger</i>.</p><p>
    
    Erm, thanks. What do you think of it?</p><p>
    
    Well, that's the reason I'm yelling at you, you plonker!  I remember your early days, when you released
    the don't-call-it-an-album-nor-an-EP <i>The Qat Collection</i>. I remember when your style of club wax
    was termed 'epic house.' I dug your highfalutin' 13+ minute tracks. But me and thousands of my 'demo'
    have been waiting nearly ten years for your full-length debut.</p><p>
    
    I've been busy, you know. I did save NYC's Twilo club from ketamine meltdown and hung out with me mate
    Digweed at Bedrock.</p><p>
    
    Shut it, Sashmate. If you really expected people to enjoy this record, you're loonier than you look.
    It's as wet as a Welsh spring morning!  I bet this disc's feistier moments only came about because
    that Junkie XL bloke you persuaded to join you spiked your Horlicks with a dash of Red Bull.</p><p>
    
    Actually, I was going for a more chill-out vibe. I want my audience to distinguish between Sasha the
    Megastar DJ and Sasha the Artist.</p><p>
    
    Pish! Even if I bought into that BS, no one could seriously consider the tediously safe <i>Airdrawndagger</i>
    the work of an artist. Pull the one, mate, it's got bells on it. Or am I missing something? Like a
    Phazon soundsystem?  Yeh, my home stereo can't provide the right sonic spectrum for which this
    'masterpiece' was created, eh?  Arse!</p><p>
    
    What do you mean?! What's wrong with an album I spent ten years creating?</p><p>
    
    For one thing, mi ol' china, what fucking took you so long? Where're the goodies for all that effort?
    Far as I can tell, you ripped off some of Pete Namlook's ambient noodling, tealeafed a few stale breaks
    and spent three months on hold with the ProTools helpdesk. How else can you explain ever-so-atmospheric
    cobblers of ""Mr. Tiddles"" or ""Magnetic North"", your blatant rip-off of Future Sound of London's ""Papua
    New Guinea""? And what's with sampling King Crimson for ""Cloud Cuckoo""?  Surely you of all people, with
    bankvaults of dosh, could afford to hire Robert Fripp to kick out a jam or two. Cheap bastard.</p><p>
    
    Well, at least I didn't pull an Oakenfold and, like, invite an errant member of Collective Soul to make
    a guest appearance! Or that Nelly Retardo chick. Give me some credit for keeping creeps like that out
    of the picture.</p><p>
    
    Yeah, cheers. But then you went and followed Orbital down the toilet!  UK dance pioneers or not, sounds
    like they've exhausted the juice in their glowsticks and retreated to briar pipes and slippers.</p><p>
    
    I don't like the level this conversation has descended to.</p><p>
    
    Now you know how I bloody feel. Are we going to have to wait another ten years for you to crawl back

    surrounding her flacid debut, <i>Afterglow</i>.  <i>Afterglow</i>, you might recall, collapsed because
    Allison played by record exec rules; she was Dido, albeit with more than just a simper to call 'talent.'
    Fortunately, the largely successful <i>We Are Science</i> shows Allison as a far more secure vocalist
    and, more importantly, more confident of her experimental inclinations.</p><p>
    
    Allison was once one-third of One Dove, the Andrew Weatherall-produced band who were all set to out-bliss
    Primal Scream's <i>Screamdelica</i>. One Dove's only full-length, <i>Morning Dove White</i>, combined
    Balearic chill with Neil Young folkiness and arcing feedback. Toned down by the good MBA chaps at FFRR,
    the publicly released version of <i>Morning Dove White</i> was an emaciated shred of what One Dove and
    Weatherall originally handed over.  Nice.</p><p>
    
    The hands-off heads at Mantra Recordings, however, as well as her collaborations with Death in Vegas (""Dirge,""
    from <i>The Contino Sessions</i>) and Glaswegian pure-techno addicts Slam (""Visions,"" from <i>Alien Radio</i>)
    have bolstered Allison's self-assuredness.  She's also shown more than just loyalty by asking the <i>other</i>
    half of Two Lone Swordsmen, Keith ""Radioactive Man"" Tenniswood, to mix, program and co-produce half of this
    album.  And though former influence Weatherall is physically absent from duties here, his amalgam of electro and
    headspace dub is ubiquitous.</p><p>
<i>We Are Science</i> begins with the crunchy electro of ""We're Only Science"" which sounds exactly as you'd
    imagine an Allison/Tenniswood collaboration.  Tenniswood opens the front door and in lurches the greebo-ist
    of basslines-- one that lives alone in a trash-strewn trailer, who never changes his leather pants, has
    breath that peels paint, and the social skills of a snakehead fish.  Allison's response is simply to repeat
    the title.  But rather than the blank delivery of Miss Kitten or Adult.'s Nicola Kuperus, Allison's delivery
    has more of a Sheila Chandra inflection. The song's countermelody also supports the Chandra comparison, as
    it's remarkably close to the melody of Monsoon's ""Ever So Lonely.""</p><p>
    
    ""Substance"" scores by integrating electroclash elements (stabbing squiggles, chugging analog bass) with
    nu-breaks feistiness. The swirling Farfisa-ish organ line and straight-ahead rhythms of ""You Can Be Replaced""
    connect the song with the druggier moments of <i>Afterglow</i>. Yet Allison's vocals are far less fey here--
    she never goes so far as to attempt a Morissette level of ersatz earnestness.  Rising from a slow burst of
    deep bass bubbles (a very Weatherall technique), ""Performance"" marks the lone appearance of one of IDM's
    forgotten masters, Beaumont Hannett. Using similar production techniques as the ones he employed for Lida
    Husik, Hannett surrounds Allison in a transcendental layer of strings and analogue confections. It's the
    brooding production that William Orbit has longed to master. Allison, of course, knows that nothing should
    distract from Hannant's production. She relegates her vocals to a few brief interludes during these stunning,
    celestial seven minutes.</p><p>
    
    Coming on a like a female-fronted Lo-Fidelity Allstars, ""Strung Out"" is the first of two tracks recorded
    with Mercury Rev's Dave Fridmann and Grasshopper.  The song is classic radio-pop, albeit tempered by gruff
    distortion and enhanced with Tenniswood's silver box trickery.  And ""Lover,"" the closing track and second
    of the Fridmann/Grasshopper productions, is the best of the bunch.  Though floating along on the stylistic
    tropes of country (slide guitar, languid drawling vocals), it reminds me more of the machine euphoria of
    Underworld's pinnacle moment, ""Rez.""  The push/pull of these two styles affords the song a potency it
    would surely lack if either constituent were absent.</p><p>
    
    The only real misfire on <i>Afterglow</i> comes with ""I Think I Love You,"" a song only the most damnably
    loyal Fischerspooner aficionado could love.  Over a generic electroclash rhythm, Allison repeats the title
    with less conviction than the average hormonally imbalanced twelfth-grader recites the Pledge of Allegiance.
    Perhaps our Dot will say anything to secure a quickie in the bogs.</p><p>
    
    After the limp meandering of <i>Afterglow</i>, <i>We Are Science</i> is unquestionably a leap in the right
    direction.  ""Lover,"" ""Substance,"" and ""Performance,"" in particular, prove that the right co-producer at the
    controls can achieve spectacular feats.  Yet for all this record's strengths, I'm not fully convinced it's
    the one to crown her career.  All the elements are present, sure, but not always in the right place.</p></div>"|119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/119-we-are-science/|7.7|Paul Cooper

    have finally been given their due. Those of us lucky enough to have been
    fans of the band during their too-brief, five-year lifespan know all too
    well how they never quite got the respect they deserved. Sure, local and
    national rags praised these caustic Boston geeks from the day they first
    arrived on the scene, but the Pixies' profound, lasting impact on both
    underground and popular rock music would take years to truly register.</p><p>
    
    But this is, after all, how these things often go; true greatness is
    usually recognized after the fact, if only because it takes time for the
    ripple of influence to reach shore.  Kurt Cobain brought some attention
    to the band's radiating importance by quipping, in his typical self-deprecating
    fashion, that ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" was a Pixies ripoff.  It was, in fact,
    an <i>homage</i>.  But even then, at the height of
    the 'alternative' boom, the Pixies were only considered very good or great;
    not recognized, as they are today, as one of the best American rock bands
    ever.</p><p>
    
    So it pains me to give this album anything less than a 10.  As one might
    expect, the nine tracks on this 18-minute album are outstanding, though
    most of them carry an asterisk.  So let's backtrack.  In March 1987, after
    forming several months earlier, the Pixies recorded a 17-song demo cassette
    at Boston's hallowed Fort Apache studios that came to be known as ""The
    Purple Tape."" The cassette attracted the attention of many, including
    Ivo Watts-Russell, head of England's influential 4AD label, who issued
    eight of the demos as the band's debut EP, <i>Come on Pilgrim</i>.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps I'm biased, having heard that EP long before the demos here, but
    for the most part, he chose the right songs for <i>Pilgrim</i>. This
    isn't to say the tracks here are worse, but later in their career the
    band recorded better versions of most of them. Consider the opener here,
    ""Broken Face.""  Once you've heard the version on 1988's <i>Surfer Rosa</i>,
    the full-length debut recorded by Steve Albini, there's no going back.
    The demo is much tamer all around, and it doesn't have that breathless
    cut in Black Francis' opening line, where the end of the word 'face' is
    lopped off, and he screeches again, ""I got a...""</p><p>
    
    Similarly, ""Break My Body,"" just doesn't have quite the edge it has on
    <i>Surfer Rosa</i>, though they're practically the same note-for-note.
    And the same could be said for ""I'm Amazed"" if not for one critical
    difference from its <i>Rosa</i> version-- an odd, euphonious bridge that
    recalls later 4AD-ers His Name Is Alive. Some might call this bridge a
    nice breather, but, like a speed bump in the Daytona 500, it kills the
    track's scorching momentum.</p><p>
    
    A cover of Peter Ivers' ""In Heaven (Lady in the Radiator Song)""-- listed
    here simply as ""In Heaven""-- is also disposable, as the band's live version
    on the ""Gigantic"" single and the <i>Complete 'B' Sides</i> compilation has
    more raw emotion-- which, to be blunt, just means that Francis' screams at
    the end of the song sound better.  ""Down to the Well,"" meanwhile, would be
    more compelling than its slicker cousin on 1990's surf-rock-inspired
    <i>Bossanova</i> if not for Francis' screaming on the version found here,
    an irritating dog howl.</p><p>
    
    But there are some positives.  For those of you who were always turned
    off by the bouncy pop of the ""Here Comes Your Man"" heard on 1989's
    <i>Doolittle</i>, the version on <i>Pixies</i> is like sugar-free gum-- in
    a good way.  Also, the original incarnation of ""Build High"" is without the
    slight irritation that mars its successor, which ended up as a b-side for
    1991's <i>Trompe le Monde</i> (and appears on the aforementioned compilation).
    The demo cut of ""Subbacultcha"" is also preferable to the <i>Trompe le Monde</i>
    version, as it contains a part musically similar to ""Distance Equals Rate
    Times Time"" that befits the song's ambling, storytelling technique.</p><p>
    
    Most of you-- those who aren't completists, that is-- should ignore everything
    I've just written.  Because all you really care about is the one track that
    hasn't been officially released until now: ""Rock A My Soul."" Is it worth buying
    the whole album for?  Sorry, no.  It is, however, a stellar track with a chorus
    in which Francis' titular plea is punctuated on drums and guitar by brutish
    stop-and-starts. It would have fit in perfectly on <i>Pilgrim</i> or <i>Rosa</i>.</p><p>
    
    It is truly amazing that these songs were the first the band ever laid to
    tape. Removed from any context-- namely, the later re-recordings of most of
    these tunes-- they're better than most anything released this year. But
    these demos were born 15 years ago, and then were essentially locked in the
    basement for years.  Now, freed of any restraints, they can't just enter
    daylight, show up on peoples' doorsteps and expect to be loved.</p></div>"|6314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6314-pixies/|6.4|Ryan Kearney

Hip-hop is a world phenomenon now!  Yes, spend some time poking around your favorite
    music magazine's website and I'm sure you'll find a heavy handful of hip-hop-gone-global thinkpieces.
    Read profiles of angstful teenagers rapping about life in Israeli-occupied Palestine, Cuban kids protesting
    the oppressive state police in rhyme, even Greenland b-boys composing bouncy anthems about caribou and snow.</p><p>
    
    So it should come as no surprise that the British, notorious for chewing on our music before spitting it
    back over the Atlantic in a shiny, new form, have also turned their sun-starved faces to the arena of
    hip-hop.  There's just one small problem: simply put, British accents just don't sound particularly right
    in the context of syncopated rap-speech.  To put my tweed linguistics jacket on, the American tendency to
    cheat on pronunciation fits in perfectly with the wordplay of hip-hop, while the stubborn British habit of
    perfectly enunciating every syllable makes things sound rather, well, formal.  Or to put my Degrassi Jr.
    High pop culture jacket on, British rap can't help sounding like the dope flow of the immortal Murray
    Head on ""One Night in Bangkok.""</p><p>
    
    Which is why the first time you put on <i>Original Pirate Material</i>, you might find it awfully hysterical--
    especially if the name had you assuming it was going to be another Strokesian garage act.  The giggles will
    eventually give way to a bit of discomfort at the slightly awkward delivery-- the words here are jammed into
    measures like an overstuffed couch.  You'll wince at a chorus like, ""Geezers need excitement/ If their lives
    don't provide it, then they incite violence/ Common sense, simple common sense,"" bursting at the seams of
    its tempo.  Then, about 48 hours later, you'll realize it still hasn't left your head.</p><p>
    
    One-man MC/DJ package Mike Skinner has an obvious talent for forging damn sharp hip-pop hooks that supercede
    his inherent verbal handicap.  Unashamedly revealing a taste for 80s soft rock, the smooth-sung chorus and
    reverbed Rhodes of ""Has It Come to This"" is highly reminiscent of fantastically hair-styled pop giants Hall
    &amp; Oates-- and believe it or not, I don't mean that as a putdown.  ""It's Too Late,"" meanwhile, features a
    sugared melancholy duet with a dreamy British lass between the verses, and tracks fortified with more canned
    orchestra than a late-period Flaming Lips album.</p><p>
    
    All of which would leave things a bit flaky, if it wasn't for Skinner's flair for nervous, metallic beats
    (The Streets' percussion is inventive enough for the album to be erroneously labeled as 'electronica' in the
    critic's bible <i>All Music Guide</i>).  Whether changing speeds or dropping out unexpectedly beneath the
    ominous strings of ""Same Old Thing,"" trampolining playfully in ""Don't Mug Yourself,"" or rolling along
    completely oblivious to the piano loop rhythm on ""Weak Become Heroes,"" they're catchy and inventive
    enough to make one forget the accent for a bit.  It's not all successful (the slow-reggae bounce of ""Let's
    Push Things Forward"" is, ironically, pretty backward and tired), but it usually is-- and even when it's not,
    it's at least trying to be.</p><p>
    
    Which leaves us with the lyrics, tales of English street life provided entirely by the very proper-sounding
    Skinner.  Now, if the phrase ""English street life"" makes you bristle, hold on a sec-- anyone who's ever read
    an Irvine Welsh novel (half-credit if you've seen <i>Trainspotting</i>) should know that life for the British
    working class is hardly Buckingham Palace.  So while the lingo takes some getting used to ('geezas' instead
    of 'niggaz,' 'birds' not 'bitches,' etc.), it'd be incorrect to write off The Streets as either poseur or
    gimmick, and in a genre where unique lyrical perspective is especially important, the UK vibe is an
    intriguing element.</p><p>
    
    Plus, let's face it, Skinner's race and nationality will probably earn The Streets a spot on the ""safe
    hip-hop for indie rockers list"" this year, possessing, as it does, that certain unplaceable, familiar
    aura that appeals to mild hip-hop-ophobes such as, well, myself.  As such, I'm not real sure where it would
    fall along the critical spectrum according to a genre expert (paging Sam Chennault, Sam Chennault to the OR,
    please), but <i>Original Pirate Material</i> seems to be remarkably solid.  And given the fact that it does,
    eventually, manage to overcome the horrific-sounding concept of British hip-hop, it seems pretty reasonable
    to give it a recommendation.  Bloody good show, I say.</p></div>"|7531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7531-original-pirate-material/|7.9|Rob Mitchum

I'm not really sure what
    kind of sound it would make, or if it would make any sound at all.  Hence
    my confusion and amusement at this band's name.  In musical notation, 'arco'
    means 'played with the bow,' as in a violin, bass, viola or cello (or maybe
    a guitar for you adventurous types).  I'm sure it's just meant to be a joke
    on the band's part-- for one thing, there aren't any flutes within 500 miles
    of this recording-- even if the music they make isn't all that endowed
    with humor.</p><p>
    
    I mean, just check out that album title: <i>Everything After the Bomb is
    Sci-Fi</i>.  Heavy.  Wait, let me rephrase that: heavy?  And the music isn't
    much of a picnic, either, as it resides mostly in a chaotic, formless realm
    where indiscriminate noise is monarch.  That said, the music also isn't nearly
    as apocalyptic as the album title might suggest-- instead, it finds a sort of
    middle ground between cold distance and actual emotion that, while never
    particularly upbeat, abstains from becoming all that dark or foreboding.</p><p>
    
    Three Foundation members also spend time post-rockin' with fellow Pittsburgh
    crew Meisha, and the Foundation are at their best when the music veers closer
    to the more controlled, structured approach of that band.  Most of opener
    ""The Myth That Became Jimmy Palm"" sets churning guitars to a persistent rhythm
    that rises and falls before succumbing to some overlong electronic entropy,
    and the overall results are fairly satisfying.  The contour of the song from
    order to disorder isn't exactly revolutionary, but the change is gradual
    enough not to be obvious on the first couple of listens.</p><p>
    
    ""The Mean Egyptian"" is the best track of the seven present, heating from a
    basic repeated guitar phrase and simple rhythms to a boil of crashing
    cymbals and slowly morphing melodic guitar motifs.  Not coincidentally, this
    track is also one of the shortest, veering abruptly out of its groove and
    leaving only a glowing trail of guitar and keyboard noise behind to form the
    basis for the opening of ""Captain World's Apprentice.""</p><p>
    
    Now, to be perfectly honest, not much of interest goes down in the middle of
    this album.  Captain World's apprentice seems to have forgotten his training,
    giving up the ethereal drones he came in with for formless, aimless static
    that drags on for several minutes before being overtaken by a series of
    buzzing drones that proceed nowhere.  ""It's a Symbol Like the Word 'And'""
    follows with some swelling, seemingly malfunctioning synth that <i>seems</i>
    interesting at first, but quickly loses its appeal-- as the clock ticks ever
    onward, the synth remains stubbornly stagnant.  Static and a bit of noodly
    guitar caught in a loop occupy the track's midsection, while a subdued drum
    groove provides a bit of lift at the end for the sliding, heavily delayed
    guitar sounds moving overhead.</p><p>
    
    ""The Bastard Son of the Earthquake Choir"" opens with some striking guitar
    harmonics, but eventually caves to the band's overused tactic of giving noise
    a beat and letting it ride for too long.  The dirty guitar riff and charging
    drums that open ""The Lizard Christ"" are initially fairly clear, but the track
    loses its shape somewhat as it progresses, due largely to a lack of any kind
    of real melody to give it contour.  The Foundation then dumps you into the
    closer, ""Seymour Uncle Billy,"" which offers freeform percussion played under
    a constant, unchanging drone.  The piece really only takes shape when the
    percussion congeals into a rhythm, pounding the drone along, and offering the
    disc's most intense moment-- unfortunately, this only lasts for about one-fourth
    of the nearly ten minute song.</p><p>
<i>Everything After the Bomb Is Sci-Fi</i> does has its moments of sonic interest,
    poking up out of a stew of sound.  But those who come expecting strong compositions
    or something viscerally gripping will likely be left at a loss when the disc stops
    spinning.  The ingredients for something good are certainly there, but the Arco
    Flute Foundation needs to focus more compositionally and strive for a more palpable
    mood before I can truly recommend them.</p></div>"|280.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/280-everything-after-the-bomb-is-sci-fi/|5.9|Joe Tangari

They've been slinging their backwoods punk cowboy
    music more-or-less steadily for over two decades.  Sure, their last record, <i>Journey to the End of the
    Night</i>, sounded a little mellow, like they were growing resigned to their age-- from its slow tunes and
    gloomy title, you'd think they were picking which belongings to take with them to the nursing home, and
    getting ready to put the cat to sleep.  But suddenly, here they are with an anniversary record that, while
    not quite as wild as the ones they made in their prime, sounds raucous and brutally alive.</p><p>
    
    Recorded in their adopted home of Chicago, the ill-titled <i>OOOH!</i> is a return to textbook Mekons-- from
    gracefully shambling country to deep-beating tribal rhythms, by way of good, clean rock 'n roll.  Susie
    Honeymoon's fiddle whistles and squeaks as she opens the album; Jon Langford and Tom Greenhalgh share
    roadhouse guitars, and Steve Goulding's drums crack the floorboards.  And it's full of detail: the birdlike
    vocal harmonies fluttering over the end of ""Take His Name in Vain""; the thick moans of ""I am a stonehead""
    that open the last track; the squirrely guitars and violin on ""Bob Hope &amp; Charity,"" and Sally Timm's strange
    narratives and poetry.</p><p>
    
    Singing lead are Langford, vocal cords still sounding like twisted roots on a stunted tree, and Timms, who's
    especially great with her weary vocals on ""Hate Is the New Love."" But they also make everyone else sing: up
    to a dozen people, including the whole band, plus local country chanteuse Kelly Hogan and pop queen Edith
    Frost.  Every big chorus kicks off with a raucous singalong or choir-like swells, and hearing everybody in
    the studio bellow together may be the best part of the album.</p><p>
    
    These eleven songs-- all new, aside from old-time weeper ""Lone Pilgrim""-- cross straight rock and country
    with shambling performances and weirdo primitivist lyrics.  The band opens with the stomping, militant
    ""Thee Olde Trip to Jerusalem"" (""The seed of the devil lives on in men""), and then switch religions to the
    voodoo weirdness and ritual-rock guitars of ""Dancing in the Head.""  And ""Winter"" lumbers happily along with
    lyrics about all the crazy pagan shit you can do in the shut-in months: ""I saw the belly of the beast/ It
    was warm and open/ Blood lay all around/ I crawled inside.""  Yeah, those Chicago winters are a bitch.</p><p>
    
    But the Mekons do just as well at slower tempos, with aching ballads (""Hate is the New Love"") and the
    warm country tones of ""Stonehead.""  And unlike many bands in their later years, when they do choose to slow
    down a little, it doesn't detract from their delivery-- they still come off powerful, angry, and inventive.
    Not many of these new songs are likely to make the band's canon (though none are less than solid); there's
    nothing new, crazy or different.  It's just their best record in years.  And if they continue to inspire
    each other at these levels, the next quarter-century should treat them well.</p></div>"|5203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5203-oooh-out-of-our-heads/|8.0|Chris Dahlen

    I'm not one to cite the post-party morning as an opportune time for musical insight, but there's something
    to be said for the lack of pretense found in those hardcore attendees still crashed on your couch, whose
    only certainty about the preceding evening was whether or not the music you played befitted their wanton
    'groove-makers.'  They're not drunk enough to be taken with a grain of smelling salt, yet not sober enough
    to allow inhibitions to deter them from stating their honest assessment.  So, when I instituted my routine
    survey amid an early morning clean up last week, I was surprised to learn that:</p><p>
<li> Beta Band were ""slamming the stanky on the hangdown""<p>
<li> FC Kahuna should return to their chosen place of exile: my discman (fuck off, that record is choice!)<p>
<li> Dianogah sounds like the Godfather or Soul arranging the boys in Tortoise<p>
    Fair enough.  When your band's comprised of nothing more than two bassists and a drummer, you'd better know
    how to funk shit up royally, and these guys most certainly do.  But beyond that, they just make such great
    accompaniment to hipster throwdowns.  Your indie-antagonist guests want to have good, clean fun, but all
    within the confines of an emotionally viable environment.  So, boy, you'd better reacquaint yourself with
    the subtle introspection of Dianogah.  And get the hell off my couch!</p><p>
<i>Millions of Brazilians</i>, Dianogah's third proper release, finds the group marrying the more textural
    work of their aptly titled debut, <i>Old Material, New Format</i>, to a formerly unseen layer of structural
    sophistication.  Nowhere is this better evidenced than on ""Flat Panda,"" a wide-eyed exercise in dynamic that
    showcases a few clever tremolo effects and the band's innate sense of melody. Elsewhere, as on the brilliant
    opening cut, ""Wrapping the Lamb, Sir,"" or the thundering ""Maria, Which Has Got Her Heart Completely Fucked
    Up,"" the band manages to breathe new life into even the most tired post-rock clichés.  And that's saying a
    lot, considering the number of instrumental artists who still believe that a modicum of sonic climax in
    every song is all that's necessary to create quality music.  (In a word: no.)</p><p>
    That said, it's tough to overlook the obvious limitations of a two-bass setup.  While <i>Millions of
    Brazilians</i> is easily the most potent and concentrated effort Dianogah has yet to produce, it still
    lacks tonal variation. Bringing in production wizard John McEntire to add flourishes of warm, bubbling
    synthesizer was indeed a wise decision here, and the record is made that much better for his involvement.
    But even the crispest production or smartest compensatory synth can't squeeze blood from a stone.  Dianogah
    have done what most artists in their situation never could have: escaped 'novelty.'  Achieving greatness,
    however, will prove much tougher.</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|2303.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2303-millions-of-brazilians/|6.8|Kevin Adickes

    one-off. With <i>Gradations</i>, sole member Mike Martinez is now four
    albums into the project, and he shows no signing of returning to the debut's
    eclecticism. In a way, the records following have been more cohesive
    statements, with Martinez choosing to explore with a given side of his
    musical persona over the course of an album: <i>Panorama</i> reflected
    his experiments with percussion and more rhythmic sound; last year's
    <i>Strata Frames</i> was more vaporous and ambient.  While I've enjoyed
    these records to varying degrees, I can't help but pine for the debut's
    sense of unpredictability.</p><p>
    
    After releasing the first two albums on his own Deluxe label, and <i>Strata
    Frames</i> on the fledging French imprint U-Cover, Martinez moves to the
    celebrated Mille Plateaux for <i>Gradations</i>. Mille Pleateax has lost some
    prestige since its late-90s peak, but massive respect is still due the whole
    Force, Inc. network for being at the center of the most interesting
    developments in electronic music over the last ten years. And there's no
    question that where Electric Birds are now fits with the label's aesthetic.</p><p>
    
    What's surprising about <i>Gradations</i> is the amount of gritty funk
    Electric Birds adds to the usual mix.  Actually, to clarify, when I say
    'gritty' I'm talking about the stuff that gums up the rollers in a laser
    printer, not the dirty sweat that slides down from an armpit to a waist.
    Still, no other word but 'funk' could possibly describe the momentum that
    builds through ""Astral Traveling,"" as the customarily gorgeous keyboard
    drones join forces with a shuffling beat and the tiny blip of a slap-bass
    riff. Also noteworthy are the guitar accents that give ""Cyclist"" and ""Painted
    Rooms"" a satisfying organic counterpoint. ""Painted Rooms"" is particularly
    affecting, as the bassy acoustic guitar picking imparts a dark force that
    forms an interesting contrast to the glowing, cheerful synth pattern that
    dominates the tune.</p><p>
    
    ""Painted Rooms"" and a number of other tracks work the now-ubiquitous
    microhouse beat into the equation, but Electric Birds' attempts at punchy
    rhythms feel much more satisfying here than on <i>Panorama</i>. Martinez
    seems to have developed his ability to make the right beat work with each
    piece. The title cut, easily the most dub-influenced track to date for
    Electric Birds, matches the hard panning and phasing effects with a faint,
    steady kick drum, giving the unpredictable foreground a steady base to
    work from. Taking a slightly different tack, ""Rian"" combines eerie sound
    effects with a click + cut variation on the two-step beat.</p><p>
    
    Still, despite the rhythmic progressions evident on <i>Gradations</i>, deep,
    textured synth patches remains Martinez' bread and butter. It really is
    difficult to get to the bottom of why the gurgling clusters of sound in
    ""Nightriders"" and ""Radia"" are so moving. Maybe it's me, but Martinez' way
    with a heavenly drone is almost unmatched these days, equaling the raw sound
    construction of Windy &amp; Carl. The complaint I have with <i>Gradations</i> is a
    familiar one with Electric Birds: a few tracks just go on to long, and don't
    have the variation or development to justify the repeated loops. But the
    good stuff here makes these moments of tedium well worth sitting through.</p></div>"|2727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2727-gradations/|7.9|Mark Richardson

    blues and channeling classic rock through a decidedly riot-grrl filter.  Stylistically, the group veered
    toward the seedier side of blues-infused rock and roll, but coming, as they did, from a middle-of-nowhere
    burg, their sound seemed somewhat less of a contrivance than that of their like-minded peers.  Which is not
    to say they do it better, just that it seemed a bit more authentic.</p><p>
    
    And now we arrive at their follow-up, <i>Arkansas Heat</i>, the results of which are mixed but still largely
    entertaining.  Pitchfork policy demands that I review the CD version of this EP, though I suspect the mangled
    sounds of <i>Arkansas Heat</i> would be pleasantly exaggerated if played on an terminally fucked turntable.
    It's that kind of music, with shades of classic rock subversion permeating each dense guitar blast, and Beth
    Ditto's growling, vaguely feline vocals perfectly compliment the rough-edged sensibilities of guitarist
    Nathan Brace and drummer Kathy Mendonca.</p><p>
    
    The record's first five tracks pummel at near-lightning speed, with songs like ""Rules for Luv"" magically
    evoking both the Rolling Stones and Gang of Four, and the exuberant, driving chorus of ""Ain't It the Truth""
    coming so strong it nearly redeems the track's blatant self-consciousness.  These eventually build to ""(Take
    Back) Revolution,"" a 10+ minute-long fractured jam that has Beth Ditto singing, ""Okay, this is for the kids/
    So I wanna hear you loud, and I wanna know/ You want revolution/ And can you feel it?/ Are you ready/ Take
    back!/ Revolution!""  Putting aside my personal qualms with bands who namecheck 'the kids,' it's a coy maneuver
    to resort to these Huggy Bear-like ideological theatrics over a rousing Howlin' Wolf-style guitar line--
    especially since the former helped to complicate rock music's sexual politics, and the latter can be used as
    a tool to effectively <i>silence</i> conversations about sexual politics if played in the right context.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there's always been a political undercurrent in The Gossip's vintage juke-joint; their friction
    between sound and lyrical content is like Kathleen Hanna reading the Riot Act at a Delta Blues festival.
    Which is kind of fun, so long as the message doesn't overwhelm the music.  You see, <i>Arkansas Heat</i>
    does, however subtly, mark a shift towards Olympia's trademark scene, which, if not properly restrained,
    could compromise the essential 'fun-having' factor in the their blues-rock equation.  Fortunately, they're
    still in the clear this time out.  Still, if they want to remain unalloyed amongst the ever-growing cadre
    of rock and blues revivalists, they'd better keep their collective heart just west of Memphis-- in Searcy.</p></div>"|3535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3535-arkansas-heat-ep/|6.5|Alison Fields

    They may not always be great, they may not always be enjoyable or even
    <i>tolerable</i>, but no one sounds like they do.  Combining vintage
    noisemaking machines, computers, unusual percussion, and discarded toy
    instruments, Scratch Pet Land made an otherworldly and (at times)
    compelling racket on their debut full-length back in 2000. Influences
    were undetectable, instrumental sources puzzling. It sounded like nothing
    but Scratch Pet Land.</p><p>
    
    Now Laurent and Nicolas Baudoux have expanded the Scratch Pet Land project
    and given it a new name: the Fan Club Orchestra. In 1999, The Brothers Baudoux
    assembled ten friends and had them improvise on Game Boys, samplers, flutes,
    harmonicas, turntables, mouth harps, and god only knows what else, all under
    the direction of Laurent, who gave detailed instructions to the Orchestra
    via overhead projector. The resulting cacophony was then mixed down and
    edited. Believe it or not, there is now a Fan Club Orchestra Japan, started
    by an early participant in the Belgium chapter. He brought the communal
    noisemaking format back to his homeland, and FCOJ just might release a
    record of its own down the road.</p><p>
    
    To be completely honest, the most beautiful thing about the Fan Club
    Orchestra is the concept. There's a small black-and-white photograph of a
    recording session on the back cover of the record, and you can feel nothing
    but joy gazing at the dozen or so folks sitting on the floor with their
    guitars and electronic devices. The idea of a group of people, some of whom
    are non-musicians, coming together to get all drum-circle with their
    battery-powered gizmos seems like a total blast to me. It's the polar opposite
    of IDM's primary archetype: the pale, bald-headed shut-in sitting alone in
    front of a computer monitor.</p><p>
    
    The music, even though it doesn't come close to matching the greatness of
    the communal idea and sometimes strays into ""more fun to make than listen
    to"" territory, has enough weird and inspired moments to make the album
    worthwhile.  But as with Scratch Pet Land, erecting signposts is difficult.
    The typical Fan Club Orchestra track is built around a three-chord vamp on
    some sort of cheap keyboard, with various instruments-- most of which have a
    timbre that could be best described as 'dinky'-- buzzing around this center.
    The Orchestra makes no attempt to hide the fact that close to half its
    members are making music on handheld gaming devices, instead using the
    toys to build a sweet, innocent and unpredictable world of sound. And while
    I've sometimes wondered about the authenticity of improvised laptop music,
    there's no question that these guys are making it up as they go along.</p><p>
    
    The softer, more focused tracks (none are titled), which retain a certain
    amount of musicality, are by far the most enjoyable. A couple of these even
    come close to building a groove, when the chord riffs and bits of percussion
    come together to create something that swings. And then there are a handful
    of tracks that just aren't fun to listen to, where all the tinny devices
    combine into a midrange-heavy roar. But most of the fourteen pieces fall
    somewhere in between, filled with odd textures and melodic bits that pop out
    momentarily only to disappear back into the chatter. You won't hear another
    record that sounds like this any time soon; then again, you probably don't
    need to.</p></div>"|2983.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2983-sun-papa-and-the-fan-club-orchestra-vol-1-and-vol-2/|7.1|Mark Richardson

    right around October 26th, 1993, with the release of <i>Five Dollar Bob's Mock Cooter Stew</i>.  And when
    grunge lost its relevance to the music world at large in the mid-90s, Mudhoney simply became invisible.
    Much has been made of their continued determination to pummel a very dead horse, but old habits die hard.
    I mean, they've been rolling in the mud since it was still cool to be clean-- why stop now?  When has lack
    of 'relevance' stopped most bands, really, and why, necessarily, should it?  If Mudhoney could continue to
    belt out ""Touch Me I'm Sick""-caliber raunch, pertinence could go suck it.</p><p>
    
    But, oh, music fans, such is not the case.  So I'll waste no time getting to the point: <i>Since We've Become
    Translucent</i> is the most grinding, plodding, lumbering, overwrought hunk of sludge that I've had the
    misfortune of slogging through this year (I had to break out the hip-waders).  Yet despite this, it's not
    even particularly awful-- it just makes you work for the good stuff.  Hard.  Yeah, early Mudhoney ain't
    exactly feathery-- ""In 'N' Out of Grace"" and ""I Have to Laugh"" are like 800-pound gorillas compared to some
    of the limp-wristed sissy-boy crap that's come along since.  But now, where massive riffs were once churned
    out at light-speed, there's only the sound of what seems like a painful duty for Mark Arm and friends.  And
    the worst part is that it sounds exactly like Mudhoney-- from the ultra-fuzzed guitars, to the primal
    percussion, to Arm's vitriolic, sneering vocals-- minus all the brute, unprocessed energy that originally
    made them so distinctive.</p><p>
    
    The vocal/lyrical force is one of the few positive aspects of this disc, so I'll give credit where it's due.
    Arm still belches some of the silliest, throw-away (as in 'awesome') lyrics in rock with all the requisite
    conviction.  The words, naturally, are of tertiary importance compared to the attitude behind them, and
    that's for the best, because this is one of the band's few remaining strong points.  Few other voices in
    rock can make otherwise abysmal lyrics like, ""When you lash out against societeee/ And find yourself in
    penitentiareee/ And your cellmate says, 'You belong to meeee'/ You gotta take it like a maaan,"" sound this
    entertaining.  Seriously.</p><p>
    
    And it's not as though there aren't a few songs present that don't bring back fond memories.  If every track
    on <i>Translucent</i> had even a fraction of the passion that comes through in the screeching and wailing of
    the closing moments on ""Winner's Circle""-- home to the album's best use of horns (the only significant
    instrumental change from vintage Mudhoney)-- it might shoot the rating up three full points.  Admittedly,
    two other songs do share some of this track's pummeling <i>sturm und drang</i>:  ""The Straight Life""'s chorus
    alone saves it from writhing under its own tonnage, resulting in a strange, lurching sort of tune that ends
    up damn enjoyable; and the urgency of ""Dyin' for It"" makes it a close second for best in show.  But the sad
    fact is, the rest of this album's cuts are lifeless husks by comparison.  Even the <i>opening</i> of
    ""Winner's Circle"" drags.</p><p>
    
    The other tunes consist mainly of straightforward, generic homogeneity.  Things slow to a crawl for much of
    the album, and without the frantic drive, there's nothing but traditional song structures and ancient,
    played-out progressions.  This is the sound of Grunge Past, raised from the dead to parade its rigor-mortised
    corpse around for a few moments before returning to the grave.  And it's kinda fun, but hardly bears a second
    listen.  Mudhoney's sound is one of the most monolithic in grunge-- vintage <i>or</i> 'post'-- and back when
    the desire was more evident, there was nothing wrong with that.  But now, lack of invention has stagnated the
    band's otherwise tolerable strains of filth, and left them with a record that's too often content to be
    nothing special.</p><p>
    
    That is, when it isn't overwhelmingly bad, which, thankfully, is only for one track: the opener, ""Baby, Can
    You Dig the Light.""  This eight-minute, forty-second behemoth is interminable; its grim monotony throws all
    the most obvious failings of <i>Translucent</i> directly in your face and dares you to walk away.  Surviving
    that, the album proves to be somewhat more enjoyable, even if it tastes like unsalted drywall.  Previous
    releases suffered from the same sort of rut, but the energy was mostly there; if nothing else, it sounded
    like a labor of love.  Here, unfortunately, it just sounds like labor.</p></div>"|5493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5493-since-weve-become-translucent/|5.2|Eric Carr

My take: it's not,
    and Thirsty Ear's Blue Series is the evidence.  Despite the genre's recent bout with hard times, its
    artists-- from Matthew Shipp, to John Zorn, to David S. Ware, to William Parker-- continue to merge new
    ideas with new technology, breaking many of the old laws of conventional jazz while still adhering to
    its base policies.  With the ground broken by these artists in recent years, jazz, at least in the
    underground, is finding a new audience, and even enjoying something of a renaissance-- Blue Series curator
    Matthew Shipp broke records when, earlier this year, his <i>Nu-Bop</i> LP became the first album ever to
    debut at #1 on CMJ's college charts.</p><p>
    
    The Blue Series is tailor-made to grab new listeners and convince that jazz is alive and doing damn well,
    thanks very much, with releases showcasing this new, boundary-pushing jazz music.  William Parker and
    Matthew Shipp, in particular, have anchored many releases that take the best living improvisers and throw
    in something 'extra'-- sometimes a DJ, sometimes an programmer/electronics guy, or in this case, a singer.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Raining on the Moon</i>, Parker's quartet-- with Louis Barnes on trumpet, Rob Brown on alto and flute,
    and the extremely simpatico Hamid Drake on drums-- is joined by Leena Conquest, who sings Parker's lyrics
    with a deep, compelling voice.  Like Parker's bass, Conquest's vocals fluctuate between the bold and the
    yearning, always reaching for the fantastic from a deep-rooted center.  And what she reveals about his vision
    makes this album as essential as his other recent projects, as well as a fine place for beginners to start
    exploring, as it's probably the most accessible.</p><p>
    
    William Parker pursues spirituality through hard work.  He plays bass as if reaching heaven is a matter of
    steadily, repeatedly knocking until someone opens the door; he's one of the avant-garde jazz players most
    dedicated to the pursuit of higher purpose and heightened awareness in music, and he approaches it with a
    heavy, elemental tone.  His poetry, which he has rarely recorded, has the same character: it's full of
    images that emerge steadily and deliberately, using simple words to evoke rich colors and sounds.  Take,
    for example, these lines from ""Song of Hope"": ""I have a rag doll filled with light and when I squeeze it
    the world gets brighter and brighter.../ I clap my hands and birds fill trees with sweet melodies.""</p><p>
    
    On the album's centerpiece, the ambling, fourteen-minute title track, Conquest sings about an America turned
    upside down. Every wrong is corrected: the Native Americans take the presidency, and ""the White House is now
    the Red House""; Columbus Day is off the calendar; millionaires hand their money to the poor.  It's a great
    riff, slowly growing more serious and pseudo-Biblical when everyone who's been lynched comes back to life.
    The victims forgive their killers: ""If you knew what you did you'd be evil... and I know you're not evil.""
    The song swells and rises, yet it never erupts or loses balance: Parker and Drake stay the course, Parker's
    tone sounding like a man moving heavy furniture while Drake's hi-hats shuffle around him.</p><p>
    
    On two tracks, Parker plays an African Harp called the 'donso ngoni,' and echoes the reflectiveness of the
    New York loft jazz sound; there are also two instrumentals, the bright ""Hunk Pappa Blues"" and the ballad
    ""Old Tears,"" where Barnes and Brown stretch out beyond the commentary and interjections given to the other
    tracks.  The album generally sticks with a strident, determined tone, with echoes of 60s and 70s protest
    music-- Conquest often evokes the spirit of, say, Abbey Lincoln on Max Roach's <i>Freedom Now Suite</i>--
    yet the lyrics don't signify opposition so much as they dream of alternatives: a better world, more justice,
    watermelons that grow on trees...  These are wild visions, but they sure seem real, and even attainable,
    when Conquest sings of them.</p></div>"|6173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6173-raining-on-the-moon/|8.4|Chris Dahlen

    split EPs, with each pressing capped at a mere 2,000 copies, has collectors everywhere running around like
    toddlers with their pants off.  And they've really outdone themselves with their choice of packaging--
    these envelope sleeves constructed from thick-pressed cotton paper spare no expense.  They're even fit
    for a wedding invitation!  Oh, and I nearly forgot to mention that, for this, the fourth and most highly
    anticipated installment of the series, they've secured Conor Oberst and Britt Daniel, the respective
    frontmen of indie rock major-leaguers Bright Eyes and Spoon.  Not bad for a start-up.</p><p>
    
    On their website, Post-Parlo touts Oberst and Daniel as ""two of the most gifted songwriters of the past
    decade,"" marketing this release as both a testament to and a test against the validity of that statement.
    The label isn't the first to make such a claim, but it's almost a dubious distinction, considering the
    dearth of quality songwriters these days.  What's noteworthy about this release, however, is that Conor
    Oberst and Britt Daniel didn't simply submit two songs apiece to be packaged and peddled; these two
    heavy-hitters, best songwriters of the past decade or not, have actually <i>collaborated</i> on this
    outing.</p><p>
    
    To avoid confusion down the road, let's get our credits straight first: all tracks are performed by both
    Oberst and Daniel together.  ""Spent on Rainy Days"" and ""Let the Distance Bring Us Together"" were co-writes;
    ""You Get Yours"" is a Daniel original; and ""Southern State"" was penned by Oberst.  The songs were recorded
    in Oberst's basement, then mixed in Austin by Daniel, and engineered by Spoon drummer Jim Eno.  And, by
    dint of the collaborative format, the four songs flow together seamlessly.</p><p>
    
    In accordance with Oberst's apparently innate songwriting formula, he opens ""Spent on Rainy Days"" with a
    regret (""I wish I saved up for rainy days cause they're the hardest to be dry""), and continues with, as
    usual, an account of the angst of separation.  But the track, colored by these lite-pop motifs, is a
    winner, as Daniel's metallic guitar, alternating between sparse plucking and jagged strums, churns out
    a distorted riff that dashes beneath Oberst's strained pleas.</p><p>
    
    The difference between the two songwriters, however, becomes evident with Daniel's ""You Get Yours.""
    Written in a direct and terse style, both lyrically and musically, it's a sharp contrast to Oberst's slow,
    unfolding allegories.  Daniel's often admitted to his rudimentary ability on guitar, but we all know that
    technical skill hasn't got a damn thing to do with talent, and here, his simple, banged-out riffs burst
    with ecstatic energy.  ""I won't kick you when you're down,"" he sings amidst the fray, ""I'll pull you back
    on your feet/ When you get yours.""</p><p>
    
    ""Southern State"" is naturally more downtempo, with Daniel's southwestern acoustic guitar and backup vocals
    offering welcome depth.  Conor, meanwhile, whispers over distant drums and a gently plucked guitar that,
    at times, is barely audible.  Occasionally, Oberst's overwrought poetry paints the song a bit trite,
    yet his eloquence as a storyteller gives it the conviction to avoid coming off contrived.  It's a shame,
    though, that he continually insists on drawing from standard pop fare for his lyrical content; love,
    heartbreak and drinking oneself to death have no question been done to death at this point, and he's got
    a way with words that would lend itself well to other topics.  His unending pursuit of true love only
    detracts from what might otherwise be a truly unique vision</p><p>
    
    The disc closes out with the simple, if highly compelling, co-write ""Let the Distance Bring Us Together.""
    Britt Daniel handles vocals here, and with a voice that wavers between the hum of a power saw and a slick,
    quiet falsetto, he softly slurs his words over a swollen tongue.  The lyrics drag the song, unquestionably
    the highlight of the record, across the smooth sawdust floor of a Texas bar as Daniel subtly changes his
    pitch and tempo.</p><p>
    
    I don't know how Post-Parlo managed to convince these two to pair up for such a limited-run project, other
    than that labelhead Ben Dickey must be one smooth-talkin' son of a bitch-- it's hard enough to get two
    artists of this caliber on the phone at the same time, let alone to persuade them to co-write and record
    fresh material for an EP most fans will likely never have the privilege to hear.  But whatever the case, the
    result of this tag-team match is worthy of pay-per-view, and well worth the difficulty of tracking down.
    I'm not quite ready to back up that ""most gifted songwriters of the past decade"" bit, but I will say this:
    if these two can crank out a batch of songs this affecting their first time out, they oughta get together
    more often.</p></div>"|940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/940-home-split-ep-series-vol-iv/|7.9|Brandon Wall

    breakout album <i>Yo! Bum Rush the Show!</i>.  At the time, the military industrial complex was thriving
    thanks to the Reagan/Bush regime, and hip-hop, which had yet to be completely co-opted by the mainstream,
    was famously tagged by Chuck D as the ""black CNN.""  2002: the nations have seen some turnover in staffing,
    but the political landscape remains largely the same.  What <i>has</i> changed is hip-hop and its role in
    the national political dialogue.  In today's climate, it would be unimaginable for an aggressively political
    group such as Public Enemy to achieve the levels of commercial success and exposure that they did in the
    late 80s.  Hip-hop-- particularly mainstream, though the underground is not inculpable-- has degenerated
    into an iced-out billboard for hyper-capitalism and MTV culture.  Instead of saying ""fuck tha police"" or
    ""fight the power,"" today's hip-hop heavyweights implore their audience to buy their clothing line and obey
    their thirsts.</p><p>
    
    Hip-hop statesman/PE frontman Chuck D, realizing that the grip of corporate capitalism has strangled hip-hop's
    ability to invoke public dissent, has now embarked on a mission to redefine the cultural parameters of the
    music.  ""The [hip-hop] culture has been bought and sold,"" Chuck D recently told Bay Area DJ Davey D.  ""As a
    people, we aren't even at the packaging table.  The determination is being made elsewhere.""  So it's evident
    that Chuck D is still very articulate with his views.  What's revolutionary about <i>Revolverlution</i>,
    though, isn't its socialist-charged rhetoric, but its decentralized means of dissemination and its level of
    audience interactivity.</p><p>
    
    Since 1998, Public Enemy have established four separate websites to achieve their goals: Rapstation.com is
    a general hip-hop news site; Bringthenoise.com offers a real-time live feed of underground and mainstream
    hip-hop; and the main facet of Publicenemy.com is the message board, which is both widely popular and
    closely monitored by the band members to gauge audience attitudes and encourage an open dialogue between
    artist and audience.  Slamjamz.com, however, is perhaps the most innovative of all four-- here, the band
    made 1999's <i>There's a Poison Goin' On</i> available via MP3s, and have consistently posted instrumental
    and a capella versions, encouraging fans to manipulate them and share the results.</p><p>
    
    Last August, Public Enemy posted four a cappellas (""By the Time I Get to Arizona,"" ""Shut 'Em Down,"" ""B-Side
    Wins Again,"" and ""Public Enemy #1"") to the website, and requested visitors to remix them for inclusion on
    <i>Revolverlution</i>.  And from the sound of the remixes that ended up making the cut, Chuck D's still
    got a pretty good ear-- the tracks are disjointedly experimental, and the new sound breathes new life into
    these classics for 2002.  The ""B-Side Wins Again"" remix, in particular, really stands out. The minimalist
    yet funky drum track fades in and out, augmented by densely textured and frenzied samples that perfectly
    complement Chuck D's riotous homage to b-sides.  Not many old-school acts could pull off such an audacious
    revision, but Public Enemy have always been musically ahead of the game; their siren-laden sound collages
    provided the blueprint for everyone from NWA to Company Flow.</p><p>
    
    Noticing that audiences tend to digest mix CDs better than full-lengths in the post-Napster world, Chuck
    D sought to structure <i>Revolverlution</i> so that it mimicked the Internet mixdisc.  And in order to
    concoct what Chuck has called a ""compilation of ourselves,"" <i>Revolverlution</i> also includes several live
    selections of their classics, an interview with Big Daddy Kane and Ice Cube on the making of ""Burn Hollywood
    Burn,"" and a post-concert interview in 1992 that covers how Arizona dealt with the controversy that arose
    when it refused to recognize the Martin Luther King holiday-- a political mess that was chronicled in the
    PE classic ""By the Time I Get to Arizona.""  Of the live tracks, ""Fight the Power"" and ""Welcome to the
    Terrordome,"" both recorded in Switzerland in 1992, capture the blistering energy of the group's acclaimed
    live show and also demonstrate the international eminence of hip-hop.</p><p>
    
    Of course, while the album's structure is both inventive and successful in recontextualizing Public Enemy's
    past, it does result in diluting the focus of the new songs, a hit-or-miss assemblage of tracks addressing
    the post-9/11 political climate.  ""Gotta Give the Peeps What They Need"" kicks off the album with a sample
    declaring that ""our society is fucked up, they are fucking our brothers and sisters up,"" followed by Flavor
    Flav and Chuck D alternately screaming broken imagery in vintage PE fashion.  ""See Uncle Sam pissin' on us,""
    Chuck D declares before the chorus repeats what has become a mantra of sorts for the band: ""Before you give
    the people what they want, you gotta give them what they need.""</p><p>
    
    But the most pointed critique on <i>Revolverlution</i> seems to be aimed at the hip-hop community.  ""Gotta
    Get Your Shit Together"" addresses hip-hop's reaction to 9/11: ""Cold and dark is the weather y'all,"" Chuck
    spits over a bludgeoning drum track, ""Gotta get your shit together.""  This works on occasion, but it's true
    that Chuck no longer seamlessly spits the witty and confrontational critique that characterized <i>It Takes
    a Nation of Millions</i> or <i>Fear of a Black Planet</i>.  And, with its guitar soloing theatrics and 7th
    Octave's Zach de la Rocha-like squealing, ""What Good Is the Bomb"" may be the worst song to ever have been
    tagged with the PE name.</p><p>
    
    Yet, despite these moments when PE shows their age, they have largely prevailed with <i>Revolverlution</i>
    by revamping the very structure of how we digest music.  One can only hope that their ability to examine the
    relationship between themselves and their audience will be infectious, and that other hip-hop crews will
    pick up where the group left off.</p></div>"|6501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6501-revolverlution/|6.8|Sam Chennault

On one end of the continuum
    lies rage; at the other, joy.  Everything else-- from sadness or humor, to apathy or longing-- falls
    somewhere between.  It is a broad, canyonesque continuum, spanning genres as diverse as black metal,
    slow-core, space-funk, post-punk, and many others. But alas, there a few limited avenues of expression
    which find themselves on an entirely different plane, excluded from this continuum of toleration.  One
    of them is cuteness.</p><p>
    
    Palomar is cute. Not perpetually cute, thank god, but in spurts, Palomar are Nermal to my Garfield-- almost
    intolerable, and a major hurdle toward my enjoyment of the album-- or most adults', for that matter.  The
    basic cuteness construct Palomar employs here is a spin on pop/punk, with a heavy emphasis on the 'pop'
    part, and the 'spin' displaying all of the symptoms of an indie-polka. The polka-line isn't just a toss-off
    critique, either; tunes like ""Knockout"" or the beginning of ""Lesion"" had me tasting pierogies.</p><p>
    
    None of this is to say that Palomar aren't talented. Quite the contrary-- wade your way through the Hello
    Kitty delivery and you have a good slab of catchy, competent songwriting. One of the band's talents is
    orchestrating spunky, energetic vocal melodies. It sounds like at least three, if not all four band members,
    chip in once in a while to sing lead, enrich choruses, add counterpoint, or complete a four-part harmony.
    Tonally, the band remains fairly consistent, with treble-heavy bass, two guitars (one with a warm electric
    tone, the other overdriven), and a nasal vocal lead.</p><p>
    
    The music itself is nowhere near as stagnant as most pop-punk, though, as Palomar sensibly modulates tempo
    and intensity, like on ""Evening Falls at the Buffalo Bar,"" which shifts from a slow, one-horse trot to
    a full-band gallop. ""Up!,"" featuring two guys from the Strokes (!) on background vocals (not Julian), builds
    through a standard punk verse to a super-catchy <i>Grease</i>-like theatrical chorus and denouement.</p><p>
    
    Demographics are probably about as much of a concern for Palomar as an arena tour. But supposing this band
    had thought about demographics, it would be plainly evident that they'd reached some sort of consensus about
    females under the age of 22. I say this because Palomar plays fun, youthful music-- the kind of stuff you'd
    expect your 16-year-old girlfriend to put on a summertime mixdisc (<i>your</i> 16-year-old girlfriend--
    mine is 17, thanks very much).</p><p>
    
    The youngsters will probably enjoy this record most, but this doesn't mean you won't, too (provided you're
    over 22). If you have the stomach for a cute, carnival-fun atmosphere, Palomar just may be your very own
    orgasmic version of Whack-A-Mole. If you don't, then the Tilt-a-Whirl may be a better analogy, with this
    review playing the part of 'ominous wafting barf aroma.'</p></div>"|6128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6128-ii/|6.8|Brad Haywood

    'proper' listen. I've heard the record a half-dozen times walking around
    town and riding the bus, and I've given it a few more spins while reading
    in my living room. But for none of these did I follow Niblock's own
    instructions in the liner notes: ""...you should play the music VERY loud. If
    the neighbors don't complain before the piece ends, it's probably not loud
    enough. The ones that live a mile down the road, that is."" I live in an
    apartment populated by respectable people with real jobs who keep regular
    hours. One of them could be pounding on my door at any moment. So I'd better
    get to it, then.</p><p>
    
    Phill Niblock is a distinguished composer who also happens to have released
    very few records. Like LaMonte Young (with whom he shares many ideas about
    drone, pitch and tuning) and Maryanne Amacher, Niblock has avoided releasing
    his pieces, in part because he hates the idea of giving up control of how
    they're presented. The notion that someone might give one of his pieces a
    casual spin on a cheap stereo has been too painful for Niblock to bear, and
    so, he has presented his work in installation settings, where he can make
    them as loud and as long as he likes.</p><p>
    
    Niblock's aversion to recording is slowly giving way. This recording contains
    two versions of a 1996 piece called ""Guitar Too, for Four.""  On the first,
    Niblock recorded and edited guitar parts laid down by Rafael Toral, Robert
    Poss, Susan Stenger and David First, and then let Toral improvise on top of
    this construction. On the second, Niblock adds further improvisations from
    Kevin Drumm, Lee Ranaldo, Thurston Moore, Robert Poss and Alan Licht to the
    original mix.</p><p>
    
    Yet, despite the presence of all the high-profile guitarists and the word
    'improvising,' both of the ""Guitar Too, for Four"" pieces are total Niblock.
    All guitars were played with an e-bow, a device used to magnetically
    stimulate guitar strings, and hence, ""Guitar Too, for Four"" is pure drone
    from start to finish. There's no telling who plays what, and a grand total of
    three notes are heard, anyway.  So, then, what's the point of layering five
    guitars on top of each other of you're only going to play three notes, you
    ask? Well, Niblock's music is all about small, subtle differences, and the
    interference caused by tiny pitch fluctuations. Each guitarist is continually
    making slight modifications to his part using the guitar's tremolo arm, and
    inside these details lies the heart of the piece.</p><p>
    
    The varying pitches at which the guitars hum initially seem stable and
    unchanging, but as you listen closer, you notice the slow, gradual shifts
    happening continuously. The midtone almost imperceptibly slides below the
    high note, or two competing versions of the bass shake out of tune, giving a
    beating rhythm of harmonic fluctuation.  What's key is that each particular
    amalgamation of tones has its own subtly different emotional quality. At one
    moment the piece seems as soothing as the fluffiest Windy &amp; Carl piece
    (though there's no distortion here, make no mistake); the next it takes on
    a menacing cast, as the pitch differences start to flutter.</p><p>
    
    ""Guitar Too, for Four"" closer than anything I've heard to capturing the sound
    in LaMonte Young's Dream House.  This piece is sound as sculpture, a fixed
    object rising from the ground that's infinitely variable based on the point
    of view of the listener. But while Young's installation literally varied
    markedly based on the listener's position in the room, Niblock's piece
    involves movement of another sort: one based on where the listener chooses
    to focus his attention. I'm not going to lie to you-- this is the kind of
    record where you have to put in some work and have even more patience, but
    the payoff is there.</p><p>
    
    And now, after just over an hour inside <i>G2, 44+/ x2</i>, the second version
    of ""Guitar Too, for Four"" fades out-- and not a peep from the neighbors. Perhaps
    next time I'll give the volume knob another 45-degree turn clockwise.</p></div>"|11789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11789-g2-44-x2/|8.2|Mark Richard-San

    of Joy Division.  Briefly known as Warsaw, the foursome was one of the darkest bands to come out of
    Manchester's late-70s punk scene, and their unique sound-- filled with the urgency the genre was known for,
    but also with the tormented imagery and pained cries of frontman Ian Curtis-- was largely responsible for
    the initial success of England's Factory Records.  However, a newborn daughter and the prospect of an
    American tour could not draw lead singer Ian Curtis away from the dissolution of his marriage and a rash
    of epileptic seizures, and in May of 1980, he took his own life.  The question of the band's place in the
    pantheon is moot, of course: the remaining members went on to form New Order, pioneers of the 80s synth-pop
    that would go on to be characterized as new wave.  But one of the aims of the film is to illustrate how
    rave culture rose up in England, a vision of hope out of the bleak Manchester landscape.  New Order serve
    to symbolize that rebirth in a way, the lynchpin that ties the post-punk and early electronica eras together.</p><p>
    
    But first, some context.  The film follows the exploits of one Tony Wilson, the witty, pretentious co-founder
    of the Factory record label central to the story, and his comments in the liner notes offer some illumination
    on this vital but somewhat flawed soundtrack.  He was there for the infamous Sex Pistols gigs that took place
    in Manchester during June and July of 1976: only 42 people supposedly attended, but as the legend goes, most
    went on to form bands of their own.  Wilson reminds us that ""Anarchy in the U.K."" hadn't even been written at
    the time, but the film and the soundtrack kick off with it anyway.  So it's weird to hear this version, so
    clean and glossed with sharp production, more rock-and-roll anthem than punk call-to-arms.  Still, it's the
    fucking Pistols: the galvanizing guitar surge, the bombastic drums, and Johnny Rotten's vicious sneer of a
    laugh.</p><p>
    
    Then came the Buzzcocks, punk's great singles band.  Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto were at that same Sex
    Pistols show, though they'd already begun practicing as a band.  ""Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You
    Shouldn't Have Fallen In Love With),"" included here, bursts forward with manic energy rarely rivaled on
    either side of the Atlantic.  It's a surprisingly moving song, buoyed by Shelley's passionate, almost
    feminine vocals.  Wilson has to have a trio of punk icons, though, and so we complete the circle with The
    Clash.  Though not Mancunian themselves, the band are hardly unwelcome on this collection, especially with
    ""Janie Jones,"" surely a shock to 70s rock dudes everywhere who found themselves painted for the first time
    as squares.</p><p>
    
    Joy Division and New Order are the heart and soul of the soundtrack, though, and it's bound to sell well
    with so many of the classics covered.  From Ian Curtis' frantic urging to ""dance, dance, dance, dance,
    dance to the radio"" on ""Transmission,"" to the disturbingly prescient ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" and the
    broken appeal of ""Atmosphere,"" these are painfully revealing songs.  It's odd that the film passed over
    New Order so quickly; the soundtrack does a better job of tracking how technology slowly permeated the
    music.  ""Temptation"" provides this soundtrack's first glimpse of synth-pop with its giddy undercurrent
    of keyboards and drum machines.  Then the song that flipped the equation: ""Blue Monday,"" the biggest-selling
    12"" single of all time (it sold three million copies worldwide), where the beats and synth came first and
    the riffs only added color.</p><p>
    
    Of course, half the journey is just getting there, and younger ears might be disappointed with the old-school
    synth-sounds of the techno acts on the soundtrack.  A Guy Called Gerald's ""Voodoo Ray"" chops and loops a
    woman's ecstatic vocals, and manages to escape from the history books with the simplicity of the arrangement.
    The group Gerald started out with, Manchester's 808 State, were named after the Roland TR-808 drum machine,
    a Pandora's box that was tweaked to create many of the mutant sounds of electronica.  808 State were brilliant
    sequencers, but it's hard to deny that the canned horns of ""Pacific State"" remind us more of the Muzak you
    hear on television directory channels these days.  At least the Warner execs had the sense not to choose
    ""Contrique,"" an 808 song arrogant enough to sample the bassline of Joy Division's ""She's Lost Control.""</p><p>
    
    But what's up with the original, which occurs later on the soundtrack?  On first listen, the version of
    ""She's Lost Control"" included here seems to be the twelve-inch mix, which placed deeper reverb on the
    minimalist drum pattern.  But those signature beats have been retouched even further, and the insectile
    feedback that rose up at the end of the original mix has now been added to the front as well.  There are
    no notes to explain this anywhere, and it raises the question of why this was necessary.  Likewise, the
    cover of Joy Division's ""New Dawn Fades,"" performed by New Order in 2001 with help from Billy Corgan, John
    Frusciante and Moby on vocals.  The ensemble manage to do it some justice-- Moby really belts it out at the
    climax-- but like his cover of Mission of Burma's ""That's When I Reach for My Revolver,"" this live cut is
    too loyal to the original to justify inclusion.</p><p>
    
    It makes less sense to complain about the mixes of the Happy Mondays material-- their shambling live sets
    were given to psychedelic treatments, and the second half of the film focuses on how the crowd shifted from
    punk pits to a collective proto-rave atmosphere somewhere between the future and the hippie past it was
    partially spawned from.  So you've got the Jon Carter mix of the song from which the film takes its name,
    and the Steve Osbourne/Paul Oakenfold re-working of ""Hallelujah.""  ""Loose Fit"" actually works best in its
    original form, though, and that early-90s alternative dance-crossover apparently still had some rock left
    in it: Shaun Ryder's laissez-faire call to ""do what you're doing, say what you're saying, kill who you're
    killing"" is pretty far from the 'Peace, Love, Unity, Respect' creed the rave scene came to adopt.</p><p>
    
    Like the movie, the <i>24 Hour Party People</i> soundtrack (and its attendant liner notes) occasionally
    seems to pat itself on the back too often.  Surely the smug self-satisfaction of New Order's recent ""Here
    to Stay"" could have been switched out for something more relevant.  If influences outside of the Manchester
    scene like the Pistols and the Clash were allowed, why not Afrika Bambaataa's ""Planet Rock,"" the original
    showdown showcase for the twisted 808?  Or maybe Phuture's ""Acid Tracks,"" one of the earliest pure techno
    songs, which could have better highlighted the dialogue between Chicago and Manchester.  A Certain Ratio
    would have done well to balance out the Durutti Column on the Factory ticket.  And spout all the jokes you
    want to about Vini Reilly making chillout music-- ""Otis"" is a real dud.</p><p>
    
    What remains is a decent introduction to anyone completely unfamiliar with this crucial period in modern
    music, but as Tony Wilson writes, ""at worst, a soundtrack album is a souvenir of a movie.""  It's not clear
    how the album's revamped versions are meant to celebrate the originality of its artists, but there's a
    danger of getting the history wrong when looking back on it with colored lenses.  Moreso than most other
    situations, it affords me the opportunity to insist that you run out and buy the albums these songs were
    culled from instead, to forge your own personal journey of discovery through the era.  I can say this
    because the story's much broader than that of rockists and Anglophiles: it's a timeline shared by the
    nascent hip-hop and electro coming out of New York, the burgeoning Detroit techno and Chicago house
    industry, and the beginnings of the goth scene in Joy Division's doom and gloom.  Better to track down
    this decade's insane explosion of tangents individually than to be given a brief summary by a hit-or-miss
    marketing device.</p></div>"|7857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7857-24-hour-party-people/|7.0|Christopher Dare

    their mortal frames can bear, those who believe the boys from Interpol to be the latest shock troops in
    the battle of PR style over artistic substance.  And who can blame them?  After the veritable shitstorm of
    publicity drummed up by a certain New York City band-- one that had the audacity to <i>not</i> be the
    denim-clad messiahs of rock and roll we'd been promised-- directing a little skepticism toward NYC's
    buzzmongers is probably healthy.  Plus, at a glance, Interpol's snazzy suits and expensive haircuts seem
    symptomatic of a carefully spun image designed purely to separate money from wallets.  It's okay to be
    suspicious.</p><p>
    
    But back up.  These guys are on Matador, not RCA.  The hypester division of Matador is a guy in a closet
    (and he's only part-time); the 'spin' budget for Interpol wouldn't even be a down-payment on Julian
    Casablancas' designer leather jacket.  The fact that these guys see press at all can only be attributed to
    their die-hard contingent of fans (I'm only recently converted), and was earned purely through legwork and
    a handful of underpublicised EPs.  And now that they've won our attention, after three years of toiling in
    obscurity, it's mere icing that their debut full-length delivers upon what the whispers only hinted at.</p><p>
    
    Interpol's debut full-length is wrought with emotional disconnection and faded glory, epic sweep and intimate
    catharsis.  Inevitably, the hype exceeds return (that's why it's hype-- and, to be fair, Interpol has largely
    flown under the radar compared to most other NYC acts), but there's no getting around that <i>Turn On the
    Bright Lights</i> is an incredibly powerful and affecting album.  Loss, regret, and a minor key brilliantly
    permeate jangling guitars and rhythmic and tonal shifts-- and although it's no <i>Closer</i> or <i>OK
    Computer</i>, it's not unthinkable that this band might aspire to such heights.</p><p>
    
    Speaking of <i>Closer</i>, Interpol can't seem to shake being likened to Factory prodigies Joy Division.  The
    cause, however, isn't necessarily evident.  Indeed, Daniel Kessler's sublime, angular downstrokes follow the
    smooth confidence of Carlos Dengler's basslines, and Paul Banks sings with Ian Curtis' downcast delivery
    and dramatic flair.  The difference, however, lies in the music itself: what Joy Division played was sparse
    and jagged-- punk with a melancholy, but often minimalist bent.  Interpol, meanwhile, are punk in ethic
    alone; their music bears few of that genre's signatures, with the band instead immersing themselves in a
    grander, more theatrical atmosphere with lush production that counters their frustrated bombast.</p><p>
    
    ""I will surprise you sometimes/ I'll come around/ When you're down,"" Banks gently affirms over echo-drenched
    guitar simplicity and rolling bass, as ""Untitled"" hovers on artificial strings to open <i>Bright Lights</i>.
    The words are plaintive yet assertive, in agreement with the unsteady warble of the background, and
    they set the tone for an album that is equally paradoxical-- often bleak, but surprisingly uplifting.  Each
    of the album's eleven tracks evoke raw, unsettling need suffused with delicate serenity.  It can be difficult
    to absorb this much emotional relentlessness, as Banks unflinchingly confronts you with it at all times, but
    it's precisely this challenge that makes this record so staggering.</p><p>
    
    The visceral punch of the thematic content is backed at every turn by melody among serrated riffs and amorphous
    percussion.  Discussing the highs and lows of <i>Bright Lights</i> would just be splitting hairs, given its
    consistency, but a few tracks stand inches above the others.  Of the two songs to be carried over from their
    self-titled EP, ""NYC""'s conflicted show of conditional love for the streets of Interpol's hometown is still
    one of the most brilliant cuts present.  And as tight as the EP was, Interpol show how much more they're
    capable of with ""Obstacle 1"" and ""The New,"" the range between which is striking.  ""Obstacle 1"" is as close
    to Joy Division as Interpol gets, coupling harsh, restrained outbursts of aggression with disturbing imagery
    as Banks clearly gasps, ""You'll go stabbing yourself in the neck.""  The tense lead guitar is a counterpoint,
    giving these explosive bursts added depth, just as Ian Curtis' emotional collapses were made more poignant
    by the fragile guitar that cradled them.  By the time the album reaches ""The New,"" the anger has dissipated,
    leaving only the calm sound of sober acceptance.</p><p>
    
    The tragedy of music press is that when the buzz spirals out of control, people are apt to question a great
    band's validity, whereas if the band went largely unknown and was 'discovered' independently, so to speak,
    folks would be less likely to reject the praise out of hand.  Whether that will happen with Interpol remains
    to be seen, but as a member of the press, it's my duty to tell you, from one music fan to another, what I
    personally think of an album, and in this case, it's that <i>Turn On the Bright Lights</i> has been one of
    the most strikingly passionate records I've heard this year.  That other people I've spoken with have the
    opportunity to experience it, and that they feel similarly about it, can only be a good thing.</p></div>"|4113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4113-turn-on-the-bright-lights/|9.5|Eric Carr

A thirty-seven track
    compilation issued by an obscure, preposterously named, Santa Fe-based record label owned and operated by
    Sufjan Stevens, a guy whose claim to fame thus far is the occasional Danielson Famile collaboration and a
    well-received but little-known full-length called <i>Enjoy Your Rabbit</i>.  The disc, as it turns out,
    includes a large helping of unexceptional acoustic singer/songwriters, a couple of novelty pieces, and a
    handful of occasionally better-than-average lo-fi offerings.</p><p>
    
    Thus, I'm left with the dubious task of distilling this bounty of unmemorable tracks into something you
    might want to read about. I hesitate to tell you there are gems hidden in the fabric of this release
    (overstatement), but like most compilations, a little patience and an attachment to your stereo's '&gt;&gt;'
    button might assist you in finding something to your fancy.  Half-Handed Cloud's ""He's Not the Swindler We
    Are"" places singer/songwriter John Ringhofer's breathless quirkiness inside a synth-pop structure that at
    times recalls early Stereolab. Toronto-based Royal City's addition, the lazy honky-tonk ""My Brother Is the
    Meatman,"" is a decent Silver Jews homage with wonderfully gory lyrics.  Jason Brouwer also does a mean
    barbershop quartet paean to chewing gum that ranks as one of my favorite tracks on the album.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, Brouwer is allowed not one, but two more opportunities to undermine his first and best
    contribution.  The first, ""Run Me Out of Town,"" lifts a guitar line from a Kinks klassik almost verbatim,
    and reformats it for intimate squeaky cleanliness so that it might back up his tepid attempts at lyrical
    profundity. The second, the Beck-meets-Grandaddy-lite ""It's What You Know So Well"" barely deserves a
    mention.  And that, folks, is all the mention I care to give it.</p><p>
    
    The multiple tracks granted the artists on this compilation is mostly an irritation; if I want to hear more
    than one song by Liz Janes, I'll buy her CD.  And an artist that simultaneously channels Cat Power and Ida
    while chanting, ""Guitar... guitar... guitar,"" over-- you guessed it-- a guitar is something akin to sleeping
    in a cage full of wheezing asthmatic kitties.  Likewise, Sufjan Stevens gets four songs that, to me, all
    sound like the emotionally overblown acoustic sadcore favored by such controversial characters as Pedro the
    Lion and Damien Jurado.</p><p>
    
    But the above are not the nadir. Those slots are reserved for the ill-conceived electronica (""Bells"" and
    ""Big Room"") of Lowell Brams, whose contributions are both challenged and yet somehow saved by their brevity.
    Or the catatonia inducing, vague twee of the ladies in Lifestyles&amp;Vistas;, who use both the holy spirit and
    an out-of-tune organ to sing about their preferred conception of ""the kingdom of God"" on ""Ordinary Guy."" Or
    Matthew Haseltine's super-baroque folk instrumental numbers which I can only associate with the <i>Positive
    Vibes</i> Christmas music CDs played at art glass and ceramics galleries from November 15th to New Year's
    Eve every year since 1975. And while I'm at it, the short, witless monologues the label has included here
    are rendered tangentially viable only through the overuse of a vocoder on 'chipmunk' setting (accredited to
    ""Chatty Munchkin"").  Problem is, they're so blatantly ripped off from Beck's <i>Stereopathetic Soul Manure</i>
    that it strips them of any comic relief.</p><p>
    
    I could imagine this being a better CD, sort of, had the Asthmatic Kitty compilers opted to quality over
    quantity, which would allow for a much-better-than-average compilation with limited missteps. As it is,
    <i>To Spirit Back the Mews</i> is an exhausting mess, and seemingly symptomatic of a label that has a hard
    time saying no.</p></div>"|1848.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1848-to-spirit-back-the-mews/|4.5|Alison Fields

    Broadcast Company's ""Hockey Night.""  Then I decided that Canada jokes are all but played out in this
    post-<i>South Park: The Movie</i> universe, and besides, I couldn't for the life of me imagine why these
    two cats'd be discussing <i>Rad Zapping</i> instead of, say, actual hockey.  But, minutae aside, it'd
    have worked beautifully to narrate the breakneck stylistic shifts of <i>Rad Zapping</i>.</p><p>
    
    For you see, Hockey Night, the conceptual outfit of one Paul Sprangers, skips from genre to genre like
    little kids playing hopscotch.  Opening track ""Voice in Control"" commences with a bland drum loop before
    U-turning its way into speed metal power riffage.  ""Battlestar Galactica"" sets up shop with a video-game
    sample beat and slacker boy/girl pop vocals, but breaks into some nasal white-boy rapping over the bridge.
    Track three continues the prep-hop over music that somehow sounds like Rush's ""Tom Sawyer"" mixed with
    ""Living on a Prayer,"" yet tracks four and five find the band spitting out cracked four-track guitar pop
    punctuated with Atari squiggles.</p><p>
    
    And so on, and so on.  By the end of the journey, Sprangers has tried his hand at virtually everything
    but Bavarian oom-pah and Mongolian throat singing.  Actually, to scale back the hyperbole, the genre
    spectrum of <i>Rad Zapping</i> stays strictly within the boundaries of your typical indie renaissance
    man: synth-pop, lo-fi guitar histrionics, and ironic flannel-shirt hip-hop.  All styles we've heard before,
    but rarely juxtaposed so closely within a single album or, occasionally, a single minute of a single song.</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, all the band's personae are not created equal.  The more straightforward indie numbers (see
    ""Axe of Deliverance,"" ""StyleRaiders,"" or ""Princess Starcrystal"") expertly filter the bang-yo-head hard
    rock through a lo-fi aesthetic and shy vocalization, a la early Built to Spill... if they were playing a
    live set in a 1985 arcade.  Alongside strong, tongue-not-in-cheek tracks like these, the many 80s nostalgia
    kicks and attempts at Beck-like wink-rhyming weigh down the album with excessive kitchiness.  Other than
    some semi-interesting instrumentals falling somewhere between sound collage and DJ mix (most notably
    ""R.E.B.E.L System,"" with its eerie scratched-vinyl samples of children's songs and martini crooning), the
    non-rock pieces serve merely as novelty filler.</p><p>
    
    Far be it from me, lowly non-musically talented rock critic that I am, to advise Mr. Sprangers on his
    musical career, but the keyword here is 'focus.'  The multiple-personality disorder act might catch a jaded
    listener's ear the first time through, but runs the risk of being written off as a basement four-track
    goof for Paul and his drinkin' buddies.  To maximize your potential, young sir, go with the bleep-bloop-enhanced
    indie stuff on future Hockey Night releases, and annex the goofy stuff off to some appropriately disposable
    side project.  Actually, while you're at it, ditch the name Hockey Night altogether-- I hear CBC has some
    downright feisty Canuck lawyers.  Thank me later, chief.</p></div>"|3896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3896-rad-zapping/|6.9|Rob Mitchum

    melodies that stayed with you like burrs on a hiker.  Their sophomore album, 1997's excellent <i>Head Trip
    in Every Key</i>, delivered almost fully on their potential, expanding their sound in multiple directions--
    from crystalline ballads to sitar-fueled epics-- while tying it all together with songs most rock bands
    would kill to have written.  So why is it that since that album, they've shoehorned themselves back into
    the tight fit of their debut?   Continually retreating into their fuzzy pop sound (which, admittedly,
    they've pretty much mastered by this point), Superdrag have put all their eggs in a basket too small--
    they live and die on the strength of their hooks.  Do they deliver?  Pretty much, as their choruses will
    absolutely spear you.  But are these enough to carry the whole album?  I wish I could say yes.</p><p>
    
    For one thing, the band's verses frequently aren't as strong as the choruses, and very often resort to cheap
    couplets pulled from <i>Roget's Rhyming Dictionary</i>.  In fact, principle songwriter John Davis leads off
    the album with the lines, ""She is one in a billion/ With lips of vermilion.""  Thankfully, ""Baby Goes to
    Eleven"" is blessed with a melody about as good as they come, so you barely notice the lazy rhyming as the
    band backslaps you into the amazing chorus and never looks back.</p><p>
    
    Superdrag stick with the basic sound for the album's entire first half, and at first, it seems like it's
    going to work.  ""I Can't Wait"" rocks, and hard, too.  The band even snares you early with some hard-hitting
    vocal hooks.  The song also finds room for a guitar solo, a fine source of rock pleasure that most bands
    just don't seem to be down with these days.   ""The Staggering Genius"" is the first sign that the band isn't
    headed for any new horizons, whipping out what may as well be labeled ""Superdrag Basic Track #2.""  It's the
    kind of fuzzy riff that's fueled at least a dozen of their songs in the past, which is all well and good, I
    suppose, since at this early point in the record, you haven't had much of a chance to grow tired of it.</p><p>
    
    ""So Insincere"" pulls the tempo back, but fails to change the sound at all, and the song is considerably less
    interesting than what comes before it.  After the pleasant ""Extra-Sensory,"" with its simple harmonies and
    clean guitar jangle, the quartet bangs out another great tune, ""Feeling Like I Do,"" which mines the exact
    same territory they've been hiding out in since the mid-90s.  Great tunes are a plus for any band, but
    some sort of deviation in sound-- even a slight one-- might be cool once in a while.</p><p>
    
    The need for deviation doesn't come only in the overall sound, though.  There's this chord progression that
    John Davis really seems to like, and it's smeared all over ""Way Down Here Without You.""  I can count several
    other Superdrag songs off the top of my head that use this same progression as a background hook, and that's
    just kind of tiresome.  Aside from that, however, the song is pretty tight, falling toward the cleaner end
    of the Superdrag spectrum.</p><p>
    
    Oddly, the album makes its biggest misstep with its clearest attempt at variety.  ""Safe and Warm"" sounds so
    much like a mid-70s Eagles ballad that-- no shit-- it had me looking for the Glenn Frey co-write credit.
    Nope, just bassist Sam Powers who, incidentally, turns in two of the album's strongest numbers late in the
    game: the powerful, sticky rockers ""Remain Yer Strange"" and ""Stu.""  These songs, with their slightly
    different (but no less catchy) melodic and compositional styles are a breath of fresh air, as Davis' craft
    is almost too consistent.  ""Remain Yer Strange,"" in particular, ranks as one the record's best songs.</p><p>
    
    The title of ""Her Melancholy Tune"" basically describes the song, which sounds an awful lot like <i>Head
    Trip</i>'s ""She Is a Holy Grail.""  Closer ""Drag Me Closer to You"" moves into bluesier territory and winds
    up sounding like something that might have cropped up as a Badfinger album track.  That's not necessarily a
    bad thing (er, necessarily), but it's also the least catchy thing here, and as a result it feels somewhat
    anticlimactic bringing up the rear.</p><p>
    
    So what Superdrag have given us is essentially the same thing they've been giving us for most of their career.
    And this is my dilemma: how important is the fact that this band hasn't really taken their music anywhere
    new on this album?  It certainly doesn't make the songs any worse, and at face value, <i>Last Call for Vitriol</i>
    is a good record from a seasoned band that writes melodies like haberdashers make hats.  This makes the
    second album in a row on which Superdrag has failed to evolve as a band, and there's a bit of tragedy in
    that wasted potential.  So here's what I'll say: fans of Superdrag will like this, provided they're okay
    with more of the same; newcomers should proceed directly to their first two albums and decide if they want
    to go from there.</p></div>"|7621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7621-last-call-for-vitriol/|7.0|Joe Tangari

    to his own specifications,"" says Raymond Carver in an essay called ""On
    Writing."" I thought of that line when listening to <i>Villa Claustrophobia</i>
    by Tanakh, a project headed by Richmond, Virginia's Jesse Poe. Tanakh's first
    full-length release is the kind of album that feels less like a collection
    of songs and more like a window into a meticulously rendered universe in
    miniature. There are conventional songs here, and instrumental moods, and
    drifting ambient washes-- a typical proportion of tracks that make up an
    eclectic record. But these discrete components are designed beautifully to
    create the overall world of Tanakh.</p><p>
<i>Villa Claustrophobia</i> is shadowy, menacing, and of indeterminate time
    and geography. East, West, past and future all collide as violin, guitar,
    hand percussion, sitar and horns blend with layered production complete
    with electronic touches. It's difficult to pin down a particular era in
    the music, though it's impossible to discuss <i>Villa Claustrophobia</i>
    without mentioning the word 'gothic.'  Late-period Swans is one clear
    reference point, as are the poly-ethnic medieval soundscapes of Dead Can
    Dance, but these artists seem more like fellow travelers rather than direct
    inspirations. What makes <i>Villa Claustrophobia</i> is how it all comes
    together.</p><p>
    
    From the opening fade-in of ""In Every Villa,"" it's clear that this is going
    to be a disorienting ride. The first sound heard is the coiled hiss of a
    sitar, and then the voice of a wailing woman, reminiscent of the wordless
    vocals so prevalent in the desert music of Ennio Morricone, tracing the
    outline of a near-East melody. Echoing guitars and a rusty pile of
    industrial percussion give the illusion of massive amounts of space, and
    the combined effect of the track is a sensual atmosphere shot through with
    danger and violence.</p><p>
<i>Villa Claustrophobia</i> then shows just how improbably coherent it can be
    when Tanakh veers from the exotic mysticism of the opening track into the
    Texas-style folk of ""Pharaoh's Lonely Daughter"" (sung by Poe in a deep voice
    softer and more tuneful than Michael Gira, but with a similar sense of phrasing),
    then back to the wordless vocals of ""Devil's Interval,"" this time with a
    Godspeed-ish backing of twangy guitar and nervous, uncertain violin. These
    opening three pieces, though drawing musical elements from a half-dozen
    sources from around the globe, seem indigenous to this place.</p><p>
    
    Brian Paulson engineered <i>Villa Claustrophobia</i>, and featured players
    include Mick Turner, Ned Oldham, David Lowery, and Jessica Billey, among others.
    It's not clear who plays what, but approximately two-thirds of the record is
    instrumental. These tracks are universally dark, ominous and cinematic in
    character, but range in tone from vague drifts of cello, guitar feedback and
    sitar to clanging passages of metal-on-metal percussion set against radio
    static. The proper songs seem to fade into view when a dense cloud of sonic
    fog periodically lifts.</p><p>
    
    My favorite of these is actually a cover of an olde English folk ballad
    called ""Gently Johnny."" There's an unreal amount of tension in the lyric
    narrative, which details the ritual of an erotic encounter: ""I put my hand
    on her hair/ She said, 'I like it there,'"" eventually leads to, ""I put my
    hand on her belly/ She said, 'Do you want to fill me?'"" These exchanges are
    carefully phrased by Jesse Poe in a deep, booming voice, accompanied by
    acoustic guitar, violin and trumpet. My other favorite is ""Prayers in the
    Pavilions,"" which is like a four-inch-thick slice of 4AD heaven. Evoking the
    desolate folk of Mojave 3 mixed with the rock reverence of Opal, the track
    has the feel of a post-apocalyptic ballad-- ""Morning Dew"" for the new
    millennium.</p><p>
    
    It should be illegal to play <i>Villa Claustrophobia</i> in the daytime. This
    is not a summer record, but as the year wears on and the days grow shorter, I
    know I'll be drawn deeper into this world. A record this dark, frightening
    and sexy doesn't come along very often, and it needs to be savored in the
    proper (black) light. Hang out in this dim space long enough and your eyes
    will adjust.</p></div>"|7926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7926-villa-claustrophobia/|8.4|Mark Richard-San

The students
    more apt to bury their Buddy Holly glasses in pages of Kant or a wanky text dissecting the film techniques
    of the French New Wave are bound to get their asses kicked at recess by The Liars or Rye Coalition or some
    other group that feels the need to let off a little testosterone.  So these smarty-pants band together in
    secret, subtly veiling their high-minded leanings under a veneer of pretension-- they'll hint at their
    summer reading lists, but never let you see what's on it.</p><p>
    A rare few of these young brainiacs are confident enough to flaunt their intelligence-- listening to Ted
    Leo referencing Joyce is just one of the things that made <i>The Tyranny of Distance</i> so interesting.
    Of course, Leo is also a convenient example of how to cross the line between 'high brow' and 'you've got to
    be kidding.'  And the title alone of <i>Tej Leo (?), Rx/Pharmacists</i>, in the immortal words of another
    great intellectual (Joey from ""Friends""), makes ""the line a dot to him.""</p><p>
    That said, Comet Gain have, thus far, been something like the anti-Leo in both the smarts department and
    their approach to music: twice the pretense of artsiness, but less substance beneath it.  That is, unless
    you want to consider putting on airs as an artform in itself, in which case we could be here all night.
    But I digress.  Point is, Comet Gain have always made a sport of broadcasting there preferences for words,
    sights, and sounds as loudly as they could, not just in their liners, but sometimes even in über-pretentious
    spoken word bits on their albums.  On past offerings they've piled it on so thick-- like some sort of
    nerd-poseur desperately seeking to prove himself nerdy enough to join the chess club-- that it was difficult
    to take them seriously at times, but harder to fault them for the effort.</p><p>
    And now that I'm finally used to their odd affectations, Comet Gain have gone and shifted their lineup (again)
    to record <i>Realistes</i>, an album largely devoid of turtlenecked reference to art and culture.  What
    happened to the pomp?  The circumstance?  Well, apparently, they needed to make room in the tour van for
    better songwriting, so most of it had to go, which is fine.  Artsy pretense is fun like ogling a car wreck
    is fun, but it usually sounds like shit.</p><p>
    Old film stills of Italian realist and French new wave films litter the liners of <i>Realistes</i>, and
    indeed, frontman David Christian provides a long-winded rant on the band's ideals of deconstructing and
    rebuilding-- but without even a head-nod to Bazin! And while, according to drummer Chris Appelgren (founder
    of Lookout! Records and now the frontman for garage-rockers The Pattern), this album attempts to juxtapose
    ""a country twang on krautrock's mechanical drones,"" it appears they just ended up copping from various
    incarnations of Sonic Youth.  If you listen hard enough, you can hear echoes of <i>Dirty</i> and <i>Daydream
    Nation</i> between the reverb-drenched compositions and male/female vocal tradeoffs of Christian and Rachel
    Green.</p><p>
    Indeed, Comet Gain have narrowed focus from their previous release, <i>Tigertown Pictures</i>, and settled
    in on raw, hard-edged guitars, simple rhythmic arrangements, and heavily treated vocals to keep the listener
    at arm's length.   This, however, is not actually a bad thing, since these laid-back rock tracks keep their
    pop melodies in the driver's seat, and the band does allow occasional hints of invention to sporadically
    beam through the murk.</p><p>
    ""Why I Try to Look So Bad"" and ""I Close My Eyes and Think of God"" both typify <i>Realistes</i>' tendency
    towards lo-fi pop a la early Sonic Youth, and ""Movies"" draws on an SY sound from a few years down the line.
    The fuzzy distortion and vocals of these melodies are as competent as anything Comet Gain has produced, and
    to be fair, it's extremely listenable without succumbing to total Xeroxation-- even if it's not particularly
    memorable.  And though the hazy, droning retreads are a decent foundation, the album really shines in the
    exceptions.  ""The Kids at the Club"" sounds like a brawnier second-cousin of Belle and Sebastian's ""Legal
    Man"" and features a great intro bit like a scratchy LP of a 50s ad jingle.  It's an electric opener that's
    just out of place enough to set it apart from the more subdued tunes to follow, and the guitar vibe still
    plays into them naturally.</p><p>
    Of the notable exceptions on <i>Realistes</i>, the real star is ""Ripped-Up Suit,"" and not just because I'm
    in love with Kathleen Hanna.  For real, this song, co-written and sung by Hanna, is a much-needed burst of
    adrenaline following the two slowest, most ill-conceived pieces present.  Heavy, thrashing guitars and a
    lumbering bassline form a wall of feedback, almost concealing the vocals, which are nearly indecipherable
    to begin with after passing through numerous distortive filters.  Hanna's gorgeous spitfire delivery,
    punctuated by an occasional beautiful yelp through digital fog, is a godsend.</p><p>
<i>Realistes</i>' faults, mercifully, aren't fundamental to its sound, or as intangible as simple derivation,
    but instead confined to individual missteps.  ""Labour"" is the one truly misguided effort-- completely out of
    step with the tone of the album, it's a weird, low-key, horn-driven piece that feels like run down a blind
    alley.  It's not bad, but it's sure not very good, a strange foray into Motown that hearkens back to
    <i>Tigertown</i> in terms of unsteady lack of focus.  And, for a final negative Sonic Youth comparison:
    ""Moments in the Snow"" is as glaring and pulseless as any of the masturbatory crap Thurston Moore threw onto
    the suicide bombing that was <i>NYC Ghosts &amp; Flowers</i>, right down to the hackified spoken word.  And even
    this, if nothing else, is at least a throwback to some of the band's earlier pretensions, which I loved.
    But I'm still happier with the music.</p></div>"|1559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1559-realistes/|6.9|Eric Carr

The first is that they're one of
    the brightest, most consistently interesting outfits in IDM, and records like <em>EP7</em> or <em>LP5</em> define
    the present state of electronic dance music.  The other is that Autechre's overly clinical approach puts them
    in grave danger of running their busy-beat shtick into the ground.  2001's <em>Confield</em>, despite its
    mention as one of Pitchfork's 20 best albums of last year, practically defined what it means to get mixed
    reviews.  You could almost split its audience down the middle into those who were down with the avant-trip,
    and those who found it unengaging and devoid of visceral emotion.  I like the album, but even I would admit
    that emotion isn't the first thing that comes to mind when listening to it.</p><p>
    
    So when you're not sure whether you've stimulated or alienated your audience, what do you do?  In Autechre's
    case, they've gone back to basics.  The music on their freshly released five-inch, three-song EP, <i>Gantz
    Graf</i>, finds them revisiting the 'D' in IDM, as they have to varying extents on just about every release
    prior to <em>Confield</em>.  Does that mean they were listening to their detractors last year?  Or does it
    mean that they simply had some groove left in their brains after so much abstraction?  Who knows?  Maybe
    they were just dicking around in the studio and felt like releasing an EP.</p><p>
<i>Gantz Graf</i>'s opener and title track wastes very little time hitting you with over-the-top beats and
    a distorted mix.  There's a punchy melody comprised of successive synth jabs and some of the usual glitch
    trickery.  But this track will immediately catch the ears of folks expecting more random chin-stroking music,
    as during its first half it features <i>actual recognizable beats</i>.  Even the overdriven production
    can't obscure the clear rhythm.  Of course, about a minute into the tune the beat begins to disintegrate,
    leaving only the melody to twinkle in the gaping void.  Then, a while later, even that gets consumed by the
    twitching computer noise, and by the track's end, Autechre have locked us back inside their signature
    confusion and manic drill-glitch.</p><p>
    
    ""Dial"" is the most straightforward song of the three, with a fast bounce-beat featuring some goofy organ
    patches and that snappy, Autechre-patented vacuum-pop rhythm track.  If this song has any place in the canon
    of a band who were said to have sold their souls to the chaos theory devil with <i>Confield</i>, I don't
    know where it is, what with its similarity to 80s new wave quirk.  It's a bit on the speedy side, otherwise
    you might even consider dancing to it.  And deep in the mix lie some very treated vocals, though I can't
    decipher whether they're saying anything or just getting chopped up for the sake of filling out the
    arrangement.  But at a runtime of just over six minutes, this is probably the closest the duo has come to
    straight club music since 1997's <i>Chiastic Slide</i>.</p><p>
    
    The final track is the epic ""cap.iv,"" which finds the sound only slightly more abstract-- at least at first.
    The tempo is similar to that of ""Dial,"" though the beats are considerably more cluttered due to what sounds
    like a couple of competing electro-figures running concurrently.  A straightforward piano line and an
    announcer who sounds stuck in a cavernous airport terminal play beneath the chattering percussion, adding a
    subtle but affecting texture.  The track makes the Autechre strategy plain: lay an attractive backdrop
    behind restless, seemingly chaotic (emphasis on 'seemingly') blips and clicks.  The backdrop here, however,
    is somewhat prettier than usual, and I wonder whether the beat that obscures it was only placed in front
    to appease fans of the tried-and-true Autechre way.  As the track wears on, the intruding rhythms grow
    progressively louder and busier, and a good nine minutes later have utterly overwhelmed the other elements.</p><p>
    
    The videos offered on <i>Gantz Graf</i>'s additional 5"" DVD disc-- including a revamped version of an older
    video by renowned Aphex director Chris Cunningham-- are of only marginal interest to fans, as they're no
    less abstract than the music.  Chances are, you'll watch them once and shelve them indefinitely.  And as for
    the music, nothing here should come as a surprise if you've been paying attention to Autechre's recent
    releases, unless you expected them to go even further out than <em>Confield</em>.  My guess is that these
    tracks are just cool-downs from that album, or possibly warm-ups for the next, because other than the
    refinement of ideas they've already realized, there isn't much new to report.</p></div>"|362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/362-gantz-graf-ep/|7.0|Dominique Leone

    underground hip-hop defined itself as a movement.  A loose artistic aesthetic was established, the
    independence-as-freedom stance was cemented, and the key elements (breaking, emceeing, DJing, and
    graffiti) were revived for a new generation of b-boys and girls. Although one cannot downplay the power
    of the Internet to spread the message to those in non-urban locations, Fat Beats Records acted as a
    physical epicenter for the renaissance of roots hip-hop. The staff was comprised of noted DJs that
    transcended their roles as sales clerks and acted as educators for their patrons and as a distribution
    lifeline for independent artists who were otherwise ignored.   The love and devotion that Fat Beats
    displayed was infectious, and as hip-hop purism and vinyl culture spread, the company branched out from
    its original NYC location and opened stores in Los Angeles and Amsterdam. They were also able to launch
    a label that has released the latest J-Zone and Atmosphere albums, among others.</p><p>
    
    If any record store/label has earned the right to release a self-aggrandizing compilation album, it's Fat
    Beats. The first compilation, released last year, was an unmitigated jewel, featuring everyone from the RZA
    to Blastmaster KRS-One to (comparative) new jacks Kazi and Non Phixion.  DJ Eclipse kicks the second volume
    off with a short intro that cuts and splices the words ""Fat Beats"" from various hip-hop tracks.  Next up is
    ""Make Them Clap"" featuring Lootpack's Wildchild and produced by none other than Madlib the Bad Kid.  After
    the long delay between the Lootpack LP, which was released almost four years ago, and Wildchild's solo CD,
    which is scheduled to be released later this year, there were doubts about whether or not the man still had
    it in him.  ""Make them Clap,"" with its infectiously funky beat and classic ""ready on the right"" samples,
    should erase any doubts about Wildchild's stature as one of the left coast's preeminent rhyme technicians.
    Wildchild sounds as hungry as ever as he spits battle rhymes in his trademark rapid-fire delivery.
    ""Ironically,"" Wildchild raps, ""[I've] been paying more dues than physically paying rent.""  While it may not
    be anything revolutionary, emcees like Wildchild personify the old school, on-the-corner mentality and the
    inclusion of this unreleased track almost single-handedly justifies the purchase of this compilation.</p><p>
    
    Fellow Lootpacker Madlib also pops up later in the guise of his bugged-out alter ego Quasimoto on his
    classic ""Come On Feet.""  The track's production, which is a fusion of ""Come on Feet Move for Me"" (from
    the blaxploitation classic <i>Sweet Sweetback's Badass Song</i>) and the theme song for the French avant
    animation classic <i>Fantastic Planet</i> (produced by Serge Gainsbourg arranger Alain Goraguer), captures
    a soulful paranoia that sounds straight outta the intergalactic hood.</p><p>
    
    Another highlight is the Saukrates and Common collaboration ""Play Dis."" The beat, supplied by Saukrates, has
    an aired-out funk vibe that's more than a little reminiscent of Jay Dee. In other words, it's a perfect track
    for Common to spit his positive and vaguely political rhymes. Leading off the second verse, Common smoothly
    rhymes, ""Stimulated by a tree of drama/ I advance on the branch of respect and honor/ A patient of the ill
    state, centered in trauma."" If nothing else, the track whets our collective appetite for Common's upcoming
    LP, <i>Electric Circus</i>, and establishes Canada's Saukrates as one of the few emcees who can hold his own
    when faced with Common's complex metaphors and wordplay.</p><p>
    
    With the unreleased song ""My Song,"" Minnesota-based Atmosphere also comes with a lite and funky production
    that is reminiscent of Jurassic 5's ""Concrete Schoolyard"" or 4th Avenue Jones' ""Back in the Day.""  Vocalist
    Slug initially picks up on the childhood reminiscence vibe the track begs for, rapping, ""Sitting on the steps
    with Ant... flipping pig Russian, discussing politics and contraband.""  However, as the track progresses,
    Slug's imagery grows darker and more aggressive until the song becomes a taunt to his critics who are
    ""sleeping on life and writing the same scriptures"" and act ""like they don't know the words to my songs.""
    While the whole I'm-fucking-your-wife diss that the song dissolves into is a bit played (at best), Ant's
    sweet and slow production keeps the song afloat and contrasts nicely with Slug's dark and personal lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Other highlights include the Alchemist number with Twin of the Infamous Mobb (aka Mobb Deep). The song
    features a back-and-forth lyrical duel between Alchemist and Twin, contrasting Alchemist's privileged
    upbringing with the inner city horror of Twin's childhood.  ""We used to play with guns,"" Twin raps, shortly
    followed by Alchemist declaring, ""We used to play ball.""   The lyrics follow the Alchemist (who rarely rhymes)
    and Twin through their respective lives until they're ultimately brought together by a love of hip-hop.  It's
    an interesting look at the two different spheres of the genre, and reveals how hip-hop has the potential to
    break down racial and financial barriers that would have otherwise been insurmountable.</p><p>
    
    While almost every track on this disc is a certified banger, I did question some of the source material.
    Mass Influence's ""All Out,"" J-Zone's ""Live at Pimp Palace,"" the Arsonist's ""The Session,"" and ""Come on
    Feet"" are all certified classics, but they've also been circulated on so many mixtapes, compilations, and
    LPs that their inclusion here seems a bit redundant.  I'm sure that the peeps at Fat Beats have a small
    vault of incredible b-sides and unreleased jewels that would make even the most seasoned digger jealous.
    Why not give us a little more underground love?  I also wondered why Fat Beats, which is the Mecca of DJ
    culture, didn't release a mixed version of this album. With the advent of filesharing and CD burners, most
    of the compilation's songs are easily attainable without having to drop a penny. And when you have DJ like
    J-Rocc or Shortkut providing their own interpretation of the songs, it gives the consumer a greater
    incentive to plop down their $14.  Still, these are minor, peripheral complaints and should in no way
    discourage anyone from checking out this great compilation.  This is a worthy reflection of the kingdom
    that Fat Beats helped create, and I can't wait for a volume three.</p></div>"|1887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1887-fat-beats-compilation-vol-2/|7.9|Sam Chennault

She don't use Tweedy. She don't use the
    Jayhawks, or any of these. She uses Varnaline. Varnaline.</p><p>
    Varnaline, the brainchild of singer/songwriter Anders Parker, former
    member of indie-rockers Space Needle is what she uses, and she uses
    them for a reason. Varnaline fills her need for vocal twang and
    conflicted self-expression that she can only find in the alt-country
    genre, except Varnaline delivers the goods with significantly less
    friction. Less grit, more moisture. Warm, soothing moisture.  Like
    a salve.  A salve that soon anesthetizes.  Numbing.  Soporific.
    Unexciting, unremarkable and passive. More Ben Gay than Vaseline. But
    certainly not coarse, and certainly inoffensive.  Easy to digest.</p><p>
    But engaging, no. Briefly, an overview of what you'll be missing when
    you don't buy this album: ""Still Dream"" features Parker singing in a
    hushed/muffled voice about how he ""still dreams."" It's got some
    double-bass, some mandolin, a steel-stringed acoustic guitar, a
    birdie chirping, and a little drummer boy towards the end. Very
    drab, despite the birdie's best efforts.</p><p>
    Then comes the requisite gritty-rocker called ""Song,"" which 'isn't
    good' in the same way the Steve Miller Band 'isn't good.' The song
    after that is nondescript. Proceeding to track four, ""Blackbird
    Fields,"" something in Parker's bag of tricks begins to click. It
    opens with nifty production, all feedbacky and such, then settles
    into pure, fingerpicked mope. Parker revisits his hushed/muffled
    voice, to greater effect this time, and raises the hopes of the
    listener (just a little bit).</p><p>
    Track five, ""Blue Flowers on the Highway,"" dashes those hopes. Parker
    lays down hackneyed übertwang, replete with übertwangy stringed
    something-or-other (Dobro? Lap steel? Tell me your name). It's got a
    pop song structure, and had me thinking I hadn't listened to Chris
    Isaak's <i>Baja Sessions</i> in a while (meaning three years).</p><p>
    Do you have the idea yet? The slow learners say no, so let us plod
    further along this 15 track boulevard: ""The Drunkard's Wish"" is a
    brief banjo solo played by a retard. The not-that-horrible ""Difference""
    cuts the retard off short, then sets into a predictable folk/slow-core
    stylee (probably not composed by a retard, unless said retard were
    highly functional). ""Anything from Now"" does not improve the album.
    No, wait-- it actually does. It sort of rocks. But ""Down the Street""
    definitely doesn't. Horrendous lyrics, a ridiculous use of a glottal
    vocal flair (see: Britney Spears), and a shameless rehashing of the
    shitty melody Parker already used once on ""Song.""</p><p>
    As track nine comes to a close, I have had it, and I'm checking out.
    No more Varnaline for Haywood. Six more tracks and I'll be kicking my
    dog, whom I love and who, as of now, still loves me back. The warm,
    moist soothing has officially reached my nerve endings.  Numbing.</p></div>"|8418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8418-songs-in-a-northern-key/|5.6|Brad Haywood

    a decade now has been one of indie rock's brightest outposts.  He was a founding
    member of Cerebellum, the band that spawned Rodan, Matmos, and Crain (of which
    he was also a member) and helped give rise to the local scene.  And after dropping
    from the spotlight for a few years, and settling into the role of sideman for
    Louisville's various successor bands like the For Carnation and Aerial M, he's
    turned up again with Parlour, his first new project in years.</p><p>
    
    Consistent with its regional origins, the music of Parlour could only be referred
    to as 'post-rock' these days-- the term and a couple of its various definitions
    simply fit like a glove.  Parlour play long, drawn-out, slowly developing
    instrumentals that rely on simple motives to carry them forth.  There's not
    much of a sense of urgency in the music, and it seems that there wasn't in
    the studio either-- it took over four years for this album to be completed.</p><p>
    
    Four years is a damn long time to work on seven songs, and it's a testament
    to the consistency of their craft that the band sounds more or less the same
    from track to track, and that the mood remains cohesive.  And this is all
    despite the fact that it was recorded at two separate locations over the course
    of a couple of minor personnel shifts.</p><p>
    
    The basic foundation of the Parlour sound is exceedingly simple: a basic,
    steady mid-tempo rhythm garnished by the occasional off-center drum fill, a
    creeping, repetitive bassline and some sort of clean rhythm guitar part,
    usually playing arpeggios.  To this, textures are added with guitars and
    synths, building to points of high density and then receding to something
    more skeletal before doing it again.  The sounds snake together like so many
    tentacles, but there aren't many suction cups in the way of, say, memorable
    melodies to stick to you.</p><p>
    
    As such, <i>Octopus Off-Broadway</i> is very much a record of the current
    moment.  It's enjoyable to listen to, but when it's over, it's over.  Nothing
    really stays with you when it ends.  That said, as it plays, ""Mperfect"" is a
    thick wall of rhythm and texture that will effectively blanket your surroundings
    with sound, while the drumless ""Sleeper"" is a relaxing, almost new agey
    interlude.  The synth tone that enters toward the middle to play a sort of
    wandering melody line is really the album's only blatant misstep, sounding as
    though it could have come straight from the general MIDI soundbank, but the
    washes of sound behind it largely compensate.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with shimmering, aquatic xylophones before the drums crash in
    with a fractured march, and a woozy bass spills like a cloud of ink all over
    everything.  You can almost visualize our cephalopod friend from the cover art
    jet-propelling himself across the ocean floor in search of crustaceans to scoop
    up and turn into snacks.</p><p>
    
    The octopus' off-Broadway adventures close with several minutes of dark
    ambience that end ""The Living Beginning,"" an oddly disconcerting finish to an
    album that, for the most part, remains steadfastly consonant.  And as much as
    it's largely pleasant, it's also pretty ephemeral, leaving little trace of
    its presence when the disc stops spinning.  Still, though it won't do much to
    win any new converts, it will undoubtedly please fans of all things post-rock.</p></div>"|6176.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6176-octopus-off-broadway/|6.8|Joe Tangari

    substantial amount of money on Spoon coming out on top.  On top of what?  Of anything.  That album was the
    sound of a band that had nailed their particular aesthetic to the wall, or so I thought.  Spoon was ready;
    Spoon was there; and then, fatefully, Spoon was dropped.  Monsieur Laffitte, the Elektra A&amp;R; man whose
    villainy was immortalized on the band's <i>The Agony of Laffitte</i> EP, set them adrift.  Now,
    few things fuck with a band like being dropped by their label (taking third place behind smack, and of
    course, suicide), and indeed, something changed in Spoon.  Freshly cut loose, they suddenly decided to go
    'respectable,' cleaning up their sound as if to win back Laffitte's heart while deriding him in song.</p><p>
    I'll be candid: at that point, I missed Spoon.  <i>Girls</i> was swell, but its slickly produced lounge
    grooves only made me long for the casual ""just swung by the studio to drop off some tunes"" brilliance of
    <i>Sneaks</i>.  Nothing on it could ever generate the massive, ultra-condensed endorphin rush of ""Car Radio.""
    Fortunately, somewhere between there and here, Spoon took the time to burn their sound down to its foundation,
    dissect the sullen intricacies of <i>Girls</i> using <i>Sneaks</i>' barbed, melodic hooks, and reassemble
    something out of the pieces that's far more than the sum of its parts.  The result, <i>Kill the Moonlight</i>,
    plays like a greatest hits compilation not of songs, but of sounds-- the best echoes of everything Spoon has
    done swirl around and unite.  Bowie soul seamlessly flirts with Spoon's deceptively simplistic rhythms and
    vocals that span all the hope and hopelessness of the human condition.</p><p>
<i>Moonlight</i> plays out as if Spoon is standing dead center in a vast, empty warehouse.  Thousands of
    seats are placed close to the band, and there's a drawn-out nervousness-- total silence-- before they
    produce a single sound.  At that moment, a Hammond-esque drive kicks off ""Small Stakes"" with enough energy
    to get even a factoryful of hipsters doing the wave.  And then you look around and realize that you're the
    only person in attendance.  This record is an adventure in starkness, beyond <i>Girls Can Tell</i> even
    while evoking some of that album's finest moments.</p><p>
    But any hack band can create space, right?  Maybe.  But using it is the tricky part.  Like some of the best
    minimalists in music, Spoon use the null and void to create tension which bolsters and sets apart every
    nuance of the music-- every handclap, every reverberating crash, every beep from the synthesizer.  ""Paper
    Tiger,"" in particular, effortlessly floats into of the realm of the hyper-real; there's nearly more silence
    than music.  Spoon has always struck me as a band that, no matter how good the rest of their album was, could
    always be relied upon to produce at least one or two songs every album that would make my jaw drop (""Car Radio,""
    ""Everything Hits at Once,"" ""Lines in the Suit"").  And while <i>Moonlight</i> has far more than its fair share
    of stunners, ""Paper Tiger"" blows them all away.  Daniel distantly croon-growls, ""I'll never hold you back/
    And I won't force my will/ 'I will no longer do the Devil's wishes'/ Somethin' I read on a dollar bill,""
    over reverse-playback beats, solitary piano chords, and drumsticks; nothing else.  It's an effect of
    singular elegance and power.</p><p>
    The rest of the album is largely more upbeat, fortunately, or it could have slipped into a fugue.  A little
    of the guitar braggadocio that netted the band so many past comparisons to the Pixies, and older acts like
    Wire, is showcased on ""Jonathon Fisk.""  The riffs hit hard and fast, and some of the horns Bowie once used
    on <i>Hunky Dory</i> drop by to lighten things up.  Later, the rock piano stylings of Jerry Lee Lewis could
    shed a tear for catapulting the bittersweet ""Someone Something"" into the ""best of"" section of Spoon's
    catalog.  Bright-eyed optimism and the faintest hint of the uncertainty of expectation are conveyed through
    the staccato piano, and the vocals build and carry it off to a beautiful conclusion.  Also of note: ""Something
    to Look Forward To"" may be the best fusion of older and newer Spoon to date, and ""Stay Don't Go"" will likely
    be your only chance to experience a sample of Britt beat-boxing.  Truly surreal.</p><p>
<i>Kill the Moonlight</i> is a hailstorm of complex emotional underpinnings; sometimes vibrant, sometimes
    morose, but usually in a frighteningly anxious limbo.  ""Vittorio E"" closes shop and turns eyes toward the
    future with a 3\xBD-minute synopsis of the album's emotional heft.  Choir-like harmonies fade in from the
    depths behind the main vocal, and a simple, sweet piano refrain lifts it away from any of the sadness or
    trouble left behind it.  It never looks back.</p><p>
    Indeed, Spoon's latest is their magnum opus to date; it takes a scalpel to the highlight reel of their
    career, cutting and pasting a 35-minute tour de force that ends too soon. And yet, despite all the elements
    Spoon has toyed with over the years, it doesn't sound distinctly like any of them.  In fact, this all feels
    like a decidedly different Spoon, like the real start of the next phase for which the merely likable
    <i>Girls Can Tell</i> was only a bridge.  So be prepared.  The difference is in the distance.</p></div>"|7428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7428-kill-the-moonlight/|8.9|Eric Carr

    That subtle lily of eighties comedy, Sam Kinison, had a routine about what a bummer it would be to be Jesus'
    brother, with Mary and Joseph always saying, ""What's <i>wrong</i> with you? Why can't you be more like your
    brother Jesus? He does <i>everything</i> right.""  I cling to Sam's stirring vision of the jilted sibling
    every time you get compared to your brother Will.  The other kids at school chide me, ""Anomoanon sounds like
    the Grateful Dead, ass,"" and then they beat me up and caulk my navel. One even slandered my choice of
    sneakers, saying, ""I tried to get some shoes like yours, but my quarter got stuck in the machine.""  Cold!</p><p>
    
    Ned, I've been your fan since Palace was a Brotherhood. The controlled tremble of your what-if-Neil-Young-could-surf
    voice nailed your enigmatic brother Will to our planet. I often skulked around you on summer tours, inspired
    by the brashness of your flip-flops.  When you guys were practicing for the Lost Blues tour in Charleston,
    South Carolina, I crouched in the dunes at Folly Beach and watched you boogie board.  (<i>Let's see those mean
    kids pick on</i> his <i>shoes</i>, I thought.)  A patrolman wrote me a ticket for screwing up the grass.</p><p>
    
    Years ago, when your bandmates the Stith brothers announced a Ned-fronted project, I ran out to get the first
    Anomoanon seven-inch, ""Hello My/The Free Web."" I don't think you've topped its festive brooding yet, though
    the album and EP of original material each had their strengths. And you should have seen how the other kids
    at school reacted to my championing your <i>Mother Goose</i> album that celebrated the bawdiness and
    gothicness of oral-tradition nursery rhymes.  Then, when you did the album of Robert Louis Stevenson
    children's poetry and I did a report on it in class, someone filled my back bicycle tire with weevil urine
    and punctured it just enough to squirt a mustard line down my back.</p><p>
    
    So now, Ned, you've released an EP of Francois Villon poems set to your scrappy, moody harbor-rock. Oh, okay.
    ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME KILLED? You <i>knew</i> I would go purchase it and love it! <i>And</i> that the
    other kids just associate the French with some caricature of frou-frouness. They'll think Villon a squinting
    snoot, unaware that he was the consummate ne'er-do-well, robbing churches, killing a priest, and hosting many
    a street fight. I'm reckoning that the cover's gothic woodcut of three hung figures is a reference to how
    many documented times this poet barely escaped the noose.</p><p>
    
    Your impossible-to-overlook brother has put the work of several poets to music, including D.H. Lawrence and
    Rabindrath Tagore. You guys are arch at being arcane. I enjoy reminding those who accuse both of you of
    pretentiousness that being pretentious involves pretending. And neither of you are pretending to be swept
    up in what you're doing, or to know something you don't know.  TV culture, though, curse its rank abortive
    porridge, has people thinking that saying you're into anything outside its narrow window of instant
    gratification is pretentious, even if you passionately and authoritatively enjoy it.</p><p>
    
    This EP of yours is a culture casserole, hurtling the listener through various centuries and to various
    countries and mead halls, except it's always twilight. ""John of the Slum"" almost reaches a breaking point
    of how much a song can goulash, with you singing French in your Kentucky brogue while playing stumbly
    flamenco.  ""Ballade of Villon and Fat Margot"" is a classic slop-country chronicle of Epicurean hollowness.
    You sound exhausted telling the world that ""I am her pimp and she my prostitute be.""  Villon raised his
    hell in the 1400s; most of us dingleberry Americans think the Beats invented decadence. The digital lacquer
    on your voice helps you slink around the phrasings, building to that chorus, ""In this brothel where we
    ply our trade.""</p><p>
    
    The trademark Oldham codeine-waltz of ""Ballade of Good Doctrine to Those of Ill Life"" is held together by a
    Dylanesque harmonica line that leads lazily into the next ""Ballade""'s trippy wailings. I'll recommend this
    (via the Internet, Ned, because the kids at school will just drag me out to the parking lot and make me lick
    their Talons' gas caps) to any fan of My Morning Jacket's indulgent, reverby psychedelia. I hear echoes of
    the echoes of Drag City tenants such as Plush, Papa M, and even the Pink Floyd liquiscapes of the slow
    moments of Smog's <i>Burning Kingdom</i> EP.</p><p>
    
    Well, kudos to you, Ned, for singing about doublets without calling to mind the drama-school dropout goateeans

    review by writing, ""For those of you who like this sort of thing, you'll find this the sort of thing that
    you like."" The problem for the new head-scratch of an album by Stuart David's Looper is that it's not even
    of a ""sort.""  In fact, it blends hints of so many genres and idioms that it becomes genreless and idiomless,
    leaving me only to proffer oxymorons like ""white-noir"" and ""anglo-funk.""</p><p>
    To further complicate critiquery, the album boasts a song called ""Driving Myself Crazy"" on which David sings,
    ""I'm driving myself crazy,"" over and over and then some more. Then he sings, ""I go on and on and on and on
    and I won't shut up,"" over and over and then some more.  So the next line is, ""I'm trying not to listen but
    it just won't stop."" Now that's like handing a reviewer a brass bedpost with 'Bludgeon Me' stenciled on it.
    Yet the damn song, for all its daring you to desist it, pulses around one of the album's better keyboard
    lines.</p><p>
    Looper's first single introduced folks to the notion that something could be stank up in Belle and Sebastian.
    As the group cloyingly became more a collective than Captain Murdoch's Tuneful Melancholy Express, the spoken
    word-y Stuart David went and decided, like Whitney Houston, never to walk in anyone's shadow, bailing
    altogether from the wan clan. Subsequent releases under the Looper name perpetuated a toybox ethic of
    so-so sounds, drum machines, and stories. <i>The Snare</i> roams far enough from that turf to seem like a
    sly bait-and-switch on par with the killer-less <i>Halloween III: Season of the Witch</i>, leading the
    listener to wonder why David didn't released it under some other pseudonym (perhaps Peacock Johnson, the
    character from David's novel with whom this disc is vaguely concerned).  It'd have made <i>The Snare</i>
    the most odd such outing since Stephen Tunney squeezed an excellent rock adaptation out of his mockalyptic
    novel <i>Flan</i>, employing his Shimmy-Disc stage name Dogbowl.</p><p>
    Easy to dismiss, smirk at, or even hate on the fist listen, nine out of <i>The Snare</i>'s ten tracks are
    grind-and-pause, semi-sultry pairings of exotic keyboard settings and mid-tech beats that exploit their
    refrains and come weirdly close to the patterns of 'risqué' after-dinner radio pop circa 1999-present.
    So, let's see, how do I put this... the, er, beats, they, uh, well, never, never change or build or fade
    within a song, and since they share the same constituent elements and the same calculated mood, the songs
    fail to differentiate themselves until the nth listen, by which time the shifting vibra-tones, trumpets,
    saxes and flutes (particularly those of the dratmospheric ""Lover's Leap"") will have had plenty of time to
    slap you around their seedy motel's parlor. Cellos, violins and the occasional stand-up bass creep through
    the proceedings, as if not wanting to be spotted.</p><p>
    All the songs are... sung, which is a departure for Looper/David/Johnson, but the singing is personafied,
    a knowing, untrustable whisper that suggests lonerdom even when chronicling all manner of intimacy. The
    clichés draw hordes of flies here and there, and the blokey humorlessness nearly provokes laughter. The
    album's constipated Curtis Mayfieldisms and Isaac Hayes tinctures, combined with the cover's cold suggestion
    of a ratty, slickish corner hustler, can drive the listener to reckon Peacock Johnson a daft Shaft, or Rudy
    Ray Less. Which is still a cut above my initial response (embarrassment for David).</p><p>
    Track ten, though, provides a gloriously more interesting text. Suddenly, we're out of Mick the Rat's borough
    and among the hetero-fops and waterheads of Tweeville, only Mick's stringy ass is following us, bringing his
    inhumanity with him like a pox. I can't help but construe this ditty's spry arrangement as a comment on B&amp;S;,
    mixing David's oldie ""Century of Elvis"" with the featherweight bits of <i>The Boy With the Arab Strap</i>.
    The sweetly sung lyrics (intentionally) hilariously mix weaker B&amp;S; sentiments: ""Such a funny old feeling,
    such a beautiful day/ Come on, get up off the ground."" Except, see, someone's really on the ground: ""Come
    on, you're getting blood all over the place."" Things get worse in ways I shouldn't recount on this
    family-oriented website, but here's a peek at the chorus, after a ""don't look so frightened, dear"" a ""take
    your hands away from your face,"" a ""don't get excited,"" a ""this isn't serious,"" and a ""don't try and run"":
    ""We're only fucking around/ We're both just fucking around.""</p><p>
    Ultimately more misanthropic and befitting of Todd Solondz in its 4\xBD minutes than the entire <i>Storytelling</i>
    LP, ""Fucking Around"" first teases the wit and indirectness out of B&amp;S;'s seduction-as-a-lark canon, then
    moves on to showcase the disturbing dichotomy of tenderness and violence that complex-ifies David Lynch's
    manifestly unsafe territory. <i>The Snare</i>'s droll, wanna-be gumshoe darkness (""She's a Knife,"" ""This
    Evil Love"") ends up strangely redeemed by absolute depravity masquerading as bubble-gum. By not being able
    to gush over or pan Stuart David, I feel like I'm letting a small-time crook get away, possibly to commit
    more ambitious crimes.  And in the end, David acknowledges, and then escapes, his own career's trappings.
    But now he's the sole practitioner of what, horror-pop?</p></div>"|4851.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4851-the-snare/|6.1|William Bowers

    score films.  It's a charge that could be levied at any purveyor of instrumental music, the choice to leave
    out lyrical imagery feeding the assumption that the composer might be willing to rent out his child as
    sonic wallpaper for celluloid.  Given the many extravagantly budgeted promotional spots computer tweakers
    churn out for the odd 3:30am showings on MTV4, the electronic genus seems particularly disposed to marrying
    the visual and the auditory.</p><p>
    
    King of Woolworths, the professional handle of Englander Jon Brooks, tips its hand right on the back cover
    by including both a ""main titles"" and ""end credits"" version of a song called ""Bakerloo.""  The ten tracks of
    <i>Ming Star</i> support this thesis, residing somewhere between the hazy, lazy Tomorrowland of Air and the
    always-referred-to-as-'pastoral' densely textured vibe of Boards of Canada.  Like the former context-establishing
    band (whose sublime <i>Virgin Suicides</i> soundtrack reigns as gold standard for electronic scores), Brooks
    has a taste for organic foundations and analog synths, but with a darker edge that keeps King of Woolworths
    from becoming Zero 8.</p><p>
    
    In fact, I wouldn't be too surprised if Hollywood's music directors aren't spinning <i>Ming Star</i> on their
    $70,000 office stereos as we speak, pondering which upcoming release could best utilize Mr. Brooks' talents.
    But before you dial up Mantra Recordings on your headset telephone, Movie Guy, here's a helpful guide to how
    the better songs of the album could be used:</p><p>
    
    ""Colcannon"": With its splashy distorted drums, throbbing club beat and synthesizer flatulence, consider
    this track for that <i>Matrix</i> rip-off you've got in the pipeline.  It might not be the freshest sound,
    but that slow-motion 360-degree camera trick is getting pretty stale, too.</p><p>
    
    ""Kite Hill"": Anchored by a delicate string arrangement and some perky bass-and-drumming, ""Kite Hill"" is that
    brand of glacial atmospherics that would anchor a nice travel-across-America montage scene.  You know,
    characters staring pensively out bus windows at expanses of corn, sun setting behind mountain ranges,
    metaphorical shots of The Open Road, that sort of thing.  Pencil it in for the feature film version of
    the Nick Drake Volkswagen ad.</p><p>
    
    ""Bakerloo"": The most Air-ish composition here (due to its picked acoustic guitar and oscillating synth melody),
    it's hard to imagine cinematic uses for either of the two versions here that don't blatantly bite from <i>The
    Virgin Suicides</i>.  Hire Sofia Coppola, and use it as dressing for a soft-focus, sun-drenched flashback.</p><p>
    
    My cynicism about Hollywood's use of electronic music notwithstanding, <i>Ming Star</i> is a pretty impressive
    and affable full-length debut, even if it does lack that one unique element necessary to separate the album
    from its genre peers.  Other than slightly bothersome familiarity, the only misstep comes from Brooks' clunky
    use of film dialogue-- the respective moods of ""Stalker's Song"" and ""To the Devil a Donut"" are creepy enough
    without superfluous soundbytes from low-rent <i>Sleeping with the Enemy</i> and <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>
    knock-offs.  But in the class of Space Age-y instrumen-tronica, King of Woolworths still a earns a solid B,
    certified for pre-clubbing gin-and-tonics or the newest indie buzz-kicker from a Coppola spawn.</p></div>"|4445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4445-ming-star/|7.3|Rob Mitchum

    guiros, black pride, black power, samba, dancing boys and girls, two
    turntables and no microphones, sweet Soul Brasileiro, secret block parties,
    dozens of cowbells, trumpets, clubs, sweat, afros and all the right moves,
    Soul Grand Prix, the Culture of Rebirth, bailes black, renegade DJs and the
    ""school of music.""  In the 70s, this South American paradise for vacationing
    Americans was in actuality a tough place to live for young blacks.  Brazilian
    society offered them reduced economic and cultural freedom, yet instructed
    them to represent the ""essence of Brazil"" by 1) never leaving their designated
    neighborhoods, and 2) never bringing the influence of their Harlem brothers and
    sisters to their country.  Samba was the old party music, but young Brazilian
    blacks had other ideas.  Boa vinda a Black Rio, friends.</p><p>
    
    As DJ Cliffy indicates in his liner notes for this compilation of his own
    selections, the sound of Black Rio was difficult to separate from its
    politics.  What the Brazilian press derided as the sound of local black
    youth shamefully imitating American soul and funk was actually the voice of
    a new generation with little use for the ultra-conservative destiny set
    aside for them.  Music and dance promoter Dom Filo argued against the
    hypocrisy of white kids in the north dancing to the Rolling Stones while
    blacks in the south couldn't do the same with James Brown.  The legendary
    Gerson King (originally Cortes) typified the scene's openness to new sounds
    and ideas by maintaining a ""black is beautiful"" philosophy, while at the
    same time stating that white, the color of the clouds, was equally so.</p><p>
    
    However, no matter the unpopularity of Black Rio's politics with hard-line
    Brazilians, it was the music that gave the scene its real color.  Samba is
    the traditional dance music of the country, but American soul began to
    infiltrate Brazil in the early 60s as famed bandleaders Tim Maia and
    Cassiano played music known as 'Soul Brasileiro,' influenced by James Brown,
    Stevie Wonder and jazz fusion.  Gerson King played a kinetic, funky music
    influenced by the rhythms of Jamaica as much as Maia and Cassiano, and
    actually danced with James Brown onstage at a gig in New York.  His tune,
    ""Uma Chance,"" closes this compilation on a very JB-styled note, replete with
    horn hits and ""good God"" exclamations.  Its mid-tempo groove and way-70s
    clavinet and vamp-structure (another lift from Brown) must have suited the
    all-night party circuit just fine.  King discovered another band in the
    suburbs of Rio de Janeiro called Uniao Black whose ""Black Rio"" was Kool &amp;
    the Gang right down to the tight horns and bass up front.</p><p>
    
    Similar to King and Uniao Black, the very politically and socially active
    Toni Tornado specialized in hard, gritty funk.  ""Podes Crer, Amizade"" is
    more Bar Kays than JBs, but its bottom-heavy beat and call-and-response
    vocals (inherited from samba) were just as suited to celebratory release as
    King's stuff.  Trio Mocoto also had a knack for the celebratory, if slightly
    more traditional (sometimes approaching tribal).  Their ""Nago"" is the fusion
    of samba shouts, jungle dances and backwater funk.  This band played eclectic
    black music alongside the best American bands, but was actually more famous as
    the legendary Jorge Ben's backing band in the late 60s and early 70s.</p><p>
    
    Jorge Ben's style differed greatly from his more rigorously funky compatriots,
    in that he seemed to prefer smooth, breezier rhythms and a generally sweet
    atmosphere.  His most renowned album, 1976's <i>Africa Brasil</i>, popularized
    the Afro-Brazilian sound well outside of the country's borders.  His music was
    funky, but in a much subtler fashion than Gerson King's or Toni Tornado's.
    ""Comanche,"" culled from Ben's <i>Black is Beautiful</i> LP, features traditional
    acoustic guitar strumming, understated trumpet, and Ben's own pastel keyboard
    shadings, all over a propulsive, yet featherlight, rhythm.  It's a beautiful
    sound, and if this collection does nothing else, hopefully it spawns a few new
    Ben fans.</p><p>
    
    Another Soul Brasileiro superpower was the Banda Black Rio.  Formed in the
    mid-70s, the band weren't around for the birth of the scene, but certainly
    did as much for it as anyone else.  One of the few acts to be backed by a
    major label, BBR released three albums featuring arguably the most successful
    fusion of samba, soul and funk of any band going.  Furthermore, improvisation
    played a big role in their music, and the best players (themselves plucked from
    many of the best local bands, such as Dom Salvador's excellent bossa-funk ensemble)
    would be able to pick up the groove and take a solo at the drop of a fedora.
    ""Gafieira Universal"" is a marvel of samba and classic cocktail funk that could've
    turned any episode of ""The Love Boat"" into an all-nighter.</p><p>
    
    Some of the tunes on <i>Black Rio</i> don't hold up as well to my ears: the
    goofy instrumental version of ""Rapper's Delight"" by Gang do Tagarela seems a
    little unnecessary, as it just repeats the same bassline and beat over and
    over, with little interplay between the soloist and band (not to mention that,
    without the MC, this isn't really ""Rapper's Delight,"" but ""Good Times""!).
    Likewise, Eklipse Soul's ""Psicose"" takes a patented Kool &amp; the Gang groove
    and proceeds to add not much other than some weird screaming vocals, and
    what sounds like someone impersonating a theremin.  So, on second thought:
    classic.</p><p>
    
    Today, this music is probably going to do its best work at parties and
    clubs.  Whatever politics are embedded in this music aren't necessarily
    important when you're dancing, though they do tend to give it a darker hue
    when you factor them in.  Black Rio didn't last long as a scene, but its
    spirit undoubtedly lives on in Brazilian music (hip-hop is almost as big
    there now as it is here), and in compilations like this.  So, you can do
    one of two things: pick this up and experience the bittersweet celebration
    of Soul Brasileiro, or just dance your ass off.</p></div>"|2005.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2005-black-rio-brazil-soul-power-1971-1980/|8.2|Dominique Leone

His latest film is entitled <i>About a Boy</i>, and is based on a book
    by Nick Hornboy [sic]. I'm told that the flick is sort of like Adam Sandler's <i>Big Daddy</i>, but more
    ""boy-focused."" The soundtrack to the film, aptly named <i>About a Boy</i>, was written and recorded by
    Damon Gough, known to people other than his mom as Badly Drawn Boy. Clearly, lots of boys for Hugh to
    handle. What's a boy to do?</p><p>
    Suck it. That's what Badly Drawn Boy does with the soundtrack, anyway. I have no clue about the movie,
    although my friend told me it was ""better than [he] thought it would be"". This statement is obviously
    very ironic for two reasons; one, because it just <i>is</i>, and two, because the soundtrack is completely
    lifeless, and unlike the movie, way worse than anyone thought it would be.</p><p>
    Apart from some familiar melodic tendencies and Gough's distinctive voice, <i>About a Boy</i> sounds very
    little like <i>The Hour of Bewilderbeast</i>.  His debut was a charming one, if not magical. Magic within
    magic, even, as we got mixdisc keepers like ""Once Around the Block,"" alongside a smattering of quarter-song
    vignettes like ""Fall in a River"" and ""This Song.""  Moreover, it displayed tons of promise; despite some
    questionable production, Gough's splendid folk-pop melodies were hard to ignore, even during those one-minute
    interludes. The folk part has largely disappeared, though, and in its place stands... something qualifiedly
    worse.</p><p>
    This is not to say that a talented artist isn't allowed to grow creatively. By all means, grow-- but grow
    well. Realize that preprogrammed 80s dance-pop beats and electronic anvils (""S.P.A.T."") are meant for the
    rarest occasions, and generally spell ""barf.""  Realize the same about Doc Severinsen-style novelty orchestras,
    especially when you're determined to deliver a tune like Barry Manilow (""Above You Below Me""). And by all
    means, do not moan like an unsexed Bono (""Silent Sigh"").  Tempting?  Maybe.  But not advisable even for
    <i>Bono</i>, let alone aspiring non-Bonos.</p><p>
    There is no mystery in this music, nothing worth listening to multiple times to understand or uncover. Every
    card Gough plays is painfully transparent from the first time you play the disc. It's elementary stuff. It
    sounds manufactured, refined, cosmetic and sterile; in a word, silicone, like a pair of Badly Sculpted
    Breast Implants.</p><p>
    Other than the album's anthem, ""Something to Talk About"" (not the Bonnie Raitt song, but almost), the music
    on this disc is ""something to keep to yourself."" Corny is probably a good word to describe a number of the
    songs. Bad is another, especially the lyrics, which were never Gough's strong suit to begin with. Apparently
    unaware of how unimpressive the lyrics are to ""Walking Out of Stride"" (""You and me could never hide/ Too
    busy walking out of stride/ Take one, two, three then four or five/ People talkin' keeps us aliiiiive""),
    Gough repeats them twice, evoking only the fondest memories of über-diva Gloria Estefan and her Miami Sound
    Machine (""One, two, three, four/ C'mon baby say you love me/ Five, six, seven times"").</p><p>
    There are a couple points when Gough's facility with folk-pop songcraft manages to meld even these plastic
    parts together into something complete, as on the aforementioned ""Something to Talk About,"" a clap-along
    number comparing favorably with <i>Bewilderbeast</i>'s ""Pissing in the Wind,"" another song with a great
    hook and horrible, horrible lyrics.  It is by far the album's strongest track. ""River-Sea-Ocean"" is nice,
    too, a more polished, abbreviated analogue to <i>Bewilderbeast</i>'s ""Once Around the Block."" Altogether,
    though, even a handful of mildly enjoyable songs can't rescue this boy.</p><p>
    If you're at all like me, you're dismissing the <i>About a Boy Original Soundtrack</i> as just that: a
    soundtrack.  Probably not the artist's finest work, and probably not the most accurate representation of
    his artistic development or freedom.  Do yourself a favor and dismiss this one preemptively; save your
    money for the movie.</p></div>"|528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/528-about-a-boy/|4.9|Brad Haywood

    mention straightaway that this album isn't even half as emo as the cover art
    makes it look.  The guitars rarely rage, the meters are never odd, and the
    vocalist never wails like a possum in heat.  If I were to label them at all,
    in fact, I'd just call them a pop band, plain and simple.  Popular prefixes
    like 'power' and 'post' need not apply.</p><p>
    
    And so it goes that all over <i>The Californian</i>, the second full-length from
    the L.A.-based four-piece Sunday's Best, the guitars chime melodically, the
    vocalist never yells at you, and a guy known as James Tweedy (no relation)
    studiously offers up utilitarian basslines with a minimum of flash.  The
    funny thing about all this is that Sunday's Best used to be <i>totally</i> emo,
    but somewhere between their debut and this album, they seem to have realized
    (possibly through their own introspectiveness) that they weren't very good at
    it and would be better off moving in next door to Sloan and the Posies and
    honing their songcraft.</p><p>
    
    Critical flippancy aside, the band has undergone a lot of cataclysmic change
    in their lives between records, including divorce, exiting members, rehab and
    rough tours, and these life experiences have lent more authenticity to their
    music.  Vocalist Edward Reyes is suddenly a smooth, capable singer with a bit
    of 70s AM honey in his voice and it suits him, though sometimes the double
    tracking that's heaped on feels a little overdone.  That's hardly the only cue
    the guys take from the 70s, though, as the chorused guitars that crop up
    frequently are quick to remind.</p><p>
    
    Like most pop bands with guitars, Sunday's Best are at their most affecting
    when the songs are trimmed of excess fat and drive the melody straight home.
    Opener ""The Try"" is nicely arranged, with several contrasting rhythmic feels,
    each of which appropriately support the lead material they're given.  Drummer
    Thomas Ackerman and co-producer Tony Lash (ex-Heatmiser, drummer for No. 2)
    keep the sound crisp and clear and are always sure to have Reyes' voice up
    front and center-- an important move, as his tenor is easily the most
    distinctive element within the band.</p><p>
    
    Ian Moreno's lead guitar parts play a nice second fiddle to the vocals
    throughout the album, never intruding on Reyes' space, but adding a little
    more interest to the backgrounds.  Yet, despite the musical subtleties
    present, it's a shame that the band hasn't made more attempts to broaden
    their overall sound, as the sonic uniformity of <i>The Californian</i> begins
    to wear as it progresses.  ""If We Had It Made,"" with its surprising, tasteful
    incorporation of bells into the arrangement, hints at something more expansive
    in the band's future.</p><p>
    
    If Reyes is the band's focal point, it certainly helps that his lyrics
    (co-written with Ackerman) aren't half bad.  The lightly rocking ""Our Left
    Coast Ambitions"" is one of the record's best tracks, featuring sarcastic
    calls of ""Hooray for Hollywood!"" and a lead guitar part with some unusual
    volume and crunch, while ""Beethoven St."" is straightforward and unapologetically
    nostalgic for the street Reyes grew up on.  Part of what makes ""Beethoven St.""
    work is that the feeling of nostalgia is conveyed through imagery, rather than
    through the whiny ""I wish things were the way they were""-isms that too many
    songwriters get bogged down with.</p><p>
    
    Sunday's Best stretches out the structure of the final song, ""Los Feliz Arms,""
    utilizing loud/soft dynamics and some guitar heroics likely left over from
    their early days, but keeping it reigned in enough that you don't forget
    it's a pop song.  But that, of course, is one of <i>The Californian</i>'s
    primary shortcomings: it's just a bit too polite.  I'm not advocating a
    feedback frenzy or a screaming fit on any of these songs, but the band could
    stand to be less afraid to let loose and step a bit outside of the
    ultra-comfortable pop trappings they're now calling home.</p><p>
    
    Between that and the overall single-hued feel of the album, it's hard to
    recommend this to just anybody, though fans of guitariffic indie pop should
    find it pretty easy to swallow.  <i>The Californian</i> is a fine, if inessential
    sophomore effort from a skilled band that could be on the cusp of something
    great if only they'd let their guard down.</p></div>"|7575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7575-the-californian/|6.4|Joe Tangari

Nope, he's not playing for me, as he clearly states on ""Let's Not
    Shit Ourselves (To Love and To Be Loved).""  Fair enough, because it shows.  If Oberst was really out to put
    smiles on the ears of his critics, the sound he's cultivated up through this, his third release, probably
    wouldn't be quite so constant.  By now, expecting Oberst to somehow gravitate away from his tortured
    tales of youthful angst and the perils of confiding yourself in another seems as hopeless as asking a
    dolphin to stop using echolocation.</p><p>
    
    Bright Eyes' jangly acoustic strumming and rise/fall vocal quaver has evolved fairly naturally since his
    1998 post-Commander Venus solo debut, <i>Letting Off the Happiness</i>.  So, then, would you be shocked to
    discover that <i>Lifted</i> is just about the least surprising album of all time?  It's true.  This record
    will happily provide you with <i>plenty</i> of opportunities to be unsurprised-- vocally, thematically, and
    in some cases musically.  Thankfully, it's all dramatically counterbalanced by some of the most unique
    arrangements Oberst has dreamt up yet.</p><p>
    
    The Bright Eyes orchestra lends its services to <i>Lifted</i>, pulling a string section and a few horns out
    of hock for atmosphere, and even recruiting some drunks for choir detail on ""Laura Laurent"" (there are some
    sober folks, too-- not just alkies).  When these orchestral elements take center stage, the effect is
    light-years removed and improved from any previous Bright Eyes offerings, though subdued enough to preserve
    the essential tone of past works, lest the sound be too disorienting.</p><p>
    
    The changes on <i>Lifted</i>-- beyond the aforementioned strings and horns-- are immediately recognizable.
    Somewhere along the way, Oberst has developed a much better ear for melody and left (most of) his shrieking
    tantrums by the wayside.  The tunes are often lighter, even playful at points; a far cry from prior heartsick
    ballads, some of which did little more than display his temper.  Of course, these backroom confessions are
    as intimate as ever, but the vibrant, slightly more lighthearted arrangements are a knowing wink of one
    bright eye as Oberst crows, ""I could tell you/ The truth like I used to/ And not be afraid of sounding fake/
    Now all anyone is listening for are/ The mistakes,"" on ""False Advertising.""  All the self-consciousness can
    become draining after a while, but the lion's share of this album consists of songs about his family and
    friends, and the musings of an artist second-guessing with the prospect of failure (and only 22 years old).</p><p>
    
    Love it or hate it, the precious, nasal vibrato Oberst affects is the tie that binds all these varied tunes
    together in the end, and in most cases, it compliments the music admirably.   It has its lows, of course,
    the most notable misstep being the nearly a capella ""The Big Picture,"" which stretches the limit of taste
    for seven full minutes.  Oberst falters often here, giving the illusion of greater emotional heft, although
    the track only really serves to underscore his vocal limitations.  <i>Lifted</i>'s other weak moments come
    with a few rarities heretofore consigned to the limbo of cyberspace.  ""Method Acting"" now comes complete
    with a backing chorus for the bridge, and ""Waste of Paint"" sounds to have been reworked a little, but
    they've been out in the sun too long.  Next to the fanged beauty of ""Lover I Don't Have to Love,"" these
    songs are undeniably faded.</p><p>
    
    But <i>Lifted</i> hits more than it misses.  The slow buildup of strings in the languid waltz of ""False
    Advertising"" is exceptional despite containing the album's most embarrassing moment (a contrived 'mistake'
    in the playing just as Oberst sings ""mistake""), though, as with the album as a whole, its accomplishments
    compensate for its oversights.  ""Bowl of Oranges"" features a delicate, continually shifting piano refrain
    and bittersweet swells of strings in the background.  ""So that is how I learned the lesson/ That everyone's
    alone/ And your eyes must do some raining/ If you're ever going to grow,"" is backed by major-to-minor shifts
    to compliment the subtle mix of emotions.</p><p>
    
    The slow burn of ""Don't Know When But a Day Is Gonna Come"" hangs like a thundercloud in Western skies as
    Oberst talks of men with silver guns and dying for his father's sins.  The cadence that unrolls and distant
    piano warbling sound like the first drops of rain that presage an eventual downpour, before the song finally
    breaks with a flood of strings and guitar.  It brings to mind some of the darker moments of The Man in Black
    himself, Johnny Cash, with all its murmurings of end-times prophecies and sober grit-- and that's just
    about as high a compliment as I could pay.  This track is definitely first among equals with the other great
    moments of <i>Lifted</i>.</p><p>
    
    The album wraps with ""Let's Not Shit Ourselves,"" a vaguely country-and-western tune that's all over the
    place, taking a vague stab at assessing the world's situation and how it relates to Oberst himself.  It's
    wildly pretentious, but the charming-- dare I say, <i>quaintness</i>-- of this record finally makes that an
    asset, especially on this sweeping closer.  He's wracked, maybe by necessity, and he's really starting to
    turn that to his advantage; the prosaic poetry of his work is genuinely compelling on this album, partly
    due to pretense, and partly to sincerity.  In the end, of course, I'm still somewhat disappointed that
    Oberst isn't catering to my personal expectations, but as long as he keeps marching toward broader musical
    horizons, I say more power to him.</p></div>"|937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/937-lifted-or-the-story-is-in-the-soil-keep-your-ear-to-the-ground/|7.7|Eric Carr

You know the
    stuff of which I speak; hip-hop built from samples harder to grasp than a wall of Jell-O, whose time
    signatures change faster than a 15 year-old girl's fashion sense, all strung around beats dirtier than
    the old man asleep at the bus stop.  Innovators like cLOUDDEAD, El-P, and the Anticon Crew have been
    redefining what hip-hop is for years now, so it's nice that people are finally starting to take notice. If
    you've been paying any attention, you know what's bound to happen next: the market will glut, and innovation
    will make way for imitation. But first, Dälek returns to the scene, fresh off collaborations with Faust,
    Techno Animal and Kid606, with a sophomore album inventive enough to extend avant-garde hip-hop's stay in
    the limelight for, at the very least, a few more weeks.</p><p>
    So what is it that makes Dälek-- alongside producer Oktopus, and turntablist/producer Still-- stand out
    amongst a seeming onslaught of original, challenging hip-hop?  Namely that their songs are set to moody
    musique concrète backdrops that sound like something out of a David Lynch nightmare. Yes, there are rhymes
    set to hand-drums and cowbells. Yes, the lyrical content would feel more at home in a lit hall than in some
    trash-ridden alley. Yes, there are times when Dälek opts to speak his vocals rather than rap them. And yes,
    he's more sensitive than your average bear.  But what really separates Dälek from the rest isn't his rabid
    experimentation as much as the way he builds a bridge between the avant-garde and the traditional.</p><p>
    While his contemporaries experiment with slant-rhyme and abstract poetics, Dälek takes a comparatively
    standard lyrical approach (assuming you'd consider rhymes like, ""Forgot our days in shackles?/ You
    concentrate on battles?/ I lecture graduates/ Discussing Kant till they leave baffled,"" standard), setting
    forcefully delivered rhymes to some of the strangest soundscapes that will ever be labeled 'hip-hop.' Pleas
    for understanding, cries of frustration, and even the occasional ray of hope weave in and out of music that
    owes more to 80s Western European industrial music a la Psychic TV and Nurse with Wound than it does to
    Grandmaster Flash or Public Enemy.</p><p>
    Steering clear of the purposefully vague poetic abstractions of his peers, Dälek prefers to revisit much of
    the thematic ground that hip-hop culture was built on. He's confused by issues of race (the album opens with
    a track called ""Spiritual Healing,"" which poses the question: ""Who you pray to, my God, the black God?/ Who
    you pray to, my God, the brown God?/ Who you pray to, my God, the white God?/ Your reaction's kind of odd
    for a kid who loves to nod""), frustrated by his confusion (""I vent my anger on all angles/ Would strangle
    angels if they'd let me""), yet certain all the while that the answers lie in the past, never ashamed to
    look to his predecessors for clues in his eternal quest for understanding (""Remember days of cardboard, fat
    lace, and Krylon?/ Microphones and twelves, tools we all relied on/ Niggas dropped a verse, the thought was
    one to die on/ I remember hip-hop, that's my Mt Zion"").</p><p>
    If Dälek's skill lies largely in his ability to merge the traditional with the unusual, then perhaps it's
    somewhat ironic that <i>From Filthy Tongue of Gods and Griots</i>' finest moment is its most atypical. A
    twelve-minute epic called ""Black Smoke Rises"" serves as the album's centerpiece, a defining moment that sees
    Dälek all but abandoning any and all rules of hip-hop. ""Black Smoke"" is all atonal drones, hisses and shrieks
    that build and build, computer bleeps that pierce the atmosphere like an alarm clock pierces through sleep,
    ghostly vocals that linger ominously on the horizon, coaxing the nervous listener to come closer. Throbbing
    Gristle is the closest reference point I can manage, with Dälek playing the role of Genesis P. Orridge,
    calmly intoning a mantra (""Black smoke rises to a heaven I do not know/ Slowly gaze to take in our sorrow"")
    that bobs peacefully in and out of the murky chaos. His words float through the listeners' consciousness,
    eventually overtaken by the building drones. The grinding noise escalates and Dälek plays the now-cliché
    part of the emotional emcee. But his introspective spoken words transcend the obvious. As he longs for a
    soul he once knew, the listener catches himself uncertain if Dälek's referring to a lover, a more innocent
    world, or himself.</p><p>
    Such ambiguity rears its head again on ""Trampled Brethren,"" built around a vocal sample that warns, ""So that
    we would be denied the knowledge of who we are, this was taken out of the history books several centuries
    ago.  And, of course, it hasn't been put back yet.""  Standard hip-hop fare, sure. But by placing it against
    a backdrop of Eastern Indian instrumentation, Dälek denies the surface interpretation, reminding listeners
    that injustice and oppression is something happening everywhere, to everyone.</p><p>
    ""Forever Close My Eyes"" is universal in a different way. Depressed, though never whiny, Dälek embeds a
    refrain of, ""My yesterdays don't matter now, they're gone/ Your careless expression left my wrists torn.../
    Yesterdays don't matter now, you're gone/ Shattered glass of empty bottles cut my palms,"" in a glorious bed
    of e-bowed guitar feedback a la Fripp &amp; Eno's <i>No Pussyfooting</i>.</p><p>
    As an emcee, Dälek shows off a rare versatility, equally capable of straight rhyming and formless spoken
    word.  As a poet, Dälek has a grasp on subtlety that most will never approach.  And as a collective, Dälek
    have achieved the seemingly impossible: successfully bridging the conventional and the experimental in a
    way that respects both at once.  It's a risky endeavor-- one that threatens to alienate fans of both
    disciplines.  But it's this very risk that makes Dälek's music so very affecting.</p></div>"|2148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2148-from-filthy-tongue-of-gods-and-griots/|8.7|David M. Pecoraro

For Alfie's second album,
    the former is the latter: you've got an illustration of a dog-eared old volume lying open, with the title
    printed on the left page and a painting of the band on the right.  The five Brits are sitting on a bench
    with a newspaper and a football, looking like right proper lads in their natty sweaters.  Fans of Coldplay
    and Travis rejoice-- we've come upon another charming trad-rock boy-band, right?  As if!  For Alfie are
    telling us that you can't judge a group by their lame-ass name or album title.</p><p>
    
    Instead, Alfie are a song-oriented rock band, and they shuffle effortlessly through a number of different
    styles.  ""Gee, I've never heard that description from a reviewer before!""  Shut it, you sad bastard.  As
    with all good pop, your reservations are lowered when you actually listen to the music.  The title track
    starts the album with acoustic picking and a soft, skiffling drumbeat.  Singer Lee Gorton lets down his
    defenses, singing that ""it's yours if you want it, no one's berating me/ Try not to be so afraid, it's your
    move.""  The interplay of piano and organ at the end makes for a warm, pleasant opener.  ""Cloudy Lemonade""
    gets more flirtatious with a funky percussion intro and lyrics about flowers and such.  A flautist fills
    out the song with a keen midsection, and the technicolor swoon of the guitars adds to the romance.</p><p>
    
    ""Don't groups of this sort usually have a charismatic lead singer?""  Well, how convenient that you're here,
    rhetorical question, because Lee Gorton does have an endearing presence.  That is, if you don't mind the
    slurry wash of vowels that he sings through his nose.  The nasal factor really isn't bad, and on the
    beautiful ""Rain, Heaven, Hell"" his slow drawl allows for a sensitive tone.  Of course, it also aids him in
    impressions, as on ""Bends for 72 Miles,"" named appropriately since it's an (unannounced) tribute to Radiohead's
    <i>The Bends</i>.  The sultry bass groove copies Colin Greenwood's very carefully, and Gorton adopts the
    same sneering Britpop sass that Thom Yorke was going for back in those heady mid-90s.</p><p>
    
    It's all forgivable, though, since it's done so well; it's ""The Reverse Midas Touch"" that threatens to turn
    it all to shit.  Gorton mumbles this cod-hip-hop introduction, like Fun Lovin' Criminals ripping off G. Love
    aping John Lee Hooker.  In case you missed that, it's white boys copping black blues, thrice-removed.  His
    affections are awful, but forgivable since it's just a bad page in an otherwise good book.  When Alfie stick
    with influences closer to home, they're quite convincing.  ""Halfway Home"" breezes through with muted trumpet
    swells, and Gorton's fey vocals remind me of Gorky's Zygotic Mynci.  Later on, ""Summer Lanes"" drops into an
    infectious, bouncy beat reminiscent of the Wedding Present.</p><p>
    
    There may be some skeptics out there for whom the cycle between shuffle-pop to indie rock is not the best
    example of 'eclecticism.'  Fear not, naysayers, for Alfie deviate even further from your expectations!  ""Not
    Half"" boasts a washboard-pluckin' New Orleans-style breakdown complete with a trombone, and as a swanky
    diversion it actually works.  ""Me and Mine"" plods through an interesting rhythmic lilt, punctuated by piano
    and what sounds like rusty pipes being scraped and glass bottles beaten.  Meanwhile, the closer, ""The Lighthouse
    Keeper,"" contains perhaps Alfie's best and worst impulses at once.  The band plays a gentle waltz, bolstered
    with brass accents.  The sweet pace doesn't do much to distract from Gorton's annoyingly whimsical vocals.
    But then he disarms you with the line, ""Tell me when you'll give me to the sea,"" and the other bandmembers
    begin echoing his lines, one measure behind each time, obscuring his words as if the waves were washing up
    against the rocks.</p><p>
    
    XL Recordings licensed <i>A Word in Your Ear</i> from Twisted Nerve, the label started by Andy Votel and the
    Badly Drawn Boy himself, Damon Gough.  As fitting for those two, Alfie's new album retains a slightly folky
    atmosphere despite the different stylistic arrangements, and a near-twee confidence that makes you want to
    stick up for the underdogs.  It may not have you dropping your Sarah Records vinyl off at the Salvation Army,
    but at 43 minutes it's a brief, satisfying read.  It does well to rip open the rain-soaked cardboard, as
    predicted by Father DiCrescenzo in his review of the band's previous EP collection, <i>If You Happy With You
    Need Do Nothing</i>.  I can only end this review with an endorsement: as albums go, it's better than a turd
    in your ear.</p></div>"|105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/105-a-word-in-your-ear/|7.2|Christopher Dare

    typify sonic experimenters of Phil Elvrum's caliber.  In fact, for a guy with a near-supernatural talent
    for manipulating recorded sound, Elvrum seems almost suspiciously good-natured. Even as his albums have
    progressively become more sonically complex and his songs more epic, he has remained an entirely accessible
    and likeable character.</p><p>
    
    As there's no contrived artifice of mystery or obscurity to the Microphones, it's not all that surprising
    that Elvrum has compiled the plethora of hard-to-find Microphones singles-- as well as some other non-album
    recordings-- onto this one, easy-to-swallow CD.  <i>Song Islands</i> compiles pretty much every non-album
    Microphones track in existence, aside from those that were included on last year's vinyl-only <i>Blood</i>
    LP. As such, the compilation is far more disparate than Elvrum's other recorded output, especially last
    year's stunningly consistent <i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i>.  In short, there are a few moments of absolute
    brilliance, a few stinkers, and a whole bunch of tracks that will be of great interest only to die-hards.</p><p>
<i>Song Islands</i>' first several tracks have an adventurous, though endlessly unrefined, lo-fi sound that
    typifies early Microphones recordings. The appropriately percussion-heavy ""Bass Drum Dream"" contains several
    sonic calling cards-- stereo-panned acoustic guitars and elephantine distorted drums. The lyrics are vivid
    and imaginative, detailing Elvrum's vision of a fantastical drum-oriented universe. ""The Storm"" is less
    successful, pairing overdriven marching band percussion with layers of indistinguishable distorted noise.
    ""Feedback,"" however, is one of <i>Song Islands</i>' most interesting tracks.  Opening with a sample of an
    retro-style announcer discussing drums that wouldn't seem displaced on DJ Shadow's <i>The Private Press</i>,
    the track soon becomes a sparse acoustic guitar-and-mumble dirge, and then a mess of blaring guitars and
    booming percussion.</p><p>
    
    As these songs were not assembled as an album, the more sonically overpowering tracks lose some of the punch
    they carried as part of a greater entity.  <i>Song Islands</i> is at its most successful when the more basic
    elements of songcraft are given precedence. An alternate version of ""The Moon,"" with a sparse, <i>Pink Moon</i>-style
    arrangement, is quite possibly the most beautiful single track ever to grace a Microphones album.  ""Deeply
    Buried"" is centered around a bass drum, a bell, and an utterly gorgeous vocal melody, and accentuated by
    flourishes of backwards percussion and guitar.  Like the best of Elvrum's work, it conveys a concurrent
    innocence and understanding that's capable of stripping your defenses like industrial-grade paint thinner.</p><p>
    
    Yet, sadly, there are parts of this album in which that innocence turns almost ridiculous-- most notably,
    the hokey sing-along ""I Can't Believe You Actually Died.""  Though the instrumentation and recording is
    typically top-notch, the song itself is cloying and sing-songy, entirely betraying the serious subject
    matter. And the fact that half the population of Olympia sings on the recording doesn't do much to counter
    the its awkwardness.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>Song Islands</i> doesn't stray far from what we've come to expect from Elvrum.  Given the
    fact that this is a compilation, it obviously doesn't come together all that well, and there's little here
    that can really compare to the best of <i>It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water</i> or <i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i>.
    Still, for fans, there's a lot to like here.  And thankfully, that goodness can now be tapped without having
    to sort through countless pieces of seven-inch vinyl.</p></div>"|5266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5266-song-islands/|7.2|Matt LeMay

It sticks out like a bare ass in the window of a passing school bus.
    While the band plays squeaky-clean garage rock, Appelgren hops and skips through the melody, arbitrarily
    shrieking one note and dragging another behind him like a rag doll.  His voice doesn't even sound integrated
    in the mix: it comes through so loud and clear, and so much more histrionic than the rest of the band, that
    you can picture him alone in an isolation booth, planning out how he'll maul each lyric.</p><p>
    
    Appelgren has plenty of tricks up his sleeve and a firm hold on his technique.  He's talked about using his
    voice as an instrument, which seems to mean that he wants to wheeze out as many sounds as possible: sneers,
    yelps, shrieks, moans, and drawn-out, pitch-bent tones of pure whining noise.  Dig the full-bore slide into
    meaningless lines like, ""Sunned things speak to me/ To the effect of free.""</p><p>
    
    But the casual listener won't judge Appelgren on what he can do so much as how it all sounds, and in the
    studio, his voice veers towards needy, overwrought, and a little immature.  At his day job, Appelgren is a
    sophisticated businessman who runs the Lookout! Records label; but on ""Breakfast,"" when he sings, ""Fix me
    breakfast,"" he sounds like your visiting nephew waking you up and demanding food.  The wailing on ""C'mon""
    places him at five years old, maybe six.  At other times he sounds like a teenager, and although rock caters
    to needy teens, how often do you actually want to listen to one?  No, Appelgren, you can't borrow the damn
    car tonight.  I don't care if Sally's easy.  And that's no way to talk about a girl.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, the band chugs along somewhat anonymously.  The Pattern's crack indie veterans include Jason
    Rosenberg of Saint James Infirmary and Andy Asp of Nuisance on guitars, bassist Carson Bell of The Cutz,
    and drummer Scott Batiste from Heart of Snow.  They rock hard, but they don't have much personality together--
    and it doesn't help to play straight-out garage-rock at a time when such records are pure commodities.</p><p>
    
    Even with only six songs on the disc, nothing they wrote stands out: they don't have any new hooks or riffs,
    the pace is rigid, and there's nothing you'll be humming on your way to work tomorrow morning. The material
    puts this album damn near the platonic ideal of the Pitchfork 5.0: not awful, but not great.  It only eeks
    above that because, whether or not you like Appelgren, there's never a dull moment when he's around.</p><p>
    
    Word on the street is that these guys give good gig, which landed them on tour this spring with the Mooney
    Suzuki and The Hives.  (Which is why they're getting notice now, and why we're reviewing this a year after
    it came out... we're whores to fashion, but at least we're honest.)   A lot of bands can't capture on record
    what they do to a crowd: they rock you all night but send you home with a disc you never end up playing.

First up, it's Avril
    Lavigne.  Next.  A crappy power ballad, the band ripping off both Whitesnake
    and Pearl Jam.  No.  Nelly's ""Hot in Herre.""  Now that's what I'm talkin'
    about!  Then that J-Lo song about girlfriends and boyfriends.  Great track, but
    the singing's not so hot.  After which comes four songs in a row that suck.
    The trouble with pop radio is that if you don't like the tunes, you're doomed.</p><p>
    
    At home, I can put on whatever I want.  Wallow in my own insular freakishness.
    First up, it's some neat Japanese sine-wave stuff.  Well, it's sort of neat,
    but 25 minutes in, I need a breather.  How about some classic Aphex?  Sure,
    this is pretty good, but not exactly the kind of thing that's gonna shake my
    house down.  Hmm, maybe I need something that shakes my house down.  I'll put
    on some... Can?  No.  What about Mouse on Mars?  Not really.  There's always
    Abba.  Come on, dude.  There has to be something intelligent here I can blast.
    Why can't someone just make a decent fusion of pop and IDM?</p><p>
    
    The answer's a little complicated.  Thing is, KWLD works when there's a good
    track, and if so, I'm usually singing along, bouncing in the car.  I figure
    this is because it's got a cool beat, cool production, cool vocal or all three,
    which makes it an instant classic.  And if I'm writing about it later, I'm even
    going deeper.  But that's a big 'if'.  I doubt Universal Records cares what I
    think about during Nelly's tune as long as I'm buying the album (which I didn't--
    radio free everything, bigwigs).  And in fairness to Nelly, I actually do go
    deeper than just bouncing in the car when his song comes on (ever like to listen
    to see if you can pick out what instruments are doing what in songs?  Do you want
    to be my music buddy?), but if I and 100,000 of my closest friends don't run out
    and purchase the album, K-Wild's gonna take it off the air fast.  And I don't
    want that.  I want a party.</p><p>
    
    IDM and experimental electronic is different.  The feeling here is more of
    an extended consideration, even for the most 'entertaining' stuff in the
    family.  We all know and love <i>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</i>, but think
    back and see if your record is completely clear of all chin-scratching and/or
    getting high and talking about how ""infinitely spacious, yet mathematically
    efficient, yet blissfully... oh, what's the word"" it is.  And then consider the
    realms of analysis breached upon each playing of records by Oval, Autechre or
    anything featuring Jim O'Rourke (and really, should we be dissecting Stereolab
    records?).  Whether there really is a unifying characteristic among all of the
    music classified as IDM has been debated.  And I'm not sure, but I can't think
    of any relatively popular music that so consistently receives props of the
    intellectual nature (and non-props of the obsessively analytical persuasion).</p><p>
    
    From the sound of <i>Here and You</i>, Tatsuya Oe (a.k.a. Captain Funk, a.k.a.
    just Oe) means to bridge the gap between KWLD and Warp.  Oe burst upon the
    Japanese techno scene in the late 90s, as Captain Funk, with his record
    <i>Bustin' Loose</i> (step back now-- would you have bought a record by Captain
    Funk called <i>Bustin' Loose</i>?).  Unfortunate names and titles aside, it was
    fairly popular and Oe still has a pretty good rep as a DJ.  But since then, he's
    gradually moved outside the pure electronica realm into poppier territory.  His
    previous release, <i>Songs of the Siren</i>, emphasized traditional song structures
    while maintaining the beat tactics and head-cocking production so common in dance
    music.  <i>Here and You</i> follows his blueprint.</p><p>
    
    Now, the question remains: why can't anyone make a good fusion of pop and IDM?
    Oe shows me why it's not nearly as simple as it might seem.  ""The Glow"" opens
    with a panned acoustic guitar and lead vocoder-vocal (and as a side-note to all
    artists not named Daft Punk, quit using this.  And to Daft Punk, think about not
    using this next time).  When the beat comes in over the newly harmonized vocal,
    the mood immediately goes from minimalist future-pop to Chemical Brothers-style
    big beat.  Pretty soon, multiple new guitar lines enter, and Oe introduces any
    number of tricky polyrhythmic ornaments.  It's a neat little piece, even if the
    beats are a tad on the 1997 side.  Similarly, ""Rambler and Canter"" has a very
    hummable melody line (courtesy of Oe's whistling), and some light polyrhythm
    borrowed from the first tune (think Philip Glass scoring an Evian ad).  It's
    a nice tune, and the extended tic-tack bridge into ""Time Has Told Me"" is
    almost art-house cool enough for Mille Plateaux.</p><p>
<i>Here and You</i> works least when it seems to sacrifice those neat production
    tricks for the hummable melodies.  ""Unexamined Sam"" brings back the vocoder way
    too soon, and unfortunately doesn't feature a beat big enough to hide the thin
    gag.  The simple melody, really nothing more than the electronically harmonized
    vocalizations of Oe and his machinery, isn't enough to carry the limp beat.  So
    the song falls short of something you would dance to, or with which you might
    sing along.  Against all odds, Oe brings back the speak-and-spell vocoder vocals
    for ""Dismissed.""  The tune itself seems like homage to <i>Dots and Loops</i>-styled
    space-pop, though someone should tell Oe that Laetitia Sadier doesn't use a vocoder--
    that's just how she sings.</p><p>
    
    Parts of this record should be left open for further research.  First, there
    is the electro-drone (Daft-Gaze?) of ""Hollow Stone.""  The opening wall of
    guitar-driven feedback and meandering melody exist in perfect symbiosis, and
    the peaceful exit music of ""Sleep Will Come"" is just minimal enough to
    qualify as futuristic, while still retaining lounge-y romanticism.  Oe has
    fashioned an album full of melodies (however obscured by production they may
    be), yet with precious little to back them up.  The production is good (and,
    important for bringing out those melodies, never gets overly complicated),
    but there's something missing in the mix that would turn <i>Here and You</i>
    into a viscerally engaging record.  As it stands, the jury is still out on
    whether you can really fuse pop and new electronic music.</p></div>"|5948.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5948-here-and-you/|5.5|Dominique Leone

I, too, experienced a peculiar sense of
    déjà vu upon first viewing the white promo sleeve emblazoned with ""Tender Trap"" and the K logo. You figure
    someone's banking on the confusion of the record buying market, much like the once-clever (now unemployed)
    Internet pioneers who correctly questioned our collective spelling ability and bought up such choice domain
    names as Amazone.com and Salan.com. (A point clearly discovered by all too hasty Pitchfork readers who
    forget the ""media"" suffix and find themselves encouraged to buy livestock. Accident? I don't think so).</p><p>
    For clarification purposes, Tender Trap's relationship to Tiger Trap is merely coincidental but they will
    likely appeal to the same audience: a largely (though I don't mean to invoke stereotypes) female fanbase
    whose taste runs toward short, jangly, dreamy, twee-influenced indie pop. Tsunami's Jenny Toomey once
    asserted that ""punk means cuddle,"" but it took Heavenly's ""PUNK Girl"" to make me believe it.  The warmest
    and fuzziest of all bands ever (even if inappropriately) associated with girls and their oft-cited ability
    to kick ass, Heavenly could hypothetically sing about the bloody aftermath of nuclear apocalypse and conjure
    visions of fluffy puppies and charming, precocious children frolicking in grassy wonderlands.  Hence, they
    inspired legions of doe-eyed twee bands worldwide.  With the suicide of Heavenly's Matthew Fletcher, the
    rest of the band, led by Amelia Fletcher, changed their name to Marine Research, fleshed out their angelic
    pop and released the lush, <i>Sounds from the Gulf Stream</i>.</p><p>
    And now, after the recent departure of keyboardist Cathy Rogers and guitarist Peter Momtchiloff, the
    remaining Heavenly Researchers have regrouped as Tender Trap.  The band has spent the last two years writing
    and recording this album of eclectic, though no less ethereal, pop songs, the vast majority of which hover
    around a two-minute length.  And while nothing on <i>Film Molecules</i> is exactly unexpected or newly
    innovative, Tender Trap is a remarkably clean, cohesive, entertaining proposition.</p><p>
    The opener, ""Fin,"" builds out of an electronic pulse and resolves into a sort of featherweight shoegazer,
    the arrangement of which serves as a terrific showcase for Fletcher's breathy vocals. This is followed
    abruptly by the upbeat, jangle pop of ""Oh, Katrina,"" which, with its pitch-perfect harmonies and quick
    tempo, more closely recalls Heavenly than anything else on the album.</p><p>
    Fletcher's candy coated melodies provide a clever juxtaposition to the implied message of her lyrics,
    evidenced in the bouncy ""That Girl,"" which documents the travails of burgeoning teenage feminist whose
    ""record collection separates women from men,"" and namechecks Le Tigre. Likewise, the Blondie-influenced
    ""Face of 73,"" offers a subtle critique of media superficiality without veering a single step outside the
    retro dance-pop formula-- even Fletcher's droll vocals are dead-on.</p><p>
    The super-abbreviated ""Dispraxic,"" with its stripped down metal-tinged guitar and the excellent new wave
    flavored ""Chemical Reaction,"" provide Fletcher with the opportunity to rant without the ironic distance,
    and the evocative ""Talk in Song"" is an oddly dark, fractured torch song that single-handedly keeps me from
    issuing a pejorative comment about the slow songs on <i>Film Molecules</i>.  That being said, the overwrought
    melodrama of ""Emma"" sounds like filler, and the minimal ""Brown Eyes"" only shows the unflattering limitations
    of Fletcher's vocal abilities.</p><p>
    I imagine it's difficult to pull off this kind of music without causing sweet-induced listener aneurysms
    and/or counting so singularly on the affectation that you lose all substance-- but the Heavenly/Marine
    Research/Tender Trap gang has continually represented one of the better and more sophisticated models of
    the genre.  And on the whole, <i>Film Molecules</i> is no exception.  It may be unlikely to win fans from
    audiences with allergies to saccharine, but that's not really the point, is it?</p></div>"|7971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7971-film-molecules/|7.5|Alison Fields

    can you do?  As obvious as the reference seems, he doesn't give me much choice.
    Not that Ruth's music really <i>sounds</i> like the work of Kev Shields, but
    the aesthetic used to construct the songs is remarkably close to the one that
    created <i>Loveless</i>.</p><p>
    
    See, Ruth's basic approach on <i>Whatever It Means</i> seems to be to start with
    a simple vocal melody, and then layer sheets of controlled guitar noise on top,
    creating an intensely dense yet penetrable texture.  This concentrated squall is
    propelled by programmed beats that just might be somewhat danceable if they
    weren't carrying the weight of such a deep roar.  Ruth deviates from this formula
    as the album reaches its midpoint, lifting the fog for some more directly accessible
    numbers, but for the first few tracks, this is what we get.  And it's a wonderful
    thing.</p><p>
    
    The third time I listened to <i>Whatever It Meant</i>, I remember distinctly saying
    out loud, to an empty room, ""Man, this album is fucking <i>weird</i>.""  What I hadn't
    yet realized was how insidiously memorable it is.  The more I listen to it, the deeper
    it buries itself in my mind, taking hold of a different cerebral region with each spin.</p><p>
    
    The first four songs pour from the speakers like digital molasses.  ""End Up,"" for
    example, sounds like it wanted to be a normal song at one point, but the vocals and
    trotting percussion wind up trees in a forest of sound.  ""How Truly Great You Are""
    is a drumless, eerie thicket of guitar and quietly soulful singing.  Lyrically, it's
    an excellent, sarcastic devotional to a gigantic ego and all the people that bow to
    it; musically, it's a subtle and imaginative offering that neatly toes the line between
    ambient comfort and pop accessibility.</p><p>
<i>Whatever It Meant</i> reaches a sort of turning point after that song, moving several
    lateral steps into some sort of cabaret for the clinically depressed with ""Oversimplifying.""
    ""Lots of newfound free time I have/ Oughta teach a course in being sad/ And the
    clouds that hover overhead get taken for granted,"" sings Ruth over not much more than
    a bass and some strategically placed effects.</p><p>
    
    ""To Forget"" and ""Kindly"" reverse the mixing principles of the first four songs, sweeping
    the noise-addled guitar parts behind the vocals and allowing the mixture of drum machine
    grooves and live percussion to flow more freely.  ""Kindly"" almost reminds me of some of
    Porcupine Tree's best material, with its understated vocals and creeping arrangement.
    Ruth sits down at the piano for ""Every Summer,"" which is about as straightforward as
    pop music gets: singer and accompaniment, with some soft-toned synth countermelodies
    and xylophone to spruce up the edges.</p><p>
    
    The album's final third dives back into noisy territory, though it feels somewhat removed
    from the first four tracks during which the guitars are frequently so overdriven that the
    strumming and harmony becomes somewhat ambiguous.  ""Code Words"" is almost reminiscent of
    the shoegazer punk of <i>Italian Flag</i>-era Prolapse, minus the male/female vocal attack
    of that band.  The transition is smooth, though, as Ruth seems to have had sequencing in
    mind when making the album.  The song opens with a very odd repeated piano phrase that
    immediately throws you off the trail of whatever key the song might be in, something that's
    not aided by the distorted everything that comes in shortly afterward.</p><p>
    
    ""Thanks Just the Same"" is a gorgeous ballad filled with floating piano figures, dejected
    vocals, and yep, tons more distortion.  The guitar loses prominence as the song progresses,
    setting up the off-kilter ""Nothing Can Make Me Feel Better,"" which opens relatively clean
    over some drunken piano before the static undertow and frantically busy drum program cut in.
    The album closes with ""It's Been Worth the Wait,"" and you're likely to agree, because it's
    the most majestic track on the album, weaving synth and distorted guitar (of course) into a
    quilt of pure sound and bringing the album full circle to the sound that opens it.</p><p>
    
    One thing I love to do with records that feel this complete is try to divide them into
    logical, equal sections, and I find that it's usually possible on some level.  <i>Whatever
    It Meant</i> follows what I've found to be a broad trend of breaking works into thirds to
    make them more digestible.  You've got the noisy/melodic first-third, the relatively clean,
    more sonically varied second-third, and the noisy/melodic/this-time-with-piano final third,
    complete with a nod back to the beginning at the end.  It sounds simple, but it's this kind
    of logical flow that makes this album a breeze to listen to, despite its often challenging
    mix.</p><p>
<i>Whatever It Meant</i> is an intriguing solo debut for an artist who's obviously not afraid
    to try something different.  Aside from his sonic adventurousness, though, he's also got an
    innate pop sense to balance it with, and that's what really makes it work.  This album is a
    world of sound, and it's got the hooks to drag you right into it.  Give it a try.</p></div>"|6881.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6881-whatever-it-meant/|7.8|Joe Tangari

To the rest of the world, they
    were the noir-fed band with the smoky baritone sax and massive bass that leant mood to TV crime shows and
    that movie about the guy who sleeps with his mom.  They had a couple of minor hits, but were always known
    more for their sound than their singles-- Mark Sandman's basso profundo and rumbling two-string bass guitar
    over Dana Colley's reeds and the coolly tense drumming of Billy Conway.</p><p>
    
    Sandman died unexpectedly on stage of a heart attack in 1999, and he's still an important figure here.  The
    city of Cambridge even dedicated a square to him next to the rock clubs-- a stunning, and let's face it,
    bizarre honor.  His bandmates also kept up his legacy, first with the Orchestra Morphine project which
    revived their material, and now with Twinemen.</p><p>
    
    This new band isn't trapped in the shadow of Morphine; they embrace it, doing everything but wearing Sandman's
    black shirts and donning his sunglasses.  The cover art of their debut uses his cartoon drawings, which he
    called ""twinemen,"" and they recorded the album in Morphine's Hi-N-Dry studio.  Husky-voiced singer Laurie
    Sargent has a rough tone that sinks to the level of her sidemen, lending these songs similar arrangements
    to the ones she gave Orchestra Morphine: drums, sax, vocals, and some 'low guitar.'  It's the same moody,
    lead-guitar-free sound Morphine had mastered.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there are also many changes, and the biggest is Sargent.  She leans seductively on the line
    between raunchy and sexy, with lyrics about ""fucking all day,"" or her ""chose sauvage"" (that's ""wild thing""
    in English).  She takes charge instantly with the opener, ""Spinner,"" a catchy tune with the kind of
    deep-plowing chorus we'd been missing post-Morphine; the guest musicians on keys and bass fill out the
    sound around the raw meat of Colley's sax.  But on the next tune, ""Little by Little,"" they slow down the
    tempo, strip down the music, and just let Sargent work the mic.  Conway ever so lightly plucks on a guitar
    while Sargent lays down a sultry, lounge-like mood, sounding looser and more expressively sexy than on the
    louder tracks.</p><p>
    
    There's just one problem: beneath the atmosphere, Twinemen don't have the songs.  After three strong tracks
    there's a run of tunes that simply lack any hooks or strong choruses.  ""Watch You Fall"" and ""Learn to Fly""
    feel like sketches, and ""Harper and the Midget"" only edges above those because of its freak storyline.
    The band throws some guitars on ""Ronnie Johnson,"" but Sargent's desperate vocals make the song; after that,
    ""Who's Gonna Sing"" wraps the album with a slim and pretty tune, Conway taking the vocals, as Colley does on
    a few other tracks.  Conway, though, sounds far less like Mark Sandman than Colley does on ""Golden Hour""--
    maybe it's the irony-free tone in his voice.</p><p>
    
    It's unfair to compare Twinemen to Morphine again and again, but they invite it: they can't let go of that
    slim palette, that black-and-white mood.  But at least they're expanding it.  Every track shows a new
    direction they could take, new sounds to play with, and emotions that go beyond the snarky, articulate cool
    we've already heard from them.  And who knows, if they fine-tune the writing, Twinemen could become the band
    that Morphine needed to grow into.</p></div>"|8219.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8219-twinemen/|6.4|Chris Dahlen

    known as music."" I guess that's one way of describing their sound. Another would be to say that this is
    easily the worst hip-hop album I've ever heard.  If Boom Box 2000's goal was to make an album so horrible
    that it exposed post-millennial hip-hop as a vapid, disposable art form, they should at least take comfort
    in achieving the first half of their goal.  On the songs that have raps, which are fortunately only a few,
    their lyrics are weak and completely out of sync with one another.  Their production sounds as if it was
    created with a $10 Pic n' Save Casio after a week-long nitrous oxide binge.</p><p>
    Unless you're the type that likes to slow down and laugh when you see a fatal car accident, there is
    absolutely nothing redeeming about this album.  The ""put-two-culturally-naïve-Asian-kids-in-a-room-and-let-them-make-a-hip-hop-album""
    concept is needless at best. At worst, it displays a racist undercurrent that belittles the considerable
    accomplishments of Asians in hip-hop and is comparable to the blackface comedy of the early 20th century.
    The fact that this was released by an indie-rock label that has never even dabbled in hip-hop before makes
    it all the more offensive and irritating.  If you can imagine Def Jam contracting Trick Daddy and Ol' Dirty
    Bastard to record an emo album where they whined about their trust funds and little white dicks, then perhaps
    you can understand just how unlistenable and tasteless this mess is.</p><p>
    And amazingly, the product is just as bad as the concept.  ""Boom Box 2000,"" which is the album's first song,
    comes closest to actually approximating hip-hop. With its over-the-top string sample and repetition of, ""Boom
    Box... Boom Box,"" rightfully skewers hip-hop's self-aggrandizing streak.  But the criticism is strictly
    superficial, and is delivered in such an intentionally horrible manner that it loses any of the power or
    humor it might have harbored.  On ""Drunk and High"" they also delve into a subject that's ripe for scrutiny
    (i.e. the glorification of drugs and alcohol in hip-hop), but as they scream, ""Get drunk and high,"" you find
    yourselves digging into the couch cushions in search of that elusive crack rock to put you out of your misery.</p><p>
    There are a few bright spots to be found. Clocking in at three seconds, ""Treats"" is the best song on the
    album by a long shot.  While ""Taste Buds,"" which stretches a full 20 seconds, comes in a close second.  The
    only vaguely witty lyric on the entire album is during ""Girls We Like"" when one of them (maybe) mocks Eminem's
    homophobia, singing, ""I once knew I girl I used to like, until she punched me in the dick.../ I called her a
    faggot 'cause I thought it meant jerk.""   The whole album clocks in at a little less than 24 minutes, and
    I'd like to believe that Boom Box became so disgusted with themselves that they abandoned the project before
    they did any further damage.</p><p>
    It's a shame this album was so godawful.  With everything from the absurdity of the commercial studio gangsta
    to the relentless and sometimes pointless ""independent as fuck"" posturing of underground emcees, hip-hop is a
    giant target for satirical spanking.  While <i>Boom Box</i> does have some of the subjects right, they're so
    painfully devoid of talent, and have such little understanding of the culture they're mocking, that their
    satire falls utterly flat.  If you want a good laugh at hip-hop's expense, rent <i>Fear of a Black Hat</i> or
    <i>CB4</i>, but whatever you do, don't get fooled by this bullshit.</p></div>"|862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/862-boom-box-2000/|2.4|Sam Chennault

    that easily justifies the thousands of nerdy pilgrimages it inspires. It seems that the concentrated ambience
    even strikes a few ne'er-to-do politicians as profound, because every year local legislature imposes a
    city-wide moratorium on driving with your windows rolled up. This, in effect, turns your stereo selections
    into high decibel calls for potential friends and mates and also exposes that cute blonde in the next lane
    for the Shawn Mullins fan she really is. That said, it's also worth noting that pretending your six o'clock
    traffic jam is really a Wayne Coyne-directed parking lot experiment really helps to pass the time.</p><p>
    
    Seeing as the ratio of P.R. representatives-to-actual fans is a good 9-to-1, it's no surprise that each
    coming year charts new levels of frenzied hype. Some of the press releases range from moronic (""They Might
    Be Giants MIGHT BE ready for an Underground Renaissance"") to silly (""The Shins: What Johnny Rotten would
    sound like if he went emo"") to stuff warranting an A&amp;R; exorcism (""With her latest offering, Abra Moore
    clearly defines herself as the next Radiohead""). This year, I wanted to forego all of that and subject
    myself to the brutal punishment of Japan's Acid Mothers Temple. I wanted to grasp Makoto Kawabata's extended
    hand as he took me on a tour of our pulsing ultra-violet universe, replete with its space coyotes and
    floating dojos. Where did I end up? Back in 1997, trying to reidentify with Scott McCloud and convincing my
    dyslexic friend Jake, who had read GVSB's acronym on the club's marquee, that Rob Pollard wasn't going
    to be making any appearances. Seriously, the whole network's gonna go down. Hey, have you seen <i>Hackers</i>?</p><p>
    
    Suffice to say, Girls Against Boys were cooler when their music seemed a dangerous cocktail of post-punk and
    pre-millenial tension.  Regardless of whether <i>You Can't Fight What You Can't See</i> is a return to form
    (which, in all respects, it is), it's hard to argue that the great alternative-industrial rock irony of
    'chronicling-the-evils-of-technology-by-means-of-utilizing-technology' didn't go the way of the Tamagotchi
    and that ""21st Century Digital Boy"" song.</p><p>
    
    Operating on the premise that, with the exception of 1998's Geffen calamity <i>Freak*On*Ica</i>, Girls
    Against Boys haven't drastically changed their formula since their 1989 debut <i>Tropic of Scorpio</i>,
    it's safe to say that the band knows their sound inside-and-out.  And what you've heard is all true:
    <i>You Can't Fight What You Can't See</i> cans the discotheque disaster and returns the guys to their
    original sound.  A wise decision undoubtedly, but it seems now that the band is terrified of change,
    leaving them to rehash what their first five albums accomplished in lieu of actual progression.  And as
    anyone could tell you, if there's something Girls Against Boys need now more than ever, it's to change
    <i>anything</i>. See, they had the right intentions with <i>Freak*On*Ica</i>, they just went about it
    all wrong.  And now, post-backlash, they're not going about it at all.</p><p>
    
    The style is unmistakably dated now, and the 'grooves' constructed throughout <i>You Can't Fight What You
    Can't See</i> attempt only to reinstill the same hedonistic impetus as on their oversexed 1996 release
    <i>House of GVSB</i>.  Never mind that the group has already successfully approximated that sound, as
    documented on that album's ""Disco Six Six Six"" (not to mention <i>Cruise Yourself</i>'s ""The Royal Lowdown"").
    But, while GvsB has always distinguished themselves from the crowds of would-be sonic revolutionaries crying
    ""MOLOCH!"" by lyrically excluding all listeners not affiliated with the rave scene, here the band manages to
    break new lows for ecstacy-tinged, Underworld-inspired speak/sing rants: ""I keep pushing/ Pushing in like
    an obsession/ Like an addiction/ Keep pushing...""</p><p>
    
    Of course, <i>You Can't Fight What You Can't See</i>, like most albums, does have a few spare moments of
    seemingly inspired performance.  ""All the Rage,"" despite its standard piss-poor lyrical content, ranks
    amongst the better songs on their last three albums, and ""Kicking the Lights"" finds the band experimenting
    with texture moreso than ever before.  The rest?  Just flip back through their catalog and imagine what
    those songs would sound like with crisper production and less inspiration.  Indeed, there's not much here
    to love, which just leaves one to wonder if history will remember any of Girls Against Boys' records beyond
    1994's <i>Venus Luxure No. 1 Baby</i>.  God knows I won't.</p></div>"|3457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3457-you-cant-fight-what-you-cant-see/|5.5|Kevin Adickes

Folks are constantly subjected to the
    infantilizing peekaboo juxtapositions of advertisements (hot, the designer handbag covers her boobs!), the
    choreographed passion and streamlined intercourse of film and TV (shucks, it all sort of falls into place
    if you buy silk sheets!), the vapid posturing and exaggerations of radio (you're the one I love forever
    which makes everything in this horrible world alright and, hey, plus, do me!). I know it's in our programming,
    but I had this flimsy theory that the mega-pull of loin-worship might be made more subtle if sex wasn't
    presented as a balletic panacea.  We might not have to witness such heartbreaking sights as: the desperation
    conveyed in the epidemic of people donning hoochie-wear to check the mail, old men overfilming their niece's
    birthday parties, or overweight Christians glaring passively at the disingenuous porn of reality TV.</p><p>
    
    Was a time I'd implicate Cinerama's David Gedge in the conspiracy to keep us drool-dangling and hump-hoping
    via vagueness and broad strokes.  During his stint as the leader of criminally unsung polish-rockers The
    Wedding Present, and on his last two albums fronting Cinerama, he's been quite the advocate of the booty =
    bliss equation, give or take the occasional nod to the pain of longing or the opportunity cost of a breakup.
    But on <i>Torino</i>, Cinerama's blaringest and best release, Gedge yanks off the soft-focus lens and offers
    sexual specifics. This honesty should be a balm for anyone traumatized by less-than-paradisiacal romance
    with actual consequences: wait, you mean lust can be detrimentally consuming? People's parts can intrudingly
    misalign? Menstruation's real? The side effects of hay-rolling might include cretinous jealousy? Birds can
    still shit on you out by the pool, even if you're mid-cuddle? Then why don't car alarms go off outside the
    conjugal windows in Meg Ryan movies?</p><p>
    
    Alas, prolonged exposure to le nittre grittre didn't save Gedge from his addiction. In the course of
    compiling all of his detailed research, he has become his subject's hostage. Wasn't it Nietzsche who said
    that if you stare too long at genitals, they also stare back into you? Thankfully, Gedge's habit doesn't
    prevent him from concocting a stellar, if somewhat single-minded, album.  The lyrics will reduce you to
    thinking the cover art is not just dangerously close to Kent's <i>Isola</i>, but that it's some sort of
    nipply, or priapic, or orgasmic visual suggestion.</p><p>
    
    ""And When She Was Bad"" kicks the album off with the query, ""If he's only a nobody, then why does he stare
    at your breasts?"" The equally noncircuitous but kinkier ""Two Girls"" (as in ""at the same time"") is about
    someone who-- and this is a sampling of Gedge's words-- chokes, provokes, eats, defeats, charms, harms,
    fights, delights, bites, excites, annoys, destroys, mocks, shocks, hates, and devastates him.  ""Estrella""
    deals with punishing a mate, via sleaziness and ""slight adultery,"" into breaking up with him. ""Cat Girl
    Tights"" involves cat girl tights. The violins and <i>Bona Drag</i>ness of the brief ""Airborne"" provide a
    moment of emotional release, but oh snap-- it was just a segue to ""Quick, Before It Melts"" which never
    leaves the smutgutter after this opening: ""When you said I've got nothing on beneath this dress, that was
    such good flirting/ I usually find such candidness disconcerting."" Sure you do; the next line, she adds:
    ""I don't wear underwear because it leaves a stripe.""</p><p>
    
    Amid these initial one-night standings, you'll notice that into the clean and lush Cinerama mix of strings,
    horns, harpsichords, flutes, fifes, and keyboards, a fair amount of actual rock chops has been added. These
    amendments aren't entirely mannered; rather than introduce themselves by saying, ""Hello, my name is Raaah
    and I'll be your guitar blast today,"" these abrupt bursts-- sometimes craftily preceded by a teensy
    xylophone bridge-- will send you diving for the volume knob. And don't commit the O'Rourke Fallacy and
    attribute the stomping, turbulent riffage to Monsieur Albini's presence-- he's been working with Gedge
    since the late 80s. Anyhow, the Albini on deck here is a different, more attentive one than the Corky
    O'Whamkaboom persona he's generated of late. Underproducing overproduction, he captures the elegant noise
    here as deftly as he drew Will Oldham out of his warble on <i>Viva Last Blues</i>.</p><p>
    
    ""Tie Me Up"" is an almost impolitic celebration of being owned and enslaved, complete with an overdone
    dead-stop at which Gedge whispers, ""I'll do it,"" and a symphonic crescendo at which he yells, ""I cried your
    name and then I came.""  By the time the song is over, you might be plugging your ears and defensively humming
    Weezer's ""Tired of Sex,"" or at least shouting, ""I get it, already.""  But you've still got to survive the
    catchy, clavier-seasoned ""Close Up"" whose speaker demands to be slowly told and retold about his partner's
    affair, the bras being undone, the ""touching you there,"" the ""making you come."" And you'll feel used by the
    opening couplet of ""Starry Eyed"": ""Why have you locked the bathroom door/ It's not as if I haven't seen you
    piss a thousand times before."" You know you're in love when a grueling lifetime of toilet-shyness dissipates
    into team spirit.</p><p>
    
    If any of those excerpts triggered a blush, a tee-hee, a ""don't go there!"" a ""too much information!"" or
    ""damn, that's raunchier than N.E.R.D.!"" then memorize this fun fact: writer Marcel Proust got off on cursing
    at, and spitting on, photographs of his mother. So you watch who you're calling perverse. Besides, Gedge
    doesn't leave you worrying about how he manages to stumble to the loo in the morning with his, apparently
    daily, sore sex-ankles. There's plenty else to appreciate on <i>Torino</i>. Gedge's game-to-grating fey
    factor prevents him from ever coming across like a salacious neighbor or bombastic Seducifer. The <i>Southpaw
    Grammar</i> guitar and whirlwind sound effect of ""Starry Eyed"" continues to acknowledge the Moz in the
    tradition of Cinerama's cover of the Smiths' ""London.""</p><p>
    
    Throughout the album gongs, bells, and chimes sneak
    in. Sally Murrell's once-frequent call-and-response backing vocals are now just bops and ahh's sprinkled on
    like pepper; you might think someone behind you in the room joined the show for a second. There's a surfy
    track, and forgone-conclusion spaghetti western touches. Huge slices of French cheese are processed with
    reverent seriousness.  And right when the bed-centric melodrama approaches artlessness and unbearability, the
    album is interrupted with a snippet of studio banter that reminds the listener of the pedestrian aspects of
    preparing a disc about peach juice running down the face of the girl with whom the speaker just made love by
    the lake: the bandmembers call headphones ""cans"" and laughingly tell Albini that they need to hear that last
    twenty seconds again, fearing that they got ""carried away"" and flubbed the music.</p><p>
    
    Justify the rating, you ask? What elevated this CD beyond its first-listen glass ceiling of merely sufficing
    7.8dom?</p><p>
    
    A: Timing. The conscious throwback of Britpop's stately rumble sounds tremendous after long spells with
    hardscrabble Americana and labor-intensive Experimentia. Anyone who ever Morrissey-twirled a hosepipe on
    their provider's patio as a combustible teen will welcome this effort. Gedge seems oblivious to the fact
    that all the gushing critics and cliquey consumers are crowding the 60s, 70s, and 80s lounges, leaving him
    to hog the stage in the remember-the-90s room.</p><p>
    
    B: Legacy fulfillment. How can he still have this much energy? What were you doing in 1989? I was trying to
    rig up a homemade Flavor Flav clocklace. Gedge was covering a obscure band named Pavement. Something about a
    box elder or something.</p><p>
    
    C: ""Health and Efficiency."" What a pop closer. The song begins and ends with sadly swooning chords played
    over what I assume is a 'field recording' that runs counter to the entire album's oh-hi-there pose. City
    noise, squeaking brakes, and the beeps of a truck in reverse can be heard, along with conversation that
    includes a man holding forth about 78s, Motown, his kids, and how ""we've become a very cold society."" The
    drums perfectly, lazily conceal the epic wail of distortion that arrives later, accompanied by a nervy,
    trilly violin. The lyrics finally fess up to regret and loss, and the listener is saved by one warmly
    reverbed note that ends the song right before you've closed the garage on your monoxide party.</p></div>"|1471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1471-torino/|8.0|William Bowers

    That was at least truthful.  Our Hero sighed and watched bleary-eyed as the cursor annihilated one of the
    most inane leads he had ever felt compelled to commit to the page.  Of course, it probably didn't help that
    he also felt compelled to write only while hammered on Diet Captain Cokes, but the way he saw it, Hemmingway
    was a great writer, and alcohol had solved all of <i>his</i> problems (except for that last one, but whatever).</p><p>
    
    Sitting imprisoned at the computer keyboard, Our Hero was all out of options.  He had already married all
    the pens and pencils in his desk drawer (they had been living in sin for years-- it was for the best), and
    fogging his glasses with compressed air had begun to lose its K-thru-6 charm.  Plus, he was out of canned
    air.  No, the truth of the matter loomed as large a litigant in the class-action suit against the
    grease-peddlers of America: he had to find some way to write about the debut EP from the Canadian foursome
    Hot Hot Heat.  He needed to buy some time-- it was time to listen to the CD again, but that would only get
    him sixteen minutes, so he needed to think faster than he had ever thought before.</p><p>
    
    Momentarily blinded by the hot hot pink <i>Knock Knock Knock</i>, he placed the disc into his Hello Kitty! CD
    player, and waited to be inspired.  Instead, all he got from the opening track, ""Le Le Low,"" was Steve Bays'
    voice reminding him why he'd started drinking to write this review in the first place.  Normally, Our Hero
    would be reluctant to to say that someone was a ""bad singer,"" but god help him, this guy sang like he was
    swallowing his tongue.  He poured another drink and jotted a few notes:</p><p>
    
    ""Vocal delivery has three modes: gurgling, gasping, or atonal wailing.  None pleasant.""</p><p>
    
    ""Reminds me of a pre-pubescent Robert Smith.  Sometimes.""</p><p>
    
    By the third track-- and this may just have been the Captain talking-- Our Hero started to realize that,
    aural root canal or not, the singing was just maddening enough to work with the danceable abandon Hot Hot
    Heat so desperately tried to get across.  It was crazy, but in a calculated sort of way.  Once he ""got into
    the groove"" of Heat's compulsively rhythmic strangeness it became far more palatable.  Even as he warmed to
    the vocals, however, the review remained unwritten, and time was running out.</p><p>
    
    The unique blend of salsa-flavored percussive elements that propelled ""Sleep"" faded out with piano keys
    twinkling, leading directly to a storm of hand-clapping and foot-stomping, ushering in the morse-code
    attack of Dante DeCaro's rapid fire guitar in ""Touch You Touch You.""  He had to give the band credit; the
    instrumentation was tight and inventive throughout the EP, and latin-tinged tension of ""Touch You"" was the
    high water mark.  Our Hero slowly took in the keyboard effects (ridiculously old-school lasergun tweets--
    laughable, but entertaining as hell) and jittery piano through an alcohol-addled haze; the monitor stared
    at him, and he stared back equally blankly.  At least the vocals on this one had been contained somewhat
    and were far more believably emotive than before; a nice change of pace.</p><p>
    
    Finally, as the ebullient guitar work and faint, but appreciated, harmonies of ""More for Show"" burst forth
    from the speakers where the Hello Kitty's mouth ought to have been, Our Hero was inspired.  It might have
    had something to do with the fact that this closing piece was an unexpected blast of blue skies and optimism
    from an EP that had thus far been nervous, but with a sinister swing (the same sort of vibe as ""Hell,"" by
    the Squirrel Nut Zippers), or maybe it was the lines of cocaine.  Either way, he was fired up to write; it
    would be an ill-conceived, pretentious, and self-referential narrative about the difficulties of music
    reviewing!  And it was all thanks to Hot Hot Heat's surprising new EP.  Their blending of vaguely Latin
    percussion (Hawley's drum work was easily the standout of the album), a hint of post-punk guitar-grinding,
    and truly insane vocals had grown on him like a not-so-bad fungus.  Our Hero was thrilled, until he realized
    the second obstacle that confronted him: he had no conceivable way to end the review.</p></div>"|3928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3928-knock-knock-knock-ep/|6.7|Eric Carr

First The Books album <i>Thought for Food</i> turned my head
    all the way around, and now I've been drawn deep into the world of Flim.  Dresden
    resident Enrico Wuttke is the man behind the name. According to the sleeve notes,
    he recorded tracks for this, his debut album, between 1993 and 2001. That's a hell
    of a long time to complete 11 tracks totaling 35 minutes, but when the assembled
    record sounds this good, I call it eight years well spent.</p><p>
    
    It seems right that this short, modest record took so long to put together
    because everything about <i>Given You Nothing</i> seems patient. In a world of
    ADD channel surfing, Flim calmly stays the course and lets slight variations in
    melody and tone do the work. Because the foundation is so simple, these tracks
    require a certain amount of faith on the part of the listener. You have to hear
    the quiet, whispered suggestions a few times to realize how much they're telling you.</p><p>
    
    My first listen to the album and the opening track ""Hell"" was unnerving.
    Somewhere in my subconscious, I've grown to expect certain sounds when I
    give an initial listen to an electronic release, and ""Hell"" delivered none of
    them. For the track's two-minute length, the dominant sound is piano, an
    achingly slow left hand vamp combined with concise melodic variations using
    four or five notes. Far in the distance is a barely heard synthesizer drone,
    adding the smallest digital flavoring to the pristine keyboard sound. It was
    fresh and oddly emotional, despite how little seemed to be happening. The
    following ""Plural,"" which picks up the pace but still builds around a left
    hand riff, reminded me of Vert's stunning interpretation of Keith Jarrett's
    <i>Koln Concert</i> in its contrast of perhaps the most well-known sound in
    Western music (the acoustic keyboard) with precise, detailed accents of
    processed noise.</p><p>
    
    The sounds laid down in those first two tracks set the tone for the album.
    Wuttke has a piano, a synthesizer with a button or two, and a drum machine
    he busts out when he's in the mood, and he doesn't need much else.  Unusually,
    the piano is the main instrument throughout <i>Given You Nothing</i>. I
    referenced Vert's <i>Koln Konzert</i> above and that comparison applies at
    various points throughout this album. That said, Wuttke is not improvising
    and Flim is nowhere near jazz. The similarity enters from his impressionist,
    introspective tone and pacing, and his delicate melodies.</p><p>
    
    The Tomlab website says that <i>Given You Nothing</i> owes something to Talk
    Talk's <i>Laughing Stock</i>. This comparison seemed strange to me so I gave
    the album a careful listen for clues. I discovered that ""Linker2"" does in fact
    share a tone and deep, punishing drum beat with <i>Laughing Stock</i>'s ""Ascension
    Day,"" but I still think the connection is overstated. Much of <i>Given You
    Nothing</i> has a light, childlike cast. ""My Czesko Guitar"" and ""April"" sound
    a lot like the vulnerable innocence of Nobukazu Takemura collaborator Aki
    Tsuyuko, where you almost cringe at how open and defenseless the music
    sounds.</p><p>
    
    The single word that comes to mind with Flim is ""refreshing."" It's nice to
    hear an album that uses the tools of the computer age while completely
    retaining its musicality. Good, simple tunes and the unsteady rhythm of an
    actual human being make <i>Given You Nothing</i> a record with a lot of heart.</p></div>"|3101.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3101-given-you-nothing/|8.1|Mark Richard-San

    Damn.  Looks like we lost power again.  Happens pretty often here, especially on the hottest days.  System
    overloads cause brief glitches and outages, draining the power we take for granted from our appliances and
    modern devices.  Unsaved data is lost, the fan stops circulating the air.  And when normalcy resumes, the
    clocks come back confused, blurting ""noon"" at intervals until reset.  As strong as we like to think our
    technologically advanced society is, it's telling that the electricity and power that we rely on daily
    are brought to us by an exceptionally fragile network, vulnerable to malfunction at millions of points.</p><p>
    
    Art has long been the mirror to society, from the physical and philosophical ideals suggested by Greek
    statuary, to Picasso's cubist deconstructions of wartime massacres and Hendrix dismantling ""The Star-Spangled
    Banner"" to simultaneously explore his patriotism and his disgust with the Vietnam War.  So, as we as a
    society become more reliant on technology to aid us and remember the details of our lives for us, it seems
    logical that music-- perhaps the most immediate and cathartic art form available-- should explore the
    intricacies of our relationship with technology.  It also bears noting that music, a capella singing
    notwithstanding, is a technological art form, relying on the inventions of human hands to produce and
    capture it.</p><p>
    
    In their unfortunately brief time together, Chicago's the Fire Show were more than willing to explore the
    possibilities and limitations of the equipment they had to work with, often exploiting its limitations in
    the service of expression.  Last year's mini-album <i>Above the Volcano of Flowers</i> came across as
    something of a mission statement-- the mission being simply to move forward and create something genuinely
    original and affecting, a feat the band seemed utterly prepared to accomplish.</p><p>
    
    And with their swan song, <i>Saint the Fire Show</i>, they do.  The album is a dark, unpredictable maelstrom
    of ideas, emotion and haywire technology, at times disquietingly calm and at others in danger of running
    completely off the rails.  The band opens the album in a strange place with the crippled hymn ""The Making
    of Dead Hollow,"" and for some, its intense strangeness may be somewhat offputting.  But I suspect that
    it's for this very reason that the band sequenced it this way-- that perhaps it's a means of weeding out
    the faint of heart before they've invested too much.  Here's how it unfolds:</p><p>
    
    M Resplendent's mournful falsetto hangs in empty air, untouched and natural.  It moves in simple, drifting
    phrases, never wavering or faltering, as sampling, peculiar noises and oddball musical passages crop up
    alongside it.  A clanging drum beat, a vicious guitar, reprocessed vocals and soundtrack strings all
    threaten Resplendent's moody vocalizing, but nothing really takes a swing until a full-band rhythm rises
    at the song's end for an instrumental coda.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>Saint the Fire Show</i> is hardly as weird, but no less inventive.  ""The Rabbit of My Soul Is
    the King of His Ghost,"" one of several outstanding tracks on the record, kicks in with harmonized guitars
    before dropping a colossal groove, funked up by Pyx Klos' rubbery bass.  Resplendent sing-speaks his way
    through the post-punk landscape as Olias Nil injects layered backing vocals and heavy-echo tape effects.
    ""Dollar and Cent Supplicants"" is eerie and arctic, with chilly pianos swimming through frigid oceans of
    reverb.  Sampled operatic interjections aside, the song is utterly skeletal, and as such it's the most
    piercing thing here, Resplendent's voice crawling up your spine to whisper, processed, into your ear.</p><p>
    
    ""The God Forsaken Angels of Epistemology"" creeps in on a bed of fuzz and heavily compressed drums.  The
    strings return here as well, pumping necessary organic sounds into the electronic stew.  Resplendent's
    delivery on the chorus is so perfect, it's easy to miss that the only thing backing him up is the percussion.
    But <i>Saint the Fire Show</i> is the kind of album where the details sneak up on you like that-- most of
    it is so perfectly layered that it tricks you into thinking there's more going on than there actually is.</p><p>
    
    For instance, ""Useless Romo Cravings"" never places more than four instruments behind the vocal at one time,
    yet the way it's recorded gives the impression of intricate overdubbing, the sound washing inland like the
    first break of a tsunami crashing through a coastal metropolis.  The joint production work of Graeme Gibson
    and Brian Deck is stunning as well-- the duo focuses on injecting space into the dense mix, and as a result,
    the bass still seems to float, even when weighed down by overdriven cymbals and piles of keyboards.</p><p>
    
    The closing dirge ""You are My Sunshine"" (yes, that one) uses a scarcity of sounds to elevate itself from an
    ironic cover into something genuinely desolate and despairing.  I'm absolutely positive that, while writers
    Jimmie Davis and Charles Mitchell certainly didn't intend the song as some kind of joyous celebration of
    humanity, they never meant for the song to sound quite <i>this</i> desolate.  The Fire Show focus on the
    plea of the line, ""Please don't take my sunshine away,"" spinning it into a visceral anguish, with the
    album's final embers burning out slowly as a wrecked trombone enters to sweep aside the catharsis.</p><p>
    
    And that's right around the time that you realize this is the last you'll ever hear from the Fire Show.
    The individual members will likely move on to other things, but it's an absolute shame these guys won't be
    operating as a unit again, because, in simple terms, they were tremendous.  Two brief documentary segments
    are included on this disc for your enlightenment, though they offer no insight into the band's decision to
    call it quits.  But there is one small comfort: at least this band left us their masterpiece before they
    departed.</p></div>"|3060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3060-saint-the-fire-show/|8.7|Joe Tangari

I mean, yeah, I'm all strung out on stress and I'm sure
    my skin could use a little exfoliation after all these months of swampy summer air; a trip like that might
    do me some good.  I could come back all rejuvenated, ready to take on the world with a newly relaxed
    viewpoint and ultra-healthy skin.  It'd be like in those Bioré ads!  Yet, despite not having done any
    of this, I'm still being subjected to a heavily applied bath of sludge. The production on Caesura's debut
    album's what I'm talking about, and it's not helping my skin any, much less my poor, bloodied ears.</p><p>
    This upstart San Francisco trio really deserve better sound, too, which makes listening to this album all
    the more frustrating.  Instrumentally speaking, Caesura (named for a breathing point in natural speech
    rhythms) hang together pretty damn tight, blasting home a broad range of inventive, complex arrangements
    for the standard rock trio of guitar, bass and drums.  Never mind that it's frequently difficult to tell
    the difference between the guitar and the bass on the album, these guys play with focus, and it's their
    strongest point.</p><p>
    For proof, you don't even have to listen past ""For Staged Encore,"" the band's opening salvo of nonstop
    riffage and distorted, barely audible vocals.  Rather than engage you with a melody or some sort of
    memorable musical motif, though, the band attempts to trample you under foot, moving rapidly from passage
    to passage and through a disorienting series of tempo shifts that, while well executed, don't amount to a
    hill of beans in substance.</p><p>
    Equally charged rhythmically, ""Enter, Fluorescence"" is more focused compositionally, but there's still no
    real hook to hang your hat on, and the production is unrelentingly brown and undefined.  Then there's the
    matter of the song's title and its odd placement of a comma.  Who, exactly, is Fluorescence?  All I know is
    that back in the 80s I entered a fluorescent jacket every day and all it made me was a fashion victim.
    I wouldn't go so far as to call the guys in Caesura fashion victims, as I basically support this post-punk
    renewal thing they're musically tied to, but they <i>do</i> seem to be the victims of poor planning,
    making their small mark on a trendy scene with a sound that's only about 60% fleshed out.</p><p>
    There are thirteen other songs on this album, but to talk about them would be to repeat what I said about
    the other two.  At every turn, the band throws down an impressive, heavy rhythmic attack and forgets to add
    a building to the foundation.  Vocals are buried either by distortion or by simply being mixed to low to be
    heard-- though, listening closely, it's clear that the parts aren't very engaging anyway.  Guitarist/vocalist
    Evan Rehill has enough vocal control and ability to rate as 'promising,' so it's a mystery to me why the
    band and engineer Aaron Prellwitz have decided to marginalize his voice so much. </p><p>
    The band does take a couple of admirable shots at expanding their sound, but they come off as throwaways,
    like the 50-second percussion interlude ""Compromise in Theory.""  ""Auxiliary Engine"" is mostly a
    standard-issue Caesura tune, but contains a few surprisingly clean moments where the blanket of fuzz
    is lifted to let the clean, melodic bass playing of Brad Purvis (great name!) to the fore.  ""Assassin
    Assassin"" is an oddly chaotic instrumental that alternates quiet, clattering passages with noisy explosions
    where all of the instruments bleed together.  Again.  But this time even more than usual.</p><p>
    Despite those few sidesteps, though, <i>More Specific, Less Pacific</i> is an ultimately monochromatic
    affair compromised by dirt-bound recording that only occasionally allows any space in the mix, and then
    never for long enough.  The album slams shut with the aptly named instrumental ""Brown-Out,"" which is
    technically proficient enough to reinforce the notion that Caesura can do better than this.  With any
    luck, they will in the future, but for right now, they could help themselves out by hiring a producer who
    can clean some of the mud off.</p></div>"|1215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1215-more-specific-less-pacific/|5.6|Joe Tangari

    Industries label.  The disc's blend of IDM breaks and classic shoegazer lullabies quickly earned him
    international recognition, and he soon found a natural home with the Morr Music label.  How pleased with
    himself must Thomas Morr have felt when Munk dropped his first Manual full-length, <i>Until Tomorrow</i>,
    on his Rococo gilt- and ivory-inlayed walnut desk.  It instantly captured the Morr aesthetic: the fusion
    of Powerbook beats with Slowdive's effects-pedal swoon.</p><p>
    
    Earlier this year, having given the world some time to recuperate from the bliss-out of his first LP, Munk
    joined forces with friends to flesh out his debut's gossamer glide with <i>Orion</i>, released under the
    moniker Limp.  As it turns out, that album serves as a springboard for <i>Ascend</i>.  If you haven't heard
    <i>Orion</i>, the difference between Manual's first full-length and this new album might seem a bit striking;
    where <i>Until Tomorrow</i> is etiolated and fragile, <i>Ascend</i> is strenuous and graceful.</p><p>
    
    Opening statements don't get much more transporting than ""Midnight Is Where the Day Begins.""  Out of a low
    rumble of digital ocean waves, all manner of processed chimes ripple until an angelically chorused guitar
    line threads its shimmering way into prominence. In its path follows a glorious retinue of beguiling sounds
    that never quite become a coherent melody.  It's instead an iridescent wake that fades out two-thirds of the
    way through to allow a peaceful conversation between pristine metallic flourishes and lush guitar.</p><p>
    
    Against heavy percussion echoing the DMX drum machine Vini Reilly used on his early 80s Durutti Column
    albums, swooping lines are set to ""Astoria,"" reminding me of, actually, Vangelis at his most economical.
    ""Out of the Summer"" ruminates like the peaceful passages in Tangerine Dream's ""Atem"" before Munk reminds
    the listener of his debt to Boards of Canada by introducing a sparsely plucked acoustic guitar and the
    wordless vocalizing of a child.  And once ensconced in the BoC soundscape, Munk sees no hurry to leave,
    grafting the see-sawing piano melody from Massive Attack's ""Teardrop"" to ""Casey,"" and also appropriating
    some of the granulized fuzz of Autechre's <i>Confield</i> to mask the influence of Pale Saints' ""Little
    Hammer.""  He later emerges with ""As the Moon Spins Around,"" his guitar taking enormous legato glides
    across a near-empty pace.  A tiny pulse and the occasional soft clank of alien machinery passes almost
    undetected beneath the gentle cosmic ambience.</p><p>
    
    Jonas Munk has a grasp of melody and elegance that far outstrips his young ears. <i>Ascend</i> belongs
    rightfully with the Irresistible Force's <i>It's Tomorrow Already</i> as an album of concentrated bliss and
    artful precision.  But truth be told, I'd rather not have heard <i>Orion</i> first, as it gave away the
    interim steps that would otherwise have been such a great surprise.  Next time I hear a Manual album I want
    to feel overwhelmed by his overachievement rather than comfortably pleased by it.</p></div>"|5096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5096-ascend/|8.5|Paul Cooper

Remember back to the
    first time you wiped out on your bike as a kid. Right afterward, wasn't there a heightened sense of reality?
    As if you were asleep right up to the moment when you flipped over your handlebars? You might have been
    bruised and bleeding, but after the crying was over, didn't you feel more alive than ever?</p><p>
    
    This frozen moment of awareness is something Spokane managed to extend and harness long enough to create an
    album's worth of songs. Midway through recording <i>Able Bodies</i>, the Richmond-based trio's fourth album,
    the members of Spokane were involved in a car accident in which they flipped over twice. They were lucky to
    walk away without serious injury, but the accident obviously informed the remainder of the sessions. It's
    hard not to attribute the increased urgency displayed here over previous work to their close call behind
    the wheel.</p><p>
<i>Able Bodies</i> is brief by most standards-- just under 32 minutes-- but says all it needs to say and
    still manages to carry you off into a wispy, airy world with chiming guitar, haunting violin, and minimal
    drum brush strokes. Led by Rick Alverson, formerly the helmsman of the much-lauded Virginia folk group
    Drunk, Spokane create evocative miniatures with just the bare essentials and a few well-placed embellishments:
    microcosm with a little cello here, a touch of glockenspiel there, but not enough that you could ever
    accuse Spokane's music of being baroque.</p><p>
    
    Likewise, Alverson's lyrics simply point the direction rather than take you by the hand and walk you home.
    He offers one or two concrete details, artifacts and objects, and that's about it. It's as if he knows how
    little time is given him and his fragile crew, so he tries to say more with less.  And the beauty is that
    it's always enough to get you somewhere-- through the song at the very least-- and usually somewhere you
    weren't expecting to be taken by the scant nature of the raw materials. ""I set my thin trunk of ribs in a
    room/ My full set of teeth by a horsehair broom,"" he sings on the album closer ""The Made Bed,"" revealing a
    world to those with the patience to listen. Elsewhere, his lyrics resemble the kind of fragmented thought
    you might have while pulling yourself from a twisted heap of metal that was once an automobile: fragmented,
    yes, but keenly aware of detail and with a heightened sense of the real. ""In houses/ I'm waiting/ The future
    seems misshapen/ The ease of wishing is a weight I know/ And victory is so hard to let go,"" he sings on ""In
    House."" Literally, it makes little sense, but through the delivery and the music it speaks volumes.</p><p>
    
    Comparisons with Duluth dirge-rock standard bearers Low are perhaps inevitable when discussing a band like
    Spokane, but while Low evoke images of snow-covered wastes and Midwestern desolation, Spokane have a distant,
    'Old America' quality to their sound, mainly due to the copious and haunting use of the violin. Half of the
    time it sounds like it could accompany a Ken Burns Civil War documentary on Virginia battlefields. And like
    those documentaries, <i>Able Bodies</i> conveys an air of triumph amidst the scenes of wreckage.</p></div>"|7424.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7424-able-bodies/|7.2|Jason Nickey

    complex audio software; a sudden wealth of extremely personalized, genre-less music; and a small army of
    critics, versed in pop-deconstructionism, who busy themselves with constructing new words to contain the
    sounds that they're purportedly experts on.  From 'Intelligent' Dance Music to glitch-hop to whatever-step,
    critics are quickly establishing a new vernacular of non-descriptive, esoteric terms that act as a shortcut
    to actually describing the music.</p><p>
    
    I'll be the first to admit that I'm not without sin; I've definitely splooged a few zingers into the critics'
    cannon of linguistic banality.  And when something as indefinite and mercurial as Caural's new <i>Stars on My
    Ceiling</i> drops, I get that Rumsfeldian itch to deploy the troops; ""hip-hop,"" ""electronica,"" and ""post-rock""
    anxiously clutter the front lines, while ""glitch-hop,"" ""downtempo,"" and ""tribalism"" ready themselves to swoop
    down and pigeonhole Caural into an artistic corner.  So, for the sake of maintaining my analytical integrity,
    I will attempt to refrain from namedropping any micro-genres, and instead focus on providing a naked portrayal
    of the music contained within <i>Stars on My Ceiling</i>.</p><p>
    
    ""All These Todays Just Melt into Tomorrows,"" the record's opening track, is an accessible and percussive-driven
    salvo that liberally applies a voice synth, cowbell, and various African percussion instruments.  The track
    is organic, cerebral, and fragmented, like a musical fusion of Salvador Dali and Georgia O'Keeffe, and sets
    the tone for the rest of the album. Perhaps what's most intriguing about the album is that, while Caural is
    musically manic, the distinction between sounds isn't based on track numbers.  Caural will flip the script
    in the middle of a song while carrying over various sounds from track to track, a device that denotes his
    intention that his work be experienced in its entirety. The jazzy keyboards of the first track almost
    seamlessly fade into a two-tone line that introduces ""Stick to Modeling,"" a track in which fast breaks swell
    up from a backdrop of backward music and stunted vocal samples. </p><p>
    
    Throughout <i>Stars on My Ceiling</i>, Caural attempts to inject certain aural motifs between the seemingly
    disparate sounds and samples, creating a monolithic soundscape out of asymmetrical bits and pieces.
    Juxtaposing sounds is definitely one of the themes here.  On ""Camphor,"" Caural places a mellow piano line
    against a drum line that hardens as the track progresses.  Reversing samples so that the bass sounds warped
    and inside out is another theme: ""Retrospect"" is almost entirely comprised of them, and the listener is left
    wondering what the track would sound like if it were actually played backwards.  But, for the most part,
    Caural ensures that the album is both interesting and enjoyable, and he rarely sacrifices the listener's
    pleasure to his various conceits.  With its infectious Spanish guitar, laser-like samples, and clear,
    uncluttered beat, ""Red Sunshine"" is one of the loveliest and most listenable instrumental tracks of the
    year.  And the organic, airy quality of ""Ultra Vivid"" makes it a leading contender for outside nighttime
    sex jam of the summer.</p><p>
    
    While it doesn't successfully translate into a prosaic form, on ""For Earsnot NYC"" Caural successfully brings
    the background noises (i.e., record static and recording noise) to the foreground in an attempt to illuminate
    the beauty of the incidental. While most of the song is comprised of noises that barely register on the EQ,
    Caural drops sound altogether for much of the last two tracks and uses the breaks and silences to develop a
    musical narrative.  It's an interesting concept, albeit one that feels a bit too forced and indulgent.</p><p>
    
    And self-indulgence isn't the only problem with this album. ""Mink and a Hospital Watercolor"" drifts
    dangerously close to Air territory, and although I have resisted confining Caural to a certain genre,
    whatever it is would definitely be prefaced by ""lite.""  Another major complaint is that at times Caural
    seems to be merely dabbling in the various genres that inform <i>Stars</i>, resulting in the equivalent of
    a micro-genre megastore that carries everything yet specializes in nothing.  But while <i>Stars on My Ceiling</i>
    probably isn't going to impress a hardcore devotee of any one of the genres that Caural briefly appropriates,
    for those who love highly conceptualized, original music this is a pleasure.</p></div>"|1352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1352-stars-on-my-ceiling/|7.6|Sam Chennault

    one outside of Tennessee had ever heard of, recently recorded the ""pop album of the year."" The suggestion
    ran as a banner ad atop the Pitchfork front page, and was disguised in question format (i.e. ""Snowglobe:
    Pop album of the year?""). If you're at all like this reviewer, you probably reacted to this blatant
    hype-evangelism with a curt, cynical hipster retort-- something along the lines of ""Pop Album of the Year?
    Try 'Poop Album of the Year.'"" Then you and your friends all laughed together in a warm spirit of bitter,
    self-righteous erudition. Hipsters, however, are notorious for reacting before thinking, especially to
    suggestions that something is actually <i>good</i>. So if you were one of those doubting this wintery
    'Globe, then prepare to be shamed.</p><p>
    On second thought, shame is too strong a word. That is, unless by doubting Snowglobe you also got caught
    masturbating (unlikely). Prepare instead to be lightly corrected; your bitter cynicism is about to be
    exposed as false. By who? By Snowglobe, of course. And by me, who is writing about this wonderful quartet.
    <i>Our Land Brains</i> may not be the pop album of the year, and Snowglobe is definitely not the band<i>name</i>
    of the year, but this disc sure is a dandy.</p><p>
    Whenever a band starts an album with three near-perfect pop songs, it's usually a good thing (that is,
    unless it only gets worse from there on out, but we'll tackle that issue later). <i>Our Land Brains</i>
    opens with ""Waves Rolling,"" a 60s throwback reminiscent of the Byrds and the Elephant 6 posse. Don't think
    Beatles, though; their influence is present, but Snowglobe draw from a wider pool of resources, most of
    which are American.  The second number, ""Beautiful,"" opens with a simple, playful five-chord piano
    progression. Other pianos dot in and out of the composition, some pounding lower bass notes, others
    scampering down scales at the upper registers. Percussion is composed of sleigh bells, tambourine, xylophone
    and kettle drums. Then comes the voice: ladies and gentlemen, please say hello to Brian Wilson and the
    Beach Boys. I mean that in the least derogatory way possible; somehow, vocalist Brad Postlethwaite and his
    comrades in harmony manage to bottle up a candy-sweet Beach Boys melody, replete with letter-perfect vocal
    reproduction and reconstitute it here for your listening pleasure.</p><p>
    Postlethwaite shares songwriting and lead-vocal duties with Tim Regan, who gets his first chance to display
    his wares on ""Dreamworks,"" the album's third actual song. Regan's voice tends more towards a Pete Townsend
    timbre, and his songwriting takes on a dramatic, serious mood. Prominent instrumentation on the track include
    a strong, uptempo minor-key bassline, a mournful piano vamp and horns, and a wah-wah'd guitar that's
    afforded its own 35 second solo. The lyrics are nicely poetic: ""Slip away from all you've known/ Swim
    out in the distance/ Catch a ride on the furthest star/ Colors bleed into your eyes, as you shoot through
    the distant skies of heaven."" The melody, ascending into the upper registers for the chorus, punctuates
    the emotion in the lyrics.</p><p>
    After ""Dreamworks"" is through, however, the disc begins a descent back into the land of the pop mortals.
    Most of the rest of the album is well above-average, like ""Adrenaline Mother,"" which falls somewhere
    between the Moody Blues and ""Norwegian Wood,"" and ""Muse,"" a sing-along-with-Belle-and-Sebastian-style
    melody. But some tracks plain fall flat, like ""Big City Lights,"" a seven-minute tune with a few too many
    nonsensical twists and turns, and ""Playground,"" where Postlethwaite's nasal delivery is epitomized, and his
    sense of melody is effectively disguised as a sense of the boring and clichéd.</p><p>
    ""Pop Album of the Year?"" It's possible.  Would have been even more possible had it been shorter (there are
    16 tracks on this sucka). Even if it's not, though, I wouldn't go so far as to call Bardot Records a brood
    of vipers. Their lies will have been white ones-- helpful ones, even, lies that led the deceived to some
    fricking sweet-ass music with a few superb songs and massive loads of promise. Bardot Records, you bastard
    liars, we thank you.</p></div>"|7307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7307-our-land-brains/|8.0|Brad Haywood

    punk nerd.  You don't hear much from bookish lads chatting in pubs about ""anarcho-syndicalist"" politics
    or crapping about how they never get laid.  Such topics, of course, seem gloomy on the surface, but... if
    you sugarcoat them in some catchy pop/punk you get something pretty damn good, as proven by Newcastle-upon-Tyne's
    everyday rockers, Milky Wimpshake.</p><p>
    You can hear a little bit of Billy Bragg here, and a lot of punk, but I mostly get a serious vibe of Herman's
    Hermits doing ""I'm Henry VIII I Am"" to more spastic music.  Pete Case's guitar is a gristly sandblast to the
    eardrums, buzzing over a keyed-up rhythm section, and the raw mix doesn't shave off the edges.  It could
    sound like just so much noise except that these songs are catchy and their lyrics are witty.  The hooks and
    jangle complement the distortion of ""Scrabble"" and ""Philosophical Boxing Gloves,"" and the jerky strumming
    and haphazard squalls on ""Dialling Tone"" blanket a song that could be rehabbed (and ruined) as an American
    ska-rock hit.  The band also uses harmonica, banjo and violin here and there, which adds just enough color,
    though the harmonium on ""Philosophical Boxing Gloves"" sounds a bit twee.</p><p>
    Case has a slim set of pipes, best displayed on the band's cover of Phil Ochs' ""Do What I Have To,"" where
    he strains through the broad lines of the song.  But he's adept with biting words and nimble melodies, and
    he shines on ""Jackass,"" his protest against Home Secretary and fanatic prison-builder Jack Straw.  Case also
    proves himself earnest and expressive as his songs jump from politics to love gone wrong, to his personal
    history, to an entire song about how etymology relates to the validity of ideas passed on to us by zzzzzzzzzzzz...
    er, right.  Yeah, okay, so some of these topics are a bit absurd, and the songs are sometimes reachingly
    wordy, but Case generally makes them work.  And the great cover of Spraydog's ""Lemonade"" puts him through
    lines that are more abstract and emotional, not allowing him to hunch behind his own wit.</p><p>
<i>Lovers Not Fighters</i> at times makes me wish the band would tighten up a little more-- specifically,
    that Case would sharpen his own lyrics to show how clever he really is.  His best lines are tight, witty
    and even silly: ""This song has a verse but has no chorus/ The police are out in force and looking for us.""
    On the other hand, he seems to have a rule that if he can't make a good rhyme in five minutes or less, he
    goes with whatever he has: ""Your boyfriend seems so dull/ He was probably born in Hull.""</p><p>
    Indeed, Case could definitely tighten the screws, but the lack of polish and these few awkward moments are
    probably what make the band work.  Milky Wimpshake are smart, noisy, and this close to outrage, but they're
    too modest and good-natured to let it get in the way of a good time.  And you've got to like a guy who can
    cut himself down like on the pro-cheating anthem ""Dialling Tone"": ""Yeah, I know I'm your bit on the side/
    But I hope one day you'll be all mine.""  If only the Gallaghers could be so humble.</p></div>"|5287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5287-lovers-not-fighters/|7.4|Chris Dahlen

    and unadventurous releases, is the cover's striking similarity to any number of deodorant advertisements.
    The theme continues on the back cover as the gangly English giantess is shown frolicking in the foamy surf
    wearing jean shorts and a white tanktop, leg kicked out behind her in a gesture as if to say, ""Finally a pad
    that suits my lifestyle.""  Inside, things get a little confusing, if not intriguing. The three-panel foldout
    shows:</p><p>
    
    1. A fenced-in area next to a dock and gazebo, which, like a Jandek cover, initially seems meaningful but
    leaves you with the lingering suspicion that it's probably just randomness for randomness' sake.</p><p>
    
    2. A cove in which two boats have beached: a mid-size fishing craft and a Greenpeace-style rubber raft,
    suggesting the photographer had recently watched <i>The Man with the Golden Gun</i>.  And, most perplexing
    of all:</p><p>
    
    3. Beth sitting in the above-mentioned fishing boat, back turned, apparently breastfeeding an acoustic
    guitar.</p><p>
    
    All of these photos are shown through a hazy, soft-focus glow usually reserved for soap opera flashbacks,
    Barbara Walters interviews, and <i>Jerry McGuire</i>.</p><p>
    
    Disappointingly though, this album is neither a veiled avant-feminist concept album nor some backhanded
    commentary on advertising culture and consumerism; it's rather a product of such schemes.  And after
    listening to the album, the artwork, which once was simply perplexing, becomes merely hilarious, if
    unintentionally so.</p><p>
    
    But let's move past the images and get to the heart of the matter: the music. Well, it's sad, really. An
    artist who once seemed poised to carve out a brand new style of electro-acoustic music (I once saw the
    painfully reaching term ""folk-hop"" used in a review of her previous album, <i>Central Reservation</i>) is
    here reduced to a mere mannequin upon which can be draped layer upon layer of guest artists.</p><p>
    
    The jewel case sticker, which claims that <i>Daybreaker</i> ""effortlessly cross[es] musical boundaries,""
    and is ""richly evocative and lyrically profound,"" seems pathetically hyperbolic with Orton's trademark
    mellow dreck pouring like chicken soup from the speakers.  Do they really believe this, the folks at
    Astralwerks?  Exactly what musical boundaries are being crossed here?  Yay, it's got <i>both</i> acoustic
    guitars and electronics!  The same could be said of nearly every 'new country' release rolling off the
    Nashville assembly line these days.  We're far past the point where such things are even novel; it's
    what you do with it that counts. And here, Beth and her endless brothel of collaborative misfits ain't doing
    much at all.  In fact, the enthusiasm that occasionally marked <i>Trailer Park</i>, and the emotional
    attachment that brought to life the better moments on <i>Central Reservation</i>, have utterly vanished.</p><p>
    
    Some of the Big Name guests appearing on <i>Daybreaker</i> include the Chemical Brothers, William Orbit, Ben
    Watt, and Johnny Marr, the combined talent of which, amazingly, seems to have gone into making this album
    devoid of much personally at all.  Apart from a little ""Space Oddity""-style send off on ""Mount Washington""--
    presumably courtesy of one of the above knob-twisters-- the presence of all of the above musicians passes
    unnoticeably.  Which is probably a good thing, come to think of it.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the same can't be said of Winona-bait Ryan Adams. The alternahunk-o'-the-minute's grubby paws
    are all over this record, and his presence is all too conspicuous, though his name is suspiciously left off
    the sticker.  (That Ryan, such a shy one.)  Adams seems to have taken a break of, oh, say, half an hour or
    so from smoking joints and getting his bedhead just so to write a song 'specially for Beth. ""This One's
    Gonna Bruise,"" tackles (I'm guessing) the subject of domestic violence with such, er, hard-hitting lyrics
    as: ""I feel bad for you, I feel bad for you, but I don't know why, I don't know why...""  Slippery.</p><p>
    
    I've mentioned all the peripheries accompanying this album because, after a half-dozen times through the
    album, they're all you're left with.  Apart from the opening track, the slightly rousing, string-heavy
    ""Paris Train,"" nothing genuinely reaches out and latches on. Even the blips and bloops that pop up here and
    there (such as on the title track) lose all potential effectiveness in the overproduced, glossy morass.
    But what truly separates <i>Daybreaker</i> from other Orton efforts is its lack of emotional resonance--
    moments where Beth just belts it out or where she actually seems engaged with the songs she's singing.
    But, as with her cover photo, she seems to just passively sit there as the album goes by, just another
    guest artist on a generic Astralwerks Record Project.</p><p>
    
    Orton's voice is still astounding, conjuring blurs of Joni Mitchell and a slight elvishess without resorting
    to neo-folk schlock, but it's rarely, if ever, put to good use here. The songs are just so tentative and
    directionless, and the whole electro-acoustic thing so formulaically and routinely applied, that she seems
    like a mere pawn at the mercy of her collaborators and record company.  Beth has been a guilty pleasure of
    mine since <i>Trailer Park</i>, mainly due to her strong vocals and occasional flashes of brilliance (like
    ""Pass in Time"" from <i>Central Reservation</i>).  But <i>Daybreaker</i> leaves me rightfully shamed: the
    pleasure is gone, leaving me with only the guilt.</p></div>"|6046.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6046-daybreaker/|4.8|Jason Nickey

On a Monday morning I was walking the two
    blocks to catch the bus to work. It was raining hard, I was trudging along
    under my umbrella, and it felt great. It's the driest year this area has had
    in many years, and I realized while walking that I hadn't used an umbrella
    even once in six months or more. On my discman was the new record by
    Connecticut's Landing, a loose concept album about cycles and weather called
    <i>Seasons</i>. The song playing was ""Encircled (Through Falling Leaves).""</p><p>
    
    In the second stanza of ""Encircled,"" the words ""rain... comes... falling...
    down..."" are sung in a whisper next to the wet, resonant picking of an
    acoustic guitar. The only thing that could have possibly sounded better at
    that moment would have been The Clientele, but they wouldn't have had the
    element of surprise because every damn song of theirs is about the rain.
    Landing caught me off guard and made me smile to myself on a dark, wet
    morning.</p><p>
    
    It's dry again now. I'm listening to Landing in the air-conditioned comfort
    of my living room, and something is missing. Of course, <i>Seasons</i> isn't
    having the chill-inducing effect it did when the weather seemed orchestrated
    for the theme, but in truth, I just don't like this album as much as either
    <i>Oceanless</i> or the <i>Centrefuge</i> EP. To the band's credit, they're
    stretching out on <i>Seasons</i> and trying things only hinted at before.
    Where <i>Oceanless</i> was comprised of lengthy, mindbending excursions into
    shoegaze psychedelia, on <i>Seasons</i>, Landing become a song-oriented band,
    crafting comparatively short, spare tunes that showcase the vocals of
    husband-and-wife co-leaders Aaron and Adrienne Snow.</p><p>
    
    Befitting the music, Mr. and Mrs. Snow sing in hushed whispers, where
    melodies are given gentle prodding and encouragement rather than being
    shoved into the cold world on their own. The aforementioned ""Encircled"" is
    unusual for the record in how folky it sounds, with a plucked acoustic and
    vocals high in the mix. It actually has something of a 70s singer/songwriter
    vibe to it, suggesting something quiet by Cat Stevens. I prefer this
    acoustic tunefulness to the indie slowcore of ""Clarke Street,"" where Landing
    clearly strive for Low territory, but unfortunately lack the singing ability
    required of something so clear and direct.</p><p>
    
    I much prefer the longer, more experimental tracks on <i>Seasons</i> to the
    more conventional songs. ""First Snow"" is by far my favorite, a slowly building
    wall of sound with tufts of guitar distortion gathering like white flakes in
    a pile of dead leaves. It's a song without verse or chorus featuring the
    pretty sound of Adrienne and Aaron harmonizing together, and it reminds me
    of something from Piano Magic's <i>Low Birth Weight</i> shorn of dark and gloomy
    edges. Also interesting is ""Ruins of the Morning (So Cold),"" which starts in
    a drifting, amorphous cloud of distortion, turns into a chiming, raga-like
    drone, and then transforms into a minimal slowcore track that seems like a
    completely different song, all in the span of eight minutes.</p><p>
    
    ""Blue Sky Away"" closes the album on an up note, with an open, sunny vibe
    that feels looser and more relaxed than anything preceding it. Landing have
    serious gifts with mood and texture and the move toward song structures is
    an interesting one, but at this point, their songwriting chops don't measure
    up to their way with sound. Perhaps this effort, coming relatively quickly
    after <i>Oceanless</i> and their Surface of Eceon project with Adam Forkner
    of Yume Bitsu, was just a bit rushed.</p></div>"|4669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4669-seasons/|7.3|Mark Richard-San

    somewhat outside his or her area of musical expertise and typical listening fare. When this occurs, one is
    left with one of the following options:</p><p>
    
    1) Offer foggy synopsis of what the record sounds like and derisively dismiss it for its perceived
    inability to ""rock.""</p><p>
    
    2) Write a long-winded personal anecdote about something irrelevant like loss of virginity, high school,
    or that time I stole a bodice ripper from the local drug store, and try to abstractly relate that to feeling
    produced by said album.</p><p>
    
    3) Describe the music by negative comparison (e.g. ""Well, it's not garage rock."")</p><p>
    
    4) Do some research, and offer drinks to local college radio station DJ who likes this kind of stuff in
    exchange for his informed opinion, then try to cultivate some appreciation for the music so as to not look
    like a total moron.</p><p>
    
    The trickiness of this dilemma is only exacerbated by Pitchfork's semi-official stance on music in this
    vein. You need only note that the Gas album <i>Pop</i>, a record I found equally mystifying and intimidating,
    made it onto the site's list of the 20 best records of 2000. So I made the choice any self-respecting coward
    would and went for option four.  Now that all my cards are on the table here, let's trudge onward.</p><p>
    
    Chris Smith is Australian. He is/was a singer/songwriter. Everything on <i>Map Ends</i> has been previously
    released on vinyl in Australia, but nowhere else, and never before on CD. All Music Guide (apparently
    operating under an ironic reversal of option #3, see above) mysteriously identifies him as ""power-pop"" and
    further notes that ""<i>Map Ends</i> will give audiences a good idea of his power-pop sound.""</p><p>
<i>Map Ends</i> is sort of a lush, ambient drone-- so much of a drone that I had an incredibly hard time
    following typical protocol and listening to it straight through without pause the first time I heard it.
    Every now and then, white noise, wind, and muffled voices of background radio are broken with vague
    instrumentation-- usually xylophones or toy pianos. Some of the songs, like the back-to-back ""Fake Hand""
    and ""Replacement,"" have moments of shoegazer-like feedback and resonant layering.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately for the short-attention-span'd, four of these tracks are less than six minutes long.  The
    aforementioned ""Replacement"" (which I liked) weighed in at just over twelve minutes long, could have been
    edited to roughly half of its length without losing too much of its effect. And the ""Captain, This Is It""
    (which, to me, sounds like hearing my old upstairs neighbors run the vacuum cleaner on the hardwood floor),
    with its 18+ minute runtime, helps to underscore a theory I have regarding self-indulgence and songs
    involving the word ""Captain.""  It should be noted that my DJ friend/consultant disagrees with me, citing
    ""Captain, This Is It"" as among the album's high points. He also liked ""Brazil,"" which I think sounds like
    the distant interstate from my backyard lightly amplified, but which he found appealingly scary.</p><p>
    
    I think what's done here is done well, and I respect the opinions of those whose advice I have taken while
    listening to this album. It's a stretch for me to recommend anything for which ""extended, rhythmless drone""
    serves as a positive description, but those who like this sort of thing should likely have a go of it.  I,
    in the meantime, will go about my business in unsophisticated bliss. Stay tuned for next week when I pretend
    to really amped up about listening to John Cage.</p></div>"|7265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7265-map-ends-1995-2001/|7.0|Alison Fields

From Chuck Berry birthing the ""devil's music,"" to the 70s
    pyrotechnics of KISS, to the gorily detailed Prince sex of the 1980s,
    indecency and the notion of complete self-empowerment has driven artists
    and listeners alike.  Beyond the well-known (and usually exaggerated)
    tales of devilish mischief, there are many examples of black inspiration
    producing great works of art: Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring,"" Stanley
    Kubrick's adaptation of Anthony Burgess' <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, and
    the work of Robert Crumb, just to name a few.  Free will's ties to deviance
    go back a long way, and have apparently been of use to more than just
    practitioners of the black arts.</p><p>
    
    Experimental music icon John Zorn has been living on the edge of deviance
    for some time now.  In the mid-80s, during his six month sojourns to Japan,
    repeated exposure to extreme porn and S&amp;M; rubbed off on him-- enough to find
    a place in his compositions with Naked City and afterwards.  He's produced
    soundtracks for South American gay porn, placed dead bodies and decapitated
    heads on his CD covers (there's a pentagram on the back of this one), and
    composed whole albums about deadly poisons.  Zorn seems tempted by the dark
    side, and it often brings out the best in him.</p><p>
<i>IAO</i> is his meditation on evil, specifically concerned with the Beast
    (the name <i>IAO</i> is Kabbalistically identical to 'Satan').  The liner notes
    tell me it was partially inspired by cult theorist Aleister Crowley, who spent
    most of his life practicing and writing about the concept of 'Magick.'  As much
    as I can gather, Magick was the practice of governing and empowering one's sense
    of free will through Gnostic rituals (often with sexual symbolism) and tarot
    cards, all tied together by a system of strange symbols and a mythical poem
    called ""Liber al vel Legis.""  Crowley was as subversive a figure as you're
    likely to find, and it's not hard to see how his esoteric deviance could have
    inspired Zorn to focus on primal fears and ritualistic lusts.</p><p>
    
    The music of <i>IAO</i> is classic Zorn: dark ambient exoticism, ethnic
    percussion exercises, hypnotic suspense-film music, thrash, and avant-garde
    classical.  Similar to his recent ""Music for Children"" series, he seems to
    be loosening the reins on his tradition for branding each project an isolated
    incident, opting instead to use all of his best colors on one canvas.
    ""Invocation,"" follows Crowley's ritual model, and its clanging cymbals and use
    of null space seem to nod to Nurse with Wound's similarly disturbing <i>Homotopy
    to Marie</i>.  A church organ (of all things) opens the track with dissonant,
    wavering chords, and bells rustle along both sides of the stereo.  They give
    way to a whirling tailwind, and what sounds like someone sharpening a blade.
    And like a black hole, this implodes slightly, only to supernova into a wall of
    flies.  This may actually be the loudest moment on the album, and two minutes in,
    it's apparent that Zorn's new album is one of the better records to be affiliated
    with the black arts (a short list, I know).  I won't bring up the backwards-singing
    choir or voodoo sticks, as I'm sure you'll want to experience the sheer thrill for
    yourself.</p><p>
    
    ""Sex Magick"" is probably the most straightforward tune here, a 13-minute
    tribal percussion trance.  Again, the act of ritual plays into the program--
    where Crowley may have hinted at carnal desires in his individual yoga-like
    meditations, Zorn goes for hidden jungle rites of sacrifice and ancient
    fertility.  Musically, I'm not sure the idea of these rituals isn't more
    interesting than the fairly basic groove set up by percussionists Cyro
    Baptista and Jim Pugliese, but with this music, imagery is everything.
    ""Sacred Rites of the Left-Hand Path"" uses repetitive rhythmic patterns
    again to describe the ritual, but instead of heavy percussion, Zorn uses
    understated electric and acoustic pianos, synth, and scattered hand drums.
    The prevailing atmosphere is not unlike classic Tangerine Dream (or even
    ""Everything in Its Right Place""-style Radiohead), but the strange acoustic
    interruptions emphasize the music's natural inspirations.</p><p>
    
    ""Leviathan"" features Mike Patton on lead, er, screaming, and is arguably
    the best thrash-influenced track in Zorn's entire catalog.  The chaotic
    percussion (which eventually inverts to being played backwards mid-song--
    Zorn is getting better at using the studio as an instrument) and completely
    unrestrained guitars produce a sound that wouldn't be out of place on a
    black metal album.  Even further out is ""Lucifer Rising,"" which features
    an a capella female choir.  The music is almost soothing, though dissonant,
    as the circular melody pushes higher and higher.  However, what stands out
    is the sickly, desperately tempting whispers from the soloist.  I can't
    quite make out what she's saying, but it sounds like one part seductive
    invitation, another part surreal plea for torture.</p><p>
    
    As I mentioned, <i>IAO</i> falls squarely in line with Zorn's recent projects,
    wherein he seems interested in integrating many of the elements experimented
    with over the past twenty years into a single statement.  Like 2001's <i>Songs
    from the Hermetic Theater</i>, and going back to 90s releases such as
    <i>Kristallnacht</i> and <i>Duras:Duchamp</i>, this record is an example of
    how rampant eclecticism can lead to something more than just a mishmash of
    styles.  Whatever the inspiration for <i>IAO</i>, the results are often so
    engaging (and, yes, sometimes scary) that it's hard to question Zorn's motives.
    Go ahead, come in.</p></div>"|8927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8927-iao/|8.3|Dominique Leone

    It's actually the brainchild of this guy Doug Miller. He's a sweet and caring man, and he knows how tough
    it would be for us grade-schoolers to pay attention to any sudden changes in the structure or dynamics of
    tha' Blanket, so he keeps the work really simple and repetitive. Nothing too daring or original. We couldn't
    keep up! And when he speaks, he says things really plaintive so that even we kids can understand. Like

    ""Hey, he's right! It <i>is</i> hard to sleep with open eyes!"" you realize.</p><p>
    
    ""Yeah!"" responds the child, obviously gaining in excitement. He then looks about nervously and leans toward
    you. ""But <i>really</i>,"" he stammers out, ""the Winter Blanket is just something to pass the time until
    Low's next renaissance. Its child-like simplicity, structurally speaking, won't give it much durability in
    the coming years. Shit, I'm sick of it already.""</p><p>
    
    With two knowing taps on the nose, he walks off into the traffic of dreary-eyed youths filing their way
    into the schoolhouse. You consider joining them in their uniform march, but think better of it and decide
    to catch a taxi back to Chicago. Unfortunately, while trying to hail a cab, you leave your kidneys, ribs,
    and upper chest open to spontaneous ninja attack. This mistake will be your last.</p></div>"|8708.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8708-actors-and-actresses/|4.3|Kevin Adickes

Or the beach, for that matter?  If I want to deal with dead fish
    and syringes I'll take my dad to the supermarket (he has a problem).  And that doesn't even address all those
    alien-style face-huggery things that call the water their home.  At least on land animals can be relied upon
    to have things like eyes; half the crap in the briny deep hasn't even discovered the joys of internal organs.
    Apparently, though, there are at least a few people who enjoy the ocean-- the French have been particularly
    enamored of it for several years now, sparking a long tradition of strange and disturbing films documenting
    the behavior of its contents.</p><p>
    
    Jacques Cousteau may have gotten all the glory on that front, but Jean Painleve had more art in a single
    reel of his work than Cousteau had in his whole pruny body.  Declaring that ""science is fiction,"" Painleve
    wasn't content to tamely document the exploits of octopi ""doing it"" as were so many of his contemporaries,
    preferring instead to arrange his films to not only be enlightening, but entertaining as well (he was hung
    up on invertebrate intimacy, too-- they all were-- but he was funnier about it).  Painleve ventured nearer
    to his subjects than scientific interest would dictate, artificially imbuing them with distinctly human
    characteristics like rage and sexuality through the careful editing and scoring of his films.  It didn't
    win him any points with the scientists, but the French surrealists invited him to all their picnics.</p><p>
    
    Flash forward to April 2001, the San Francisco Film Festival: eight of Painleve's most famous shorts (films,
    that is) are scheduled to be displayed, and Yo La Tengo is asked to write and perform a live score.  Long
    story short, history is born.  In case you missed it, don't fret-- your friends in Yo La Tengo have gone to
    great lengths in the studio to bring you <i>The Sounds of the Sounds of Science</i>, and you ought to thank them.  It's
    not a throwback to their earlier scattershot aesthetics, but that's obvious (it's a score for underwater
    documentaries, after all), and anyone who's well-versed with the dream-inspiring tunes from <i>And Then
    Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out</i> should have no trouble submerging themselves within these soothing
    aural vignettes.</p><p>
    
    Each track was written to accompany a specific piece of Painleve's work, and Yo la Tengo's level of success
    ranges from impressive to downright incredible.  For the few of these films that I've been fortunate enough
    to see, the Hoboken three captured the feel of each short damn near perfectly, and crafted songs so moving
    and evocative for the remainder that by the end of the album I felt as though I'd seen them all.  Even when
    the album 'picks up,' it still never strays far from a relaxed exploration of the lush organics they're able
    to draw from their standard rock setup, aided here by assorted percussive oddities (vibraphones, chimes, etc).</p><p>
    
    As calm as their most recent work has been, a more natural touchstone for <i>The Sounds of the Sounds of Science</i> is
    the Future Sound of London's <i>Lifeforms</i>.  Some ambient music seems to want nothing more than to be the
    next employee pick at Natural Wonders or some other ridiculous hippy emporium, but the best of this genre
    isn't willing to fade into the wasteland of new-age background music.  Brilliance along the lines of Aphex
    Twin's <i>Selected Ambient Works II</i> isn't so passive-- listening creates a sense of revelation, completely
    enfolding the listener in its wet, glowy womb.  <i>The Sounds of the Sounds of Science</i>, over the course of 77 minutes,
    manages to do that.</p><p>
    
    In fact, within the realm of organic ambient, Yo La Tengo may even have an advantage over a few of the
    reigning techno acts.  If the techno-organic creatures of <i>Lifeforms</i> come from Mars, Yo La Tengo's are
    distinctly Earthbound in keeping with the subject matter of these documentaries, owing mainly to the human
    qualities of the sprawling, emotive performance.  Each song is an epic, sometimes changing course two or
    more times before concluding.  ""The Sea Horse"" chronicles the male sea horse giving birth in dramatic
    fashion; ""How Jellyfishes are Born"" illustrates the diversity among jellyfishes, um, giving birth; and for
    a change of pace, ""The Love Life of the Octopus"" is about birth preliminaries (I promised you octopus sex).
    Naturally, Yo La Tengo doesn't let the thematic similarity stifle them-- each cut is vibrant and unique,
    capturing its scene with colorful tonality.</p><p>
    
    ""Shrimp Stories"" may be the album's single fault.  Some of Yo La Tengo's famous diversity shows up in this
    free-jazz inspired standout, but for this record's purposes it just seems out of place.  Mainly, <i>The Sounds
    of the Sounds of Science</i> is a document of new environments being unveiled, and ""Shrimp Stories"" seems painfully mundane
    in contrast.  It's solid, and does well at breaking the pace, but isn't exactly compelling.  But this lone
    misstep aside, the album is remarkably powerful, showing not only that Yo La Tengo are fully capable of
    penning elaborate film scores, but that their years have earned them a unique adeptness at communicating
    real emotion, human and otherwise, with conventional instrumentation.  Animal porn never sounded so good.</p></div>"|8865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8865-the-sounds-of-the-sounds-of-science/|8.0|Eric Carr

For all us old foges still wary of this newfangled 'electronic music,'
    it's nice to have a few bands here and there to hold our hand while we wade into the shallow end with our
    water wings on.  To lead those of us with terminal rockism towards the flickering LCD monitor glow, it's
    necessary to have a few artists that will meet us halfway, mixing in safe, comfortable, 'actual' instruments
    to make us feel at home before hitting us with the subliminal digital trickery.</p><p>
    
    Which is where a band like Midwest Product comes in: one of those acts that's not a rock band, not yet an
    electronic act.  One peek at the liner notes says all you need to know, as all three cats listed are
    right-slash utilitymen covering both an old-fashioned musicmaker (guitar, bass, drums) and the willfully
    mysterious task of ""electronics.""  What that information translates to is a solid base of organic drums and
    bass guitar with a walk-in closet's worth of keyboard gizmos playing hopscotch over the top and through the
    holes.</p><p>
    
    Sure, it's not an entirely groundbreaking formula, but I rather enjoy how Midwest Product falls smack dab
    in the middle between the rock and electronic leagues.  With their predominantly instrumental arrangements
    and now-it's-live/now-it's-Memorex drums, the more recent or remixed work of Tortoise springs to mind,
    albeit with less vibra-phoniness smoothing out the rocky edges.  A varied effort, <i>Specifics</i> swings
    from the shimmery guitar atmospherics of ""Reminder"" with its restrained electronic twinklings and machine
    buzzes, to the almost entirely circuit-based ""Alternator,"" a twilight exploration of microhouse's sweeps
    and clicks.</p><p>
    
    But it's the in-between stuff that hits harder; songs like ""Still Love in the Midwest"" and ""Vitamin"" that
    skillfully straddle genre boundaries.  Most strikingly, the three boys of Midwest Product know that computers
    still can't replicate the deep groove of a bonafide rhythm section, and the bass of Drew Schmeiding and
    drums of Chad Pratt create a solid continuity for the knob-twiddling antics of Mr. Ben Mullins.  Throughout
    the album, Mullins' drum loops and lower-end synthesizers do a nice happy frolic with the output of his
    fellow band members, generally avoiding the crowded-elevator toe-stepping that all too often occurs from
    these sort of man/computer collabs.</p><p>
    
    A warning, though: due in part to its instrumental nature, <i>Specifics</i> might not quite have the goods to
    win over the guitar loyalist crowd, as the album's fifty minutes have the usual electronic album side effect
    of not planting enough head-sticking melodies to prevent its fading into background music for casual
    listeners.  Even the dark synth-pop of  ""Pigeons,"" the one vocal-fortified track here, isn't quite jingle
    material and disappointingly resorts to the tired vocoder trick, a device that hasn't been scary since
    <i>Superman III</i> and hasn't been kitschy cool since <i>Moon Safari</i>.  Recording for Michigan-based
    electronic label Ghostly International isn't going to help win over the rock hordes either, as Midwest
    Product will most likely be marketed as six-string escapism for the laptop crowd, rather than vice versa.</p><p>
    
    But Ghostly International is also based out of the woody landscapes of suburban Detroit-- though, between
    us, don't tell Ann Arbor I called it a Detroit suburb-- and the moniker Midwest Product is more than just a
    (um, not especially) catchy name.  For Detroit, with its Rock City status and decidedly retro 'automobile'
    industry, might just be the right place for a successful merging of the electronic with the electric, from
    which Middle America can be gently nudged towards a <i>Tron</i>-like future.  To appeal to Joe Midwest,
    you've gotta have a backbeat that rattles the hatchback, and by providing such a feature alongside their
    electronic musings, Midwest Product has downright Moses potential.</p></div>"|5276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5276-specifics/|7.4|Rob Mitchum

Many people travel thousands of miles to
    enjoy those illicit splendors, like legal drugs, prostitutes, and assorted other vices. And over the past
    few years, Amsterdam-based indie label Konkurrent has added to this list of otherwise unavailable
    opportunities with its <i>In the Fishtank</i> series. The series, now in its eighth installment, offers
    relatively popular indie acts the opportunity to drop by Amsterdam for two days and record anything they
    choose. Some go into the studio alone, like June of 44; others go in pairs, like Tortoise + the Ex, and
    Low + Dirty Three. Rarely do the bands practice, and unfortunately, it generally shows, resulting in albums
    that are usually better than average but far from exceptional. The latest in the series, the Willard Grant
    Conspiracy + Telefunk, follows suit in its mediocrity.</p><p>
    
    The Willard Grant Conspiracy is well-known for country-folk acoustic balladry, fronted by the dour baritone
    of lead conspirator Robert Fisher. In theory, Fisher's authentic, intimate delivery would lend itself
    compellingly to collaboration with a darker, electronically minded group like Telefunk.  Yet when put to
    the test, this theory proves false. What's documented here is a short six track album of traditional covers,
    a few of which are good, and the others, which are somewhat difficult to endure.</p><p>
    
    The spacious opener, ""Twistification,"" sounds like the Willard Grant Conspiracy + the Willard Grant
    Conspiracy. Telefunk?  Undetectable. This is a running theme throughout the disc, as some tracks simply
    sound like WGC, and others simply like Telefunk with a Robert Fisher cameo. Except for ""Cuckoo,"" where a
    funky double-bassline gets peppered with a folky blend of strings, banjo and background wailing, the bands
    don't seem to be working together that well.  What I'm saying is, they missed that ""Sesame Street"" covering
    cooperation.</p><p>
    
    Of course, only a couple songs are <i>dreadfully</i> bad, but for these, 'bad' as an adjective fails to evoke
    the full experience, but suffice to say that the horror always lies in the vocals.  One of these more crap
    moments comes with ""Grun Grun Grun,"" which features Fisher and the Telefunk crew chanting the names of colors
    back and forth to one another in two languages for pretty much the duration of the track. Whoever produced it
    also found the time and energy to give it Gregorian overtones.  As anyone who's ever listened to Enigma knows,
    this can only be properly executed with the saccharine pretentiery of a whispery French chick and that one
    ethnic instrument that always manages to find its way into Neutrogena commercials.  (Follow-up hit must
    prominently feature the senilic wail of a Polio-stricken retiree pretending to be Native American.)</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""Just a Little Rain,"" is by far the worst song I have heard all year, and that includes ""Nod Ya
    Head (Black Suits Comin')."" It's hard to nail down exactly how they fucked up so royally with this track,
    but the crucial misstep seems to come with the totally non-European, faux-West Indian accent turning ""what
    have they done to the rain"" into ""what have dey done to de rain?"" I'm sorry I had to write that, but imagine
    what it was like having to <i>listen</i> to it.</p><p>
    
    The record recovers a bit with the closing track, an adequate-enough little number titled ""Dig a Hole in the
    Meadow.""  Again, Telefunk have retreated to the background here, perhaps content with the damage they've
    already wrought.  Beyond that, I don't know what you want me to say about the Willard Grant Conspiracy +
    Telefunk's <i>In the Fishtank</i>.  Uh, don't buy it?</p></div>"|8684.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8684-in-the-fishtank-with-telefunk/|5.4|Brad Haywood

    open house.  There's the kid who wants to do an all-Phish show, but who, in the interest
    of keeping things fresh, would consider mixing in some Moe.  He's often followed by the
    alarmingly socially inept kids who pitch ""a 'Loveline'-type show"", overlooking the fact
    that even radio divas like myself are lucky to get five calls on a 10-watt station.
    There's the white rapper who cries when he doesn't make the cut (actually, this is the
    same guy every semester).  And always, <i>always</i>, there are freshman girls who want
    to do an 80s show.  There are reasons these girls, enthusiastic as they most certainly are,
    do not get radio shows.  Not least amongst these reasons is that the local adult contemporary
    station does a more than adequate job of covering this era.  At least, that's what we tell
    them.  The real reason is that no one wants to be subjected to Men Without Hats again.</p><p>
    
    It's difficult to write a meaningful synth-pop song-- I've never done it (and god knows I've
    tried), but also, it's just that rare to hear one.  The genre lends itself to disposability.
    But while Herculean, it's certainly not an impossible task, and Stephin Merritt, who
    contributes lyrics and vocals to the Future Bible Heroes, has probably written a good
    percentage of the 90s' most compelling ones.  On the Magnetic Fields' excellent 1993 album,
    <i>Holiday</i>, Merritt primarily depended on synth to back his eternally deadpan vocals.
    Even the record's mid-fi production values couldn't blunt the impact of his songwriting.</p><p>
    
    But Future Bible Heroes frontman Chris Ewen just isn't a Merritt-caliber composer, and
    this EP suffers in contrast to even Merritt's b-sides.  In 1997, when the Future Bible
    Heroes' debut album was released, it was a treat.  Those were less prolific days for
    Merritt, and any output was anxiously anticipated.  Now, however, with Magnetic Fields
    fans still discovering new favorites among last year's epic <i>69 Love Songs</i>, this EP
    is disappointing.  Having explored Merritt's many musical fascinations-- <i>69 Love Songs</i>
    found him taking on John Cage, the war ballad, and Celtic music, amongst other genres rarely
    explored by pop artists-- it's difficult to return to the Future Bible Heroes' limited
    musical worldview.</p><p>
    
    The title track, a manic ode to break-ups, features Merritt's best lyrical effort here,
    offering gems like, ""I'm lonely as Mount Everest and probably as high/ It's time to buy
    the records you would never let me buy.""  ""My Blue Hawaii"" is one of Ewen's more
    compelling compositions, a near-hysterical combination of drum machines, whirs, clicks
    and sirens.  Merritt, unfortunately, is at his laziest on the song, listing every tropical
    association that occurs to him.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""Caf Hong Kong"" is too reminiscent of my least favorite Magnetic Fields song
    ever (""Tokyo A Go-Go"") for me to find any enjoyment in it, and here, as well as on ""Good
    Thing I Don't Have Any Feelings"", the band strays far too close to Human League territory.
    And it doesn't bode well for <i>I'm Lonely</i> that its strongest track is a remix of ""Hopeless"",
    a song that saw release on the Future Bible Heroes' 1997 full-length, <i>Memories of Love</i>.
    Still, the song's combination of morbid lyrics and bleepy, danceable pop proves that Merritt
    and Ewen do have their inspired collaborative moments.</p><p>
    
    Chris Ewen writes some fun, fairly interesting electro-pop, but it's his ties to Stephin
    Merritt that makes this a salable record.  The Magnetic Fields association guarantees an
    audience for the Future Bible Heroes, and a place for them on college radio.  Much like the
    spongecake recipe in <i>I'm Lonely</i>'s liner notes, Ewen's music is sugary and weightless;
    Merritt adds the ""favorite filling"" which makes it unique.  In the end, though, the EP just
    isn't substantial enough to join the exclusive ranks of memorable synth-pop records.</p></div>"|3252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3252-im-lonely-and-i-love-it-ep/|6.0|Meg Zamula

    Graham Smith (aka Kleenexgirlwonder) the once lauded lo-fi wunderkind, whose terrific early albums won
    him comparisons to Robert Pollard and charges of egoism usually reserved for artists twice his age, may
    have finally reached a point so low on the totem pole of pop relevancy that even the fifteen or so fans who
    kept the faith after the debacle that was the double-disc disaster <i>The Smith Album</i> are scratching
    their heads and wondering if it's too late to revise their opinion on the whole of Bob Pollard's solo
    career. These people need <i>something</i> to distract them from the deafening thud of Graham Smith's career
    hitting rock bottom.</p><p>
    
    The sound of <i>After Mathematics</i> could be described as Beck meets the Barenaked Ladies in gladiatorial
    combat over the muted cries of a thousand starry-eyed adolescents who-- having found their grand artistic
    vision (""Hey, wouldn't it be cool to four-track some power-pop songs and mix them up with R&amp;B; thievery and
    bad hip-hop beats?  No?"") co-opted by Mr. Smith-- have locked themselves in their suburban basements to
    consider such philosophical ponderances as, ""Could old-school pop/punk become the new ironic obsession for
    the jaded metropolitan hipster?""</p><p>
    
    Like Smith's longtime habit of scribbling self-referential lyrics and liner notes, it's hard to determine
    where the joke ends on <i>After Mathematics</i>.  I tend to assume the lyrics to ""Why I Write Such Good
    Songs"" (""No one can sing like me/ No one can play the guitar like me/ No one says the things I say/ And no
    one else ever feels this way"") are a matter of tongue-in-cheek self-satire, but is its musical similarity
    to Sugar Ray (replicated again on ""I Am a Serving Wench at a Themed Restaurant"") also part of the punchline?
    And what of the affected rapping throughout ""The Pathetic Fallacy"" and the (parodied?) gangster rap
    conclusion of the otherwise-ripe-for-a-car-commercial instrumental ""Intentional Fallacy""?  If it's all one
    big gag, Smith ought to ask himself if he's content to be better remembered for his moronic novelty than
    for the infectious pop songwriting of his past.</p><p>
    
    What hurts most is, Smith hasn't even lost his knack for insufferably catchy melodies. The sugary power-pop
    of ""Amelia"" is almost buoyant enough to stand the weight of its wordplay (""Amelia/ Ameliorate me."") Likewise,
    the punchy, if typical, concluding track ""Fitzcarraldo"" provides a brief return to the earlier and more
    palatable days of <i>Ponyoak</i>.  But these lukewarm conciliatory attempts hardly make up for all the
    computerized backing vocals (an unfortunate leftover from <i>The Smith Album</i>) or the sketchy simulations
    of platinum hip-hop.</p><p>
    
    Were I so inclined, I suppose I could muster some self-righteous anger at the overall tone of <i>After
    Mathematics</i>.  Instead I'll suffice to say that what Smith needs is to drive into the city, park the
    car in the heart of Cabrini-Green, blast this disc out his trunk, and learn firsthand what thug life is
    all about.</p></div>"|4490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4490-after-mathematics/|3.1|Alison Fields

    surrounded by affable brass and a CIA spook at a meeting so classified it doesn't even exist. A young
    Harrison Ford will be playing this album's a capella paean to dispassionate mobility, ""Nothing to Hold Us
    Here,"" on a reel-to-reel, sweating and dreaming of making out with Kate Capshaw years later in <i>Indiana
    Jones and the Temple of Doom</i>. When the album finishes, the older guy across the table from you will
    utter some you-had-to-be-there blarney about the human heart and some vicissitudes he noticed it had. Then
    he'll say, ""We think it is quite clear that Calvin Johnson has... gone insane,"" an assessment you'll be
    obliged to affirm. Then you will be told that you should ""terminate his command... with extreme prejudice,""
    and then there's some strippers in a helicopter, and then Larry Fishburne dies, etc etc.</p><p>
    During all the jinx on the boat, you'll read Calvin's dossier and sustain an intriguing inner dialogue:
    ""This guy was in Beat Happening back in the day. He's a beacon of the unpindownable punk spirit. He's
    seminal. He opened for Black Flag. He's got the last chapter in <i>Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes
    from the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991</i>. He launched the Halo Benders and Dub Narcotic Sound
    System. Criminy-shanks, man, DubNarcSS released 'Booty Run,' as randily pragmatic a seven-inch to come out
    on this planet. Johnson's an institution, like marriage and Astroglide. His fingerprints pock the legacies
    of a stable including artists as diverse as Beck and Modest Mouse. He has his own respected label. So why
    the hell would he go back into the fray, alone, with just an acoustic guitar and his acquired-taste
    throatations?""</p><p>
    When you arrive at Johnson's bizarre Olympia compound, you'll find a zonked Phil Elvrum waving his hands
    around, welcoming you, calming but also alarming you, explaining that he was Calvin's 'engineer,' though
    he sounds more like a hagiographer. He will compare Calvin to poets and legends, and shudder when extolling
    the debilitating oomph of Calvin's voice. When you finally meet Calvin, he'll have been expecting you. He
    knew you were sent to nix him.  In fact, he'd already started marketing his new album as 'posthumous.' He
    will sit in the dark, rubbing his head and explaining to you via a 4\xBD-minute (ahem) a capella song, how
    ""The Past Comes Back to Haunt."" By Calvin's side are the mysterious women Mirah and the Gossip's Beth Ditto.
    They join him in the also (cough) a capella ""Ode to St. Valentine"" and ""Lightnin Rod for Jesus,"" respectively,
    which are gorgeous and grating, respectively.</p><p>
    Hi! Thanks for reading! You know, we've had a lot of fun here today, but sometimes a feller ort to shoot
    straight: the above was an attempt to disqualify myself from having to deduct whether or not this album is
    an achievement or embarrassment. I can't figure it out. The album sounds as tossed-off as it does deliberate.
    The songs are as preposterously conceived as they are straightforwardly delivered, as jokey as they are
    sincere.  Did you catch my drift re: the perplexing amount of a capella stuff? Even as a fan of ""the voice,""
    I can't wholeheartedly recommend that you purchase this disc, which at points suggests that Johnson is eager
    to join Irwin Chusid's freak collection and become, like Daniel Johnston, someone whose work is better when
    covered (which is as good a tangent as any on which to propose that the seeds of the greatest Chris Isaak
    or Anonymous Crooner album ever are resting here).</p><p>
    But see: one point on this here CD, which is largely a 'love' project, provides a satisfying bellow of
    desire reminiscent of the first Smiths album. It comes right after the three-minute mark on ""Can We Kiss?""
    which is otherwise essentially a remake of a similarly themed but more imperative Halo Benders song.
    Suddenly, Johnson emits an ""ohohhhhohhhh"" followed by an ""uhooohhohhhowwwohh,"" that redeems the status of
    commingling foodholes; the kitsch is automatically baptized out of celebrating an old-fashion liptangle.
    ""Love Will Come Back Again,"" despite offering the popular redundancy of back-againness, is equally convincing,
    especially when Johnson booms subtle hints to his intended such as ""unbuckle that Gingham dress."" The
    aforementioned ""Valentine"" will melt the sentimental lobe of anyone lingering in love's potential orbit when
    both vocalists collide to plead, ""Ooooh, give me a sign.""</p><p>
    Despite some increments during which the vocal loudness is poorly modulated, <i>What Was Me</i> is easily
    Johnson's  best harnessing of his divisive foghorn. If I'd heard the avant-Guthrie of the scrappy,
    miss-me-when-I'm-gone title track on Internet radio, I'd run out to buy this album, being sure to topple
    several senior citizens en route to the store where the jaded hippie half-mans the register. Same goes for
    ""Lies Goodbye,"" an exercise in the elasticity of enunciation (e.g. ""rage"" becomes ""rayeeyayeeyage""). The
    individual songs may be more than the sum of their aggravatingly drumless parts, but this album as a whole
    is less than that sum. Choruses are repeated ad comatosium, and one is left to wonder what even a provisional
    backing band could have offered material like the six-minute, no-key-change, basic-chord ""Palriga."" Many of
    us are so pathetic that we want the album playing in our car after the club closes to be cool and gregarious--
    <i>What Was Me</i>'s sweet bloviations might get you snickered at.</p><p>
    Still, these songs have bullied my head for weeks. The island-strum of ""Warm Days"" has soundtracked my
    fascination with a hyper-gesticulating woman in the opposite lane who flips her cellphone the bird. ""The
    Past Comes Back to Haunt,"" for some reason, was my mantra as I stared at an SUV sporting a Jason Voorhees
    glow-in-the-dark hockey mask hanging from its rear-view, with two pine-shaped air-fresheners in the
    eyeholes. Even ""Lightnin Rod for Jesus"" colonized my brain as I watched crows eat fries out of a McBin.
    Which brings me back to wondering if this occasionally-acoustic-only album is just a nominee for the time
    capsule labeled ""Crazy Shit We Did With Our Freedom,"" or the masterwork of an aimless Cupid.</p></div>"|4277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4277-what-was-me/|6.9|William Bowers

    their indie ethics, and corporate America cooled and reshaped itself into a symbiotic coupling? When I fell
    asleep in 1991, Neil Young was preaching the evils of product placement and even Pat Boone was wore leather.
    Now, I wake up in the new millennium to a media who 'nurtures and exposes' the artists it once worked so
    hard to oppress while asking for 'little in return.' Granted, some commercial pairings can be traced back
    to a logical and rational mind, as in the case of the Shins and their donation of ""New Slang"" to McDonalds.
    But had I known that drinking MGD would make me as depressed as Bill Callahan, I'd have opted for the party
    ambience of your average Coors commercial. Seriously... I could've learned to tolerate the occasional
    'crunching blues riff.' Unfortunately, our faceless corporate antagonists have saved their most horrendous
    act of sacrilege for last, as earlier this month General Mills unveiled their newest commercial, which
    features an animated Stephen Malkmus gliding gracefully down a rainbow shat by a clearly nerve-addled
    rabbit singing ""Trix are everything to me.""</p><p>
    
    Luckily, Ian McKaye saw this coming some fifteen years before the fact. Out of sheer desperation he founded
    his independent record label, Dischord, boasting a stable of artists dedicated to satiating that whining
    Marxist in each of us. Over the years, Dischord has been a haven for acts who are as well versed in
    anti-capitalist rhetoric as they are in music theory, leaving the label with only one real problem: selling
    records. You see, when you release a consistent output of music created by artists who are hell-bent on
    never selling out, you sometimes release product that consciously sounds like crap for the sake of not being
    commercially viable. That's right, Pupils... stick to The Man.</p><p>
    
    On their eponymous debut, Daniel Higgs and Asa Osbourne run the gamut of your typical two-guitar and drum
    machine group. Truth be told, to cite this as rationalization for making such a plodding and disingenuous
    album as <i>The Pupils</i> ignores the archetypal work of Timbuk3 (admit it, you still own <i>Greetings
    From...</i>). If anything, The Pupils are consistently unremarkable. The whole disc plays like the White
    Stripes covered by a small geriatric community, afraid or unaware of how to change tempo with a drum
    machine.  Sounds like a novelty worthy of Langley School's fame!</p><p>
    
    Having an established musical precedent to contend with can only hinder the critical reception of a
    side project and, despite the fact that Osbourne and Higgs have only managed to break new ground for
    mediocrity in their day job as Lungfish, the album sorely misses the sophisticated dynamics
    and occasionally evocative lyrical content of <i>The Unanimous Hour</i> or <i>Pass and Stow</i>. Rather,
    we get a litany of muddied social observations (""All the People"") and a few psilocybin-induced meanderings
    (""The Mind is a Hole in the Body,"" ""I Will Remain Human for Another Day""). If this album truly is, as the
    lyrics suggest, the product of a few nights of inebriated excess, I strongly urge The Pupils to enter a
    12-step program. That way, when they finally reach step nine and ""make direct amends to all persons they've
    harmed, except when to do so would injure them or others,"" I might get an apology for having to write about
    this crap.</p></div>"|6514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6514-the-pupils/|3.0|Kevin Adickes

The new Jana McCall album is here, and that means you'll want to
    stick around for at least another 45 minutes.  That opening sentence might seem tasteless, but if it does,
    it's probably because you aren't familiar with the sleepy, mournful tunes that are Jana's stock in trade.
    Think of it as simply addressing her target audience.  Fortunately, with <i>Slumber</i>, Miss McCall has
    succeeded in crafting an album of remarkable strength, sorrow, and diversity, all while maintaining her
    peculiar brand of eerily melodic atmospherics.  There's a lot to like here, even if you aren't quite ready
    to teach this cold, cruel world a lesson and shuffle off this mortal coil.  If you are, though, don't rule
    it out as the soundtrack for an absinthe overdose.</p><p>
    
    Okay, so I'm exaggerating slightly. <i>Slumber</i> isn't truly depressing; it's just moody and evocative.
    McCall's debut highlighted her remarkable ability to lead the listener through deep sojourns across dusty
    sonic backroads, distantly guided by the gloomy, western light of Mazzy Star.  The self-titled debut was a
    compelling bit of theater, but in the end, McCall's gloom-and-doom folk started to wear itself out, if only
    out of consistency which bordered on homogeneity.  <i>Slumber</i>, though, manages to take the sounds of
    the Cowboy Junkies at their most sober and subdued and greatly expand upon them-- the flourishes of varied
    instrumentation and tone completely rejuvenate McCall's carefully crafted ballads.  Airy strings, errant
    electronic tones, and what may or may not be a tuba (no promises) on ""Carolina's Crown"" work wonders to
    deepen this album's sound.</p><p>
    
    From the outset, ""Eyes Aglow"" makes it clear that Jana won't be satisfied by merely producing dulcet
    melodies (even though she later proves on several tracks that she's more than up to the task); she presents
    the accompaniment of awkward, slightly dissonant synthetic notes that don't quite fit.  It challenges the
    listener immediately, if only subtly-- her dusky, heartfelt vocals supported by tones which just aren't
    quite right.  It's distracting, but only for a moment, and once the strangeness is reconciled, it's truly
    gripping.  The desire to confront the listener continues with the horns on ""Carolina's Crown"" and the
    screeching electronics behind ""Bloodlines,"" and proceeds to recur throughout.  In rare instances, it does
    more harm than good by putting too much distance between the music and the listener, but it's ambitious
    nonetheless.</p><p>
    
    Thematically, <i>Slumber</i> doesn't stray far from the hangman's noose, and doomsday lyrics along the lines
    of, ""Today is a brand new day/ Waiting for the sun to die/ Inside your mind,"" lose their impact after six or
    seven different configurations.  More than once, McCall steers the album dangerously close to ambient
    darkwave, a la Lycia, when these vocals are coupled with <i>Slumber</i>'s most plodding, aimless cuts.
    Still, that's not necessarily a bad thing in small doses, and McCall does an enviable job of pacing the
    album to prevent it from falling into the trap of her debut.  There's a lot of minute variety present,
    and she never goes too far into a dismal stretch without providing at least a glimmer of light at the end
    of a .45 caliber barrel.  Some of the most transcendent moments come from the gorgeous, uplifting strings
    at the close of ""Birthday,"" the soothing strings of ""Bloodlines"" which offset the electronic background
    wailing, and the electric guitar straight out of <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> on ""Echoes"" which is
    followed briefly by a surge of cascading synths, horns, and vocal harmonies.</p><p>
    
    And naturally, the thread that binds this darkling web of songs together is the voice of McCall herself.
    Most of the album is characterized by a sultry half-whisper or lullaby, which goes a long way towards
    selling the creepy imagery she waxes on about.  Occasionally, she jumps to a higher register (""Clary"")
    just to indicate range (and she has plenty), but no matter what, her vocals are always the strongest
    asset.  Which is lucky for her, since it's tough to be a singer/songwriter if you can't fit your voice to
    your music-- especially when that music is brooding, spacious gothic-tinged folk.</p></div>"|5175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5175-slumber/|7.4|Eric Carr

Hip-hop is dirty, concrete, in-your-face visceral, and
    reflective of an on-going public discourse.  <i>Seed to Sun</i>, which is a mostly instrumental offering,
    is tightly enclosed and intensely internal; the sound doesn't attempt to capture the public zeitgeist,
    instead preferring to meander through a cryptic inner space in search of slight, fleeting emotions and
    repressed memories. At its best, it works as a soundtrack to the prolonged moments of silence that
    accompany technological isolation. Yet this isn't another dry, droid-like testament to the dystopia of
    post-millennial life.  Its focus is generally more human than it is mechanical, and it's more tenderly
    emotive than it is dryly disjointed.</p><p>
    Although <i>Seed to Sun</i> is a very personal affair, the music is identifiably derivative. Boom Bip
    (aka Bryan Hollon) engages in what seems like incessant genre-hopping; suburban hip-hop, wankish laptop
    conceptualism, and cinematic post-rock are all indiscriminately plucked from Boom Bip's musical milieus
    and given generous footing on this record.  Still, Hollon maintains a consistency throughout by constantly
    reinforcing his musical motifs.  Looped, barely suppressed voices can be heard throughout, and a high-pitch
    ringing sound is never far off, acting as a musical highwire that the various breakbeats and synth lines
    cling to. Thematically, the album oscillates between three different moods: the intricate melancholy of
    monotony; the broad sweeping attempts to transcend the clutter; and what is perhaps the triumphant failure
    of the warring tensions: when Hollon abandons his attempts at transcendence and embraces the playful
    possibilities that flutter around the edges of the techno wasteland.</p><p>
<i>Seed to Sun</i> works best when it's either quirkily repetitive or resigning itself to funky
    experimentation.  When it attempts to be anthemic and triumphant, it falls flat.  ""Roads Must Rule,""
    which kicks off the album, contains a looping violin sample that comes across as forced, clichéd, and more
    than a little similar to disposable soundtrack music that denotes a victorious climax.  The circus music
    quality of ""Newly Weds"" wouldn't feel out of place as one of the brief musical interludes on Tom Waits'
    <i>Swordfishtrombones</i>, while ""U R Here,"" which follows ""Newly Weds,"" resembles Múm, except with a
    juicier hip-hop beat.  The static and transposed conversations of ""Pulse All Over"" are effective if a bit
    incidental. The discordant vibe carries itself through the first minute of the next track, ""Awaiting an
    Accident,"" before giving way to a smoky, almost gothic beat that sounds something like a Depeche Mode remix.</p><p>
    Hollon also offers a couple of vocal tracks which pop up sporadically throughout the album.  ""The Unthinkable,""
    which features spoken-word artist Buck 65, boasts an ironically bouncy beat. ""No matter what, I still can't
    sleep/ Everywhere I still see ghost,"" Buck 65 sings in the chorus, and the song feels like a half-awake
    recitation of random, eerie suburban imagery.  The seemingly unrelated scenes that Buck 65 conjures are
    both mundane and magical, which can be said to inform Boom Bip's style in general. By extracting the minor
    aural nuances of everyday life and tinkering with them just enough to slightly skewer their context, Boom
    Bip conjures the artful from the mechanical like some wired snake charmer.  At his best, he taps into the
    internal logic that guides the random beeps and squeaks that generally slide beneath our immediate
    consciousness.  But when his hand is too strong, and he attempts to place the noises within a more
    traditional song structure, it's an embarrassing failure.  Still, this is experimental music, and
    occasional failures can be forgiven.</p></div>"|858.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/858-seed-to-sun/|7.3|Sam Chennault

I Am the World
    Trade Center know my pain; thanks to a certain day last fall, the thought-associations their name evoked
    changed from kitschy capitalistic monolith to slow-motion catastrophe replay.  Sensitive to the country's
    general freaked-outedness but still needing to pay their bills, Dan Geller and Amy Dykes continued touring
    under the slightly censored moniker I Am The... for a while.  But with the release of <i>The Tight Connection</i>,
    the duo have resumed using their original name, boldly leading the way back to normalcy for similar hard-luck
    acts like Burning Airlines, Anthrax, and little-known Albuquerque high-school group O-Ska-ma Bin Laden.</p><p>
    
    Now, after reading album reviews assessing the role of everyone from Andrew WK to Nelly in our new
    hyper-paranoid age, I made a personal vow never to wrassle with Spooky Tuesday-related themes in my own
    work, and I won't bite on the alluring bait this album offers.  I will observe, however, that the band's
    quick and fairly non-controversial resumption of the World Trade Center title (cynical publicity reasons
    aside) closely parallels our country's own short-term memory with disaster.  Just as they're already
    slinging around plans to rebuild the WTC to reclaim precious lost office space, and the country has returned
    to losing sleep over the Dow rather than Middle-Eastern insurgents, the band sees no reason to lose brand
    loyalty with a pesky, confusing name change.</p><p>
    
    Makes sense, though, since musically, that same collective short-term memory is exactly what I Am the World
    Trade Center banks on.  Coloring carefully between the lines laid out by their eighties synth-pop ancestors,
    Geller and Dykes do little with their updated technology that would sound unfamiliar to the asymmetrically
    coifed hordes should <i>The Tight Connection</i> be shot back to 1986 in a time machine.  It's laptops
    instead of octagonal drum pads, but can you tell the difference?</p><p>
    
    Owners of I Am the World Trade Center's previous album, <i>Out of the Loop</i>, already know this, but repeat
    visitors might be surprised by the greater emphasis upon the synth part of the band's musical equation.  I
    Am the WTC's songs go down easier when samples provide at least a tenuous link back to the world of actual
    instruments, as on <i>Loop</i>'s flute-y ""Me to Be"" or the theme-show-brass of <i>The Tight Connection</i>'s
    ""Dancing Alone.""  By comparison, the machine-bought drum breaks and parade of synthesizers found on tracks
    like ""Believe in Me"" and ""California Dreaming Again"" are a little too cold and rigid like for the oh-happy-day
    vibe they attempt to create, like a keyboard demo preset.</p><p>
    
    Of course, even the iciest Powerbook arrangement can be warmed up with a charismatic vocal, but Dykes' cords
    hardly move the mercury.  Preferring a low-range, low-variability style, Dykes' singing bears an unfortunate
    resemblance to the squirmingly awkward Joey Lauren Adams musical number in <i>Chasing Amy</i>-- look no
    further than the rather flat take on Blondie's ""Call Me.""  The detached, semi-ironic delivery doesn't play
    well with the perky club beats, making even the slam-dunk seductive questions of ""Big Star"" (""do you want to
    drive around in a big car?"") sound less than alluring.</p><p>
    
    This could-be-irony is ultimately what brings down <i>The Tight Connection</i>, plopping I Am the World Trade
    Center down in an uncomfortable middle region between your deadly serious synth acts (i.e. The Faint) and
    your bubblegum brand (i.e. any synth-laden radio single from 1981-1988).  Without any significant additions
    to the field, it's hard to imagine what niche the album fills that couldn't be filled by, say, a highlights
    mix-tape of that seven-disc 1980s collection Rhino recently released.  If your record collection sorely lacks
    a boy/girl duo with a Reagan-era fixation, going with Adult is probably the better bet.  At the very least,
    their bandname will release far fewer repressed memories.</p></div>"|4039.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4039-the-tight-connection/|5.0|Rob Mitchum

I could eat a cream cheese bagel every morning
    for the rest of my life and never get tired of it. Unfortunately, the
    musical equivalent of a cream cheese bagel is hard to find. Most artists,
    albums or genres, if I hear too much over a certain period, eventually start
    to wear. Often this happens gradually over a long stretch of time, so
    gradually that I can't pinpoint when my affection started to change. Other
    times my dissatisfaction comes over me in a wave and I have a moment of
    clarity.</p><p>
    
    I believe Akufen's <i>My Way</i> marks the precise moment I started to get a
    little bored of this strand of microhouse. It's not really fair to Akufen that
    it happened to catch me at this time, because as records in this genre go, this
    is a good one. The beats are crisp and funky, a good many of the melodies
    are memorable, and the concept is interesting enough. A quick note on the
    latter-- Akufen (Mark Leclair of Montreal) uses a technique he calls
    ""microsampling"" to gather raw materials for his tracks. This method involves
    recording tiny fragments of radio transmissions and recontextualizing the
    sounds into his pumping, stripped down house rhythms. Favorite Akufen
    snippets are brief acoustic guitar riffs, one-syllable vocalizations, and
    quick string stabs. It's a distinctive sonic signature that gives his tracks
    load of possibility.</p><p>
    
    And it sounds good, really it does. Yet, the half dozen times I listened to
    this album, my primary thought was, <i>Do I need another record that sounds
    like this?</i> Even though Akufen meticulously builds complex riffs into
    these tracks from dozens of stray sound fragments, and even though he layers
    these sounds above propulsive and endlessly danceable beats, <i>My Way</i>
    doesn't really stand out for me. In truth, when the thick clusters of sampled
    sound get past a certain density, I just find them annoying.</p><p>
    
    My favorite track on <i>My Way</i> is the most focused, the overtly pretty
    ""Skidoos."" It takes its time building up from an opening of dubby percussion
    and processed samples, but after a vaporous synth drone folds in, the 4/4
    beat and grabby bassline identify the tune as an energizing dance track. Key
    to its appeal is the ping-ponging vocal riff that appears and reappears, a
    killer hook that makes the track seem close to a 'song' in the traditional
    sense of the word, even though the singing is clipped and wordless. Beats
    this danceable deserve a little bit of pop, and ""Skidoos"" does not disappoint.
    If I ever make it inside a club again, I hope to hear something as blissed
    out as this.</p><p>
    
    After that peak, the rest of <i>My Way</i> is fine and reliable but never great.
    ""Heaven Can Wait"" has some R&amp;B; vocal samples with similar emotional power,
    although the cluttered arrangement diminishes the return. ""Deck the House""
    takes the prize in terms of technical expertise, with chords, rhythms,
    melodies and counter-melodies all generated from tiny dust particles of
    sound that fly past so quickly your brain barely has time to make out the
    pattern. After that, there's a whole lot of 'this sounds interesting' and
    very little engagement. The truth is, I'm not sure how much new glitchy
    house I need in my collection at the moment. I still find Farben and Herbert
    stunning, and MRI's <i>All That Glitters</i> remains great fun. But I do know
    that when I next reach for something in this vein, Akufen will fall pretty far
    down my list.</p></div>"|91.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/91-my-way/|6.8|Mark Richard-San

Four young guys from Australia determined to tear it up in the States, their end goal being the
    glorious egotrip of international rock stardom.  Now, let's be fair-- most guys starting bands regularly entertain notions
    of 'hitting the bigtime,' and there isn't a goddamn thing wrong with that.  It's just that few are content
    to play it quite so safe.  Even the metal guys have personality.  And while I imagine that, somewhere beneath
    their media-friendly exterior, The Vines might be real characters, you'll find no trace of it on their
    Capitol Records debut, <i>Highly Evolved</i>.  I picture Craig Nicholls and Ryan Griffiths in some lavish
    London hotel suite at this very moment trying to figure out some way to glue the TV to the ceiling.  (Not
    so easy, is it, champs?)  Then Patrick Matthews walks out of the shower demanding, ""Ayy, whicha you blokes
    whacked off in the shampoo?""  Hilarity ensues!  It's like The Monkees if they wanted to be, say, Silverchair
    instead of the Beatles.</p><p>
    
    Yet no life signs penetrate the crystal clarity of this album.  I'd even go so far as to say that <i>Highly
    Evolved</i> may actually be the least <i>fun</i> record of the year, with its grungy vocals and hamfisted
    guitarwork-- not to mention the vintage Brit-pop and soaring harmonies they've tossed in for broad-range
    accessibility.  It's not even a problem that they tattoo their influences on their foreheads and add nothing
    to what they steal from The Verve (on the slow songs), Nirvana (if Nirvana were a pop act), and the rest of
    commercial radio's last twenty years.  But did they have to make it so dull?  I mean, I understand that it's
    already a hit, and if anyone gets laid this summer because of this album, that trumps whatever I can say
    about it.  But <i>Highly Evolved</i> has 'dad rock' written all over it.  It reeks of product, right down
    to the special $6 purchase price most stores are pushing: ""Why <i>not</i> check out the Vines?""</p><p>
    
    Of course, the production, courtesy of Rob Schnapf, is impeccable.  But then, in typical Schnapf form, it's
    <i>too</i> impeccable.  He's lent his Mr. Clean polish job to luminaries like Beck, as well as many bands
    who didn't need it-- Guided by Voices, for one example, Elliott Smith for another-- and while <i>Highly
    Evolved</i> is lush, having been recorded in L.A. over two months with Schnapf's mood-setting collection
    of vintage instruments, it also sounds plastic; he doesn't let the band make a single mistake anywhere on
    the album.</p><p>
    
    Schnapf's production is somewhat augmented by Craig Nicholls, singer, guitarist and lead songwriter, whose
    mushmouthed vocals at least stray from sterility.  Problem is, his unintelligible croon doesn't really work
    with the more sentimental tracks (which account for at least half the songs here), and even when the music
    ascends to garage-style rock, his only communicable emotion is the time-honored bratty sneer.  Still,
    Nicholls is a natural talent as a writer.  He already knows from killer hooks-- ""Highly Evolved"" and
    ""Outtathaway!"" are fine grunge, switching from bare strumming to throbbing, jagged, yet infectious guitar
    lines.  ""Get Free"" kicks off with a riff like revving up a lawnmower, and the chorus shows off the band's
    perfectly pitch-corrected vocal harmonies-- even if the extra-catchy bridge sounds tacked on to make it a
    bigger hit.  And the mini-epic ""1969,"" though sprawling and indulgent, is genuinely refreshing after
    squeaky-clean hard rock like ""In the Jungle"" and the obnoxiously beach-ready ""Sunshinin'"": its tortured
    mess of an outro drags on long enough that, for once, the two guitarists actually find room to breathe.</p><p>
<i>Highly Evolved</i> also slows down for some endearing pop, like the peppy, syncopated ""Factory.""  Mellow
    love song ""Mary Jane"" shows Nicholls' most sincere and affecting vocals, and ""Autumn Shade,"" colored with
    acoustic guitar and piano, echoes the melody and eerie harmonies of the Beatles' ""Because.""  But then he
    gets all serious on us with the yearning harmonies of ""Country Yard"" and the over-earnest ""Homesick.""  They
    haven't even been on the road six months and they've already found time to miss Australia?</p><p>
    
    The Vines get credit for ambition, but <i>Highly Evolved</i> covers so much ground that none of it seems
    convincing: there's just no emotional depth here.  Nicholls is not yet a great singer, and his feelings
    outpace his ability to express them.   But moreover, the Vines are adept enough at rock pastiche that they
    miss why the Beatles took a decade to get to <i>Let It Be</i>.  With Schnapf's help, they've crammed an entire
    career into one album: from song to song we skip from hard-rock teen raunch, to the popcraft of a well-behaved
    studio band, to the old-soul, ""wish I were home again"" pathos of mature, balding rockers.  And it all has
    to come through a sneer.</p></div>"|8471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8471-highly-evolved/|4.1|Chris Dahlen

    The 'Auburn Lull'-- that warm, radiant feeling that stays with you when your girlfriend's gone home, after
    a psychedelic trip or just a long, lazy day at the beach.  It's an apt name for the musicians, who holed up
    between the summer of 1997 and the spring of 1998 and carved out the thick slabs of resonance that became
    <i>Alone I Admire</i>.  The album was originally released in 1999 on Burnt Hair Records, the Michigan label
    known for drone excursions by groups like Füxa and Windy &amp; Carl, and it's been out-of-print since shortly
    thereafter.  Darla was wise to secure the reissue: this is a classic, transcending notions of space-rock
    and shoegazing to reach an apotheosis of pure, vibrant sound.</p><p>
    A massive amount of production work went into <i>Alone I Admire</i>, no doubt due in part to producer Andrew
    Prinz of Mahogany.  The sleeve notes mention the array of microphones spread throughout the studio, centered
    especially around the drums to create a sensation of depth.  The guitar signals were bi-amped for dense
    resolution, and ""it should be noted that several different kinds of sampling and delay units were utilized,
    as well as a gregarious amount of external reverberation processors.""  Afterwards the songs were enhanced by
    further editing and tape looping, and eventually fed into a 16-channel mixing desk.  As a result, these slow
    songs evolve gently through some of the most eyelid-shudderingly rich sonic layers I've ever heard.
    Audiophiles will revel in a record that finally tests their systems to the limit.</p><p>
    The group begins each track with a simple rhythmic idea, as with the steady cymbal tick that opens ""Stockard
    Drive.""  A sheet of sound rises up, instruments completely indistinguishable, just this sustained choral hum
    that builds as the male singer breathes a light refrain.  Nothing prepares you for the burst that follows,
    though, as a searing ray that was once a guitar soars upwards into a gorgeous heliosphere.  The timbres
    throughout <i>Alone I Admire</i> have you reaching sheepishly for embarrassing adjectives like 'glorious' or
    'sacred.'  There's an all-enveloping, alien perfection to the music that even some legendarily obsessive
    musicians couldn't quite craft.</p><p>
    The Auburn Lull's success has to do somewhat with the minimal instrumentation they chose.  Bass, guitar and
    drums are augmented by other strings and occasional tape loops and piano strains.  ""Old Mission"" features the
    bowing of a cello, its solitary nature setting a melancholy counterpoint against the orchestral swell of
    guitars that follows.  ""Blur My Thoughts"" brightens the mood as angelic pulse tones descend amongst the
    cavernous bass drum reverb, a constant shimmering that reminds me of Seefeel.  That's one of the only
    comparisons necessary for these otherworldly atmospheres, though, and ethereal vocals intrude to draw you
    out of total reverie.  A sample of foreign language chatter from the television ends the piece on a tense
    note.</p><p>
    The album's careful to keep enough progressions in play to avoid floating away entirely.  On ""Desert,"" the
    sheen of the guitar permeates the mix at first, chipped into recognizable form by the circling strokes of
    the percussion.  Then a deep rhythm line rises, like dub played on double-bass, shifting the piece into
    forward motion.  Again, the male/female vocal harmony chimes together like a psalm, and the lyrics (""leave
    without a clue..."") turn the title into a verb.  But despite the utterly solemn moments on the album, it's
    striking how nice the melodies are overall.  ""The Last Beat"" in particular heightens the pace with a faster
    drum shuffle, and the oscillating scree of the guitar brings peaceful images of seagulls gliding over
    shorelines.  It's simply beautiful, uplifting music.</p><p>
    Environments this pristine and patient inevitably get tagged as 'glacial,' but the Auburn Lull drift through
    spaces far more nebulous, like billowing clouds ringing mountaintops.  Of course, some listeners might get
    lost in the haze, and there will be some who say that the album puts them to sleep.  That's partly the point:
    whereas the rock-oriented shoegazer bands were content to coat their pop songs in cycles of distortion, the
    Auburn Lull finds an even more engrossing starting point deep within the decay of reverberation.  You'll find
    yourself lulled by the swirling sounds, always spinning forward and yet echoing in the past's delay, caught
    up in the doldrums and realizing it's a lovely place to be.  They may have recorded only one album, but the
    Auburn Lull have made music fine enough to die to, and I don't think I alone admire their ability to bring
    heaven to the earth.</p></div>"|351.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/351-alone-i-admire/|9.0|Christopher Dare

In an era when even many supposedly live albums have the rough spots smoothed over in the
    studio, that's not a phrase you see every day.  It's not really a strange idea, of course-- for ages, all
    music was recorded sans-overdubbing.  But the recording revolutions of the 1960s changed the way things
    were done to such an extent that it became a rarity for musicians to record their takes simultaneously,
    opting instead for the illusion of pitch-perfection and impeccable timing.</p><p>
    
    I think this is one of the reasons that <i>The Way I Feel Today</i>, the third album from Nottingham,
    England combo Six by Seven, sounds so refreshing.  Recorded live in the studio, without a single overdub,
    the album has an urgency and unpolished energy that most music simply doesn't possess.  Whittled down to a
    quartet with the departure of guitarist Sam Hempton, Six by Seven sound hungry, focused and ready to blast
    your internal organs into a mushy pulp.</p><p>
    
    They can mash away for all I care, because for the most part, the band's assault hurts in a very good way.
    They're at their best when the throttle is all the way forward, drummer Chris Davis flailing with
    Animal-esque intensity and Paul Douglas' bass throbbing just above him.  The two are a potent rhythm
    section, falling somewhere between the shoegazer drone of Ride and the brawling catharsis of classic
    UK post-punk.</p><p>
    
    The album opens on a deceptively clean note, with James Flower's repetitive piano figure and Chris Olley's
    vocals floating above.  ""Last night I thought I heard you/ Stepping through the door/ You and me were so
    beautiful/ It must have been a dream,"" he gently intones as an unsettling organ enters, setting up the line,
    ""You know they really screwed you up before you tumbled down,"" which is repeated as the song ramps to its
    climactic explosion of dirty guitar.  The band's fusion of noise and melody has never been more seamless
    than it is here, and Olley is shaping up to be not only a fantastic vocalist but also a remarkably effective
    slash 'n' burn guitarist.</p><p>
    
    The band have an obvious single on their hands in ""I.O.U. Love"" (assuming, of course, that the world doesn't
    mind being re-fed The Church's ""Under the Milky Way""-- which they probably should), a propulsive, organ-soaked
    confection that shelves the noise in favor of jangle and vocal harmonies.  ""All My New Best Friends"" backs off
    from the noise even further, with Olley picking on an acoustic guitar and Flower providing texture with his
    organ and surprisingly tasteful synthetic string sounds.</p><p>
    
    After the first three songs, it's tempting to believe the band are softening, but any such inkling is
    immediately obliterated by ""Flypaper for Freaks,"" a larynx-shredding punk onslaught that I found dangerous
    to drive to.  ""I never promised you shit"" shouts Olley as the whole band crashes in at once.  And from here,
    the album never looks back.  ""Speed Is In, Speed Is Out"" is rocket-fueled, fire-spitting rock and roll,
    while the wall of organ and distorted guitar in ""Karen O"" rides a pile-driving beat so tight it can only
    be looped.</p><p>
    
    ""American Beer"" is built on a droning organ and shoved forward by raw drums.  The track builds in intensity
    as the guitar gets louder and Olley's vocals morph from resigned and melodic to ragged and angry.  Each line
    he sings seems to make him more enraged, until the anger finally gives at the end and he and the band return
    to resignation.</p><p>
    
    The band missteps a bit in the album's final quarter, allowing ""Cafeteria Rats"" and the droning title track
    to trail on for a bit too long, but in their own rights, these are effective songs, despite being less
    immediate than the two-minutes-and-change punk eruptions that comprise the album's most gripping moments.
    However, the band roars back with a vengeance on the pummeling closer, ""Bad Man,"" which recalls the opening
    one-two punch of ""Eat Junk Become Junk"" and ""Sawn-Off Metallica T-Shirt"" from 2000's <i>The Closer You Get</i>.</p><p>
    
    The final impression one gets from the album is that Six by Seven must put on one hell of a live show if
    they're capable of sounding like this without any help from post-production add-ons.  They're obviously
    very well-rehearsed, as there's not a discernable mistake anywhere to be found here, but the music benefits
    immensely from the spontaneity inherent in live performance.  The fact that Chris Olley delivered these
    vocal performances in uninterrupted takes is impressive, too, as he makes a case for being one of the best
    singers going in today's rock world.  This band obviously has a lot of steam in them-- let's hope they blow
    some more of it off on another record soon.</p></div>"|7192.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7192-the-way-i-feel-today/|7.7|Joe Tangari

<p>Introduction: Jay Bennett's always been something of a wild card in the Wilco deck.  A renowned     session musician who joined up for the majestic double-album <i>Being There</i>, Bennett gradually     accumulated influence over the band's sound, and according to some, was primarily responsible for     the band's shift from twangy traditionalism to tentative pop experimentalism.  However, at some     point during the <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> sessions, Bennett wore out his welcome as creative     foil to lead Wilcolyte Jeff Tweedy and departed for the wilderness of a duo career with longtime     confidant Burch.  But, perhaps as part of his severance package, Bennett has thrown two <i>YHF</i> leftovers onto his debut effort: rocker ""Shakin' Sugar"" (sometimes known on Wilco forums as     ""Alone"") and purty piano ballad ""Venus Stop the Train.""  Now, thanks to the wonders of digital     technology, we can pit the Wilco and Bennett versions against each other cockfight-style, and in     doing so, shed some light upon Bennett's past and future.</p>
<p>Methods: Bring over a couple of CD players from last weekend's <i>Zaireeka</i> party, pop in your     copy of <i>The Palace at 4am</i>, and dig out that disc of <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> demos and     outtakes you salvaged from the file-sharing rummage sale.  It's time for a little compare and     contrast so that we might shake out just how important Jay Bennett was to current king-of-the-rock-galaxy     Wilco.</p>
<p>Results: The findings may be inconclusive (the completeness of the Wilco outtakes is unknown, not to     mention whether Jim ""Pappy"" O'Rourke was yet involved at the time of their recording), but it don't     look so good for Herr Bennett.  ""Shakin' Sugar"" remains largely unchanged from its unremarkable     organ-driven barnburner Wilco version, a song that, were it included on <i>YHF</i>, would've been a     distracting stumble backwards to their less-rewarding <i>A.M.</i> days.  On the other hand, ""Venus     Stop the Train"" is thoroughly pillaged, changed from the hauntingly spare Tweedy/piano/harmonies take     into a 64-track psychedelic dubfest of string sections and unnecessary organ embellishment, all behind     an uncomfortably greasy vocal performance.</p>
<p>Discussion: So, to analyze the data, it certainly appears that Bennett was not quite the forward-pushing     individual many hypothesized he was for the band.  Comparisons on these two tracks reveal a complacency     with the traditional format of the rock song that may have actually been weighing Wilco down in their     evolution, rather than accelerating it.  Both ""Shakin' Sugar"" and ""Venus"" are also mired in the same     over-overdubbing sludge that kept <i>Summerteeth</i> from being the album to infect the world with     Wilco Fever.  Is a song not complete until it has four keyboards blaring on top of it?</p>
<p>These shortcomings can be expanded to the entirety of <i>The Palace at 4am</i>, explaining the album's     considerable mediocrity.  Bennett and Burch obviously just want to make a rock album, and you can't really     fault them for it.  But while <i>YHF</i> is a classic rock album with grease spots of laptop diddles and     noisy skrawk seeping through, <i>Palace</i> is perhaps more what Reprise was hoping for: FM-ready stuff     that at best resembles Tom Petty and at worst could be mistaken for the Counting Crows.</p>
<p>While there are certainly some good songs to be found (""Whispers or Screams,"" ""Like a Photograph,"" ""Talk to     Me""), most appear to have spent a little too long being kicked around the studio.  The liner notes credit     Bennett with at least nineteen instruments (Burch gets eight), and most songs appear to have utilized each     and every one of 'em: mellotrons, omnichords, orchestral bells, and all.  Most of the layering sounds more     like camouflage than innovation, particularly on the useless remake of <i>Summerteeth</i>'s ""My Darling,""     complete with head-scratchingly superfluous electric sitar and ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" muted     trumpet.</p>
<p>""My Darling"" also highlights why Bennett was restricted to backup vocal duties by his former employer, as     any song that's been previously given a treatment using Tweedy's signature rumpled rasp highlights     unfortunate shortcomings in Bennett's forced-emotion warble.  The excessive length of <i>Palace</i> doesn't help matters either; at nearly seventy minutes, there's far too much filler material diluting     the good stuff.  It's as if, freed from the parental reigns of bandmates, he's lost all sense of tasteful     restraint.</p>
<p>Right: bitch, bitch, bitch, Wilco, Wilco, Wilco.  Can't I examine <i>The Palace at 4am (Part I)</i> on its     own terms?  Well, frankly, no.  Nobody who isn't already a Wilco fan would probably consider buying this     record, and as the above research shows, Bennett himself isn't quite yet out of the band's considerable     shadow (I haven't even mentioned the appearances of Ken Coomer, John Stirratt, or a couple <i>Mermaid Avenue</i> outtakes).  For the same reason, it's probably too soon to tell who'll win the Tweedy-Bennett showdown;     without their former keyboard maestro keeping a rock foundation, Wilco's follow-up to <i>YHF</i> could launch     too far into outer space, and Bennett &amp; Burch supposedly already have a stripped-down version of <i>Palace</i> ready to go (<i>Part II</i>, perhaps?), indicating that Bennett recognizes his tendency to over-tweak.     Bennett's future may not be you-gotta-wear-shades bright, but we probably shouldn't write him off just yet.     Keep in mind that nobody thought Tweedy was the talented Tupelo.</p></div>"|649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/649-the-palace-at-4am-part-i/|5.6|Rob Mitchum

It is the root of development and evolution.  For many artists, it's almost a given that
    what you're playing now will almost certainly not be what you're playing next year.  In fact, part of the
    thrill of following music is wondering what will happen next, who will be the instigator of the next big
    thing, and watching your favorites adapt to the times.  Sometimes, artists change because they're in a rut
    of turning out the same old thing, perhaps losing their grip on relevance (think U2).  The marketing-centric
    ones (Madonna) change before they have a chance to fall into a rut.  Other times, artists change because
    they're genuinely interested in moving on to new things, presumably for the sake of art (like Beck or
    perhaps Radiohead).  Yeah, change is everywhere, and it's good.</p><p>
    On the other hand, change is terrible:</p><p>
<i>""The shadow of his early work will follow him forever.""</i></p><p>
    ""The Sparks also use the old 'between albums EP' cliché to indulge in a little experimentation at their
    fans' expense.""</p><p>
    ""...Maladroit<i> is definitely not a return to the sound of the band's mid-90s artistic peak.""</i></p><p>
    All of these quotes are taken from recent Pitchfork reviews, and illustrate that changing your sound
    guarantees absolutely nothing.  In these cases, it was viewed critically, though it could have been a lot
    worse (think of the mass throttling unleashed with any new John Lydon project-- Jesus, that I have to use
    the term 'project' for Lydon's stuff says it all).  The problem these acts run into is that deviation from
    their once-successful formula has gotten them panned, and since they're still at least partially relevant
    to young listeners, resting on their laurels is practically a sin.</p><p>
    And that brings me to the Reverend Horton Heat.  James C. ""Horton"" Heath is in a real mess.  Thing is,
    having a fairly sizable fan base who expects new product every couple of years is one thing, but what does
    he do when his band excels in a style of music which has remained essentially unchanged in 50 years?  Sure,
    the Reverend's rockabilly stomp runs on a slightly higher octane than Carl Perkins', but rockabilly stomp
    it is, and there's only so many newfangled devices he can work into the show and still have it be good
    old rock 'n' roll.  Don't believe me?  Which album do you think all true-blue Heat fans hate the most?
    Hint: Al Jourgensen does not play rockabilly.</p><p>
    So, where does that leave the band?  From the sound of it, it leaves them (and me) with <i>Lucky 7</i>, and
    14 very (very) slight variations on the devil's music.  Very.  On top of that, I'm not even sure Reverend
    Horton Heat needs to release a whole lot of new material at this point.  They must make most of their living
    by touring, and none of this stuff sounds as good on a CD as it does live anyway.  Of course, to stop
    releasing new stuff is even more a sign of an artist bled dry than refusing to change.  So on with the show.</p><p>
    The opener, ""Loco Gringos Like a Party,"" is a heavy, swinging blues shuffle that, for all intents and
    purposes, has probably written itself.  Down to the detail of ""eating the worm,"" group-shouted backup
    vocals and the part where Heath ""brings it down"" for the solo, every part of this song is constructed to
    lather up a crowd in concert.  It would also work pretty well in a beer commercial.  In fact, here's a
    short list of tunes from this album which you can probably guess the sound of merely by reading their
    titles: ""Like a Rocket"" (up-tempo rockabilly, more beer ad cred than the opener-- it was even chosen as
    the anthem for the 2002 Daytona 500), ""Duel at the Two O'Clock Bell"" (moody surf-cowboy instrumental),
    ""Ain't Gonna Happen"" (thrashy rockabilly, Henry Rollins is loving every minute of both the music and the
    title), ""Suicide Doors"" (more up-tempo rockabilly, about a car), and the goofy ""Sermon on the Jimbo.""
    That last one is a spoken word intro to the closing track wherein Heath reveals the temptations (""playing
    with the poodle"") and saving graces (""the clear waters of his above-ground pool"") of his bassist Jimbo.</p><p>
    It's not all that grimly predictable, though.  ""Galaxy 500"" is a cartoonish lament on an ex-wife, and Heath's
    only request to her is to keep his car.  Musically, it's more punked-out roots-rock, but the band works in a
    few new chord progressions, and even better, actual volume and mood changes.  All in the same song!  ""The
    Tiny Voice of Reason"" is a neat acoustic cowboy ballad with a tender heart.  Most impressive is the deft
    bluegrass-style instrumental, ""Show Pony,"" featuring Heath's considerable guitar-picking talents, and his
    rhythm section at their energetic best.</p><p>
    The good stuff aside, if hard whiskey, hard women and aboveground pools aren't your thing-- and I would
    imagine not-- it's tough to recommend <i>Lucky 7</i>.  I can still see how most of it would work live
    (mostly remembering the incredible show they put on when I saw them years ago in Dallas), so the spirit's
    probably there.  Nothing much has changed for these guys in ten years, and if that doesn't bother you,
    you've got a friend in the Reverend.</p></div>"|6773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6773-lucky-7/|5.8|Dominique Leone

    laboratory electro and a faint whiff of drum-n-bass. Given how connected Tejada is to Plug Research, I
    find it odd that this album is most reminiscent ""Artificial Intelligence""-era Black Dog Productions.</p><p>
    What hallmarks a Tejada production is the intricacy with which he arranges each element of a track. His
    precision is deceptively transparent. It's easy, in fact, to be awed by the overall flow of the track and
    not to pay close attention to how Tejada has put it all together.  A superb example of this is ""Young.""
    The track begins as a Xerox of Friend &amp; Dr. Kosmos' version of the Clash's ""Career Opportunities"" before
    incorporating that signature bassline into what I imagine a Black Dog/Pete Namlook collaboration might
    sound like.  Likewise, the moody ""Shifted"" rejects the jauntiness of the opener, ""To the West,"" thereby
    making an undeniable case for its inclusion in a set by Certificate 18's Norwegian post-drum-n-bass genius,
    Polar.</p><p>
    Occasionally, though, Tejada slips up.  The wistful ""Summer Rain"" sounds weedy and unsure, with a drum
    pattern that offers none of the rhythmic bobbing and weaving I've come to expect from his records.  Yet
    at other times Tejada can be as precise as heat-seeking missile-- ""Rehearsing Disaster,"" for example,
    snatches some of Squarepusher's manic energy and channels it into meticulous rhythmic detailing rather
    than Tom Jenkinson's freaky jumble.</p><p>
    ""Abre Los Ojos""-- no doubt a tribute to Alejandro AmexE1bar's disturbing and provocative film of the same
    title (the one Cameron Crowe neutered for <i>Vanilla Sky</i>)-- features a heavily processed vocal sample
    of Tejada's operatic soprano mom, Carmen.  Fortunately, Tejada doesn't choose the facile route to success
    by turning the track into an Enigma or Enya knock-off, instead threading the modified voice through the
    background out of which acidic squiggles and off-kilter percussion stalk across a mechanoid landscape.</p><p>
    Instrumental hip-hop also creeps into <i>Daydreams in Cold Weather</i>. Tejada's previous album, <i>The
    Matrix of Us</i>, was the first time I'd heard him divert from his abundant love of uncut Detroit techno.
    While <i>The Matrix of Us</i> was no <i>Endtroducing</i>, I found Tejada's application of techno's automated
    sterility to hip-hop fascinating, and Mo'Wax's mystic tongue Divine Styler added hugely to the success of
    the endeavor. Divine Styler returns here to give his cool power to ""The Silence of Us""-- a deliberation on
    inexpressible realities.</p><p>
    While I can find little to fault <i>Daydreams in Cold Weather</i>, I must say that I expected more from
    Tejada's first appearance on Plug Research. This isn't so much an indictment of Tejada, more a testament to
    the originality that Plug Research artists usually provide in spades. Rumor has it that the forthcoming
    Low Res album, <i>Blue Ramen</i>, will blow minds just as Daedelus' <i>Invention</i> and Dntel's <i>Life
    Is Full of Possibilities</i> have unequivocally done.  Here's hoping that <i>Daydreams in Cold Weather</i>
    is Tejada setting up base camp before joining the others on their pioneering excursions beyond conformity
    and into innovation.</p></div>"|7960.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7960-daydreams-in-cold-weather/|6.7|Paul Cooper

    blue jeans, skinny ties, and bright red lipstick gathered for one final night to raise hell with hard liquor
    and filtered cigarettes, and bid farewell to the garage/surf revival that had sustained them. When the
    evening was over, the crowd dispersed via classic car or motorcycle, or passed out cold in the gravel
    parking lot. The last word came from a staggering DJ, who, while clumsily loading old Sonics albums into
    the back of his vintage Camaro, reputedly uttered: ""They say electronica is the next big thing. I guess
    that's the end of us.""</p><p>
    
    Many of the evening's attendees took this prophetic line too much to heart, and went home to sell their
    guitars and invest in expensive music software.  Or in the case of Spokane, Washington's The Makers, grew
    out their hair, changed their names, and started talking concept albums.</p><p>
    
    As it happened, the whole 'garage rock is dead' bit was at best a gross exaggeration, or at worst a vicious
    rumor started by an enterprising couple from Detroit who aimed to capitalize on the gullibility of their
    peers. It's no secret that anything bearing a remote resemblance to garage rock is <i>huge</i> right now,
    and despite marginal accolades for their new, improved glam rock personas, The Makers got the shit end of
    the deal.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us, in a round about way, to <i>Strangest Parade</i>. A flawed follow-up to the flawed concept
    album that was the preceding <i>Rock Star God</i>, <i>Strangest Parade</i> shows the Makers 'maturing' from
    full-on glam rock excess into ordinary rock excess with little of the attitude, and less of the energy, that
    made them even remotely appealing in the first place. Yes, it's dark and serious and musically competent,
    but why should that be a recommendation of a band once known for their snarling, no-holds-barred noise and
    the somewhat mythical badassitude they derived from their skid row storyline and predilection for onstage
    anarchy. The only evidence of a sense of fun or humor on this album are the band's clothes, which, if the
    album cover's any indication, may have been purchased at a combination Rod Stewart/Queen garage sale circa '77.</p><p>
<i>Strangest Parade</i> is basically devised as a two-part concept album, separated into a long first half
    and a shorter second half by two short creatively titled introductions (respectively ""An Eternal Climb"" and
    ""Death and the Mad Heroine""), and a simplistic stylistic division-- the first part tends to drag anthemically;
    the second half comes closer to straightforward rock 'n' roll. The album is set up as a mock concert,
    concluding with ""Wide Wide World of Girls""-- a largely acoustic, almost Neil Young-inspired ballad complete
    with harmonica, dobro, and twang-- an interactive encore, wherein the music is overlaid with periodic
    stadium-sized audience applause and band introduction.</p><p>
    
    Though this conceit irritates me as a rule, it's only a mild violation when compared to the over-the-top
    Bowie-aping that dominates the bulk of the album.  With moments of cribbed ""Space Oddity"" (the acoustic
    segue ""Wild Gray Wonder"") and such blatant examples of ersatz Ziggy Stardust as the anthemic ""Calling Elvis,
    John and Jesus"" with its falsetto backup choirs and spacy guitar lines, or the whacked out confessional
    piano ballad ""Calling My Name,"" it's awfully hard to lend them credence that they're anything other than a
    veiled tribute band-- let alone that they <i>wrote</i> these songs.</p><p>
    
    The best moments on the album recall The Makers' more raucous past. Sometimes these occur almost inconspicuously:
    the unabashed crunch of the guitar on parts of ""Hard to Be Human,"" is nearly lost in the glam theatrics and
    sound effects.  Likewise, the great <i>Nuggets</i>-era pop of ""Suicide Blues"" is hampered by the bizarre
    inclusion of what sounds like a children's choir at the chorus. Other tracks show the initial energy of what
    could be wild ass rock 'n' roll (the build-up alone on ""Addicted to Dying"" raised my heart rate), but draw
    back abruptly as if weighted by the maintenance of the album's conceit.</p><p>
    
    I respect The Makers' desire to grow and evolve as musicians, even if-- in fact, <i>especially</i> if-- it
    seems both aesthetically and economically ill-advised to do so.  But ask yourself: do we really need another
    uninspired T.Rex retread, and if so, do you really want the Makers to be the ones doing it?  Me neither.</p></div>"|5055.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5055-strangest-parade/|3.5|Alison Fields

    mindless or otherwise, so gimme back my Guided by Voices pogs.""  Now, David Hume was an intelligent man,
    but does that really claim have anything to do with music?  Well, maybe a little (though he might not have
    intended it to), since it pretty much sums up the entire justification for all things pop since Haydn's
    final symphony, ""Girls are Neat, in D Minor.""  It has spawned the often dreadful 'mindless fun' defense,
    going to win innumerable precedents in the court of public opinion.  Certainly, some of the records defended
    by this argument are triumphs, but for every Daft Punk, there's an O.J.-style travesty like <i>I Get Wet</i>
    that's just waiting to trot out the same brainless defense.  So, Dave, mindless fun may be all well and good,
    like underage drinking (hilarious), but it can get out of hand, like being arrested for Heroin possession
    (still funny, but only if it's not me).  When that time comes, in the equally classic words of Abe Lincoln,
    ""the hammer's gotta come down.""</p><p>
    
    Oh, hey, Arlo!  I was just talking about you.  <i>Stab the Unstoppable Hero</i>, the second outing from this
    L.A. four-piece, is numbingly catchy, and with lyrics like, ""Are you made of salt?/ Or are you sour?/ Do you
    fall apart/ In the shower?,"" no one's going to nominate a song like ""Little American"" for the new Mensa theme.
    Yeah, Arlo's newest chunky, garage-style mess has the nature of pure power-pop and the hooks to ensure that
    no brain cells get out alive.  Often, it can play almost as well as Weezer, or, more commonly, Walt Mink,
    but... goddammit, here's where the principles have to come in.</p><p>
    
    Did I say like Mink or the Weez?  Yep.  Arlo reads right off their script-- and the script of every other
    garage-pop act in the last decade, for that matter-- they're just not quite up to the part.  For roughly
    75% of this album, Arlo is content to show off its best impression of much better bands, and, to be fair,
    it can be a fairly slick impersonation.  I mean, Riv Cuomo hasn't penned a song as innocent or apparently
    effortless as ""Too Sick to Tango"" or ""Linger On"" in two albums, and yet, somehow <i>Stab</i> still isn't any
    fun.  The problem is, where this album ought to have the sweet consistency of bubblegum there's nothing but
    the acidic taste of blatant, heavy-handed derivation.</p><p>
    
    ""Working Title"" could blend in seamlessly with any of the outtakes from the <i>Miss Happiness</i> sessions--
    there's not an ounce of invention in it.  Likewise, the streamlined guitar fuzz and soaring harmonies of
    ""Temperature"" are easy on the ears, but even that was done a hell of a lot better on <i>El Producto</i>.  So
    why bother?  It's a question of craftsmanship versus straight sonics, and the fine line between influence and
    rip-off is crossed here throughout.  Hell, the White Stripes haven't played a single glorious note that hasn't
    been found elsewhere, but no one could sensibly accuse them of shoplifting from influences like Zep and, you
    know, all blues ever written.  I'm not saying that of Arlo, either, but they'd have a much harder time
    clearing themselves if that was the charge.</p><p>
    
    Let me be direct: when Arlo are wearing their masks, they may sound derivative, but at least they sound pretty
    good; they're taking cues from some great acts, after all.  And as much of a difficulty as it is, it's better
    than the alternative.  Sadly, for about a quarter of this farce, Arlo sounds like plain old Arlo, and I'll
    tell you, that's a prospect that won't be well-received.  The most original shots they've got in them are
    muddy barrages that lean more towards grunge sludge (""Runaround"") or limp-wristed alt-country (""Up""), songs
    notable only for their absolute nondescriptness and predictability.  <i>Stab the Unstoppable Hero</i> even
    contains the single most obvious ""we're rocking so hard that we can't even play the music properly"" outro
    in recent memory.  Though, to their credit, at least it sounds like they wrote it.</p><p>
    
    This album is just one more round in the inevitable victory of nature over principles-- it's not easy to
    resist some of the more entertaining pop kernels lingering on <i>Stab the Unstoppable Hero</i>.  Which is
    a real shame.  Hume might not have known what he was excusing, but that doesn't mean that this sort of pap
    can slide.  These songs were written on tracing paper, leading to some amazingly troubling pop.  Oh, and I
    guess since 'troubling pop' isn't a phrase that's likely to see much use, Arlo might be notable for that,
    too.</p></div>"|289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/289-stab-the-unstoppable-hero/|3.8|Eric Carr

    piece that crystallizes the ideas behind minimalism. ""In C"" also sits at a
    fulcrum in the development of the movement. Riley considered his work as an
    extension of the ideas of LaMonte Young (Riley focused on repetition instead
    of sustained tones), and Steve Reich was one of the musicians for the initial
    performance in San Francisco in 1964 (Reich says now that his involvement
    with Riley in 1964 planted the seeds that developed into ""It's Gonna Rain"").
    ""In C"" is open-ended, in the sense that any number of instruments can be used,
    and a performance can last indefinitely. The piece is constructed from a number
    of short, repeating melodic phrases that can overlap or be extended at the
    discretion of the players; what is always constant is the key of the piece,
    and a repeating high C that provides the rhythmic foundation.</p><p>
    
    ""In C"" been recorded many times since 1964 in many different ways, but never
    quite like this. There is something so right about the idea that a group of
    superpsychedelic rock freaks would take on a composition from the minimalist
    canon. Acid Mothers Temple is the perfect band for the job, enamored as they
    are with the spirit of the 60s and the quest for the cosmic vibration (Riley
    has said that ""In C"" grew out of his interest in psychedelics.) It's telling
    that the inside cover of this release is a panoramic shot of Kawabata Makoto
    spreading his arms in front of Stonehenge. Aside from the heartening Spinal
    Tap associations, Acid Mothers Temple do indeed tune into something ""out
    there"" and work some magic on ""In C.""</p><p>
    
    AMT's version of the Riley piece starts very slow and quiet, with a tempo
    dramatically pitched down from a typical classical version. The root C is
    played on a vibraphone throughout, and as the track warms up, just the vibes
    and a droning organ outline the tune. The first three minutes or so are
    meditative and beautiful, as the single note and spare harmonies coalesce
    into a gentle swirl of sound. Then, from beneath the calm a gradually
    building herd of drums creep into the frame. Once the drums reach full
    volume, they become the motivating force of the track, the pace quickens,
    and ""In C"" turns into a rollicking, endless jam.</p><p>
    
    Though the sounds appropriately bleed together into a single pulsating
    cluster, Terukina Noriko's incredible work on vibes and glockenspiel remain
    the discernable element throughout. Her tone is reminiscent of steel drums
    as she finds endless variations on the simple themes. The other instruments
    are difficult to identify-- it sounds like assorted synthesizers and
    perhaps a sitar. If Makoto is playing his guitar, he is seriously altering
    the tone. But this jam is all about the collective, and it remains intense
    and exciting throughout its 20-minute length.</p><p>
    
    The Acid Mothers Temple original ""In E"" comes next (har har), and it's
    almost as impressive. Opening with a thick, oozing synthesizer drone,
    Makoto's guitar strums eventually become the focus. An open E chord provides
    the heavy bottom for the ensuing jam, as he drives home a slashing ""Sister
    Ray""-style riff for 16+ minutes.  This is Acid Mothers Temple finding
    where early-70s Detroit intersected with Krautrock. It's a thrilling piece
    of psychedelia that, with its more focused riffage, outperforms anything
    on last year's <i>New Geocentric World</i>.</p><p>
    
    The CD-only bonus track ""In D"" closes out the album with a thick, balmy
    drone that shifts gradually over the course of 20 minutes. There is no
    noise here, and no drums; in fact, if it weren't for the Far East buzz of an
    unidentifiable instrument, ""In D"" could pass as a fine Windy &amp; Carl track,
    evoking images of a naturalistic trance state imbued with sunlight and
    billowy clouds. It's a perfect compliment to the two tracks that precede it,
    and a fine way to close this exceptional record. Terry's not very into the
    noisy stuff these days, so I'm not sure he approves. But to my ears, AMT
    more than honors his legacy.</p></div>"|21.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21-in-c/|8.2|Mark Richard-San

    establishing itself as the epicenter of post-millennial hip hop.  After Rjd2 dropped the superb
    <i>I Really Like Your Def Jux Baby Tee</i> earlier this year, a steady buzz began to
    build that <i>Deadringer</i> would be the next step in instrumental, sample-based hip-hop.  Def Jux guru
    El-P even declared that this record will ""change the motherfuckin' world.""  Heads began to salivate with
    expectations of a terse, discordant soundscape that mingled the cinematic glory of DJ Shadow with the
    decidedly subterranean grime of the other Def Jux releases. It seemed to be a marriage made in heaven,
    albeit a particularly dark and confusing corner of God's kingdom.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps you should brace yourself before sliding this particular slab of vinyl onto the decks. While the
    Shadow influence is evident throughout the album, <i>Deadringer</i> sounds absolutely nothing like anything
    else on Def Jux.  It's funky, soulful and seems to draw more from The Beatles than it does Skinny Puppy.
    That's not to say that there aren't dark moments on <i>Deadringer</i>, but that Rjd2 maintains a stylistic
    consistency while oscillating emotions and moods at the drop of a hat, and that its ability to capture the
    various hues that comprise life's mosaic is a rare thing to find in today's music.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""The Horror"" kicks off with a jolting chorus of horns before quickly fading into a grandiose,
    cheeky sci-fi sample that sounds more playful than menacing. A flanged voice declares, ""It's time,
    time, time to understand the horror... It's time, time, time to understand the monster.""  These light,
    almost teasing moments, which are liberally sprinkled throughout the album, keep Rjd2's soundscapes
    from veering too closely into Shadow territory and help this album overcome the generally monotony of
    most music being labeled 'cinematic.'</p><p>
    
    But if you think you've got this record's number already, think again: ""Smoke and Mirrors"" totally flips
    the script.  It's bluesy, eerily reminiscent of the cold psychedelia laid out by early Pink Floyd. After
    a raucous intro, a throaty voice pops in and sings, ""Who knows what tomorrow will bring, maybe sunshine,
    maybe rain... maybe it'll bring my love to me.""  And while the track initially comes across as simplistic
    and retro, the subtleties of its execution are complex, transcending the genres that inform it.</p><p>
    
    Other strains of psychedelia can be heard throughout this album.  ""Ghostwriter,"" with its light, shimmering
    guitar work, alternating samples of 'mmms' and 'ahhs,' and chorus of triumphant horns, recalls the joyful
    loopiness that defined the best psych-pop of the mid-60s.  The song's final joyful burst is so sublime that
    it alone justifies purchasing this album.</p><p>
    
    ""Final Frontier"" and ""F.F.H."" prove that Rjd2, who got his start doing the production work for the MHZ crew,
    can still back up an emcee.  Unlike other producer wunderkinds, Rjd2 never allows the production to
    overwhelm the vocalist, and as a result, both tracks are highly effective.  But the symbiotic dynamic
    between producer and emcee is most evident in the incredible ""June."" The production seems understated and
    almost ordinary as Copywrite spits his verse, but in the long break between the first and second verses the
    hypnotic brilliance of the track crystallizes.  The interplay between the flamenco guitar, ringing synth,
    and shuffling breakbeat is transporting.  And how the music drops before Copywrite comes with his second
    verse is a minor but brilliant touch.</p><p>
    
    But <i>Deadringer</i>'s real jewel comes after the album is officially over.  While hidden tracks tend to
    be gimmicky clunkers, this is a diaphanous slab of soul.  The brief, simple sample that anchors the track
    is both melancholic and resilient.  A smoky yet smooth vocal sample declares, ""You are gone, I'm so all
    alone... as I stare at the ceiling."" It's a rare display of emotional transparency in hip-hop, although it
    would be a bit unfair to classify <i>Deadringer</i> as strictly hip-hop.</p><p>
    
    There are a few missteps.  While Rjd2 inarguably brings the heat with ""The Chicken Bone Circuit,"" the track's
    breakbeats-on-steroids drums and haunting, minimalist piano sample too closely approximate DJ Shadow.  ""The
    Proxy"" might serve as a standout track for those who enjoyed Bundy K Brown and Jim O'Rourke's remixes on The
    Sea &amp; Cake's <i>Two Gentlemen</i> EP, but it's a bit too lite for my tastes.  Still, for every instance that
    the disc threatens to blatantly parody Shadow or descend into the impish, commercialized world of Moby, Rjd2
    tweaks a sample and drops a beat that makes your heart palpitate. While it's doubtful that this album will
    ""change the motherfucking world,"" or even the landscape of hip-hop, Rjd2 has managed to perfect his certain
    brand of sampling, making <i>Deadringer</i> an essential purchase for any fan of instrumental hip-hop.</p></div>"|6797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6797-deadringer/|8.8|Sam Chennault

In the mid-90s, Nation of Ulysses guitarist Tim Green
    joined forces with sympathetic San Francisco souls Tim Soete and Josh Smith (who
    has been known to shred a few with über-black metal outfit Weakling), and
    immediately commenced to answer the question of what happens when you combine the
    strengths of Iron Maiden, Metallica and King Crimson and thrust that ornery beast
    upon indie rock audiences.  The guys' first releases were independent cassettes,
    recorded as The Champs, which were available only at live shows.  Soon after, they
    were pressured to change the bandname by the 60s group of the same name who'd had
    a hit with ""Tequila,"" so they opted instead to be known as C4AM95.</p><p>
    C4AM95's first official full-length, the double-album <i>III</i>, hit stores in
    1997 on Frenetic Records, and witnessed an already fully developed band at the
    height of their powers dropping not only mind-numbing cock-prog adventures, but
    also a few electronic vignettes that might not have sounded out of place on the
    <i>Flash Gordon</i> soundtrack.  2000's <i>IV</i> cut the length in half, but
    retained the concept entirely-- and it only won them more props.</p><p>
    So, in the grand album tradition of Led Zeppelin and, well, Chicago, we now have
    <i>V</i>.  The good news: nothing has changed; the bad news: uh, you like
    prog-metal, right?  Hey, it could be worse (two words: Dream Theater).  Besides,
    I defy anyone to find an ounce of pretension or bloated self-indulgence on this
    record.  Wanky?  Maybe, but probably less so than recent collaborators Trans Am,
    and anyway, the Fucking Champs own pretty much everyone in the super-rock department.
    There's a school of thought that says you have to make excuses for listening to
    stuff like this, but that kind of bullshit comes up limp in the face of the Champs'
    ability to ram a riff down your throat, not to mention their sheer sincerity.</p><p>
    The two-part ""Never Enough Neck"" starts things off subtly, with a soft synth
    chord that crescendos into the crashing, distorted drums and guitars.  They
    hit riffs one right after another, the tempo relentlessly quick and drummer
    Soete's dexterity stunning.  The first part of the tune is fairly melodic, if
    full of typical Champs' crunch; the second switches up to a decidedly proggy
    tip, odd time signatures and all.</p><p>
    The majestic (or as much as can be said of this band) ""Children Perceive the
    Hoax Cluster"" is actually a live track, replete with drunken screams and
    featuring Smith's considerable synthesizer atmospherics.  The track forgoes
    percussive fury in lieu of pure 80s sci-fi mysticism (remember <i>Ladyhawke</i>?).
    This leads directly into another 80s trip, ""I Am the Album Cover,"" which is
    something like the shameful instrumental meeting of Iron Maiden and Survivor.
    To my ears, even though that kind of stuff might get the Champs' more press, I
    think it could potentially lead to novelty-band status.  The track sounds like
    it may have been an old four-track experiment (the music on this disc dates as
    far back as '93), so maybe they're focusing on a more idiosyncratic sound now.</p><p>
    The best tracks on <i>V</i> are the ones that throw caution and 80s kitsch out
    the window in favor of chops-ahoy-- like the up-tempo ""Happy Segovia,"" or the
    epic ""Aliens of Gold,"" which may be the best-ever example of trying to fuse
    the words 'prog' and 'metal,' while never uttering the word 'sux.'  And yes,
    there is a metal version of a Bach tune here (\xA91723, so say the liner notes),
    so I suppose even the Fucking Champs aren't above the occasional Spinal Tap
    move.  But you know, it fits right in with the other stuff.  So I guess the
    moral is that if a band is good enough, plays hard enough, and does it without
    the slightest hint of irony, they can find people who'll love them regardless
    of the genre.  Either that, or resurrecting the ghost of Randy Rhoads is the
    magic formula for making cool records.  What do you think?</p></div>"|3238.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3238-v/|8.1|Dominique Leone

    The Dream of Evan and Chan</i>, could so easily have been in jeopardy. Allowing remix talent free rein on
    this resplendent jewel puts all I love about it in serious peril. What might ham-fisted, greenback-grubbing
    remixers do to the melancholy, glitch-inflected pop of Jimmy Tamborello and guest vocalist Ben Gibbard of
    Death Cab for Cutie?</p><p>
    I need not have feared, as Plug Research has commissioned remixes from artists largely in harmony with
    Tamborello's aesthetic. The downside of that ploy is that I'm not much struck by the somewhat obvious
    choice of artists here.  What would Coil have made of this fractured-beat pop?  How about a Vladislav Delay
    overhaul?  Not that those whom Plug Research chose to retool these songs disgrace themselves or trash the
    songs at all; it's just that some variety might be a nice change-up from these indie remix releases.</p><p>
    Plug Research's own Safety Scissors takes the first swing and almost hits the song out of the park, toughening
    up the winsome accompaniment of the original by spiking the song with electro stabs and squiggles. Safety
    Scissors has a similarly brusque manner when it comes to Gibbard's performance and the lyrics he sings. In
    fact, he does away with Gibbard entirely and replaces him with Erlend Øye of Kings of Convenience-- and in
    homage to Safety Scissors' treatment of Gibbard, Øye feels at liberty to rewrite the lyrics. The nostalgia
    of the original remains, but now it's bolstered by an awkward gruffness.</p><p>
    Barbara Morgenstern, stalwart of the Germany-based Monika label, chooses to leave the instrumental track
    pretty much untinkered with, save the addition of a church organ to heap on a doomy ambience. Her remix,
    such as it is, turns the song into a duet.  Her vocals closely track Gibbard's, adding only a hint of the
    melismatics that might earn her a spot in the opening rounds of the next ""American Idol"" competition.</p><p>
    The big room remix is Superpitcher, who recasts the song as an eight-minute lo-fi house track.  He abides
    by the axiom that the most memorable house and disco has an air of true melancholy. Fortunately, ""(This Is)
    The Dream of Evan and Chan"" has plenty of that. Atop the four-to-the-floor glory, Superpitcher sprinkles some
    grubby flecks of distortion.  Then, after a massive peal of bells, he removes all percussion and bass throbs,
    before finally lending an Astrobotnia vibe to the mix by sliding in a ghostly countermelody that wisps past
    Gibbard's repeats of ""ringing, ringing, ring off.""  Of all the mixes on this disc, this is the one that will
    attract new comers to Dntel.</p><p>
    The fourth and final attempt at adhering to the remixer's Hippocratic Oath (""do no harm"") is Lali Puna's
    instrumental mix. While the duo does no irreparable damage, they don't do much good with their instrumental
    mix, either.  Much of the charm of the original song lies in Gibbard's fey delivery of the curious melody.
    Markus Acher and Valerie Trebeljahr substitute that curious but eminently hummable tune with a more meandering
    alternative. As they proved with their album <i>Scary World Theory</i>, Lali Puna are capable of bringing
    more hooks out of the vaults than Home Depot shelfstockers. But for this remix, they've wandered <i>past</i>
    those vaults and into the cold storage lockers where they keep dreary junk they haven't yet parted with.  I
    do note, however, that this remix deflects any criticism that Lali Puna are mere slavish Two Lone Swordsmen
    copyists. This click-scuffed remix could seamlessly appear on one of Jan Jelinek's ~scape compilations.</p><p>
    A new song titled ""The Hill"" is included here as a bonus, with Tamborello assuming vocal duties. While the
    track is certainly no equal of ""Evan and Chan"" in unabashed charm, Tamborello does manage to match its
    nostalgia. Over layers of accordions and thoroughbred busted beats, he advises the listener, ""Slide down
    your hill/ Until you remember how fun it was/ When you were young/ And don't forget to keep it with you when
    our time is over/ The alarm bell's rung and the week's begun.""  ""The Hill"" restates the obvious fact that
    none of us is getting any younger, but reinforces that that doesn't mean we're destined to become crotchety
    gits. In fact, absorption of this single and the album that spawned it will nigh on guarantee you youthful
    vigor and sentiment long after you've made that devastating jump to disposable underwear.</p></div>"|2396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2396-this-is-the-dream-of-evan-and-chan-ep/|7.0|Paul Cooper

There used to be a time when their aggressive, thundering riffs could
    crush your puny skull like so many eggshells and pull your very soul beneath the remains.  Of course, they
    formed in the mid-80s, so maybe Belo Horizonte's favorite sons figured it was time to move on to new things,
    like, say, screamo and punk.  Suffice to say, this new EP does not sound like the same band responsible for
    metal classics like ""Slave New World"" and ""Bestial Devastation.""</p><p>
    
    But wait-- what's North of America?  Wasn't that a Slayer album?  Ahh, shit.  This isn't Sepultura!  Well,
    now it's all coming together.  Turns out, the <i>band</i> is North of America, and <i>The Sepultura</i> is
    just the title this new EP.  How stupid of me.  Well, if I've got my Latin roots down (and I don't), I'm
    thinking that the word 'sepultura' has something to do with burial.  And I'm thinking that North of America
    is just a not-so-clever way of saying 'Canada.'  And as it turns out, that's correct-- the quartet hails
    from Halifax, Nova Scotia, best known in the record business as the home of power-pop all-stars Sloan, also
    known as the Other Canadian Beatles (first honors go to Klaatu).</p><p>
    
    Despite geographic resemblance, though, North of America's music has really nothing to do with either that
    of Sloan's or Klaatu's.  North of America came together during the initial ramping phase of Millennial fever
    in 1998, releasing an EP almost immediately and following it with two full-lengths in 1999 and 2001.  Yet
    for all the work they have behind them, <i>The Sepultura</i> paints a picture more similar to that of a band
    just starting out.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps it's just the vocals that make it seem that way.  Scratch that-- it's definitely the vocals.  This
    EP's six songs are packed with the petulant screaming that's turned so-called 'screamo' into such a
    self-parody over the years.  Singing?  Well, perhaps once in a while they'll settle down for a nice little
    melodic passage, but it always leads back to the yelling.  It's like one side of an argument from the
    downstairs apartment.</p><p>
    
    The production doesn't help this sense of a band getting on its feet much, either.  There's no space in the
    mix whatsoever, even when there's admirable space in the playing itself, and every song is basically the
    same color.  Between the lack of differentiation between instruments in the production and the near total
    lack of strong vocal melodies, songs tend to blur together, relying largely on the generous instrumental
    passages that inhabit them to help them make their individual marks.</p><p>
    
    Instrumentally speaking, though, these guys are hot.  They can clearly play, and they've got rhythm for miles.
    The bass tone is thick and heavy, ballasting every flailing note and dissonant chord the guitars can muster.
    The drums play through patterns as frequently as they play straight beats, lending a great deal of complexity
    to everything the band plays.  ""Destroy Tambourine"" opens with drums charging through a forest of nasty riffs
    and guitar harmonics, and thrashes toward its fire-breathing instrumental bridge, built on a pummeling
    bassline and frenzied percussion.</p><p>
    
    ""Back Stabbath"" similarly kicks the door open, only to temper itself slightly with a downward tempo shift,
    though the instrumental assault never truly lets up.  By the song's conclusion, it's changed completely,
    with the band beating out a relentless rhythm in complete unison.  The most conventionally conceived song
    is ""That's a Convincing Argument, Michael,"" which restrains the shouting more than any other song here.
    The density of the guitar attack actually lets up somewhat in the verses to give the vocals some room, and
    the band shoves the pedal through the floor on the sung/shouted chorus.</p><p>
    
    The song that shows the most depth and adventurousness, though, is the eight-minute closer ""Font Crimes.""
    Beginning quietly with just a complex bassline, the rest of the band soon rains down intertwining guitar
    parts and thundering drums.  The first verse is accompanies only by tribal drumming, though everything else
    crashes back in soon enough.  The lengthy coda heads off into quieter, subtler territory, allowing the bass
    to guide as the cymbals mutate into a lo-fi wash and the guitars settle into oddball ostionatos.</p><p>
    
    So, regardless of whether or not it has anything to do with the band of the same name, <i>The Sepultura</i>
    is a dense, aggressive, and even occasionally challenging release.  It suffers from some fairly common
    musical ailments-- namely sameness and amateurish vocalness-- but even while these details detract, the
    overall picture is still something to look at.</p></div>"|5839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5839-the-sepultura-ep/|6.9|Joe Tangari

    Soderbergh, Jah Wobble has stamped his name on it.  Well, naturally.  Wobble has again collared four of his
    reliable old collaborators, keyboardist Harold Budd (from Wobble's Deep Space outfit), cornet-player Graham
    Haynes and basshead and producer Bill Laswell (both most recently visible on the Laswell/Wobble <i>Radioaxiom</i>
    album) and former Can skin-botherer Jaki Liebezeit, who appears sporadically throughout the Wobble discography.</p><p>
    
    From this familiar quintet issues forth quite unexpected music. I'm used to Wobble experimenting with world
    music-- his output is replete with Japanese shakuhatchis, Cretan flutes, and various earthen drums. The
    <i>Solaris</i> project, however, opts to explore turbulent inner worlds, the vast distances that Tangerine
    Dream surveyed with their <i>Zeit</i> album, but with the roiling maniac intensity of Ash Ra Tempel's
    self-titled debut album.</p><p>
    
    That these four tracks were recorded live offers the listener an opportunity to hear this quintet in the raw,
    without the safety net of a producer demanding a retake.  As such, each member has seized the opportunity to
    kick their performances up several notches, all playing beyond my perceived limits of their abilities. For
    example, until now I have never fathomed what's so appealing about Graham Haynes' cornet-playing. In each
    setting I've heard it, it's struck me as more than just a little derivative of Jon Hassell's FX-textured
    horn work, merely adding a dull synthetic color to the other instruments.  But here, Haynes has toughened
    up his sound, as though he's absorbed the fury and delicacy which British free-jazz luminary Evan Parker
    brought to <i>Passage to Hades</i>. Two-thirds of the way through the 20-minute opening track, ""The Mystery
    of Twilight, Pt 1,"" I can believe that Haynes is channeling <i>Dark Magus</i>-era Miles, playing with a
    conviction and intensity he has never shown in the studio.</p><p>
    
    Though Haynes surprises me, the real revelation on Jah Wobble's <i>Solaris: Live in Concert</i> is pianist
    Harold Budd. Regarded as the connoisseur's George Winston, Budd memorably collaborated with Brian Eno on
    <i>Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirrors</i> and with the Cocteau Twins for <i>The Moon and the Melodies</i>.
    His heavily echoed and treated piano style never struck me as anything but decoratively and offensively
    pleasant. Whatever pill Wobble forced down Budd's throat on this night worked its magic brilliantly.</p><p>
    
    In place of tinkling arpeggios, Budd transforms his piano and keyboards into a mutant army of squalls and
    blasts determined to annihilate all traces of delicacy. During the opening track, Budd's keyboard attacks
    actually resemble Eddie Hazel's jaw-dropping solo during Funkadelic's ""Maggot Brain""!  And his battalions
    don't take prisoners, either. I've never heard Jaki Liebezeit so abused. Budd directs the majority of his
    energies to smothering Liebezeit's metronomic beats, and how refreshing it is to hear Liebezeit so oppressed.
    I've grown pretty tired of hearing the former Can drummer treated so reverently; whatever he had going on
    in the 70s has long-since departed.  Witness his incredibly mundane work on Burnt Friedmann's <i>Playing
    Secret Rhythms</i> or Club Off Chaos' records if you need evidence.</p><p>
    
    Liebezeit sounds baffled by the treatment and metronomes, as if ignoring the ceaseless waves of Budd's
    kamikaze warriors will make them disappear. Only during the final track, ""Around the Lake,"" does Liebezeit
    find some energy to retaliate. But he knows not to pick on the vastly superior Budd; thus, his stick work
    stutters around Laswell's stentorian and untroubled bass figure. The listener witnesses a convergence of
    irresistible force and immovable object until, when ten minutes into the track, Budd's keyboard impersonates
    Terry Riley's ""A Rainbow in Curved Air."" Bass and drums lay back to watch Budd's intricate balletic melodies
    dance like deliriously destructive Shiva.</p><p>
    
    Laswell stands tough throughout <i>Solaris</i>. His fuzzed-out bass is reminiscent of his work with
    Painkiller, the avant-jazz/death-metal that also featured Scorn and Napalm Death's Mick Harris, as well as
    John Zorn. The shortest track here, ""Seven Dials,"" finds Laswell's bass trading jabs with Haynes' cornet
    (no contest, by the way-- Haynes doesn't last three minutes). However, Budd mocks Laswell's victory with
    twee tinkling bells that dance around his lumbering bass.</p><p>
    
    So where's Wobble?  His pure-tone bass is almost unnoticeably present.  Most prominent on ""The Mystery of
    Twilight, Pt 2,"" he sounds less like Robbie Shakespeare and more like Mahavishnu Orchestra's Rick Laird.
    Across the four tracks, Wobble acts as the ground from which the other musicians ferociously emerge. Having
    given his name prominence in the title, Wobble demurely retreats into inconspicuousness. Not even
    appropriating the guise of master of puppets, Wobble becomes the catalyst by which the other reactants burn
    fearsomely bright and scorch the listener with their unbridled audacity.</p></div>"|8722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8722-solaris-live-in-concert/|8.3|Paul Cooper

Web
    details on The Books are sketchy, but I have ascertained that they're a duo consisting of guitarist Nick
    Zammuto, who lives in North Carolina and has released some solo material under his surname, and cellist
    Paul de Jong, who lives in New York and has composed for dance, theater and film. After that, the pool of
    Books information dries up fast. The music is similarly unknowable, in the sense that it's difficult to
    classify. Musicians famously hate to be 'put into a box'; well, if more bands sounded quite as original
    as The Books, the practice would likely cease. If this record is the product of any sort of 'scene,' it's
    not one I've heard of. <i>Thought for Food</i> is going to sit comfortably in my collection in its own
    little category, a small world unto itself.</p><p>
    
    Despite <i>Thought for Food</i>'s unique sound, the record, on one level, is not hard to pin down. The
    musical elements are so simple and commonplace that describing them is not a problem. What's difficult
    is conveying how these few everyday pieces are placed together so artfully to create something this
    striking and unique. I'll give that a shot later, but first-- what sort of music are we talking about
    here? Essentially, three different things go into nearly every Books song: there is always a guitar,
    usually acoustic; there is usually a stringed instrument, either cello or violin or both; and there are
    always sampled vocal fragments. That's basically it. Two tracks have a few bars of soft singing, while
    another, ""Mikey Bass,"" has some bass work by a guy named Mikey. Sporadic percussion and a few other
    instruments are scattered here and there, but the guitar/strings/samples troika is the meat of The Books.
    These three instruments are recorded and then cut up and arranged via computer.</p><p>
    
    Sounds boring, you say? Think again. Somehow, The Books manage to turn these meager components into something
    touching, quirky and profound. The fact that vocal samples (which we can all agree have been done to death)
    sound new again here is nothing short of amazing. I'm not completely sure how they do it, though I know that
    the unusual amount of empty space in this record is part of it. While the rule of thumb for music with a
    collage approach has always been to stuff the samples into every nook and cranny, The Books let all the
    sounds breathe. In addition to the folky guitar, strings and the voice samples, silence is really the fourth
    primary instrument.</p><p>
    
    Another great thing about the record is the way the samples, though they at first seem random, manage to
    tell a story. ""Read, Eat, Sleep"" contains slow guitar plucking that alternates between two chords and some
    gentle, bell-like synth accents. Over the barely-there musical backing, voices spell out ""r-e-a-d- e-a-t-
    s-l-e-e-p"" as distant sound effects appear. As the track winds down, different voices start repeating
    various pronunciations of the word ""aleatoric.""  Finally, the main voice, which sounds like it could be
    the host of a spelling bee, clarifies: ""By digitizing thunder and traffic noises, Georgia was able to
    compose aleatoric music."" Ah, yes, aleatoric, a word meaning composition by use of chance. As he speaks
    his final word, the last ring of the guitar fades out, and you realize that the sampled dialog had been
    describing the process of the track as it unfolded.</p><p>
    
    ""Contempt"" references the Jean-Luc Godard film of the same name.  It contains a measured exchange between
    two men, with one asking the other the questions Brigitte Bardot asked her husband in the film:  ""What about
    my ankles, do you like them?"" and ""My thighs... do you think they're pretty?""  Recontextualized here, the
    song takes on humorous overtones, as the men seem relaxed and speak slowly as if they're engaged in a job
    interview.  The musical accompaniment to this dialog is a swaying waltz-time duet between plucked guitar and
    slightly screechy violin, and the tension that builds through the track is palpable.</p><p>
    
    ""All Our Base Are Belong to Them"" could be live, it's hard to tell. Someone is strumming a guitar and then a
    voice starts counting down from ten, ""Space Oddity""-style. When he hits ""one,"" a noisy chord is played and
    four of five people cheer. Instead of annoying, though, the background chatter sounds wonderful against the
    guitar and picked banjo, as the vocals (the only real singing on the album) sing something close to Pink
    Floyd's ""Mother,"" sans-melodrama. It's warm and cozy wherever this is being recorded, even though something
    feels vaguely alien and unfamiliar.</p><p>
    
    A disturbing vocal exchange opens ""Motherless Bastard,"" as a man speaking to a small child says, ""You have
    no mother and father... they left, they went somewhere else."" The tune that follows this sampled intro is a
    pretty folk strum, the melodicism of Fahey without the flash or technique. Indeed, if I had to name one
    clear forbearer for The Books, John Fahey would be it. The odd combination of folk guitar forms and aural
    collage seem at least tangentially related to his experiments. But the pleasure to be had from <i>Thought
    for Food</i> has nothing to do with musical referencing. This modest and unusual album stands on its own as
    a quiet triumph-- one unlike anything I've ever heard before.</p></div>"|854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/854-thought-for-food/|9.0|Mark Richard-San

    around guitars with built-in amplifiers and ukuleles.  Nevertheless, they score remarkably high in the
    sentimental value category.  The first synthesizer budget-priced enough to serve as Christmas tree fodder
    for late-80s twelve and thirteen year-olds, the Casio has provided many of us with fond memories of
    one-finger jam sessions to a brisk rhumba preset, trying to decide whether the so-called 'violin' or
    'trumpet' setting was a more appropriate voicing.  My own model was the beautiful PT-87, complete with
    ROM disk port that allowed me to play along with hits of the day like ""Dancing in the Dark"" and ""Walk
    of Life.""</p><p>
    
    Still, like Casio's drinking buddy Atari, there's a certain amount of kitsch value attached to the instrument
    that prevents one from taking it too seriously.  Which is why the idea of a mostly-Casio album that purports
    to consist of melancholy compositions for lonely souls is a little cognitively dissonant, like a collection
    of funeral marches performed on Rapman and Drum Buddy.  So throughout Casiotone for the Painfully Alone's
    second LP, a listener's not quite sure whether to giggle, reminisce about soft-focus juvenile keyboard
    experiences, or mope along with CFTPA solitaire-junkie Owen Ashworth.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, when recorded right (read: poorly), Ashworth's digital friend is no less effective a tool for
    found-art, spontaneous-style tuning as the acoustic guitar most one-man acts choose.  The obvious
    com-parallel-ison here would be Mountain Goat John Darnielle, who has been known to include the occasional
    Casio throwdown on his own albums, and whose minimal, hiss-laden approach to production Ashworth apes here.
    Actually, he emulates more than just Darnielle's recording style: Ashworth also borrows the fragmentary
    song structure (the 3:43 ""Destroy the Evidence"" is a downright epic), occasional spoken-wordish delivery,
    and even has a geographically oriented breakup song titled ""Oh, Illinois!""</p><p>
    
    But where Darnielle's keyboard jams never quite match up with the monophonic vibrancy of his primary
    instrument, Ashworth shows a knack for augmenting his flimsy instrument with his meager means.  Copious
    amounts of fuzz grant the keyboard's rudimentary, built-in drumbeats significantly more texture (""Oh,
    Contessa!,"" ""Yr Boyfriend"") and the old over-distortion technique allows him to squeeze some impressively
    noisy waves out of the little guy (""Bus Song"").  Occasionally, when songs go on longer than fifty seconds,
    these elements allow for a surprisingly full sound that could almost pass for New Order streaming at 28.8
    kbps, with just about as much melodic appeal.  I'm thinking ""We Have Mice"" and ""Suitcase in Hand"" for
    you MP3-sampling types.</p><p>
    
    And yet, it remains tough to overlook the central gimmick of the album, and despite the rather valiant
    efforts of Ashworth, the Casio shows its limitations in setting a somber tone.  Little touches like the
    push-button tempo shift of ""The Subway Home"" or the hyper-minimalist song-frag ""Dying Batteries"" may be
    cute, but they counteract the album's thesis that the instrument is not mere junk-store novelty.  You

Located on the far west coast of Mexico,
    just across the border from San Diego, the city became popular as a den of iniquity during the Prohibition
    era.  Even today Californian teens ventures in droves over to the huge strip of bars and clubs on Revolucion
    Avenue, to take advantage of the 18-and-up drinking age.  Of course, in the last decade or so Tijuana has
    become known for its maquiladoras, touted as the successful model for modernization under NAFTA: factories
    in which electronic components and other materials are assembled by cheap labor and then shipped back to the
    States duty-free.  But the city has hardly shed the dangerous aura of <i>la frontera</i>-- a fact probably
    best symbolized in the 1994 murder of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio as he was stumping for
    votes there.</p><p>
    The Nortec Collective make every effort to show another, more artistic side of Tijuana, separate from
    debauchery and thug life.  Yet it's hard not to imagine even the drunken <i>touristas</i> and narco bosses
    getting down to the raucous Nortec style that's been created.  As legend has it, Pepe Mogt first began
    thinking about a connection between techno and traditional Mexican music while at a wedding listening to
    norteño, a form of folk music played on accordions, tubas, guitars and different types of drums. The
    polyrhythmic flair of the percussion and the accompanying brass lines make for a festive, parade-like
    air, and the sense of kitsch it invokes means the music is only popular in the north of Mexico.  It's
    mostly favored by adults-- the youth aren't as into the traditionalism.</p><p>
    But Mogt had other ideas.  Together with his friend Jorge Ruiz (soon to be his partner in techno act Fussible),
    they collected outtakes from norteño studio sessions and began to fuse the samples with electronica.  They
    got with a group of friends, all of whom were soon to have their own projects, and began to distribute tapes
    of the newly-made music at parties and clubs.  The story is old news, of course-- some of these tracks were
    recorded as far back as '99, and in the following two years spread like wildfire from Tijuana's student
    population to the homes of just about anybody who'd ever moved their feet to dance.  Thus, the Nor-tec
    phenomenon began, named alternately for the Norte of Mexico, or for the norteño music it came from.  The
    Collective eventually caught the interest of Island Records' Chris Blackwell, who released <i>The Tijuana
    Sessions, Vol. 1</i> on his Palm Pictures boutique label.</p><p>
    Absent the hype from features in <i>Time</i> magazine and elsewhere, it's easier to see that Nortec is
    popular first and foremost because it's damn good dance music.  Bostich kicks off the set with ""Polaris,""
    his international hit.  It's interesting that he's considered the godfather of the Nortec crowd, because
    his songs are the farthest removed from what is conventionally considered 'danceable' techno.  Digitally
    modified accordion static and tuba blurts bring a strong Latin vibe to the mix, soon augmented by crashing
    conga rhythms and keyboard hum.  The marching band atmosphere is preserved despite the electronic elements,
    making for a solid opener.</p><p>
    Fussible come next with ""Casino Soul,"" sliding in on a bank of synthesizers and following with sharp 70s
    horn riffs.  The catchy thrust of the bongo beats reminds me of the enthusiasm of Dubtribe Sound System's
    organic house.  Despite the emphasis on their Mexican heritage, the Collective rests, for the most part,
    firmly in the house music tradition; it's just that their use of live instruments and polyrhythmic breakdowns
    add fresh flavor to the club scene.  PaxF3ptica's ""and L"" (nice pun) descends into the submerged bass and
    synth-sonar of deep house, but the high-pitched percussive rumble on top casts it all into beautiful contrast.
    Likewise, Plankton Man gives us ""Elemento N,"" whose meandering intro suddenly coalesces into a driven
    progressive house number laced with solemn, noirish guitar work.</p><p>
    It's a smart compilation, careful to keep the listening side of the spectrum happy as well.  Clorofila slows
    the pace just a bit with ""Cantamar '72,"" as the sound of waves washes between the stereo channels.  The
    chillout atmosphere is deceiving, though, and before you know it the bass and drums drop into a sexy funk
    groove.  Terrestre takes it one step further on ""El Lado Oscuro de Mi Compadre,"" as an army of percussion
    samples rise up and clash together in a collage worthy of DJ Shadow.  It's a strangely tense, claustrophobic
    piece for the compilation, far from the melancholy musings that Fernando Corona's becoming more known for
    recently as Murcof.  All the better that he also offers up one of the classic dance cuts on the sampler,
    ""Norteño de Janeiro.""  I challenge you vocoder-phobes out there to convince me that the joyous, slightly
    wistful vocals here don't make for the most perfectly sublime chorus.</p><p>
<i>The Tijuana Sessions</i> grows on you until you realize that, beyond all the hype, these guys are making
    innovative dance music worth getting excited about.  There may be a few missteps, as with Hiperboreal's
    ""Tijuana for Dummies,"" whose condescending title doesn't do much to make up for the mid-90s tribal techno
    stylings it rehashes.  And on ""No Liazi Jaz,"" Plankton Man makes the mistake of coating his horn lines in
    ultra-synthesized, E-Z listening syrup.  But the suggestions of retro atmosphere throughout the disc,
    hidden here and there in the melodies, aren't much of a problem.  The Nortec artists are hinting at the
    relationship between past and future, one articulated now in the present between their music and the
    norteño and banda sinaloense it springs from.  They've become so popular on the dancefloor because they
    make music tailored to dancers, full of progressions and careful breaks that guide the body.</p><p>
    Though the producers have their own label in Mil Records, Nortec has become more than just a musical
    collective these days: fashion designers are forming futuristic Nortec rave clothes by updating traditional
    rural garb, urban artists are tagging the city in their own image through Nortec-derived stencils, and the
    government of Mexico has even sponsored a forum connecting the musicians with eager students of the aesthetic.
    Nortec is getting mixed into DJ sets abroad as well, particularly in Germany where the polka origins of
    norteño still resonate.  This is true cultural syncretism, the ideal genesis of new art out of the reverence
    of old, and especially important in its self-reliance.  The maquiladoras are now moving slowly but steadily
    to China to take advantage of the $.20 - $.25 per hour average working wage (versus Mexico's $1.50)-- so
    much for the permanent benefits of free trade!  In the meantime, check out the Nortec sound: it's more vital
    than whatever Eighteenth Street Lounge is pumping out, and you're not likely to come across as the annoying
    World Beat kid on your block.  If you're interested in the evolution of electronic dance music, this is not
    a style to let slip by.</p></div>"|1954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1954-nortec-collective-tijuana-sessions-vol-1/|8.0|Christopher Dare

    Subject: Borthwick/hollAnd, <i>Helene</i><br/>
    Reviewer: Haywood, B.R.</p><p>
    
    7/11/02. First attempt at listening to <i>Helene</i>. Album consists of
    only one track, a composition featuring a woman reading poetry written
    by ""renowned New York artist"" (label's words, not mine) Mark Borthwick,
    atop a simple arpeggiated acoustic guitar pattern.  The guitar occasionally
    cuts out, leaving dead silence. To quell the silence, famed electro-pop
    wizard Trevor hollAnd tosses diced-up pieces of the Borthwick poetry
    experience haphazardly back into the sonic landscape. That's all there
    is. Reviewer can't believe some of the shit that sees official release
    these days. Reviewer curses name of hollAnd. First attempt ends at 19:56.</p><p>
    
    7/14/02. Second attempt at listening to <i>Helene</i>. Album still only
    consists of one track. Reviewer incredulous, fast forwards through disc,
    looking for 'good parts.' Finding none after 26 minutes, second attempt
    ends prematurely at 26:15.</p><p>
    
    7/18/02. Third attempt at listening to <i>Helene</i>. Reviewer spends
    several hours on car ride to rural North Carolina, wondering if an
    album with only one track-- nay, only one musical <i>idea</i>-- can
    be considered an album. Reviewer supposes this is possible, but has
    his doubts. Reviewer plays <i>Helene</i> for 36 of last 45 minutes of
    road trip. Second attempt ends at 36 minutes when reviewer is pulled
    over by police. Reviewer curses name of Borthwick and Officer Hargrove.
    Still one track.</p><p>
    
    7/19/02. Fourth attempt at listening to <i>Helene</i>. Reviewer discovers
    that 10% of rural North Carolina towns are named Hargrove. Finds this less
    puzzling than the one-track, one-idea album, but puzzling nonetheless.
    Reviewer still angry at Borthwick, and wishes ill upon his renowned New
    York career. Despite anger, reviewer completes 39-minute listening
    experience, then punches self in head.</p><p>
    
    7/22/02. Fifth (residual) attempt at listening to <i>Helene</i>. Reviewer,
    in an attempt to rid self of lingering bias, listens to album once more.
    Reviewer reads another review to supplement own listening experience,
    learns that <i>Helene</i> was originally soundtrack to a gallery/performance
    piece (for Big Shot Borthwick, of all people).  <i>Helene</i> beginning to
    make more sense. Still crap.</p><p>
    
    Conclusion: Reviewer concludes, after three attempted and two completed
    listening experiences, that <i>Helene</i> is like a wedding video:
    if you were at the wedding, the video brings back fond memories; if
    you weren't, the video is perhaps only slightly more exciting than
    the wedding album. Similarly, <i>Helene</i> probably worked better
    when it accompanied Borthwick's artwork. Now it merely serves Borthwick,
    hollAnd, and their former patrons as a nice reminder of some fine month
    in Manhattan. All those not in attendance should steer clear.</p></div>"|872.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/872-helene/|4.0|Brad Haywood

They sort of just fell off the map completely. Weren't they at one
    time supposed to be the ""next big thing"" in indie rock? The next Pavement, I seem to recall.  Yep, back
    in the day, New Radiant Storm King had all the right connections: they called Amherst, Massachusetts home
    and hung with the Scud Mountain Boys, Guided by Voices, and the Silver Jews, among others.  They even had
    a breakthrough album with 1996's <i>Hurricane Necklace</i>.  Everyone I knew loved that record when it was
    first released, and it's a bit curious that nobody seems to remember it now.</p><p>
    
    Reason for this, I hypothesize, has something to do with the combination of slacker-rock being dead and
    gone (at least until its impending revival in 2011), and that the band was, frankly, completely and totally
    cursed when its came to record labels.  Suffice it to say they were just one of many talented bands to fall
    through the cracks when Rough Trade's American division folded-- and that was just the beginning of their
    problems.  They soldiered on, but during the past few years, the band simply disappeared, its members
    presumably pursing higher degrees.</p><p>
    
    Now, after much line-up shifting and label-hopping, New Radiant Storm King have pulled it together for
    <i>Winter's Kill</i>.  At the center of the band remains the songwriting duo of Peyton Pinkerton and Matt
    Hunter, sharing vocal duties (both with a slightly affected British accent) and swapping guitar, bass, and
    a whole basement full of keyboards.  Sadly, what they've turned out is far from groundbreaking.  What it
    is is a solid collection of short, complex, introspective pop songs, sounding a lot like GBV if Pollard went
    on a heavy singer/songwriter-record-and-used-book-buying binge.</p><p>
    
    Right from the first song, ""In the Spirit of Distance,"" it's obvious these guys still have too many brain
    cells left to be compared too closely with GBV, talking about ""a portrait of Dorian Gray"" and all, though
    the melody does seem to lift from those other notorious drunkards, the Replacements-- most notably their
    song ""Sixteen."" On ""Golden Parachute,"" the Radiant ones drop little nuggets of wisdom on you like, ""Keep
    your suitcase close to your heart,"" while the shimmering Rhodes-heavy ""Colony Falls"" imparts, ""You need to
    get lost to find out what you know."" Hey, it's a didactic album, and worthy lessons all, if delivered a bit
    on the stiff and stodgy side.</p><p>
    
    And that's really the only fault with this album: many of the songs are a bit too precious and sober. I
    respect restraint as long as it's kept in check. On <i>Winter's Kill</i>, though, I found myself wanting
    the odd little tempo changes or spaced-out interludes (such as the finale ""View of a Wedding through the
    Hubble Telescope"") to stray into weirder territory, and on the rare occasions where the band attempts to
    kick out the jams, it would've been nice had they been kicked with a wee bit more oomph. But maybe I'm just
    missing the higher subtleties.  I can see how this album is a consciously constructed 'grower.' It's not the
    work of a band trying to capture some quick attention with clumsy stabs at the latest trends, and in some
    ways, with its lack of laptop glitchery and primal screaming, it does come off somewhat conservative.  But
    maybe it's for this very reason that this album could prove to hold up better than the recent work of some
    other members of indie rock's illustrious Class of '92.</p></div>"|5774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5774-winters-kill/|7.0|Jason Nickey

    in an embarrassingly brief restaurant brawl, but he only met one abstraction he couldn't whup: everydayness.
    ""The malady of the quotidian,"" as he called it, reduced life to a nondescript paralysis, as one's routine
    eclipses the ""dumbly pent"" self and a universal conveyor belt outpaces one's own drive. This feeling can
    leave one hankering for the coming afternoon when technology is so extravagant and handy that self-hate and
    ennui can be cathartically dispatched by committing genocide on a roomful of one's clones.</p><p>
    
    Somehow, Swearing at Motorists' Dave Doughman finds inspiration in the quotidian; chronicling successions of
    unremarkable moments as if they were epiphanic is his stock in trade. Cramming fourteen songs into thirty
    minutes, this latest album's lyrics are impressionistic to the point of seeming like impulsive postcards or
    manic answering machine messages set to music. Anything can be a song: seeing an acquaintance in traffic,
    pressing buttons in an elevator, stumbling around drunk, stumbling around stoned, going to a show, watching
    TV up late-- even leaving the DC borough Adams Morgan warrants an evocative 40-second ditty. A previous
    album actually boasted an ode to a relationship stunted at an impasse over the work of Robin Williams.</p><p>
    
    I wanted to know what Doughman's secret was. How did he maintain such a high tolerance for the abyss, for
    the sound and fury that signify jack-diddly?  I stalked Swearing at Motorists for three shows to find out,
    only to be befuddled by why this band insists on being a rickety two-piece in concert. <i>This Flag Signals
    Goodbye</i> lays claim to full, multi-tracked walls of competing guitar tones, accompanied by Joseph
    Siwinksi's dramatic drumming, and keyboards, banjos, and trumpets, next to none of which is harnessed live.
    Doughman even leaps and slides apoplectically, as if he's hearing more than what's coming through the PA.
    The third time I saw him, he performed by himself, and I couldn't help but think during his cover of ""Please
    Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" that he was asking for an effing <i>band</i> to spontaneously manifest.
    He's fascinating to watch, at once:</p><p>
<li> the basement rocker who brings the basement with him<br/>
<li> the skinny guy just Manson enough to fight you<br/>
<li> the Angus Young spoof artist Angus Old<br/>
<li> the unambitious firstborn son who pathologically oversleeps<br/>
<li> the public access troubadour<br/>
<li> the clever Bizarro-Jesus lookalike who plays ""Galaga"" before the performance and asks for mushrooms
    during it<br/>
<li> and the show-taping dynamo who makes up songs on the spot about the weather, the bar's neon signs, and
    bleached-blonde audience members talking too loud on their cellphones (""Daytona Beach is over,"" Doughman
    came into the crowd and told her, then sang a song about how he doesn't disturb her job at Whataburger, so
    why does she hamper his?)<p>
    
    Doughman hails straight outta the gray, gridded neighborhoods of Pollardville (Dayton), and shares GBV's
    urge to redeem cotton-mouthed drudgery in imaginative pop drapes. Though his detractors claim to hear an
    indie-rock Mellencamp, his songs blend elements of an avalanche of impressive touchstones-- most pronouncedly
    the Meat Puppets, Nirvana, and Jonathan Richman, though ""Fan Mail for a Criminal"" raucously dips the early
    Pixies in early Pavement, and ""The Real Thing"" could be smuggled onto a 764-Hero LP without detection. Many
    of the tracks are love songs written too late to save anything, as the speaker's general ""I"" mourns the
    seismographic arc spent with a (sometimes off-puttingly) specific ""you."" Reassuringly, some folks can still
    appreciate affection as being more than misfiltered attention, and can muster belief that love isn't just an
    absurd ritual concocted to guarantee an audience for one's orgasms.</p><p>
    
    Nostalgia is the only thing that stumps Doughman. ""I can't seem to think past the past,"" he sings, crippled
    when his ""mind's in reverse."" This sentiment should comfort anyone with a tendency to crawl up yesterday's
    ass for naptime. After playing an old song at his solo show, he said, without pretense or false modesty:
    ""Huh. I used to be clever sometimes.""</p><p>
    
    Unless recycled chord progressions or muted string-scraping gets you down, <i>This Flag Signals Goodbye</i>
    holds up replay after replay, its only fault being that some of the riskily earnest lyrics, if slightly
    recontextualized (say, if Tenacious D sung them) would be hilarious (Kraft example: ""All I want for Christmas
    is you,"" etc). This singalong knows that it's slight, even as it skirts the heinous detritus of post-love
    love and summons the cloud whose job it is to always rain on that one small section of the interstate.
    Postpone your yammering pursuit of misery with this album that acknowledges its limits when Doughman honors
    an epidemic of premature conclusions with the refrain ""I can't seem to makes these things last.""</p></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></p></div>"|7650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7650-this-flag-signals-goodbye/|7.4|William Bowers

Some of his devotees whip themselves until their skin is a bloody
    mockery of normality. Some spend decades in the deserts with nothing but the burning sun and the freezing
    cold for companionship, and the occasional locust for nutrition. Others allow poisonous snakes to inject
    them with venom so that Jesus' healing power might neutralize the effects of the serpent's fatal alkalines.
    A prolific electronic prankster and man of many guises (Atom Heart, Señor Coconut, Lassigue Bendthaus, to
    mention just a few of his masks), Uwe Schmidt praises Jesus by imprisoning the voices of gospel singers in
    his hard drive.</p><p>
<i>Nobody Knows</i> is Schmidt's second stab at creating the definitive motherboard devotional microhouse
    glitch album.  But having listened to the result many times, I'm forced into concluding that his first
    attempt, <i>My Life with Jesus</i>, came closer to meeting his goal. The primary reason <i>Nobody Knows</i>
    packs a smaller wallop than its predecessor is simply the lack of a killer track. <i>My Life with Jesus</i>
    floored me with ""Soul of Mine""-- a bucking house groove rhythmically offset with shards of glitch atop of
    which an uncredited female voice sang of her soul's certain journey back to God. In intensity and sincerity,
    ""Soul of Mine"" is rivaled only by Ralph Stanley's ""O, Death"" and Virginia Rodrigues' inspired performance of
    the spiritual ""I Want to Be Ready.""</p><p>
    Throughout <i>Nobody Knows</i>, Uwe Schmidt plays more for the microhouse community than to anyone more
    interested in the recontexulizing of gospel.  And when Schmidt does throw something out for the latter group,
    he chooses easy targets. Case in point: the stupidly obvious retooling of ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.""  Fans
    who come for the microhouse, however, suffer no such indignities or disappointments. ""It's No Secret (What
    God Can Do)"" is Schmidt's most rarefied abstraction of unearthly sounds; their brooding propulsion forces
    the listener to recall the opening verses of the first chapter of Genesis. ""The Love of God"" begins in a
    similarly portentous fashion-- as an inexorable climatic movement towards thunderousness before Schmidt
    drops in the sample, an enraptured gent soulfully crooning about ""The Love of God.""  Here, Schmidt uses the
    sample and its juxtaposition to say something about the fervor of religious conviction and his respect for
    it. But elsewhere, Schmidt throws his respect aside. ""Pray"" uses a sample of a woman singing only the song's
    namesake as just another rhythmic element in his complexly funky arrangements. Likewise, strip out the male
    voice repeating the word 'Jesus' during ""Sing You Children"" and you have boilerplate Mille Plateaux glitch.</p><p>
    Yet even when Schmidt panders to the godless IDM listserve subscribers, he proves that he can turn out a
    spastic drill-n-glitch ravey roof-raiser such as ""I'm Determined (Jesus Changed My Soul).""  In these moments,
    no one could seriously doubt Schmidt's prodigious skills as a programmer and musician, even if he is capable
    of much more satisfying and unique material.</p><p>
    The central mystery of <i>Nobody Knows</i> is that nobody knows how ironic Schmidt is being with these tracks.
    I have no doubt that he was sincere and reverential on <i>My Life with Jesus</i>-- he took uncommon care to
    preserve the honesty and the message of those whose devotions he sampled and contorted into his sparse house
    grooves.  But I can't say the same for <i>Nobody Knows</i>.  The gold-embossed, pixilated depiction of Jesus
    and the copperplate font of the cover art are a major indication of Schmidt's cheekiness. It's technology and
    the programming intricacy that fascinates him here. Under other circumstances, I'd be at least as fascinated
    by his talent. But by mixing in these very emotional performances, in which the singers reveal their innermost
    and cherished hopes for a better life after death, I feel Schmidt has robbed them of some of their dignity
    and belittles their faith. Without any reason to criticize Schmidt's exemplary production and composition,
    your acceptance of <i>Nobody Knows</i> will pivot on how strongly you respect the religious convictions of
    others, or appreciate Schmidt's cavalier attitude towards them.</p></div>"|3414.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3414-nobody-knows/|7.8|Paul Cooper

    with little success.  Selling off unopened vials of Andy Warhol's crystal meth on eBay (to collectors)
    got me a small fortune, but markets still remained stagnant, and apparently my idea for what I called an
    'automobile' had been developed more than a century earlier.  No matter how hard I tried to stimulate the
    economy, she rejected all of my Initial Public Offerings.  I was near the end of my rope when, while sipping
    martinis off the stomachs of prostitutes with my good friend Ken Lay, he gave me a tip on a little known
    subsidiary of the Laura Lee corporation.  This Division of Laura Lee was primarily concerned with producing
    the very sort of politically charged rock that should have been just the thing to jumpstart the markets and
    restore investor confidence.  I was sold.  After a series of hasty eleventh hour negotiations, the Division
    of Laura Lee was divested from its parent company, The Cayman Islands Offshore Holding Corporation, and I
    was about to learn, too late, that the Division would have a hard enough time vitalizing my stereo speakers,
    let alone a bear market.</p><p>
    
    The Sweden-based Division was allegedly taking cues from the Stooges and the Jesus and Mary Chain, among
    other successful ventures, so I immediately called my old frat buddy Alan Greenspan to come over and give
    them a listen.  We played badminton and swilled some homemade rye whiskey, and I cranked out the sounds of
    <i>Black City</i>, the Division's latest product.  The swaggering bass and crash of guitars at the heart of
    opener ""Got to Get Some"" didn't call to mind of any of their self-reported influences, but it was solid and
    infectious, even if the siren-like background electronics were a little over-the-top.  Greenspan flippantly
    dismissed the boys as ""The (International) Noise Conspiracy, with synths,"" but he doesn't hold the cards in
    this particular review (though his thorough examinations of Cerberus Shoal and Earth Crisis are nothing to
    scoff at).</p><p>
    
    Undeterred, I stuck to my guns and was immediately pleased as ""We've Been Planning This for Years"" took the
    slow burn of the lead track and intensified it.  ""Planning"" exploded like a powderkeg out of the opener's
    ashes; Per Stalberg's cries of ""money will break your fall"" coupled the political savvy I'd been looking for
    with a musclebound onslaught of riffs and fills.  ""Number One"" continued the landslide of guitar-fueled
    aggression.  Most of the band's time was spent railing against the evils of capitalistic profit ideals,
    but none of that was of any import with a delivery this sweeping, passionate and invigorating.  Beneath
    the slick, barbed hooks I could almost hear the markets strengthening.  Alan was reserving judgment, though;
    he muttered something about whether or not the band could maintain this level of activity.  Sure, it might
    have been a fluke, but the first three tracks showed consistent growth and I was willing to bank on them.</p><p>
    
    Alan was right, though, as fucking usual.  Prescient bastard.  The energy of the opening proved to be just
    a first-quarter surge.  The moment I took <i>Black City</i> public, the bubble of enthusiasm surrounding the
    early tracks burst, and the rest of the album lost its footing.  ""Trapped In"" and ""I Guess I'm Healed""
    started to take the Division in entirely the wrong direction.  These lazy, weak-kneed stabs at vaguely
    sinister slow numbers were D.O.A.; the Division just didn't seem to be able to infuse them with enough soul.
    For the same reasons, ""I Walk on Broken Glass"" tanked like Iraqi Special Forces.  In context, it was more
    like the Division just needed a break, rather than actually wanting to produce the sort of sincere, intimate
    ballads they were trying their hand at.  Rumors spread on Wall Street that my Division of Laura Lee had been
    artificially inflating their rock acumen and investors fled.  I was out like Worldcom.</p><p>
    
    In their defense, the Swedes made a few more passable attempts to recapture the spirit of <i>Black City</i>'s
    early moments to show that they wouldn't drop without a fuss.  There were a handful more barnburners left--
    notably ""Pretty Electric"" and ""Access Identity""-- but with the spotty pacing of the remainder of their
    portfolio, it just never felt as natural as their initial strutting posture.  Eventually, the Division of
    Laura Lee's <i>Black City</i> turned in a modestly successful effort, interspersed with a few hits and misses,
    although even at its best it wasn't anything that hadn't been done before.  My options had taken a nose-dive,
    and I finally knew what it meant to have the financial rug pulled out from under me.  The moral of the story
    was obvious: listen to Alan Greenspan, and when a band promises non-stop rocking, make sure their heart is
    in it before you bet the farm.</p></div>"|2343.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2343-black-city/|6.7|Eric Carr

Having begun her musical career with DC's
    Autoclave with Christine Billotte of Slant 6 (and more recently Quix*o*tic), she soon assumed Mary Lou
    Lord's position in Boston-based Helium, releasing three fantastic pop records and a handful of singles.
    Since that band's 1998 demise, Timony has sustained herself with side projects and a solo career
    culminating now with <i>The Golden Dove</i>, her second release.  Through all of this, she has remained
    an inventive, if erratic, songwriter and guitarist, and has largely done so by drawing inspiration from
    the most unlikely of places.</p><p>
    
    Mining the fantasy genre for musical and artistic enlightenment isn't without its risks. It's no accident
    that most artists who've successfully captured legions of fans via Tolkein-esque mass delusions aren't likely
    to show up on my personal hit parade. And that may be because I lost my taste for bombastic classic rock with
    proggy pretentions after the 75th replay of <i>Led Zeppelin IV</i> at summer camp circa 1989, but I think
    it runs deeper than all that.  Tori Amos, for example, never sounded quite herself after admitting to
    late-night debates with 'the fairies.'  Call me a skeptic, but I'll take a song about breakfast over one
    about elves any minute of the year.</p><p>
    
    Which naturally begs the question of how it is that I've been able to maintain an affinity for Mary Timony's
    output since the early 90s, despite evidence suggesting that she's a prime contender for Miss Congeniality
    in the Mythologized Middle Ages Pageant. She's certainly crossed the line into self-indulgent Dungeons and
    Dragons eccentricity, with her songs' medieval tavern jam sequences and lyrical allusions that walk about
    two steps shy of Renaissance Faire farce (one part Tolkein, one part bodice ripper).  You get the impression
    she's maybe even entertained thoughts of live shows including such dubious entertainments as multiple costume
    changes, laser light dragons, dancing knights, skits in Old English, and maybe a lute player or two.  But
    Timony is talented and not easily categorizable by sound.  The risk of writing music this complex, theatrical
    and outright weird is that it often leads to self-indulgence, but when it works, the output justifies the
    expense.</p><p>
<i>The Golden Dove</i>, Mary Timony's second solo release, again dons the Arthurian garb.  Lyrically, she
    imbues a contemporary landscape with bizarre manifestations of magical realism, quotes liberally from what
    I can only assume is a dog-eared anthology from a long past Renaissance Lit class, and sets a 17th century
    poem to music. Likewise, she makes bold instrumentation choices in songs maybe best left to guitar, bass,
    and drums, and continues to show the same prog-inspired affinities poorly exemplified by her first solo
    release.</p><p>
    
    That being said, <i>The Golden Dove</i> has moments of significant achievement. It shows greater similarity
    to Timony's earlier work than its predecessor, and to put it simply, it rocks a little harder. ""Blood Tree""
    builds into an uncharacteristically pop chorus, over which Timony croons, ""I don't care about you, and
    whatever you want me to do,"" before resolving with, ""The only boy I ever loved/ Turned into a golden dove/
    And moved to California.""</p><p>
    
    Timony's latest incarnation sees her more inclined to catchy songwriting.  The eerie, angular, piano-based
    ""Dr Cat"" is transformed halfway through with the introduction of a driving dance beat, making it seem the
    impossibly odd bastard child of new wave and demented nursery rhyme.  Many of the best moments, though, are
    more typical of Timony's work with Helium.  The intricate Polvo-influenced guitar (cribbed from one-time
    Helium member Ash Bowie) and unsettling jangle of the chorus are strong enough to distract you from moments
    of lyrical reference to talking with animals and the fact that you'll swear you've heard some of the songs
    before. (""Look a Ghost in the Eye,"" in particular, is a dead ringer for Helium's ""Devil's Tears"").  But the
    first half of the album, dominated by this sort of material, is much more memorable and cohesive than the
    balladeering second half. These later tracks struggle, despite their comparative briefness and Timony's
    inviting vocal work.</p><p>
    
    A small success may be preferable to a small failure, though, and on a larger scale, <i>The Golden Dove</i>
    is a better than average album.  It's just that Timony has long outshined 'better than average,' and I'd
    so infinitely prefer bearing witness to what she might be capable of achieving with 'totally fucking
    awesome.'</p></div>"|8066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8066-the-golden-dove/|7.1|Alison Fields

    volumes about their career. Need illustration in the form of snarky and hyper-referential 'single serving'
    synopses? I think we'll get along...</p><p>
<li>Smashing pumpkins may seem a fun and exciting enterprise to adolescent suburbia, but loses its appeal
    with age.<p>
<li>The U2, although once the silent ruler of the sky, seems a distant memory in our collective cultural
    consciousness since becoming a symbol of political turmoil and skewered international relations rather than
    an exacting weapon of intelligence.<p>
    ""Little wings,"" however, appear to be an obvious evolutionary misstep-- appendages that serve no purpose to
    their host, other than as visible reminders of how futile and zealous nature can be in its rampant
    experimentalism.  Likewise, if I was K records, I'd be in the bathroom with a saw and some ointment right
    now.</p><p>
    Taking musical cues from the Oldham family side project, The Anomoanon, Little Wings' sparse-mountain-folk-by-way-of-warbly-vocals
    consciously vies with Will and the gang for marketing dominance over the indie community's wildly profitable
    bourbon-swilling infant demographic. While it's to lead-singer/songwriter Kyle Field's credit that the child-like
    observations and paradoxically pensive optimism found throughout <i>Light Green Leaves</i> never lapse into
    a parody of the genre, the fact remains that there's nothing to distinguish Little Wings from their sonic
    forebears. That, juxtaposed with song titles that occasionally come off as cutting-room-floor dialogue for
    the Björk vehicle <i>Dancer in the Dark</i>, (""Boom!"", ""iii"", ""Si Si"", etc.), makes it pretty apparent that
    what we have here is just another mediocre addition to the litany of alt-country revivalists.</p><p>
    That isn't to say that Fields is content with simply churning out product. While it's true that <i>Light
    Green Leaves</i> acts as nothing more than a reiteration of Little Wings' heralded ""Wonder Trilogy,"" the
    spare and evocative delivery of such tracks as ""Uh-Oh (It's Morningtime Again)"" and ""Under Your Blanket""
    finds the group coming extraordinarily close to transcending their limited musical vocabulary. Unfortunately,
    the record gives more indications of stagnation than of progress, asking the listener to marvel at how many
    disingenuous folk songs one man can author in the shortest given period of time, rather than invoking the
    wide-eyed wonder the lyrics would suggest.</p><p>
    Upon its release, <i>Light Green Leaves</i> will be available in three different formats, each chronicling
    the album in a different stage of completion. A fairly presumptuous move on the group's part, considering
    their relatively small fanbase.  Maybe Kyle Field's exhausting his musical catalog so as to prepare himself
    for a complete 'revisioning.' His close friendship with the Microphones' Phil Elvrum couldn't hurt, though I
    doubt Elvrum has had much time to exert his influence, what with being nominated for saint-hood by Pitchfork's
    recently established Our Lady of the Lo-Fi and producing Mirah's excellent <i>Advisory Committee</i>. But,
    knowing the luck of the buying public, Field is just readying himself for a breakthrough collaboration with
    Shel Silverstein.</p></li></p></li></p></div>"|4817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4817-light-green-leaves/|4.9|Kevin Adickes

I mean, it's late July
    already.  Summer is half over!  Don't tell me you've resigned yourself to the old standby again.  You know
    as well as I do that the <i>Master of Puppets</i> tape that fused itself to the inside of your boombox when
    you left it out in the sun while painting your parents' garage in '94 no longer captures your sweaty summertime
    bummer.  Your frustrations are too complex now to climax with ""Damage, Inc.""</p><p>
    
    Lucky for me, I happened across the perfect musical accompaniment to my lazy, hazy, wallowing-in-doubt-and-anxiety,
    dirty south, palmetto-bug-battlin' summer mope-fest: <i>And the Surrounding Mountains</i> by the Radar
    Brothers. Its vaguely depressive lyrics and wide-angle spaciousness suits my ambivalence to these hotter
    months perfectly, with just the right amount of intro/extro-spection to keep me going until Autumn comes to
    cool the blood.</p><p>
    
    I've listened to this album for almost two weeks straight now, enough to know that it's not going to wear
    off before the heat does. And that's despite the utterly stupefying simplicity of its component parts. Most
    of these songs shuffle along at the same slow, swaggering tempo with little sonic variation: they're usually
    built around acoustic guitar and warm analog synths, with vocalist Jim Putnam's David Gilmour-meets-Kermit
    tenor floating above in a languid drawl of humid acquiescence.  Yet the album never loses itself in its own
    mired apathy; it instead maps a comfortable niche where mercury rises to meet a setting sun and dread, drugs
    and death are the only necessary comforts.  Indeed, the Radar Brothers are smart to stick with what works,
    and as the album proceeds, each song seems to cozily sink into the next like sweat into faded t-shirts.</p><p>
    
    Radar Brothers are usually lumped in with slowcore groups of the Low variety, and there's a reason for that.
    But it's a better point of reference for their earlier albums, as they've expanded their sound here to
    position themselves along the lysergic axis of Mercury Rev and the Flaming Lips.  Admittedly, they're far
    less overtly <i>weird</i> than Wayne Coyne-- no psychedelic parables starring giant robots as grim death--
    and rather than orchestral bombast and angelic ghost-choirs, they summon a distinctly mellow California
    vibe incorporating only the mundane guitar, piano and occasional synth.</p><p>
<i>And the Surrounding Mountains</i> begins with the grand and spacious sound of soaring harmonies and
    crashing cymbals, like the dawn breaking on a vast mountain range, while Putnam intones a vaguely
    threatening line to clue us in that all is not well under the bright blue, cloudless sky.  The album peaks
    with ""Rock of the Lake,"" the band perfecting their hallmarks: the spacy keys, the slow, swaying rhythm, and
    lyrics both strangely comforting and sinister.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, the Bros. get Floydian with ""Uncles,"" which recalls
    <i>More</i>-era fluidity, and ""Mountains,"" which could pass for a condensed version of one of Roger Waters'
    epic side-spanners.  Familial themes run through the record-- first there's ""You and the Father,"" followed
    by ""Sisters,"" ""Uncles,"" and ""Mothers"" (and lest we forget, the band's name is Radar Brothers)-- but otherwise,
    there's no clear thread uniting these songs into a singular concept.  It's better that way, though, so that
    these tracks can work in all kinds of situations: indoor, outdoor, alone, with friends, morning, night-- an
    essential component of any summer soundtrack.</p><p>
    
    So climb outta that hammock and put down that glass of Country Time.  Get in your car.  You needed to pick
    up some more fertilizer today anyway.  Stop off at your local record shop, and pick up a copy of <i>And the
    Surrounding Mountains</i>.  I promise, it'll be worth your while.  And if I'm wrong, ""Leper Messiah"" will
    still be waiting for you back at the house.</p></div>"|6644.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6644-and-the-surrounding-mountains/|8.1|Jason Nickey

    saving up to buy that new Ford Thunderbird, and wondering whether he could score with younger chicks if he
    ditched the wife.  In people years, the ten-year-old subterranean Windy City post-everything scene has
    entered its middle ages and is starting to show all the inherent backwards-looking neuroses of the phase.
    Jim O'Rourke's hard-rocking kiss-off to the increasingly cliché jazz-rock sound on <i>Insignificance</i>
    was the initial salvo, but recently, bands like Rian Murphy's Chestnut Station and Giant Sand have also
    embraced the classic-rock sound.  One practically expects the next Tortoise to be a collection of Styx
    covers.</p><p>
    Into this breach flies Archer Prewitt, veteran of the defunct Coctails and the MIA Sea and Cake, and
    possessor of the second best name in indie rock after Mr. Tobin Sprout.  As both band cog and solo artist,
    Prewitt has done about as much as anybody to boost vibraphone sales and sculpt the dreamy, humid summer/snowy
    winter ambience of Chi-town's trademark sound.  But now, as <i>Three</i>'s psychedelic cover art and
    numerical heading seem to indicate, Prewitt's got his FM dial locked in on the sometimes-beloved,
    sometimes-maligned period between the Beatles and the Bee Gees.</p><p>
<i>Three</i> doesn't mess with the Prewitt formula too much-- meaning he'll still maintain his place amongst
    the other artists in Amazon's ""Customers who bought Elliott Smith's <i>XO</i> also bought..."" recommendations
    list-- but the differences aren't hard to spot.  More strident guitar and drumming, lots of tambourine and
    organ, a complete lack of shame when it comes to sudden string/horn overdub free-for-all.  Of course,
    Prewitt's gentle voice keeps things from rocking with a capital R, but remember that the mid-70s were the
    golden age of the bell-bottom jeans singer/songwriter as well.  Picture Cat Stevens, Jackson Browne, and
    Lindsay Buckingham swapping hair-care secrets in an organic L.A. bistro circa 1974 and you're getting there.</p><p>
    It's a strategy shift that allows for a damn fine first-half of an album.  Opener ""Over the Line"" (sadly,
    not preceded in the chorus by the words ""one toke"" and followed by ""sweet Jesus"") tricks the listener with
    a traditionally Thrill Jockey-esque slow riff before building momentum to a downright soulful climax peppered
    with Neil Young-style harmonica squawks.  ""Tear Me All Away"" punctuates the new approach in a compact
    less-than-two-minutes of hyperactive strumming and harpsichord arpeggios more classical than classic.
    ""Gifts of Love"" initially comes at you with the two-chord progression and melodic bass found in 90% of the
    Sea and Cake fakebook, but layers on enough orchestra and flute frosting to hide the resemblance.</p><p>
    As with most of the 70s sensitive guy genre though, a lot of the music here toes the schmaltz line.  And by
    the second half of <i>Three</i>, Prewitt's tripped right over it, landing in dangerous Neil Diamond territory.
    The LP closes with a quintet of excessively long number, half of which take a needlessly abrupt dogleg two
    minutes in; half of which droop under ponderous lyrics like, ""Forever cold/ And lost in space,"" repeated ad
    nauseam.  Elements like the Lambchop-brand heavenly choir female backup singers go from tasteful lime
    flavoring (""I'm Coming Over"") to over-sweetened lemonade (cooing ""oh babe, hold me"" on ""No Defense"").
    ""Behind the Sun"" finds Archer veering a little too close to the artist formerly known as Cat for my tastes,
    while ""Sister Ice"" is a vivid reminder of why punk was a necessary response to the excesses of 70s rock.</p><p>
    So <i>Three</i> ends up as a great EP set amongst a lot of so-so filler, damning it to the nefarious 7.x
    regions of the Pitchfork scale.  It's an agreeable summer listen, but forgive me if yet another defection
    of a Chicago underground notable towards the classic-rock bin is also a wee bit troubling.  Sure, the hazy
    Prekop/McEntire thing was moving more and more towards EZ-Listening territory, but is this what all that
    musical exploration comes to: tunes not far off from what Matthew Sweet was doing early last decade?  Are
    we at the end of the line for this phase of the City by the Lake's musical progression, or are <i>Three</i>
    and its siblings a mere temporary re-assessment of roots and influences?  Prepare a 3000-word essay for next
    week.</p></div>"|6468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6468-three/|7.3|Rob Mitchum

    utterly ridiculous.  When I first heard their 12-inch ""I Shot Reagan"" in 1998, I thought they were the heirs
    to Public Enemy's agitprop hip-hop throne.  2000's ""Black Helicopters,"" with its dark, claustrophobic
    production and Ill Bill's proclamation that ""American taught me how to kidnap and torture cats"" further
    whetted my appetite for the first incarnation of <i>The Future Is Now</i>, which was scheduled to be
    released later that year on Matador. So when the word on the street, or at least speculation via Non Phixion
    fans, said that Matador dropped them due to the extremism of their politics, I shook my head and cursed those
    bullfighting cowards.  It seemed as though Non Phixion would join the long line of hip-hop artists whose
    albums were buried before ever seeing the light of day.</p><p>
    
    Now, as I'm listening to the 2002 version of <i>The Future Is Now</i>, I'm beginning to wish that it had
    never been released, and I'm starting to think that the heads at Matador were just more discerning than
    fraidycat.  Instead of the scathing socio-political critique I'd expected, Non Phixion has released an album
    that is perhaps the first example of inadvertent post-apocalyptic Marxist kitsch.  It sounds as though
    somewhere along the way Non Phixion mastermind Ill Bill pawned his Chomsky books for baggies of cocaine and
    began drifting thematically closer to the crackhead comic relief of Flavor Flav than to the anti-capitalist
    stance of Chuck D.</p><p>
    
    Even the titles are contradictory, corny, and unimaginative: <i>The Future Is Now</i>, ""Futurama"" (where
    ""cyborgs will kill your mamma!""), ""There Is No Future,"" and ""We Are the Future.""  And the lyrics are even
    more so: ""Jews, Muslims, Christians/ What the fuck's the difference?/ We all want money, drugs and bitches/
    Anybody that doesn't rubs me suspicious.""  I'm trying not to say that political dissent has to be
    intellectually polished, and I'm certainly not trying to be some moral watchdog, but when lines like this
    are spewed by some snarling, white emcee mugging for the camera with a shotgun, I have to question not only
    his intelligence, but also his initial motivation for adopting a political stance.  Perhaps in their quest
    to be the perpetually fashionable, anti-everything group of the month, Non Phixion merely adopted some of
    the more sensationalistic rhetoric of political radicalism.</p><p>
    
    It really is a shame that Non Phixion comes across as being so juvenile.  Technically, Ill Bill and Sabec
    Red are decent emcees; they stay on the beat and their flows are effective.  The album is loaded with great
    production work by the likes of Pete Rock, Large Professor, and Necro.  DJ Premier's ""Rock Star"" even boasts
    the best Primo track since the last Gang Starr album.  But you can't escape the weak subject matter, the
    pointless misogyny, and the sheer stupidity of the lyrics.  Perhaps hip-hop's recent turn towards complexity
    has me a bit spoiled, but I can't imagine that it would've made a difference when this album was released;
    <i>The Future Is Now</i> is a regressive and reactionary statement, regardless of the year.</p></div>"|5831.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5831-the-future-is-now/|4.6|Sam Chennault

    at the peak of a coke frenzy.  That's understandable given the diverse range of artists they've helped out
    over the years (many of whom have repaid the favor with exclusive works for this three-disc box), though
    it doesn't help that these tracks seem to have been arranged via dartboard.  Example: I was pretty wowed by
    the Matmos/J. Lesser/Hrvatski collaboration that kicks off the second disc.  The scorching rendition of
    ""Powder"" recorded at Chicago's Empty Bottle (by Shellac's Bob Weston, no less) is a powerful reminder of
    just what a mighty force Bedhead was back in the day.  And the Meat Beat Manifesto track that follows stays
    true to Jack Dangers' well-established formula, not anything truly unexpected but still a pretty wonderful
    assault of the senses.  Yet despite the quality of these picks, I can't help but question the sequencing of
    such sonically divergent tracks.  Who sandwiches conventional indie rock between noise-inflected glitchcore
    and throbbing industrial heart attacks?  It makes for an awkward flow-- more so than with your average
    compilation, which, unlike <i>Brain in the Wire</i>, typically revolves around some general theme.</p><p>
    
    But I hear you.  You could give a crap about this continuity bullshit; what you really came to read about
    is the music.  Fine, then.  But find a comfortable chair 'cause we're gonna be here a while.  <i>Brain in
    the Wire</i> (the title of which refers to its initial pressing, which came free with a subscription to the
    British avant-garde music magazine <i>The Wire</i>) is three solid hours of screeching noise, programmed clicks, ambient phasing, and molten
    space-rock that reads like a who's who of contemporary underground music.  And the overwhelming majority
    of these tracks are top-shelf material, something that can't be said of most 'previously unreleased'
    offerings.  Jungle specialist Panacea turns in a brain-rattling dub reconstruction of a contemporary
    mainstream rap track about manning battle stations; !!! work their punk/funk hybrid with a tight live
    rendition of ""Hammerhead"" and, on ""disc x"" (for which the tracklist is a surprise-- and a pleasant one,
    at that), win best song title with ""We Were Stoned When We Thought Up the Title of This and We Didn't
    Want to Give It a Name That We Had to Explain as 'Oh Yeah We Were Stoned When We Thought of It' So We're
    Just Calling It Improvisational Jam 11-02-01.""</p><p>
    
    There are a few clunkers, sure. The discs are spotted with inexplicable forays into folky, singer/songwriter
    pieces that drag on documenting little private dramas nobody wants to hear about.  And then there's the sad
    tale of Current 93, who continues his recent trend of ignoring his own inestimable talent in favor of
    longwinded whining and acoustic guitar.  But the great on this compilation outweighs the merely forgettable,
    and even when the results are predictable they still tend to be plenty enjoyable.  Fridge contributes some
    of their chopped-up, guitar-based post-rock, Windy &amp; Carl turn out another beautiful drone piece, Tino does
    breakbeat-heavy dub, the Legendary Pink Dots make tribal kraut-style rock with strings and oboes, and Kid
    606 offers the typically irreverent ""Pregnant Cheerleader Theme Song,"" which sets giggling, helium-voiced
    chants of, ""I'm sexy/ I'm cute/ I'm popular to boot,"" ""I'm wanted/ I'm hot/ I'm everything you're not,"" and,
    ""I'm pretty/ I'm cool/ I dominate this school,"" to one of his standard-issue pounding basslines.</p><p>
    
    All of these tracks are mighty entertaining, but the best moments come from those artists who-- assuming this
    box will wind up mostly in the hands of purists and longtime fans-- took <i>Brain in the Wire</i> as an
    opportunity to try out something totally different.  Coil, for example, shuns the gloom and foreboding he
    built his good name on in favor of what is, for all intents and purposes, a very well constructed piece of
    raver-style dance music, complete with thumping bass, cheesy drum machines, fluttering synths and panting
    vocals.  On the other side of the spectrum, Keith Fullerton Whitman (aka Hrvatski) turns his back on his
    typical rapid-paced drum-n-glitch and instead hands in a superb work for prepared piano, just slightly
    tweaked with digital post-production.  Initially, the casual listener might have a difficult time
    distinguishing between the processed sounds of this track and the organic ones, but as the 10+ minute-long
    piece progresses, the acoustic sounds are overtaken by showers of echoes and chunks of inverted waveforms
    wisping by at lightning speeds.  Also winning big subtlety points are the Kadane brothers, who contribute
    ""Harvest,"" an instrumental that begins as a meditative guitar duet before settling on two ingeminating guitar
    patterns, adding drums and lightly struck bells to the mix.  Elsewhere, Broadcast produces a solid microhouse
    track with effects-layered vocals and an eventual barrage of strange noises that owes more to the current
    tech-pop scene than to their recent LPs.</p><p>
<i>Brain in the Wire</i> is a costly little nugget, but it's packed with endearing work from enduring
    artists, and with its limited pressings and distribution, it's not going to be around much longer.  Its
    three discs are as varied as can be, and sometimes to a fault, but frankly, if the worst thing a guy like
    me can say about a box like this is that it's too diverse, I'm probably just searching for imperfections to
    provide the illusion that this is really a piece of legitimate criticism and not just the inane rantings of
    another record-collecting addict.  Shit, I'll just put it this way: for a slapping down of one Grant-faced
    dollar bill, you walk away with a stainless steel container housing a healthy mix of rock, industrial, dub,
    electronic and ambient sounds that are just as welcome an addition to any music collection as Brainwashed.com
    is to the underground music community.  And if that's not ringing-endorsement enough for you, you've been
    staring at too many web banners.</p></div>"|1857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1857-brain-in-the-wire/|7.9|David M. Pecoraro

    odds 'n' sods throw-together job, a clearing house for the half-baked ideas Mice Parade main-man Adam Pierce
    has lying around his Bubble Core office. Every indie band that endures for any length of time is obligated
    to release one of these babies; more often than not, the serious fan already has all the decent tracks and
    the collection is a waste of money.  <i>All Roads Lead to Salzburg</i>, however, is an exception to this
    dodgy tradition.</p><p>
    
    Instead of a broom pile, <i>All Roads Lead to Salzburg</i> offers a more complete picture of what Mice Parade
    is all about. While last year's fine <i>Mokoondi</i> showed Adam Pierce to be a master at the one-man-band
    aesthetic, here we get several opportunities to hear the project as a live unit, and they do not disappoint.
    The band on the BBC sessions includes Dylan Cristy on vibes, Pierce on cheng (the Chinese zither used so
    effectively on <i>Mokoondi</i>), Marc Wolf on nylon string guitar, Rob King on keyboards, Doro Tachler on
    violin, and most importantly, the godlike Doug Scharin on drums and percussion.</p><p>
    
    It's an unusual mix of instruments, with the violin and cheng lending a Far-East flavor that blends nicely
    with Western chord voicings and a classical minimalist sense of repetition and structure. The interplay
    between the musicians is fluid and intuitive. The recording of ""Circle One"" expands greatly on the studio
    version with a propulsive sense of joy, and ""All Roads Lead to Salzburg"" (from the same session) is equally
    fine. Also notable is the exceptional sound quality of these recordings; the live mix of this large band
    with the blend of studio and electronic instruments had to be problematic, but the result is clean, clear
    and appropriate to the detailed music.</p><p>
    
    More impressive still is the four-part ""Open Air Dance,"" recorded with the same band at another BBC date.
    Building from a riff laid down on the cheng, the band, shoved forward by the furious drumming of Scharin,
    explores variation after variation on the opening theme, squeezing melodic juice from a tiny three-note
    phrase as clouds of vibe harmonics expand and recede. This collective is all about the positive vibe and
    there's no denying a whiff of 'jam band' is present in the structure of this epic piece. Fortunately, the
    melodies are short and simple, and the launching point for the soloing is primarily rhythmic, so Mice Parade
    never approaches instrumental indulgence.</p><p>
    
    Beyond the live tracks, there are a few experiments that come close to the 'closet cleaning' category, but
    manage to remain appealing. Among these mish-mashes are ""One Road Led to Columbia"" and ""Circle 2,"" both
    pieced together in the Bubble Core office by tweaking and manipulating live fragments via computer, resulting
    in an interesting digital spin on acoustic sound sources that owes a lot to dub. And the new ""Phasen Weise""
    is a fantastic track that would have been the best thing on <i>Mokoondi</i>, with Pierce handling his usual
    array of instruments and then layering the haunting multi-track vocals of Doro Tachler on top, doing an odd
    kind of German folk chant.  <i>All Roads Lead to Salzburg</i> is a fine collection and one hell of an
    advertisement for Mice Parade's live show.</p></div>"|5259.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5259-all-roads-lead-to-salzburg/|7.8|Mark Richard-San

    only more straightforward.  Okay, there's the review, can I go now?  What?
    You want more than that?  Alright, let's see.</p><p>
<i>With Fingers Crossed</i> is the debut EP by Isaac Lekach, an unassuming
    Illinois resident who prefers to go by the stage name Poulain.  But rather
    than playing the conventional singer/songwriter troubadour, he surrounds
    himself with like-minded friends for a fully fleshed indie-lite sound that
    carries his sleepy melodies to you on a bed of understated drums and gentle
    keyboard tones.</p><p>
    
    The aforementioned similarity to Magnetic Fields isn't so much a sonic one
    as it is atmospheric-- Poulain's sound is definitely more hi-fi, despite being
    recorded in the home of producer/keyboardist Chris Holmes.  The four songs
    here don't display a terrible amount of range, all falling squarely in the
    midtempo range and consisting of the same instrumentation.  Instruments
    motor along in slavish service to the melodies, taking pains not to
    distinguish themselves too greatly.  Occasionally, backing vocalist Erin
    Gipson will chime in to support Lekach, but she fits right into the
    production tapestry like just another line in the plaid.</p><p>
    
    Given that Lekach's mellow, unhurried delivery means that his own voice
    doesn't really stand out much either, and what the whole EP comes down
    to is fifteen minutes of pleasant sonic wallpaper.  As a lyricist, Lekach
    is still developing, though there are indications that something better
    sleeps inside him, as evidenced by lines like, ""I feel like I can do
    anything tonight, like a fighter jet crossing enemy lines,"" in ""Hollywood.""</p><p>
    
    By and large, though, he concerns himself less with association and metaphor
    and more with stargazing nostalgia and romance.  Opener ""Red Rover"" reminisces
    about sitting in a car with a girlfriend, listening to <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>
    and gazing at the stars while parked next to a planetarium.  ""Every Night Burning
    Bright"" has the best melody of the bunch, contrasting short, quick phrases with
    long, drawn-out ones for some semblance of catchiness, though it doesn't really
    stick around long after the song ends.</p><p>
    
    But there are very few legitimate complaints you could level against <i>With
    Fingers Crossed</i>.  None of it's actually bad, but it's not especially good,
    either.  The sameness of each of the songs ultimately damns the EP to being
    pretty unmemorable, which in turn has damned me to trying to write a lengthy
    review of something that's pretty easily summed up in a couple of sentences.
    If there's to be any hope for Poulain in the future, it's going to require,
    at the least, an injection of variety.</p></div>"|6441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6441-with-fingers-crossed-ep/|5.8|Joe Tangari

    Grandpaw: You look afeared, Boy-boy. What's irkin' you?</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Nothing.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Come on, now, spit it out. Don't mock my gift of discernment.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Grandpaw... is it okay if I like keyboard music?</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Hmph. Thought we already had this discussion. You not supposed to fool with that rubbish. You from the
    hills. They got hills in heaven. I ain't heard tell of no synthesizers being in heaven. Sometimes I swear
    you don't have the sense the good Lord gave a toggle bolt.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Those CDs you took from me, could I have them back?</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Look, now. I lost your sister Fern to that keyboard music in the 80s. And I had to bury your brother Coy
    to save him from its techno spawn. You're all I got left. I can't have you miming the piano thing from
    Erasure's ""Blue Savannah"" on the hearth and stashing copies of Depeche Mode's <i>Some Great Reward</i> in
    the churn. That music'll have people thinking you're a... invert. Like when you went to the city and came
    back with a pocketbook.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: That was an eelskin attaché, Grandpaw. And I aim to live in the city one day.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Where'd you cotton to keyboards anyway? Did you get this idea off that blasted landscaping website?</p><p>
    Boy-boy: No. Pitchfork only half-vouches for the Faint and Stars and Vitesse. And they said the new-wavey Trans Am
    and Hefner were no good. They'd hate this unironic, sometimes daft, celebration of pure digi-retro swizzle.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Them boys at Pitchfork can sniff how faddish it all is, see, how it won't hold up over the years. They
    must have the gift of discernment like me.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: They're not all boys, Grandpaw. And I don't care what they say; I like it all. I snuck this CD past you.
    Look.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Well, great day in the goddamn morning. <i>This Is Tech-Pop</i>. Where'd you get this stinkbiscuit?
    Let's see what the helpful booklet says: ""These are good-looking acts that have a strong fashion sense and
    are really fuckable."" That's just impudent.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Yeah, the liner notes are superficial and coarse. I apologize. Don't keep reading. The author goes on to
    link tech-pop's rise to the recession and terrorism.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Your mama always said bad things come in threes.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: I mean, get blitzed to counter terror? Talking Heads and Radiohead, in ""Life During Wartime"" and
    ""Idioteque,"" at least pointed out the ironies of clubbing as a means of escaping having to fathom
    catastrophe. I dig these synths and beats, but I don't know about advocating conscious denial and
    aggressive neglect. ""This ain't no disco...""</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Who you talking to? You're alienating the hell-crust out of me as bad as some of these names.
    Fischerspooner?</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Their song announces itself too much. Music has to do more than just <i>arrive</i>. Overrated.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Zoot Woman?</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Their lite song is ugly. Mouthwashy. Should accompany the wholesome/titillating scene in a Freddie Prinze
    Jr. movie when he touches toes in the pool with the busty virgin. The only song worse is Crossover's bratty,
    redundant contribution.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Freddie Prinze has a kid?</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Some of the songs here are swell, though. FC Kahuna and Selway do the most with their bleepity riffs, and
    Console, Tomcraft, and Mirwais use so many awesome vocal effects that they sound like lovelorn Decepticons.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Hey, now, use some words that make some good common horse-gumption. What is a Ladytron supposed to be? I
    think your cousin Plovis ordered one of those.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Ladytron chucks out the umpteenth remix of ""Playgirl."" Electro-yawn. But so many of the other
    female-vocalists' songs are close to terrific: Circ's ""Destroy She Said"" is one of those hits you
    accidentally memorize on first listen, and Swayzak's ""State of Grace"" is dopey, but inescapable.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: One word: brainwashing, or as Reverend Bagwell says, ""lasting attitudinal change.""</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Soviet's ""Candy Girl"" is pure mid-period New Order.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Don't you get it? New Wave, New Order, New Age. Heathenry is afoot. Devilment with a Korg instead of a
    Ouija.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Please, just listen to it.</p><p>
<i>[20 songs and 78 minutes later, after a hacking cough and Grandpaw cursing about asbestos tiles...]</i></p><p>
    Grandpaw: The hour of vengeance must be at hand. I felt lobotomized by that seventh song that kept saying
    ""genedefekt, genedefekt."" All these people's names are going on my list.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: But some of them were using guest vocalists, and some of them record under different names, and
    some of them are producers more than recording artists.  You'd never track these people down, Grandpaw,
    they live all over the world.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Sounds like Babel. Like a chaotic orgy. And I recognize that song ""Sunglasses at Night,"" from the 80s
    when that stuff got its hooks in your sister Fern.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Yup, the novelty insta-fades on that cover. Did you like any of the songs?</p><p>
    Grandpaw: ""Naked, Drunk, and Horny"" was fine by me. Yellow Note Vs Pukka, whatever that is, recreated a scenario
    we all enjoy. And I like that she was building stairs by hand, and she talked about lumber and nails. I got
    goose-chills to that line, ""I'll wear sawdust instead of clothes."" Most of this music is so divorced from
    anything organic it makes me wanna shoplift a banjo just to feel the wood. Tech-pop seems awful environmentless
    to me; you could never distribute mulch or pot azaleas to it. This is for those coiffured and hermetically
    sealed people who never sweat. It's car-commercial-core. My second favorite: ""Rippin Kittin"" by Golden Boy
    with Miss Kittin. About murder, so I liked that, especially that line, ""Daddy, can I go out and hunt tonight
    like you do?"" She's not just pulling your leg, she is ornery!</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Great taste, Grandpaw! Those are two of the best tracks.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: I noticed that a couple of them went tst-chicka instead of the predominant oom-chicka.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: That's microhouse.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Like a outhouse?</p><p>
    Boy-boy: No sir.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Like a microwave?</p><p>
    Boy-boy: No sir.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Foot! Confound it! I don't have time for nonsense.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Didn't you like how the CD is cleverly choreographed so that each song evolves into the next one, creating
    a super-juhhamm!</p><p>
    Grandpaw: That just made it all run together more, to me. What's so '21st century' about this? It's that same stuff
    as that Yaz and that Gary Numan.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Granted, almost every style-revival is more homogenous than its predecessor. This disc is monochromatic
    compared to the old-school punk-dance <i>In the Beginning There Was Rhythm</i> comp. And come to think of it,
    there's not a lot of experimentation with the formula. But the album never promised difficult art, it
    promised that ""This Is Tech-Pop."" Which turned out to be straight talk. I mean, that's more honorable than
    naming a movie something grandiose like <i>Reign of Fire</i> when it should have been called <i>Some Dragons
    at Fourteen-Minute Intervals</i>. This, thankfully, isn't a Tupperware comp of leftovers, but it's also not
    pushing its genre's boundaries. It's an audience-widener, designed to work like hypertext-- you link and
    click off into the catalogs of the best acts. There are winners on this comp, but if the genre stays at this
    level, it'll have to be renamed Coleco-Bubble.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: You're starting to sound like that Rakepoke website.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: I wish. If one of the Pitchforkers reviews this CD, I bet that slut will listen to it and enjoy it a lot
    more than his 'critical' rating indicates.</p><p>
    Grandpaw: Simmer down. Finish your chicken waffles. And give me a sip of that crayfishberry milkshake. I'll take a
    hickory switch to your hide if you don't forswear that tech-pop and them rank city dreams.</p><p>
    Boy-boy: Yessir.</p></div>"|1937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1937-this-is-tech-pop/|7.0|William Bowers

They're that nasty.  You may like their music, but don't forget that they hate
    you.  You didn't do anything; they're just sick of your bullshit.  And what're you gonna say back?  The
    singer's a towering, lanky Australian named Angus-- that's Scottish for ""Bubba""-- and the music's a gray
    nightmare of art-punk and noisy beats.  It's vicious, but you can dance to it!</p><p>
    
    No matter how much buzz they draw-- appearing on the John Peel show, touring with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs,
    having their debut re-released on Blast First-- the Liars will stay hostile and insidious.  They make what
    I can only describe as cyborg junkyard rock.  Guitarist Angus Hempell plays messy power chords and
    high-pitched, lobotomizingly zen-like guitar lines, but he also has a drum machine: dig ""Mr. You're on
    Fire Mr.,"" where he sticks programmed fills where you'd expect guitar riffs.  The lo-fi electronics and
    sound effects that pervade the album give it a rhythmic kick, but while other artists try to make samples
    sound human, the Liars work to sound hypnotically mechanical.  On ""Nothing Is Ever Lost or Can Be,"" they
    lurch and march-step to jerky high notes and tumbling drum fills.</p><p>
    
    Angus Andrews is impenetrable, showing the emotional range of a matchbook: he's either flat or flared.
    His sing/shouting switches from weary to angry and back again, and just try to make sense of the splintered,
    hostile lyrics he spits like rat poison: ""They cut me up they cut me up they cut me up they cut me up they
    cut me up at the medical school.""</p><p>
    
    It's up to bassist Pat Nature and Ron Albertson on ""friendly drums"" to reign in the noise, and Nature puts
    all the torque into the band: listen to ""We Live NE of Compton,"" where the bassline kicks it into a killer
    dance-punk number; and to see his modest side, check out how his steady rumble keeps ""Loose Nuts on the
    Veladrome"" together while the rest of the band buzzes off in every direction.  He's the reason it's
    impossible to write about this band without comparing them to Gang of Four-- that post-punk tendency to
    impale rage and noise on the sharp edge of a floor-beating rhythm.</p><p>
    
    But sticking with that would be too easy.  Every time the Liars bust out a stone-cold party favorite, they
    answer it with a track that feels like sticking your head in a vice.  ""Tumbling Walls Buried Me in Debris""
    is disorientingly repetitive, with a sinking, introverted melody, zen-like chimes and an eerie beat that
    sounds like the delusion-sequence music from a P.O.W. film: Charlie's got us gagged and bound and tortured,
    and nobody gets out of here without a migraine.</p><p>
    
    I've played <i>They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top</i> a dozen times in the last couple
    days, and I get something different each time.  Sometimes I find new sounds; sometimes I feel like I get
    less out of it with every listen.  It's not clear where their tactics are going, whether it'll come together
    on the next album, or whether this fragmented style is the thing that makes them great.  In fact, all that
    <i>is</i> clear is that it's rare that a band rocks this hard and still challenges you at every turn.</p><p>
    
    The last track is the final showdown.  ""This Dirt Makes Mud"" is a drawn-out slide of grinding, throbbing rock
    with Andrews moaning and shouting while Hempell squeaks and squalls and Nature rumbles menacingly underneath.
    In direct opposition to the brief songs on the rest of the album, this is a rock epic, but here's the trick:
    the music doesn't stop.  At roughly the moment any other song here would end, the band fades into a
    four-second loop, and once the machine's going, they take off and get a beer while it plays over, and over,
    and over, for more than twenty minutes.  You can leave whenever you want, but then you're quitting before
    the album does.  Maybe this is a statement, maybe they're killing time, and maybe it's just the sound of a
    band crawling up its own ass.  But when's the last time a record dared you to blink first?</p></div>"|4764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4764-they-threw-us-all-in-a-trench-and-stuck-a-monument-on-top/|8.1|Chris Dahlen

    and Spice Girls) with cloying string arrangements. But his stock-in-trade is moody, gargatuanly stringed
    incidental music for hysterically overblown movies like <i>Moulin Rouge</i> and <i>Plunkett and MacLean</i>.
    The appropriately titled <i>As If to Nothing</i> follows on from his 101-Strings-for-Jaded-Dullards debut,
    <i>The Space Between Us</i>, and repeats the same formula throughout its sixty-nine minutes, just as its
    predecessor did.  Though some might say that Armstrong's music is powerfully evocative and serene, such
    people hate music and all its subtle possibilities and intricacies.  Plus, if Armstrong perceives that music
    can be subtle, intricate and meaningful, this album goes strenuously out of its way to demonstrate the
    opposite.</p><p>
    
    An Armstrong piece is short and unobtrusive, which, for movie producers, means Armstrong's an affordable
    alternative to James Horner or John Williams. While no director really wants an audience distracted by a
    heavenly orchestral piece from his or her images, I expect something more eventful for home listening than
    billows of strings interrupted in the politest way by French horns or a soaring oboe.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps aware of the limitations of his instrumentals, Armstrong enlisted help: drum-n-bass master Photek,
    soul crooner David McAlmont, Alpha vocalist Wendy Stubbs, Antye Greie-Fuchs from German glitchers Laub,
    Bono, Mogwai and even Lemonheaded lost boy Evan Dando took time out from their otherwise productive lives
    to take part in this effete twaddle.  Rumor has it that a small town was built to house and support all the
    musicians involved in realizing Armstrong's bland vision. Divided into two camps: hundreds of Musicians'
    Union schlubs, and those star performers the liners classify as ""featured artist."" But anyone wandering
    into Armstrong's shanty town could distinguish the two classes by whether they had a limo pick them up from
    their temporary accommodation or whether they had to ride Shank's pony to the studio.</p><p>
    
    Once seated in front of the music stands, the majority of the performers probably chuckled at how childishly
    simple Armstrong's score is, and how repetitious. All string players are asked to play languidly and high,
    piling on mock emotion by the shovelful. Horn players are similarly asked to underpin the insipidly swollen
    string gestures with mannered blasts. Percussion is left to programmers, who borrow heavily from Massive
    Attack's <i>Mezzanine</i> loops.</p><p>
    
    Any discerning listener must hope that the ""featured artists"" will crack through the sickly sweet monotony.
    The juxtaposition of sweeping strings and Mogwai could have been fascinating, had Mogwai's contribution not
    been erased in post-production. I can detect no trace of them during ""Miracle,"" the piece on which they're
    credited.  Photek suffers identically.  I'm at a loss to find Photek amid the generic trip-hop beats of
    ""Hymn 2,"" and the addition of soprano soloist Catherine Bott to the track makes it seem as though Armstrong
    constructed this song solely for those wishing to augment their Enya and Enigma collections. Despite
    Armstrong declaring in a <i>Guardian</i> newspaper interview that Antye Greie-Fuchs' band Laub are
    reminiscent of Stockhausen, he (maliciously?) reduces her vocals to exotic curiosity during ""Waltz."" Fuchs
    babbles away in German and occasionally English making no sense and leaving the majority of listeners with
    a very dim view of her mental health.</p><p>
    
    Bono gets to redo his vocals for U2's chestnut, ""Stay (Faraway, So Close),"" and reveals that despite his
    striving for Scott Walker's baritone, the best he'll ever achieve is Michael Bolton's. David McAlmont,
    former Thieves vocalist and collaborator with ex-London Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, fairs far better,
    which really is damning him with faint praise. During ""Snow,"" McAlmont taps into the powerful soulful
    pathos that made songs like ""Yes"" (from <i>The Sound of McAlmont and Butler</i>) such stunners.  But again,
    Armstrong bludgeons McAlmont with the orchestra, perhaps out of jealousy. McAlmont is capable of real emotion,
    not Armstrong's ersatz approximation of feeling.</p><p>
    
    I find Armstrong's successful career bewildering, given the extremely narrow musical ability he displays
    throughout this album. A case in point is ""Starless II,"" a piece that incorporates a chunk of Robert Fripp's
    guitar solo from King Crimson's ""Starless."" The extent of Armstrong's ability is to mimic exactly the notes
    Fripp plays in the string section, which is a stultifying waste of everyone's time. The strings attach
    themselves like barnacles to Fripp's guitar and refuse to be shaken loose.  Another instrumental, ""Ruthless
    Gravity,"" demonstrates just how conservative an electronic label Astralwerks can be. Token blips begin the song
    before a deluge of syrupy unison strings shove the sound of the new out of the way. For me, ""Ruthless Gravity""
    typifies Astralwerks' partially concealed loathing of innovation. Just one look at their roster and you'll
    see example after example of shoddy talent and crummy back-in-the-day-ism.</p><p>
    
    Despite the prevalence of vapid schlock, <i>As If to Nothing</i> displays one genuine surprise in Evan Dando.
    Dando brings a maturity and sensitivity that I had hitherto not suspected he was capable of. Though the song,
    ""Wake Up in New York,"" lifts sections from Kate Bush's ""Moments of Pleasure,"" Dando's reserved solemnity
    gives <i>As If to Nothing</i> a grace it doesn't deserve. Armstrong does superbly to restrain himself from
    augmenting Dando with anything but an acoustic guitar for the first fifty seconds. But inevitably, Armstrong
    wants the spotlight trained back on him and lobs string salvoes to crush Dando's affecting delivery.</p><p>
    
    The title <i>As If to Nothing</i> fits this execrable CD perfectly. Putting aside for a moment Armstrong's
    neutering of his ""featured artists,"" what galls me is his rootlessness. I can detect no affiliation with or
    reference to any classical tradition. I'm not asking him to wave the Darmstadt or Vienna gang sign, but at
    least show an awareness of the intricacies of composition other than those mandated by the Muzak Corporation.
    Though this record courts an audience who despises creativity and innovation, it will disappoint even them
    by not giving them a single decent melody to hum along to. At least Moby gave his audience ""South Side"" and
    ""Porcelain.""</p><p>
    
    The dominant force of any Armstrong piece, the strings, are a unified mass, undifferentiated and relentless
    in their turgid banality. They move like a column of artillery, crushing any small beauty beneath their
    lumbering feet. Such tactics work splendidly for tender moments in a Michael Bay picture (surely Armstrong's
    next outing), but they have no place in any music collection.</p></div>"|292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/292-as-if-to-nothing/|2.2|Paul Cooper

How's everything?  How are all the
    trees?  Good?  Glad to hear it.  How's the old national self-esteem doing?  Only reason I ask is that I've
    been seeing all these ""Made in Canada"" stickers on things lately.  This little plea for attention just seems
    kinda... desperate, you dig?  Don't worry, man; we haven't forgotten about you.  Do you feel like we've been
    neglecting you down here?  Why, suddenly, is there this need to be all like, ""Hey!  Remember Canada?  We make
    things!""  It just worries me, that's all.  You're like a washed up actor desperate for work, attaching your
    name to anything that crosses the border.  Have you heard some of these CDs you've given your precious
    Canadian blessings to?  Well, it happens that I've got one of the steaming piles that you've so lovingly
    manufactured right here.  It's <i>Mortal Mirror</i> by Quix*o*tic, and if it isn't a reason to reconsider
    pimping out your national pride on just anything, I don't know what is.</p><p>
    I was kind of worried from the get-go-- I don't need to tell you that the all-girls-plus-testosterone-infused-drummer
    thing is rapidly flirting with becoming another indie-rock cliché.  But at least Mick Barr plays bass instead
    of drums, and Christina and Mira Billotte are sisters, so it's kind of a wash.  The album art, a photo by
    Barbara Billotte, immediately made me wonder just when it was that Kill Rock Stars began signing Goth acts,
    but, ever conscientious and objective, I simply recalled that no matter how famous Richard Meltzer might be,
    you can't judge an album solely by its cover art.</p><p>
    O, Canada, if only my fears had been dispelled.  I was hoping my concerns were unfounded, but it was downhill
    from the moment I spun the disc.  You should have nipped this in the bud, Canada-- I didn't know what I was
    in for.  ""Ice Cream Sundae"" plodded lifelessly at me, nothing but irritatingly repetitive bass and off-key,
    apathetic vocals.  It was stark, minimal, and frightfully unpleasant, and even though it was punctuated with
    a playful guitar solo motif, that wasn't enough to salvage such an ugly skeleton of a tune.  Was she actually
    singing, ""Walking through a circus of/ Bloody ghouls and perfect fools/ Stupid little people who/ Think that
    they make all the rules""?</p><p>
    I persevered against all better judgment, although by the third track, it was becoming alarmingly clear that
    this was little more than some copped blues riffs and traditional arrangements laced with misplaced folk-goth
    atmospherics and vaguely surfy guitars.  It tasted like the recipe for musical Ipecac; things looked grim.
    How many times could they recycle weird, bass-heavy variations of ""The Worms Crawl In, the Worms Crawl Out""
    with a funeral march arrangement (""Open Up the Walls"") and a surf instrumental arrangement (""Mortal Mirror"")?
    At times, they did manage to sound a little like some of the sparsest, most low-key offering from art-rockers
    Blonde Redhead (a compliment.  Also, both bands were produced by the estimable Guy from Fugazi.  Coincidence,
    or phenomenon?), but without any of the flare or vitality (not a compliment).  The dismal trudge through the
    aural mud of <i>Mortal Mirror</i> wouldn't be easy, but duty called.</p><p>
    Then, a shock!  Track six... what was it?  ""Sitting in the Park"" arrested with a pop bassline straight out of
    a slow crooner from the 50s, and vocals to match.  The one thing I can say about Quix*o*tic is that the vocal
    performances of the Billottes (they trade back and forth) were often quite beautiful, showing a great deal
    of range while maintaining enough ethereality to pass without a trace (if only the lyrics weren't so terrible).
    Christina's work on ""Sitting in the Park"" was astounding, and for once, the musical backdrop for her voice
    was up to the task.  I wasn't surprised to discover, then, that it wasn't theirs.  No, it was originally by
    Billy Stewart, and along with ""Tell It Like It Is"" by Aaron Neville and ""Lord of This World"" by Sabbath
    (Black Metal 4-Eva!), it was in a class by itself from the rest of <i>Mortal Mirror</i>.  Bad band, good
    covers, imagine that shock.</p><p>
    O, Canada, you know I love you and I'm only trying to look out for you.  Why did you do it?  Why export
    Quix*o*tic and then stamp your good name all over it?  Sure the covers are uniformly excellent, but that has
    a little something to do with the fact that they were written by other people.  At the very least, it seems
    to me that if you listened to even one of the originals off this album, you'd want to keep your involvement
    as much of a secret as possible.  It's not like you don't have plenty of fantastic national treasures to be
    proud of.  It's misleading, anyway!  Quix*o*tic are from Washington, D.C.!</p></div>"|6598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6598-mortal-mirror/|3.6|Eric Carr

Now that Wilco is being inaugurated as heir to those bands, the race is accidentally     on to be Wilco. Which is not to imply that Wilco is done being Wilco, just that they've become Wilco the     Superentity, the much-prophesied ""American Radiohead"" that Modest Mouse was supposed to become, leaving a     sizable gap where Wilco the mere Respectable Act once was. The re-release of these 1998 and 2000 records by     Minnesota's Mason Jennings are evidence that he's poised on the brink of a brink: he could assume a lofty     role at the pre-infallibility level of Tweedy's outfit, or he could plop into the nutrasweet realm and get     stuck between Dave Matthews and Eagle-Eye Cherry. Even his name rides the fence, sounding as much like a     wizened troubadour as it does the snobby soccer-prick from high school who wore his shinguards to study     hall.</p>
<p>The following consumers should take note of Mr. Jennings, assuming you've clung to some disposable income:     fans of Hayden's upbeat moments, My Morning Jacket's cheesy moments, or Simon Joyner's short-winded moments,     as well as fans of earnest acoustic Beck, and Royal City when they meander. Be warned, though, he poses for     photos in fields with horses, leaning his guitar against his leg. I'm just saying. I want to be all perma-cool     aesthete and slap Jennings down, but he's hard not to like as long as you aren't expecting lyrical profundity.     What he's got is an original voice, an obtuse thing with look-Ma-no-youth heft that brings to mind, but does     not sound like, sirs Farrar and Oldham. I would have mentioned young Dylan, but I have to deny the messianic     delusion of Jennings' diehard fans (many, many of which, by the way, are heterosexual females, no doubt     piqued by how well the self-consciously cute performer fits alongside Ryan Adams and Jeff Buckley in     sideburn-themed CD collections).</p>
<p>But to harp on the voice. It can be bulbous, then he can deflate it into a wisp. It can swagger, then go     butt-naked love-whipped. The intonations can fluctuate within songs; words burp and then sail. On ""Godless,""     this cracker manages to sound, well, black. The song begins in a kind of yard-stomp and builds to a wailing     punk anthem, a two-minute cross-section of all the years between the Smithsonian Anthology of American Folk     Music and Stephen Malkmus' fetching brat-yelp. One thing Jennings' voice doesn't do well is get defiant-- a     few of the in-yo-face bits come off a mite windy.</p>
<p>The debut is a tight batch of love songs, during which Jennings isn't afraid to throw the eff-word into the     most radio-friendly ditties. Classic songwriter hyper-self-referentiality is abundant here; the speakers use     constructions equivalent to ""as for <i>me</i>, I feel like I verbed <i>my</i> noun."" Perhaps this is germane     to the glaze of cosmic significance that lovers project, a quantity that peaks during the refrain of the     otherwise sublime ""1997"": a couple perceive themselves to be at the center of a supernatural event. This is     a tuneful, unpretentious record that allows some of its songs room to switch tempos or throw in some     dissonant acoustic-skroid a la the Violent Femmes.</p>
<p>On <i>Birds Flying Away</i>, Jennings dares to bring the party down by whipping out his politics and God and     Jesus. A lot. The album opens in medias res with the great line ""And with the world comes misery,"" includes     a song from a woman's perspective and one about people coming down from mountains with birds trapped in their     minds (mere coincidence, I suppose, that a rare Neutral Milk Hotel track boasts a very similar topic), and     ends with a pulsing, extended, screaming, clang-jam. ""Black Panther"" bursts into a horn section, and ""Stars     Shine Quietly"" (as opposed to loudly?) is driven by breathy saxes, touches that season the guitar/bass/drum     arrangements. The electric solos are estimable Americana, the brushed drums can be pimp, and some of the     more epic chord progressions are reminiscent of Carter Burwell's soundtracks for Coen brothers films. He     even acquits himself, I think, on two much-maligned white-liberal agit-pop tunes about MLK and Corporate     America. The portentous plucking or reggae-venom doesn't falter, and Jennings is bold to expand his scope     beyond that of acts who can't escape the diary-fodder of 'relationships.'</p>
<p>Did I compare him to enough people? He's a male Edith Frost? If Jakob Dylan was Jakob Waits? If Barry White     were white? If Jesus was into drummy neo-folk and was a ""Dawson's Creek"" regular? If you don't feel up to     deciphering the irony-maze of the Drag City vague-abonds, or if you're a codependent in need of a safe bet     for the closing number on a one-month anniversary mixtape, this man writes a decent guileless, baldly     windswept love song. Still, you might be a hardcore indie-rocker who finds Jennings a tad too convivial.     I admit there's something Corn Flake about him, but nothing that better packaging couldn't surmount. All     he has to do is shave that pubic-testimony lower-lip tuft and get some worthy cover art instead of photos     of himself (a tactic that smacks of Nashville-size idea-lessness). If he got tattoos and a scarf, he'd be     ready to soundtrack a Wes Anderson slo-mo tracking shot. But if he ends up on the soundtrack to <i>Scooby     Doo 2</i>, you never read about him here, my name at the bottom is a mistake, and Rollstone McSpin hacked     his way into our FTP to post this.</p></div>"|11765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11765-mason-jenningsbirds-flying-away/|7.0|William Bowers

    the disorientation left in its wake; the stimulus avalanche we're now subjected to on a daily basis is just
    too much for many of us to capably grapple with.  The Information Age is moving us, step by precious step,
    towards complete omniscience.  But of course, the closer we come to one another artificially, the further
    disconnected we become in the physical world.  Interpol, in the scant three tracks of their debut EP for
    Matador Records, may not be the first to address these themes of distance and loss, but given the present
    state of our society, these anxieties seem more relevant now than at any point since the dawn of the
    post-punk era.</p><p>
    
    Like an antidote to the po-mo dilemma, Interpol convey all the ache of isolation and being driven apart from
    those you care about in just fifteen minutes, then do themselves one better by suffusing each track with an
    unmistakable serenity, reckoning with the problem.  It's a credit to these unsung talents from the wilderness
    of New York that they've been able to craft an EP of such power and grace that all I'm left with is the
    pseudo-intellectual drivel you just waded through.  So enough of my crappy armchair philosophy.  This
    mercilessly brief offering is a tiny, self-contained opus of need and longing, damn near perfect in its
    haunted malaise.  And before I go on, let me also note that it's only three dollars.  Sweet Jesus, I dare
    you to give me a reason to pass on this disc, barring Mafia-related coercion or presidential mandate.</p><p>
    
    Interpol is often compared to the late, great Joy Division, and at a glance, it's not hard to see why.  But
    with deeper analysis, the likening is ridiculous-- Interpol has more in common with the hazy-sweet drones of
    Clinic or the propulsive rhythms and jangling guitars of Mission of Burma than any of Ian Curtis' brooding
    dirges.  Superficially, Paul Banks does sound somewhat similar to Curtis, but only in his compelling delivery--
    not his actual voice-- and certainly not enough to warrant the comparison.  It's only after careful meditation
    that the underlying truth becomes clear: Interpol are reminiscent of Joy Division in atmosphere and brutal
    conviction alone.</p><p>
    
    The instrumentation is tight and dynamic throughout, with elements continually dropping in and out to make
    way for changing progressions as song structures are subtly stripped and rebuilt in synth crescendos and
    warbling guitar washes.  Opener ""PDA,"" the common-knowledge acronym for ""public display of affection,"" is
    just that: a heartfelt, last-ditch plea to save a failed relationship while simultaneously acknowledging the
    futility of the act.  ""You will not reach me/ I am resenting a position that is past resentment/ And now I
    can't consider/ And now there is this distance,"" drives home the message before the band launches into a
    sublime, sweeping chorus, the music reflecting the emotional conflict by fence-sitting somewhere between
    gentle and driven.  ""Specialist"" begins with poppy bass and a sweetly intoned verse until a surly guitar riff
    baby-steps its way into the mix like an elementary school bully slowly making his way across the playground.
    Then he puts you in a hammerlock until you agree to turn your fluffy love poetry into a slightly bent tale
    of devotion and dominance/co-dependence with lines like, ""Time away from me/ Will get you down,"" and, ""Put
    your little hand in mine/ Speak when you're spoken of.""</p><p>
    
    Those two tracks bookend the glorious, lazy soaring of ""NYC,"" a paean to Interpol's embattled homeland
    riddled with mixed emotion.  ""I know you've supported me for a long time/ Somehow I'm not impressed/ But
    New York cares,"" as sung by Banks, demonstrates a touching sincerity.  And still, the constant undercurrent
    of isolation remains in the resignation and weariness of ""I'm tired of spending these lonely nights/ Training
    myself not to care.""</p><p>
    
    From start to finish, Interpol's EP in preparation for their first full-length effort is vast, moving, and
    brilliant.  Each listen reveals new layers, the band's appeal growing exponentially.  The only complaint that
    can be leveled at this disc is that it's just too short, which in itself fulfills the first law of show
    business: always leave them wanting more.  At this early stage, it's hard to know whether or not the success
    of this EP is based on the premise that these are simply the best songs Interpol has to offer.  But if the
    boys can eke out a bargain with Old Scratch himself and pour thirty more minutes of sweet nectar like this
    into a few billion ones and zeros, their souls would certainly be a small price to pay.</p></div>"|4114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4114-interpol-ep/|9.3|Eric Carr

Yeah, he's a really nice guy.  And if
    you pay any attention to this music stuff, you can
    probably figure out from that nugget of information
    what kind of music Gibbard makes.  Nice guys sure
    don't have the necessary bravado for hot hip-hop
    skeelz, nor, usually, the full-bodied mane required
    for properly pyrotechnical metal.  Nope, the domain of
    nice guy music is largely restricted to the domain of
    intelligent, reflective, dare I say emotional guitar
    pop.</p><p>
    Gibbard's usually found trafficking in the full-band
    variation on this theme with his fellow Nor'westers,
    Death Cab for Cutie.  But nice guys generally tend to
    be solitary folk as well (possibly a sub-clause of the
    old finishing-order statement), so it's not all that
    surprising to find that Gibbard has <i>All-Time Quarterback</i>,
    a collection of solo bedroom recordings from 1999, up
    his sleeve.  Split evenly between four-track overdub
    fiestas and one-track, one-take tape recorder ditties,
    the eleven-song mini-LP allows Benjamin to craft some
    saccharine introspections with minimum interference
    from other souls.</p><p>
    Of course, Gibbard's already the lone song supplier
    for DCFC, and according to my media guide, there was
    no difference whatsoever between the preparation of
    these demos and the demos he brings to his fellow
    Cabbies before recording.  So despite attempts to
    follow in the footsteps of fellow go-it-aloners Pedro
    the Lion and the Magnetic Fields (whose ""Why I Cry"" is
    covered), none of these solo apples fall far from the
    full-band tree.  But at least the arrangements are of
    the stripped-down variety, closer to the fireplace
    intimacy of <i>We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes</i>
    than the Big Time drums and production of <i>The Photo
    Album</i>.</p><p>
    These surroundings fit the gentle nature of All-Time
    Quarterback's faux-full-band songs well, the shimmery
    likes of ""Dinner at Eight in the Suburbs"" and ""Rules
    Broken"" benefiting from the minimal Casio rhythms and
    endearingly slipshod drumming.  A strident electric
    piano progression shows Gibbard's hitherto unknown
    resemblance to Ben Folds on ""Untitled,"" and ""Send
    Packing"" explores the tortoise-pace path DCFC would
    set upon with subsequent albums.  In a slightly
    embarrassing turn of events, though, the highlight of
    the album is, in fact, the fairly straight run-through
    of Stephen Merritt's ""Why I Cry,"" with a sunny vibraphone
    riff and Gibbard's skilled female impersonation vocals
    highlighting a songcraft superior to that of its
    neighbors.</p><p>
    Meanwhile, the ultra-minimalist tracks sprinkled
    throughout tend to suffer from their sketchpad
    settings, never really becoming more than mere
    staticky fragments.  Part of the problem is the
    increased focus on the lyrics, few of which feature
    the light touch that keeps the more recent of
    Gibbard's literate lamentations from spiraling off
    into self-pity (for example, ""Cleveland,"" the kind
    of don't-move-away plea he's done better elsewhere).
    The rough draft status of these tracks is also pretty
    apparent (""Underwater"" was later fleshed out for a
    Death Cab seven-inch), marking them as future 25th
    anniversary bonus track fodder rather than stand-alone
    album cuts.</p><p>
    Of course, anybody who doesn't already have a DCFC
    album filed away in their IKEA dïskø tower probably
    doesn't give a whut-whut about All-Time Quarterback
    anyhow, and rightfully so, since nothing on this record
    is exceptional or varied enough to appeal to non-members.
    Aside from keeping your home Gibbard shrine up-to-date,
    the disc serves no purpose for Death Cab haters, unless
    you maybe want to prank somebody into thinking you scored
    advance demos for the new Shins album.  Then again, if
    you would do that, you wouldn't be a very nice guy, and
    Nice Guy Gibbard would probably want nothing to do with
    you anyhow.</p></div>"|116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/116-all-time-quarterback/|6.4|Rob Mitchum

    genius, equal parts Thomas Edison and P.T. Barnum.  Like Edison,
    Coyne is a relentless tinkerer, a visionary experimenteur with a
    sci-fi fetish and a soft spot for odd technologies.  And like Barnum,
    Coyne is a consummate showman-- the hand puppets, the boombox
    orchestras, the oddball short films, the radio-controlled headphones.
    In 1984, Coyne was just another Oklahoma dreamer with an amateurish
    psych-rock garage band and a duffel bag stuffed with thrift-store
    effects pedals; 18 years later, Coyne finds himself in the position
    of following up one of the most universally regarded albums since
    <em>Pet Sounds</em>.</p><p>
    
    So let's just come right out and say it: after the one-two punch of
    <em>Zaireeka</em> and <em>The Soft Bulletin</em>, <em>Yoshimi Battles The
    Pink Robots</em> is a bold and inventive work, brimming with ideas
    and sublime moments of brilliance.  But it's also unfocused and
    top-heavy, a concept album about robots and karate that, somewhere
    along the line, strays into languorous, contemplative songs about
    mortality and death.  Nor does <em>Yoshimi</em> always put the Lips'
    best foot forward-- though Dave Fridmann's production dazzles, the
    overdriven drums and orchestral swoons that characterized <em>The
    Soft Bulletin</em> are often lost in a busy mesh of programmed beats
    and lazy synthstrings.</p><p>
    
    The album gets off to a rollicking start with the winning ""Fight Test,""
    a glossy rumination on the call to duty-- whether that's standing up to
    a playground bully or, as the Lips would have it, an army of rebellious
    androids bent on world domination.  ""If it's not now, then tell me when
    would be the time that you would stand up and be a man?"" Coyne sings over
    a thick buzz of keyboards, bass and an almost hip-hop rhythm, offsetting
    his resolve in the refrain: ""I don't know how a man decides what's right
    for his own life/ It's all a mystery.""  It's a stunning pop song-- easily
    this album's ""Waitin' for a Superman""-- with an intensely memorable melody
    and the conflict of Coyne's internal dialogue resonating positively on many
    levels.</p><p>
<em>Yoshimi</em> takes its first left turn with ""One More Robot/Sympathy
    3000-21,"" a slippery detour into glitch augmented with falsetto choruses,
    reverberating vocals and haywire surges of digital clickery.  ""Unit 3000-21
    is warming/ Makes a humming sound when its circuits duplicate emotions,""
    Coyne sings over a simple bass figure and ambient tones before the song
    explodes in a burst of overdriven clockwork.  It's a dizzying, disorienting
    sound-- but once the novelty wears off, you've gotta admit it sounds a bit
    like Steely Dan.</p><p>
    
    ""Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots (Part 1)"" rides a simple melody and
    ridiculously infectious butt-beat as it sets the stage for the album's
    short-lived 'concept'-- some entertaining nonsense about an army of
    Japanese girls training to take on the salmon-hued robots at a kung-fu
    compound right out of <em>Enter the Dragon</em>.  In the chorus, Coyne
    plays call-and-response with a malevolent synth burble that sounds like
    a malevolent R2-D2.  Its rollercoaster companion, ""Yoshimi (Part 2),""
    scales a slinky, ascending wall of farty synth and distant Japanese
    babble before the bottom falls out, rocketing into chaotic instrumental
    breakdowns each a shade more intense than the last.  It's the closest the
    Lips have come to writing straight videogame music, complete with crowd
    noises and bloodcurdling screams (courtesy of the Boredoms' Yoshimi
    Yokota).</p><p>
    
    And this is where <em>Yoshimi</em> makes its first misstep, on the
    sleepy ""In the Morning of Magicians.""  Though punctuated with bursts
    of instrumental energy, the arrangement quickly devolves into a thick
    lite-FM syrup.  ""What is love and what is hate, and why does it matter?""
    Coyne wonders over a flitty symphony of Muzak strings.  Again, the
    production is flawless-- I especially dig the wavering tape-speed
    fluctuations on the background vocals-- but the song throws the album
    into a downbeat, overly philosophical malaise from which it never fully
    recovers.  What happened to Yoshimi again?  Pink robots... what pink
    robots?</p><p>
<em>Yoshimi</em> shines again with the superior ""Ego Tripping at the
    Gates of Hell,"" which pits more existential lyrics over a far more
    satisfying collage of sounds (vocal samples, snippets of mellotron,
    a lumbering bass).  ""I was waiting on a moment, but the moment never
    came,"" croons Coyne, echoing the issues of readiness and bravery
    ""Fight Test"" raised, but also betraying <em>Yoshimi</em>'s greatest
    weakness: the moment never comes.</p><p>
    
    The closest the Lips do come is on the divine ""Are You a Hypnotist?,""
    if only for the brief return of some actual drums (brilliantly tracked
    to create some glitchy, idiosyncratic fills impossible to play in
    real life).  Coyne indulges in wordplay such as, ""I have forgiven you
    for tricking me again/ But I have been tricked again/ Into forgiving
    you,"" as the song builds to a distorted swell of fuzzy static and some
    otherworldly choir.</p><p>
    
    ""Do You Realize"" buzzes and clangs with overproduction, as Coyne
    breezes through a list of trite observations like, ""Do you realize
    that everyone you know someday will die?"" and, ""Let them know you
    realize that life goes fast/ It's hard to make the good things last.""
    Its parallels with Mike + The Mechanics' ""The Living Years"" are uncanny,
    and believe me, it hurts me more to say that about a Flaming Lips song
    than it does you to read it.  The already unsubtle onslaught of church
    bells, woozy background harmonies, and strings ascends into supreme
    levels of cheese with not one, but two key changes midway through,
    becoming a near-parody of the genuine emotional weight that carried
    <em>The Soft Bulletin</em>.  And the minor-key Beatleisms of ""It's Summertime
    (Throbbing Orange Pallbearers)"" are wasted on more childlike philosophizing:
    ""Look outside/ I know that you'll recognize it's summertime.""  After the
    grandiose, symphonic universalisms of <em>The Soft Bulletin</em>, could
    it be this record's deepest message is ""stop and smell the roses""?</p><p>
    
    Apparently so, as the self-explanatory ""All We Have Is Now"" retreads
    these themes for a third time, albeit with an uncharacteristically
    fragile beauty.  All of this might have some ironic poignancy if, god
    forbid, Coyne were to be diagnosed with some terminal illness tomorrow
    (and indeed, the latter half of <em>Yoshimi</em> was reportedly inspired
    by the death of a Japanese fan).  But in the context of this album,
    <em>Yoshimi</em> simply runs out of emotional punch, having expended its
    boldest moves and most resonant sentiments in the first five songs.</p><p>
    
    Bafflingly, <em>Yoshimi</em> ends with ""Approaching Pavonis Mons by
    Balloon (Utopia Planitia),"" an anticlimactic instrumental punctuated
    with distant vocal warbling, laser-beam bursts, and sudden fanfares
    of trumpet.  It didn't have to be this way, judging from the wealth of
    stronger material widely traded online by net-savvy Lips fans.  The
    evocative ""The Switch That Turns Off the Universe"" (previewed in a 1999
    BBC session) would seem to be a perfect fit with <em>Yoshimi</em>'s
    cautionary tales of techno-doom. Or better yet, the <em>Yoshimi</em>
    outtake ""If I Go Mad/Funeral In My Head"" (now set to appear as a single
    b-side), an instant Lips classic in which Coyne seemingly conjures
    rainstorms, orchestras, and deafening applause on command.</p><p>
    
    Despite this album's disappointing brevity (45 minutes, padded with
    two instrumentals), its dense production and well-crafted melodies
    offer long-term replayability.  Moments like the Coyne-as-robot ""I'll
    get you, Yoshimi"" barely audible in the title track, or the interchangeable
    ""I must have been drifting""/""I must have been tripping"" background vocals
    in ""Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell"" seem tailor-made for bull sessions
    around the alien-head bong.  Though <em>Yoshimi</em> could be considered
    guilty of adhering too strictly to a tried-and-true formula (fast beats,
    slow melodies), it's really the more disparate elements that keep this
    album from building emotionally into a classic.  And so, like a double
    feature of <em>Drunken Master</em> and <em>Terms of Endearment</em>, or a
    surprise party where the surprise is that your best friend has cancer,
    ultimately <em>Yoshimi</em> is kind of a bummer.</p></div>"|3081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3081-yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots/|8.4|Will Bryant

Have
    they surmounted their Royal Pussy stereotype to put together a dope
    hip-hop LP?  Has the day finally come where Brits play on DJ mixes
    alongside Mystikal in a spirit of unity and black ass? Is New Flesh
    the new savior, the Tiger Woods, if you will, of British beats and
    rhymes?</p><p>
    
    No! Good god, no, are you joking?  Jesus!  That's okay, though; this
    album got my hopes up, too.  Aside from the buoyant packaging hype
    promising 'album of the year' quality, New Flesh also boasts cameo
    spots by two of the best and hottest underground emcees in the game:
    Beans (Antipop Consortium) and Gift of Gab (Blackalicious). The album
    couldn't possibly be anything less than spectacular, could it?</p><p>
    
    Sure it could. As a matter of fact, it could suck. Lightly suck, as
    on a swizzle stick, but suck nonetheless. Problem is, assuming the
    greatness of this one rests on a false inference. Supposing Beans and
    Gift of Gab recorded <i>Understanding</i> by themselves, we'd probably
    have ourselves an all-time classic. Talent doesn't just disappear,
    after all. As it is, though, we have two classic tracks, and a bunch
    of dub/drum-n-bass drivel, melded together with raspy-throated
    dancehall vox and some other booshit (Sade-esque background vocals,
    mechanical beats, utter absence of soul, you know, the usual). This
    stuff is dubby dubby dubby, following in the funky footsteps of
    another Big Dada-ite, Roots Manuva. Oh wait, did I just call Roots
    funky? Pardon my British: I meant ""retarded.""</p><p>
    
    Before you pass on your own piece of <i>Understanding</i>, consider
    this: there <i>is</i> such a thing as a two-song album. System of a
    Down had one of the finest two-song albums in recent memory last year,
    taking those two songs, ""Chop Suey"" and ""Toxicity,"" and magically
    winning top album honors with a few partially respected rock mags.
    Be ye fooled as I, though, and you found out that nothing else on
    that album was even close to decent. Confounding!</p><p>
    
    So consider, then, that <i>Understanding</i> begins its spin with a
    dose of nasty verse on ""Move Slow,"" courtesy of Beans. Tight production,
    even, with a spacy synth vamp and a deep electronic bass groove. Wait
    six more tracks and you'll hear Gab standing at the mic for his turn,
    the smashing ""Communicate,"" with a delivery as fluid and mesmerizing
    as (almost) anything on <i>Blazing Arrow</i>. It's also got a nice,
    pulsing dance beat that fits well with the track; I guess New Flesh
    know how to treat guests. Give 'em good beats, a cup of Earl Grey,
    maybe some scones, clotted cream.  As they say in Manchester: tizzle
    my schnizzle. Or something like that.</p><p>
    
    You are a junkie, you buy. You are not, you don't. Either way, you go
    home with two songs, two songs for the price of 13 (or 14, counting
    the hidden track that JUST SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME). Don't grimace
    and say you were cheated, because now you know. To summarize, you
    now have <i>understanding</i>. And as I deduced as a child,
    understanding is the other half of the battle-- not the 'knowing'
    half, the other one.</p></div>"|5765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5765-understanding/|5.5|Brad Haywood

    is that he made his living designing ringtones for cellular phone giant Nokia.
    Though the rumor turned out to be false, there is in fact a track on this
    record, his debut full-length, titled ""Nokia."" There's not a ringtone to be
    found on it, though; instead, the track consists of a gorgeous flute melody
    augmented by faint analog synth gurgles and spare use of metallic percussion.
    It sounds a lot less like the work of an algorithm-obsessed IDM musician and
    more like the yearning heart of romantic folkie. The fact is that the Goodiepal
    is both of these things, in proportions that vary from song to song, which
    makes for quite an interesting record.</p><p>
<i>Narc Beacon</i> is Goodiepal's first full-length album, but Vester has been
    releasing material since the early 90s, mostly in the form of 7"" singles
    (including many collaborations with Manchester deviants V/Vm) and split EPs
    (including a fantastic 12"" with Opiate.) When DAT Politics asked him to
    contribute something to their fledgling label Skipp, he complied with this,
    a mix of new and previously released tracks. What makes this record stand
    out is that Goodiepal melds his interest in standard instrumentation (he can
    passably play the recorder, flute, keyboard, lute, mandolin and guitar) with
    the more open-ended structures of contemporary electronics. The result is an
    album that occasionally feels quite organic in the acoustic sense, even as
    the sounds and melodies careen about wildly in a way made possible by modern
    sequencing software.</p><p>
    
    Nowhere is this duality more evident than on ""Chupa Chups,"" a track where
    the main melody line is carried by a lute, evoking a medieval atmosphere
    that is toyed with relentlessly as computers have their way with the
    delightfully strumming. At times, the melody is doubled on recorder and
    acoustic guitar provides the chord foundation, but the unpredictability of
    laptop music continually shoves the lead line off course. Cleverly inverting
    these elements is the stunning ""My Robotic Skills Have Failed,"" which is,
    no shit, a five-part a capella composition for vocodered voices, meticulously
    arranged with counterpoint and unusual harmony. You only need to hear it once
    to remember it forever.</p><p>
    
    A few tracks appear to draw inspiration from video games, and these are not
    among my favorites. ""Stomp Naffer"" is certainly an impressive feat of sound
    design, but the sing-songy melodies are too reminiscent of ""Super Mario
    Brothers"" to have any real emotional impact. But these few duffs are more
    than offset by tracks like the heartbreaking brief pair of tracks (only 47
    seconds each) entitled ""Flap Nipper,"" where a chorus of recorders and flutes
    play a melody so gorgeous you want to hold your breath when you listen. All
    told, <i>Narc Beacon</i> is an engaging (and occasionally perplexing) record
    that hints at great talent.  And since a follow-up full-length on Skipp is
    presently in the works, it may reveal itself fully sooner than expected.</p></div>"|3519.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3519-narc-beacon/|7.9|Mark Richard-San

    focused, understandably, on the former's perspective.  After all, Gira has steeped himself
    in the intensity of his musical projects, Swans and the Angels of Light, for the better part
    of two decades.  Matz' work with his own (still extant) band Windsor for the Derby retains
    much less renown.  <i>What We Did</i> marked a shift away from the Swans' thunderous intensity
    and the Derby's dronescapes, towards more conventional pop songwriting.  Now Matz' solo work
    as The Birdwatcher continues the trend.</p><p>
    
    The second in a trilogy of albums, <i>Afternoon Tales the Morning Never Knew</i> follows <i>The
    Darkest Hour Is Just Before the Dawn</i>, and will presumably be complemented by another thematic

    music: progressive song structure, careful development, and a consistent sound environment.  Matz
    plays folky ballads infused with elegant lyricism and pop melodies, like a less spacy version of
    his labelmate Illyah Kuryahkin.  He composes songs with a small array of instruments-- acoustic and
    electric guitars, synthesizers and drums, mostly-- and has a smart sense of restraint.  This,
    unfortunately, is possibly the reason that the album as a whole is kind of dull.</p><p>
    
    ""Afternoon Tales"" opens with ringing chimes much like those of Spanish enviro-folksters Mus, soon
    layered over with acoustic strums and soft, clicking percussion.  Matz breathes over the top a
    sighing ""aaahhh"" that repeats until the mood becomes rather doleful.  Then ""Empty Boat"" clears the
    air with a light, pumping organ groove, and Anna Neighbor backs up Matz with her sweet voice on the
    verses.  The lyrics are easily evocative: ""Flying now, over top of me/ I'm grafted to the floor/
    An empty boat, there's no stopping me/ On the trusting sea, I'm sunken on your shore.""  Complete
    with handclaps, it's a cutesy song, but it also drifts along on a contemplative atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    That vibe gets picked up again on ""A Thousand Ants,"" one of the record's more affecting moments.
    In an interview, Matz mentioned that this song is about Gibsonton, a small town in Florida with
    a higher freak quotient than the usual.  Having been a Floridian for two decades, I'm not sure what
    he means when he sings, ""In the hot Florida sun, you always find what you seek""-- surely one of the
    strange virtues of the state is that there's always yet another townie inlet you've never heard of.
    Backed only by blues chords on the acoustic, Matz' lonesome voice sounds endearingly matter-of-fact;
    it's when his pronouncements are more heavy-handed that he falters.  One song later, on ""Country
    Music,"" he's laboring over a banjo and singing with all dramatic honesty that ""country music never
    lies/ It always tells the truth.""  Right.</p><p>
    
    Overall, <i>Afternoon Tales the Morning Never Knew</i> is competent, and intimate in a way that
    parallels peeping through someone's diary.  Such illicit actions have their downside, though,
    and like the bluster of many personal journals, Matz tackles his subjects too literally at times.
    His delivery is so forced on many of these tracks that it draws your attention away from the
    thoughtful lyrics.  I holed up in a corner office during a lunch break on a demanding day at work
    recently, and decided to give The Birdwatcher one last chance, to catch something I'd maybe missed
    before.  I fell asleep.</p></div>"|718.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/718-afternoon-tales-the-morning-never-knew/|6.1|Christopher Dare

    pivotal figure in Christianity. Before Freestyle Fellowship, the Old Testament of left coast hip-hop
    consisted of either the soon-to-be-played-out gangster funk of Dr. Dre or aloof oddities such as the Digital
    Underground.  With their seminal debut, <i>To Whom it May Concern</i>, Freestyle Fellowship ushered in a
    new era of minimalist, bass-heavy tracks and progressive, socially astute lyrics that incorporated both
    harmonies and spoken word interludes.  Not only did they define the genre's musical aesthetic, they also
    developed the keep-it-underground ethic that has defined the movement. Unfortunately, after reaching a
    pinnacle with 1993's <i>Innercity Griots</i>, the Fellowship were forced to go on a hiatus due to
    Self-Jupiter's incarceration.  Although they reunited briefly in 1998, only one single was released from
    that session, and for eight long years, fans of west coast underground were forced to feed off the scraps
    of inconsistent solo albums and innovatively challenged imitators like Jurassic 5 and Dilated Peoples.</p><p>
    
    When word hit the street that the group was reforming to record what would become 2001's <i>Temptations</i>,
    the hype was so heavy you would've thought they were about to reinvent sex.  Although the universal ridicule
    that greeted that album was a bit overstated, no one could argue that <i>Temptations</i> was anywhere near
    the level as their previous two masterpieces.  The beats were light and forgettable, and although the
    individual verses were still strong, the members didn't stay in synch with one another lyrically, which was
    always a vital essence of the Fellowship dynamic.  Although Freestyle Fellowship had repeatedly promised us
    ""we will never fall the fuck off,"" they appeared to have done just that.  In the aftermath of that colossal
    disappointment, emcee Mikah 9 announced that Freestyle Fellowship had once again disbanded.</p><p>
    
    In light of the dismal chain of events that were to follow, the brilliance of the recently released,
    from-the-vaults collection <i>Shockadoom</i> is bittersweet. Its songs are taken from the aborted '98
    sessions and, while bootlegged on the Internet, have never officially seen the light of day.  Listening to
    this album is like hearing the dark, challenging album we had anticipated from <i>Temptations</i>.  There
    are only eight tracks on this album, including one skit and an extremely brief freestyle offering, but the
    density and uniqueness of each song makes it seems as though this is much more substantial than a long EP.</p><p>
    
    ""Can You Find the Level of Difficulty in This,"" the album's lead-off track, was originally released in '98
    and showcases Freestyle Fellowship at their lyrical best.  Mikah 9 provides what may be the best verse of
    his career, assaulting the uptempo beat with a barrage of mathematical assonance that seamlessly flows off
    his tongue like a phonetic blitzkrieg.  The liner notes indicate each emcee was given thirty minutes to
    write their verses, and after Mikah dropped his first, Aceyalone and PEACE ended the recording session with
    Aceyalone commenting that he ""had got to come with something to match that!""  Apparently, the extra time
    paid off, as Acey's verse is every bit as goosebump-inducing as Mikah's.  He raps, ""Rap rhyme designer/
    Purely Indubitably Excellent Brilliant Intertwiner/ Kinda Off-Beat Off-Center/ Simple yet confusing/ God
    Sunshiner with a Twist/ Can you find the level of difficulty in this?""  As on every other track, the lyrics
    are dazzling.</p><p>
    
    Omid (aka OD), the incredibly underrated producer who was responsible for 1999's bizarre but brilliant
    compilation album <i>Beneath the Surface</i>, supplies most of the album's beats.  His production ranges
    from dark to darker, incorporating equal-parts cool jazz and fuzzy basement hip-hop that results in a
    noirish ambience both foreboding and rhythmic.  Although OD's tracks have elements of '98 trip-hop, its
    grittiness helps it age a bit better than most of that genre's offerings, and at times suggests a missing
    link between the jazziness of early Tribe Called Quest and the industrial soundscapes of El-P.</p><p>
    
    The production on ""Desperate"" is particularly impressive.  A loud, thudding bassline provides a brilliant
    counterpoint to the track's shuffling, jazzy drum loops and perfectly complements the abstract paranoia of
    the lyrics.  By providing such a dark accompaniment, OD seems to be pushing the emcees into a darker terrain,
    a move that produces-- particularly on the first half of the album-- some of the most complex and morally
    ambivalent work of their careers.  It's a lyrical density that was present in some of their earlier material,
    but sorely missing from the lightweight <i>Temptations</i>.</p><p>
    
    For ""We Will Never Fall the Fuck Off,"" a sax player and a trumpeter are added to the mix with very positive
    results.  Freestyle Fellowship has always incorporated a healthy dose of jazz into their tracks, so this
    seems like a very natural progression. And as the track fades out, the horn players reference the sample
    from ""Inner City Boundaries,"" which is a knowing nod to all Fellowship devotees.  Unfortunately, the track's
    lyrics are of the boring braggadocio variety that tainted much of west coast hip-hop from that particular
    era.</p><p>
    
    That minor lyrical misstep aside, <i>Shockadoom</i> is absolutely brilliant.  The energy and creativity here
    is on par with anything from either <i>Innercity Griots</i> or <i>To Whom It May Concern</i>.  And it makes
    one wonder what would have been possible if Freestyle Fellowship could've stayed together long enough to
    record a full length in '98, and not waited until 2001 when the synergy between the four emcees had diminished.</p></div>"|3190.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3190-shockadoom/|8.4|Sam Chennault

Legend has it
    that when the planets come into a very careful misalignment, and the economic climate is just so, it's
    possible for one of those seminal, gone-but-not-forgotten punk bands of yesteryear to rise from
    the ashes.  And now, as the mighty, infinite cosmos would have it, it's Wire's turn to have a go at
    resurrection.  It's a risky prospect-- one that so often detracts from the legacy of legends-- but if
    they succeed, they prove themselves beyond any talent we could ever have conceived they originally
    harbored, because to re-enter the rock-making fray after 11 years of silence spells certain doom for
    anyone except the truly mighty.</p><p>
    
    If you're acquainted with any Wire beyond ""Eardrum Buzz"" or ""Outdoor Miner"" from some awkward punk
    compilation, feel free to play through, but as minority whip for my Rock Historians Union local 154, I'm
    obliged to inform the uninitiated.  When punk first crossed the Atlantic and crash-landed in England, Wire
    hit the ground running, and as the flag-bearers for the artier end of the movement, they strip-mined pure
    gold from its crusty veins while scores of imitators simply half-assed it Sex Pistols-style.  <i>Pink Flag</i>,
    to this day one of the finest statements the genre ever produced, was followed by the more experimental
    <i>154</i> and <i>Chairs Missing</i>, proving that Wire had eclipsed the limitations of mere punk.  But
    rather than burn themselves in effigy as many of their contemporaries seemed content to do, they soon
    bowed out, claiming they'd plain run out of ideas.  It was a move so tasteful it's a wonder that more
    deserving bands haven't done it (I'll give you a second to think of twenty).</p><p>
    
    Of course, Wire didn't completely heed their own advice, coming back from <i>86-91</i> to be swept along
    in the tail-end of the new wave riptide.  But for better or worse, after more than a decade's absence,
    Wire has fired a warning shot of the coming onslaught, and they call it <i>Read &amp; Burn</i>.  By its
    second track, <i>Read &amp; Burn</i> had far surpassed my expectations.  This is indeed the Wire we all
    know and love, but not exactly as they are known and loved.  Here, they've cultivated a sound as lean
    and raw as anything off even <i>Pink Flag</i> (like they decided to forget their instruments all over
    again to get a fresh start), but where there their old songs had a minimal sterility, the hooks on
    this album drip with a wicked venom.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for a sneering cockney accent, but the nasty
    vocal tone and angry, droning guitar buzz employed on most of these six tracks comes as a pleasant surprise;
    old men that they are, what a shock that they can still summon teen rage on a whim.  Any vestiges of their
    old electronic forays have been mostly abandoned, and they take it to the streets with nothing but the basic
    elements of rock: guitars, bass, and drums.  The newer, more aggressive Wire seems like the right tack for
    the boys from across the pond, and they've warmed to the role capably, cutting through all eighteen minutes
    of this EP like an industrial-strength arcwelder through a tub of Parkay.</p><p>
    
    It's comforting to know that beneath it all, though, the same vital, driving energy that Wire has always had
    forms the foundation of this release.  After ten years, ""I Don't Understand"" seems just like a more forceful
    version of ""Brazil,"" right down to the clanging bass and spitfire vocal delivery.  There are echoes of
    ""Reuters"" under the screeching assault of ""Comet"" (albeit echoes of a much, much faster version).
    Fundamentally, Wire's minimal approach is still present in the arrangements, even if it's a little harder to
    detect due to the single, blistering tempo of most of these cuts.</p><p>
    
    ""Germ Ship"" shows up about ten minutes in and immediately shifts the feel of the record, however briefly.
    The bass is set apart from the frantic grind of the guitar work, which relaxes things ever so slightly
    before the disturbing vocals come in.  Whispered as faintly and insidiously as a death sentence before the
    chorus shows up to pull the lever, the track stands out from the pack on vocal strength alone.  It's
    excellent, though admittedly, it's also the least Wire-y offering presented.  For those die-hards, they've
    included ""In the Art of Stopping,"" which almost approaches the ultimate paragon of Wire's career, ""Ex-Lion
    Tamer,"" in sheer anthemic power.</p><p>
    
    Yep, <i>Read &amp; Burn</i> is still Wire, and without even retreading the past.  Instead, they've kept much
    of their essential Wiriness and filtered it through the post-punk filter of years to arrive at sort of a
    hybrid.  It's not going to win them a place in the hearts of Wire fans who can't handle a little change, but
    if not for a need for change, why else did Wire break up in the first place?</p></div>"|8712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8712-read-burn-01-ep/|8.0|Eric Carr

Before this
    little farce goes any further, you've all heard about the ""storm"" of ""controversy"" surrounding the Oxes'
    original album art for <i>Oxxxes</i>.  Oh, you haven't?  Well, it was a joke, perpetrated by the band and
    record label in a well-planned bid for publicity.  The <i>real</i> joke is that it worked.  Put out some
    fliers and postcards exposing some genuine Ox dick and a hot scenester chick, next thing you know you've
    got the sexually frustrated indie geeks worked up in a frenzy of sweat and masturbation.  Kind of brilliant.
    Also, kind of embarrassing.  I find it a little hard to believe that Baltimore, the hometown of John Waters,
    was up in arms over the various sexual exploits taking place on the original cover (still available on
    'collectable' vinyl!).  About the only good things to come out of this manufactured controversy were some
    entertaining signs from the 'protest photos' on the CD cover reading SARCASM DOES NOT EQUAL IRONY and OXES
    SUCK COXES.</p><p>
    
    I bring this up because this sort of despicably lame publicity stunt should immediately worry any sort of
    media savvy consumer (which, of course, you've all proven yourselves to be by coming 'round this hairy old
    website of ours).  This ranks right up there with stunts like Bono going on a ""fact finding"" mission to
    Africa with the Secretary of the Freakin' Treasury, or Elvis ""dying."" And it's not like the Oxes even need
    this kind of help.  Every single review of <i>Oxxxes</i> spends at least a paragraph on this (I win by
    wasting two), which just means less time spent discussing their patented brand of full-throttle metallic
    math rock.</p><p>
    
    But maybe that's just to avoid the task of trying to funnel this sort of wordless aural acupuncture into
    text-- it just doesn't translate.  Describing the Oxes' compositions for two guitars and some industrial
    strength drums as ""instrumental"" trivializes them.  Regular rock bands break the pace of an album with an
    instrumental for a lark; the Oxes, in the grand tradition of the luminaries of Don Cab, make a valiant
    effort at instrumental communication.  Simply calling it ""math rock"" isn't much good, either.  In the
    immortal words of Mr. Waits, the content of <i>Oxxxes</i> is harder than Chinese algebra, and in every
    possible way.  They know when to let the passive intellectualism of math (or, in the case of the Natalio
    Fowler and Marc Miller's smoldering guitar interlacing, calculus) give way to playful Metal God flourishes,
    lest things become too academic.  Like a cathedral constructed entirely out of a monolithic slab of poured
    concrete, <i>Oxxxes</i> is simultaneously complex, stylized structure and dense, dense, dense.</p><p>
    
    So instead of talking about the album, the live show talk gets trotted out.  Everything nice that's ever
    been said about the Oxes' live histrionics is truer than true; they <i>do</i> take full advantage of their
    wireless kits and put on a fantastic show.  The biggest problem with <i>Oxxxes</i>, aside from being just
    not quite as fun as their self-titled debut, is that even when played at organ-rupturing volumes, it doesn't
    give the listener anything to latch on to like a guy barreling through the audience with the intent to
    cause bodily harm does.  ""Boss Kitty"" kicks it out Helmet-style in the opening moments for some good
    old-fashioned, tongue-in-cheek fun; the exultant rhythmic shifts and tricks of ""Half Half &amp; Half"" spark
    precision riff frenzy hot enough to burn the song down to its foundation.  But they certainly don't build
    the kind of fire that made Don Cab such an institution, and god help me, I can't even sing along!  That's
    not to say I can't enjoy <i>lots</i> of instrumental music; I just expect more from it than lyricless rock.</p><p>
    
    Put it this way: Oxes are not the Autechre of rock and roll.  This is an album you can throw on for shits
    and giggles, if that's your thing.  The blistering guitar work on <i>Oxxxes</i> doesn't quite live up to the
    standards they've set for themselves, but it's sick hott and sharp enough to split the atom, not to mention
    a hell of a lot more fun than atomic fission.  But without vocal help, the visuals of a live performance, or
    anything beyond mutating time signatures, this album loses a little something that it can't quite replace.</p></div>"|6076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6076-oxxxes/|6.8|Eric Carr

    the crowd.  There we were, a few dozen of us crammed into the upstairs of
    Charlie's Kitchen in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and I had the luck to be
    smashed in the back, behind a whole bunch of guys twice my height.  I swear
    to God, even if I were seven feet tall, there would always be some guy taller
    than me at a show.  At any rate, the noise was thick and layered, drifting
    between textures, avoiding structure, but still managing to seem perfectly
    well contoured.</p><p>
    
    I managed to worm my way up to the front to see who was crafting all this
    sound, and when I finally got there, I just couldn't believe my eyes.  There's
    this guy on the floor, surrounded by guitar pedals, deep in concentration.  He
    tweaks a knob, he twiddles a dial, he hits a button, and the noise changes on
    his command.  He changes a few patch cords, picks up a microphone and sings
    into it.  You don't hear anything.  Then, a few patch cords and buttons later,
    there's suddenly his voice, warped, mangled, processed and spit back out by
    about a dozen pieces of machinery.</p><p>
    
    The sound is almost indescribable-- like a choir of angels sucked into a
    mechanical hellstorm and mauled by electronic demons.  Soon, the eye of the
    storm approaches as things calm down, and this guy, still down there on the
    floor, picks up the microphone and begins to <i>beatbox</i>, looping these
    little processed human vocal beats in real time to create astounding rhythms
    and driving along his alien textures.  Soon, he's grabbed a guitar from
    behind him and he's layering that, too, lacing little snips of rhythm in
    one at a time before unleashing a swooping lead line over it.  People in the
    restaurant look at him in a mixture of amazement, confusion, and awe, and most
    of them, it's clear, have no idea just what the fuck is going on.</p><p>
    
    Welcome to the world of Tyondai Braxton, a place where the guitar pedal is
    the first stop for any sound that might be on its way to your ear.  On his
    debut album, Braxton essentially recreates the performance that I saw that
    Monday night at Charlie's, and then goes beyond it into territory that's
    only ever been boldly charted by a few.  His realtime method of solo
    improvisation and looping may be a sight to behold, but it's even better to
    hear, and on this debut, he comes across like a veteran of the avant-garde,
    despite a track record that's only begun to run.</p><p>
    
    Braxton opens with three pieces consisting of nothing more than voice and
    guitar through pedals, all created live.  Those laser beam vocal drones I was
    talking about figure heavily at the beginning, but the best moment of the
    entire first third of the disc is the instant when Braxton adds a distorted
    beat and abruptly changes the texture to match it.  In three words, it's
    utterly fucking brilliant.  The third section bogs down a bit, with freakish
    noises panning and careening in all kinds of directions at once, but just
    when you think he's lost it, Braxton hits you with the album's best piece,
    ""Raise Yr Arms &amp; Cross Them.""</p><p>
    
    ""Raise Yr Arms"" is the only piece on the album that includes the contributions
    of other musicians, in the form of Karen Waltuch on violin and Jonah Sacks on
    cello.  Braxton loops multiple guitar parts through his various effects and
    filters and heads for the drums, pounding out a basic rhythm and looping that
    as well.  Various scraping guitar tones swell up and down, and the drums cut
    in and out, allowing the cello and violin to snake through a dissonant limbo
    of guitars.</p><p>
    
    The two pieces that follow are more minimalist, with the ugly, dark guitars
    that sparsely strum their way through ""2am"" reminding me especially of the
    blackest passages of Low's <i>Songs for a Dead Pilot</i>.  This music is slightly
    denser, though, and the little squirms of static that bubble up now and then
    help to unsettle the music even more.  Braxton doesn't employ loops here,
    either, instead playing strictly out of time to keep you guessing when the
    next layer of grime will come your way.  The third installment of the album's
    midsection plays similarly, though there's more electronic disturbance this
    time, and the guitars become seasick from pitchshifting.</p><p>
    
    The album's final third is the most song-oriented swath Braxton offers.
    Whispered vocal loops and intravenous guitars form the basis for the aptly
    titled ""Violent Light Falling Through Shards,"" which explodes with frenzied,
    amelodic strumming on clean electric guitars after a brief buildup.  The
    frenzied boil of the guitars lowers to a simmer on ""Struck Everywhere,"" and
    Braxton, bathed in glowing effects, starts to sing his ass off.  His uniquely
    contoured melody and passionate delivery are haunting to the nth degree, even
    if what he's singing is completely unintelligible.</p><p>
    
    The album closes with ""Hold On to Distance,"" a remarkable song built on
    echoing drums and beatboxing.  A minimal synthline keeps things in place as
    Braxton proceeds to sing what would probably be an overblown anthem in anyone
    else's hands.  He keeps it sparse, adding more and more percussive elements
    as the song progresses, eventually looping its refrain and allowing it
    to become a part of the texture.  His fuzzy guitar chews at the song's
    foundations from every angle, but it never gives way, instead appropriately
    fading away.</p><p>
    
    Fade-outs frequently feel like a cop-out on the part of an artist who just
    didn't feel like writing a proper ending for a song, but here it sounds
    utterly apropos, as this music doesn't really feel like it has a true ending.
    Indeed, I'm hoping it won't be very long before I get to where that fade out
    comes back in.  Braxton is obviously a major talent, and I'm anxious for
    the day when he takes the avant-garde world by storm.</p></div>"|921.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/921-history-that-has-no-effect/|8.7|Joe Tangari

    Rawkus to reclaim its throne, or at least produce another headnoddin' classic. So when they came knockin'
    with the latest addition in their previously excellent <i>Soundbombing</i> series, I plopped down my 15
    bones and held my breath, hoping to be reassured that Rawkus was still a viable, relevant hip-hop label.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, <i>Soundbombing III</i> is about as reassuring as spotting your girlfriend in a porn getting
    gangbanged by AIDS patients.  And the worst part is that, not only does Rawkus seemingly systematically
    undercut its own credibility, but also the credibility of the other formerly 'conscious' emcees that helped
    propel it to prominence in the late 90s.  Q-Tip, Common, Talib Kweli, Pharaoh Monch, the Roots, and Mos Def
    are all dragged down into the heavily commercialized inferno with some of the worst performances of their
    respective careers.</p><p>
    The Mos Def track ""Freak Daddy"" is the most disappointing here. I'm not even sure where to begin describing
    how god-awful this track is, but I will mention that Destiny's Child's Beyoncé Knowles, of all people, shares
    the songwriting credits.  And it's even a sub-par outing for Beyoncé.   To start with, the production is the
    ill-begotten marriage of pointlessly dissonant, over-the-top rock with the stuttered, pimp-swaggering stylings
    of the ever-popular Rockwilder. Mos also makes the unfortunate choice of eschewing his previously conscious,
    poetic lyrics in favor of a more materialistic, straightforward style. At one point he raps, ""Make way when
    my truck rolls through/ Or get rolled over like you was new road.../ Act wrong and get bl-bl-blasted on.""
    Ugh!  If Mos can't come any stronger than this, I suggest that he either retire from the hip-hop game or
    hire himself a ghost writer. Rumor has it that he's placed his hip-hop career on hold while he finishes a
    new movie with Marky Mark (of Funky Bunch fame).  I applaud that decision because, frankly, the Funky Bunch
    have delivered stronger, more lyrically on-point songs than ""Freak Daddy.""</p><p>
    Fellow Blackstar alumnus DJ Hi-Tek contributes ""Crew Deep,"" a surprisingly understated 70s-funk number that's
    really just a relaxed retread of Sugar Hill's ""Rapper's Delight.""   It's pleasant enough until you realize
    that, while Missy Elliot is billed as the guest emcee, Hi-Tek merely uses a sample from last year's hit, ""Get
    Ur Freak On,"" to augment the chorus. And this isn't the only case of blatantly false and manipulative
    advertising.  Although he's listed alongside Styles P. from the Ruff Ryders, Pharaoh Monch only graces the
    mic for the brief chorus of ""My Life"" and leaves the verses for Styles P, who's nowhere near being in the
    same league.</p><p>
    ""What Lies Beneath"" finds former Tribe Called Quest emcee Q-tip further dissolving into a half-assed parody
    of his former self. Although his rhymes aren't quite as jigga-fied as on <i>Amplified</i>, his thoughts are
    random, his flow is stale, and his voice carries a downtrodden inflection that seems to betray his newfound
    apathy and cynicism.  Listening to this song was like watching Muhammad Ali fight Larry Holmes: you shut
    your eyes and pray that the man retires before he further damages himself, but you know there's too much
    money involved for that to happen.</p><p>
    Though I hate to concede anything to this album, I should state that not everything here is complete shit.
    Jonell's ""Round and Round (Remix)"" retains the light and lovely Spanish guitar line of the original, and
    although the verses-- supplied by Method Man, Kool G. Rap, and Pharaoh Monch-- aren't exactly revelatory,
    they are adequate. And R.A. The Rugged Man contributes the album's finest song with the old-skool nostalgia
    track ""On the Block (Golden Era).""  As R.A. references everyone from Slick Rick to the Juice Crew, you find
    yourself wishing for just a little taste of that old-school charm. But really, you're just wishing Rawkus
    hadn't pawned off their name and credibility for the giant glistening crack-rock of pop suckerdom.  You're
    just wishing that you hadn't bought this bummer of an album in the first place and forever tarnished your
    image of your hip-hop heroes. And finally, you're just wishing someone would just turn this shit off.</p></div>"|1961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1961-soundbombing-iii/|2.2|Sam Chennault

    about art, is that true?</p><p>
    
    A: [laughing] Yes, and it's gotten me in quite a bit
    of trouble.</p><p>
    
    Q: Could you explain it for us?</p><p>
    
    A: Well, first of all, it's not the most original of
    ideas.  I actually stole it from Mrs. Hennesey, my
    fourth grade art teacher.  She always used to say that
    there's no such thing as bad art, which, for many
    years, I just wrote off as a meaningless self-esteem
    booster.  But the more I've thought about it, the more
    it makes sense.  So nowadays I say All Art is Good
    Art.</p><p>
    
    Q: All art is good art... intriguing.</p><p>
    
    A: Yeah, it seems like a bold statement, but it's
    really not that crazy.  Any endeavor that strives to
    be art necessarily involves a certain amount of effort
    and thought, and thus has meaning regardless of skill
    level, originality, or audience appreciation.  A
    teenager's doodles in social studies class-- that's
    fine art.  The guy at the bar doing a herky-jerky
    dance to Billy Joel on the jukebox-- that's modern
    dance, whether he knows it or not.</p><p>
    
    Q: So by extension, criticism is irrelevant?</p><p>
    
    A: That's right.  Who is anybody to judge the relative
    worth of an artistic product?  And it's ironic,
    because by writing a criticism, the critic him- or
    herself is also making art! [laughing] But criticism
    is hopelessly subjective, one person's opinion can't
    possibly take into account how every single person
    would perceive a given piece.  To use a musical
    example, take the band Journey.  Journey is <i>reviled</i>
    by music critics everywhere, but my brother and I love
    driving down the coast singing along to ""Any Way You
    Want It"" at the top of our lungs.  It's all relative.</p><p>
    
    Q: Well, if I may give you another musical example,
    what would you say about a band like Oasis?</p><p>
    
    A: That's another band that critics turn their nose up
    to, but they have some great songs.  ""Wonderwall,""
    ""Champagne Supernova,"" ""Supersonic;"" good stuff, but
    universally panned for being too derivative.  There
    are a lot of people out there who don't care how much
    Oasis cops from the Beatles though, they just want to
    hear a good song they can sing along to.  Again,
    relativity.</p><p>
    
    Q: Have you heard Oasis' new album?</p><p>
    
    A: [coughing] Excuse me, sorry... they have a new album?</p><p>
    
    Q: Yes, <i>Heathen Chemistry</i>.  It came out last week.</p><p>
    
    A: Didn't they break up or something?  I thought I heard on
    VH1 or somewhere that the brothers weren't speaking to each
    other.</p><p>
    
    Q: No, the Gallaghers are still together.  They replaced the
    rest of the band, but they still lead, in their quarrelsome way.</p><p>
    
    A: Well, since I haven't heard the album, I can't really
    intelligently comment on it.</p><p>
    
    Q: Oh, but I have a copy right here.  I'll put it on.</p><p>
    
    A: Oh, gee... okay.</p><p>
    
    Q: [music starts] While we're listening, I'll quote
    some lyrics-- I'd like to hear how they fit in with
    your theory.  The lead single, ""The Hindu Times,""
    revolves around one of Oasis' favorite topics with the
    chorus, ""I get so high I just can't feel it.""  Songs
    like ""Little by Little"" show that the brothers are
    growing up, though, expressing thoughts like, ""We the
    people fight for our existence/ We don't claim to be
    perfect but we're free,"" and bemoaning that ""my God
    woke up on the wrong side of His bed.""  But the most
    frequently touched upon topic is that of the woman
    who done them wrong, such as the harpy in ""Force of
    Nature"" who is castigated for ""smoking all my stash/
    And burning all my cash.""</p><p>
    
    A: No, wait a second, you had to have made that last
    one up.</p><p>
    
    Q: Just listen [""Force of Nature"" plays in background]</p><p>
    
    A: My God.  It's the chorus, even!</p><p>
    
    Q: So, is it art?</p><p>
    
    A: Well, the... um... lyrics, as clunky as they are,
    still reflect a certain point of view.</p><p>
    
    Q: That of the hedonistic rock star, head full of
    cocaine, bemoaning his lifestyle of promiscuous sex
    and striving for an easy quasi-spirituality?</p><p>
    
    A: Yeah, sure.  It's still a point of view... I guess.
    But the lyrics are just one aspect of any musical piece.</p><p>
    
    Q: You're exactly right.  And I think <i>Heathen
    Chemistry</i>'s instrumental, ""A Quick Peep,"" is the
    purest example of Oasis' musicality.  Here, let me
    play it for you.</p><p>
    
    A: See, now you're putting me on.  I've heard that
    before, it's the Allman Brothers or Clapton or
    somebody.</p><p>
    
    Q: Nope, still Oasis.</p><p>
    
    A: Hmmm.  Well, at least they're not stealing tricks
    from the Beatles any more, right? [laughing]</p><p>
    
    Q: No, they still are. [plays ""Born on a Different
    Cloud""]</p><p>
    
    A: Wow.  Well, as I said before, originality isn't
    necessarily a prerequisite for artistic achievement.
    Many great artists have been deeply influenced by
    their forebears.</p><p>
    
    Q: So if, say, somebody Xeroxed the entirety of <i>Crime
    and Punishment</i>, changed the title to <i>Russian
    Psycho</i>, and released it to the public, that would
    be okay?</p><p>
    
    A: Um... well, that's an extreme example.</p><p>
    
    Q: Oh.  Well, it gets better.  Because <i>Heathen
    Chemistry</i> also takes the time to cop riffs and
    progressions from previous Oasis hits: ""Stop Crying
    Your Heart Out"" has the same string syrup as
    ""Wonderwall,"" ""Hung in a Bad Place"" recycles the noise
    and whine of pretty much every <i>Definitely Maybe</i>
    track, and so on.  So it's like our hypothetical artist
    repackaged the text of <i>Russian Psycho</i> as
    <i>Latvian Maniac</i> and passed it off as his newest
    work.  Still art?</p><p>
    
    A: Leave me alone.</p></div>"|5931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5931-heathen-chemistry/|1.2|Rob Mitchum

I don't want to brag, but it was pretty cool.  You
    probably have an image of us sitting around moaning all day or sipping tea with the Dalai Lama.  But
    this was a really cool monastery: we prayed hard, we played hard, and we studied the deadliest martial
    arts.  We'd go maybe four hours in morning meditation, two hours study, break to get a bagel, and then
    five hours of beating each other bloody.  Then we'd chant bird songs.</p><p>
    
    I can't really describe how much I learned in that time.  We lived the life of the spirit and the mind.
    But we had some worldly conveniences: we had a snack bar in the basement, and you could shave your head
    with an electric razor.  Movie types came through all the time-- heck, Jet Li wanted to make a film about
    us-- and we also had guest lecturers.</p><p>
    
    That's how I met composer, astrologist, and all around swell guy Simon Wickham-Smith.  We called him the
    Punk Monk.  He spent two years in a monastery, and he could actually speak Tibetan.  (I never learned the
    language.  It's like Icelandic-- everyone you want to talk to speaks English, so it never gets on your 'to
    do' list.)  We weren't expecting him: he just showed up one day, climbing up the side of our mountain with
    a didjeridoo and an iBook laptop computer strapped to his back.</p><p>
    
    ""I feel heartened by my climb,"" he greeted us.</p><p>
    
    ""Yeah, it's a real ab-slammer.  But next time try the ski lift.  It has a coffee bar!""</p><p>
    
    Wickham-Smith could be as serious as your ancestor's grave-- he'd hunch over that iBook for hours, composing
    long, intense pieces of music.  But when he wasn't working it was all play.  The guy liked his whiskey older
    than his women, and when it came to sex... well, you try catching some zzz's while someone's banging your
    roommate's head into a humble stone headboard all night.  No wonder I failed my triple-flip-kick-in-the-jaw
    test for my ""Flying Feet of the Gods"" class.</p><p>
    
    But as I was saying, Wickham-Smith was serious about music, and he was an enlightened man of faith.  He
    brought us an early release of his album <i>Extreme Bukake</i>, which he recorded on a laptop in Oxford,
    England.  'Bukake,' or 'bukkake,' means... well, you're online, you'll have more fun looking it up yourself.
    The three pieces on the disc, abstract, sometimes drone-like soundscapes that run from seven to forty minutes
    in length, were inspired by three stages of his religious life.  Wickham-Smith grew up Catholic, and then
    spent a couple years with the Hare Krishnas, before joining what we kiddingly call ""the winning team"":
    Tibetan Buddhism.</p><p>
    
    Each piece reflects one of these faiths.  He built the two-part ""Ave Regina Celorum"" around a Catholic hymn,
    sticking excerpts of choral singing on top of sustained synthesizer chords and jarring sound effects.  The
    track's second part has distorted wind sounds and intermittent clicking.  It sounds like he pitch-shifted
    one of the sopranos right through the steeple, and he distorts the vocals to make them sound near and then
    far, clear and distorted.  Wickham-Smith refuses to let the heavenly sounds soothe us: we glimpse the ""Ave
    Maria""/Gorecki's 3rd Symphony potential through the lo-fi rasp, but he won't give in to it.  Wickham-Smith
    suggested this would make good meditation music, but it lasted about five seconds with our group; if I'm not
    serene all morning I get a neck crick.</p><p>
    
    Another piece, ""Sri Guru Vandana,"" contains a... chant? from the Hare Krishna tradition.  It blasts out at
    full volume with the vocals turned into a scratchy, distorted mess; they're wrapped in glitches, hiss and
    other sonic barbed wire.  Between the vocals, Wickham-Smith inserts long notes like drones from a horn, with
    static and wind-like groans layered in.  This, one of the record's better tracks, combines the vulgarity
    of the album title with 'pure' spirituality.  But it's a brutal experience: Wickham-Smith claims the piece
    reflects the 'positive' side of his experience with the Krishnas, but if that's true, I don't want to know
    what the downside was.</p><p>
    
    The real winner here, though, is ""The Self-Immolation of Thich Quang Duc,"" a representation of the inner
    thoughts of a Vietnamese Buddhist monk.  Thich Quang Duc had himself set on fire in 1963 to protest his
    government.  I know what you're thinking, that the piece about the dead guy is always going to be the most
    impressive.  But this is also the shortest and most intense piece of music: it's just a glitchy beat that
    sounds like a heart, racing in anticipation of what's about to happen, with abstract swells representing
    street noises.</p><p>
    
    The day before Wickham-Smith packed up and left, I didn't have time to talk to him: that was the day of the
    big Monks/Ninjas game, and I'm the second-string quarterback.  I regretted that, because this album left me
    with a lot of questions.  The music itself is okay: aside from ""Thich Quang Doc,"" it could stand to be more
    compelling.  I think calling ""Ave Regina Celorum"" a 'meditation' piece is just a dodge around how slack it
    sounds at forty minutes.</p><p>
    
    But the ideas are fascinating.  Wickham-Smith takes spiritual content and ships it under the most corporeal
    title possible.  He sets themes about religious life in the real world-- the dedication of a spiritualist
    who kills himself for politics; the distortion of the abject beauty of religious music.  Nothing pure gets
    out of this album without some dirt on it.  And it's deep listening music that makes you think, instead of
    drift off-- way better than 'that hippie New Age shit' our guru's always ranting against.</p><p>
    
    I had a lot to talk about with Simon, but we never had a chance to discuss it.  When I got back from the game,
    he was drunker than the sixth Dalai Lama.  He had a nun under each arm and was yelling at everyone to get in
    the rec room: ""Last one in the hot tub gets bukkaked!""</p></div>"|8675.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8675-extreme-bukake/|7.2|Chris Dahlen

    classes you never thought you'd use?  Sure you do.  You used to sit behind
    that weird kid Jimmy, who always picked his nose and stuck the goobers to the
    bottom of his chair.  And for the life of you, you couldn't figure out when
    the hell you were ever going to utilize your extensive knowledge of quadratic
    equations.  But you sat through it all-- you learned the FOIL method and the
    difference between a sine and a cosine, and you were glad when it was all over
    and you'd never have to deal with complex math again.</p><p>
    
    Well, get ready for a time warp, because math is back, girlfriend.  And this
    time, it rocks.  On their debut album, Boston's Nationale Blue throw more
    numbers in your face than you could possibly comprehend without running for
    that graphing calculator you first mastered ""Tetris"" on all those years ago.
    Seems these boys are fickle fellas, rarely staying loyal to any one time
    signature for very long.</p><p>
    
    The trio wastes no time letting you know what's up, opening their debut with
    a skittering programmed beat and laying sounds on top of it like gathering
    clouds before letting loose in a torrent of pure rhythm.  The instrumental,
    ""Silver Alien Pyjamas in II Movements,"" bursts free with keyboard ostinatos
    and hovering, alien guitars, moving quickly onto charging guitar heroism before
    finally settling for a while on a more relaxed groove.   Taken for what it is,
    it's perfectly exhilarating, though my major complaint-- and this applies to
    several tracks on the album-- is that melody isn't a constant enough presence.
    Occasionally, the band will simply be jamming, with nothing to support, a fact
    that weakens the album somewhat.</p><p>
    
    Over half of <i>A Different Kind of Listening</i> is instrumental, and it's
    pretty easy to see why.  The band is highly skilled at hitting the listener
    with hairpin turns and laying down intriguing guitar textures, but their
    songwriting and vocal skills haven't quite caught up to their compositional
    mastery.  In much the same way that melody's absence can be felt during some
    stretches, a lot of the vocal parts feel underdeveloped and a little too
    amelodic, especially early in the disc.</p><p>
    
    To the band's credit, the album actually gathers strength as it wears on--
    the band seems to have saved some of the best parts for last.  For instance,
    ""Unraveling Secret Codes,"" an instrumental deconstruction of the vocal tune
    ""Secret Codes.""  The instrumental effectively takes the most basic musical
    elements of song and stretches them like rhythmic putty to their logical
    breaking point.  The shouted, punkish vocal parts also start to fit in
    better, as the band builds rhythmic environments for the verses that house
    them more appropriately.</p><p>
    
    ""Hearts and Knives"" manages a thrashing chorus with its repeated mantra of,
    ""In the river, you'll fall.""  It's one of the dirtiest tracks here, too,
    crying up from a blanket of distortion that the band is only too happy to
    fold up and stow away on most of the tracks.  This works to the band's
    advantage, as their intricately interlocking parts come through best when the
    guitars are clean and well defined. Instrumental ""Where the Hawks Fly"" creeps
    along on one of the band's most steadfast rhythms, as bassist Dave Altman and
    drummer Adam Kriney lock in with each other and guitarist Reuben Bettsak allows
    himself to wander a little more.  As much as their fast and furious rhythmic
    shifts and u-turns can be frequently engaging and interesting, it's nice to
    hear them stick around in regular old four for a while.</p><p>
    
    Of course, you can't get off the hook that easily.  There's plenty more
    complex math to be had on the galloping one-two combination of ""Made Up
    Meanings to Made Up Words"" and closer ""Your Head Is in the Dark, I Cannot
    Extract You.""  ""Your Head"" is one of the band's finest offerings, clanging
    along mightily on a thick bassline and charging drums outlined by rapidly
    strummed guitar.  After the last vocal section (you could hardly label things
    choruses and verses in this realm-- the songs have far too many sections and
    breakdowns), the band rolls up their sleeves to reveal some surprisingly
    thick biceps, pummeling one last time signature into the ground before
    careening to a tightly wound finish.</p><p>
    
    And there you have it.  By this point, your ass has been math-rocked six ways
    from Sunday, and you'll rarely hear it done with more conviction or facility.
    When they're not out graphing new directions for their music, the Nationale
    Blue like to smash their head pretty hard on the punk rock, too, and it shows
    in the energetic and convincing performances they put up.  As well as they
    present it, though, there's a certain emotional distance to the music that
    means it's definitely not going to be everyone's bag.  But the Nationale Blue
    do manage to pull off what none of my teachers ever managed to: they make
    math appealing, and I don't even have to sit behind Jimmy to enjoy it.</p></div>"|5725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5725-a-different-kind-of-listening/|7.8|Joe Tangari

    the primary creative force behind two of the most admired indie rock albums ever, Jeff Mangum's decision to
    put his work with Neutral Milk Hotel on the backburner (some suspect permanently) came as a surprise to
    music fans everywhere. Even more shocking to many was what followed: a trip to Europe and the announcement
    of a new project. Titled <i>Orange Twin Field Works, Volume One</i>, Mangum's newest work has none of the
    precisely layered instrumentation or eminently empathetic lyricism of Mangum's earlier work. In fact,
    Mangum's distinctive, shaky voice is nowhere to be found.  That's right, <i>Orange Twin Field Works</i> is
    just what it claims to be: a collection of field recordings made by Mangum during his travels of Europe.</p><p>
    
    And this may be surprising to some. But it shouldn't be. While Mangum's fellow Elephant 6 chums were busy
    taking inspiration from the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Zombies and their ilk, Mangum was peppering his
    work with bagpipes, tape loops, singing saws, and a whole slew of other instruments and sounds too bizarre
    too identify-- yet he always made them easy to identify <i>with</i>.  When one takes into account both Mangum's
    ability to present atypical musical ideas to typical American audiences, and his seeming desire to push the
    limits of his form, the contents of <i>Orange Twin Field Works</i> make perfect sense.</p><p>
    
    The music of Bulgaria is actually the amalgamation of the native music of a handful of tribes that first
    settled the land in the seventh century. By traditional Western Music standards, it has an incredibly unique
    sound.  It's performed largely with strings, wind instruments and vocals; made up of asymmetrical structures,
    dueling vocal parts, and time signatures some of us would call awkward even after spending the better part
    of the 90s marinating in math-rock.  For hundreds of years, this strange music has evolved, all the while
    playing an almost crucial part in the lives of many Bulgarians; it accompanies everything from work to dining
    to relaxation. The annual festival which Mangum documents here lasts three days and nights, generally draws
    over 20,000 singers, dancers and players, and over 200,000 captive witnesses to the town of Koprivshtitsa.</p><p>
    
    Mangum does more here than just present the music at hand. Given the important role it played in the
    development of modern Western Music (Bulgaria was playing around with stuff like 5/16 time signatures
    centuries before most notable European Composers ever walked the earth), compilations of Bulgarian music
    are fairly easy to come by. So rather than rehash the same ol' same ol', Mangum makes a point of assembling
    these sounds in such a way that it might make sense to typical American ears. These recordings are presented
    as one long track, with songs blending not only into one another, but also into sounds of traffic, the
    conversation of onlookers, the whooshing of the wind. Clearly, Mangum wants his listeners to feel as though
    they're experiencing something as magical as what he experienced, and not just listening to 'another CD.'</p><p>
<i>Orange Twin Field Works</i> couldn't sound less like Neutral Milk Hotel if it tried, but much of it is
    curiously on par with some of Mangum's best work, despite that the only instrument he plays here is the
    record button.  When you listen, keep in mind that there's a reason Mangum was driven to the Balkan Peninsula
    by this stuff. There's something in this music that mattered to him, some quality so distinct he felt it must
    be captured and exposed to a culture that would otherwise have no access to it.  Some of the best music
    produced by the Western world-- from Louis Armstrong's ""St. Louis Blues"" to even Neutral Milk Hotel's ""Ghost""--
    stems not only from the musicians letting go and having fun, but from the musicians openly communicating that
    joy to the listener.  And the people making the music on <i>Orange Twin Field Works</i> are obviously having
    a blast.</p><p>
    
    Mangum may never make another Neutral Milk Hotel record, and instead dedicate himself to field recordings
    (he's considering traveling to Romania for <i>Orange Twin, Volume 2</i>), playing back-up in his friends'
    bands, and working on John Oswald-style sound collages that no one but his close friends may ever get to
    hear (check the Pitchfork interview and marvel at the very idea). But perhaps that's what he needs to do,
    for himself.  And this is why Mangum is a consummate artist.  He realizing that producing the material others
    want and expect from him isn't always what's best for him. Sometimes the most important thing an artist can
    do-- both for himself and for his work-- is to halt everything and take a chance, to step back, to observe,
    and to learn.  Perhaps we would be wise as listeners to step back and learn with him.</p></div>"|5069.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5069-orange-twin-field-works-vol-1/|8.5|David M. Pecoraro

Why do we need to replace our old copies?  Because the label screwed up the     first time!  They half-assed the original release and they expect us to buy it again now that they've fixed     it up.</p>
<p>Until now, I was happy with my XTC CDs.  The liner notes were skimpy, but the discs sounded fine, and most     of them came with bonus tracks.  Now Virgin is reissuing the whole batch again, from 1978's <i>White Music</i> to 1992's <i>Nonsuch</i>, the band's last album with the label.  For a test, I picked up the new edition of     <i>English Settlement</i> and compared it to my twelve year-old CD-- which, by the way, has no scratches or     flaws, and the ink, contrary to legend, hasn't eaten through the plastic and corroded the disc.  There is no     reason to replace it.</p>
<p>Except that the new one actually sounds better.  Comparing it on a good stereo, it's obvious that the sound     is bigger and crisper, and the instruments are more clearly differentiated.  Check out ""Yacht Dance"": it's     like somebody wiped off a layer of grime.  And now that I've listened to this, even my old copy of <i>Drums     and Wires</i> sounds muddy.  Bastards.</p>
<p>These reissues are now trickling into the States, and <i>Go 2</i>, <i>Black Sea</i>, and <i>English     Settlement</i>-- their second, fourth and fifth records, respectively-- came at the end of last month.     Each disc gets 24-bit remastered sound and a better booklet.  They include the same bonus tracks as the     original CD releases: <i>Black Sea</i> has three extra cuts, <i>Go 2</i> includes the single ""Are You     Receiving Me?,"" and <i>English Settlement</i>, a double-album, is packed by itself onto a single disc.     The only difference is that this time, the bonus tracks are at the end instead of the middle.  That     preserves the flow, but it also assumes you're ready to listen to any more music after, say, <i>Black     Sea</i>'s ""Travels in Nihilon"" or <i>Drums and Wires</i>' ""Complicated Game.""  Those closers were so right     for those albums that I'd rather have an intermission than an encore.</p>
<p>Let's say that you've led an XTC-free life and you've never heard these albums.  These three take us from     the band's first struggling line-up to (arguably) their best album, <i>English Settlement</i>, which is also     (<i>in</i>arguably) one of the best albums of the 1980s.  But when they recorded <i>Go 2</i>, the band had     just begun to garner attention.  Their Buddy Holly-on-amphetamines sound merged with punk to make music that     was noisy and jittery, danceable enough for the crowds at the clubs, and suspiciously poppy thanks to the     catchy hooks and their trademark verse-chorus-verse-chorus-<i>explode</i> pattern.</p>
<p><i>Go 2</i> captures the moment, but it was rushed out too quickly.  In fact, it could be the worst album     they've ever made.  The songs are even weaker than the ones on their debut, <i>White Music</i>.  You have     to like the infectious tune and whoomping rhythm section on guitarist Andy Partridge's ""Meccanik Dancing     (Oh We Go!),"" or bassist Colin Moulding's rocker ""Crowded Room.""  But even the good songs get weak     performances, as the band has trouble staying 'on message': ""Battery Brides,"" Partridge's nod to Brian Eno,     sounds lackluster, while other songs sound too spastic.  Partridge is still working out the kinks here as a     singer, and his guitar would become more focused after Dave Gregory joined as the second axe.</p>
<p>But the album's biggest weakness, and the line-up's worst misfit, is Barry Andrews, who plays the hockey     rink-style organ.  The instrument is great in small doses (the buzzing on ""Life Is Good in the Greenhouse,""     for example), but after hearing it needle and pierce every song on this album, I'm ready to smash it, shred     the blueprints and burn down the factory.  And Andrews himself is no prize.  He writes one track and co-writes     another, and they're the worst songs the band ever played: one is a fake reggae called ""Super-Tuff,"" and the     other goes, ""I don't know what she done wrong but I want to hurt her/ Take it out on her/ With my weapon.""     A lot of us can take misogyny in valid artistic contexts, but this guy's as dim as a sack of rocks.</p>
<p>Andrews left the band after <i>Go 2</i>, and Dave Gregory joined to play guitar and keyboards.  With Terry     Chambers remaining on drums, this is the line-up that finally clicks.  My friends and I argue about which is     the better classic: 1979's <i>Drums and Wires</i> or 1980's <i>Black Sea</i>.  On the former they nailed the     visceral sound described by the title-- the jagged, jittery guitars and earth-thudding drums.  Songs like     ""Helicopter"" and ""Scissorman"" owed a lot not just to the hooks and tunes, but to the impact of Gregory and     Partridge shredding fingers on strings, and Chambers and Moulding's loose-necked rhythm section.  On <i>Black     Sea</i>, however, they act more like a pop group.  The guitars are less nervous, and the songs-- sharper and     catchier than ever before-- get more room to breathe: ""Generals and Majors"" sounds jumpy but the guitars play     melodies instead of textures. ""Respectable Street"" and ""Burning with Optimism's Flames"" slow down enough to     let the riffs sink in, and ""Towers of London"" paints tall images with its stone-laying guitar lines.     Partridge also finally shows his talent as an expressive pop singer, stretching and mauling the words of     ""No Language in Our Lungs.""</p>
<p><i>Black Sea</i> has tunes like ""Sgt. Rock"" that-- as much as Partridge has disowned the lyrics-- will never     vacate your brain. (Sing it with me: ""If I could only be tough like him..."")  But ""Rocket in a Bottle"" is one     of their most jet-fueled songs, and ""Travels in Nihilon"" is one of their strangest, with the arena-sized     drums, Komodo dragon-like bass, and guitars that sound like flaming stacks of wood.  Partridge deserves     credit here for experimenting with avant-pop yet never ignoring or undermining the song.  (He left the really     indulgent stuff for his solo albums.)</p>
<p>Two years later, XTC released <i>English Settlement</i>.  I can complain about Virgin's rerelease policy as     much as I want, but the nice thing about buying this is that I revisited an album that's been in my life for     years.  I first listened to this with my high school sweetheart, and I'm playing it now a week before I get     married.  I'm far from the first person to say that it ages well-- in fact, it sounds just as fresh now as     it ever did, and there are some songs like ""All of a Sudden (It's Too Late)"" that I didn't even like until I     was in my mid-twenties.</p>
<p><i>English Settlement</i> marks the change from the jumpy live band that preceded it to the assured studio     band that came after.  It's all drums and wires-- with some bird-like sax honks that suit the vaguely African     expanse of the sound-- but they're slowed and simplified into the two components that, to crib an image from     David Toop, most resemble the human body: the nervous music of the head, and the deep, heavy music of the     heart.  The skittering guitars on ""English Roundabout"" would have fit in their earlier work, but this time     they're acoustic and softer.  And the songs run longer: the killer beat at the end of ""Melt the Guns"" takes     all the time it needs to play itself out, and ""All of a Sudden"" lets Partridge wring every nuance from what     could be the best lyrics he's ever written, making broad statements about life and love through simple,     sharp imagery.  It's the only song on the album that's not about something specific: it could be a breakup     song, but it turns into a lament from a young man who's just realizing that he has years of sad aggravation     ahead of him.</p>
<p>From the first song, the album sounds more serious and self-assured than anything they'd yet recorded.     Moulding's chase theme, ""Runaways,"" opens the album with an urgency that's almost disturbing until it fades     to the street anthem of ""Ball and Chain.""  I came this close to writing that Partridge's ""Senses Working     Overtime"" was ""a cornerstone of modern civilization.""  And how about ""Snowman,"" with the bitter lyrics that     are totally overturned by the tooth-rottingly sweet melody?  ""Jason and the Argonauts"" feels simultaneously     like sailing the high seas and getting thrown in a trash can and rolled down a hill.  And as for the drumming     and percussion, it's clear that though XTC is underrated, Terry Chambers was even more ignored: on every song     here his playing is impeccable.</p>
<p>But what gets me most about hearing this album is the way it captures their 'earnest young men' phase.  It's     that transitory time in their mid-to-late twenties when they could make political statements with easy     conviction (""melt the guns,"" ""knuckle down, love his race,"" ""science once again robs us of our jobs"") or     toss off songs as beautiful as ""Yacht Dance"" without overworking or overthinking them.  This is earnestness     that doesn't make excuses for itself, doesn't fret over bold statements, and doesn't even seem aware of how     clearly and confidently it's proceeding.  <i>English Settlement</i> catches that moment, as they change from     a young band to a mature one: this is the pivot on which their entire career hangs, and a vantage point from     which both ends of it make sense.  It's timeless.</p></div>"|8833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8833-go-2-black-sea-english-settlement/|6.9|Chris Dahlen

He writes one track and co-writes     another, and they're the worst songs the band ever played: one is a fake reggae called ""Super-Tuff,"" and the     other goes, ""I don't know what she done wrong but I want to hurt her/ Take it out on her/ With my weapon.""     A lot of us can take misogyny in valid artistic contexts, but this guy's as dim as a sack of rocks.</p>
<p>Andrews left the band after <i>Go 2</i>, and Dave Gregory joined to play guitar and keyboards.  With Terry     Chambers remaining on drums, this is the line-up that finally clicks.  My friends and I argue about which is     the better classic: 1979's <i>Drums and Wires</i> or 1980's <i>Black Sea</i>.  On the former they nailed the     visceral sound described by the title-- the jagged, jittery guitars and earth-thudding drums.  Songs like     ""Helicopter"" and ""Scissorman"" owed a lot not just to the hooks and tunes, but to the impact of Gregory and     Partridge shredding fingers on strings, and Chambers and Moulding's loose-necked rhythm section.  On <i>Black     Sea</i>, however, they act more like a pop group.  The guitars are less nervous, and the songs-- sharper and     catchier than ever before-- get more room to breathe: ""Generals and Majors"" sounds jumpy but the guitars play     melodies instead of textures. ""Respectable Street"" and ""Burning with Optimism's Flames"" slow down enough to     let the riffs sink in, and ""Towers of London"" paints tall images with its stone-laying guitar lines.     Partridge also finally shows his talent as an expressive pop singer, stretching and mauling the words of     ""No Language in Our Lungs.""</p>
<p><i>Black Sea</i> has tunes like ""Sgt. Rock"" that-- as much as Partridge has disowned the lyrics-- will never     vacate your brain. (Sing it with me: ""If I could only be tough like him..."")  But ""Rocket in a Bottle"" is one     of their most jet-fueled songs, and ""Travels in Nihilon"" is one of their strangest, with the arena-sized     drums, Komodo dragon-like bass, and guitars that sound like flaming stacks of wood.  Partridge deserves     credit here for experimenting with avant-pop yet never ignoring or undermining the song.  (He left the really     indulgent stuff for his solo albums.)</p>
<p>Two years later, XTC released <i>English Settlement</i>.  I can complain about Virgin's rerelease policy as     much as I want, but the nice thing about buying this is that I revisited an album that's been in my life for     years.  I first listened to this with my high school sweetheart, and I'm playing it now a week before I get     married.  I'm far from the first person to say that it ages well-- in fact, it sounds just as fresh now as     it ever did, and there are some songs like ""All of a Sudden (It's Too Late)"" that I didn't even like until I     was in my mid-twenties.</p>
<p><i>English Settlement</i> marks the change from the jumpy live band that preceded it to the assured studio     band that came after.  It's all drums and wires-- with some bird-like sax honks that suit the vaguely African     expanse of the sound-- but they're slowed and simplified into the two components that, to crib an image from     David Toop, most resemble the human body: the nervous music of the head, and the deep, heavy music of the     heart.  The skittering guitars on ""English Roundabout"" would have fit in their earlier work, but this time     they're acoustic and softer.  And the songs run longer: the killer beat at the end of ""Melt the Guns"" takes     all the time it needs to play itself out, and ""All of a Sudden"" lets Partridge wring every nuance from what     could be the best lyrics he's ever written, making broad statements about life and love through simple,     sharp imagery.  It's the only song on the album that's not about something specific: it could be a breakup     song, but it turns into a lament from a young man who's just realizing that he has years of sad aggravation     ahead of him.</p>
<p>From the first song, the album sounds more serious and self-assured than anything they'd yet recorded.     Moulding's chase theme, ""Runaways,"" opens the album with an urgency that's almost disturbing until it fades     to the street anthem of ""Ball and Chain.""  I came this close to writing that Partridge's ""Senses Working     Overtime"" was ""a cornerstone of modern civilization.""  And how about ""Snowman,"" with the bitter lyrics that     are totally overturned by the tooth-rottingly sweet melody?  ""Jason and the Argonauts"" feels simultaneously     like sailing the high seas and getting thrown in a trash can and rolled down a hill.  And as for the drumming     and percussion, it's clear that though XTC is underrated, Terry Chambers was even more ignored: on every song     here his playing is impeccable.</p>
<p>But what gets me most about hearing this album is the way it captures their 'earnest young men' phase.  It's     that transitory time in their mid-to-late twenties when they could make political statements with easy     conviction (""melt the guns,"" ""knuckle down, love his race,"" ""science once again robs us of our jobs"") or     toss off songs as beautiful as ""Yacht Dance"" without overworking or overthinking them.  This is earnestness     that doesn't make excuses for itself, doesn't fret over bold statements, and doesn't even seem aware of how     clearly and confidently it's proceeding.  <i>English Settlement</i> catches that moment, as they change from     a young band to a mature one: this is the pivot on which their entire career hangs, and a vantage point from     which both ends of it make sense.  It's timeless.</p></div>"|8833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8833-go-2-black-sea-english-settlement/|10.0|Chris Dahlen

    maestro Otis Jackson Jr. (aka Madlib) hunches over an old and battered SP 1200, relentlessly coping samples
    and building tracks so rich and smooth that they can only be called musical butter.  He rarely sleeps, and
    some days he never even leaves his lab, preferring to spend in excess of 15 hours honing his craft. There
    are over a dozen completed albums in the can (including two additional Quas albums and 12 from his jazz
    group Yesterday's New Quintet), as well as numerous beat albums and mix tapes that are recorded on a daily
    basis. But, like an imprisoned Genet scribbling Our Lady of the Flowers on toilet tissue, Madlib doesn't
    hold any illusions that a large majority of his material will ever be released-- due to both their sheer
    quantity and sample-clearance issues (fuck intellectual property!).  But when the muse calls-- and apparently
    she's got the man on speed-dial-- Madlib never hesitates to light a splif and start diggin'.</p><p>
    
    Madlib's latest, the vinyl-only EP <i>Astronaut</i>, was recorded in the same time period as <i>The Unseen</i>,
    the '00 classic that introduced us to Madlib's bugged out alter-ego Quasimoto. While the album is technically
    a Quasimoto release, there's only one song on the three-song EP where Madlib affects the classic, helium-tinted
    Quas voice.  But don't despair, the Quas vibe permeates the album, and the songs on this one are as good as
    anything on <i>The Unseen</i>.</p><p>
    
    After a short jazz interlude, the album kicks off proper with the gleefully blunted title track.  ""You ain't
    no astronaut,"" a sample voice declares, quickly followed by Quasimoto's retort: ""but we've been out here in
    orbit, walked further than the moon, ain't we.""  A string and horn based sample, which is both psychedelic
    and sad, anchors the song and perfectly compliments Quasimoto's nearly nonsensical lyrics.  In addition to
    the music, Madlib liberally sprinkles a spoken word sample that functions as yet another narrative voice.
    This is a device Madlib often employs, and it further decenters the track as it adds a 70s blaxploitation
    vibe central to the Quas persona.</p><p>
    
    Although the song ""Astronaut"" is a nice addition to Quas' catalog, the real gem here is the second track,
    ""Am I Confused?""  The title's rhetorical question, which is repeated in the chorus, reflects the artist's
    inner-turmoil as he deals with issues of self-destruction, loss, and community.  Thematically speaking,
    this is one of his most self-reflective, complex and rewarding songs to date.  Recalling Marvin Gaye's
    classic ""What's Going On,"" the song addresses Madlib's feelings of confusion and helplessness as he
    witnesses the deterioration of his friends and family members.  But whereas ""What's Going On"" took a more
    reductionary, macrocosmic view, ""Am I Confused?"" suggests the ills that infect its inhabitants are a result
    of their own deeply embedded self-destructive urges.  The song is populated with adulterous fathers and
    cancerous break-dancers, an AIDS-stricken sister and inner-city derelicts ""drinkin' nightrain and pumpin'
    needles in their vein.""  Throughout the song, Madlib constantly modulates his voice so that it appears there
    are numerous emcees on the track.  This is a nice touch in that it lifts the veil of anonymity and breaches
    the gap between the two personas of Madlib and Quasimoto, suggesting that the tragedies described are
    something both sides of Otis Jackson can agree upon.  The song's production is anchored by a xylophone
    sample that's a melancholy, downbeat slice of classic 70s soul-- in other words, vintage Madlib.</p><p>
<i>Astronaut</i>'s import- and vinyl-only status may make it difficult for the average American consumer to
    access, but the songs on this record are just too precious to be trusted to anything other than vinyl.  The
    only complaint I had-- and the only reason that I didn't give this a higher rating-- is that the label left
    one whole side of the record blank, not bothering to press the instrumentals, a rarity for the DJ-friendly
    Madlib.  But that somewhat petty and selfish complaint aside, this is one record every Quasimoto fan is gonna
    need to cop.</p></div>"|6611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6611-astronaut-ep/|8.7|Sam Chennault

    in the East Village, or a Costco outlet opening in Yuma, Arizona-- I'm often asked the same question by some
    concerned audience member.  ""Rob,"" they ask, ""as a world-renowned Internet music critic, can you please
    explain to me what 'IDM' is?""  Chuckling to myself and stroking my salt-and-pepper beard, I reply, ""First of
    all, as a little joke, I like to say that the 'I' in 'IDM' stands for unlistenable.  Ahahahaha.  Ha.""  The
    laughter and applause is usually deafening, save the few pale kids in the back wearing <i>Geogaddi</i> shirts
    who choose to scoff and shoot dirty glances rather than salute my delightful witticism.</p><p>
    
    Ahh, but I kid, <i>Grooves</i> subscribers; I kid because I love.  It's just hard not to mock a genre whose
    very name reminds people that the music within is 'intelligent,' lest any of us confuse it with the low-brow
    disrobing anthems of Nelly and Tweet.  Also amusing is the D-for-Dance part, since a lot of the music in
    this pigeonhole seems to require a minimum of six legs and a mild case of epilepsy to actually dance along.
    Yeah, so IDM is a label dreamt up by critics stretching for words to describe bleeps and bloops, though the
    Very Serious attitude of a lot of artists in the IDM neighborhood does little to wash away the stink of
    elitism.</p><p>
    
    Of course, even I recognize that there are exceptions to this snooty caricature, and it's these exceptions
    that usually pace the field in terms of exposure and influence.  The 'It' Boy of the IDM beauty pageant at
    this very second is Mr. Scott Herren of Atlanta, Georgia, for whom Prefuse 73 is the best known of a Stephen
    Merritt-like stable of aliases.  Herren's turned a number of ears lately by setting up camp at the crossroads
    of the two most fertile sounds going right now-- your hip-hop and your electronic-- and catering to the
    forward-thinkers of both crowds.  Herren even threw out a little bait named Sam Prekop on his last LP to
    get the indie rockers' attention, proving that the underground also knows how to sell a few more records
    with the ""Ft."" credit.</p><p>
    
    But being king of the hill in either electronic or hip-hop is generally a short-lived affair, and flirting
    with both scenes simultaneously makes Prefuse 73 an extra-juicy target for a coup d'etat.  Hence his new
    EP, <i>The '92 vs. '02 Collection</i>, is receiving more scrutiny than an Arab-American at an airport
    security checkpoint, the rabble itching to throw Herren on the washed-up pile with Richard D. James and Dan
    Nakamura.  Thing is, Herren's not going down easy.  This EP's neither a retread of <i>Vocal Studies + Uprock
    Narratives</i>' inventions, nor a needlessly abrupt U-turn away from that album.</p><p>
    
    Though they're subtle, there are definite changes afoot.  Most noticeably, someone seems to have scared
    the hiccups out of Herren's music; after <i>Vocal Studies</i> moved the word 'glitch' from troubleshooting
    manuals to hipster dictionaries, he seems to be letting the style go its own way.  And save a short
    chest-beating sample in the prologue to ""When Irony Wears Thin"" (""you want my style so much"") and a diva
    given the blender treatment on ""Love You Bring,"" Herren leaves behind the nothing-but-vowels linguistic
    deconstruction of his previous outing.  Filling in the empty spaces instead is a busier, more jittery
    undercurrent, full of taps, snaps, and claps, clicks, flicks, and thwicks.</p><p>
    
    What's thankfully left intact is Herren's ability to present his art in digestible three-to-five-minute
    portions, or 'songs,' if you will.  As with the similarly deified DJ Shadow, writers confronted with
    Prefuse 73 music tend to get so tied up with describing the artist's technical accomplishments and cultural
    relevancy that they forget that both men possess the remarkable ability to make innovation fun.  There's a
    reason <i>Vocal Studies</i> turns up in more CD towers than Autechre; like a novel or a movie with both
    literal and allegorical meanings, Prefuse can be enjoyed on either a visceral or intellectual level.</p><p>
    
    And if you haven't already figured it out, I'd rather listen to <i>The '92 vs. '02 Collection</i> as a record
    than as a thesis.  Forget musical evolution, I like ""Desks, Pencils, Bottles"" because the central sample of
    clanking glass bottles sounds really fucking neat alongside the window-rattling bass and astral synthesizers.
    ""When Irony Wears Thin"" is good, too; with brassy orchestration like a cop-show theme song coasting over a
    skyline of beeps and tests of the emergency broadcast system.  ""It Never Entered"" and ""Love you Bring"" are
    slightly less ear-catching; the first concentrates on the same synthesizers (the '02, I assume) against
    handclaps (the '92?) battle as the rest of the EP, and the second comes closest to a <i>Vocal Studies</i>
    leftover with its R&amp;B; vocals and looped acoustic guitar snippet.</p><p>
    
    That's an EP for you, though-- a low-profile snack between meals to tweak one's sound and hint at future
    directions.  As a strategic move, releasing <i>The '92 vs. '02 Collection</i> is probably good policy, as
    it'll hopefully deflect some of the required backlash when the true follow-up to <i>Vocal Studies</i> is
    released (something, ahem, the Shadow knows about).  For the rest of us, <i>'92 vs. '02</i> is an
    entertaining fifteen minutes, thanks to Herren balancing out the I with enough D, and making pretty darn
    good M.</p></div>"|6451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6451-the-92-vs-02-collection-ep/|7.7|Rob Mitchum

    are.  Aside from basically being a poster event for the RIAA and its associated
    labels to puff up their big, fat egos, the awards are invalidated for me simply
    by the fact that they ignore nearly every album released in a given year-- i.e.
    those released on independent labels.  Figure in the ridiculously over-the-top
    musical performances (Britney Spears dancing with a robot army, anyone?) and
    you've got yourself a pretty sorry event, punctuated only by the occasional
    bright spot, like those kids a couple years back who could play jazz really,
    really well.</p><p>
    
    But the talent involved doesn't really matter when you consider the exclusive
    nature of the award.  In my readings over the years, I've come across a lot
    of little interesting facts about the Grammys, but the ones that always get me
    are the curveballs the industry occasionally throws.  And I can't recall a
    bigger curveball than the nomination of Skeleton Key's 1997 Capitol Records
    debut, <i>Fantastic Spikes Through Balloon</i>.</p><p>
    
    Clarification is in order: Skeleton Key were actually nominated in the best
    artwork category, and they deserved it.  The artwork for that record, with
    its punch card display of band photos and ephemera, is unique and very well
    executed.  But still, for an album like <i>Fantastic Spikes</i> to even be
    mentioned at a ceremony like that was odd.  You know the drill for bands like
    Skeleton Key: release a great debut EP on a tiny indie, get 'discovered' by
    major label A&amp;R;, record an equally excellent debut album, receive no promotional
    push, then politely fall by the wayside.</p><p>
    
    It's hard to believe it's been five years since Skeleton Key first fell through
    the cracks. The band initially burned out after two years of touring, trading
    percussionist Steve Calhoon and multi-instrumentalist Rick Lee to upstart Enon
    and sinking into dormancy.  Calhoon has since departed the fold entirely, but
    Lee is maintaining dual citizenship in both bands, and thankfully, he's brought
    back to Skeleton Key his distinctive found-object percussive assault.
    Singer/bassist Eric Sanko and guitarist Chris Maxwell are still around, and
    Calhoon has been replaced by skinsman Colin Brooks.  And to cap off their
    return, the band has moved to Mike Patton's Ipecac label, thus removing
    themselves from the Grammy equation entirely.  All the better, then.</p><p>
    
    The result of all this recalibrating and time off isn't exactly a work of
    undisputed genius, but it's a better return than could be expected from a
    band everyone thought long dead up until now.  <i>Obtainium</i>'s primary
    flaw is that it lacks some of the persuasive energy that shoved <i>Fantastic
    Spikes</i> straight down your throat.  The visceral power of a song like
    ""Watch the Fat Man Swing"" or ""Vomit Ascot"" is just nowhere to be found here,
    which could likely be blamed on the somewhat flat production work of a
    mysterious entity called the Dubious Brothers.</p><p>
    
    As for the band, they do what they can in their over-quantized environment,
    and the results are generally good, from the swaying junk funk of opener
    ""Sawdust"" to the Tom Waits-ish broken carnival ride of ""Roost in Peace.""  The
    quartet seems to be making a conscious attempt to vary their sound, resulting
    in an eclectic yet oddly (and again due to the production) monochromatic album.</p><p>
    
    ""Sawdust"" leads the pack, stringing an intermittent bassline out on a wire of
    funky guitar, cutting the whole mix through with divebombing synth noises.
    Sanko does his best not to sound like J Robbins, but the vocal similarity can
    be uncanny sometimes.  ""One Way, My Way"" is one of a few songs that feels a
    little constrained by rhyme scheme, with lines like, ""One way/ My way/ What I
    Say goes/ My opinion is fact/ And if you react/ Then it's gonna' come to
    blows.""  The song grooves so idiosyncratically around it, though, that such
    minor complaints fade easily from the mind.</p><p>
    
    The addition of several slower songs to the fray feels like a genuine step
    forward for the band, as they have a facility for brooding, molasses tunes
    like ""Candy,"" which manages to be both slow and jittery.  Noises squirm at
    all levels of the mix, while deliberate, steady guitar and bass parts drone
    on.  Meanwhile, when the drums enter, they're placed in such a way that it
    feels like everything else is supporting <i>them</i>, when the opposite is
    actually true.  Lee has clearly brought back a few tricks from the Enon bag,
    and he uses them to great effect.</p><p>
    
    The album closes with ""Say Goodnight,"" an understated lullaby haunted by a
    rusty music box and what could be electric cello or bowed bass that sounds
    like a song crumpled to the ground from exhaustion.  It's the perfect
    antecedent to careening rockers like ""King Know It All"" and ""Panic Bullets,""
    and also a perfect ending for the album, as it's one of the few moments that
    doesn't feel just a little stifled by the production.  If they can mange to
    maintain focus and release another album soon, it's my hope that Skeleton Key
    will work to harness the dementia and rawness so inherent in their sound and
    really run with it.  For now, <i>Obtainium</i> is a certainly an ample offering,
    if a little too tame.</p></div>"|7220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7220-obtainium/|7.3|Joe Tangari

Something about tides of
    distortion and steady chord progressions suggest an endless continuum, no real starting
    or stopping points.  You can imagine each layer of guitar still echoing somewhere out in
    the cosmos.  Despite their short-lived, tumultuous history, Slowdive were masters of the
    art, resting at an apex of pop songcraft in contrast to My Bloody Valentine's noisy
    psychedelia.  Slowdive mainstay Christian Savill is now making music with fellow Brit
    Sean Hewson as Monster Movie.  A bit of a misnomer, the band's combination of pedal-drenched
    atmosphere with soft melodies has led to a super-satisfying, solid full-length.</p><p>
    Coming at the heels of an earlier EP on Clairecords, <i>Last Night Something Happened</i>
    may be a bit more subdued than other offerings from the genre, but no less affecting.  The
    album begins with an instrumental, ""First Trip to the City,"" a nice nostalgic drift through
    gentle pedal fuzz and layered keyboards.  Then ""Shortwave"" continues with introspective piano,
    building into a poignant little chorus as the falsetto asks, ""How do you feel, when your days
    are behind you?""  Monster Movie have a way of multi-tracking their harmonies so thickly that
    it all blends with the instruments into an irresistible surge of sound.  ""Home"" adds backing
    vocals from Louise Hewson, whose lovely sigh gets caught up in blustery synth swirls and the
    crisp drum crack that punctuates the mix.</p><p>
    Like most dream-pop records, <i>Last Night Something Happened</i> is oriented towards album
    listening.  Just when you think the whole disc is about to be filled with gloomy mid-tempo
    romanticism, ""Waiting"" charms you with sunny guitar strumming and sing-song vocals.  ""Sleeping
    on a Train"" begins with a chugging locomotive riff, and takes the pace up a notch with an
    electrified jangle almost reminiscent of the Verve.  Monster Movie flirt somewhere at the
    edges of Britpop, but the mellow nature of the softer songs here suggests Liverpool as much
    as Manchester.  A brief change of pace arrives with ""Star City,"" a forlorn piano instrumental
    with whupping helicopter noises and television chatter in the background.</p><p>
    After the interlude, the album rises to another peak.  ""4th and Pine"" tells the story of a
    supposed suicide, though details are not revealed.  She's left behind only a note about her
    disappearance, sung with heartfelt sincerity by the boys: ""Shadow, shadow, that's all I seem
    to be/ I am a shadow of who I used to be.""  On paper it may sound cut from the rather cliché
    cloth of urban alienation, but the way that chorus wells up so hopefully and yet ends
    unresolved turns this into a moving sketch.  These songs may be about the unavoidable sorrows
    of life, but they're delivered with such compassion that the record takes on a medicinal
    quality.</p><p>
    The slow, uncurling bassline of ""Winter Is Coming"" signals the end of the album, and the
    aforementioned fade-out lasts measure after measure, easing you off.  Monster Movie may not
    be blessed with the absolutely ecstatic summery pulse of Slowdive, but it's clear they're
    aiming at a different season anyway.  Like many songwriting duos, Savill and Hewson know when
    to cut a good thing short, and you're left wanting more than thirty-seven minutes.  <i>Last
    Night Something Happened</i> ends at just the right moment, though, and there are few records
    I can recommend more this year in terms of pure pop replayability.  The sleeve photos, all
    cut from glossy Thingmakers cardstock, show rainy highways from the first-person perspective,
    all running beyond the horizon line.  It's clear that the album's meant to be a traveler's

    products, and told consumers all sorts of crazy crap like what the thing did
    and how much it cost.  Somewhere along the line, though, advertisers wised up
    and realized that consumers didn't care that their Ford Gas Crisis got just
    under a mile to the gallon as long as they thought they looked cool behind the
    wheel of sixty-five tons of American Pride.  Now we market image, and things
    like quality and efficiency have fallen to the wayside.  Fortunately for Dirty
    Vegas, they got in on all this when the getting was good (a 2003 Mitsubishi
    Eclipse won't even start unless you've got ""Days Go By"" blaring from the sound
    system and some Girl in a Hat seizing in the passenger seat), because in any
    other sort of climate, they'd be completely unknown, and rightly so.</p><p>
    
    Dirty Vegas' self-titled release is the stuff Top 40 charts are made of, yet
    it's been getting lots of play on the college stations in recent days.  And
    as you know, it's the Pitchforkian duty to set these studious DJs straight.
    Now, for what it's worth, <i>Dirty Vegas</i> won't rob you of the gift of sight
    or make your ears bleed; it's just boring.  At no point on this album does the
    'band' even approach the production of anything remotely like a fresh spin on
    the dance/electropop sound they've co-opted.  Instead, they try desperately to
    coast on the strength of a single (and one that's pretty shoddy in its own right,
    I might add) recycled over and over again in the most predictable and derivative
    of fashions.  The resulting sonic territory is standard electro-acoustic fare--
    nothing but homogenous dancefloor bass and acoustic plucking for eleven tracks,
    with minor variations only to justify the different song titles.</p><p>
    
    The musical foundation laid by Ben and Paul Harris (no relation), while completely
    uninspired, at least put a smile on my subwoofer more than once, which is more than
    I can say for the vocals.  Steve Smith's voice is the woeful centerpiece of nearly
    every cut, and whenever he and the music vie for attention, he comes out on top,
    which isn't generally a good thing.  The man's got a voice you'll either hate or
    <i>really</i> hate, like a cross between Michael Stipe and Dave Matthews, but with
    less range.  Therefore, I expect he'd be better suited to some faceless commercial
    alternative band than a hackneyed electronic outfit.  But hey, I'm not signed to
    Capitol so what the fuck do I know?</p><p>
    
    The real irony is that despite Steve's misplaced vocal attempts, <i>Dirty Vegas</i>
    would be tragically incomplete without him.  It's hard for me to imagine a musical
    concept more inept than building dance music around a vocal, but here it is; these
    songs are skeletons, and his voice is designed to hang on them.  It's no surprise,
    then, that ""Throwing Shapes,"" the lone instrumental offering, is the closest Dirty
    Vegas comes to pulling off anything worthy of a second listen.  But if you threw
    these guys that bone, you'd run the risk of hearing the first few seconds of the
    next track, ""Candles.""   For all of its three minutes and twelve seconds, this DMB
    cast-off made me curse the hand that gave me ears; I'm bitter just thinking about it.</p><p>
    
    So what does it all mean?  What does all of this ranting and raving portend for Dirty
    Vegas?  Why, naturally, they're going to do pretty well for themselves, because no one
    with an image like theirs needs something as trivial as talent or new ideas.  And just
    think-- if you've got crispy hair and a shiny shirt just like Steve Smith (blue-tinted
    shades are optional), or look like a casualty from a fight between Ratt and Flock of
    Seagulls like one of the Harrises, they might let you into their club.  Otherwise, I
    think you'll agree that music this tired should be put to sleep.  Thanks, Mitsubishi.</p></div>"|2333.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2333-dirty-vegas/|4.4|Eric Carr

    Hell, Nad Navillus might not even have either of those.  Thanks to his
    choice of musical approach, though, this guy will almost always be
    immediately grouped with forebears like Nick Drake and Van Morrison, a
    singing, songwriting wayfarer with an acoustic guitar and a penchant for
    the harmonic and soothing. Unfortunately, this also gets him grouped with
    some of his less talented indie contemporaries: the singing, songwriting
    wayfarers with acoustic guitars and a penchant for the self-absorbed and
    mind-numbing.</p><p>
    
    Good old Nad, though, is fortunate to have talent. He can actually play
    his guitar, and play it well. Super fucking well, to be honest, like 40
    minutes of the Leo Kottke workout.  Lots of that folksy arpeggiation
    here, nailed with dead-letter precision.  This, my friends, is the
    calling card of dear Nad, and that which separates him from his
    oft-clumsy genre mates.</p><p>
    
    Good thing, too, that his real name isn't Nad, which would be a dreadful
    stroke of misfortune, given that 'nad' is the singular of 'nads,' conversely
    either a feminine hair removal product, or slang for testicles (i.e. 'deez
    nutz').  Rather, Nad Navillus is, more or less, the golden-fingered Dan
    Sullivan, the man behind all of this album's songwriting and production
    work. He enlists some help on the album to play instruments he can't play
    quite as well as his six-string (e.g. the musical saw, courtesy of Joss
    Moorkens), but from what I can tell, Nad Navillus is Dan's baby.</p><p>
    
    Cute baby, too. It's a good, well-behaved little bugger, if not one that
    tends to sleep a lot.  But sleepytime may be the name of <i>your</i> game
    once you've reached track eight (""The Longest Straw""), where the fingerpicked
    guitar begins to glaze your senses like an ear-fog. By track ten (""Processional""),
    <i>Show Your Face</i> has definitely morphed from an ""I'm listening to this
    because it's interesting"" album to an ""I'm not paying attention, but I'm
    feeling alright"" sort of album. If only the ""Hot Licks"" guitar education
    series had a ""Hot Songs"" or maybe a ""Song Licks"" analogue to help Dan with
    his songwriting. Then he would inherit the Spirit of Nick Drake and his
    apotheosis would be complete. For now, however, Dan Sullivan awaits his
    anointing.</p><p>
    
    Oh shit! Did you notice this? Nad Navillus-- do you know what that is?
    It's DAN SULLIVAN fucking backwards. I just noticed that. How sneaky! We
    should call him Clever Dan from now on. Or would it be Nad Revelc? Hmmm?
    And hold on here just a damn moment: now that I'm getting into this
    whole ""find out who the artist actually is"" thing, I'll have you know
    that Danny boy is a 'touring member' of Songs: Ohia. Who'd have figured
    that? Hey now!</p><p>
    
    I just sat here for 10 minutes, thinking of how I could totally waste
    Dan for tricking me so bad. But alas, I cannot, for Dan is pretty
    stinkin' good. Not great, but on the scale of stinkin' goodness, Dan is
    definitely above average. He's got the talent, he's got his calling card
    (read: distinctiveness), and he's a clever piece of work. If you own a
    coffee shop, you could surely buy this disc and play it for the benefit
    of your stimulant-swilling customers. Similarly, if you have time to
    waste on Sunday mornings and don't have money for a jazz brunch at
    the Hilton, Dan may also be your solution (I hear he goes well with
    sausage). And finally, if you're a member of Songs: Ohia, you could
    pay Dan a few bucks, take him on tour with you, and maybe even teach
    him the virtues of quality songsmithing.  Then we'd really have
    something worth writing about!</p></div>"|5727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5727-show-your-face/|7.0|Brad Haywood

Poor guys, they
    survived <i>John Henry</i>, one of the least interesting albums ever released.  And bless their hearts,
    their last album-- their most fun since the eighties-- bore the ugly street date of September 11th,
    2001, and Pitchfork centurion Matt LeMay crucified it, etching 2.8 onto its tomb.</p><p>
    
    Crawl into my porcelain Nostalgidildo: back in the day, TMBG lingered in a strange new section at the
    Oak Nook Mall's Record Bar, a section called ""alternative"" which they shared with a host of quirktastic
    acts such as Suicidal Tendencies, The Pixies, Dead Milkmen, Siouxsie with Banshees, and Violent Femmes.
    The big time didn't want them.  On MTV's ""Randee of the Redwoods"" special (a production that Flansburgh
    told me in an interview was run by some cocaine-pocked simps), they opened for Run-DMC. Everyone in the
    crowd froze, allowing their rejection to manifest.  Hard to believe that these Brooklyn art-punks
    would go on to earn a grubby Grammy for the theme song to a clunky TV show.</p><p>
    
    In 2002, this children's album is a logical move, since any hardcore fans who still swear by this band are
    obviously suffering from arrested development, and since any passive fans who remember when TMBG were the
    freshest thing going now have ten grandkids to babysit. But what song from the band's first ten years
    wouldn't already multitask as kiddie fodder?  As-is, ""Toddler Hiway"" and ""Whistling In the Dark"" were safe
    for the I-can-poop-solo set. Cartoon shows were already co-opting their standard fare. ""Particle Man"" is
    otherwise known as ""Smells Like Toddler Spirit.""  What the hell-hey?</p><p>
    
    That's where they get ya: this album is really a subversive, anarchic manifesto, brimming with songs about
    cultural revolution and plunging hypodermic needles into scrotums.  Aw, I'm just joshing.  It's this spiked
    Ovaltine, making everything feisty and asymmetric.  The album is surprisingly agenda-free, considering how
    dread-mired and literately jaded their best work is/was.  I was thinking, ""TMBG's going to get their
    depressive hooks into the whippersnappers of the Baby Gap Generation-- thass tight!"" But nay, a thousand
    times nay, this album mercifully prefers to dangle kids over their toyboxes rather than over the abyss of
    their potentially meaningless existence.</p><p>
    
    Several songs provide that patented, relentlessly melodic, fitful polka you either love or hate. Among the
    best are the lie-happy ""Fibber Island,"" the quantum-leaping ""Four of Two,"" the exponentially multiplying
    ""The House at the Top of the Tree,"" and the kinda-dumb ""Sleepwalkers.""  ""Robot Parade,"" one of several old
    songs reworked here, is a vocoded nightmare of a cyborg utopia and it's just as grand on disc as it is live
    (I'd prefer TMBG's smarmy, vaudevillian anti-banter over some Indie-Cum-Lately's Junior Jeff Buckley leers
    and deepness-displaying segues any day).</p><p>
    
    The song ""No!"" manages to be an effective, mildly nihilistic look at how much of kids' conversations and
    desires end in negation. ""Violin"" is as insane and surreal as classics like ""Boat of Car,"" as it repeats
    the words ""hippo"" and ""mop,"" and then slices up the head of George Washington. ""In the Middle"" covers a
    public service announcement about the hazards of pedestrianhood. Live nugget ""I Am Not Your Broom,"" and
    ""I Am a Grocery Bag"" are sung, predictably, from the point of view of inanimate objects, though only ""Broom""
    sustains a metaphorical heft, as the pre-leafblower organic tool tires of being exploited. The
    consumer-product-listing ""Grocery Bag"" is particularly a stoop for the band that penned <i>Flood</i>'s
    ""Dead,"" a song that presented the plight of yon coupon-clipping grocery shopper as being on par with the
    cyclic horror of Sisyphus pushing his rigged rock up a pointless hill.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>No!</i> consists of oddly considerate and patient full-on kids' songs, meaning that they're
    repetitive and sometimes even ""Teletubbies""-caliber stupefying (although ""Wake Up Call,"" which repeats the
    syllable 'bo' 135+ times, is somehow still a hit). The disc is enhanced with gleefully absurd, marginally
    interactive cartoons, and packed with that Eisenhower-era zip-twinkle.  And never once do the Johns go so
    nasal that you wince with their every exhortation.  Those of you who arrived at Pitchforkmedia.com via a
    sick, degenerate teleology of Tool-to-Promise Ring-to-Pinback might not understand the need to give TMBG
    props, at least as talented multi-instrumentalists.  Well, keep sewing those patches on your Eastpaks, and
    try to understand that this kid-disc was critic-proof. Who wants to be the dickhead to trash something for
    the wee demo? It's like those Michelin commercials with the ""whole lot riding on your tires."" They beg the
    question: do you want to kill babies, FREAK? You unhurdlable ASSHOLE!</p><p>
    
    Respect is due, yo. TMBG still runs a dial-a-song service. They're the focus of a flick, <i>Gigantic</i>,
    coming to an arthouse near you and featuring the praise of empowered pop-vulture Dave Eggers. They used to
    quote Wallace Stevens and sing that youth culture killed their dog, and that they hope they get old before
    they die.  But now, all crick-nicked, they don't give a damn that Shakespeare's kid-unfriendly Lady
    MacBeth said that she would handle a kid by acting ""while it was my smiling in face;"" she would ""have
    plucked my nipple from his boneless gums/ And dashed the brains out.""  TMBG doesn't care that poet Phillip
    Larkin noted that ""they fuck you up, your mum and dad,"" and that you should ""get out as early as you can/
    and don't have any kids yourself.""  Or that Nickelodeon prints up pamphlets like the ""What We Know About
    Kids"" dossier that a friend smuggled to me, arguing that kids are ""armed with brand influences"" and that
    ""kids' fast food preference is confirmed!""</p><p>
    
    A They Might Be Giants record is one of the last places from which you'd expect hope for a generation of
    attention-bags that won't remember ad-free space, and that begins every sentence with ""I want."" And TMBG
    are probably harbingers of an era when old-guard 'alternative' standouts reach out to kids. Look forward
    to Sonic Youth's <i>Playpen Cesspool</i> and Unca Lou Barlow's <i>Don't Rub Flimsy</i>.</p></div>"|7995.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7995-no/|7.0|William Bowers

I've had it.  Is this what we've been reduced to?
    Michigan metalheads copping ESPN </i>Jock Jams<i>, capitalizing on the shameful
    worst of the 1980s and bellowing incessantly about the wondrous virtues of the
    all-nighter?  Rock critics who dissed this entire genre in its heyday now
    glorifying its second coming as somehow superior?  If this is what the future
    of music has in store for us, why no apocalypse on New Year's Eve '99?  Doesn't
    God care?  Shit, maybe Y2K really </i>was<i> Armageddon, launching us headfirst
    into a great black xFC-metal abyss, and maybe Andrew W.K. is just the first of
    four pending horsemen.</i></p><p>
    And that, boys and girls, was about all I could muster on March 20th, just as
    the stormclouds began to crash together for what would soon spin into a
    torrential whirlwind of one-sheets and <i>NME</i>s-- maybe one of the scariest
    hypes this planet's ever seen.  I was overwhelmed!</p><p>
    But now it's July, and almost as quickly as he arrived, Andrew Wilkes-Krier has
    been rudely ushered off the Apollo soundstage and scribbled as a footnote into
    history's textbook of rock novelties.  Been months since I last heard ""Party Hard""
    on the radio or saw WK thrashing about on M2 like a hyperactive retarded kid whose
    parents failed to give him a disciplinary shaking.  If it hadn't been for
    this meddling CD-R I was sent by Island Records' promotions team, I might already
    have forgotten the guy.  Ahh, but yes, in due time.  I take immense comfort in the
    realization that, at some distant point in the future, I won't be able to recall
    any of <i>I Get Wet</i>, and whether that'll be due to its legitimate forgetability
    or a future struggle with Alzheimer's I don't much care, so long as I never again
    have to envision his mangy ""RAW is WAR"" hairswath (wash it!), or listen to these
    unshakable cro-magnon shoutathons.  And so, this is where I get to say that, as
    evidenced in italics above, I <i>almost</i> told you so.</p><p>
    A few weeks prior to my first attempt at taking down this sorry sack, my old pal
    Brent DiCrescenzo, who as a culture addict spends a fair bit of his spare time
    scouring the British music rags, had swung by to write up the Promise Ring's
    <i>Wood/Water</i>.  He'd read about <i>I Get Wet</i> in <i>Mojo</i> or something,
    and saw it amongst the promo stacks on my windowsill.  ""Have you heard this?""</p><p>
    Now, Brent and I like to hook up and get cynical from time to time-- we'll even
    bash the bands we're into just for shits-- so I was patiently waiting for D to reel
    one off so I could start in, casting to the wind that fact that I, in fact, hadn't
    yet heard it.  ""It's pretty funny, it's basically these huge guitar riffs, sort of
    soccer anthems.""  He quickly unloaded Von Bohlen from the disc-changer (well into
    <i>Wood/Water</i>'s second half, any excuse would have sufficed) and tossed in the
    CD-R.  Instantly, blaring multitracked guitars and shooting-range stadium drums
    came accosting.  I tried to yell something, but my exclamation was swallowed by
    the immense wind-tunnel attack of the clenched-fist maelstrom.</p><p>
<i>""WHAT?""</i></p><p>
    It was hopeless.  Nothing could penetrate a sound that dense.  I was overcome.
    I tried to remember the last time anyone dared to push rock so poppily over the
    top, and figured it must have been some time around <i>Hysteria</i>.  I sat rapt
    by the simple barbarity of that sound, Andrew barking adamantly over the exploding
    plastic fury.  <i>The gall!</i>  WK demanded respect, whether he deserved it
    or not.  His conviction was startling, and the sound so scrutinously polished
    it lapped itself back into rawness.  Indeed, it <i>was</i> time to party.</p><p>
    The party, as it just so happened, lasted all of three minutes-- appropriately,
    about the same lifespan as a pinch of Big League Chew.  For this was bubblegum
    in its purest, stickiest form, designed for the sole purpose of imminent pop.
    To be packaged, marketed, and shipped by a grand corporation, and to be enjoyed
    by the consumer for a few moments before being spit or swallowed.  I spat, and
    with the poisonous substance expelled from my system, I saw it for what it is:</p><p>
<i>I Get Wet</i> is an insidious beast, planting itself into the deepest
    instinctual recesses of your brainstem, where it instantly detonates in a
    visceral adrenal charge.  There is suddenly no respect for proper behavior,
    just the urge to turn acrobatic flips and smash everything within a fifty-foot
    radius.  You're Genghis Khan in the San Dimas Sportmart somersaulting over Nike
    racks to the <i>Slippery When Wet</i> synth-metal of Beethoven's Schmidt Music
    foray into Bachman-Turner Overdrive.  And then you wake up the next morning,
    hazy-headed and groggy, humiliated by the preceding night's incidents.  Don't
    blame yourself.  This music is evil in its purest form, wafting through air,
    waiting to possess every decent person in the entire room until they're flat
    on their backs in bed, wrists tied to the headboard, with drunken priests
    standing holy at their sides to exorcise the demon.</p><p>
    And the demon is a tricky sonofabitch, spinning you in circles of confusion
    and chanting its life-affirming message to brainwash you into truly believing,
    right to the core of your soul, that what it speaks is the Good Truth. Read
    any interview with WK (they're all the same-- just like the songs!) in which
    he spews naïve positivity like dad's warbly old self-help cassettes.  There
    is no irony about Andrew.  He is, in fact, <i>so earnest</i> it sends any
    straight-thinking individual into epileptic fits of shivers and winces.  For
    christ's sake, the man opens the second paragraph of his self-writ bio with
    ""I will work every day to feel O.K."" before finally getting around to calling
    the music ""perfect"" because ""all it wants is for people to be happy.""  LIES!</p><p>
    This here is about as empty as rock music gets, right down to the tinny, digitally
    processed tonebank noise that passes for 'guitars.'  You think otherwise?  Then
    let's have a moment to look at the obvious points of reference-- the songs and
    bands to which <i>I Get Wet</i> rightfully owes a sizable chunk of its royalties:</p><p>
<li> Def Leppard: ""Pour Some Sugar on Me""<br/>
    Oooooh, in the name of love!  This one boomed from your older sister's boyfriend's
    Thunderbird all 1987 long.  You'd look out on the driveway with envy from your
    bedroom window.  <i>Dude is BAD!</i>, you'd mouth, examining just exactly the
    angle and velocity at which he'd bang that head, his bleached-blonde mane tossing
    about in a fire-eyed, glorious salute to Rick Allen's one-armed colossus.  But that
    one time he drove you to your girlfriend's house and you excitedly rummaged through
    his tapes, you saw truth in his glove compartment: this guy <i>only</i> listened to
    Def Leppard!  And you turned to him wondering, ""Hey, don't you have any <i>real</i>
    rock in here?""  And that's when he stomped the brake and charlie-horsed your bicep
    with the force of ten silverbacks.<p>
<li> Gary Glitter: ""Rock &amp; Roll, Part Two""<br/>
    You know this one, even if you don't know it by name.  <i>Bah-badahhhhhh-- HAY!
    Bah-badah.</i>  And repeat.  That's all there is to this one, kiddies.  You hear
    it at soccer games.  Maybe football half-times, too, or anywhere there's a bunch
    of boneheaded fools spraying each other with keg nozzles in fits of homoerotic
    glory.  ""HAY!,"" the song's sacred battle cry, really drives home the victory,
    even when the hometeam gets their ass handed to 'em by Kansas City.  You only need
    to hear one bar of this song to know it forward and back for the rest of your days.
    It also screams ""beer"" louder than any Anheiser-Busch logo or beef-eating Steelers
    fan un-pantsing himself to reveal a secret team-praising message on his pimpled
    asscheeks.<p>
<li>Baha Men: ""Who Let the Dogs Out?""<br/>
    A song whose chorus roused Arsenio crowds and 6-year-olds with the life-bending
    lyric, ""OOF! OOF! OOF OOF!""  Like an inescapable, overlong Geico commercial booming
    from Jeeps, Escalades and Honda Civics across this nation's every city, ""Who Let
    the Dogs Out?"" was at once your worst nightmare and the everyman's personal nirvana.
    If this song had a verse, it was added as an afterthought to give this asinine
    catchphrase the illusion of being an actual song. And it's not over yet: I'm
    thinking three months tops before we see it pushing Beggin' Strips between 'boot
    camp' segments on <i>Maury</i>.<p>
    Hmm, incriminating.  Not the kind of legacy one works toward securing, and certainly
    not the kind of music you'd find in the collection of any self-respecting rock elitist.
    In fact, if I knew a rock elitist with this record, I'd smack them up 'long side the
    head, 'cause who the fuck are you to tell me I can't own the Sophie B. Hawkins ""Damn,
    I Wish I Was Your Lover"" CD5 when just last week you subjected the entire fucking
    interstate to ""Fun Night""?  I'll cripple ya!</p><p>
    And yet, some of these 'punk' and 'indie' kids are still willing to back WK up with a
    number of ridiculous excuses that they deep-down <i>know</i> are inherently flawed.
    ""It's catchy"" is no kind of argument.  Every pop song you've ever truly hated is
    catchy.  ""It's ironic"" is wack, too, since there's exactly zero irony to be had on
    any of <i>I Get Wet</i> or in WK's motivational interviews.  ""It's fun"" is about the

    ""Where, oh where is that next great Seattle-based supergroup?"" Likewise, zoologists everywhere have recently
    been overheard asking themselves, ""Where, oh where is that next great band named after a small burrowing
    reptile indigenous to New Zealand and small surrounding islands?""  Well, rejoice, because the wait is over.
    Actually, the wait was technically over around 1996 when this here band Tuatara formed and recorded their
    first album, but everyone pretty much forgot about them about two months after <i>Breaking the Ethers</i>
    was released straight to cut-out bin.  That record, to put it gently, sucked the almighty ass.  Hence, when
    <i>Trading with the Enemy</i> got issued in 1998, nobody gave half a shit.</p><p>
    
    Let's cut to the chase, though: <i>Cinemathique</i> is really terrible, especially for a third album.  So
    bad is this record, in fact, that I can't even manufacture any smartass sarcastic excitement over it.
    Part of what I've told you so far is true, though: Tuatara is a 'supergroup,' in at least a few different
    senses of the word.  They are large in number-- 11 to be exact-- so you could safely say they are a
    super-sized group. And counted among the lofty ranks of Tuatara is a fairly stellar group of individuals
    in terms of name recognition. Completely tracing the bloodlines of this group would take a
    Church-of-Latter-Day-Saints-trained genealogist. Peter Buck of REM is the supermost of said supergroup,
    followed in superness by fellow Minus 5 member and former Young Fresh Fellow Scott McCaughey. Justin
    Harwood from Luna and Screaming Trees' drummer Barrett Martin are both somewhat super, I suppose.  And
    this core is joined by a who's-who of indie rock sidemen and session pros, men and women who have appeared
    on albums ranging from Les Claypool's <i>Frog Brigade</i> to <i>Trout Fishing in America</i>.  However,
    just because you're a supergroup in a purely technical sense doesn't mean you're a super group, understand?</p><p>
    
    As you might expect, <i>Cinemathique</i> presents us with soundtrack-style music. And judging from the cover
    art, you might presume that the film being soundtracked here is some sort of unholy <i>Tron</i>-meets-<i>Caligula</i>
    project (sorta like <i>Femalien</i>), but you'd be wrong. There actually is no film.  If someone got it
    in their head to make one based on the music of <i>Cinemathique</i>, though, it'd end up something like a
    South Pacific/Bollywood-sci-fi-noir-porn (think <i>Tron</i>-meets-<i>Caligula</i>).</p><p>
    
    Back in the day (circa Temple of the Dog), tossing light instrumental jazz, by-the-numbers lounge groove,
    and bongo-fueled world beat onto one record might have been a pretty risky move. But here it is 2002, and
    the soundtrack music renaissance has passed its golden age, allowing this bastard horror of an LP to come
    off like a clueless cash-in.  In its defense, <i>Cinemathique</i>'s range is impressive from a strictly
    musical standpoint. Tuatara offer a proficient exotica vibe, a decent 70s-style cop show car chase theme,
    a funky porn-style number, and even a bit of Gamelan.  Problem is, I just don't buy it.</p><p>
    
    The strange thing is that the pitfalls that usually plague these sorts of all-star gatherings-- namely the
    ""too-many-cooks-in the-kitchen-syndrome""-- isn't the issue here.  You see, perhaps wisely sensing this
    potential problem, the entire cast of Tuatara decided to step into the background, opting to leave at home
    any personality they might have brought to the project.  And with this many distinct voices involved, the
    strategy might have worked-- that is, if somebody, <i>anybody</i> had picked up the ball and ran with it.
    I waited patiently for this to happen.  It didn't.  And so, nothing ever stands out: no idiosyncrasy, no
    weirdness, nothing. Supergroups are supposed to chock themselves with an overabundance of personality;
    this one just kinda coughs up a gray lump of room-temperature phlegm that could have been the product of
    any sick little boy, or halfway proficient (i.e. far from super) group of musicians.</p><p>
    
    The closest thing <i>Cinemathique</i> has to a lead voice is the saxophone, but even this fine instrument
    fails them.  Oftentimes, it has the group coming off like a peppier Morphine-- which is to say, Morphine
    devoid of darkness, which naturally defeats the whole purpose.  Actually, it's like the sax player for an
    airport hotel bar band found a Morphine cassette in his daughter's car and thought it would be fun to try
    it out with the boys in the band, aiming for a smoky distant vibe of which he has no real clue.</p><p>
    
    Even so, <i>Cinemathique</i> is not unbearably irritating, and the musicianship is technically admirable
    if you're into proficiency for proficiency's sake (Dream Theater fans, I'm talkin' at you).  As for me,
    I'd actually rather listen to Temple of the Dog-- something I can't say for too many records-- because at
    least then I might have some sense of who's doing what.  Hey, better yet, where's that Flying Lizards album?</p></div>"|8180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8180-cinemathique/|3.0|Jason Nickey

    firmly entrenched in the untouchable class, somewhere
    between interview picture discs and free record label
    samplers.  In the days before file-sharing made
    cherry-picking your favorite band's every comp
    contribution wallet-free, tribute albums were certified
    quick buy-and-sell-back items (<i>Sweet Relief</i>,
    anyone?).  But while the durability of such cover
    collections is questionable, tribute albums have
    a certain reference tool value, allowing listeners
    to suss out connections on rock 'n' roll's gigantic
    influence web.</p><p>
    
    In the case of the Kinks, this research is especially
    interesting, given that the Davies Bros. &amp; cast have
    one of rock history's highest influence-to-sales
    ratios (in the colonies, at least).  Were it not for
    MTV oddity ""Come Dancing,"" the Kinks would rank as the
    most important sixties band my parents have never
    heard of, and Joe Middle America would probably think
    the masterpiece whine of ""You Really Got Me"" was by
    the same band that did ""Wooly Bully.""  But as Britpop
    dance nights, Wes Anderson soundtracks and prep school
    blazer sales figures show, the Kinks legacy still
    maintains a subcutaneous legacy in the global music
    economy.</p><p>
    
    Add to that list of evidence <i>This Is Where I Belong</i>,
    which, with bands like Lambchop, Yo La Tengo, Jonathan
    Richman, and Josh Rouse all kissing the papal ring,
    has a hipster quotient through the roof.  The collection
    also scores high on the stylistic variety scale, with
    bossa nova heiress Bebel Gilberto, soul-patch endorsers
    Queens of the Stone Age, and traditional bluegrass
    picker Tim O'Brien making their first and last unified
    appearance.  All comers are subjected to the highly
    mathematical tribute album formula, as explained by guest
    commentator John Nash:</p><p>
<i>""How much their chosen cover (C) resembles the
    original (O) is directly proportional to the
    percentage of influence (I) the band-of-honor
    exerts over the artist.  C/O=%I""</i></p><p>
    
    Thanks, John.  Unsurprisingly, the people who score
    the highest on this formula (and, thus, are certified
    as the most notorious Kinks imitators), are America's
    power-pop elite: Fountains of Wayne, Matthew Sweet,
    The Minus 5, Fastball.  All turn in barely altered
    takes on Kinks catalog items, adding little more than
    guitar volume to the original.  It's pleasant to hear,
    as songs like ""Big Sky"" (Sweet) and ""Better Things""
    (Fountains of Wayne) are like batting practice pitches
    to their cover artist, but the lack of tweakage makes
    for a rather inessential product.  On the other hand,
    hearing Queens of the Stone Age turn in a note-perfect
    (down to the piano pounding) take on ""Who'll Be the
    Next in Line"" is more rewarding, given that it's
    completely unexpected from the stoner rock revivalists.</p><p>
    
    Even better are the more risky reimaginations of
    Klassik Kinks by bands whose admiration for Davies
    is kept separate from any significant sonic influence
    upon their own aesthetic.  Lambchop's choice of the
    creepy 80s pedophile tale ""Art Lover"" falls right in
    place with Wagner's trademark lyrical oddness, but
    it's given the sleepy quasi-lounge lushness of the
    band's pre-<i>Is a Woman</i> work.  Also choosing
    atmosphere over skinny-tie attitude are Yo La Tengo
    (longtime Davies' worshipers) who craft a psychedelic
    haze around early artifact ""Fancy,"" and Josh Rouse,
    whose ""Well Respected Man"" is nicely lacquered with
    the Chicago sound.</p><p>
    
    Then you've got the gimmicky stuff, like the
    endorsements of Kinks genre explorations by authentic
    practitioners (Gilberto's ""No Return,"" O'Brien's
    ""Muswell Hillbilly"") and the big finale appearance of
    the honoree himself, alongside Kinks Fan Club
    President Damon Albarn.  All told, it's a stout
    compilation-- the only real stinker of the group is
    Cracker horribly mauling ""Victoria"" with their
    American accents-- but with the general handicap of
    all tribute albums (the scale only goes up to 7 for
    'em), it's still nowhere near essential.  Worst of all,
    given recent RIAA action, Lambchop and Fastball
    archivists might just have to <i>buy</i> the darn thing.

So ol' Bill rowed over from France
    with a big army, landed on some sunless beach and set up camp. He and his cronies then rode around the
    country, bludgeoned the serfs, raped the horses, and rode off on the women. Pretty soon, Bill had the
    whole place under his thumb. Then, to add insult to injury, he made everybody speak French, which was
    kind of a bastard thing to do, but he did it anyway and we continue to bear the scar to this day with
    all our '-tion' endings and whatnot. So you can't really blame the medieval Brits for-- when forced to
    consign this indignity over to history-- choosing to transcribe the conquest into pictures instead of
    words.</p><p>
    
    What they ended up making to explain the whole invasion is called the Bayeux Tapestry. Many a teacher
    makes a big deal out of it in art history classes. It's one of those precious works of art you might run
    across on PBS to the drone of some fantastically boring British historian. Altogether, the 'tapestry' is
    about the size of a roll of toilet paper rolled all the way out, so it's not really a tapestry in the
    big, square, wall-hanging sense people are used to. It's a lengthy, linear deal that never truly completes
    itself. It is woven history that runs on like the number pi, the events like beads on a string.</p><p>
    
    Kinda the same thing with DJ Jester, aka the Filipino Fist out of San Antonio, and his debut album <i>River
    Walk Riots</i>.  Jester has gone off and made a genuinely
    entertaining album by blending some of the most utterly disparate recordings ever. There's a lot to be
    said for the amount of weaving that goes into an album of this kind. The man effortlessly references
    a plethora of movies, songs, voices and hooks without boring you for a second, and creates three cohesive
    12-minute-long ""segments,"" as he calls them. So it's completely natural to go off calling it a tapestry,
    or even a quilt if you're so inclined. Thing is, that would be implying there's a completeness here when,
    in actuality, there is certainly not. On <i>River Walk Riots</i>, Jester's all about stringing it along,
    following one crazy track with another, one-upping the last goofy song till he's got yards of 'em behind
    him. His samples, no matter how catchy, tend to pass by like billboards.</p><p>
    
    At points you start to wish he'd produce something resembling a traditional song, or that some sort of
    pattern would emerge from the long string of mixes-- a long series of cleverly intertwined songs does not
    a song make. Still, the man does a good job of keeping your head bobbing, and you begin to understand that
    he's not necessarily out to create a turntable opera like Q-Bert or Kid Koala.  Rather, this guy's about
    keeping the party moving, and this is one hot mix. There's no shortage of turntablism tricks and maneuvers.
    His scratching is fresh and innovative, and the mixing is absolutely seamless. His sense of humor is on par
    with Koala, and it comes off in the joy he elicits by slapping a drum beat beneath an otherwise hokey cowboy
    ballad or by sampling Richard Simmons.</p><p>
    
    Jester does, however, pull off a small coup with a Willie Nelson track he exploits to transform into a sort
    of emcee's lament. Willie pines away over a drumbeat courtesy of Jester and gets hip-hop relevant when he
    waxes nostalgic and croons about his ""life and times"" and ""some bad rhymes.""  To top it off, there're
    Jester's unassailable credentials: the likes of Ice-T, Rob Swift, the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, Rahzel of
    the Roots, and of course, Willie Nelson all provide their props before the album gets underway.  You
    know there ain't no messin' around when Ice-T's gotcha back: ""Yo, shut up, this is Ice-T, nigga, chilling
    with my man DJ Jester. Act like you know bitch, 'cause this shit is all real."" What else do you need?
    Jester samples Iron Butterfly, Run DMC, MARRS, Ennio Morricone, Hank Williams, Black Sabbath, the Beastie
    Boys, James Brown, Charles Manson, Bob Marley and even Pavement. You have to hear it to believe it. So just
    silence yourself, get in your inner tube and enjoy the ride. The river may be long, but it is also funky.</p></div>"|2362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2362-river-walk-riots/|7.0|Keith Brasel

I mean, you
    give a fancy overseas war with high production values to a country of TV-addled youth whose
    social outreach extends to the local pharmacy waiting line, and what do they do?  They don't
    even wait for their nation to be occupied by a warring fascist state before chronicling their

    Congratulations, you have just taken part in the world's first documented 'interactive
    litmus test by means of musical criticism.' Judge yourself accordingly. If the
    pointlessness of that premise aggravated the shit out of you, you may be ready to listen
    to Pretty Girls Make Graves. If it was the pretentious upper-crust literati ambience that
    hung on every word like that layer of filth you just can't wash off, I advise you to go
    out and pick up the band's Lookout! Records debut, <i>Good Health</i>, before your roommates
    finish funneling last night's meal of crumbled snack crackers into your gas tank (go check
    outside). But, if you actually followed along with the introduction, finding it to be replete
    with factual and historical inaccuracies only to relish the idea of writing an email to
    point out your humble reviewer's misconceptions and snobbery, you'd fuggin' hate this
    record.  Likewise, if you actually enjoyed that thing: we don't want you as a reader.</p><p>
    Excuse me if I'm a little selective in which faction of my demographic I actually reach,
    but, you see, I've developed a pretty tenuous relationship with <i>Good Health</i> over
    the past month or so, and I don't want just any underprivileged twenty-something getting
    their hands on it. The truth of the matter is, Pretty Girls Make Graves are in <i>your
    town</i> right now recruiting the disaffected, cynical, and pissed off to join their cause.
    Finally, another group that the impoverished slacker bourgeoisie can champion as 'a really
    good punk band.' Seriously, Tim Harrington's shoulders feel so much lighter now.</p><p>
    The album opens innocuously enough, as a bubbling synth rises warily up and down an
    infectious melody that lingers just long enough to establish itself before dissipating
    into a torrent of guitars. The knowing lyrics of ""Speakers Push the Air"" chime: ""I found
    a place where it feels alright/ I heard a record and it opened my eyes."" Elsewhere, an
    untitled epilogue to ""The Get Away,"" one of the record's finest moments, exposes the 'epic'
    song's skeletal foundation to the listener for thirty seconds or so, allowing us some
    time to breathe. Fortunately, oxygen breaks are few and far between.</p><p>
    While underground America's musical landscape seems ruled by a vast court of unskilled
    musicians content with simply bastardizing their lo-fi influences whilst betting on the
    medium's once-staple-now-long-lost-and-forgotten 'cute and intimate' card (an infamous
    artifact from the early-to-mid-nineties which has recently been sighted somewhere near
    Olympia, Washington), Pretty Girls Make Graves wear their technical prowess like a
    badge of honor.</p><p>
    Though never letting the 'Guitarist's Grimoire' set the parameters for their sound,
    PGMG manage to juxtapose riff-concentrate with enough perspective and focus to escape
    even the faintest grasps of what could have devolved into 'virtuoso punk' under less
    inspired hands. However, the fact that ex-Murder City Devils bassist Derek Fudesco
    established Pretty Girls Make Graves only months after the dissolution of his former
    group, insinuates that the nine songs comprising <i>Good Health</i> were written in an
    inordinately condensed period of time. Where such circumstances are, more often than
    not, a hindrance to the potential quality of a final product, Pretty Girls are clear
    beneficiaries of this situation, as the short allotment of time seems to have
    contributed to the sense of urgency found in both the group's writing and performance.</p><p>
    Conjuring up a direct musical comparison to Pretty Girls Make Graves proves difficult,
    as the album plays like an aural amalgam of the past 40 years or so of rock music
    (though Sonic Youth, Unwound and Les Savy Fav all serve as dandy reference points).
    Similarly, it's tough to ferret a particular quality to scapegoat in the name of
    objective criticism. But, if there's any negative criticism to be had, it should be
    focused solely on the disc's hit-or-miss lyrical content. The unfortunate truth is
    that even a slight misjudgment of the line delineating revelation from callow
    self-concern can render a modest album/song unlistenable. Luckily, there aren't
    any cringe-worthy moments to be found here-- just a few lines written from inexperience
    and masked by singer Andrea Zollo's innate sense of melody. It's her commanding voice
    that's truly the group's most effective instrument, infusing the genre with formerly
    unseen emotional layers.</p><p>
    When each track is a struggle to contain as many Pixies-by-way-of-Archers-of-Loaf riffs
    and hooks as humanly possible in less than three minutes, you need someone manning
    the controls well enough to keep the music's instinctual and emotional appeal intact.
    Bolstered by engineering guru Phil Ek's gracious production (which never oversteps its
    bounds, more than making up for his overbearing work on <i>Ancient Melodies of the
    Future</i>), <i>Good Health</i> serves as a testament to the punk idiom-- a homogenate
    product of the genre's countless guises and forms. ""Ghosts in the Radio,"" the album's
    obvious highlight, even boasts a successful Fripp/Eno-esque breakdown mid-song,
    indicative of the group's ability to meld rampant experimentalism with an evocative and
    accessible commodity.</p><p>
    Though not as epic and cinematic as the Trail of Dead's galvanizing <i>Source Tags &amp;
    Codes</i>, Pretty Girls Make Graves act as yet another healthy pulse sign for indie-rock
    outside of M2's adopted garage-rock revivalist spectrum. While it's true that everything
    contained herein has been done before in some form or another, <i>Good Health</i> succeeds
    on its own merits due to its impassioned delivery and inexorable performances. More than
    just a faithful document to the group's incendiary live prowess, the record somehow
    approximates the environs of a good indie-rock show. That, in itself, is always worth
    the price of admission.</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|6465.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6465-good-health/|9.2|Kevin Adickes

    the truth is that we're often very predictable marketing tools who can be easily manipulated
    by using a proper set of variables. And <i>God Loves Ugly</i> is chock full of critic yumminess:
    ""emotionally resonant"" lyrics that ""betray an inner-vulnerability""; ""minimalist"" old-school
    beats that ""shimmer"" with an ""understated grace""; the requisite indie record label that is
    surely a ""breeding ground for unearthed genius""-- you get the picture.  But a funny thing
    happened on the way to Atmosphere's coronation; instead of effortlessly wearing the crown
    of critic's darling, <i>God Loves Ugly</i> is a whiny, heavily affected mess that tries oh
    so hard, yet ultimately seems as empty and manipulative as the latest Ruff Ryders or Bad Boy
    album.</p><p>
    
    For those of you unfamiliar with the Atmosphere plotline, Slug (born Sean Daley) is the sort
    of self-depreciating, slacker anti-hero that we've all come to love over the years.  Shit,
    slap a flannel on him, give him a guitar, and he could easily pass for a grunge god (MC
    Vedder, perhaps?). His resume includes a Midwestern upbringing that left him both disaffected
    and rootless, a failed romance that he endlessly obsesses over (a la Eminem's ""Kim""), and a
    streak of self-depreciation that both preempts any potential criticism and conveys a veneer
    of detachment and apathy (a modern hipster must).  Together with producer Ant and MC Spawn
    (who has since departed), Slug released one brilliant but underappreciated gem (1999's
    <i>Overcast</i>) and a string of widely heralded but rarely purchased EPs that were collected
    on last year's widely revered <i>Lucy Ford</i>.  After constant touring, Atmosphere silently
    became the 'next big thing' in underground hip-hop, a particularly impressive achievement
    considering the bi-coastal regionalism of the genre.  Their recent show at San Francisco's
    Slim's drew one of the largest hip-hop crowds the place had ever seen. What's more surprising
    is that a majority of them were the under-21 suburbanite crowd that has made Eminem so popular.</p><p>
    
    So the expectations for <i>God Loves Ugly</i> have been very, very high.  And it doesn't always
    disappoint: ""Blamegame"" boasts some of the dopest dub on the mainland; ""Hair"" is an amusing
    enough account of an initial foray into groupie-land; and Slug injects the album with some
    great lines. On ""A Song About a Friend"" he raps, ""It'll all be so simple if I were rich, but
    I'm not/ So I compensate with thought/ I got a lot of nothing that you need to know.""  And the
    moments of pseudo-philosophical, backpacker-attracting navel-giving are still there. On ""Loveline""
    he ponders: ""A soul is a soul and a shell is a shell/ The border in between is full of everything
    you felt.../ Everytime I look within I recognize the darkness/ Familiar to the image of the artist.""
    Deep, yo.</p><p>
    
    Really, all the elements that made <i>Lucy Ford</i> and <i>Overcast</i> so hot are still present.
    But whereas those two albums sounded like the intellectually complex basement revelations of an
    emotionally exhausted yet stubbornly resilient young man-of-the-world, <i>God Loves Ugly</i> has
    a forced and formulaic undercurrent that, despite how hard I tried to look past it, was unmistakable
    and pervasive.  No longer are we hearing the confessions of Sean Daley. Those sweet, innocent days
    have been replaced by a more violent malaise seemingly calculated to resemble a certain white rap
    phenomenon who melts in your mouth and not in your hands.  Instead of Slug, we have the caricature
    of Slug: a deeply disaffected young man who, in ""The Bass and the Movement,"" even makes a somewhat
    tepid attempt to flex, threatening those who don't feel him to ""stuff them full of dick 'till the
    hole rips."" Good fucking God! That's almost as nice as Tyson telling a reporter that he was going
    to ""fuck [him] up the ass 'till [he's] not a faggot anymore.""</p><p>
    
    Aside from the album's faux-aggression,
    I can't help feel that Slug has dumbed down some of his sentiments for the sake of accessibility.
    ""The Modern Man's Hustle"" may be Atmosphere's most popular song to date, but it's also their most
    easily disposable. Even Ant's beats have lost their charm. Instead of being delicate, lo-fi
    constructions, they now sound monolithic, commercial, and just plain boring. ""Flesh"" even resembles
    a bouncier D12!</p><p>
    
    I really hope that I'm wrong about all of this.  I hope that what I'm hearing on this album's just
    growing pains-- the transition from the private to the public and the self-consciousness and
    uncertainty that goes along with that. I still have much love for Atmosphere and will be quick to
    pick up their next effort.  They have mad talent, no doubt.  And although I'm sure that <i>God Loves
    Ugly</i> will be their best-selling album (maybe even allowing them The Big Crossover), artistically
    speaking, this is Atmosphere at its damndest.</p></div>"|341.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/341-god-loves-ugly/|5.7|Sam Chennault

    with; confronted by America and Sweden's two-front onslaught, I think they're finally cracking.  Case
    in point: the British music critics who're calling the Yeah Yeah Yeahs ""the next big thing.""  Get in line,
    you say.  The press is drooling over the band's U.K. tour, and succumbing most of all to singer Karen
    O, a self-described female Iggy Pop whose nutty performances and beer-soaked minidresses have won over
    everyone from <em>NME</em> to John Peel.  The band doesn't play the States again for a couple of weeks, so
    all I have to go on is this debut EP, and even that's only thirteen minutes long.  I don't know what kind
    of an impression these kids can make in that time, but I settle in, get comfortable, jack up the volume,
    and give it a whirl.</p><p>
    The opening track, ""Bang!,"" sure sounds like the real deal.  Nick Zinner's ultra-raunch electric guitar
    kicks off the riff while Karen O whispers, ""The bigger... the better.""  It's catchy, and sure enough, it's
    sexy.  Credit goes to Boss Hog's Jerry Teel for recording this to sound like it's playing out of a $39
    boombox on a stripper's windowsill: whether he meant to or just had to, he nailed the sound of a hard-working
    band with no cash.  O's vocals sound like 5% inspiration and 95% perspiration, but there's nothing wrong
    with that; if the singing were flat we'd have a problem, but O works every single syllable of the lyrics,
    taunting, dodging and oozing across the song.  The ""aw aw aw hey yeah"" adlibbing says way more than the words.</p><p>
    Brian Chase bangs open the next song, ""Mystery Girl,"" with primal drumbeats under Karen O's teasy squeals.
    This is b-movie rock with lyrics about every drive-in cliché they could find: ""They found her under the sea/
    She said she came from cell block 3! [squeal]""  I don't have a photo of O in front of me but an image is
    coming to me: she's leaning against a convertible, in a denim miniskirt and cowboy boots, and there's hot,
    hot steam radiating from the car.  She tells me she has a problem with her trunk, and I tell her I can
    help out.  I'm reaching for my tool--
    </p><p>
    --and what the fuck is a Cake song doing on here?  Listen to the phrasing on the first line of ""Art Star""!
    A total knock-off of John McCrea's monotonous sing/speaking! And that's not even mentioning the ""do do do
    do do da do da do"" melody.  This is poppy enough, and they fuse it with bursts of noise and diaphragm-ripping
    shouts, but it seems out of place.  O uses the song to play the part of a celebrated New York artist with a
    ""madhouse"" life.  It's a persona, but the whole album sounds like a role-playing exercise anyway.  When they
    expand to a full-length O might take this farther, in the mode of PJ Harvey or a garage-rocking Tori Amos,
    perhaps-- maybe she could sing each song as a different character, like a randy widow, a teen harlot, and a
    rock 'n' roll nun.  But for now, could we just have the woman from that last song again?
    </p>
<p>
    And then we hit paydirt.  ""Miles Away"" opens with the guitar strumming menacingly while O's voice twangs
    like every bad girl kicked out of a po' white high school.  ""You wonder... you wonder... you woondddeerrrrrrr.
    PANT PANT PANT PANT.""  When they hit the chorus, Zinner explodes like a small town muscle car rally, O
    screaming ferociously in an attempt to drown him out.  There's no teasing or artifice now, she's wailing
    like a twanging banshee.  Here comes the ferocious climax... and I'm spent.
    </p>
<p>
    I'm so satisfied, in fact, that I let the ultimate high school burn-out anthem, ""Our Time,"" just drift by:
    ""It's our year to be hated,"" she belts on the chorus atop shimmering guitars.  Time for the ugly kids to
    slow-dance.  Zinner hands out some more of those ten-story chords, and the switch from rock to pop starts
    to make sense.  For such a short debut, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have put together a pretty sharp survey of their
    capabilities.  This isn't a record, it's a portfolio: it's noisy but catchy, it lets them try out different
    styles, and it makes you give a good goddamn.  And I don't know who Karen O really is, but I think I know
    what she <em>wants</em> me to think.  I'm intrigued.

    As such, it's summer, and you need a good metal album.  <i>Jane Doe</i> wasn't released this year, but
    sometimes you've got to pay dues when they're owed.  And Converge might not exactly be heavy metal, either.
    They got their start in their hometown of Boston in the early nineties, playing covers of their favorite
    punk and hardcore songs.  The blistering fusion unit they've evolved into has been called many things--
    hardcore metal, math metal, metalcore-- but they could be ultra-core for all I care.  Let's ignore the
    niceties.  Converge is a smart, aggressive, brutal quintet, and <i>Jane Doe</i> will kick your ass
    repeatedly until it leaves its long imprint in your flabby buttflesh.</p><p>
    
    The album opens in a throttling surge of bass and drums courtesy of ""Concubine.""  If you're not familiar with
    this kind of music you might be blown back by the apocalyptic screech of frontman Jacob Bannon's vocals.  It's
    clear with each gritty blast that the guy is screaming out his lungs for you.  Naturally, you can't follow a
    single word but the vox bleed into the furious guitars and it's all acidic corrosion.  With the emphasis
    lately on Fennesz and the pixilated laptop set, it's easy to forget that there's whole realms of sound to
    be found in the lethal decay of metal guitar's radioactive isotopes.  In less than a minute-and-a-half, this
    song churns from a murderously fast-paced midsection to a slow stomp and back to a breakneck pace.</p><p>
    
    ""Fault and Fracture"" picks up seamlessly where the last left off.  Once again, the instruments lose their
    origins, blending in sonic onslaught.  Ben Koller's harsh yet amazingly nuanced drumming ties it all together,
    and the one standout are these hilarious metal trills that peal out from the guitar.  Until you reach
    ""Distance and Meaning,"" it's not clear where the hardcore influence lies.  The band slows the pace just
    enough so you can understand Bannon snarling, ""That's where they die, that's where they suicide,"" amongst
    the lines wrought by the wiry rhythm.  <i>Jane Doe</i> weaves different weights of heavy music together
    like this, careful to keep the listener interested.</p><p>
    
    As the album moves on, you realize that Converge aren't just showing off their impressive stylistic range;
    they're telling a story.  ""Homewrecker"" reaches an awesome peak as Bannon's ""No love! No hope!"" chorus
    transmutes to a howl so searing that even veteran scenehounds will be looking for a pit to flail around in.
    But it's during the tug-of-war vocal trades on ""The Broken Vow"" that the tale solidifies, one of missed
    phone calls, old bridges being burned, and lost love.  The narrative builds up again and climaxes with
    ""Phoenix in Flight,"" which begins as a mournful dirge but soon sweeps up through a series of blazing guitar
    lines that make the elegy even more powerful.  You get the sense that the mysterious female mentioned in the
    lyrics reaches apotheosis with ""Phoenix in Flames,"" an absolute cataclysm of noise that sounds like contact
    mics were stuffed in a bass drum and tossed down the side of a mountain.</p><p>
    
    At the end you think back, scratch your head and wonder what the hell it was you listened to.  Ultimately,
    Converge resists easy taxonomy; they're not going to play into that guy's game of ""Who's Metal?""  As it is,
    the artwork is strangely concerned with women.  A series of faces arise out of stippled dots, all black-ringed
    eyes and pouty lips vamping from behind the cover of lyric text printed across the page.  Is the message
    that this woman is just like any other, now that she's lost to him?  The archetype is unsettling, but no
    more so than applauding as success the picture of a woman removing her burqa in a country still overrun by
    thugs and warlords.  At least anonymity won't curse Converge for long with an album like this so full of
    intelligence, skill and intensity that it's simply masterful.  Otherwise, I don't know what to call it.
    That's probably a good thing.</p></div>"|1594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1594-jane-doe/|7.7|Christopher Dare

After years off the Boston rock scene, he's
    jumped back in as if he was never gone.  First he plays a handful of raved-about reunion shows with Mission
    of Burma-- the most famous out of a legion of great rock and pop bands that played Boston in the 80s.  Now
    he's got his own project, Consonant, whose debut album has just been released.  There's nothing wildly new
    or innovative about the band, and nothing unfamiliar about the music; it's just an extremely likeable
    power-pop band playing a bunch of great songs.</p><p>
    With Burma, Conley played bass and wrote some of their best songs, including ""That's When I Reach for My
    Revolver.""  As Eric Van of Boston rock rag The Noise reports, Conley kept writing for a while, and then
    stopped until recently; this album includes both post-Burma songs and brand new ones.  When he decided to
    record them, he worked with Holly Anderson to turn her poetry into the lyrics, and lined up an indie all-star
    band featuring Chris Brokaw of Come and Winston Braman of Fuzzy, plus Matt Kadane of Bedhead and Silkworm on
    drums.</p><p>
    Consonant is more accessible than Mission of Burma, and less jittery and abrasive. It veers towards power-pop,
    though it's usually more propulsive than jangly.  It sounds as if it was recorded in a worn-out Allston
    rehearsal space, which gives the band room for their rough edges and loose professionalism.  The opener,
    ""Blissful,"" immediately grabs you with a slick hook and ebullient drumming.  From there, the moods switch
    from dirges like ""Call it L---,"" to soaring pop like ""What a Body Could Do"" (which cribs from a song by the
    Busted Statues). ""Details of Attraction"" has precious overtones and almost folky, fragile vocals; like most
    of Anderson's lyrics, the words can be lined up to spell out the names of flowers, which admittedly ain't
    too rock.  But ""The Kiss""-- and ""John Coltrane's 'My Favorite Things'""-- blare full bore on top of Conley's
    and Brokaw's guitars.</p><p>
    Anderson's and Conley's lyrics are full of fumbling sexuality and vulnerable moments.  Aside from a few
    misfires (the ""Love, glove, moon, June"" line in the song ""Post-Pathetic""), they're a perfect match for the
    vocals.  High and a little thin, Conley's isn't the most assertive rock voice, but the songs turn that into
    a strength: for example, the shouted grind of ""Buckets of Flowers, Porno Mags,"" or the amused frustration on
    ""Post-Pathetic.""  And he sounds genuinely unguarded on the slower numbers-- for example, on ""Not Like Them.""</p><p>
    One of the stand-outs, ""What a Body Could Do,"" has lyrics about teenagers learning to mess around with each
    other.  It's as blaring and tensely excited as the adolescent sexuality that these guys should have forgotten
    years ago.  When the song drifts into a quiet bridge, you can see from a mile away that the band's about to
    come crashing back, rocking harder than ever.  It's the biggest cliché in the lexicon, but when it happens,
    it's like nobody's ever done it before: you have to crank up the volume and pound on the dashboard.</p><p>
    Maybe it's the spontaneity of the playing, or the honesty of a mature and experienced man who can still talk
    about fumbling around and figuring things out.  Or maybe it's the excitement Conley projects from getting
    back in a band and realizing he's as talented as ever.  Consonant's debut sounds fresh even though it's
    steeped in years of indie rock and, best of all, Boston rock.  It could be my hometown prejudice, but this
    is one of the most flat-out enjoyable albums I've heard this year.</p></div>"|1587.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1587-consonant/|8.2|Chris Dahlen

    listeners the bands of Domino Records subsidiary Geographic, a vanity label of sorts curated by those ambassadors of twee, the Pastels.
    It was commissioned by the Japan's Trattoria, the vanity label of Cornelius.  And if that isn't enough vanity
    for you, check this out: the Pastels saw fit to hand themselves the first two slots on this comp. How generous!</p><p>
    
    Somehow (we'll call it fate), this comp missed Japan entirely and ended up on my desk. And while my life
    hasn't been changed by it, it does contain a number of redeeming qualities. The songs gathered here, with
    a few exceptions, are exclusive to this release, and I imagine most people who would consider buying this
    are either Kevin Shields completists (I've been told they still exist) or diehard fans of pasty Scottish
    indie rock. As for the first count, all I can say is don't bother. The Shields track that ends this
    collection, ""Outro,"" is by far the most worthless and unmemorable moment here: a very unremarkable
    interpretation/remix of the Pastels' song that opens the disc, ""Intro,"" which was fairly unremarkable to
    begin with.  But I guess if you're a completist, by definition, this little tip won't make much difference.
    Sucker.</p><p>
    
    As for the other contribution from the Pastels, it's a cover of Sly Stone's ""Everybody Is a Star"" (the
    compilation's title is culled from one of its lines). And if you've ever wanted to hear a decent song
    drained of its lifeblood and anaesthetized into oblivion, here's your chance. Me, after forcing myself
    through it a few times for the sake of reference, I now skip directly to track three, which is a ramshackle
    pop tune from Glasgow's International Airport called ""Cordial Arrest.""  Frontman Tom Crossley (himself a
    member of the Pastels, as well as Appendix Out) has a voice like a less gruff and more tuneful Damien Jurado,
    and the music sounds a lot like the early work of fellow Scots Belle &amp; Sebastian. Must be something in the
    ale.</p><p>
    
    Future Pilot AKA follows, offering up a fun, if somewhat cold, reggae chant with pling-plong beats, bells,
    and a tad bit of scratching (turntables or guitar strings, I'm not completely sure). Bill Wells Octet
    continues in the goofy (yet, again cold, ironic, and distant) vein with a jazzy, happy-go-lucky, whistle-led
    instrumental that sounds like it comes from a Sesame Street skit-- you know, the one where the kid is walking
    in the rain, skipping mud puddles, wearing a bright yellow raincoat and shiny red galoshes.</p><p>
    
    Two Japanese bands come next (giving the Japanese listener a sense that Geographic really cares, I assume):
    the quixotic Zappa-esque Maher Shalal Hash Baz and Japan's resident Neil-Young-o-philes, Nagisa Ni Te. I've
    never heard the music of Maher Shalal Hash Baz before, and to be honest, after hearing their ""Stone In the
    River,"" I'm not exactly rushing over to Forced Exposure to catch up with them: boring, and with an annoying
    affected weirdness to it, like Zappa at his worst. Nagisa Ni Te's effort, on the other hand, is something
    that would get me interested in their music had I not heard it before. As it is though, I have. ""Me On the
    Beach"" is a re-recording of a song from their excellent <i>On the Love Beach</i> album. The song begins with
    <i>Harvest</i>-like acoustic guitar and harmonica, and ends with a blast of feedback echoing <i>Rust Never
    Sleeps</i>. Yet the band's dual male/female vocals (and, well, the fact that they're Japanese) helps rescue
    them from the ranks of banal American imitators.</p><p>
    
    The mid-section of this comp is where things begin to really drag, though, with a handful of uneventful and
    interchangeable electronic instrumentals, an almost stereotypical German techno number, and an obligatory
    half-assed Low imitation.  On the plus side, there is a excellent Appendix Out song. ""The Language of Things,""
    while kinda wordy and didactic, is beautifully expressed through Ali Roberts' creeky chords and one-of-a-kind
    moan. He is the Scottish Will Oldham. Or maybe Oldham is the American Ali Roberts. You get my point. Both
    call upon the spectre of history through their updated folk without crumbling under the oppressive weight of
    the past. And speaking of Will Oldham, wasn't ""No More Rides"" a Palace song? Well, it sounds like it. Either
    way, National Park has a song here by that name and it's good. Not as frazzled or unpredictable as the Bonnie
    Prince, but getting down to a pretty bleak vibe through a similar route all the same.</p><p>
    
    If I could use one word to sum up this comp it would be 'chilly.' Sometimes austerity is used for some
    greater good, but elsewhere its sole purpose is to leave an arty gloss upon everything. <i>You Don't Need
    Darkness</i> left me feeling like I'd just watched a particularly bleak European (maybe Scandinavian) film:
    while it peered honestly into some dark corners and a faint glimmer of truth was told, its primary purpose
    seemed to be to leave you feeling cold about yourself and the universe around you.</p></div>"|1896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1896-you-dont-need-darkness-to-do-what-you-think-is-right/|6.0|Jason Nickey

Maybe you've heard of 'em.  Back in 2000, they released a fine,
    upstanding debut called <i>Automatic Midnight</i>.  Wasn't nothin' groundbreaking, but it spared no man
    caught standing in its crosshairs, filling mop-topped hipsters countrywide with bullets of mercurial death.
    It didn't concern itself with paltry academic nonsense like <i>innovation</i> and <i>progression</i>.
    Hell no!  It came for one purpose and one purpose only: to bludgeon.  And now the Snakes come again,
    slithering diligently between the feet of still-standing concertgoers, sensing the sweat of unshowered
    ankles, arching their backs, preparing to strike.  These are the snakes you fear most: the kind that bite.</p><p>
    
    Combining the angular lashings of Drive Like Jehu with the strut and bravado of Rocket from the Crypt and
    a healthy dose of pure menace, the Snakes have assembled a sound straight from the heart of rock itself.
    You won't find them toppling the tower of convention to its very foundation, or even shaking their fists
    at it, and if this sound ever seems familiar or predictable, it's only because you've <i>remembered
    it from your immortal soul</i>.  (Plato, next round's on me.)  These guys capture the essential, timeless
    threat of rock music with every track they lay down.  And damn straight-- the raw, naked aggression that
    pours out the speakers is intimidating.  That's beauty of it.  Hot Snakes aren't putting themselves out
    there to push rock music to another plane; they're thrilled just to refine it through a series of lean,
    caustic numbers full of bared-to-the-bones malice and spite, punctuated by occasional moments of subtle,
    perceived vulnerability.</p><p>
    
    It's clear from the get-go that there's danger lurking just beneath the surface of this music, and if given
    the chance, it'll chew you up and shit you out.  The jagged, stutter-stepping guitars of John Reis and Rick
    Froberg (RFTC frontman, ex-Drive Like Jehu, respectively) skip the ears and drill straight through the skull.
    Steve Albini would be so proud of the heavy metallic rumblings produced by Gar Wood's bass guitar, and Jason
    Kourkounis simply shreds his skins.  Together, these men create a musical backdrop that's hard as gaw-damn
    nails and not afraid to repeat itself until you understand exactly where it's coming from.</p><p>
    
    Froberg's vocal tone is the perfect emotional center of each and every one of <i>Suicide Invoice</i>'s
    twelve tracks.  Most of the time, he sounds like he's trying with all his might just to make it to the
    surface of the mix, like he's calling out across a vast distance.  His desperation adds essential emotional
    impact to what would otherwise seem to be quite obvious subject matter, giving it a truly convincing edge.
    And once in a while, on songs like ""Why Does It Hurt"" and ""Paperwork,"" Froberg drops the rage almost entirely,
    and all that's left for lines like ""I know your heart is in the right place/ So why does it hurt?"" is the
    sound of alienation.  It doesn't happen much, but when it does it's damn powerful, and not for a second
    undignified.</p><p>
    
    Otherwise, tracks like ""I Hate the Kids"" (""Grab a spade, get in the dirt/ The older you get, the less you're
    worth"") and ""Paid in Cigarettes"" are callous and cruel enough to punch you in the stomach and steal your
    lunch money.  The only tropes these guys know are 'kicking ass' and 'taking names,' and the rest can go to

    comes from its own world. There is no material reference point for something
    like Oval's <i>Szenariodisk</i> or Autechre's <i>EP7</i>. No object and no
    living thing can make these sounds; they are instead birthed from the
    unknowable guts of a cold, calculating machine. It is these limitless
    sonic possibilities that have driven composers to electronic music since
    before John Cage was calling his early experiments ""Imaginary Landscapes.""</p><p>
    
    But there's also something to be said for electronic music that remains
    grounded, emotionally accessible, and clearly of this earth. And it's in
    this class of electronic records that Twine's <i>Recorder</i> falls. Rather
    than sounding like the outgrowth of endless experiment, <i>Recorder</i> sounds
    like it was laid out carefully before the first mouse had been clicked, the
    whole thing designed to realize very specific musical goals. This is no pile-up
    of exhaustively rendered Max/MSP patches. Despite the fact that the album is
    composed on computer, <i>Recorder</i> sounds orchestral, with dense layers of
    sound reverberating in a defined space. It's the anything-goes spirit of
    abstract IDM applied to sweeping dramatic gestures, a laptop version of the
    soundtrack to <i>Apocalypse Now</i>. And at this moment in the music's
    development, it sounds refreshing.</p><p>
    
    Strummed electric guitar is the first sound heard on ""None Some Silver,""
    setting a dark emotional tone that <i>Recorder</i> beautifully sustains.
    The chords are distantly spaghetti western, but the menace and tension
    behind them feel like more than just a cinematic homage, possibly aided
    by the electronic noise that bubbles beneath. Eventually, the synthetic
    whine envelops the track completely, subsuming the familiar instrument in
    a cloud of harsh noise. The following ""Cign"" begins with a whistling tone
    that leads to tribal beats that ping-pong between the speakers, rising and
    falling along with the restless drones behind the beats. This track
    showcases the electronic/organic nature of <i>Recorder</i>, as the
    percussion, so clearly synthetic, conversely seems beaten out by a drum
    corps. The feeling of dread conveyed by ""Cign"" is incredibly vivid.</p><p>
    
    A much slower emotional burn is evident on ""Fine Music."" Here, Twine seem
    to be coming from a place similar to Stars of the Lid circa <i>The Ballasted
    Orchestra</i>, combined with Labradford's respect for the power of a stalking
    bass drum. ""Curved"" is another drone piece in a similar vein, but the
    elongated tones are a bit less dreary, and are constantly being interrupted
    by percussive whooshes of sound that sound like they're caroming off the
    walls of a cavern. While maintaining a similar atmosphere, ""Player Piano""
    delves into collage, with randomly chopped piano notes that fall into place
    in a pretty melody bumping against sampled voice, odd instrumental snippets
    and assorted clicks and pops.</p><p>
    
    None of the raw material on <i>Recorder</i> is particularly new, and there's
    nothing to convey on paper what makes this record so good. It simply achieves
    exactly what it set out to: 56 minutes of carefully assembled texture meant
    to convey feelings of loneliness, isolation, fear and tension.  It's dark
    electronic music sticky with human fingerprints.</p></div>"|8217.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8217-recorder/|8.0|Mark Richard-San

    Queen recently dispensed knighthoods.  Whether as a member of uber-DJ crew the Beat Junkies or with his
    more recent stint as resident DJ of the nearly crossed-over Dilated Peoples, his Zen-like demeanor has been
    a fixture in the underground hip-hop scene for nearly a decade. His landmark DJ mixtape, <i>Beat Junkies
    Vol. 1</i>, and break record, <i>Super Duck Breaks</i>, were blueprints for turntablists from the Bay Area
    to Tokyo.  In fact, the man not only perfected turntablism, he coined the term.</p><p>
    For better or worse, hip-hop never sleeps, and many of the tricks and techniques that seemed superhuman and
    revolutionary three years ago sound passé and redundant today.  But you have to hand it to Babu; he realized
    that he could no longer dazzle the underground masses with a 60-minute marathon of lightning crab scratches
    and juggling gymnastics.  Instead, he uses <i>Duck Season</i> as a song showcase and adopts the party mixtape
    vibe that his peers (e.g., Peanut Butter Wolf, the Triple Threat DJs, and fellow Beat Junkie J-Rocc) have
    recently championed.  Unfortunately, while the aforementioned DJs have redefined themselves as vinyl
    archeologists by sprinkling their playlists with obscure hip-hop and R&amp;B; tracks, Babu relies upon a roster
    of artists for <i>Duck Season</i> that are generally too dated to be considered relevant, yet too young to
    be considered classic.  But don't get it twisted-- while this album shows signs that Babu's days as a
    turntablist/hip-hop innovator may be behind him, he can still put together a collection of scorching jams.</p><p>
    For one thing, the beats on this album bump harder than an East Flatbush block party, and while the lyrics
    do generally rely upon the one-line braggadocio theatrics that have threatened to strangle hip-hop lyricism,
    they complement the album's late-night, club-bangin' vibe nicely.  The album kicks off with De La Soul's
    ""Watch Out,"" recycled from last year's <i>AOI: Bionix</i>. While I've heard that this is one of the album's
    better tracks, I haven't been able to listen to De La since they blew up and went pop on their shameful
    collaboration with boy band LFO.   Next up is L.A.'s finest, Phil Da Agony, on ""Kronkite.""  For this track,
    Babu unleashes the full force of his awesome turntablist skills, juggling Phil's vocal intro before dropping
    the track's thunderous and ominously pimping beat.</p><p>
    The mix loses some momentum with Major's ""Concrete N*igga"" and Bumpy Knuckle's ""Patch Up the Pieces,"" but
    fortunately picks back up with the M.O.P. track ""Follow Instructions,"" an ammo-drilled anthem that boasts
    typically sick production by the legendary (if a bit overextended) DJ Premier.  Soul Brother #1 Pete Rock
    keeps things moving with ""Cake."" Although this track falls short of his classic early-90s material with C.L.
    Smooth, how could anyone be expected to duplicate the simple street soul of ""T.R.O.Y.""?</p><p>
    After the Pete Rock song, the album shifts gears and moves from the east coast to the west with mixed results.
    While Defari's ""Behold My Life"" is perhaps the finest Babu-produced track on the album, the Kankick and the
    Visionaries sound stale on ""Sight for Sour Eyes."" The Quasimoto remix adds nothing to the original (although
    it certainly never hurts to have Lord Quas on a mixtape), but the Souls of Mischief/Dilated Peoples
    collaboration is nice.</p><p>
<i>Duck Season</i>'s last two tracks almost make it a classic.  Legendary old-school MC Big Daddy Kane may
    have exchanged his trademark flattop for an afro, but his '89-style flow remains as raucous and authoritative
    as ever on the Alchemist-produced ""The Man/The Icon.""  The gem of the whole collection, though, has gotta be
    Jurassic 5's politically charged ""Ducky Boy.""  What makes the song so refreshing is that Jurassic 5, who with
    their endless harmonizing and soft beats have long sounded like Freestyle Fellowship lite, seem to be making
    a conscientious attempt to challenge both their sound and their audience's expectations. The beat is heavier
    and less backpacker bouncy than usual, and the first line-- ""I've never been hesitant to say fuck the
    president""-- immediately sets the song's confrontational tone.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the energy and willingness to expand that distinguishes the Jurassic 5 track is missing from
    the rest of the disc.  <i>Duck Season</i> lacks the vitality of the earlier Beat Junkies releases because it
    not only refuses to deviate from an admittedly successful formula, but it also doesn't even attempt to stay
    fresh by bringing some new blood into the fold-- which is both depressing and boring.  The album also suffers
    from the same identity crisis as the Automator's <i>Wanna Buy a Monkey</i>: it seems stuck somewhere between
    a mixtape and a production showcase.  The mixes between songs are generally weak, and Babu rarely attempts
    to even match his beats up.  While there are definitely some hot songs on here, <i>Duck Season</i> just
    doesn't compare to other Beat Junkies mixtapes-- which had both fresh songs and hot mixes.  So that leaves
    <i>Duck Season</i> in merely adequate territory. If you want the real Beat Junkie flavor, my suggestion
    would be to pick up J-Rocc's <i>Sex Machine</i> or Beat Junkies' <i>Vol. 1-3</i>.</p></div>"|511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/511-duck-season/|7.1|Sam Chennault

It's not as if the kind of music I usually write
    about for Pitchfork is much more coherent than Japan's Mong Hang, but at
    least it's usually less frustrating.  The music here is not so much impressive
    as it is calculatedly eclectic and raw.  Of course, I've come to expect
    progressive rock flourishes and heavy-handed virtuosity from bands of this
    sort, and the celebrity connections are right on time (drummer Atsushi Tanaka
    has played with Acid Mothers Temple).  And just as the worst thing you can say
    of the Acid Mothers is that they sound like the a thousand other psychedelic
    jam bands, but juiced up on steroids, Mong Hang, at their worst, merely sound
    like a second rate Acid Mothers or one of many Tatsuya Yoshida projects.
    That's a shame because at their best, they're a good poor man's symphonic
    prog band-- something like Gentle Giant being forced to use Tom Waits'
    instruments and Gary Wilson's budget.</p><p>
    
    I'll start with the good stuff: the opener, ""Bi,"" begins with some
    broken-English emceeing and a boisterous tympani roll which bursts into
    good old fashioned pomp-rock fanfare, not unlike what Queen thrust on the
    world before they got rich.  The drums are loud and distorted, pounding out
    entire orchestral percussion parts, and the vocals are pure operatic
    shout-song.  It's probably as bombastic as they could muster, but since I
    doubt their advance could cover Roy Thomas Baker's shoe polish, the
    overwhelming effect is fairly quaint.  ""Orange Seximo"" is the first of a
    few tunes to feature Mong Hang's secret weapon: the steel drums.
    Percussionist Yohei Bohemian plays a melody on them that sounds close to
    traditional Japanese, and background vocalists 'la-la' their way through
    some nice helium-voiced counterpoint.  About midway through, the guitars
    crash in, and Mong Hang becomes Ruins, Jr., but the brief acoustic does
    offer a glimpse into the startling refined musicianship on display.</p><p>
    
    Bassist Keitaimo Wuja Bin Bin wrote most of the music here.  I haven't seen
    his name around anywhere else, but from what I gather, beyond the usual
    avant-prog-psyche elements, he seems to have a preference for epic concepts.
    Many of the tunes share motives, bringing back a familiar melody here or a
    hard groove there.  Of course, this is old hat for proggers, but Mong Hang's
    greatest accomplishment appears to have been making their music seem a lot
    more simple than it actually is.  ""Mangcha"" brings out Waits' marimba and
    drunken waltz beat, almost fooling me into thinking they'd go for the
    bizarro pomp again, but soon enough, the helium vocals are back, and son of
    junior Ruins makes an appearance.  And then they break into a Santana-style
    Latin rock solo section.  They sound like good enough players, but the
    overriding goofiness threatens to tumble all their hard work into a round of
    laffs.  This effectively kills momentum in legitimate prog symphonies like
    ""Mountains II: Harasu,"" and might keep folks from staying tuned until the
    last tune, ""Gommos,"" a ruggedly pretty traditional Japanese ballad.</p><p>
    
    The absolute worst?  Try ""Mesopotamia,"" wherein Mong Hang attempts to
    transcend third-rate cartoon music by injecting fake kids' vocals and a
    limp polka beat.  If that doesn't sway you, then try ""Sap Alan on the Tellial,""
    which may actually the best thing to ever repeat the same grating line of
    verse 100 times and feature Elmo on lead vocals.  The otherworldly
    percussion coda comes too late to save me from TV Land psychosis.  But as much
    as I'd like to ignore tunes like that, I'm afraid they're only symptoms of a
    greater call to clowning that draws the band.  You can be sure they tear it
    up live, and parts of this album have doubtlessly planted the seed of
    curiosity in my head enough to at least download whatever they come up with
    next.  Here's hoping it's more jam and less ham.</p></div>"|5396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5396-mong-hang/|6.6|Dominique Leone

    1. an editor<br/>
    2. a band<br/>
    3. one of those golf-tee brainteaser peg games from the Cracker Barrel<br/>
    4. an electric guitar</p><p>
    
    Of course, a real Darnielle fanatic would find most of these suggestions
    to be downright heretical.  With a veritable mountain of cassette tapes
    and compact discs, the California nurse/rock critic has carved himself a
    distinct sound; one of hard-strummed acoustics, nonexistent recording budgets,
    and razor-keen lyricism.  While this approach continues to exhibit strong
    vital signs-- this year's <i>All Hail West Texas</i> served as one of his
    best records yet-- I can't help but speculate at the potential of a more
    fleshed-out sound.  Chalk it up to the 'Stick With What Works' vs. 'Explore
    New Directions' dilemma that confronts any artist stable enough to find
    their way beyond album #3.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, along come the Extra Glenns to test my hypothesis that Darnielle's
    eccentricities would survive, and maybe even be enhanced by, additional
    musicians and instruments.  The setup: a collaboration with Franklin Bruno
    of Nothing Painted Blue, who contributes piano, backing vocals, and one of
    those newfangled guitars that plug into an amplifier.  A full band it's not;
    there are still no drums, bass, or gospel-trained backup singers.  But it's
    a step in the direction of appeasing my curiosity.</p><p>
    
    Too bad <i>Martial Arts Weekend</i> leaves out my favorite member of the
    Mountain Goats team, the Panasonic RX-FT500 boombox that gives the bulk of
    Darnielle's discography that wonderfully no-fi, transistor radio character.
    Recorded on actual functioning equipment, <i>Martial Arts Weekend</i> has
    none of the tape hiss and EQ-red-zone distortion that fills in the empty
    space around Darnielle's solo jobs.  And since Bruno prefers to use a light,
    shimmery guitar tone that provides little in the way of low-end, everything
    has the skinny, half-finished sound of your favorite 80s records (when treble
    was king).</p><p>
    
    As a result, a dozen typical, but strong Darnielle compositions (plus one
    absolutely unbearable Leonard Cohen cover) are brought down by an
    over-abundance of empty sonic real estate and a shared songwriting byline.
    To his credit, Bruno's embellishments are kept simple enough to not be
    distracting, and they manage to add a little extra flavor to back catalog
    echo songs like ""Baltimore"" or ""Malevolent Seascape Y.""  But then again,
    neither his six-string or ivory-tinkling work is particularly revelatory--
    nothing he plays jumps out as being so essential that a track might collapse
    without it.  The real culprit here could actually be Darnielle, whose parts
    already sound fully realized without Bruno's flourishes, which lends the
    project a largely inorganic feel like that of Robert Pollard's recent
    tapes-by-mail experiments.</p><p>
    
    Still, I'd be lying if I said there weren't enjoyable moments to be had.
    While the album doesn't have the consistency of recent Mountain Goats LPs,
    it hits as often as early albums like <i>Zopilote Machine</i> and <i>Nine
    Black Poppies</i>.  Bruno adds a mournful harmonica to the jaunty ""Somebody
    Else's Parking Lot in Sebastapol"" and comes up with a neat complementary
    riff and jazzy piano solo to soup up ""Twelve Hands High.""  Meanwhile, Darnielle
    calls upon all his tried-and-true lyrical themes: flora, geography, and
    acrobatic mentions of historical figures like Verdi and Kierkegaard.  Especially
    nice is the 'road-trip-battle-over-car-stereo-privileges-as-metaphor-for-decaying-relationship'
    in ""Going to Michigan,"" and the love-is-harder-to-kill-than-Freddy-Kreuger track
    ""Going to Marrakesh"" (choice line: ""Our love is like Jesus/ But worse"").</p><p>
    
    But after the initial novelty of hearing more than your average instrumentation
    beneath Darnielle's literate whine, <i>Martial Arts Weekend</i> comes off as a
    semi-pleasing but second-tier Mountain Goats effort.  And as a test of my 'try
    it with a band' theory, the results are strictly inconclusive-- after all, only
    one of my four birthday gifts really turn up full-fledged.  At least I won't have
    to take back that Cracker Barrel golf-tee game.</p></div>"|2884.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2884-martial-arts-weekend/|6.7|Rob Mitchum

    [they] say"" when questioning the moral authority of America.  Mr. Lif, who professes that ""my eyes are wide
    open 'cause my television is off,"" has been one of the more socially conscious emcees on the recent scene,
    but with <i>Emergency Rations</i>, an EP released last month, he's crafted his most overtly political work
    to date, and the most inflammatory album of the post-9/11 era.</p><p>
    
    That's not to say that hip-hop artists haven't addressed this country's current political climate. Sage
    Francis' <i>Makeshift Patriot</i> and J-Live's <i>Satisfied</i> both did a wonderful job of addressing
    their respective misgivings of America's revised nationalism. But while the aforementioned songs express
    only vague reassurances of continued political consciousness, <i>Emergency Rations</i> is a straight-up,
    name-calling, policy-specific work of dissent.  Think Noam Chomsky with a beat.</p><p>
    
    Brother PC and frequent Lif collaborator Akrobatik kick off the album with a skit about the apparent
    abduction of Lif by government agents determined to stifle his free speech rights.  It's an unfortunate
    and sophomoric concept that's referenced both in the liner notes and on brief skits between songs.  But
    on the dancehall scorcher, ""Jugular Vein,"" Lif leaves the silliness behind as he takes the mic and sets
    shit off properly.  The beat is infectious and Lif's observational randomness and aggressive, plainspoken
    vocal delivery recall both Guru and Rakim.  While the slashing cadence can be a bit repetitive over the
    course of the album, there's a smoothness in his flow, and an intelligence and wit in his observations that
    rescue him from mundanity.</p><p>
    
    ""Home of the Brave"" is the most politically direct and thematically focused song on the album. On the
    track's second verse, Lif gives us his polemical take on the hype following 9/11: ""When they realized we
    didn't support their attacks, they needed something to distract: Anthrax/ So America's chant while we kill
    innocent families.../ Here's what the history books won't show, you're a dead man for fucking with American
    dough."" Finally, Lif concludes that ""they killed us because we've been killing them for years."" Lif debuted
    the song earlier this year at a club less than a dozen blocks from the WTC site-- an act of American courage
    that isn't likely to be heralded by George Bush or William Safire.</p><p>
    
    Although the sentiments are uncompromisingly confrontational and radically political, there's something about
    both Lif's tone and his flow that don't exude the hard-boiled rage of Chuck D.  In his own words, he keeps
    things on ""a positive tip,"" and his rants are generally more informative and instructive than they are
    inflammatory and zealous.  On ""Pull Out Your Cut,"" Lif even addresses the cultural forces that create eating
    disorders in girls and dictate ""that boys should never cry""-- both topics that I'm pretty sure have never
    been addressed in hip-hop. The song is astute, kinda quirky and endearing, if not a bit lightweight for
    hip-hop-- which are all qualities that could describe Lif's persona in general.</p><p>
    
    This quirky charm is nicely complemented by the album's musical production, which features Lif, Eden, and
    El-P. With the exception of ""I, Phantom"" (which is El-P's single contribution), the entire album has either
    a laid-back dancehall reggae or old-school vibe that's a pleasant departure from the glitch-core futurism
    that generally distinguishes Def Jux artists.</p><p>
    
    At times, however, Lif's randomness becomes too much and entire songs spiral out of focus and come off
    like untouched freestyles.  On ""Pull Out Your Cut,"" Lif abandons his dissection of the media's pervading
    influence and goes off on a tangent about how much he likes GZA and Guru.  It's a fair enough opinion, but
    it's oddly placed and disrupts the song's consistency. And it must be said that nothing on this record
    demonstrates that Lif can place his political message in real social settings, e.g. The Coup's ""Kill Your
    Landlord"" or Public Enemy's ""9-1-1 Is a Joke.""</p><p>
    
    But minor flaws aside, Lif shows on this album that he's both topical and talented.  Although it lacks the
    revelatory, genre-melting impact of Cannibal Ox's <i>The Cold Vein</i> or El-P's <i>Fantastic Damage</i>,
    it stands on its own amongst the Def Jux heavyweights-- which is no small feat. If Lif can maintain his
    message over the course of an entire album and not be distracted by odd tangents, his forthcoming LP has
    the potential to be a classic that ranks alongside The Coup's <i>Steal This Album</i>.</p></div>"|5475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5475-emergency-rations-ep/|7.3|Sam Chennault

Try to imagine doing
    anything for that long-- say, grocery shopping, surfing the web or standing
    in line at the DMV.  To put it in perspective, that's more than 20 days: three
    whole weeks of your life.  To further qualify it, let's also mention that over
    the course of an entire lifetime, the average human spends just barely two
    cumulative weeks kissing-- about 336 hours.</p><p>
    
    According to sources, it took over 500 hours to record <i>Dekkagar</i>, the
    debut album from Chicago's National Trust.  Naturally, that's not 500 straight
    hours, but for a self-funded, independently released album, that's a lot of
    studio time.  In many ways, the time investment shows. <i>Dekkagar</i> is, to
    say the least, a lush, heavily layered album flooded with overdubs and elaborate
    arrangements.  And on a cursory listen, almost no one would guess that Brian
    Deck was mostly responsible for its smooth sound, as the resemblance to his
    other work with Califone, Red Red Meat, Modest Mouse, and any number of other
    Clava Studios projects is passing at best.</p><p>
    
    You can hear his clang-and-trash approach peeking through occasionally-- for
    instance, in the way the harmony vocals are recorded and layered, or in the odd
    analog tape noises that surface in the middle of the bongo-fueled ""Lachrymosa""--
    but by and large, he keeps his messier tendencies reined in out of respect for
    bandleader Neil Rosario's need for a smoother sound.  Rosario, formerly of
    Chicago blues-rockers Dolemite and, briefly, Red Red Meat, is said to have
    funded the recording of <i>Dekkagar</i> with money he won from gambling while
    visiting his dying father in Las Vegas-- though the honest thing for Rosario
    to do would've been to kick some of that back to The Impressions for his
    appropriation of their rough-hewn Chicago soul.  He could've tossed in a few
    greenbacks to Curtis Mayfield's estate, too, for traces of the old soul king's
    more progressive and elaborate solo work.</p><p>
    
    Rosario's debt to Mayfield manifests itself somewhat in his vocals, which
    frequently rise to a falsetto croon that unfortunately falls about halfway
    between Mayfield and Lambchop's Kurt Wagner-- it never reaches the majesty of
    the former, but also never grows as utterly tiresome as the latter's.  Of
    course, his voice is also rarely out there on its own.  I swear to god, there
    must be about 17 vocal tracks on some of these songs, and you've gotta wonder
    just what in the wide world of sports they were thinking spending hour-upon-hour
    layering dozens of vocal tracks when about five would have sufficed.</p><p>
    
    And therein lies the fundamental problem with <i>Dekkagar</i>: there's simply
    too damn much of it.  In a similar manner as Spiritualized's <i>Let It Come
    Down</i>, the arrangements sometimes simply overwhelm the proceedings and
    things become soupy instead of bracing.  And then there's the issue of
    length.  Every song here is well over four minutes, and some would definitely
    benefit from a bit of tasteful trimming.  Opener ""Making Love (In the Natural
    Light)"" opens with a steamy bit of hot-buttered indie soul that's frankly
    quite stunning, but by the time the <i>eleventh</i> minute rolls around,
    you're most likely somewhere else.  Similarly, ""Neverstop"" possesses an
    amazingly well-composed melody and an engaging progression you might expect
    to hear from a band on a label like Bobsled or Sealed Fate, but the hazy
    production and neverstopping length prevent it from ever being hammering home.</p><p>
    
    While it may work only fleetingly as a collection of songs, though, <i>Dekkagar</i>
    certainly works as a whole to create a mood.  The Rhodes piano that could have
    been lifted from an old Isaac Hayes acetate, the smoky bedtime bongos, clean
    wah-wah guitars and subdued, yet soulful vocals build atmosphere to spare,
    and under the right circumstances might even help you pad out those two weeks
    of kissing we're each allotted.  In the midst of his 70s soul fixation, Rosario
    also reveals an affinity for old-school Wall-of-Sound pop, a la Nitzche and
    Spector.  It surfaces most visibly on the floating harmonies that blanket closer
    ""First Time That,"" as a whole roomful of Rosarios glide through an ocean of
    reverb over a jazz-inflected rock groove.  It certainly stands as one of the
    prettiest things I've heard all year, even if it drifts on too long.</p><p>
    
    To reiterate: it took <i>500 hours</i> of several peoples' lives to make this
    record.  So I suppose now all that's left is for you to decide whether or not it
    sounds like it might be worth one hour of yours.  If you're looking for a
    revelation or something immediate, you'd best turn away, but if you just want
    something nice and mellow, take a chance.  Ultimately, I think Rosario and crew
    are capable of making something really amazing, but for now we have <i>Dekkagar</i>,
    an overambitious record from a band who may yet have Great Things in store,
    provided they can stop being so damn anal.</p></div>"|5723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5723-dekkagar/|6.9|Joe Tangari

Hey, that's understandable;
    they've kept a low profile stateside for years now, and have been hopping from label to label since their
    post-hiatus comeback, <i>The Tenement Year</i> saw release on Fontana in 1987.  But the truth is they
    never really went away. They've taken a few multi-year hiatuses, sure-- even gone through more line-up
    changes than the '87 Indians-- but they've been out there, hitting and missing with a slew of albums since
    the mid-70s.</p><p>
    
    And if you are haven't been keeping up with Cleveland's finest export since Roberto Alomar then it might
    surprise you to find out they're still pretty much on top of their game (which you can't say for Alomar).
    All 14 people who bought their '98 effort <i>Pennsylvania</i>, back me up on this.  I too was a Ubu-doubter,
    believing they'd faded into irrelevance around about 1983, but then I happened upon Griel Marcus' ""Best
    Albums of '98"" list and found <i>Pennsylvania</i> sitting pretty at #1.  I wanted to believe Marcus-- after
    all, I do stay up late into the night bent over my heavily worn copy of <i>Invisible Republic</i>, peering
    Kabala-like for eschatological insight and stock market tips, but I must say I was a tad skeptical.  Figured
    Marcus was just putting us on, trying to be difficult and outspoken. Still, the curiosity had me.</p><p>
    
    So after doing some recon, I located a copy of that record in a little shop just south Terre Haute, Indiana,
    and to my delight I found Marcus' estimation of the album to be pretty freaking accurate. ""Best album of 1998""
    is a ridiculous claim, but it's solid straight through and its hermetic vision of the American cultural
    landscape was novel and pleasantly confounding. It was the kind of album that, had it been a young band's
    debut, would have caused a much bigger fuss, but as it stood it was an album from a bunch of arty geezers
    led by a washed-up Beefheart imitator, and so it passed largely unnoticed by the small chunk of listening
    public that might have possibly cared.</p><p>
    
    Gentlemen, now's your chance to get in on the ground level with the follow-up, <i>St. Arkansas</i>.  When
    ol' Griel releases his Best of 2002 and maybe a dozen people rush to their local wax-monger, you can be
    all, ""Shit, dude, I've had that album since summer,"" and appear really wise.  Mind you, I'm not saying this
    is the best album of the year-- although, barring the absolutely unexpected, it <i>will</i> race neck-and-neck
    with Neil Young's <i>Are You Passionate?</i> for worst cover art of the year. They share that first-year
    Photoshop quality usually reserved for only the best Blue Oyster Cult double live albums on CMC International.</p><p>
    
    As for the music, though, <i>St. Arkansas</i> is roundly excellent, which no one in possession of their
    critical faculty and any one other Neil Young record can say of <i>Passionate</i>. It's a companion piece of
    sorts to <i>Pennsylvania</i> and shares much the same vocabulary, though <i>St. Arkansas</i> is the darker of
    the two.  Which is to say, it's more subdued and less rock-oriented, relying more on beat-style spoken-word
    storytelling and found sound.  There are some decently angular post-punk guitar moves here though-- something
    to show the kids who's boss-- but this incarnation of Pere Ubu relies just as much on its rhythm section.</p><p>
    
    Singer and frontman David Thomas (who somehow finds time to lead this band in addition to running like a
    bajillion burger joints and also recently dying) is in top form. He sounds less and less like Captain
    Beefheart as time goes on, and more like what you'd get if Jim Henson had been commissioned to create an
    animatron android of William S. Burroughs, like for Chuck E. Cheese or something. I realize this description
    is a bit ambiguous (these supposed to be good qualities?) but so is Thomas' voice-- it can be funny and
    scary simultaneously, both annoying and enthralling. Exploring the difference between wheezing and whining,
    sometimes brooding and sometimes absurdly chipper, it's an incredibly expressive instrument.</p><p>
    
    As far as I can tell, <i>St. Arkansas</i> is the complex tale of a sharp-dressed trucker (a ZZ Top fan, one
    might assume) whose passion in life is the open road.  He also has a thing for AM radio that I don't really
    get; the only good thing I've ever heard on AM was Art Bell and Cincinnati Reds broadcasts, and neither
    ever offered anything like what I'd call salvation. I can only assume Thomas is talking about some bygone
    era of AM, maybe the one Jonathan Richman so joyously celebrated in ""Roadrunner."" The tone here is wholly
    different, though. When Thomas repeats the mantra-like refrain, ""The radio/ AM radio/ Oh, the radio will set
    you free,"" on album-closing ""Dark,"" it's not a hopeful assurance but rather a mournful, wistful recollection
    of a promise heard long ago during a simpler, more innocent time.</p><p>
    
    To make a long and oblique story short, the trucker loses his hold on reality, ditches his wife and friends,
    and drives off a bridge or cliff or something, or maybe into a deep dark forest. It's obvious the songs form
    some sort of larger narrative, but beyond that, it's hard to know exactly what's happening. There's some
    water involved, and a ""ring of fire"" he must ""feed,"" and some greasy spoon diner where everyone is welcome.
    I don't exactly think this was meant to be some sort of mystery to be unlocked like a David Lynch movie. You
    can have fun trying to figure it all out and connect all the recurring imagery, but likewise, you can just
    let it roll and enjoy the ride.</p></div>"|6230.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6230-st-arkansas/|8.5|Jason Nickey

    a mix CD with a twist: Speedy J (Jochem Paap) hasn't merely raided
    his record racks to compile this mix-- he's composed entirely new
    tracks with which to work listeners into a sweaty fervor. It's a clear
    response to Richie Hawtin's <em>DE9: Close to the Edit</em>, in which
    Hawtin took a microtome to his collection of minimal techno. Using an
    advanced piece of software, Hawtin spliced these fragments into a
    seventy-minute mix of precision aloofness.  With <em>Loudboxer</em>,
    Speedy J seeks to trump Hawtin. Because the constituent tracks are
    his own, <em>Loudboxer</em> has a compositional unity and a personality
    that <em>DE9</em> sorely lacked.</p><p>
    
    The track titles Speedy J has given to <em>Loudboxer</em> are there
    mainly to signify points of transition, or first instances of
    introduced sound elements.  As is customary, the mix builds in
    intensity until the halfway point, at which Speedy J offers a brief
    respite in the form of a mumbled interlude. After that, it's another
    blast-off into unapologetically muscular techno.</p><p>
    
    Though the overall tenor of <em>Loudboxer</em> is the uncompromised
    violence of kick drums and searing hi-hat patterns, Speedy J
    contrasts the percussive thrust with tranquil elements, similar to
    those he spliced into the outstanding industrial funk of his two
    previous Novamute albums, <em>Public Energy No. 1</em> and <em>A
    Shocking Hobby</em>. But these ambient elements predate J's
    bangin' style. His albums in Warp's early-90s ""Artificial
    Intelligence"" series, <em>Ginger</em> and <em>G-Spot</em>, belittled beats
    in deference to drifting, ambient nebulae; <em>Loudboxer</em> reverses
    this arrangement.</p><p>
    
    As well as outscoring Hawtin's <em>DE9</em>, <em>Loudboxer</em> also
    outplays the two volumes of Frankie Bone's Computer Controlled
    series. For those two releases, Bones came up with his own tracks,
    cut them onto twelve-inch acetates and mixed them live before a
    riled-up crowd of Californian ravers.  Apart from a minute-long track
    recorded live, <em>Loudboxer</em> doesn't document the reflective energy
    of thousands of ecstatic punters.  However, the album does offer the
    listener the high-quality mix CD that techno purists have long
    suspected Speedy J could deliver.</p><p>
    
    Yet, I must confess I'm disappointed with this release. I had hoped
    that Speedy J would continue his exploration of cyborg funk, begun
    with <em>Public Energy No. 1</em> and furthered and peaked with the
    mutant beauty of <em>A Shocking Hobby</em>. I trust that Speedy J,
    satisfied that he's KO'd his labelmate Hawtin, will drop his battle
    stance and return to his pioneering experimental style.</p></div>"|7413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7413-loudboxer/|6.3|Paul Cooper

    With every salvo of their 'cartoon-simple' brand of battery acid, they came one step closer to demystifying
    music, and in my pre-jaded, pre-cynical youth, I <i>idolized</i> them for it.  Now, of course, my ironclad
    contract with the Hegemony of Music Critics (HMC) prevents me from idolizing anyone because of 'ironic
    distance,' so the best I can do is admire them as genre-defining artists.  Just between you and me, though,
    they rock.</p><p>
    
    As of June 5th, 2002, fully half of the Ramones-- Joey and Dee Dee-- are gone.  Two Ramones in two years!
    It's selfish, but I feel robbed.  Naturally, there will be tributes, posthumous releases, and more
    compilations, but somehow, a document like <i>CBGB's and the Birth of U.S. Punk</i> seems more fitting,
    as well as timely.  As good as they were, the Ramones were just a single aspect of the seminal punk scene
    they came to symbolize.  The 'garage rock revival' that holds the music world in thrall has them to thank,
    along with a dozen other bands who came before; not only the classics like the Velvets and Television, but
    scores of influential also-rans like the Dead Boys, the Sonics, and the Electric Eels.  So for anyone who
    can't get enough of the Strokes, the Hives, or the Plural Nouns, <i>The Birth of U.S. Punk</i> stands not
    only as a damn fine album, but an even better history lesson (that is, assuming you don't already know it).</p><p>
    
    CBGB's, the legendary heart of the 70s New York punk scene, is really of secondary importance here-- despite
    any stints in-house, most of the groups compiled here were showing elsewhere before they made their
    pilgrimages to Hilly Kristal's club.  Instead, this album is a love letter to an era.  These eighteen tracks
    try to capture the punk movement sweeping the U.S. at its raw, nihilistic roots, and mostly succeed.  The
    record has all the necessary anthems, from the pogo power of the Ramones' original demo of ""Judy Is a Punk""
    to the unbridled cynicism of ""Blank Generation"" by Richard Hell's Voidoids.  The Velvet Underground ends up
    waiting for the man, and Iggy and the Stooges even stop by to talk about ""Tight Pants"" (a nice touch,
    considering everyone already knows ""Search and Destroy"" and the other obvious choices).  Almost all the big
    names drop by, save the Talking Heads because Union Square couldn't get them licensed, and the MC5, who
    never played CBGB's.</p><p>
    
    More importantly, <i>The Birth of U.S. Punk</i> highlights those bands that missed out on the spotlight.
    The Sonics' rendition of ""Louie Louie"" sounds more like the soundtrack to a slasher pic about a guy named
    Louie than the Richard Berry original and hits like a train wreck.  The original mix of the Dead Boys'
    explosive ""Sonic Reducer"" and the New York Dolls' ""Trash"" encapsulate the aimless desperation of the mean
    streets of NYC in convenient three-minute bursts.  And after that, there's still Suicide, Johnny Thunders,
    and Pere Ubu to round out the generally stellar guest list for this little shindig.</p><p>
    
    Too bad being a great album and educating America's Strokaholics don't always coincide, because the interests
    of serving history have led to the inclusion of a few truly wretched pieces of the curriculum.  The Seeds and
    the Electric Eels may have held some sway in the early days of U.S. punk, but subjecting people to the
    unrelenting whine of ""Excuse, Excuse"" or ""Agitated,"" respectively, is a lesson this album could live without--
    not to mention the single-handed butchering of the Electric Prunes' classic psych nugget ""I Had Too Much to
    Dream Last Night"" by Wayne County.  Some of this is revisionist history, as well, like seeing the 13th Floor
    Elevators and the Dead Kennedys alongside Television.  No disrespect to Jello, but he's more of a by-product
    of this movement than a cause.</p><p>
    
    The one truly inexplicable decision, though, was not arranging the tracks chronologically.  Honestly, that's
    just retarded.  When chronicling the progression of anything, what would possess someone to do it out of
    order?  It's not like you're gonna come up with any kind of cohesion with a compilation.  And considering
    that this information is readily available through obvious sources, Union Square doesn't have much of an
    excuse.  But somehow, even for all of its preventable shortcomings, <i>CBGB's and the Birth of U.S. Punk</i>
    still holds up pretty well.  From the punk ballistics of the Ramones to the minimal hum of Suicide's ""Speed
    Queen,"" this is where so much of what's out there right now takes root.  There's enough soul and fire on
    this release to gently remind everyone that no matter how much this garage revival looks like a movement,
    most of the kids are really just going through the motions.</p></div>"|2009.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2009-cbgbs-and-the-birth-of-us-punk/|7.1|Eric Carr

    crooner who guards the right-hand extremity of the continuum, Scott Walker. Sitting on the left-hand
    extremity is Bono, nearby him Peter Gabriel, Marc Almond, Lou Reed, Gavin Friday, and the Laughing Gnome
    himself, David Bowie. Sylvian is clearly indebted to Bowie. His previous band, Japan, mined Bowie's glam
    and Berlin periods and derived some memorable songs.  Sylvian thinks of himself as more than a pop star and
    leader of a long-defunct new wave band; he's an artist-in-sound, luvvie, and he's going out of his way to
    prove he could be more of an egghead than Brian Eno if he really wanted to be.</p><p>
    As last year's two-disc retrospective <i>Everything and Nothing</i> demonstrated, David Sylvian has always
    strived to experiment and to challenge his audience. Without resorting to Scott Walker's allusive abstractions,
    Sylvian takes banal sentiments and, through quirky metaphor or idiosyncratic musical arrangement, never fails
    to distinguish himself. However, the watchword here is 'experiment.' Sylvian's back catalog is more
    interesting, to my ears, for its lush failures rather than its successes. And no question that <i>Everything
    and Nothing</i>-- and now <i>Camphor</i>, its instrumental companion-- abounds in fascinating imperfections.</p><p>
    Sylvian is capable of achieving flawlessness. As I noted in my review of <i>Everything and Nothing</i>, his
    song ""Ghosts"" has every right to ascend to the canonical status of standard. It would take a brave singer to
    start the trend, but as Dave Douglas and Susana Baca have both attempted to make a case for Björk's ""Unison""
    and ""The Anchor Song"" to be as widely performed as unworthy material, it's not inconceivable that someone
    might have a go.</p><p>
    Flawlessness is not Sylvian's goal. If it were, he'd repeat ""Ghosts"" over and over again.  Rather, in order
    to further his pretensions to art, Sylvian has bought into an aesthetic dualism that Leonard Cohen summed up
    succinctly with the line, ""There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in."" For Sylvian, true
    beauty must have a flaw.  <i>Camphor</i> sure has flaws, but it also possesses instances of true beauty, too.
    Drawn from his solo as well as his collaborative works, the cerebral instrumentals that comprise <i>Camphor</i>
    mark Sylvian's consistent voyage through acoustic soundworlds. Where others would content themselves with the
    sonic equivalent of CGI, Sylvian means to take fresh approaches using sometimes centuries-old instruments.
    Of course, unlike some unknown or obscure manipulator of soundfiles, Sylvian's reputation affords him the
    time and luxury to ask Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot, Robert Fripp, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Talvin Singh, Mark Isham,
    Nils Petter Molvaer, and sundry members of Can to drop by the studio for a spell. And the folks at Virgin
    Records kindly obliged when confronted with the bill for studio time.</p><p>
<i>Camphor</i> opens with ""All My Mothers' Names"" and Marc Ribot performing a Robert Fripp impersonation of
    John McLaughlin's <i>Inner Mounting Flame</i> period while Ryuichi Sakamoto dapples on his Rhodes piano in
    deft approximation of same-era Jan Hammer. The jagged guitar work will disrupt wherever this track is placed,
    and in its original context on the <i>Dead Bees on a Cake</i> album, ""All My Mothers' Names"" really got on
    my tits.  But acting as an overture on <i>Camphor</i>, the track epitomizes Sylvian's wantonly brainiac and
    sometimes misguided fusion of awkwardness and serenity. In this capacity, if you can appreciate the track jags
    and all, you'll find the thirteen other tracks far easier going.</p><p>
    ""Red Earth (As Summertime Ends)"" is placid in comparison. Taken from the sole <i>Rain Tree Crow</i> album
    (essentially a Japan reunion in all but name), the track is a mildly Afro-funk ambient piece, not so
    dissimilar to the second half of Brian Eno's and David Byrne's <i>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</i>. Also
    from <i>Rain Tree Crow</i>, ""New Moon at Red Deer Wallow"" blends curious bass clarinet lines with
    call-and-response percussion. The effect is similar to that which Jon Hassell and Eno achieved on their
    highly influential <i>Possible Worlds</i> album.</p><p>
    In addition to remixes of previously released tracks, <i>Camphor</i> features two new songs. Both ""The Song
    Which Gives the Key to Perfection"" and ""Praise (Pratah Smarami)"" display Sylvian's devotion to Hinduism.
    Sylvian's vocals on the former are some of the most heartfelt and restrained I've ever heard from him, and
    the instrumentation he chooses to set them in is movingly unadorned. It's such a pity that the accompanying
    booklet offers no translation of the lyrics-- I'd love to know what wisdom inspired his reverence.
    Sylvian gives equally Spartan accompaniment to ""Praise (Pratah Smarami),"" featuring Shree Maa, a guru whose
    devotees consider an embodiment of the Hindu mother goddess, Durga.  Sylvian surrounds her mournful
    inflections with soft sheets of ambience, akin to those that he and Holger Czukay used on their must-have
    1988 blissful lament <i>Plight and Premonition</i>.</p><p>
    As obnoxious counterpoint to the simple elegance of ""Praise (Pratah Smarami),"" ""Big Wheels in Shanty Town""
    is Frankie Goes to Hollywood's <i>Welcome to the Pleasuredome</i> prepared for the WOMAD crowd. ""The Healing
    Place"" (excerpted from <i>Gone to Earth)</i> approximates the plaintive grandeur of ""Ghosts"" with Bill Nelson's
    guitar replacing Sylvian's sorrowful-opulent vocals.  Yet, once again obeying his doctrine that for every
    success he must stump up a lush lapse of judgment, Sylvian plunges <i>Camphor</i> into ineptitude with the
    title track. Here, he gives his dilettantish take on glitch, and Fennesz or Stefan Betke he's not. He gloms,
    stutters and rips to his trademark moody ambience without understanding the wealth of expression that
    glitches can afford. ""Camphor"" spins around asking, ""Isn't this what the youngsters are doing?"" and all the
    listener can do is gape at the incoherent coalescence of sounds.</p><p>
    By re-recording the vocals for <i>Everything and Nothing</i>, Sylvian went part way to impose a unity of
    performance on compositions drawn from many periods in his career.  And by remixing a few of the tracks here,
    Sylvian's attempting a similar trick for <i>Camphor</i>.  Unfortunately, the almost unnoticeable tweaks to
    the remixed tracks don't force a new stylistic continuity that would dupe listeners into considering this
    record worthwhile. Therefore, I'm left to conclude that <i>Camphor</i> is very much a flawed digest of
    Sylvian's moody experiments.  If purchased as a gateway to Sylvian's catalog, it'll lead you to far more
    significant records. Otherwise, this scattered selection will leave you wondering if Pitchfork's thinking
    person's crooner male continuum is guilty of producing an egregiously false positive result.</p></div>"|7683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7683-camphor/|6.6|Paul Cooper

    Ummm, wait a second here.  This music isn't groovy at all.  Well,
    it's got some neat grooves, but they're better for contemplating the
    shiny edges of razor blades than for driving around with the windows
    down.  Time to look around for some info.  What's that?  This record
    came out last winter?  You're kidding me!  Anyway, it seems like
    Shiner and the good folks at DeSoto had the right time all picked out
    to release an album like this: late November 2001, in the height of
    seasonal affective disorders, anthrax paranoia, and gloomy, grey
    weather presiding over stark, bare trees.  Not that you couldn't
    listen to <em>The Egg</em> in any given month-- it's just best suited
    to the time of year when the days are short and brutishly cold.</p><p>
    
    The band doesn't waste any time letting you know where they're coming
    from, opening with the harsh, heavy salvo of ""The Truth About Cows,""
    a ragged slough through the sludgy bog of post-grunge.  It's the kind
    of stuff that major label A&amp;R; has been cleaning up for mass
    consumption since 1994, only played with more authenticity and
    feeling than the schlock-angst posterboys of Creed and 3 Doors
    Down could ever muster.  Needless to say, this stuff sounds a lot
    better when it's dirty and raw, and Shiner's six-string bloodletting
    beats the crap out of anything you'll hear on commercial FM these
    days.</p><p>
    
    A large part of what makes Shiner's sound so visceral and engaging is
    the production work of ex-Jawbox guitarist and Burning Airlines CEO J
    Robbins, who keeps things distinct, but exceptionally jagged.  He
    lends the pitch-black doom-rock of ""Spook the Herd"" and ""Stoner"" an
    austere, rough-edged sound that drives them straight home with no
    detours.  The crunch of the bass on the mathy and Jawbox-esque
    ""Surgery"" alone makes the song an engaging listen, but the interplay
    of the chorused guitars on top uses it as a remarkably effective
    springboard for even more compelling guitar leads and interlocking
    rhythms.</p><p>
    
    That black-eye bass tone is at the root of several of the album's
    most successful rockers, including the excellent title track, with
    its vaulting melody and frenetic drum pattern.  The guitars play it
    clean most of the time, making it all the more effective when the
    distortion kicks in for a chorus or the coda.  The end of ""Play Dead""
    employs this dynamic particularly well, as sheets of distortion bring
    the song crashing to a close.</p><p>
    
    Despite the band's efficiency with their hard-rock bread and butter,
    they're at their most interesting when they deviate from it, as they
    do for the appropriately icy ""The Top of the World.""  You get the
    impression that this is what Shiner might sound like if Jonny
    Greenwood got his hands on them, as it basically sounds like a normal
    Shiner song collapsed into a bed of thumping rhythms, slow-motion
    music boxes and oozing guitar noise.  The bass throbs and smears
    while vocalist Allen Epley lets his vocals slide dejectedly into the
    mix.</p><p>
    
    More interesting, though, is ""The Simple Truth,"" which opens with
    fractured bass and drum rhythms under pulsing guitars and breaks down
    into a long, spooky coda full of vibes, synth washes and ghostly
    guitar accents.  The instrumental ""Andalusia"" sends swelling synths
    into orbit around a stuttering rock axis, giving Shiner a chance to
    display some of their impressive chops without stepping into an
    all-out wankfest.</p><p>
    
    If there's a criticism you could level at Shiner, it's perhaps that
    despite the obvious attempts to diversify their sound, they still
    come off a little monochromatic-- their brand of precise, jagged rock
    can get a little numbing.  Otherwise, Shiner are a pretty good bet if
    you're looking for some dark, rough post-grunge to accompany your
    allotted brooding time.  Just don't come looking for sunshine.  Now,
    if you'll excuse me, I'm going to blow the table fan in my cubicle up
    my shirt sleeves.</p></div>"|7111.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7111-the-egg/|7.4|Joe Tangari

After a lifetime of hardship and struggle, the caterpillar emerges
    from its cocoon, soaring majestically over all of creation.  The world is its oyster, and what does it do?
    It flies off to the nearest bug-zapper and incinerates itself, or gets eaten by something.  There aren't
    many bigger letdowns in the animal kingdom.  With Moth's debut, <i>Provisions, Fiction and Gear</i>, rock
    imitates life as an album that emerges as a solid, infectious effort, but eventually collapses under its own
    weight, unable to keep all its stylistic efforts coherent.</p><p>
    Moth's basic nature is fairly simple.  Bristling, guitar-driven melodies and sometimes-too-cutesy, only
    slightly irritating vocals are their primary tools for survival, in addition to ex-Rocket From the Crypt
    drummer Atom Willard's exceptional percussion (and awesome name).  However, being clever creatures, Moth camouflages their sound throughout
    <i>Provisions</i> with plenty of variations on this theme in order to confound potential critics.  Constantly
    alternating between crunchy and smooth, loud and soft, bouncy and sober, the album never sits still long
    enough to let listeners settle in or second-guess.  This sonically varied defense mechanism works to prevent
    Moth from being easily pigeonholed, but leads to a few forays into some ugly territory.  No matter what a
    person's tastes, it's tough to imagine that anyone will be pleased by every track if taken sequentially.</p><p>
    In its larval stage, Moth has a soul of solid pogo punk, which they combine with the brains and sensibilities
    of art-rockers like Les Savy Fav.  Provisions barrels out of the gate with ""I See Sound"" and ""Thinking Please,""
    two mighty anthems of pop energy that immediately set a blistering pace.  ""Burning Down My Sanity"" really
    starts to show signs of this entity's development, building slowly on top of a pulsing drum rhythm that
    absolutely owns your hips until it's punctuated by a Yankee Stadium-sized guitar solo.  The faint hint of
    southern drawl in the vocals gives the song a surreal edge, somewhat akin to the otherworldly experience of
    watching Ron Popeil hock food dehydrators at four in the morning.</p><p>
    At its zenith, <i>Provisions</i> is all set to metamorph into something truly spectacular with ""Lovers
    Quarrel.""  Here, a Merritt-esque song about feelings gets into a fight with a massive, bass-spewing robot,
    while droning guitars and piano cheer them on.  The resulting brawl is the auditory high-water mark, some
    of the impact of which is lessened with the paranoid schizophrenic ""Cocaine Star"" that immediately follows.
    A touching tale of love, drug abuse, and snowplow killing sprees, this song and ""Lovers Quarrel"" are like
    matter and anti-matter colliding.  It's a jarring, not-altogether-pleasant experience, but the resulting
    emission of rock power is still pretty impressive.</p><p>
    Like a gyroscope faltering before completely losing its axis, Moth now puts on the air brakes and steers
    <i>Provisions</i> directly into the ground.  I might be exaggerating a bit-- the last three tracks aren't
    really awful; they just let the upbeat, slightly absurdist tone that works so well in the earlier tracks
    fall by the wayside.  No, wait, that's not entirely true either.  ""Straight Line"" is pretty damn bad-- if
    you check, you might be able to find it in heavy rotation on KSUK 66.6 bookended by the latest Papa Roach
    single, ""We're Rich and It's All Your Fault (Verizon Wireless Mix),"" and the Enrique Iglesias hit, ""I'm
    Talentless (No Tengo Ningún Talento).""  Also, the chorus to ""Not Really"" reminds me so much of the opening
    seconds of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" that it triggers eighth-grade <i>Wayne's World</i> acid flashbacks.  (Queen,
    from Lucifer's heart, I stab at thee!)  In and of themselves, these closing tracks are semi-palatable, but
    together they're truly hard to stomach.</p><p>
    There's a lot to like about this album, and these guys might have what it takes to make it in the wild
    somewhere on down the line.  But for now, like their ill-fated namesake, Moth's <i>Provisions, Fiction
    and Gear</i> moves into the light just when it finally starts to get somewhere.  I couldn't bring myself to
    downgrade it too harshly since most of the album is pretty enjoyable, but be warned: this album is all
    over the place.  If you're like me-- and for your sake, I hope not-- you hate disappointment, and Moth's
    debut never quite finishes what it starts.</p></div>"|5443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5443-provisions-fiction-and-gear/|6.9|Eric Carr

The poor old guy has enough to deal
    with-- his jazzbo peers are playing it close to trad bop, and the
    whippersnappers are either copycats of their elders, or are off on
    some experimental Klezmer trip-hop tangent.  And it's not as if
    Bailey ever really fit in with jazzbos in the first place, what
    with the whole idea of 'spontaneous' music and improvising with no
    preconceived set of parameters, much less precedents.  Zorn steps in,
    makes a few calls, and Bailey ends up playing sets with noisemongers
    like Ruins, or is somehow booked into sessions making drum-n-bass
    records, or playing world-funk with Ornette Coleman's bassist.
    Come on, man, let the guy be!</p><p>
    
    But Bailey has been above and beyond the call of jazz duty for a good
    40 years now, and his latest Zorn-provoked project of playing
    ultra-classy standards might just be the pendant on his
    spiky-splendored coat of a career.  He was playing free jazz in
    London in the mid-60s with Tony Oxley and Dave Holland (before Miles
    Davis tasted his first crumpet).  He formed renowned Incus Records
    with Oxley and Evan Parker in the 70s when turning skronk into
    profit was but a twinkle in Zorn's eye. And he's outlasted all but
    the most shamelessly devoted to the biz by playing an improvised
    sound so idiosyncratic it effectively defies analytical criticism.</p><p>
    
    Still, there's something to be said about an old dog, new tricks and
    a lifetime of artistic expression: <em>Ballads</em> is a remarkable
    record for Bailey.  As on recent efforts such as 2000's <em>Mirakle</em>
    or 1998's <em>Play Backs</em>, the concept places Bailey in a strange
    context and observes the outcome.  However, instead of putting him
    in a group or adding strange studio effects, the gimmick here is
    Bailey's interpretations of classic tunes written by the likes of
    Hoagy Carmichael and Victor Young.  Bailey actually started out
    playing straight ahead small group jazz in the 50s, so this material
    isn't actually so far from his palette.  Furthermore, his acoustic
    guitar playing is so delicate and sympathetic to the tunes, it's hard
    to believe he ever left those old standards behind.</p><p>
    
    Bailey's improvisations here are at once impenetrable and immediately
    familiar.  If you've followed his work, you know that he can make
    his guitars sound as if they were made only for him, and in this
    case, he actually went to the trouble of finding one that was
    ""totally inappropriate for playing standards.""  Marc Ribot writes in
    the liner notes for <em>Ballads</em> that Bailey's playing draws on
    sources ""far wider than those employed in jazz"" and how his striking
    sounds ""don't sever the relation of song to improvisation, but
    [create] deeper, less predictable relations.""  This will undoubtedly
    come down to the listener, as there were definitely a couple of
    occasions when I lost track of the standard, and slipped into a
    world completely of Bailey's making.</p><p>
    
    ""Laura"" opens the CD, as Bailey strums light harmonics, and jumps
    into David Raskin's rather romantic original melody.  The guitarist
    sounds so at home playing the chords that, though he freely mixes in
    atonal ornaments, it never really sounds juxtaposed.  He sometimes
    settles on angular figures, breaking the romantic mood, but rather
    than erase the beauty of the melody, he seems to contemplate it,
    effortlessly letting his mind wander when it will.  If you're used
    to hearing the Wes Montgomery side of things, this will be a bit
    disorienting.</p><p>
    
    All of the tunes on this set run together, like a stream-of-conscious
    classic pop revue.  Johnny Burke's ""What's New"" is born out of the
    improvisation from ""Laura,"" passing by so quickly you might miss the
    melody.  Even as it segues into ""When Your Lover Has Gone,"" you might
    still be reveling in Bailey's forceful free-strum of the previous
    tune.  However, he does come down every now and then to reveal the
    tune's inherently nostalgic, almost cinematic charm-- only to launch
    into flighty, jarring figures that wouldn't have sounded out of place
    on his Ruins albums.  This is one of those times you might forget
    he's playing standards.</p><p>
    
    The most beautiful moments on <em>Ballads</em> come with the completely
    unexpected instances of clarity in Bailey's improvisations.  In ""You
    Go to My Head,"" after the tune and typically restless commentary, he
    begins to rest on eerily perfect octaves.  Even though he can spend a
    lifetime following his muse to the chagrin of anyone that ever wanted
    to break free of convention, Bailey still has the discipline, dedication
    and love for the sound all around him that he can make simple unison
    lines speak as resonantly as the most chaotic fanfare of dissonance.
    Bailey's ability to let the song go where the improvisation takes it--
    while resisting the temptation to veer completely off course-- is the
    mark of a true artist, and <em>Ballads</em> is a fine entryway to the
    appreciation of Bailey's art.</p></div>"|530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/530-ballads/|8.1|Dominique Leone

    more than you'd like to. Next time you need to ditch a spare mate,
    toss this afflicted opus into your 85-CD changer. Your partner will
    first perceive the swirling goulash creeping from your speakers as
    a vote of confidence: ""Hey, all right-- some purposefully obscure
    sounds!  This ain't no Yo La Tengo date!  We're committing carnal
    sins to some rarities!""  But as soon as Daniel Smith unleashes his
    voice-- an agitated palsetto that performs spastic cartwheels on the
    outer rim of aural bearability-- your guest will take the hint, get
    spooked and pack up, and your night will be stain-free.</p><p>
    
    Ahhh, but now you're alone, and the Smith clan begins to work their
    way toward your brain like Christian-engineered versions of the
    parasites in <em>The Wrath of Khan</em>. You could keep your cool
    through the simple, sweeping rhythm of head-bobber ""Nice of Me,""
    which sounds like the pre-looping loopers Silver Apples if they
    played different instruments. You might even think you've got these
    guys figured out: it's mid-fi, psych-folk, faux-outsider music, like
    Johnny Dowd, or the Tinklers, or Jad Fair. Song two, ""Feeling Tank,""
    also goes down relatively easy, the closest this record's 71 minutes
    comes to a singalong.</p><p>
    
    The rest of the album is a shambling, cacophonic, insane, and very
    original journey through several minty-fresh themes: avoiding
    physical pain, seeking comfort, suppressing loin-burn, abandoning
    self-ownership, and fleeing nothingness.  Daniel Smith rides both
    sides of Kierkegaard's seesaw-- dreading the subjugation of your
    own will to an Other, while simultaneously being grateful for the
    offload.  In one song, God demands ten pushups when Dan ""screws up,""
    so Dan offers to do a thousand. In another, someone's funeral is
    running a bit early, so God ""gets the DJ"" and there's a dance party.
    This is definitely not the low-frequency ponderance of moral dilemmas
    a la Pedro the Lion or Starflyer 59, but it ain't white-boy gospel
    either. Smith's bizarre voice, occasionally multitracked, so
    consciously pursues caricature that he somehow evades it, ably
    handling universal tensions with a bluntness that circumvents the
    ready-set-sincerity of someone like Elliott Smith.</p><p>
    
    Daniel Smith comes across as embattled as the God-wrasslin' poet
    Gerard Manley Hopkins when he confronts fleshly desires (this album
    was-- groan-- his thesis at Rutgers). ""God Bless"" is about feeling
    soiled by ""the everyday,"" and the refrain of ""Burnin' Heart"" is ""I am
    afraid of sex"" (or is that 'sects'?).  On the great ""Be Your
    Wildman,"" Smith sings with his sisters about where his brains and
    loins differ, and how he deserves to be ""drop-kicked.""  Maybe the
    high voice is a homage to eunuchs, but I guarantee you've heard
    nothing like this song.  In addition to the theodicy, these songs
    expand the band's scope. ""Bless"" eventually morphs into a rickety,
    pre-teen Slint impression; ""Burnin'"" busts into Sonic Youth Group
    Hayride thrash; and ""Headz"" uses every pedal in the DOD catalog to
    create a samplable kind of wiggy, avant-""Kumbayah"" dub, complete
    with dissonant, rubbery Thinking Fellers-style breakdowns.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, though, this no doubt earnest art project seems like a
    documentary of an anthropological oddity, a connection made stronger
    by this re-release's CD-ROM of presentations, performances and
    videos.  Seeing the Danielsons live, with Smith in a trippy,
    McDonaldland tree costume and his adopted 'siblings' in
    medical uniforms can fill you with a kind of rapturous spirit, even
    if the albums don't inspire you to repent.  But I can't imagine that
    anyone will want to replay songs such as the tempoless ""Like a
    Vacuum,"" which, for all its philosophical lyrical force, trails off,
    starts over, erupts into tambourine chaos and then into fake laughing
    (reminiscent of the cackling spirit-moved, truck-hungry,
    sleep-deprived Christian in the documentary <em>Hands on a
    Hardbody</em>). You can't drive to the beach to a documentary. You
    can't even drive to the liquor store pumping this disc.</p><p>
    
    The record's only reward for those who patiently revisit it is an
    appreciation of Smith's uniqueness.  But give the blonde redheads in
    this Garden State Social Club props for trumping the boredom of status
    quo American Christianity with their raw-nerve madness.  Anybody could
    have thrown something tinny together, but as the rollicking drums and
    doom-carnival xylophones of ""In the Malls, Not of Them"" prove, this
    almost-listenable stuff is meticulously assembled.  This family's
    tradition of having a spontaneous song hour should make anyone who
    suffered through a standard fundie childhood jealous of their
    relative culturelessness-- like when your Jewish neighbors went to
    gymnastics at their community center.  Our rec center just gave us
    tater tots and put on ""Mr. Belvedere."" Though the Danielsons'
    atmosphere occasionally out-sophisticates their primitivity, this
    record is a few hinges short. You can tell a person about all the
    extratextual stuff, get 'em interested and then play the album, but
    no stereo can equalize it to give it even a toehold on your
    already-slippery reality. Few albums so aptly yelp, in form and
    content, ""Up, up, and shirts on. Let's not have sex.""</p></div>"|2165.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2165-a-prayer-for-every-hour/|6.7|William Bowers

In a
    best-of-all-possible-worlds scenario, the tribute album can be
    mutually beneficial for both artists and the industry. They
    theoretically allow artists the ability to both honor their
    influences and appear more musically sophisticated.  If you're unable
    to appear on a tribute album for a highly obscure, yet supposedly
    seminal Danish psychedelic band, you have to go out of your way to
    find the most obscure song ever recorded by the recognizable band
    you're covering.  Labels, in the meantime, reap the benefits of audience
    identification with both the coverer and the coveree. Strictly
    hypothetical example being: ""People love Tom Petty. People love
    Incubus. If Incubus also happens to love Tom Petty, we may be able
    to move some serious units.""</p><p>
    
    Mint Records' recent <em>Nashville</em> tribute targets diehard fans of
    both Robert Altman and Neko Case.  And, just so you know, all twelve
    of them have already purchased this record and cancelled their
    <em>Short Cuts</em> screening party to write poison pen letters to me
    at first sight of that 5.9 (never fear-- I'm a fan of both Robert
    Altman and Neko Case. I'll be nice, I promise).  It's not a
    particularly intimidating demographic.  <em>Nashville</em> is a
    brilliant film, featuring a superior script and a fairly astonishing
    ensemble cast.  It's one of the best films of the 1970s-- a decade
    synonymous with great filmmaking-- and I don't think I'd be overstating
    if I called it a classic of American cinema.  In spite of (or perhaps
    because of) its reputation, I didn't get around to seeing it until just
    last year; it didn't change my life or anything, but I liked it.  So,
    I can't exactly hold it against you if you haven't rushed out to the
    local Pic-A-Flic to rent this musical/comedy/satire tour de force
    about politics and country music.</p><p>
    
    Mint Records' tribute is an almost perfect replica of the movie's
    soundtrack, with the artists on the album playing the part of the
    actors singing as their characters from the film.  In the filming of
    <em>Nashville</em>, Altman gave each of the actors the opportunity to
    write their own songs for the characters they portrayed.  On the
    tribute, Canadian alt.country performer Carolyn Mark doled out the
    songs to her circle of friends and/or Mint labelmates. On Mint
    Records' <em>Nashville</em>, the part of sleazy, self-righteous town
    greeter Henry Haven (originally played and subsequently sung by Henry
    Gibson) is sung by both Dave Lang (the preachy, hilariously maudlin
    ""For the Sake of the Children"") and Dave Gowans (the jingoistic
    bicentennial tune ""200 Years"").  Both do a competent job emulating
    the smarm factor in Gibson's original delivery.</p><p>
    
    Like most of this album, there's not a considerable amount of
    originality in the Mint artists' versions versus the original.  It's
    not a completely re-envisioned album, it's just <em>Nashville</em>
    replayed by a bunch of Canadians and a couple New Pornographers
    (note, however, that New Pornographer Carl Newman's ""Memphis"" is not
    among the album's high points).  Neko Case does a fine job with
    ""Rolling Stone,"" eclipsing Karen Black's original by sheer vocal
    power alone. Likewise, Carolyn Mark's renditions of the Ronee Blakley
    numbers (""My Idaho Home"" and ""One, I Love You"") romp all over the
    original material.</p><p>
    
    But outside of stirring up interest for an admittedly good movie,
    and occasional moments of stellar vocal work, I can't really figure
    out why one would want to buy this album on its own merits.  Even
    the original soundtrack (found on vinyl with some ease at many
    friendly neighborhood Goodwills for about a dollar, give or take
    some scratches), removed from the film, is little more than a novelty
    piece. <em>Nashville</em> is a non-linear sort of musical, so you can't
    exactly follow the story by ear alone the way you could, say,
    <em>Oklahoma</em>.  Maybe all those Altman/Neko Case fans will eat it

Jeremy likes Sonic Youth.  His favorite album by the
    Youth is <em>Goodbye 20th Century</em>, their self-released cover
    album of avant-garde works by various modern classical composers.
    The CDs currently in his five-disc changer are Shalabi's
    <i>St-Orange</i>, Xiu Xiu, Merzbow, the Boredoms, and Fennesz.</p><p>
    
    Meet Erica.  Erica likes Sonic Youth.  Her favorite album by the
    Youth is <em>Dirty</em>, the band's most direct flirtation with
    mainstream rock.  The CDs currently in Erica's five disc-changer
    are the Breeders, Blonde Redhead, Wilco, Neutral Milk Hotel, and
    Sleater-Kinney.</p><p>
    
    Oversimplified personifications?  Sure, but chances are, if you're a
    fan of the twenty-year-old Sonic Youth franchise, you probably exist
    at some point on a continuum between my little creations above.  The
    band itself has been running a zig-zag pattern on the same scale its
    entire existence, constantly oscillating between their art-noise
    laboratory and major-label rock band personae while covering all
    points in between.  As a result, you don't see the Jeremies and
    Ericas of the world coming together over a single Sonic Youth record
    too often-- if one is jammin', the other's likely scoffin' or wincin'.
    Not since the sprawling <em>Daydream Nation</em> (and arguably, its
    predecessor and follow-up) have the two been able to slow-dance to the
    same song collection.</p><p>
    
    Movie Trailer Voiceover Guy: ""Until now...!""</p><p>
    
    Yup, <em>Murray Street</em> is Sonic Youth's first successful convergence
    of envelope-pushing guitarwork and accessible songery since 1988.  I'm
    smart enough to not go too far down the dead-end alleyway of <em>Daydream
    Nation</em> comparisons, but I'll admit it reminds me a helluva lot of
    that masterwork-- more so than any of their records between then and now.
    And I don't think it's coincidental that the two albums showcase a band
    more relaxed than elsewhere, letting songs stretch out to their maximum
    length while still coming back for a singalong-able section or two.</p><p>
    
    As everyone probably expected, that whole 'this is our classic rock
    album' gambit was a big goof.  While the band's new quintet structure
    offers the potential for some Skynyrd-style three-guitar freakouts,
    the guys and gal limit themselves to the occasional old-school namedrop
    (Lou Reed, ""Tiny Dancer"") and a handful of FM-ready riffs.  No, Sonic
    Youth still sounds like good ol' Sonic Youth, albeit with a focus on
    melodic improvisation only rarely heard before.</p><p>
    
    If the band is revealing its roots to any oldies act, it's to Lee
    Ranaldo's long-cherished Grateful Dead.  Three tracks here run
    long-distance events in the six-to-nine-minute range, and one
    (Ranaldo's ""Karen Revisited"") rides a long ambient section all the
    way up to 11:00.  Sonic Youth's always had long songs, but not too
    many that stay as tightly focused and listenable as these; they're
    finally capitalizing on the jammy possibilities suggested by ""The
    Diamond Sea.""  ""Rain on Tin,"" for example, gets the singing over with
    in a hurry and dwells mostly on long, instrumental passages that
    intertwine the three guitars like a fourth-grader braiding friendship
    bracelets.</p><p>
    
    Importantly, these astral flights are usually filling in the space
    around semi-traditional song structures, avoiding the spoken-word
    incantations and directionless instrumentals of recent albums on
    both DGC and SYR imprints.  If vocal duties can be considered
    representative of songwriting leadership, it's Thurston Moore who's
    leading the charge here, as he takes the mic on more than half of
    <i>Murray Street</i>'s songs.  His twisty ""The Empty Page"" and spooky
    ""Disconnection Notice"" are certainly no new directions for the
    lankiest man in rock and roll, but offer up foundations as exciting
    to hear as the unscripted passages. </p><p>
    
    Kim Gordon's contributions, meanwhile, are curiously backloaded to
    the end of the album-- a sequencing that would have been merciful on
    the last few albums, but is surprisingly unnecessary for the double
    shot of goodness found here.  ""Plastic Sun,"" which may or may not be
    about Britney Spears (have we forgotten our Madonna fetish, Youthies?),
    packs more rhythmic punch than anything since the ""Eliminator Jr.""
    portion of ""Trilogy.""  Likewise, her ""Sympathy for the Strawberry""
    hits slow-motion crescendos as bombastic as Godspeed, with a mere
    fraction of the personnel.  The centerpiece, ""Karen Revisited,"" finds
    Ranaldo again claiming his crown as the band's best hook-writer before
    exploding into ultraviolet feedback-- a segment that'll have Jeremy
    doing cartwheels, but'll have Erica jumping for the fast-forward button.</p><p>
    
    And then, there's Jim O'Rourke.  Ahhh, Jim; say what you will about
    the guy, but he's now worked his mysterious influence over not
    one, but two of the year's finest albums (and it's only June)-- I
    fully expect him to announce production duties on some kind of
    afterworld-bridging Beatles reunion any day now.  It's hard to tell
    exactly what he's doing or playing on <em>Murray Street</em>, but for
    the stop/start bassline of ""The Empty Page"" alone he's a valuable
    addition.  Hardcore fans may resist his presence like baseball
    traditionalists despise interleague play, but <em>Murray Street</em>
    is good enough to mercifully displace memories of the band's wobbly
    first steps with the omnipresent O'Rourke on <em>NYC Ghosts &amp;
    Flowers</em>.</p><p>
    
    At the very least, the perplexing twenty-years-along addition of a
    fifth member seems to have given the Youth just the kick in the ass
    they needed to stop making merely good albums that hit with segments
    of the fan population and get back to making great ones that resonate
    with everybody.  Journalistic integrity aside, it gives me great
    pleasure to be able to like a new Sonic Youth album without having to
    force it, and to finally give their back catalog a nice, long rest.
    You can bet your hat there's gonna be Jeremies who say <em>Murray
    Street</em> isn't far-out enough, and Ericas who would prefer the band
    kept things under four minutes, but a whole lot of in-between folk
    are going to be pleased as punch with the results.</p></div>"|7343.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7343-murray-street/|9.0|Rob Mitchum

    Clouds</em> have reached the level of myth.  For a week beforehand the
    band slept little, instead embarking on an epic binge fueled by
    psychotropic drug consumption.  Trailing off into hazy waking periods
    filled with lucid dreams, the musicians prepped themselves for the
    approaching chaos.  On the eve of the first night, a torrential
    thunderstorm arose, leaving the four landlocked in the studio amidst
    reports of flash floods and hail.  And after the tumultuous sessions,
    during which their producer collapsed in a nervous breakdown, an
    accident in the factory caused the vinyl lacquer to catch fire,
    torching most of the machinery and all but roughly 100 of the press
    run.  It seems the gods themselves had conspired to destroy Mirza's
    extraordinary epic.</p><p>
    
    Okay, so none of the above is true.  But if you have even a trace of
    drool dangling from your lips, you've been diagnosed with obsessive
    collector's syndrome.  The fetish for owning racks of rare records
    seems even less justified in these Internet days, when digital media
    pretty much ensures that a copy of just about any piece of music will
    live on in some form.  So you've got to wonder about the merits of
    any rarities collection-- does the material stand on its own as art,
    apart from the needs of sonic anthropology?  Case in point: <em>Last
    Clouds</em>, which actually collects a hard-to-find twelve-inch
    released by Mirza on their own label Autopia back in 1996, along with
    other previously unreleased jams.  Critics have been calling it the
    finest document of the now-defunct band, but the lo-fi noodling here
    smells a bit more like leftovers.</p><p>
    
    Mirza's four members included Glenn Donaldson on guitar and Steven
    Smith on drums, both of whom now feature prominently in California's
    Jewelled Antler collective.  Unlike the careful cadences of their
    work as Thuja, Mirza was all about loud, psychedelic rock.  The disc
    kicks off with ""Nostalgia,"" which accurately characterizes the
    feeling invoked as an epic peal of guitar suddenly bursts from the
    two-minute build.  The doorbell buzz of the bass guides the flight
    back down to a bed of cymbal crashes.  Echoes of Thuja can be heard
    on ""Charity,"" which moves at a slower, blissed-out cruise.  Donaldson
    drops ringing stalactites from his guitar, lulling the listener
    before the amped-up end section.  It glows like Mogwai's deceivingly
    contented moments, or even the Smashing Pumpkins' old live jams.</p><p>
    
    The first four songs (which comprised the original EP) were recorded
    on 8-track, bringing a satisfactory level of detail as well as the
    appropriately rough edges.  ""East,"" in particular, doesn't suffer at
    all-- the heavy pedal-fed guitar lines spiral around and around and
    eventually converge in cacophony.  But the other seven tracks are
    basically a handful of improvisations recorded on 2-track cassette
    between 1995 and 1998.  They're all extremely visceral and
    energizing, but the sound quality is poor and the atmosphere isn't
    much different from a Cul de Sac album.  Again, beneath all the fuzz
    and strange time signatures, this is essentially rock music, and you
    can expect each song to end in a freakout.  It's the ambling along
    the way that makes things interesting, as with the
    ghost-in-the-machine feedback on ""Pomegranate"" and the orange swaths
    of distortion colored by the tunings on ""Dust Crushed from a Moth.""</p><p>
    
    I'm most fascinated by ""Acts/Volcano of Birds,"" which seems to be two
    separate sections conjoined by tape edit.  The first absolutely
    blisters out of the speakers like a bizarre take on hardcore punk, or
    an attempt at covering <em>To Live and Shave in L.A.</em>  Still,
    eleven solid instrumentals won't make it to the top of many
    wishlists.  A lot of the musicians reading right now have probably
    done similar things in the studio and aren't rummaging through
    practice tapes looking to release a compilation.  <em>Last Clouds</em>
    will be a nice treat for psych-rock completists, but improv purists
    and others curious are encouraged to move right on to Thuja's two
    amazing albums.  Another option would be Steven R. Smith's recent
    solo album <em>Lineaments</em>, where the soundscapes are tempered by a
    greater degree of patience and silence.</p></div>"|5333.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5333-last-clouds/|6.8|Christopher Dare

Seven dollars.""  As a dirt poor student, the thought
    stung like hornets chasing the half-melted Big Kat bar in my cargo
    shorts.  Would the CD contain a coupon for a free egg at the local
    Faberge Hut?  Was it hand-etched?  I sighed.  One of the greatest
    triumphs (indirectly) of the Industrial Revolution had been that,
    thanks to the wonders of mass-production, I never had to pay more
    than, like, $1.50 per song-- until today.  Staring at the seven-dollar
    EP I held in my hands made that bygone era of child-labor, workplace
    fatalities, and people who lit cigars with C-notes (like the Monopoly
    Guy) seem like a wonderful, wonderful pipe dream.  Audiogalaxy!  Why
    hast thou forsaken me in my hour of need?</p><p>
    
    But, as the old saying goes, ""A fool and his money are soon parted
    for the new <em>Tremulant</em> EP by The Mars Volta."" As I put down
    the greenbacks, these guys-- including Cedric Bixler and Omar Rodriguez
    of At the Drive-In fame-- instantly had one strike against them.  I'll
    be honest.  If the album sucked, paying seven dollars for three tracks
    would make it suck so much harder, and even if it were really good--
    $2.33 per song good-- three tracks would just be a tease.  I tossed
    and turned all night, imagining Bixler &amp; Co. having a friendly cash
    fight in their McDuck-like vaults, but then figured that if that were
    the case, they'd have been able to afford decent haircuts by now.
    Regardless, my expectations for this disc were high.</p><p>
    
    Skepticism struck first, but luckily, the thrashing, distorted guitar
    lacerations and numbing, effects-driven interludes on <em>Tremulant</em>
    form a pretty convincing counter-argument.  The influence of At the
    Drive-In is immediately evident, unsurprisingly, and The Mars Volta
    seems to pick up where their old band left off.  Gone are previous
    missteps like the awkward spoken-word beat poetry jams and all-out
    howling Bixler has been so prone to in days past, distilling their
    sound to its most brutal immediacy.</p><p>
    
    Ironically, The Mars Volta has a leaner, meaner edge despite the fact
    that almost half of this album's nineteen minutes are spent on
    aimless, noodling instrumental segments.  Funny enough, these have been
    touted as ""free-jazz entropy"" and ""like Can"" by the label's website,
    so logic says I, a contemporary indie thug, should like them.  Maybe
    even more than the other stuff.  But nope, you read right: aimless,
    noodling.  I mean that.</p><p>
    
    Aside from the two minutes of straight tape hiss that start the disc,
    ""Cut That City"" and ""Concertina"" manage to keep the solo-type material
    presentable, although the final minutes of ""Eunuch Provocateur"" nearly
    enter the dreaded realm of jam-band jackin' around.  The guitar
    interaction in these tripped-out effect-storms is often interesting and
    complex, and they're actually just fine within the scope of this EP,
    but they could easily drain all the vitality from the EP if it weren't
    for Jon Theodore's absolutely stellar drum work.  Even when <em>Tremulant</em>
    seems lost in a mire of screeching distortions and echo-pedaling, a
    constant undercurrent of desperate urgency is preserved by the frantic
    drive of Theo's shifting tempos.</p><p>
    
    The musical intensity is matched capably by Bixler's vocals, which
    have wisely been somewhat reined in; it's like having all the intensity
    of At the Drive-In with 20% less pretense.  He gives an impressive
    performance, but it's what he's saying that makes <em>Tremulant</em>
    really shine.  The content of the EP has a surprisingly global feel
    to it, and is a drastic departure from the personal trials and
    tribulations that formed the basis of his prior work.  In just three
    songs, topics range from urban stagnation to personal betrayal to
    political upheaval, while Bixler drops fifty-cent words like Martha
    Stewart's stockbroker on an inside-tip selling spree.  The strangely
    stream-of-consciousness composition makes phrases like ""The labefaction
    is venal"" and ""Neo-Caesaristic phallic ruins"" sound like excerpts from
    an unpublished Burroughs cut-ups project or a Mensa Mad Libs party,
    but amazingly, it works.</p><p>
    
    But be warned!  The <em>Tremulant</em> EP gets an even 7.0-- one for
    each dollar I paid for it-- by virtue of quality, but I still wish
    I had a month's supply of ramen instead.  But hey, if you simply must
    keep tabs on the latest ATDI projects, the nervy, tension-filled
    grooves and hooks should satisfy.  Just know that this EP heralds
    good things on the horizon, and wait patiently for the sixty-dollar
    full-length.</p></div>"|5116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5116-tremulant-ep/|7.0|Eric Carr

    Jelinek, because he claims to be influenced more by painting than
    music. It's not hard to imagine Jelinek's music as the aural
    equivalent of a Rothko canvas-- clear geometric structure made soft
    and ambiguous through warm tone, blurred hue, and an exacting sense
    of detail.  As Jelinek has made albums under his own name and as
    Gramm (derived from 'kilogram'), he's continued to release EPs under
    the name Farben, and the good folks at Klang Elektronik have been
    kind enough to collect some of highlights as <em>Textstar</em>.</p><p>
    
    This nine-track CD draws material from the EPs <em>Farben Featuring
    the Dramatics</em>, <em>Beutone</em>, <em>Raw Macro</em>, and <em>Farben
    Says: Don't Fight Phrases</em>.  An expanded vinyl set called
    <em>Starbox</em> contains all the original EPs, complete with a total
    of six tracks not on the CD.  Yet, despite this being a collection of
    material from previous releases, Jelinek's sonic style is so distinct
    and consistent that <em>Textstar</em> feels like a singular work.</p><p>
    
    The borders are porous, but generally speaking, Jelinek uses Farben
    to represent his most upbeat, danceable music, the stuff that would
    fit nicely under the heading 'microhouse.'  Most of the tracks here
    have a house foundation, usually a sub-bass kick drum deep enough to
    blow the speakers in Luke Skyywalker's Jeep paired with a high-hat
    cast from a tiny scrape of static. The tracks have a structure much
    closer to pop music than Jelinek's later work, with variations that
    seem analogous to the verse/chorus/bridge/chorus template, and short
    melodic phrases that could be best described as riffs. Tying it all
    together is a supremely dubby production philosophy, where each sound
    is endlessly tweaked and filtered until it serves the overall design
    of the track.</p><p>
    
    Despite the consistently bare-bones approach of the sound, Jelinek
    always keeps things interesting.  He has an uncanny ability to make a
    handful of sounds do an enormous about of work.  Rhythmic, textural
    and melodic elements are handled by an array of squelches, clicks,
    and washes, all anchored by wall-rattling bass. The instruments are
    juggled into compositions that seem constantly in motion.  Unlike an
    artist such as SND, Jelinek's songs are loose, wet, rubbery and
    unpredictable, unfolding according to some odd internal logic.</p><p>
    
    Take ""Beautone."" After an intro comprised of a slightly awkward
    rhythm tapped on a virtual woodblock, a commanding house beat takes
    over.  The bass is a squelchy 303 that seems to be running in
    unpredictable circles around the programming, and the chords just
    might be the ghosts of some Hammond organ Jelinek pulled off one
    of his jazz records.  A couple of minutes in, a sample of an
    easy-listening wash of strings and flute punctuates the chorus,
    providing the track with a disorienting and humorous twist that
    nonetheless seems like it was designed to fit into this precise
    spot.</p><p>
    
    Another dizzying but funky track is ""Live at the Sahara Tahoe, 1973""
    (titled after the Isaac Hayes live LP). Several elements each seem to
    be keyed into their own separate, but complimentary rhythms: a
    churning synth loop and sampled cymbal lag slightly behind the crisp
    beat; an electro-inspired breakdown of faint laser-gun sounds repeats
    for two bars and never returns; a gorgeous orchestral sample, heavily
    processed and seemingly beamed in from another dimension, forms the
    track's emotional core.</p><p>
    
    By contrast, ""Farben Says: So Much Love"" is Jelinek at his sleekest
    and most elegant.  The deep, sensual bass hammers home an elastic
    riff of pure technofunk, and the microscopic high-hat is like the
    smallest possible unit of what can be considered a sound.  Between
    these sonic poles is an ever-shifting pool of warm chords, off-beat,
    jazz-inspired rhythm accents executed on glitchy percussion, and a
    sexy, whispered female voice saying something about getting a
    haircut.</p><p>
<i>Textstar</i> is a sonic feast if you want to dissect the myriad
    timbres and underlying structure, but you'll probably just want to
    turn off your mind and dance.  And that's alright.  Either way, it's
    clear that Jelinek is one of the most inventive producers working in
    this field today.  This compilation is a must-own.</p></div>"|2993.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2993-textstar/|9.5|Mark Richard-San

    desolate nighttime streets of suburbia will always echo with music--
    just as sure as they will never truly be desolate. After all, what's
    a suburb without a legion of teenagers cruising the well-trimmed
    boulevards-- numbed by boredom, aimless but intent, their windows
    rolled down and their stereos cranked to overcome the rushing noise
    of the wind hitting their faces?  Imperial Teen sound a lot like those
    suburban young'uns: aimless but intent, satisfied with what they've
    got but longing for more. And though they haven't gone so far as to
    tell me so, it seems to me that they really want is to be the band
    blasting on repeat from some trapped teen's crappy stereo. They make
    music that's devoid of purpose and they're proud of it. Just like
    <em>The Big Lebowski</em>'s would-be nihilists and that dude with the
    mohawk that hangs in front of the White Hen smoking cloves, Imperial
    Teen want you to believe they don't give a shit about anything, but
    something about the delivery-- be it a glint in the eye or a hint of
    fire in the vocals-- betrays them.</p><p>
    
    The upbeat opener to <em>On</em>, the third record from ex-Faith No More
    keyboardist Roddy Bottum and friends, is a fast-paced ditty with a racing
    bassline complimented by simple, subtle guitar and female ""doo-be-doo's.""
    All four band members-- two girls, two guys-- trade off the lead vocals,
    each with a different take on the same quick, breathy delivery.  It's
    a race to the finish that sets a tone of urgency and import for the
    album that follows. Which is funny, because Imperial Teen spend most of
    <em>On</em> indulging a near-fatal case of apathy-- the kind that anyone
    whose formative years were spent wasting away in suburbia will know all
    too well.</p><p>
    
    Like the legions of lackadaisical teenagers wandering the fake neor
    streets, Imperial Teen is fed up to the point of madness with the
    seeming inconsequentiality of it all, yet comforted by the predictability
    and ease of suburban malaise.  A recurring theme of impassivity manifests
    itself again and again in lines like, ""Those who I speak of are my friends/
    Gentlemen and gentlewomen/ Can't wait for their lives to begin/ Oh so
    exciting then."" There's also a hint of uncertainty in the delivery-- or
    maybe it's a sarcastic nudge-- that suggests this scenario is more thar
    a little familiar to the members of Imperial Teen.  <em>On</em> is filled
    with stories of people waiting for their lives to begin, about people too
    busy doing nothing to do much of anything, too content with the pointless
    parts of day-to-day life to seek an overall purpose.</p><p>
    
    The band adds yet another layer of irony by employing upbeat,
    catchy-as-they-come melodies to these detached, dogged narrations.
    The band's sound hasn't changed much since 1999's <em>What Is Not to
    Love</em>, save the addition of a few acoustic guitars and drum
    machines.  Imperial Teen is still all about the upbeat melodies, the
    Pixies-flavored basslines, lots of backup female vocal harmonizing,
    and lustful, throaty vocals that border on self-parody. But it's
    effective, and the able production by Anna Waronker (ex-That Dog) and
    Steve McDonald (Redd Kross) beefs up the sugary tightness of their
    sound.</p><p>
    
    While much of the album leans toward typical rock song clichés (songs
    about wanting someone, losing someone, or loving someone) there are
    moments where uncertainty comes into play.  Like any young, wistful
    suburbanite, Imperial Teen find themselves perplexed and intrigued by
    sex and issues of sexuality, and they take a small bit of pride ir
    their confusion.  On ""Million $ Man,"" a self-proclaimed perfect catch
    reads off a list of accomplishments and wonders why he's alone; or
    ""My Spy"" Schwartz delivers lines like, ""We are partners in crime/
    You're always the bride.../ You don't have to decide until it's light,""
    and, ""You're dating boys but you have a girlfriend on the side.""</p><p>
    
    The only true passion here is for apathy itself. On ""Captain,"" Schwartz
    &amp; Co. simultaneously reject both the importance of the world around them
    and the possibility of success and fame as a music-making unit,
    matter-of-factly stating, ""On the possibility/ Of us making history/
    Let the captain choose the teams/ I'm not as worried as I seem.""
    Sure, we've all heard a thousand songs like these before, but
    Imperial Teen aren't about innovation; they're about appreciating
    the ordinary, even as you long for something more.  There are no
    bells and whistles here; no lyrics of colossal world-shattering
    importance.</p><p>
    
    Yet <em>On</em> succeeds not in spite of its simplicity, but because of
    it. Imperial Teen are happy with what they do, they're good at it.
    It's fulfilling for them, yet they're too human not to long for
    something more. This is music best suited for drive-thru drive-throughs
    and unchanging landscapes of strip malls and condos.  Or better yet,
    for lying in the last pure patch of undeveloped land left in your
    suburban wasteland of choice, staring at the stars and pondering your
    own inability to do anything about the forward march of progress.</p></div>"|4082.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4082-on/|7.7|David M. Pecoraro

It's the
    drugs, man.  Chiefly, the folks who used to trip the visions fantastic
    via brown ones and orange ones have mellowed out on a cannabis tip.
    Freak-outs have been replaced by blissful highs, and acid flameouts
    like Brian Wilson's and Syd Barrett's have been replaced by stoner
    warlocks like Yume Bitsu and Richard Youngs. Or, if the hemp weed
    isn't your thing, just try slacking a bit more and take it easy.
    Today's psychedelic experience is peace, love and very, very slow
    tempos.  And it can be a beautiful thing, brother.</p><p>
    
    Nagisa Ni Te is the main event for Japanese hippie-titan and Org
    Records head Shinji Shibayama.  Shibayama's been at it since the
    1980s, when he started playing hyped up dada-psych with Idiot O'Clock
    and the more toned-down Hallelujahs.  Well before mystic folk became
    fodder for VW commercials, Shibayama was conjuring up the spirits of
    Tim Buckley and Tim Hardin to the delight of the Japanese psychedelic
    scene. Nagisa Ni Te carries on that tradition, opting for natural highs
    and frequent moments of naïveté via slightly out-of-tune vocals and
    perfectly amateur acoustic guitar dedications.  Shibayama started the
    band as a solo venture, but has gradually included his girlfriend
    Takeda Masako and various percussionists, as well as working with
    members of Eastern psych powers Maher Shalal Hash Baz.</p><p>
<em>Feel</em> is the band's fourth album, and is generally a step in a
    clearer direction, even if its relative clarity never really threatens
    to push the music into mainstream realms.  The instrumentation is quite
    full, featuring guitar, percussion, classic Leslie organ and group
    vocals to emphasize general communal harmony. All of the lyrics are ir
    Japanese, and all of the songs are very slow, so any disorienting
    sensations you experience here might be due to more than just the
    forest green haze (which radiates not just from the rather gorgeous
    cover).</p><p>
    
    Opening epic ""The New World"" starts things with a brief brainfreeze,
    as feedback guitar and backwards cymbals introduce a very earnest
    ballad-dirge.  Pixie-vocalist Masako carries the solemn tune, as
    Shibayama strums his guitar and provides distant backing vocals.  The
    prevailing mood is quite close to low-key Sigur Rós, or any number of
    symphonic post-Floyd balladeers.  Masako never even attempts to
    inject any extraneous passion into the song, and comes across as
    being completely content to drag alongside her partner in carefree
    melancholy.  When the mellotron strings come in, things take a turr
    for the spacey, but the fact remains this is pretty peaceful stuff.</p><p>
    
    ""Strength of the Wind"" pulls out all the retro stops, pumping up the
    mandolin and Leslie switches to summon the ghosts of the Small Faces
    and The Band, while simultaneously staying true to Nagisa Ni Te's
    folkish roots.  This time, Shibayama takes the lead, and his modest
    tenor is a bit more confident, though never more aggressive than a
    child of nature should be.  It's still a dirge, and when the ocarina
    comes in, straight out of Sherwood Forest, medieval chanson becomes
    the mode of choice.  The backing vocals are still quite thick, and
    though the clear stereo separation betrays the modern recording, this
    tune could have been performed exactly as it appears here any time ir
    the last 35 years.</p><p>
    
    Since most of the tunes share the same basic feeling of molasses-lader
    harmony, small variations tend to stick out.  ""Morning Glory"" plays
    up the haunting triangle resonance and the elastic slide-guitar
    accompaniment; ""Speed of Fish,"" featuring the Boredoms' Seiichi
    Yamamoto on 'seaweed guitar,' emphasizes the pattering percussion and
    ambient overtones floating around the band.  Closer ""Stars"" features
    a full ensemble of dual drummers, guitars, piano, mandolin and Leslie
    organ, and is probably the closest to an uplifting anthem as you'll
    find on <em>Feel</em>.  Shibayama sings of the ""ancient light of stars""
    and ""gazing at the retreating sail"" of some distant ship over music
    that is emotional without ever becoming maudlin.  Reference points
    might be solo George Harrison or, again, Sigur Rós or early Small
    Faces, but the story is the same: benign psych-folk can cure your
    ills, and if it doesn't, at least it's got a shot at curing your
    insomnia.  That's not an insult, but you should know Nagisa Ni Te
    are quite comfortably numb.</p></div>"|5698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5698-feel/|7.6|Dominique Leone

    a tremulous, bellowing voice, melodramatic lyrics, and disquieted,
    impatient orchestration. It's an edgy enough sound she's procured,
    and she deserves her share of props for solid execution. Despite
    owning the trademark sound, though, Wright does blend quite
    appropriately into the clichéd pantheon of bitter songstresses
    (a la Fiona Apple without the collagen, or Tori Amos without the
    mental instability and drag-queen mascara).</p><p>
    
    Despite Wright's dispossession, she is by no means without a home.
    Undoubtedly, there's a place in this world for her, and to some
    ears, I'm certain <em>Dyed in the Wool</em> is sheer (shear?) brilliance.
    These people are likely those who empathize with Wright's self-conscious
    acrimony and enjoy marinating in other peoples' distress or wallowing
    in their own.</p><p>
    
    So, as you might imagine, Wright delivers some pretty thick lyrics.
    On ""A Vessel for a Minor Malady,"" for example, Wright yelps: ""There's
    no cure so why should I care/ You have fled into this blackness/ Ir
    this sling I must contain."" There's plenty of that sort of dense,
    oblique poeticism in effect on just about every track, but it's
    balanced with more direct stuff, like on ""Hinterland"": ""Hinterland,
    I shall descend/ Hinterland, I crumble within.""  As long as the
    very mention of the word ""hinterland"" doesn't make you retch, and
    you can get past the 'descending/crumbling' metaphor this song
    shares with so much high school poetry, you may enjoy <em>Dyed ir
    the Wool</em>.  Perhaps too much.</p><p>
    
    As for orchestration, Shannon Wright has definitely found the formula
    to match her attitude. The music mimics the dramatic effect of the
    lyrics, painting bleak, uneasy portraits of distance and resentment.
    Minor key piano vamps and mournful string accompaniments are
    especially prominent, as are guitars-- both acoustic and electric,
    either arpeggiating chords or providing shrill melody with treble
    up the ass.  Wright's backing band (including members of Rachel's,
    the Rock *A* Teens, the Boxhead Ensemble, and Edith Frost) actually
    does a fine job, and with the engineering assistance of Andy Baker
    and Steve Albini, the overall sound is solid and striking, albeit not
    exactly soothing to the ears (it's fair to say that the music here is
    'difficult,' even while the lyrics are most certainly not).</p><p>
    
    The axis on which this album turns likely rests in your brain. Do you
    buy the schtick?  The melodrama, I mean.  Do you empathize with
    Wright's pain?  Are her lyrics convincing to you?  Can you handle
    high notes with maximum vibrato? Perhaps more importantly, have you
    recently been used by an asshole with a Y chromosome?  Answer 'yes'
    to a few of these questions, and you may have yourself a winner. For
    a good chunk of humanity, though, this album is just as likely to be
    frustrating as it is therapeutic.</p></div>"|8744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8744-dyed-in-the-wool/|6.7|Brad Haywood

    indie-rock Peter Pan-- with a beer gut.  Though he was already well
    past the age of 98% of his audience by the time <em>Bee Thousand</em>
    was released, his music carried with it a kind of child-like
    enthusiasm and appreciation that set it apart from the pack of whiny
    'alternative' rockers.  It's easy to imagine Pollard, way back in
    1993, sitting in front of his four-track, staring with determination
    at the cover of <em>Who's Next</em> and thinking to himself, ""One day,
    I'll be able to use a <em>real</em> recording studio-- then I can be a
    <em>real</em> rock star!""</p><p>
    
    Four brilliant albums and countless excellent EPs later, Bob Pollard
    finally got to live out his rock star dream.  With TVT (Sevendust,
    anyone?) and herr jackass Ric Ocasek in his corner, Pollard finally
    had the resources at his disposal to make a shot at the big leagues.
    Unfortunately, it seems that Pollard was too busy with his shiny new
    toys to actually figure out something to do with them.  Thus, <em>Do
    the Collapse</em>, the last album by Pollard the man-child, bore all
    of the whimsy of his earlier works with none of the substance.</p><p>
    
    It's hard to imagine an experience more sobering (figuratively, at
    least) than your big break doing little more than pissing off the
    people who were sticking up for you way back when.  And to top it all
    off, Pollard went and pulled a Howard Stern, as domestic turmoil cast
    a more sinister light on his once-charming hedonism.</p><p>
<em>Isolation Drills</em>, though a more solid effort than its
    predecessor, marked the end of the child-like charm that Pollard
    had sprinkled throughout his earlier work.  Effortless hooks and
    fantastical storytelling gave way to chugging riffs and darker
    lyrics.  This new direction went over with a mainstream audience
    about as well as all of the band's older directions did, and Guided
    by Voices quickly found themselves off the label, before being
    scooped back up by their former boosters at Matador.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us to <em>Universal Truths and Cycles</em>.  To make a
    long story short, it's the best thing Pollard's done since <em>Mag
    Earwhig!</em>.  And while it doesn't recapture the magic of the
    Sprout-era Guided by Voices records, <em>Universal Truths and
    Cycles</em> marks the return of some of the most sorely missed
    qualities of early Guided by Voices: strong vocal melodies and
    refreshingly atypical song structures.</p><p>
    
    The album's 35-second opener, ""Wire Greyhounds,"" provides a brief
    high that's far too quickly brought down by ""Skin Parade,"" a song
    that relies on a jarring, barely interesting riff to take up the
    space surrounding the memorable chorus.  After this brief misstep,
    though, the album genuinely takes off, with the brief acoustic number
    ""Zap"" setting the stage for the album's two greatest songs.</p><p>
    
    ""Christian Animation Torch Carriers"" begins with a bit of melancholy,
    as Pollard harmonizes with himself over a simple yet compelling chord
    progression.  The band enters, building towards a thrilling climax
    that utilizes some of Pollard's most tried and trusted songwriting
    techniques.  The result is one of those inimitable moments where it
    sounds like Pollard, while sliding an open chord up and down the neck
    of his guitar, happened to stumble upon a perfect song.  While
    ""Christian Animation Torch Carriers"" does sometimes meander as it
    builds towards its explosive ending, ""Cheyenne"" wastes no time making
    its brilliance known.  Built around a lovely chord progression and
    developing towards an endlessly catchy finale, ""Cheyenne"" could
    easily be the most blissful Guided by Voices song since <i>Waved
    Out</i>'s ""Subspace Biographies.""</p><p>
    
    Aside from ""Cheyenne,"" there aren't any other tracks on <em>Universal
    Truths and Cycles</em> that unquestionably qualify as classics. ""Back
    to the Lake"" comes close, perfectly contrasting its rhythmically
    relentless drive with a simple, laid-back vocal melody. The slightly
    overlong ""Car Language"" marries Joy Division darkness with Sonic Youth
    guitar lines, reaching a great instrumental section with rapid-fire drums
    and squalling feedback.  Yet, other songs, like the minute-long ""The Ids
    are Alright"" and ""Factory of Raw Essentials"" meander in typical Pollard
    fashion without ever really registering.</p><p>
    
    At this point, it's clear that the days when Bob Pollard could effortlessly
    create perfect pop songs are gone. There's blood and sweat all over these
    songs-- even ""Cheyenne,"" this album's standout, contains a few moments of
    awkwardness, as Pollard chokes the song's melody with too many syllables.
    Still, <em>Universal Truths and Cycles</em> has more than its share of
    wonderful moments-- moments when the rock crunch of <em>Isolation Drills</em>
    blends seamlessly with the steady melodic sensibility of <em>Under the
    Bushes, Under the Stars</em> and the charming eccentricity of <em>Bee
    Thousand</em>.</p><p>
    
    So, Robert Pollard has grown up.  The question now is whether his
    newfound maturity will be able to replace the ambition and vivacity
    that came with his perpetual youth.  Whatever hopes he might have had
    of bringing his sweet rock and roll to the masses have been crushed,
    trampled, and stomped into the ground.  Thankfully, <em>Universal
    Truths and Cycles</em> suggests that Pollard may still have a few
    choice treats for those of us who are still paying attention.</p></div>"|3588.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3588-universal-truths-and-cycles/|7.6|Matt LeMay

    bands that sounded kind of like the Cranes-- bands whose sound and
    general aesthetic placed them somewhere between My Bloody Valentine
    and the Cocteau Twins.  And those bands were frequently played at the
    sort of parties I once imagined I would like to attend, where
    attractive young artistes with flawless skin hobnobbed under unusual
    lighting and talked about their conceptual art installations at the
    local gallery, while taking in considerable amounts of some archaic,
    yet highly literary drug, like, say, opium.</p><p>
    
    My enthusiasm for such gatherings has dwindled over the years, more
    or less in direct proportion with my attention span for ethereal
    pop.  However, I suspect that as we speak <em>Futuresongs</em> is
    soundtracking someone's monologue about the need for wider public
    support of performance art, as the demystified soul in the corner
    rolls her eyes and asks: ""Hey, is this the Cranes?  Are they even
    around any more?""</p><p>
    
    As it happens, the Cranes <i>are</i> still around, and though they've
    tweaked their sound to keep up with the times, vocalist Ali Shaw still
    sounds like she's inhaling enough helium to send her spiraling into
    orbit.  The Cranes have also included a handy lyric sheet to counter
    the claims that Shaw has been speaking in tongues for years. With some
    imagination, one can follow along with the printed words and almost
    believe the songs are written in a terrestrial language. Unfortunately,
    one discovers pretty quickly that without the incomprehensible vocal
    stylings, the lyrics are trite as shit.</p><p>
    
    You might expect a song titled ""The Maker of Heavenly Trousers""-- with
    its trancelike melody and placid, repetitive crescendos of guitar--
    to offer a little more than, ""I know that I'm gonna find something
    this time/ 'Cos I just made up my mind.""  Come on, that's a compelling
    enough title-- let's have a little elaboration!  But the lyrics aren't
    really the problem.  I mean, all apologies, but songwriting doesn't
    have to be brain surgery.  The Cranes started out pretty way back in
    the early 90s, but with the passing years they've shifted towards more
    typical alternative pop.  <em>Futuresongs</em> sends the Cranes into an
    odd niche, a more contemporary version of how they sounded in their
    heyday.  If you can imagine a musical scale with Boards of Canada on
    one end and Mazzy Star on the other, <em>Futuresongs</em> would fit neatly
    in the middle.</p><p>
    
    It sounds interesting, and in all fairness, <em>Futuresongs</em> does
    have its moments. By dispensing with a whole lot of traditional
    instrumentation and beefing up their electronic edge, the Cranes
    have effectively stopped sounding like a 'band,' and more like a
    producer/vocalist outfit with occasional loops of guitar.  The best
    tracks are the instrumentals (the blissed out ""Everything For"" and the
    eerie, string-enhanced Autechre-lite of ""In the Reeds""), and the songs
    where Shaw's idiosyncratic vocals work more as an instrument than a
    would-be narrative device.</p><p>
    
    Lyrics aside, there's nothing distinctly unappealing or half-assed
    about this album.  It's a smart, dreamy, well-produced ambient pop
    record that will likely appeal to aficionados of hipster transcendental
    meditation, sugary-sweet sex scenes in independent films, and, yeah,
    suburban art parties.  It just feels awfully familiar. If the early
    90s produced a significant number of bands that sounded like the old
    Cranes, it's pretty obvious that the last five years have created a
    regular glut of this stuff.  At the end of the day, will the Cranes
    be the band you remember as the electronic trailblazers of the early
    00's?  Doubt it.</p></div>"|1660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1660-future-songs/|6.6|Alison Fields

    last made music together.  Even during their original mid-70s
    partnership as the founders of Manchester's indomitable Buzzcocks,
    they didn't make very much music-- only one full album's worth of
    songs ever came out of their partnership before Devoto split and
    formed Magazine.  But what a great batch of songs those were, from
    the frustrated sexual rumble of ""Orgasm Addict"" to the insightful
    musings of ""Boredom.""  Shelley continued to front the Buzzcocks
    on and off for two decades, while Devoto wrapped up Magazine and
    dipped in and out of the music industry, ultimately ending up at a
    photography agency in the early 90s.</p><p>
    
    Now, long after the punk movement the two helped nurture in its
    infancy has been co-opted for the more scripted and watered-down
    theatrics of commercial-minded revivalists, Devoto and Shelley are
    back together with a brand new album.  Needless to say, expectations
    are high for a release like this-- the towering legacy of their
    original collaboration (coupled with the outstanding work each has
    done since they parted ways) amount to a pretty big cloud of
    expectation.</p><p>
    
    It's important, however, to remember not to let that cloud obscure
    the final product, because, after all, this isn't a Buzzcocks reunion,
    nor do the pair intend to visit past glories.  Rather, the duo seems
    to have simply felt like working together again, and you're not going
    to notice many musical similarities between the electronic throb of
    <em>Buzzkunst</em> (<em>kunst</em> is German for art, by the way) and the
    primal pounce of the <em>Spiral Scratch</em> EP.  Whereas the Buzzcocks
    drew from the pummeling attack of the Stooges and the noisy
    offhandedness of the Velvet Underground, Shelleydevoto is more indebted
    to the synth-driven end of the post-punk spectrum.  Think Shriekback,
    the Human League and Depeche Mode at their darkest and most frenzied,
    and you're just about there.</p><p>
    
    Of course, those are just reference points, as the Shelleydevoto
    never end up sounding completely like any of those bands.  First of
    all, Devoto's vocals are quite distinctive-- he hasn't lost a bit of
    the quirk and ease of delivery that he was gifted with early on in
    his career.  Secondly, Shelley's electronically sequenced arrangements
    are more given to chaos and dissonance than any of their likely
    influences, and his guitar playing is still razor-sharp and not
    afraid to cut.  It's not as though Devoto and Shelley haven't been
    in synth-pop territory before-- Devoto's late-80s duo Luxuria and
    Shelley's own solo work both anticipate a project like this.</p><p>
<i>Buzzkunst</i> doesn't exactly offer any revelatory music, but it
    certainly is good, sometimes even great.  Devoto's panache as a
    vocalist certainly helps things a lot, and the duo's smart enough
    to realize that they work best together when the music moves at
    high speeds.  They burst out of the gate with the Kraftwerk-on-uppers
    groove of ""Can You See Me Shining?""  Devoto's melody is superb,
    setting up some wonderful tension in the chorus before releasing it
    with swooping, melismatic passages.</p><p>
    
    The shiniest gem in the bunch is ""Til the Stars In His Eyes Are
    Dead,"" with its driving synth-punk rhythms, atonal guitar workouts,
    and a spooked delivery from Devoto that picks up right where Magazine
    left off.  ""Self-Destruction"" lands the two on the dancefloor at a
    demented rave, with backing vocals from Kay Hoffnung coolly playing
    foil to Devoto's multi-tracked weirdness.  Shelley's drum programming
    is at its best, fluidly switching between frantic beat patterns to
    support Devoto's ear-friendly melody.</p><p>
    
    Alongside such successes, though, are a few tracks that don't work
    quite as well-- especially the instrumentals sprinkled through the
    disc.  Though not exactly bad, none of them really do much for the
    album, with the possible exception of ""On Solids,"" featuring Harrison
    Smith's soprano and tenor saxes.  The new texture is a nice
    interjection for the middle of the album and helps to brighten an
    otherwise fairly dark mood.  More generally, some of the home-recorded,
    sequenced backgrounds occasionally sound a bit limp, especially when
    Devoto gives his most passionate delivery on top.</p><p>
    
    Still, I personally take some relief in the fact that Devoto and
    Shelley haven't made <em>Spiral Scratch II</em> or tried to replicate
    their past from the pieces that are still left.  If I want to hear
    the magic of the original Buzzcocks, I can just go listen to
    ""Breakdown.""  What I have here is an honest, uncompromised record
    that also happens to be pretty damn good.  It honors Shelley and
    Devoto's considerable history together and brings two of punk's
    most original voices back on convergent paths.</p></div>"|7108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7108-buzzkunst/|7.0|Joe Tangari

About a
    month before I ever heard The Six Parts Seven's latest LP, the band
    played a rock and roll show there, opening for Denison Witmer.
    ""They were good kids, I liked their music"" she would later comment,
    ""but they need a singer.""</p><p>
    
    Although not exactly among the indie-cognoscenti, I took my friend's
    comment as a critique of post-rock more generally. The genre has
    seemingly become the catch-all term to describe rock without words
    (excepting, of course, bands like Gastr del Sol). But when one
    pigeonholing buzz word manages to rope both Don Caballero and Sam
    Prekop, its descriptive utility is obviously suspect.  Avoiding a
    general critique of post-rock, though, allow me simply to pare it
    down a bit: The Six Parts Seven play delicate, subdued post-rock
    a la Rachel's or the Album Leaf. There-- is that better?</p><p>
    
    Unlike many who have traveled the same course, The Six Parts Seven
    avoid the dreaded curse of droning boredom, executing their craft
    with a surprising and beautiful depth.  Compositions are generally
    guitar-based, formed from simple hooks and patterns repeated
    hypnotically.  On most tracks, the guitar hooks manage to sidestep
    at some point, allowing for variation in a bridge or interlude,
    or perhaps reprieve with a piano melody (as on ""Sleeping Diagonally""
    and""Where Are the Timpani Heartbeats?""). The guitar driving the melody
    is accompanied by a second axe playing background counterpoint.  The
    band also makes tasteful use of samples, as on ""Spaces Between Days
    (Part 4),"" where something that sounds like a bagpipe in reverse
    occupies the guitar's usual drone, repeating the same six-note patterns
    throughout.</p><p>
    
    The compositions on <em>Things Shaped in Passing</em> are uniformly
    tender, reflective, and soothing-- the sort of record to soundtrack a
    Sunday slumber, or induce the same.  There's something very personal
    about the music, something evocative in the simplicity that invites
    closeness. It's really quite stunning.</p><p>
    
    Yet, although the parts are strong, the album as a whole still comes
    up somewhat short since each track approximates the tempo and mood of
    its immediate predecessor.  It's as if The Six Parts Seven decided to
    write an absolutely perfect song for one occasion, then recorded
    slight variations on its theme eight times.  As a result, I'd recommend
    you either take <em>Things Shaped in Passing</em> in small bites, or
    listen for a few tracks and let it dissolve into the background.  Still,
    I'll contend that they do just fine without a singer, and that they've
    managed to create a pretty solid outing considering the current
    post-post-rock climate of independent music.</p></div>"|7204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7204-things-shaped-in-passing/|7.8|Brad Haywood

While     Connors' work varies in style, he's a master of quiet, meditative pieces     for electric guitar, and this is his approach on <i>The Departing of a Dream</i>.</p>
<p>The makeup of the music is simple enough. Connors' guitar receives some     reverb and equalization, the latter mostly a gentle roll off the high end,     imparting a distinctly sub-aquatic tone. He makes disorienting use of the     wah-wah pedal, deploying it much as Miles Davis did, to destabilize long,     drawn-out phrases. And then there are some assorted effects, scraping sounds     as such, added for color. Enhancing the unsettling atmosphere, the album was     recorded in a very 'natural' environment, with plenty of room noise and tape     hiss, and with the VU meters well up into the red, lending the glow of analog     distortion to what is essentially a very sparse record.</p>
<p>This is without question one of the most focused and single-minded records     you are ever likely to hear. Containing ten tracks of slow, murky electric     guitar tones, the mood never budges from the intersection of dread, sadness     and exhaustion, and varies only in relative intensity. Describing individual     tracks is pointless, as they sound so similar (the first eight are titled     ""The Departing of a Dream,"" the last two are a NYC 9/11 tribute called ""the     Silence"" and ""and Sorrow."") The record can only be taken whole.</p>
<p>In Connors' favor, it's incredible how palpable an atmosphere he can conjure     with so few ingredients. The word 'alien' is overused in music discourse     these days, but no other word can describe the uncanny setting of <i>The     Departing of a Dream</i>. It truly feels beamed from another realm, a blurry,     dizzying world of grainy black-and-white images and suspended time. The     guitar phrasing occasionally hints at melody, but in a way that feels closer     to speech than singing, almost like a six-string recitation of a Gregorian     chant. Chords are few; hell, notes are few, gently tumbling out every second     or so.  This music sounds like meditation.</p>
<p>And that's important to note. This album comes from and is geared toward     solitude more than any album in recent memory; it almost seems obscene that     this might be listened to by more than one person at a time. An album so     completely gripped by a crushing sense of loneliness should probably carry     some kind of warning label, to turn away people who actually socialize. In     any case, this beguiling record is definitely a specialty item.</p>

    with ten-gallon 'skypieces' and oversized rose-tinted shades, a place where grandparents could still find a
    <i>Butch Cassidy</i>-style bar brawl and desert creatures fought over passing Dodge Rams for the sweet mercy
    of an air-conditioned afterlife.  Can you still feel the ghostly wind of J.R. Ewing blow through the very
    fabric of your being in downtown Dallas?  Wouldn't be Texas without it!  You can even sense his spirit
    mingling with the stink of sun-dried horseshit on the open prairie, if you're bored enough.  Ahh, but after
    all these years of proudly sustaining its stereotypes, Old Lone Star's finally ready to contribute something
    worthy of the endless expanse it so greedily hogs.</p><p>
    
    The past couple years have seen countless unknowns barreling out of Texas' scorched earth, like the
    bloodthirsty groundworms lunging for Bacon gristle in <i>Tremors</i>: Lift to Experience brought religious
    fanaticism to Spiritualized guitars; Stars of the Lid breathed hypercolor cinematography into stagnating
    ambient drones; and our boys in the Trail of Dead built a monument to indie's darkest string-shredders,
    delivering such visceral elysium it earned them their very own caravan of Deadheads.  Folks haven't seen
    that kind of loyalty in those parts since Pee-Wee gumshoed for his hijacked Schwinn at the Alamo.</p><p>
    
    But it gets better with Secret Machines' freshly issued debut, which at last pushes America's waning
    psych-pop movement beyond the four-tracked Beatles bounce of the Elephant 6 crew.  The trio draws from the
    same pool of influences that informs the Flaming Lips' recent work, and shares Wayne Coyne's talent for
    rapturous melodies.  But where the mighty Lips rarely veer from psych-pop traditionalism, Secret Machines
    spend as much quality time with extended instrumental passages as they do with instantaneous pop hooks.</p><p>
    
    Secret Machines aren't completely innocent of the jam-band aesthetic that's colored so much of
    psychedelia's fluorescent history; they build repeating patterns and layer effects in crescendos taller
    than Chase Tower.  Fortunately, these moments never come off like academic experiments in drum-circle
    theory or languid, aimless noodling.  The band prefers a more engaging and concise approach to their epic
    sound collages-- these beasts never run past the four-minute mark, and all of them burst into glorious
    pop songs sooner or later.  There's not even an ambling tabla/oud/sitar setup to contend with-- just the
    creative deployment of comfortably conventional instrumentation and textured sci-fidelity backdrops.  But
    let's get hypothetical and imagine that these kind of build-ups aren't your cup of Godspeed.  Hey, great!
    Those only comprise about a fifth of the disc's 28-minute runtime; the rest is a triumph of classic indie
    rock tradition: tuneful immediacy, thundering choruses, and forward-thinking ingenuity.</p><p>
    
    Recorded at Chicago's Clava Studios with producer Brian Deck, Califone guitarist Tim Rutili, and drummer
    Ben Massarella, <i>September 000</i> sparkles with the intensity of the rhinestone bling the Secret Machines'
    Dallas hometown built its oil-playboy rep on.  Some of Deck's recent work is marred by digital
    over-processing, but the subtle effects that underscore this record achieve a largely organic space-rock
    sound.  Chiming keyboard tones communicate with the inventive creaks and whispers uttered by Ben Curtis'
    treated guitar, adding an abyssal depth to the hummable pop gratification that gives the disc its magnetic
    pull.</p><p>
    
    Two songs titled ""Marconi's Radio"" bookend the record.  The opener builds from a sparse, repeating
    keyboard figure into a squalling burst of dense noise before U-turning into a beautifully arranged ballad
    where Josh Garza's taut, snapping drumkit collides with Brandon Curtis' plaintive vocals.  The second
    version is a shorter, upbeat instrumental variation with chaotic junkyard percussion and intricate
    multilayers of ear-candy adornment.  As sounds are piled on, the track quickly builds to a frenzied upset,
    and the rhythmic handclaps that punctuate its spirited melody erupt into enthusiastic applause.  ""What Used
    to Be French"" is more immediate, with its pulsing bassline, wailing guitars and explosive chorus, but the
    three-minute burner ""Breathe"" comes away the clear winner-- a raucous, energetic pop basher that contends
    with (and to a large degree, sounds like) the best moments of the New Pornographers' <i>Mass Romantic</i>.</p><p>
    
    The Secret Machines recently relocated to New York City, presumably because they were tired of people
    referencing the Ewing dynasty in their reviews.  But they're proud of their Texan heritage, and they should
    be.  Life is finally emerging from its cracked soil, and I'm taking this disc as a sign that this new scene's
    prepared to produce enough great music to finally scrub the Fabulous Thunderbirds' greasy prints off the
    pop culture cerebellum.  Grab those brushes, men, ""Tuff Enuff"" ain't coming off without a fight.</p></div>"|7056.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7056-september-000/|8.4|Ryan Schreiber

    their last.  It's a word inherently filled with panic and dread,
    originally descending from the French m'aider-- literally ""help me.""
    It's certainly never a good thing to hear it coming over your radio,
    as it means death might be just around the corner for whoever's out
    there in the air or on the ocean calling it out.</p><p>
    
    The members of Mayday seem like an unlikely bunch to relate to a
    primarily nautical distress call, having spent the majority of their
    lives adrift in the oceans of grain that cover Nebraska and the rest
    of the Great Plains.  But frontman Ted Stevens has always seemed to
    view life itself as a vast ocean that we're simply cast into-- forced
    to struggle against currents and undertow, not to mention all the
    sinister surprises lurking in the depths.  During his tenure with
    breadbasket troubadours Lullaby for the Working Class, Stevens once
    referred to himself as a ""pale white torso, complete with two
    struggling oars,"" and it only seems fitting that the imagery of that
    line should come to the fore in his latest project, as that's what
    Mayday's music largely seems to address.</p><p>
    
    Since Lullaby had their final cadence, Stevens has gone on to become
    the guitarist for southeast Nebraskan post-punks Cursive, and
    musically, Mayday falls somewhere in between his two other bands,
    occasionally utilizing the rhythmic push that makes Cursive's music
    so urgent, but using it mostly to support the grandly humble gestures
    and ramshackle navel-gazing that characterized Lullaby for the
    Working Class.  His singing has come a long way since he first
    cracked and groaned his way through songs like ""Show Me How the
    Robots Dance"" half a decade ago.  Though there are still some rough
    spots, he sounds more confident on the microphone these days,
    displaying his widest expressive range ever.</p><p>
<em>Old Blood</em> fades in on ""Cinquefoils,"" with a pulsing electronic
    rhythm that's almost enough to make you wonder if Stevens and co.
    haven't given over to Depeche Mode-styled synth-pop.  The subtle,
    room-miked drums and banjo/guitar plucking that enter soon after,
    though, make it immediately clear that that isn't the case.  It's
    simply a broadening of a sonic pallet that was already pretty broad,
    and it's impressively well-integrated.</p><p>
    
    It's followed by the gorgeous ""Come Home,"" which moves gracefully
    from a slow ballad with male-female harmonies to a soaring climax.
    ""I'm trying to remember where I went wrong/ I only want to talk you
    into coming back/ I won't even ask you where you've been/ Or who
    you've been staying with,"" Stevens sings, as though staring out his
    window, watching some memory of domestic bliss.  After the second
    refrain, the tempo doubles and slide guitars rise up to meet the
    vocals as the song moves to its stratospheric heights before coming
    back down for one last plea of ""Come home, babe.""</p><p>
    
    ""Captain"" is an old school working-class lullaby complete with
    imagery of planes colliding with mountains and ships being tossed
    like toys in storms.  ""Lullaby for the Sleeping Elephant"" plays off
    the old Canadian saying that being adjacent to the U.S. is like
    ""sleeping next to an elephant,"" with its tale of parents sending
    their child off to war.  The anguished bridge turns the plodding
    tempo into sludge with dark, distorted guitars as Stevens hollers as
    though relating his own son's plight.</p><p>
    
    The band takes ample opportunity to spread their wings wide on songs
    like the tense ""Pilot,"" with its ominous opening line, ""The pilot is
    tapping the gauges.""  The song moves from claustrophobic verses to
    gorgeous, violin-led instrumental passages that play foil to the
    ragged nerves of the lyrics.  ""Confession"" drips with desert-fried
    guitar and loping, Latin-inflected rhythms that would feel right at
    home on a Pinetop Seven or Calexico record.</p><p>
    
    Most impressive, though, are the album's two suites, the meditative
    ""Tone/Atone/Atonal"" and the epic, twelve-minute closer ""Temple/Temporary/Extempore/Tempo.""
    ""Tone"" moves from a stark, minimal opening to tribal beats smothered
    with organ and smatterings of slide guitar, eventually building to
    a stormy ending.  ""Temple"" is an epic in the true sense, blossoming
    from an opening salvo of drones and dissonance into a complex series
    of freely composed verses full of shifting rhythms and textures.
    It's the rare twelve-minute song that earns its full keep without
    tossing in anything unnecessary.</p><p>
    
    Mayday have put together an impressive debut that's exceedingly
    difficult to pigeonhole.  Mike and AJ Mogis' recording is immaculate,
    yet dirty enough to make the sci-fi folk vibe work perfectly.  Mayday
    have turned the desperate cry for help into a thing of fragile,
    spontaneous beauty, and the result is stunning.</p></div>"|5161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5161-old-blood/|8.2|Joe Tangari

    Black Dog) gives the world a twenty-track intelligent techno
    appreciation of the essence of William Burroughs.  Aiding Downie in
    this meticulously wrought homage is performance artist/poet and
    fellow traveler on the Road to the Western Lands, Black Sifichi.
    Downie put together <em>Unsavoury Products</em> as he was constructing
    his as-yet-unreleased album featuring Burroughs himself.  But this
    album is far from just a bric-a-brac jumble.  <em>Unsavoury
    Products</em> shows that there's more to the Black Dog/Black Sifichi
    partnership than just a shared admiration for the darkest swatch in
    the Pantone color chart.  Neither takes center stage; free of ego,
    the pair allow the album to impart its provocative energy
    unhindered.</p><p>
    
    Avoiding gauche parody or drooling idolatry, Sifichi's spoken word
    contributions are unmistakably Burroughsian. Yet nowhere on
    <i>Unsavoury Products</i> can I justifiably accuse Sifichi of ripping
    off Burroughs' idiosyncratic delivery nor his emotionally distant
    factional narratives. In fact, Sifichi's voice sounds more like an
    amalgam of Ken Nordine and James Mason!</p><p>
    
    Sifichi possesses Burroughs' canny ability to present unreal
    phantasmagoric events as incontrovertible truth. From expositions
    on musical theory (""Let's Talk Music"") to enthusiastically goofy
    parodies of catalog shopping (""Inconspicuous Audiometric"") via comic
    routines in questionable taste (""Mental Health Hotline""), I find
    myself challenging Sifichi's narratives.  Is he really informing me
    of undisputable facts, or just yanking my chain?  Which is exactly
    how I respond to Burroughs' works.</p><p>
    
    Referencing the time Burroughs spent in Tangiers and Morocco in which
    he and Paul Bowles became devoted listeners of the mystical Master
    Musicians of Joujouka, Downie surrounds some of Sifichi's expositions
    of possible parallel realities in mock Arabic accents.  The prime
    example of this on <em>Unsavoury Products</em> is ""Dogbite,"" in which
    Downie introduces an oud and the Maghreb wail of a female devotee to
    his AI techno.</p><p>
    
    Downie's contribution is not all quarter-tones and ululations,
    though. ""Secret Biscuits"" and ""Interview"" nod to the industrial funk
    of Michael Franti's Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy and that act's
    collaboration with Burroughs, <em>Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales</em>.
    ""If I Were King"" is distinctly UK techno in origin, with spindly
    synth lines and Venusian jazz chords. But instead of constructing a
    Derrick May rhythm pattern, Downie surprises by dropping some dread
    hip-hop weight.</p><p>
    
    ""B4 The Sky Was Built"" is as dense as kif smoke and just as
    hallucinogenic-- indistinct voices mumble as trap drums beat out a
    dubby bassline.  A solo violin swoops through this disturbing vapor,
    bringing to mind the repetitive forms of waterless dunes.  Since the
    tinny ""Invisible Things"" sounds self-consciously like early-90s
    techno, I'm convinced Downie's joining Sifichi in kidding the
    listener, especially when he brings in the rinky-dinkiest vibraphone
    solo of all time. ""Science Tells Us"" takes the skippy rhythm of
    ""Invisible Things"" and transforms it into something far more serious.
    As the rhythm patters along, Downie surrounds it in twisting
    microtonal movements of primitive reed instruments to produce squalls
    not unlike feedback.  Buried in the mix, Sifichi's barely formed
    vocals populate the soundspace abandoned by sanity, driven
    unintelligible by the ceaseless cruelty of the desert sun.</p><p>
    
    Rather than bearing the offensive stench of rotting meat,
    <em>Unsavoury Products</em> is a heady blend of spices and aromas.
    However, I find that it's often too much for me to take in one
    sitting.  This is more a criticism of me than of Downie and Sifichi.
    But if I'm to give this album its due, I can't just put it on in the
    background and potter about my business.  It demands undistracted
    concentration.  For <em>Unsavoury Products</em> is a fascinating and
    multi-layered album, and one the Black Dog will have to enlist the
    wildest of Interzone trippers to better.</p></div>"|753.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/753-unsavoury-products/|8.7|Paul Cooper

If you're one of
    those crazy optimists who went for the latter, boy, do the Lucksmiths
    have an album for you. <em>Where Were We?</em> foams with the
    effervescence of summer, yet it's lightly soured with the melancholy
    of slipping into autumn.  The lads get girls and lose them; they have
    a pleasant evening at the pub, but the local football team loses a
    match.  It's an album-- hey, a life-- of light highs and okay lows.
    And did I mention that the weather's great?</p><p>
    
    This Australian trio follows a tradition going back to Chad &amp; Jeremy
    in the 60s, singing ""A Summer Song"" to your mom on her 45 player.
    The Lucksmiths have a small but manic batch of fans, and not many
    people do the folky acoustic pop thing this well.  They're often
    compared to tourmates Belle and Sebastian, and it's a toss-up which
    band sounds more sensitive and fey.  The Lucksmiths are sharper, and
    more into rhythm than color: Tali White's vocals sound wistful, but
    they're also jockishly sturdy and clear, and his drums lock into
    Marty Donald's jangly acoustic and Mark Monnone's limber bass like
    a one-band argument for a Merseybeat revival.</p><p>
    
    Depending on your taste, this may sound intriguing.  But <em>Where
    Were We?</em> is a bad place to start with this band-- a compilation
    of slim rarities, this record collects fourteen singles, tracks
    from comps, and gimmick songs.  The title talks about all the
    travel that took place while they made this-- the material was
    recorded over three years and three continents-- but from the songs,
    you'd think they never left the mythical Aussie town where they grew
    up and plan to die.  The album is catchy and crisp; good enough to
    show why people like the band, but the material isn't there.</p><p>
    
    Out of context, there's nothing to like about ""The Cassingle
    Revival,"" which was originally released in that much-maligned format.
    White opens the song with, ""Another summer slipped away without me
    noticing,"" and a little later he's talking about ""the palest
    afternoons"" of autumn on the dull ""A Downside to the Upstairs.""  And
    just when you've heard enough about the climate, the album's big
    frenzied peak announces it's ""T-shirt weather!"" </p><p>
    
    That song is so bright and bursting that it almost works, but for
    every catchy number like that there are two limp ones, dragged down
    by awkward rhymes, thin melodies, or shallow subjects.  Songs this
    breezy sound even more lightweight when they hang on something as
    simple as pop culture references or wistful nostalgia (""I Prefer the
    Twentieth Century,"" written for-- you guessed it-- a New Year's 2000
    single).  And when the otherwise winning shuffle of ""Myopic Friends""
    uses the phrase ""affaire du couer""-- or when they close ""Tmrw vs
    Y'Day"" with the line, ""If I don't see you in the future/ I'll see you
    in the pasture""-- they lose tangible amounts of dignity.</p><p>
    
    ""Southernmost,"" which first came out in a better version on <em>Happy
    Secret</em>, is the only song that doesn't feel like getting thwacked
    in the face by a balloon.  The genuinely poignant melody fits the
    relationship-gone-sour lyrics, with images from great vacations in
    the past: ""The sky was swimming-pool blue/ And the swimming pool was,
    too.""  It's an ode to summer memories that actually feels real, in
    the middle of songs that take the same sentiment and flog it to
    death.  <em>Happy Secret</em> is the only other Lucksmiths album I've
    spent time with and it's much subtler-- even recommended, if this
    sounds like your kind of warm-weather driving music.  But <em>Where
    Were We?</em> is strictly for the fans, and it's too bad that a band
    this obscure would take a chance on releasing it.</p></div>"|4907.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4907-where-were-we/|4.7|Chris Dahlen

    Departure Lounge (a band led by Tim Keegan, former member of Robyr
    Hitchcock's Egyptians) and überstoned French trip-hopper Kid Loco.
    Though the wisdom of the collaboration at first seems suspect, it
    turns out these guys knew what they were doing.  Most of the credit
    is due to Kid Loco, who apparently left his ego behind when he assumed
    the producer's chair.  There are some lovely gurgling electronic
    flourishes here and there, but nothing makes a bid for clubland,
    and Kid Loco clearly based his treatments on what their songs required,
    rather than going out of his way to leave his mark.  The album is warm,
    thick and lush, but firmly rooted in the guitar pop tradition.</p><p>
    
    With Loco steering the songs someplace interesting, the x-factor is
    the songwriting, which turns out to be first rate. The record's first
    step is a mighty one: opener ""Straight Line to the Kerb"" is such a
    killer song, there's no way the rest of the album could upstage it.
    Starting with a cloud of fluffy electronic noise, the tune turns into
    melancholy British guitar pop equal to the finest XTC, complete with
    the kind of trumpet that adds that extra layer of sadness to certair
    Belle &amp; Sebastian songs. It's among my favorite songs of the first
    half of 2002.</p><p>
    
    After that auspicious beginning, the dip in quality is slight but
    noticeable, as Departure Lounge draw from a variety of sounds and
    styles, with generally positive, but rarely brilliant results.
    Keegan's laconic delivery on the midtempo ""King Kong Frown"" is a
    dead ringer for Lloyd Cole, and ""I Love You"" is a wide-eyed Spectoriar
    extravaganza with a vocal arrangement indebted to Brian Wilson.  The
    instrumental ""Tubular Belgians In My Goldfield"" offers Kid Loco the
    rare indulgence, and he transforms a ho-hum guitar instrumental into
    an epic, proggy slice of trip-hop that could be a <i>Psycence Fiction</i>
    B-side.</p><p>
    
    ""Tubular Belgians"" segues into ""Be Good to Yourself,"" a bouncy pop
    song with a background of wailing free-jazz horns a la Radiohead's
    ""The National Anthem.""  ""The Good Side"" is a solid country-ish duet
    between Keegan and Sing Sing's Lisa O'Neill, rather in the vein of
    Mike Johnson's pairings with Tiffany Anders.  Mr. Hitchcock himself
    shows up for ""Coke &amp; Flakes,"" a bluesy, noisy, psychedelic shuffle
    that is ultimately directionless and boring.  The spare, affecting
    acoustic balladry of ""Silverline"" shows that Keegan's gifts are
    melodic, not rhythmic or instrumental.  The album is about a quarter
    filler, but the songs that hit on <em>Too Late to Die Young</em> make
    the tedium worth sitting out.</p></div>"|2280.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2280-too-late-to-die-young/|7.6|Mark Richard-San

    as a member of the famed Swedish avant-prog outfit Samla Mammas
    Manna.  Theirs was a particularly warm brand of out-there rock,
    especially as it took into account Scandinavian folk influences,
    polka and children's music as much as flashy instrumental virtuosity
    or the usual extraneous indulgences most people associate with prog.
    As bands of this sort go, they were actually quite popular in their
    native country, as well as having ties to Henry Cow and the
    gone-almost-as-soon-as-it-started Rock In Opposition collective.
    Fred Frith would use them as his backing band for much of his solo
    record <em>Gravity</em>, and after the demise of Samla (or more
    accurately, Zamla-- it's a long story), Hollmer started the
    short-lived Von Zamla ensemble, based on similar principles of
    carnivalesque folk melodies, improvisation and heady instrumental
    workouts.  Since then, he's released a series of accordion and
    keyboard-based solo albums, and even received Sweden's equivalent to
    a Grammy award.</p><p>
    
    Okay, so what I really need to tell you is to pick up some Samla
    records now.  Start with <em>Klossa Knapitatet</em> and <em>Maltid</em>,
    and then work your way through <em>Schlagerns Mystik</em> and
    <em>Famljesprickor</em>.  After that, check out Von Zamla, and
    possibly one of their side projects like Ensemble Nimbus. Enough?
    No?  Then you're in luck, because Hollmer's latest project, the
    Global Home Project, is one of his best.  The project features
    some of the best musicians in Japan's underground experimental
    underground (whom he met in Japan, playing Samla tunes as his touring
    band in that country), playing a mix of cinematic vignettes and
    good-natured avant-prog.</p><p>
    
    ""Nationsjazz"" begins things on a very hectic note-- a repetitive
    violin melody is doubled by clarinet, giving it a quasi-Klezmer
    feel-- pushing to the breaking point by Tatsuya Yoshida's manic
    percussion and Hollmer's completely in-control accordion.  The bridge
    opens the sound considerably as the melodies become more stretched
    out, and the clarinet (courtesy of de facto band organizer Wataru
    Okhuma) begins to wander into jazz-skronk territory now and again.
    If I had to pick a genre, I might go with circus-prog.  The very
    different ""Ljuva Lägen"" features a restless, sentimental piano line
    from Hollmer and a gorgeous violin melody played by Yuriko Mukoujima.
    The overall feeling is not unlike what you might hear in a colorful
    CGI-animated short about a love story between a bee and a fish or
    something-- it's superficially pretty, but also a bit juxtaposed, as
    the melodies are always pushed by Yoshida's drums and Hollmer's
    perpetually moving piano lines.</p><p>
    
    ""Continue"" features Hollmer's modest vocals over an elegantly
    propulsive arrangement featuring accordion, violin and clarinet.  The
    melody is at once reminiscent of modern Euro-ambiencd along the lines
    of Enya (in a good way, if that's possible) and the 19th century
    art-song of Franz Schubert.  Once again, the accordion serves as
    pulse keeper, and Yoshida is content to color around the edges with
    his cymbals as the violin plays descant to Hollmer's tenor.  ""Arp
    Violin"" keeps the classical motif running with its chamber group
    arrangement, airy violin melody and accordion ostinatos.  The entire
    record seems to have been mixed to simulate a stage performance--
    full of natural reverb and a great big ensemble sound.</p><p>
    
    My complaint with the record is not much to do with the songs
    themselves, but rather that Hollmer never really taps into the
    greatest strengths of his band to push the music into higher realms.
    For the most part, this is a very good Hollmer solo disc, though it
    might have been something incredible had he opened the floor to the
    group interaction that Samla used to do so well.  A tune like
    ""Parallel Angostura,"" with its angular figures and operatic baritone
    vocal lines, seems to have been written to suit Yoshida, though it
    comes out a tad on the rigid side because the musicians may be
    playing too close to the score.  On the other hand, those vocals are
    pretty great-- it's not as if anyone outside of the RIO bands ever
    played this stuff better anyway.</p><p>
    
    Again, you really should steal the first Samla disc you come across
    before diving in to this one-- though in the end, you can hardly go
    wrong with Hollmer.  I can honestly say he's the coolest
    accordion-prog-improv-circus-experimental-Nordic-folk-polka-all-around
    generally eclectic musician I've heard.  Can you really live without that?</p></div>"|3468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3468-sola/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    Flow.  The album's tense, hypercreative backdrops laid such a sturdy foundation
    for the underground hip-hop world that it still echoes five years later, and
    has since been widely recognized as one of the genre's greatest achievements.
    Unfortunately, after only a few additional singles and an instrumental album,
    Company Flow was officially sent off last year with a blistering farewell show
    in Boston.  And while El-P's remained busy with production work (most notably
    Cannibal Ox's <em>The Cold Vein</em>) and running a record label (the estimable
    Def Jux), heads have been hungry for the man to step back up to the mic.</p><p>
    
    Now, after a series of frustrating delays, El-P's finally kicked out his first
    solo LP and exceeded the expectations of everyone who anxiously awaited its
    arrival.  <em>Fantastic Damage</em> is an unrelenting, end-to-end burner that
    not only heralds the resurrection of El-P, but also provides a milestone for
    post-millennial underground hip-hop.  The music is carefully constructed and
    sonically intricate.  Distorted guitars, cacophonous, high-pitched ringing, and
    spiraling screams comprise its musical motifs.  Lyrically, El-P eschews hip-hop's
    straightforward style for fits of associative word clusters (a la Kool Keith,
    or even early Pavement) that sound like a freestyle battle between a Marxist
    pamphlet and a technical manual.  ""Motherfucker, does this sound abstract?""
    El-P howls on one early track. ""I hope that it sounded more confusing than that.""</p><p>
    
    Like <em>Funcrusher Plus</em>, the themes on this album are predominantly political.
    ""I am not a mechanism borne for the state,"" he spits, ""I had to be trained.""  In
    ""Dead Disnee,"" he fantasizes about visiting a post-apocalyptic Disney World-- a
    bleak prospect considering recent threats from the al Qaeda network.  El-P even
    takes a sharp-witted stab at the <em>Star Wars</em> phenomenon on <i>Fantastic
    Damage</i>'s title track, charasmatically ranting, ""Operate catapults and goosestep
    over the innocent/ Vagrant of Reganomics phase with books to burn at the pod race.../
    This is that Bronx magic, without Lucas Arts graphics/ Crayon colored green
    monsters and horrible child actors.""</p><p>
    
    But while anti-capitalist anthems have always been his specialty, El-P's greatest
    accomplishments on this album are his newfound lyrical abilities, at once
    emotionally resonant and conceptually creative and consistent.  On ""Stepfather
    Factory,"" he fuses his personal and political rage and delivers the record's
    most fully realized concept song.  Affecting the voice of a CEO for a corporation
    manufacturing abusive guardians, El-P softens his caustic howl as he rhymes over
    a dark, looming beat that vividly conjures a corporately oppressive near-future.</p><p>
    
    If Sly Stone phoned up Stockhausen for a presidentially mandated collaboration
    with 10,000 hours of government-granted studio time at Abbey Road, they still
    couldn't have crafted a soundscraper this abrasive, complex, and primal.  An
    infectious retro-futurism informs the parting beat of ""The Nang, The Front,
    The Bush and The Shout""; the chorus of ""Dead Disnee"" is what Devo might sound
    like after spending a few days spun on PCP and meth; and ""Lazerfaces' Warning""
    approximates industrial circus funk.  Then there are the guest appearances:
    while Aesop Rock comes on with a surprisingly disappointing verse, Vast Aire
    drops another nugget of noir swagger on the ""Dr. Hellno and the Praying Mantis.""</p><p>
    
    As tight as <em>Fantastic Damage</em> is, subtlety is definitely not its strong
    suit, and its esoteric and indulgent moments might have been better executed
    with a little smoothing over.  Still, with a sphere of oppression and violence
    hanging over this country, El-P's trenchant examination of our environment and
    inner space is like manna in a desert of irony.  No doubt, El-P has delivered
    both what we'd hoped for and what we need right now.  This is his statement for
    these times, and it's one of the finest hip-hop records I've heard all year.</p></div>"|2712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2712-fantastic-damage/|8.9|Sam Chennault

For you efficient readers     resistant to some patented Pitchfork scaffolding because you spent the night deciding which Gargamel     quote to use in your chat profile, here's the quick review: once upon a time, the White Stripes were     the half-mortal, half-Godzilla missionaries sent to lead rock to its promised land, and their rekkerds     measured up to the hype. These albums contained thunderous, honky-soulful, lacerating pop at various     stages of evolution. <i>De Stijl</i> is better, but only by noses.  The end!  Anyone still Stripe-hungry,     read on:</p>
<p>You probably weren't given the choice of not admiring this fine pair.  Their charm is so bullying that     their fans have become like hog-tied soldiers in the days of impressment, and their sudden crossover     ubiquity threatens to vault them into a saturation-backlash a la the Spice Girls. This week's highlights:</p>
<p>BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA:  An undergrad Design major turns in her final project-- a giant, circular     red-and-white UPC symbol, inspired by the White Stripes' peppermint motif.</p>
<p>SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA:  Two nervy fellas with hopes of being Jerry Bruckheimer's production assistants     become the it-boys of their apartment building's pool when they pump <i>White Blood Cells</i>; their Aiwa     boombox's shuffle feature begins fortuitously with ""Fell In Love with a Girl.""</p>
<p>CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA:  A group of conscientious dropouts walking home from a coffeehouse drumming     circle are hooted at by some ballcapping Thads in a Pathfinder.  One of the dropouts yells a retort.  The     Thads park, exit, and dry-gulch one of the group's males, who will require stitches.  Blasting from the     Pathfinder the whole time: the Stripes' ""Expecting.""</p>
<p>ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO:  Taking his cue from a canny jukebox selection of the treacly ""We're Going to Be     Friends,"" a well-meaning mouth-breather out on the town seduces a tat-dappled Zippo-grrl with his knowledge     of the White Stripes.  When he goes to pee and service his coifed mane, he hears the kitchen staff jamming     on ""I Think I Smell a Rat.""</p>
<p>MTV: Yep.</p>
<p>GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA:  After the forced closure of her aquarium store, a girl gets high and goes to a     24-hour Wal-Mart with a permanent marker.  Her plans to vandalize the pet department are thwarted by a     potty-mouthed fifteen-year-old who runs a shopping cart over her left foot, dismantling her flip-flop and     her pinky toe. The cart's sole contents: a copy of <i>Is This It</i> and a notepad listing the Strokes and     the White Stripes, with the Strokes crossed out.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C.:  Packed venue Black Cat becomes a hub of debate when a guy, sporting a stocking cap     despite the broil, claims that every incarnation of the garage-blues revival is better than the Stripes.     A straight-edge female eventually punctures his facade by tricking him into praising a nonexistent Detroit     Cobras album.</p>
<p>SOY-BASED AIRWAVES:  National Public Radio does a feature bit on the White Stripes. The band's shtick gets     more airtime than their music.  Fans are reportedly color-coordinating their outfits at Stripes shows,     further shearing the curtain between indie rockers and Delta Chi Omegas at homecoming. 'Brother' Jack     righteously plugs the blues, and 'sister' Meg joins him in a shout-out to Mom.</p>
<p>EAU CLAIRE, WISCONSIN:  General Mills test-markets White Stripes cereal.  Participants report a rise in     general sexiness; the swagger index quadruples.  People greet each other with cool, quick nods, slightly     puckering their lips.  Mail carriers make devil-horn hand-gestures to suggest that tailgaters pass.</p>
<p>See, Ryan Pitchfork makes us wear these teal beepers 24-7, even if we're going to a waterslide park.  I     was working at Cinnabon at the mall last week, and he beeped me, and I called him back and he said he     wanted to hear me eating a Cinnabun while I talked to him.  I reminded him I'm hypoglycemic; he reminded     me that he was the boss.  He promised me free Barfsurfer and Hymenella promos.  I ate for him, and     then he said, ""Let's review the old Stripes records that Sympathy never sent us.""  And I said, ""What's     the point?  Nothing new can be said about the Stripes.""  And he said, ""Just compare and contrast, like in     high school.  Reinforce their greatness.  And leave yourself out of the review this time; you're like an     aborted fetus trying to win your parents' love. Richard-San doesn't pull that needy shit.""  Then he asked     if there was a Gingiss Formalwear at my mall, because he wanted to hear sequins crumpling next time we     talked. ""Get gussied up,"" he said, and I said, ""Ai'ight,"" and he said, ""Audi 5000.""  Cinnabon fired me,     but I was tight with this skeezer at Successories, so we just switched aprons.</p>
<p>I'm delaying actually confronting these records because they don't conjure a hunched-before-a-besotted-Compaq     vibe. This band's rock is so imposing that you want to be in some kind of motion to describe it.  You     shouldn't wuss around it, or intellectualize to it.  You'll headbang involuntarily.  You've got to hear     the Stripes' albums; if I explain them to you, you'll picture a novelty band that peaks on a public access     talent show.  But Jack White's in that league with Isaac Brock; some weird, earnest quantity about their     best work (realness, maybe?) deflates irony-dependent artholes, pointing out how lodestone-free our     hands and pockets remain.  You don't want to be the lame-ass clicking a Microsoft mouse in the presence of     this adrenal crunch.</p>
<p>Witnessing <i>White Blood Cells</i> and then <i>De Stijl</i> and then the self-titled debut is similar to     watching the undeveloping photograph that begins the film <i>Memento</i>'s retrograde arc. The listener can     hear how the band leapfrogged to greatness with each release.</p>
<p>The first adjustment that <i>De Stijl</i> requires is that you get used to the guitar not taking up as much     awesome space as it does on <i>White Blood Cells</i>.  And in places, the first-day-with-the-new-rhythm     drums are ""Hotel Yorba"" sloppy, infinitesimally behind.  And Jack sounds nasal every now and then.  That     said, these strong songs hold their own against <i>Cells</i>, as Jack scrapes the strings here and lets     them shriek there-- and when she's on, Meg's channeling of Little Red Riding Bonham leaves potholes.     People pounce on the Stripes' Zep-a-billy, but damn, you've got to respect a band that, while covering Son     House's ""Death Letter,"" compresses all the atmosphere of stadium dinosaurs into a streetcorner act.  No     mere duo's made this much noise since Eric B and Rakim.</p>
<p>The acoustic sweep of ""I'm Bound to Pack It Up"" manages to homage the Who, Floyd, the Kinks and Zep, not     to mention its lofty adherence to the rambler-wanderer tradition.  The crisp ""Apple Blossom"" could be a     <i>Revolver</i> outtake.  The Stripes' blues obsession is more evident here than on <i>Cells</i>; in     addition to the dedication to Blind Willie McTell, songs 7-9 feature some mellow, mellow slide leads, and     ""Hello Operator"" rips into a harp solo.  These gestures are performed with the same heedful regard as the     Stones' similar nods-- a hymnic tone prevents them from oozing into blues-aping caricatures, or the diluted     Caucasian appropriations that clog rock history. The wailing vox of ""Let's Build a Home"" suggest AC/DC's Bon     Scott, another blues-influenced metal god whose act was great when it stuck to making brassy rock about the     hollowing universals of fumbled desire and spiritual homelessness.  You can barely buy the heartbreak     because it's delivered so cockily.</p>
<p>I've alluded to a lot of old-school bands (whoops-- left out Sabbath), but I contend that <i>De Stijl</i> is progressively derivative, as opposed to, say, the Mooney Suzuki, who should be paying royalties to a     handful of bands, some as recent as Mudhoney.  The Stripes' oddly conventional subjects (domesticity,     marriage, optimism) distinguish them, and they have heartiness of style to spare.  The disc's packaging     juxtaposes the band's Willy Wonka fetish with museum pomp; the liner notes contain a manifesto on simplicity,     and God comes first on a list of ""those who helped in the making of this record.""  Opener ""You're Pretty     Good Looking"" best combines the band's skills, and hints at <i>Cells</i>' heavy gleam.  This song flexes     serious pop muscle, and contains the non-sequitur and surrealist touches that give <i>Cells</i> its mystic,     mythic penumbra (backs are broken, thoughts are stolen, the year 2525 looms).  Only <i>Cells</i>' guitar     ballast keeps the legitimately exciting <i>De Stijl</i> in check; the skeleton of the Stripes' breakthrough     was clearly already intact.</p>
<p>The debut is, predictably, an altogether more raw affair, with not enough variations on the theme. Meg's     balancing presence is the only thing saving the album from induction in the saloon-door-violating big-dick     guitarchives.  The album's Detroitness is transparent, and its blues aren't nearly as reconciled with its     punk.  Some of the staccato riffs seem to have speech impediments.  No Beatles ghost triggers the Ouija     board.  A slightly distorted Jack yelps and squeals and sounds tinny by about the twelfth cut, a far cry     from the visceral prophecy and pronunciamento of <i>Cells</i> ""Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground.""</p>
<p>The record is saucy, but ultimately not as arresting as the others, even though the arrangements are just     as winningly unadorned.  Well, except for the tunes where Meg's approaching army tank-tread drums are     reverbed, as if the band is masking their spare sound the way straight-to-video horror movies attempt to     camouflage their low production values.  ""Sucker Drips"" is uncharacteristically thin, and the sassy plod     of ""Astro"" dates back to the, uh, (cough) Cramps.  The cover of Dylan's ""One More Cup of Coffee"" displays     excellent taste and replaces the original's violins (and Emmylou Harris) with some dope organ, but the     tempo-- and Jack's half-tribute sinus inflection-- bring the party down.</p>
<p>Colossal offerings abound, though: the three chords that constitute ""Little People"" embody the sound of rock     insisting on its own supremacy.   The ode to alienation ""When I Hear My Name"" is rife with blistering     ""mmmms"" and ""whoah-ohh-ohh-ohhs.""  A different Blind Willie, this one a Johnson, gets an uncredited updating     on ""Cannon,"" a rousing rendition of the apocalyptic ""John the Revelator.""  Robert Plant's quivering androgyny     gets a thorough reworking on the bratty, double-timing ""Screwdriver.""  Every Brit band who's ever blown an     amp before you were born gets amalgamized on ""Jimmy the Exploder.""  And ass is simply kicked by the falsetto     twists and Pepsi-bottle percussion breakdowns of ""Broken Bricks.""</p>
<p>The debut rocks in turbo-increments, but its statement is fussy and loping.  A standoffish, reclusive element     (manifesting itself in Jack's scream of ""don't wanna be social"") is more disagreeable and difficult than the     entirety of the other, more accommodating records to follow. The puerile veneer that has driven some to judge     the Stripes as stunted in their tweens is yet to emerge, although many fans in their thirties have voiced     gratitude for a band that can be counted on to help them forget that they have kids to beat and dishes to     break.</p>
<p>This scrappy band's not dumb and it ain't a fluke-- the Stripes could do their rock 'n' roll homework in     their sleep.  They linked underground noise to American roots, validating it at long last!  Thank fate that     the Stripes are finally making the indie rock lobby less effing stuffy, after all those tweedy, post-Tortoise     Ph.D'd doops cramped everybody's style!  I want somebody to play their guitar like the four horsemen just     unplugged all the teleprompters!  Who else could pull off the two-person thing? (Not Swearing At Motorists.)     The uniform thing? (Not The Make-Up.) The candy? (Not Sammy.)</p>
<p>Feel no shame in climbing aboard the Stripes' double-decker fanwagon. Just act like you're getting one of     these albums for a less-hip friend, or purchase something really obscure along with it, like a Vocokesh or     When People Were Shorter and Lived Near the Water album.  Hooray for civilization, I didn't talk covetously     about Meg's bod!  We don't need another hero!  Uncross your eyes!  There's gravel in the bubblegum!  This     ain't juvenilia, bitch, it's rawk!</p></div>"|8650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8650-the-white-stripes-and-de-stijl/|8.3|William Bowers

    and explained in textbooks and newsgroups everywhere, to the point of
    sterilization.  So it's become the acceptable social practice not
    to delve too deeply into how the music works.  If music didn't
    contain some inherently mysterious quality, analysis and
    deconstruction would threaten to strip away anything that made it
    unusual, and consequently our interest.  But we still love the
    stuff.</p><p>
    
    What theoretical analysis of music cannot uncover is the inherent
    mystical understanding we have with it.  If notes and words and beats
    are the parts, and if the sum of any piece worth its mortar is always
    greater than all of those, then pinning down anything concrete about
    good music seems to have been a fairly odd objective for me to write
    about from the start.</p><p>
<em>The Skull Mailbox and Other Horrors</em> is a free-form narrative
    about all things strange and dark, related to rural horrors and
    deep-seated fears mistakenly diagnosed as insanity.  Bob Drake sings
    about being pulled upstairs against your will, and not trying to
    fight the ghosts.  His macabre vision, with a preference for skewed
    beauty and purposely misleading moments of clarity, is the driving
    force behind some very colorful music, and probably the reason why
    describing his music is so difficult.  This is unsettling stuff.
    Sometimes it seems funny, in a humiliatingly hopeless kind of way, as
    he lets on with the ghost-upstairs song (""You Can't Outwit That
    Thing"").  The mix of psychological stress, garage-symphony grandeur
    and folk-ish retelling of very familiar horror stories (or at least
    scenarios) tends to defy analysis.</p><p>
    
    Drake has been around.  He started out playing bass and singing a bit
    in the 80's with indie-prog heroes Thinking Plague and Hail.  Their
    brand of quirky, dissonant music has made them very popular in
    straight prog circles, though Drake really didn't cross into the
    mainstream until he began engineering and producing pop acts.  His
    resume includes work with Ice Cube, Quincy Jones, Tina Turner and
    George Clinton, in addition to lending his hands to recent Faust and
    Henry Cow remasters.  Drake is big fucking time, though is apparently
    none too fond of the spotlight, holing up in the south of France in
    his home studio.  <em>The Skull Mailbox</em> is his fourth solo
    release, and similar to his previous records, features his highly
    unorthodox production effects, bluegrass-meets-Steve Howe guitar
    playing and immediately noticeable vocals.  To my ears, he sings like
    Van Dyke Parks in the low register, Jon Anderson in the high.</p><p>
    
    As mentioned, this record covers hauntings and other horrors.  ""They
    Live in the Well"" opens with a bit of semi-classical guitar, mixed
    with a slight folky lilt.  Drake's phrasing is off-kilter to a fault.
    A typical line of verse goes: ""If you take the wrong turn off that
    old dirt road, near that town where they all went insane/ There's a
    patch of blasted weeds where a house used to stand.""  No extraneous
    rhyming or anything, though the melody wouldn't sound out of place on
    a Tom Waits record.  And like Waits, Drake isn't afraid to strike up
    the pump organ for color.  The opening guitar figure returns at the
    end, and the whole thing is wrapped up in a minute-and-a-half.
    <em>The Skull Mailbox</em> crams a whopping 27 songs in the span of
    about 45 minutes.</p><p>
    
    ""The Tower"" features more trad-folk guitar and accordion, and could
    almost pass for an outtake from The Band, if they were going for a
    cornfield-haunting vibe.  ""Cellar of Madness"" goes a bit over the
    top, with Drake's chorus of moaning near the middle, though the
    upbeat violin and accordion take some of the edge off the song's
    general paranoia.  Taking the edge off seems to be one of Drake's
    strengths, as the gorgeous arpeggios of ""The Box in the Orchard"" and
    its accompanying slide guitar solo almost make you forget he's
    singing about finding someone's old hair and bones inside a buried
    box.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Drake's more experimental background comes to the fore.
    ""The Miraculous Reliquary"" begins with about a minute of approaching
    noise, like a rusty old train grinding its way closer to your right
    speaker, stopping just short of a rake in front of the station.
    Drake places shadowy guitar figures underneath a few layers of
    ambient unrest (and this is real ambience, recorded in his barn
    studio, outside noises included), while he sings of hidden items kept
    in a church room ""that should not be.""  The song's coda leaps out of
    the muck as Drake holds back for a second, before proclaiming he saw
    a light ""ascending into heaven!""  over a distorted symphonic
    crescendo.  If movie soundtracks were this good, no one would have to
    go to movies.</p><p>
    
    The best thing about a record like this is not in its cool little
    vignettes, but in the way they all seem to be woven together.  Most
    of the tunes pass by before you really have a chance to discern what
    has happened, and by the end, you might feel like you missed
    something.  In truth, Drake's music is rather complicated, with
    plenty of intricate guitar playing and dense arrangements.
    Furthermore, despite his pedigree as a producer, he favors very messy
    mixes, usually with stuff most people would consider 'mistakes' left
    in.  On the other hand, this is probably another reason why <em>The
    Skull Mailbox</em> is such a compelling listen.  Drake hasn't given me
    anything to hang a cliche or well-worn critical point of contention
    on.  And I can't quite explain why his
    folk-horror-avant-semi-classical hybrid should sound so good-- but it
    does.</p></div>"|2440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2440-the-skull-mailbox-and-other-horrors/|8.6|Dominique Leone

When the
    political message of the music reflected the American youth's
    disenchantment with our country's capitalist, war-mongering system?
    Hard to believe now, but thirty years ago, people genuinely thought a
    new American Revolution was right around the corner, with rock as the
    soundtrack.  The Rolling Stones were accused of endorsing riots in
    ""Street Fighting Man,"" John Lennon waffled over change-by-violence
    on ""Revolution,"" and the Jefferson Airplane canvassed the Woodstock
    mudfolk for ""Volunteers.""</p><p>
    
    And yeah, if you weren't high on the demon weed, it probably all
    sounded about as stupid then as Panthers' political spiel does
    today.  With a CD booklet chock full of manifestos lyrical and
    otherwise, the Panthers' brand of politico-punk none too subtly
    hearkens back to the days when hippie idealism transformed into
    the Manson family.  You don't need a protractor to figure out the
    Panthers' primary influence: the MC5's early incarnation as John
    Sinclair's White Panther Party house band, before future Springsteen
    wrangler Jon Landau watered down their white 'fro sound.</p><p>
    
    To their credit, Panthers got one aspect of revolutionary-era Motor
    City Five down: the moronic ramblings of manager Sinclair-- whose
    dope, guns, and fucking plan of action did more damage to the
    legitimate anti-status quo youth movement than Nixon ever could have.
    Outlining their own militant policy in bite-size fortune-cookie
    segments, Panthers drop such wisdom as, ""We stand for the destruction
    of art in all forms,"" and, ""We are RECKLESS!  Fuck the law!""  Boy,
    <i>that's controversy!</i>  And it's all echoes of Sinclair's 1968
    White Panther Manifesto, with its own deep thoughts like, ""We are
    bad,"" and, ""Leaders suck,"" or the MC5's most enduring statement:
    ""Kick out the jams, mothafuckas!!!""</p><p>
    
    Of course, all this radical mumbo-jumbo is nothing more than a
    smokescreen to hide the fact that Panthers are just a really, really
    crappy band.  It'd be one thing if an act with songs like ""A Panther
    Is a Motherfucker"" and ""Up Against the Wall"" turned out to be chamber
    twee or bluegrass, but it's about the least surprising development in
    the world to find out that their repertoire merely runs the gamut
    from hardcore to punk.  Above the usual mix of boom-thak drums and
    oh-so-angry power chords, vocalist Jayson Green recites tuneless
    lyrics organized in paragraph form.  The one break from the Ian
    MacKaye rulebook is the electric piano intro to ""Sex Ed,"" an absurd
    moment quickly smothered in distortion and Green's boast that Panthers
    ""fuck whomever we damn well please.""  Hey, at least they've got their
    grammar down.</p><p>
    
    Basically, the music and the message meet and shake hands somewhere
    around the maturity level of an angstful 15-year-old.  In light of
    this, the fact that the members of Panthers' ages (helpfully provided
    in the liner notes) fall between 23 and 31 make <em>Are You Down?</em>
    either one of the saddest things I've ever heard, or a ""Mr. Show""
    sketch I haven't gotten to yet on the DVD.   But, you know, maybe
    what's really sad is living in a world where a heartfelt goal like
    ""make pigs pay"" comes off as ludicrous instead of thought-provoking.</p></div>"|6151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6151-are-you-down/|0.7|Rob Mitchum

    are major players in a burgeoning scene that some are calling
    ""microhouse,"" an overly broad label that's been attached to artists
    as varied as Luomo (experimental producer Vladislav Delay in vocal
    house mode), Jan Jelinek (primarily for his work as Farben) and
    artists on the Kompakt label.  I'm not going to embarrass myself by
    attempting a definitive explanation, but generally, microhouse
    happens when minimal house beats meet the glitch approach to sound, a
    combination that's been hinted at for years but is only now beginning
    to flower.</p><p>
    
    Like an absurd number of trends in electronic music in the last ten
    years, microhouse is hitting its stride on a subsidiary of Force
    Inc., the German label that counts Mille Plateaux, Force Tracks, and
    Force Lab among the specialty imprints under its umbrella.  Two
    Lone Swordsmen's Andy Weatherall selected and mixed a breathtakingly
    smooth and appealing compilation on Force Tracks last year called
    <em>Hypercity</em>, documenting one strand of the scene to date.  Three
    tracks on that comp, including the airy and weightless leadoff ""Human
    Patterns,"" were by MRI.</p><p>
    
    ""Human Patterns"" was from MRI's debut <em>Rhythmogenesis</em>, a
    collection of earlier EPs. <em>All That Glitters</em> is their first
    full-length of original material, and it marks a shift to a more pop
    direction.  The final track on this excellent new album is called
    ""Nightclubbing at Home,"" a brilliant title that highlights a smart
    way for listeners to approach the record. Though they're lumped in
    with these other microhouse producers, on <em>All That Glitters</em>,
    MRI approach this meeting place for house rhythms and sonic
    experimentation from the perspective of the dancefloor, and a
    song-friendly one at that. Befitting the club setting, the tracks
    are long (ten in 70 minutes), but they're crammed with interesting
    stuff. This album is not a clinical exercise in the textural
    possibilities inherent in static; MRI are tracking pop hooks and
    disco beats, and they even throw a couple of fine vocal songs into
    the mix. It's big fun to move to, no question, but open-minded Maxell
    guys can still dig it from their low-rider La-Z-Boys.</p><p>
<em>All That Glitters</em> reflects the wide range of Lieb and Elting's
    musical interests, and some of the homages are blatant. ""Data Boogie""
    contains the same vocal sample that opens DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist's
    <em>Brainfreeze</em> (""Hey! Martial arts fans!""), while the downtempo
    ""Blue"" is a weird, inverted cover of Aaliyah's ""Try Again"" (<em>All
    That Glitters</em> is posthumously dedicated to her). ""Sane and Sound""
    has the odd distinction of being the glitchiest track (in terms of
    beats) as well as the more conventional (in structure), as the
    sputtering electric squelches that stand in for percussion smack away
    behind a breezy vocal melody.  Uptempo, danceable instrumental house
    dominates the album, but the detours are frequent enough to make
    <em>All That Glitters</em> work as a varied and complete document.</p><p>
    
    The track that made me fall in love with this record is ""Tied to the
    80s."" The first three minutes or so build steadily, as one new sound
    after another is folded into the mix.  First, the squelchy synth hooks
    come in, then the kick drum, then a slightly dubby bassline.  At the
    end of every 16th bar, the beat breaks down and you can tell the
    track is about to be given an extra thrust in the form of an additional
    element or variation in the sound. But the crowning moment is when an
    unashamedly goofy string sample is introduced-- it sounds to these ears
    like the theme to the pitiful early-80s television drama ""Hart to Hart.""
    This playful and joyous track is representative of MRI's approach on
    <em>All That Glitters</em>. Though they put as much care into microscopic
    sonic detail as any of their contemporaries, they use their sound fetish
    in service of feel-good body music.</p></div>"|5484.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5484-all-that-glitters/|7.8|Mark Richard-San

    Time Relijun and the borderline blackface routine of Jon Spencer and
    his Blues-ploitation, but it's an important one.  Rather than rely or
    clichés, milking them for comedic effect or just for a strutting,
    self-congratulatory wank-off, Old Time Relijun takes the blues and
    twists it into a contorted, freakish figure similar to the way Captair
    Beefheart's early Magic Band did, complete with lyrics that seem pulled
    out of a peyote-eater's dream journal.</p><p>
    
    Old Time Relijun revolves around Olympia-based songwriter/multi-instrumentalist
    Arrington de Dionyso. The band started as a one-man deal, but over time de
    Dionyso recruited other Olympians to help his cause.  For some time now,
    Old Time Relijun's drummer has been Phil Elvrum from the Microphones
    (lo-fi indie rock's great white hope).  He also recorded <i>Witchcraft
    Rebellion</i>, and it features a few of his by-now-expected marks of
    idiosyncratic brilliance, though he mostly keeps the twists and turns to
    a minimum, relying instead on a trebly, tense sound.</p><p>
    
    As his name would seem to suggest, Dionyso sings like some drunker
    ecstatic lunatic when he's not doing his best Beefheart imitation.
    At his strangest and most compelling, he sounds like a Mongoliar
    throat-singing Popeye. Needless to say, it's one of those voices
    you're going to either love or hate immediately-- I happened to love
    it.</p><p>
    
    As for his lyrics, here's a good sample from the disc-opening
    ""Mystery Language"": ""I can take off my head and so can my dad/ In the
    grocery store it falls on the floor...""  You get the idea-- even the
    band's name is cribbed from Beefheart (Mr. Van Vliet's refrain or
    ""Moonlight on Vermont"").  Yet Old Time Relijun have clearly developed
    their eccentricities to such a high degree that they distinguish
    themselves beyond mere imitators.  Those with the aural endurance to
    make it through <em>Witchcraft Rebellion</em>'s early sonic assaults
    will discover hints of dub, Motown, post-punk angularity, and
    hipster-jive poetry strewn throughout the album.</p><p>
    
    ""Cuneform"" starts out like classic Beefheartian chang-ba, but ends
    sounding like a vintage Nick Cave rant-- uh, if Cave had ever ranted
    about archaeology.  Elsewhere, ""Mercury Snake"" is a dirty slow jam
    coupled with the strangled blasts of a sax trying to turn itself 
    inside out, and ""King of Nothing"" sounds like Sebadoh as fronted by
    the aforementioned spinach-eatin' sailor man.</p><p>
    
    The problem with most modern bands who take a lot of their cues from
    Beefheart is that they almost always ignore the wild sense of humor
    present in a lot of his music, focusing instead on Beefheart's more
    serious, conceptual, and high-minded aspects.  I'm mainly thinking of
    U.S. Maple here, and they serve as a good foil to Old Time Relijun ir
    terms of bands heavily influenced by the good Captain.  Old Time
    Relijun takes Beefheart's more playful elements and runs,
    synthesizing them with a shambling melange of clatter and junkyard
    funk.  And in doing so, they transcend their influences by 
    out-conceptualizing the conceptualists.</p></div>"|5968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5968-witchcraft-rebellion/|8.0|Jason Nickey

    coffee, periodically going to the porch to check up with her loafing
    roommates, investigating the dust on the baseboard.  So I've got two
    things to do today, basically:  a) find meaningful, and well-paying
    employment in Chapel Hill; and b) review a Jello Biafra spoken word
    CD.  I have successfully managed to put off writing this review for
    so long that my Pitchfork editors have hired surly tough guys to
    shadow me and threaten to feed my fingers to a vice.  (It's in the
    contract.)</p><p>
    
    The cunning student of letters and/or psychology will note I have
    employed an oft-used rhetorical device to avoid saying anything
    about the record at hand.  For some inexplicable reason, I'm
    drawing a complete blank on witty remarks and scatological epithets
    to hurl at the one-time San Francisco mayoral candidate, ex-Dead
    Kennedy, and master of Lard, so I'll just say in my defense:</p><p>
    
    1) <em>The Big Ka-Boom</em> is a 35-minute anti-war speech delivered to
    a rip-roaring crowd of enthusiastic sophomore political science
    majors and art students at the University of Wisconsin in November of
    2001.  Biafra's riffs on the 9/11 incident, the Bush Administration's
    mode of dealing with the 9/11 incident, the Middle East crisis,
    America's oil habit, the suspension of civil liberties-- none will be
    particularly revelatory to the erudite readers of this screed;</p><p>
    
    2)	Biafra and I sit on roughly the same side of the ideological
    fence. Very little of what he says is objectionable-- in fact, he's
    fairly reasonable and articulate.  Even his tone is friendly.
    Consider it Chomsky Lite, if you will.  All the energy and left-wing
    populist appeal of the MIT linguist/political theorist without the
    high calorie, multi-syllabic vocabulary and self-adulation;</p><p>
    
    3)	One could make a valid argument that Biafra resents the growing
    popularity of Chomsky among sub-25-year-old punk rockers turned
    radical namedroppers, and has resolved to do something about it,
    but that person is not going to be me. I fear the wrath of the
    activist, anarchist, anti-globalization, pseudo-intellectual
    horde who might convene in my front yard to demand my head on a
    pike, to be thrown through the window of the Starbucks on Franklin
    Street;</p><p>
    
    4)	Most of you, understandably, come to Pitchfork for a welcome
    reprieve from political rhetoric.  The people have spoken, and the
    people want to read about Eminem, The Strokes, underground hip-hop,
    puzzling electronica, and Elephant 6 side projects;</p><p>
    
    5)	How in holy hell am I supposed to apply the existing Pitchfork
    rating scale to a speech given to a bunch of college students at the
    University of Michigan?  You want to know if it's good?  Well,
    compared to what?  Radiohead?  Abbie Hoffman?  What constitutes a
    10.0 speech, anyway?  The Gettysburg Address?  Strictly speaking,
    <em>The Big Ka-Boom</em> doesn't even conform to the conventional
    aesthetic excesses of spoken word.  You can nod, clap politely,
    shake a fist every now and then, and maybe raise your voice for a
    good ""By God, you are right, sir!""-- but dancing is patently out of
    the question;</p><p>
    
    6)	 If I tell you precisely what is said, what reason would you
    have to listen to the CD?  I mean, I probably couldn't accurately
    capture the exact tone with which Biafra derisively snorts ""Don't
    Mess With Texas"" when speaking of Dubya, but really, it's a
    speech, people.  While I'm in general agreement with the gist of what
    is said, I'm not completely enamored with the sideshow histrionics of
    its delivery.</p><p>
    
    So, if you were already planning on buying this CD, there's nothing I
    could possibly say to dissuade you, though I <i>will</i> say that
    none of the ideas present on this record are particularly original.
    Better-informed, more articulate political analysts and theorists
    have dedicated pages to the same issues addressed by <em>The Big
    Ka-Boom.</em>  By and large, they don't happen to be former punk rock
    figureheads-- which is ultimately the end-all-be-all of this CD, and
    the source of my reluctance to recommend it.</p></div>"|687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/687-the-big-ka-boom/|5.0|Alison Fields

Do you 
    like lots of instruments, whether they all belong in a song or not? 
    Are you into artists who seem to be full bands at first, but then 
    turn out to be just one guy with lots of musical friends?  Well, if 
    you answered yes to any of those inquiries, come with me, I'd like to 
    take you on a tour of the Mull Historical Society.  If you answered 
    no to all of them, come along anyway-- we won't be long.</p><p>
    
    As your guide to the Mull Historical Society, I'd like to note that 
    it's not my job to stick up for the Society's output so much as it is 
    to inform you about the Society and all it has to offer.  With this
    in mind, let's proceed directly to an overview before delving a little
    more deeply:  Mull Historical Society is not a full band, nor even a
    society, but rather the creative vehicle of songwriter Scottish Colin
    MacIntyre.  MacIntyre nets a massive haul of guest players, choirs and 
    orchestras to serve his compositions, in much the same way that Neil
    Hannon used to for the Divine Comedy, or, perhaps more aptly, in the 
    same way that Jake Shillington does for My Life Story.  The vintage of
    his songcraft is probably about 1971 or so, though the production and
    arranging techniques he implements are more modern.</p><p>
    
    MacIntyre's voice is a high, nasal whine, extremely similar to Kevin 
    Junior of the Chamber Strings, or kind of like Lindsay Buckingham 
    with a slight cold.  It serves his classicist pop melodies quite 
    well, and you could never accuse him of writing out of his range or 
    being off in his delivery.  The real problem arises from the fact 
    that, while his songs are fundamentally simple, MacIntyre would 
    prefer you didn't realize how basic they are, piling on everything 
    and the kitchen sink in a transparent attempt to cover up the lacking
    songwriting.  The supersize approach works for some of the songs, but
    by and large, these tracks suffocate under overambitious arrangements.</p><p>
    
    The good news is, there are some really good songs here-- even if 
    some of them are hidden under impenetrable piles of arrangement.  And 
    there are even a few that aren't hidden at all, like ""This Is Not Who 
    We Were,"" one of the few songs that gets up off its ass and ramps up 
    the tempo up a bit.  It almost rocks!  ""Animal Cannabus"" gets by 
    mostly unscathed, too, though a preponderance of add-on synths and 
    bells threatens it several times.</p><p>
    
    The best song, though, is probably ""Watching Xanadu.""  Why, if it had 
    only been released 27 years ago, you'd be hearing it on those midnight
    ads for those <em>AM Gold</em> CDs that nobody actually seems to have
    in their collection when you come to visit.  Still, it'll certainly get
    the guilty pleasure juice boiling in your loins, with its remarkably 
    infectious chorus and swooning Burt Bacharach candor.</p><p>
    
    But then there's the rest, and though you could hardly call any of it 
    flat out bad, most of it suffers from one or more afflictions that 
    keep it from being all that engaging.  ""Barcode Bypass"" is probably 
    the sparsest song here, and its weird, dark choral ending is pretty 
    neat, but god only knows why they chose to drag it out to the 
    seven-minute mark, stretching it further than it could realistically 
    stay interesting.  ""Public Service Announcer"" and ""I Tried"" collapse 
    under their own weight before they can really get going anywhere; 
    ""Only I"" is like Rufus Wainwright Jr. with a bigger orchestra and an 
    overload of trumpet bombast.</p><p>
    
    ""Mull Historical Society"" functions not only as MacIntyre's signature 
    song, but also as his project's aggressive human resources department,
    beckoning ""Come on and join us"" over and over again amidst a ridiculous
    arrangement of horns, synthesized steel drums and electronics that's
    so cluttered it makes my desk look orderly.  The Mull Historical Society
    Children's Choir struggles to inject life into the leaden beat of
    ""Instead,"" but can barely be heard over the orchestra and a barrage
    of effects.</p><p>
    
    And that concludes our little tour.  At this point, you should have a 
    fairly good idea of what to expect from Mull Historical Society. 
    Really, if MacIntyre didn't overpopulate his songs with so many 
    sounds, he could have a pretty decent record on his hands.  But as it 
    stands, he does, and it hurts this album a lot.  Less is more, and 
    <em>Loss</em> is middling.</p></div>"|5499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5499-loss/|6.1|Joe Tangari
